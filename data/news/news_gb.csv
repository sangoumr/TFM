gb,Donald Trump Addresses Failure To Meet Signature Campaign Pledge,"President Donald Trump sits for an interview with ""Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson"" broadcast on March 16, 2025.US President Donald Trump has addressed the failure to meet one of his most significant campaign pledges.During his 2024 presidential bid, Trump repeatedly pledged to end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours.” Now, nearly two months after his inauguration, the three-year conflict continues to rage.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump, though, claimed he didn’t mean that campaign promise literally.“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that,” Trump told Full Measure. “What I really mean is I’d like to get it settled, and I think I’ll be successful.”Still, during the buildup to the 2024 presidential race, Trump appeared unequivocal in his assertions that he could bring a prompt closure to the war, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity in March 2023 he could “fix” the conflict as soon as he won the presidential election.“I would fix that within 24 hours, and if I win, before I get into the office, I will have that war settled,” he added. “One hundred percent sure.”Since then, he has made similar claims multiple times, including during the ABC News debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris in September.“If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said at the time.During the Full Measure interview, Trump also referred to the 30-day ceasefire proposal the US has made to both Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv has already green-lit the plan, but the Kremlin has yet to confirm its approval.Asked about what he is prepared to do if Russian President Vladimir Putin refuses to back the ceasefire, Trump didn’t offer a direct response, noting that it would be “bad news for this world.”“I think he’s going to agree, I really do,” Trump said of Putin. “I think I know him pretty well, and I think he’s going to agree.”We just finished interviewing President Trump.

gb,Amazon Spring Sale deals include the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for 20 percent off,"The Amazon Spring Sale has made me jealous — I'm envious of those who can now pick up Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones at a record-low price, as someone who paid full price for them long ago. Our top picks for the best wireless headphones you can buy are on sale for $318, which represents a 20 percent discount. The sale is available on the Silver and Smoky Pink models. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony's XM5 headphones are one of them. I've raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they're so comfortable. I've worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time. Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they're a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn't hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don't have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive). Their excellence on flights isn't the only reason we gave Sony's XM5 headphones a 95 in our review. They're also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound's quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy. This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don't quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

Their excellence on flights isn't the only reason we gave Sony's XM5 headphones a 95 in our review. They're also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound's quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy. This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don't quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.
