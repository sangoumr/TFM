gb,Donald Trump Addresses Failure To Meet Signature Campaign Pledge,"President Donald Trump sits for an interview with ""Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson"" broadcast on March 16, 2025.US President Donald Trump has addressed the failure to meet one of his most significant campaign pledges.During his 2024 presidential bid, Trump repeatedly pledged to end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours.” Now, nearly two months after his inauguration, the three-year conflict continues to rage.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Trump, though, claimed he didn’t mean that campaign promise literally.“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that,” Trump told Full Measure. “What I really mean is I’d like to get it settled, and I think I’ll be successful.”Still, during the buildup to the 2024 presidential race, Trump appeared unequivocal in his assertions that he could bring a prompt closure to the war, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity in March 2023 he could “fix” the conflict as soon as he won the presidential election.“I would fix that within 24 hours, and if I win, before I get into the office, I will have that war settled,” he added. “One hundred percent sure.”Since then, he has made similar claims multiple times, including during the ABC News debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris in September.“If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said at the time.During the Full Measure interview, Trump also referred to the 30-day ceasefire proposal the US has made to both Ukraine and Russia. Kyiv has already green-lit the plan, but the Kremlin has yet to confirm its approval.Asked about what he is prepared to do if Russian President Vladimir Putin refuses to back the ceasefire, Trump didn’t offer a direct response, noting that it would be “bad news for this world.”“I think he’s going to agree, I really do,” Trump said of Putin. “I think I know him pretty well, and I think he’s going to agree.”We just finished interviewing President Trump.

gb,Amazon Spring Sale deals include the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for 20 percent off,"The Amazon Spring Sale has made me jealous — I'm envious of those who can now pick up Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones at a record-low price, as someone who paid full price for them long ago. Our top picks for the best wireless headphones you can buy are on sale for $318, which represents a 20 percent discount. The sale is available on the Silver and Smoky Pink models. There are few tech products I would recommend to anyone, but Sony's XM5 headphones are one of them. I've raved so much about them that my parents and brother all bought a pair (while my partner uses mine about as often as I do). One of the biggest things for me, as someone who gets headaches easily, is that they're so comfortable. I've worn them on quite a few overnight flights now and can easily keep them on the whole time. Speaking of flights, the active noise cancellation is another reason they're a treat for those overnight hauls. The XM5s have double the processors and and microphones for ANC as their predecessor. I once slept two rows away from a crying baby and, with music on, I couldn't hear a thing. Plus, the 30 hours of battery life means I don't have to worry about them dying half way through my travels (my AirPods always need to recharge in their case before I arrive). Their excellence on flights isn't the only reason we gave Sony's XM5 headphones a 95 in our review. They're also great for listening to music while working or out for a walk. The XM5s have 30mm carbon fiber drivers and DSEE Extreme, together boosting the sound's quality and depth. My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy. This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don't quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

My only complaint is that the M5s don't fold up, but especially at this price, they're still such a great buy. This discount is part of a larger sale on headphones and earbuds for the Amazon Spring Sale. If the XM5s don't quite meet your criteria, there are other models on sale from Beats, Bose and other brands.

Three killed in Israeli bombing of Gaza’s Zeitoun neighbourhood An Israeli air strike on Wadi al-Arayes Street in Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood has killed at least three Palestinians, reported Al Jazeera Arabic. Nine killed in Israeli air strikes across Gaza since dawn Israeli air strikes have killed nine Palestinians across the Gaza Strip since dawn on Monday, as bombardment intensifies in multiple areas. Belgian PM says Netanyahu would not be arrested if he visited Belgium Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever has made it clear: if Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu set foot in Belgium, he wouldn’t be arrested.Speaking to VRT television on Thursday, De Wever dismissed the idea, saying practical considerations take precedence over ethics when it comes to international diplomacy.“There is such a thing as realpolitik. Within that framework, practical considerations prevail over ethical ones,” he said. “I don’t think there is a single European country that would arrest Mr Netanyahu if he went there. France, for example, wouldn’t—and I don’t think we would either.”His remarks came as Hungary, just ahead of Netanyahu’s state visit, announced it had begun the process of withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), raising further questions about Europe’s stance on war crimes and accountability. Gaza death toll rises to 13 as Israeli air strikes continue The number of Palestinians killed in Gaza since dawn today has risen to 13, as Israeli air strikes continue multiple areas across the besieged Strip. Palestinian-American teen killed by Israeli army in the occupied West Bank A 14-year-old Palestinian-American, Omar Mohammad Rabea, was shot dead by the Israeli army in Turmus Ayya, a West Bank town, on Sunday. Rabea, along with two other Palestinian-American boys, aged 14 and 15, were also shot and wounded at the entrance to the town. The mayor, Adeeb Lafi, confirmed that two of the teens were rushed to a medical centre, while the third, Rabea, was detained by Israeli soldiers before being pronounced dead. Israel’s military confirmed it killed what it called a “terrorist.”""Two of them were transported by ambulance to a nearby medical center and then to the hospital. The army arrived at the scene and detained the third injured boy, who is 14 years old and holds US citizenship,"" Lafi said.The Palestinian health ministry confirmed Rabea's death, attributing it to ""occupation forces."" Omar Mohammad Rabea, a 14-year-old Palestinian-American killed by the Israeli army (Social Media) At least 15,000 children killed in Gaza by Israel: Save the Children Save the Children’s’s spokesperson in Gaza has delivered a grim warning, stating that 15,000 children have been killed in the ongoing conflict. In an interview with Al Jazeera, the official described the appalling scale of displacement, with 1.9 million people now uprooted from their homes.“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and health workers have left no safe place for children, civilians, or health staff in Gaza,” they said.The humanitarian crisis continues to escalate as over 50 trucks of aid remain stuck, unable to reach those in desperate need, said Save the Children’s. Ten British-Israeli soldiers accused of war crimes in Gaza Ten British citizens who served in the Israeli military are facing accusations of war crimes in Gaza, The Guardian reported on Monday.A 240-page dossier, compiled by human rights lawyers, is set to be handed over to the Metropolitan Police. The report, submitted by the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and the London-based Public Interest Law Centre, alleges serious violations committed between October 2023 and May 2024.According to the report the accused—some of whom are Israeli officers—are implicated in indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, including hospitals, as well as mass displacement and strikes on protected sites. The dossier also accuses them of deliberately targeting civilians and aid workers, with some actions potentially constituting crimes against humanity.While the full report, which names the soldiers, will not be made public for legal reasons, it was drafted by UK human rights lawyers alongside researchers in The Hague.

gb,Gaza medic killings: How a voice from beyond the grave destroyed Israel's lie,"Gaza medic killings: How a voice from beyond the grave destroyed Israel's lie Submitted by Soumaya Ghannoushi on Mon, 04/07/2025 - 16:57 As he lay dying, Rifaat Radwan recorded the slaughter of his colleagues, debunking the army's version of events Rifaat Radwan was among 15 emergency workers killed by Israeli forces in Rafah, Gaza, on 23 March 2025 (Social media) Off “Mum, forgive me. This is the path I chose. I wanted to help people. Forgive me, mum. I swear, I only took this path to help people.”These were the final words of Rifaat Radwan, a young Palestinian paramedic in Gaza. He spoke them while bleeding to death by a clearly marked ambulance, encircled by Israeli soldiers, under the cold night sky of Rafah.He had gone out with his crew to save the wounded. None would return.The Israeli army opened fire without warning, killing Radwan and 14 other emergency workers. Their bodies were later unearthed from a shallow grave, some with their hands or legs tied, apparently shot at close range.They were executed, still in uniform, holding their radios, gloves and medical kits. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); And still, Israel lied. Its foreign minister told the world the ambulances were unmarked and “suspicious”, suggesting the Israeli attack was justified.But footage of Radwan’s final moments showed the ambulances were clearly marked, with lights flashing and medical vests visible. There was no sign of any threat, no crossfire, no ambiguity - only what appears to have been a deliberate massacre.Erasure of life itselfAs the world tried to comprehend the horror in Rafah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood in Hungary, celebrated by one of Europe’s most far-right governments. Flanked by ultra-nationalists, he declared: “This is important for all of us, for all of civilisation, as we fight this battle against barbarism ... I believe we are fighting a similar battle for the future of our common civilisation - our Judeo-Christian civilisation.”Nothing could more obscenely invert the truth.Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine warWhat Israel is waging in Gaza is not war - it is the erasure of life itself. It is the systematic destruction of anything that breathes or dreams. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); More than 1,000 health and medical professionals have been killed since October 2023, including dozens from the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Medics have been bombed, shelled and shot while performing lifesaving work. More than 400 aid workers have been killed in Gaza, including at least 280 Unrwa staff. Hospitals have been obliterated and ambulances torn apart. Doctors have been arrested, tortured, raped, and executed.Symbols once sacred - the Red Crescent vest, the white coat, surgical scrubs - are now treated as targetsAmong them were the medics sent to rescue six-year-old Hind Rajab. She had survived an Israeli attack that killed her entire family. Alone in a car, terrified, she called for help. A rescue team was dispatched but never returned.Hind’s body was eventually found in a car riddled with bullets. The responding medics lay nearby, executed while trying to save a child.There are no red lines - not for doctors or children, nor even for the dying.Palestinian medics say their uniforms don’t protect them; they mark them for death. Symbols once sacred - the Red Crescent vest, the white coat, surgical scrubs - are now treated as targets.One nurse, mid-surgery, refused to abandon a patient when Israeli soldiers stormed their hospital. They shot him in the knee, shattered the bone, and later dragged him away, according to another doctor’s account. He was tortured, blinded, and eventually dumped on the side of the road in severe condition.Adnan al-Bursh, Gaza’s leading orthopaedic surgeon, was taken from al-Awda hospital and disappeared into the Israeli prison system, where he was reportedly beaten, raped and left to die. War of exterminationNetanyahu does not just destroy homes, mosques, churches and schools. He destroys the means to survive. If the bombs don’t kill, then thirst, hunger, or untreated wounds will. And those who try to save others? They are hunted.In Gaza, medicine is rebellion, and compassion is treason. To heal is to defy extermination.More than 55,000 Palestinians have been killed, and entire neighbourhoods have been wiped out. More than 1.9 million people have been displaced, with many later bombed in their tents. The graver Israel's atrocities in Gaza, the quieter the BBC grows Read More »Since the so-called ceasefire was broken, the horror has reached new depths. Food is gone, fuel has vanished, and water plants are silent. Gaza’s bakeries have collapsed. Families drink sewage and eat animal feed. They bleed from wounds that no one is left to treat.This is Israel’s war for “civilisation”.Jonathan Whittall, acting director of the UN’s humanitarian office in the occupied Palestinian territories, describes it as “a war without limits”. Israel has trampled every line of law, ethics and decency. No zone is safe, no hospital spared, no child immune. This is not a conflict; it is annihilation, unbound.And the lie that fuels it has been generations in the making. For decades, the image of the “violent Palestinian” has been broadcast to the world - a modern colonial myth. Israel casts itself as a beacon of democracy, a bastion of civility under siege. Tel Aviv built the story, Washington armed it, London printed it, and Hollywood sold it.But it was never true. It was propaganda - polished, rehearsed and weaponised.Genocidal policyIn Gaza, the illusion has collapsed. Even within Israel, some are beginning to see this. Omer Bartov, a renowned Israeli-American historian of genocide, visited the country in 2024 and spoke with students returning from military service in Gaza. They were angry, disillusioned, demanding total war. He warned them of the last time a generation of humiliated students embraced militarism: 1930s Nazi Germany. Bartov also wrote last summer that “it was no longer possible to deny that Israel was engaged in systematic war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocidal actions”.Tom Segev, one of Israel’s most respected historians, has noted: “At the age of 80 I’m starting to think that maybe it wasn’t right from the outset, the whole Zionist thing ... Zionism is not such a great success story. It also doesn’t provide security to Jews. It’s safer for Jews to live outside Israel.”This genocide is not accidental, nor is it a tragic byproduct of war. It is policy.An Israeli officer was recently filmed ordering troops in the Golani Brigade to treat anyone they see in Gaza as a threat, and to kill without hesitation. No need to distinguish between civilian or combatant, child or adult, mother or medic - just shoot. Every Palestinian life is pre-condemned. Guilt is assumed. A pulse is a provocation.At the same time, Israel’s Supreme Court - praised globally as a liberal institution - has unanimously rejected petitions to lift the blockade on Gaza on humanitarian grounds. Not a single judge questioned the legality of starving a trapped population, including children.This isn’t just Netanyahu and his fascist ministers. It’s the army, the courts, the state itself. Every pillar is aligned in the machinery of extermination. This is what Zionism has built: a regime that executes medics, buries doctors in mass graves, shoots children, and calls it civilisation.Bearing witnessBut against that darkness stands Rifaat Radwan. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); In his final moments, he didn’t speak of vengeance. He turned to his mother and asked for forgiveness. He affirmed the path he chose - not to destroy, but to heal.Even as his life drained away, Radwan bore witness. Bleeding to death amid a convoy of ambulances, he recorded the massacre. There were no journalists or international observers present. He understood that if he didn’t speak, the truth would die with him. So he spoke.He knew what came next. Israel would kill, then lie. It would release another media statement to repackage murder as self-defence. He knew the pattern, but he refused to be erased. With his final breaths, he told the truth.He rose from the grave to speak, so the world could not look away. He rose so no one could ever say 'we didn't know'Radwan was gunned down and tossed in a pit, but his voice rose from the grave. His testimony survived the bullets, his story shattering the lie. He told the world what his killers tried to bury: that even mercy is now a crime. That to save a life in Gaza is to sign your own death warrant.In doing so, he won. Israel did not get its silence. The mask slipped. The world cannot say “we didn’t know”.Radwan rose - not only in spirit, but in defiance. He rose above fear, above propaganda, above death itself. In a world numbed by numbers, he restored humanity to the story.He ran towards fire, towards rubble, towards the wounded. He did not flinch. He chose truth over silence.And now, Radwan stands as a monument to all Israel tried to crush: a symbol of dignity, the counterweight to cruelty.His name - from the Arabic root رفع - means to rise. And he did: he rose from the grave to speak, so the world could not look away. He rose so no one could ever say “we didn’t know”.The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.

This is the path I chose. I wanted to help people. Forgive me, mum. I swear, I only took this path to help people.”These were the final words of Rifaat Radwan, a young Palestinian paramedic in Gaza. He spoke them while bleeding to death by a clearly marked ambulance, encircled by Israeli soldiers, under the cold night sky of Rafah.He had gone out with his crew to save the wounded. None would return.The Israeli army opened fire without warning, killing Radwan and 14 other emergency workers. Their bodies were later unearthed from a shallow grave, some with their hands or legs tied, apparently shot at close range.They were executed, still in uniform, holding their radios, gloves and medical kits. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); And still, Israel lied. Its foreign minister told the world the ambulances were unmarked and “suspicious”, suggesting the Israeli attack was justified.But footage of Radwan’s final moments showed the ambulances were clearly marked, with lights flashing and medical vests visible. There was no sign of any threat, no crossfire, no ambiguity - only what appears to have been a deliberate massacre.Erasure of life itselfAs the world tried to comprehend the horror in Rafah, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood in Hungary, celebrated by one of Europe’s most far-right governments. Flanked by ultra-nationalists, he declared: “This is important for all of us, for all of civilisation, as we fight this battle against barbarism ... I believe we are fighting a similar battle for the future of our common civilisation - our Judeo-Christian civilisation.”Nothing could more obscenely invert the truth.Follow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine warWhat Israel is waging in Gaza is not war - it is the erasure of life itself. It is the systematic destruction of anything that breathes or dreams.

In this case, Ireland handles EU regulation enforcement because X's European headquarters are in Dublin.The DPC said it will probe ""the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the 'X' social media platform by EU/EEA users.""

Ever. Ever,” said Attorney General Pam Bondi. “Never seen anything like it. Thank you.”President Donald Trump speaks with his Cabinet after reports that the U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, fueled by a massive surge in imports ahead of the administration's expected tariffs.Trump continues to claim that the tariffs he imposed on imports would make the country rich while failing to point out that US importers pay that tax, not exporting nations and companies.In an interview with ABC News broadcast on Tuesday night, Trump turned tourism statistics — which are showing a drop-off in foreign visitors to the United States ― on their head. “Tourism is way up,” he said. “Tourism is doing very well.”And when faced with metrics too well-known to be refuted with casual falsehoods, Trump has used a favourite deflection: blamingpredecessor Joe Biden.Trump has long been eager to take credit for the stock market’s rise, and did so repeatedly after his November election win.“Everyone is calling it the — I don’t want to say this. It’s too braggadocious, but we’ll say it anyway — the Trump effect,” he said on January 19, the day before he retook office.Since then, markets fell with the prospect of Trump’s coming trade warand then further tumbled after Trump’s April 2 announcement of tariffs on all foreign countries. They are now down about 7% since the start of his term, and Trump has since changed his story to disclaim any responsibility. “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th,” he wrote, and then implored his fans: “BE PATIENT!!!”One of Trump’s clear successes is in reducing the number of migrants trying to cross into the United States from Mexico to near zero —although how much of this is due to tougher enforcement and how much is due to Trump turning the US into a place that those seeking freedom and opportunity no longer wish to enter is unclear.Even that accomplishment, though, has been offset by the public’s lack of support for Trump’s eagerness to round up migrants and deport them without a court hearing, even sending hundreds or thousands of them to a notorious Salvadoran prison with no prospect of release.Indeed, the border and immigration remain Trump’s best issues in recent polling, and even on those, he is barely above 50% support, as irritation about his failure to lower costs as he repeatedly promised he would during his campaign and concern about economic conditions getting worse have sent his approval ratings spiralling downward.Trump’s overall approval rating, which started at over 50% in late January, is now in the mid-40s, with his approval on handling inflation in the upper 30s.During a disjointed and meandering 90-minute speech on Tuesday night in which he meant to take a victory lap for all his accomplishments thus far, Trump falsely accused the news media of publishing inaccurate polls to make him look bad.“They say Trump only has a 44% approval rating. Well, it’s actually not bad. But when you figure that, if it were a legit poll, it would be in the 60s or 70s,” he told an audience of a few thousand attending his rally in Warren, Michigan.Nevertheless, Trump seems keenly aware that his trade war, particularly his 145% import tax rate against Chinese goods, is likely to create shortages while simultaneously increasing prices. In an unusual statement on Wednesday, he seemed to boost anti-consumerism while inadvertently acknowledging that American importers and consumers are the ones who pay tariffs, not foreign nations and exporters.“Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open,” he said at his Cabinet meeting. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”",en,"Trump’s Actual Economy Is Tanking 100 Days In, So He Is Fantasising A Great One","!function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document,c=n.createElement('script');c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document);(new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b';cnx.cmd.push(function(){cnx({""playerId"":""ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b"",""mediaId"":""ef2c261d-7527-4511-8c61-f0ad0a51d7f0""}).render(""681302e3e4b0a346f101f5d9"");});Unhappy that his trade war appears to be running the strong economy he inherited into a ditch, President Donald Trump is selling Americans a fantasy version of his first 100 days in office in which everything is going just great.“I think it’s the most consequential 100 days in the history of our country,” he said in a White House speech on Wednesday afternoon, repeating a theme from earlier in the day.“We’ve just completed what many consider to be the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country,” Trump declared at his Cabinet meeting, just hours after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy had actually shrunk in the first three months of the year, a strong sign of an impending recession. “Things are happening that are amazing.”Trump’s agency heads and top aides ― whom he appointed and whom he can fire in an instant — chimed in to agree.“Mr. President, your first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country.
