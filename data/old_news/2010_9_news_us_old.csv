The study, one of the largest of its kind, involved almost 1,400 runners, from age 13 to past 60, who were assigned randomly to two groups. The first group did not stretch before their runs, while otherwise maintaining their normal workout routine: the same mileage, warm-up (minus any stretching) and so on. The second group stretched, having received photographs and specific instructions for a series of simple, traditional poses, like leaning over and touching toes, that focused on the calf, hamstring and quadriceps muscles. The volunteers were told to hold each stretch for 20 seconds, a technique known as static stretching. The entire routine required three to five minutes and was to be completed immediately before a run.",2010-09-01T04:01:16+0000

This fun fact is one of hundreds in Bespoke: The Mens Style of Savile Row (Rizzoli), a new tome as handsome as its subject. Up front, the author James Sherwood clears up any uncertainty fogging the much-abused term: To earn the label bespoke a garment must be measured, cut and sewn by hand; the pattern must also be hand-cut. When the pioneers of custom British tailoring took their first orders in the early 1800s, they were for clothes inspired by the honest wardrobe of the English country gentleman. In 1929 Hawkes & Co. did the unthinkable by introducing immediate wear to Savile Row, and by 1948, sales of the firms off-the-peg suits surpassed those of bespoke. Its a trend that has never been reversed, though not for want of trying. In the 90s, Richard Anderson, Ozwald Boateng and Richard James opened shops, forming what Sherwood tags The New Establishment. And Edward Sexton, Spencer Hart and Timothy Everest are currently powering a Row Renaissance. Bespoke is especially good on the crazy language peculiar to the Row.

I consider it progress that every young person doesnt feel the need to complete school, leave home, marry and have a child by a certain deadline. There is no one size fits all adulthood. Lets not forget it was the boomers who created the 50 percent divorce rate, who initiated the corporate-casual workplace, who made 60 the new 40. Todays 20-somethings just want what we all want: the opportunity to live life on our own terms and in our own time frames.",2010-09-03T14:19:46+0000

us,California Lawmakers Approve Stolen-Art Bill,"California lawmakers have given final approval to a bill that would extend the time in which people can sue museums to recover what they believe are stolen works of art. A spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he had not decided whether to sign the bill, which would give people six years to file a claim instead of the current three. The legislation, approved this week, grew out of cases in which time became a factor in litigation involving art looted by the Nazis. California once had a law that set no time limit on such claims, but it was struck down as unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this year. Without that law, courts have generally held that the statute of limitations governing stolen art begins when the claimant discovers the works whereabouts, or when they should have discovered it with reasonable diligence (because the work, for example, was posted on a museums Web site or featured in an exhibition). Under the new legislation, which governs claims against museums, galleries and auction houses, plaintiffs are freed from any reasonable-diligence provision and the clock does not start until plaintiffs have gathered enough information to evaluate whether they have valid claims. The California Association of Museums has described the bill as unnecessary, unfair, unconstitutional and disruptive of property rights.",2010-09-03T21:27:12+0000

Pfizer licensed rights to the product in 2008 from Celldex for as much as $440 million, plus royalties. If approved, the brain cancer vaccine could have $450 million in peak annual sales and come on the market in 2013, Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital, said in May. Celldexs chief executive, Anthony Marucci, said the company would need to raise more money to pay for late-stage testing but would not need another partner.

Bennett, said Thursday during a conference call about fiscal first-quarter earnings. The call included repeated queries about claims, which have totaled more than $680 million. H&R Block originated mortgages through January 2008, and some were sold to become part of mortgage-backed securities. The companys mortgage buyback liability remains within our reserved expectations, and we continue to view related reserves as adequate, the chief financial officer, Jeffrey T. Brown, said. H&R Block reported a loss from continuing operations of $127.6 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ending July 10, compared with $130.6 million, or 39 cents, in the same period last year. Its net loss narrowed to $130.7 million from $133.6 million. Shares of H&R Block, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., rose 73 cents, or 6 percent, to $13.30. ",2010-09-04T01:31:52+0000

Still, this is a team on the rise after finishing 8-8 last season, coupling a premier N.F.L. defense (fourth best in points allowed in 2009) with the hope that quarterback Alex Smith will make a big leap by playing the same offense for two consecutive years. Smith is surrounded by plenty of talent, including tight end Vernon Davis and the emerging receiver Michael Crabtree. Do not look for Smith to finally get to use the spread offense he prefers, though. Singletary wants to be an old-school, smash-mouth team  he defined that style as a player  and the Niners upgraded their offensive line in the draft to that end.

If his line does not get Rodgers killed, the way it nearly did early last season, the offense will again be one of the most productive in the N.F.L. (The Packers were third in points scored last season.) The defense was seventh in points allowed, and although Al Harris and Charles Woodson are among the best cornerback tandems in the league, they are each at least 33 and injuries are taking a toll. Harris (knee) is on the physically unable to perform list and unavailable for at least six games.

The first-team offense struggled in the preseason; Mark Sanchez still makes too many mistakes, and the offensive line looked spotty. But the surprise was how much life appeared in LaDainian Tomlinsons legs.

The passing game, even without Jackson, is deep and explosive and figures only to get better now that teams have to pay attention to Ryan Mathews instead of LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the 31st-ranked rushing offense last season. Still, you get the feeling the window is about to close on this team. Several big names, like linebacker Shawne Merriman and returner Darren Sproles, are in their contract years, and the Chargers simply cant keep racing through the regular season (they won their final 11 games in 2009 and have one of the easiest schedules this season) only to collapse in the playoffs.

He opened a program of the festival orchestra (he was supposed to have led all of it), conducting the first movement of Tchaikovskys Serenade for Strings. Then, because he was experiencing sciatic problems that recurred as a byproduct of the surgery, he stepped aside to let a younger conductor, Tatsuya Shimono, take over. When Mr. Ozawa, right, took the stage, he was greeted as warmly as the politest of audiences could manage: no standing, no cheering, but loud, sustained applause. Half standing, half sitting, he delivered brief remarks from the stage, explaining his difficulties, apologizing for being unable to do more and promising to be back next year. Then he conducted the movement, mostly standing and with typically vigorous gestures. The orchestra, obviously charged up for the occasion, delivered a searingly intense performance. Rhythmic clapping broke out after the concert, directed at Mr. Ozawa in the audience, and he half ran to greet Mr. Shimono and the players onstage.",2010-09-05T22:45:43+0000

For Yurman, the 50s were the golden era of American design, and not just in the automobile industry. I tip my hat to it and hope I can only add to this legacy.

Several other publications also criticized Mr. Dylans talent, and the museum, known in Denmark as the Statens Museum for Kunst, for picking the show because of the artists commercial appeal instead of the artistic value.

That high estimate was based on last years old masters sale, when a drawing by Raphael sold for $47.9 million and a painting by Rembrandt went for $33.2 million. The seven paintings in the Poussin series were sold to the Belvoir estate of the Dukes of Rutland in the late 18th century.

Construction of the dam, which is to be the worlds third largest, will require the flooding of 200 square miles of the Xingu River basin. Opposition groups say the flooding will displace about 12,000 people and destroy the fishing industry, but the Brazilian government maintains that the lands will not be harmed and that it is taking environmental issues into consideration. In an interview Sunday in the newspaper Folha de So Paulo, Mr. Cameron said that when the Xikrin-Kayap leaders asked for his help, he could not turn away. I want to take a 3-D camera to film how they live, their culture, he added. Mr. Cameron has made previous trips to Brazil to show his support and has already made a short film about the issue, which will be included on the forthcoming Avatar special-edition DVD.

us,Phys Ed: How to Fix a Bad Tennis Shoulder,"For a study published a few years ago in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers at the High Performance National Training Center in Argentina X-rayed the shoulders of 18 elite older tennis players, both men and women. Each of the 18, between the ages of 51 and 75, had at one time played professionally, and all were still active in tennis, as either competitors or teachers. None had experienced any unusual shoulder pain or problems. But when radiologists reviewed the players X-rays, they found signs of osteoarthritis, or loss of joint cartilage, in a third of the players dominant shoulders (generally the right). Shoulder X-rays from an age-matched group of Argentines who didnt play tennis turned up arthritic changes in only 11 percent of the group. With understandable circumspection, the authors, operating under the auspices of the Argentine Tennis Association, concluded that years of intensive tennis practice may be a predisposing factor for the development of mild degenerative articular changes in the dominant shoulder. Playing tennis, in other words, might be gnawing away at the joint.",2010-09-08T04:01:10+0000

Novels like this suggest hidden connections between disparate sets of characters, although the spectacle of sheer juxtaposition  of incongruous stories slyly interpolated  is also part of their appeal. Sometimes major characters in one story become secondary characters in others. Or unexpected events ripple through the separate sections, providing an accidental link. To give their narrative centrifuge a provisional stability, novelists sometimes employ a framing device. Why not, for example, set ones alternating stories in  of course!  a hotel?

I realized this was one of the first news stories I had ever totally believed  in part because it was like something from fiction. Even if it hadnt happened yet, it could happen, and therefore probably would.

And in a world where fiction is becoming indistinguishable from reality, as the philosopher Baudrillard suggested, the flow of truth goes both ways.

us,Filmmakers Tread Gently on Authors Dystopia,"MARK ROMANEKS Never Let Me Go, which opens Wednesday, is the latest in the seemingly unstoppable, self-replicating tradition of films about cloning. It goes without saying that most of them look alike. But if youre unfamiliar with the book on which its based, Kazuo Ishiguros luminous novel of the same name, or if you want to be surprised this time by some unusual genetic modification, you might want to stop reading right here. Thats because this movie deviates from the standard Hollywood premise that clones are by definition evil, debased versions of their originals.

The trip caused him to cancel an appearance in Parliament, where he was expected to face questioning over the role of his communications director, Andy Coulson, in a cellphone hacking scandal. In a television interview this spring, Mr. Cameron said he had been inspired by his father, who, though born with a severe deformity in both legs that led eventually to their amputation, played competitive tennis as a youth and had a successful career as a stockbroker. My father is a huge hero figure for me, because hes an amazingly brave man, Mr. Cameron said.

The trip is a first for the organization, which has increasingly stressed the Cuban aspect of jazz, and was facilitated by the Cuban pianist Chucho Valds as part of a cultural exchange under the auspices of the Cuban Institute of Music, an agency of the Cuban Ministry of Culture. Mr. Valds, with his own band, already has New York concerts scheduled at Jazz at Lincoln Centers Allen Room on Oct. 22 and 23. We have been fantasizing about this for a long time, said Adrian Ellis, the organizations executive director, who noted that the Mellon, Ford, Rockefeller and two other smaller foundations came up with the money to pay for the trip once the band had secured approval from the United States government. The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, led by the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, above, will perform concerts of different kinds in Cuba Oct. 5-9, with large and small ensembles, as well as a Jazz for Young People performance.",2010-09-09T20:51:45+0000

Fox Searchlight described The Tree of Life as a chronicle of a Midwestern family in the 1950s and a son (who is played as an adult by Sean Penn) who is trying to resolve his relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Though the movie has been rumored as a possible entrant in several 2010 film festivals and even a late-breaking qualifier this year for the Academy Awards, Fox Searchlight said it would release The Tree of Life in 2011.

Our creative processes are similar and both very technical, Gillsays. It made sense since our work shares a sleekness combined with underlying hand-wrought elements. Contorting acrylic tubing around colorful enamel chords, Auerbach created a spiraling sculpture-like necklace and chose polished lucite and elastic bracelets. I wanted to use a lot of clear material so that I could make big pieces that wouldnt be too dominating, she says. I thought it would be interesting to see the clothes through the jewelry, and to make certain parts of the pieces like the elastic on the bracelets appear suspended in the air around the models wrists. I chose Lucite because it was durable and I could form it myself. Our hypothesis?

Mr. Daley is as complicated as the city he oversees. He is quick to anger, surprising, emotional; exceedingly loyal to some and ruthlessly business-like to others; parochial, yet overly sensitive when criticized for it. While he was in office, great strides were made. Mr. Daley oversaw a city that transformed its economy, making Chicago the vibrant hub of the Midwest. He remade the citys front yard with Millennium Park, and showcased the city with a victory celebration after helping a Chicagoan win the highest office in the land. And he was ready to show it off on a global stage with an ambitious bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. But there were also stunning setbacks. Moves like the middle-of-the-night takeover of Meigs Field solidified a reputation as a bully and autocrat. There was the humiliating Olympics loss  elimination in the first round of the International Olympic Committees voting process  and the privatization missteps. Recent high-profile crime in otherwise-stable neighborhoods undermined the good news of relatively lower crime rates. And now he leaves a financial mess for his successor. Most assuredly, Mr. Daleys success as mayor will be debated for years. What follows is a look at his legacy in five areas  politics, education, crime, race and business  that will most likely frame Chicagoans discussions about the eventful mayoralty of Richard M. Daley.

Wangs downtown gallerina was clad in sheer fabrics, optic white denim and wide-cut pants, paired with a no-look look that had beauty editors scratching their heads. There isnt really much makeup today, said Kendal with a wry grin. She bleached brows by applying Wella Wellite Powder Lightener with a makeup brush to keep the girls looking coolwith the exception of Agyness Deyn, who apparently wasnt up for a color change. And on the rest of the face? Just concealer where needed and moisturizer. We wanted the skin to look shiny. Over at the hair station, Palau said he didnt want hair color to stand out and get in the way of the identity of Wangs new-age traveler woman. To make the look uniform, he mixed Fullers Earth Claya cosmetic clay often used in DIY skincare recipes and that is also the main ingredient in popular 1940s hair powder Minipoowith white pigment and slicked the concoction through the hair. The resulting look was futuristic on models (including runway vets Karen Elson, Omahrya Mota and Karolina Kurkova), but in reality would look like someone in the middle of undergoing a double process (perhaps to emerge as the grey-haired woman seen earlier today at Cynthia Rowley). The nails, filed to a rounded shape, also appeared peculiarly half-done: manicurists applied one coat of Butter London Nail Foundation Flawless Basecoat followed by two coats of the brands Matte Finish Topcoat. The overall effect was certainly a look, and indeed, one best pulled off by a young art star, down to the late-breaking addition of faux rose gold septum rings.",2010-09-12T13:35:59+0000

It began to feel Pollyanna-like to tell them, Those are not nice words, or even, We dont curse, and my message instead became, We dont curse in certain situations. Like in front of your teachers. Or your grandmother (even though I now know she knows those words). Or at a job interview. And, as one who uses words for a living, I tried to stress that curses are lazy.

The board, the nonprofit organization that oversees the college entrance exam, emphasized the impact of a rigorous high school curriculum on student performance.

But the National Center for Fair & Open Testing, a critic of the SAT, noted a decline in overall scores since 2006, when the federal No Child Left Behind testing mandates went into effect.

Trained as a cabinetmaker, Rietveld  an early member of the de Stijl movement known for his Red-Blue Chair and Schrder House  suffered many such disappointments in a career of more than 45 years. But a new retrospective at Utrechts Centraal Museum illustrates how his groundbreaking ideas had a much broader impact than is generally acknowledged. In Holland you have this feeling that maybe he was a genius but he wasnt a good architect, says Ida van Zijl, the curator of Rietvelds Universe, which opens Oct. 20 as part of the Netherlands Rietveld Year. People dont realize how many works he made and how experimental they were. The exhibition puts his furniture and architecture on an international scale, comparing it with Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier and van der Rohe as well as showing its influence on contemporary designers. In a room dedicated to the Red-Blue Chair, the real thing will sit alongside a video of Maarten Baass charred homage. ",2010-09-14T13:00:06+0000

Last month the board indicated it planned to make the emergency regulations permanent, in part because a bill addressing the issue had stalled in the Legislature.

Baker, a former Goldman Sachs executive who oversaw the ill-fated and short-lived hiring of Gerard Mortier as general manager of the New York City Opera, is stepping down as the companys chairwoman, City Opera said Thursday. Her place will be taken on Dec. 16 by Charles R. Wall, a former tobacco company lawyer who served on the board from 2001 to 2008. In a brief statement that came with the announcement Ms. Baker gave no reason. A City Opera spokesman said Ms. Baker was not immediately available to comment. Ms. Baker, who has held the job for seven years, will remain on the board. She championed the hiring of Mr. Mortier, an iconoclastic Belgian opera impresario who also served as artistic director, after meeting him at a dinner. He joined the company in February 2007 but worked out an agreement under which he would continue to serve in his previous job of running the Paris National Opera. Mr. Mortier pushed for the renovation of City Operas Lincoln Center home, now the David H. Koch Theater, which was closed for the 2008-9 season. The closing contributed to a financial nightmare for the company, which only last season began a modest comeback. In November 2008 Mr. Mortier quit even before formally taking over, saying the budget he was handed fell far short of what he was promised.",2010-09-16T21:52:05+0000

Quinn, and executives from the Roundabout Theater Company, which operates the theater. Addressing a crowd of Broadway industry veterans and fans of his work, Mr. Sondheim explained the source of his embarrassment. Partly because Ive always hated my last name, he said. It just doesnt sing. After his speech Mr. Sondheim pulled a switch at the front of the stage, and an illuminated version of his signature flickered and came to life (without a still-missing dot in the letter i that has apparently gone into one of Mrs. Lovetts pies).",2010-09-16T21:53:27+0000

But circumstances might turn out better for Global Creatures, the Australian production company behind animatronic touring shows like Walking With Dinosaurs. It is aiming to bring a King Kong musical to Broadway as soon as 2013. Carmen Pavlovic, the chief executive of Global Creatures, said the project, which has been authorized by the estate of the King Kong co-director Merian C. Cooper, and whose creative team will include the director Daniel Kramer, the book writer Craig Lucas (Prelude to a Kiss) and the composer Marius de Vries (Baz Luhrmanns William Shakespeares Romeo + Juliet), will feature a robotic Kong (above) that can fit in the notoriously narrow wings of a Broadway theater. At heart the show will be a musical. King Kong doesnt suddenly grab a microphone and sing a song to Ann Darrow, I promise you, Ms. Pavlovic said. But if you think about the story and the character of Ann, and her background as a performer, and sailors on a ship, and Anns relationship with Kong, theres plenty of opportunities within the story itself, where music naturally fits.",2010-09-16T21:54:02+0000
us,Michael Jacksons Mother Sues Promoter Over His Death,"Michael Jacksons mother has filed a lawsuit against the promoter of his planned concerts last year, saying that the company, AEG Live, failed to supply medical equipment or to monitor his personal doctor properly, Reuters reported. In her suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday, Katherine Jackson seeks unspecified damages and says that the promoter is responsible for the actions and inactions of the doctor, Conrad Murray, and that it put its desire for massive profits over Jacksons health. AEGs representations to Jackson were false, the suit says, because in reality AEG was merely doing whatever it took to make sure that Michael Jackson could make it to rehearsals and shows, and AEG did not provide a doctor who was truly looking out for Jacksons well-being. A lawyer for AEG, Marvin S. Putnam, said in a statement that the lawsuit is inaccurate, unsubstantiated and meritless. On June 25, 2009, three weeks before he was to begin a series of 50 comeback shows in London, Jackson died from an overdose of powerful sedatives, and the Los Angeles medical examiner has ruled his death a homicide. Dr. Murray, who was not named in Katherine Jacksons suit, has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter in the death.",2010-09-16T21:54:35+0000

We enter the book strongly planted within these restrictions. We know only what Jack knows, and the drama is immediate, as is our sense of disorientation over why these characters are in this place.

She has created a structured, lively regimen for him, including exercise, singing and reading. The main objects in the room are given capital letters  Rug, Bed, Wall  a wonderful choice, because to Jack, they are named beings.

us,The Metafictional Club,"Before taking up a novel like Scarlett Thomass Our Tragic Universe, with its playful and portentous fixations on riddles, paradoxes and Zen koans, it may be helpful to engage in a few preliminary thought experiments. Is a seed placed in a pot and covered with dirt and water a flower? Is an assortment of bread, meat, cheese and condiments piled on a plate a sandwich? And is a sequence of fictional events, populated by characters and imbued with subtexts and recurring themes, a novel? In the abstract we cannot know, but in specific cases we should be able to answer conclusively. So how is it that this lively and thoughtful book possesses all the requisite elements of the thing it wants to be, and is so self-aware of what its components should be, yet lacks the essential spark that would make it a satisfying work of literature?",2010-09-17T16:33:46+0000

His subjects are sex, poetry, death, solitude, violent crime and the desperate glimmers of transcendence that sometimes attend them. The prose is dark, intimate and sneakily touching. His lens is largely (though not literally) autobiographical, and seems narrowly focused at first. There are no sweeping historical gestures in Bolao. Yet he has given us a subtle portrait of Latin America during the last quarter of the 20th century  a period of death squads, exile, disappeared citizens and state-sponsored terror.

us,New York Fashion Week | Emily Jerome,"Resort collections may be a passing thought as spring quickly engulfs the fashion-conscious, but that doesnt mean designers have all tired of wild cruise prints. Take the nascent Los Angeles designer Emily Jerome, whose Jerome label sells at Ron Herman, L.A., and is worn by Mamie Gummer, Jessica Collins and Catherine and Allison Pierce of the Pierces, among others. Not that you have to be a celebutante to wear it, but wallflowers need not apply. The Jerome girl is a little bit of everything  the rocker, bohemian and a tad flamboyant at times, Jerome said via phone while working on her first look book (shot by Eric Ray Davidson) at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Tex., with Jessica Joffe. If the backdrop and the artful multiculti prints look familiar, its because the estate belongs to Donald Judd, Jeromes godfather and a collector of ethnic textiles and African masks. My prints this season derive from Christmas tree worms and ancient, ritual shoulder clothes from Bhutan, Jerome said. You can take the girl out of Marfa. ",2010-09-17T20:16:13+0000

us,"Weekly Pick Em: Lacking in Marquee Value, Not Intrigue","At first glance, this Saturdays schedule seems like a comedown from last weeks. No Oklahoma-Florida State, no Ohio State-Miami, no Notre Dame-Michigan. In fact, there is only matchup between ranked teams this Saturday (No. 9 Iowa at No. 24 Arizona). But it would be remiss to think that the lack of marquee games means Saturday holds little intrigue. Several ranked teams will face serious early-season tests, some of them in hostile environments (just ask Texas Coach Mack Brown how much hes looking forward to going into Lubbock to play Texas Tech and its new coach, Tommy Tuberville). Eighth-ranked Nebraska will not only be up against Jake Locker, but it will have to contend with the always intimidating atmosphere in Washington. Florida State returns home after getting blown out at Oklahoma last week, but the Seminoles dont get much of a break when they host Brigham Young. Two A.C.C. teams, Georgia Tech and North Carolina, that have already seen their seasons go in a different direction than they wanted them to, play a game that is already critical for each. And Al Golden, the coach who has turned Temple around and is sure to be mentioned for some high-profile jobs at the end of the season, will see how his Owls fare against Connecticut of the Big East. What this weekend lacks in marquee value, it makes up for in intrigue. And that means that there is plenty of room for error when picking the games. As always, if you agree with the picks, disagree with them or simply find them laughable, feel free to chime in. ",2010-09-17T20:59:39+0000

us,Borat Star To Play Freddie Mercury,"Now that vrit-style comedies that try to present themselves as documentaries have been made totally pass, Sacha Baron Cohen has decided its time for a transition to the less controversial turf of the biopic. Mr. Baron Cohen, above left, the British comedian and star of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and Bruno, is planning to portray Freddie Mercury, above right, the frontman of the rock band Queen, who died in 1991, in a feature, the films producers said Thursday night. In a news release, the production company GK Films said it had signed Mr. Baron Cohen for an untitled drama focusing on the era surrounding Queens performance at the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert. The screenplay is by Peter Morgan, the Frost/Nixon playwright and writer of historical films like The Queen and The Last King of Scotland. The films producers, who also include TriBeCa Productions and Queen Films, did not indicate whether Mr. Baron Cohen would actually sing such demanding Queen songs as We Are the Champions or Bohemian Rhapsody. But he did get a chance to show off his throat  in more ways than one  in Tim Burtons film version of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Baker, who is ceding the job of chairwoman of the New York City Opera, said the move was just part of good governance and had nothing to do with the companys difficult chapter involving the 2008 resignation of its general manager Gerard Mortier. Heavens, no! she said late Thursday in a telephone interview. Ms. Baker was chairwoman during Mr. Mortiers hiring and quick resignation, which was widely viewed as a debacle in the opera world. Im a great believer in chairs not overstaying, Ms. Baker said. So I put in place a committee sometime over the course of the past year to really commence a process for finding a new leader. That new leader, as reported, will be Charles R. Wall, a former board member who recently retired as vice chairman of Philip Morris International. Ms. Baker said that she would stay active on the board, but that she and Mr. Wall still had to talk about her specific role. Ms. Baker declined to talk about the Mortier chapter.

us,Nicole Kidman To Return To Broadway Next Year,"The Academy Award-winning actress Nicole Kidman plans to return to Broadway in the fall of 2011 to star in a revival of the Tennessee Williams play Sweet Bird of Youth, to be directed by David Cromer (Our Town), a spokesman for the production said on Friday. Ms. Kidman, left, was last on Broadway, in her debut, in the 1998-99 season production of David Hares play The Blue Room. That show drew mixed reviews but was a very tough ticket to come by, given Ms. Kidmans star appeal. In Sweet Bird, Ms. Kidman will play Alexandra Del Lago, the faded, often-drunk movie star going around with the gigolo Chance Wayne; no word on who will play Chance. The original 1959 production on Broadway starred Geraldine Page as Alexandra and Paul Newman as Chance, who also starred in a film version; a 1975-76 revival, the last on Broadway, starred Irene Worth and Christopher Walken. Scott Rudin (last seasons Tony Award-winning Fences, the coming musical Book of Mormon) will be producing. The production and Ms. Kidmans casting were reported in The New York Post.",2010-09-17T23:40:56+0000
us,"Promises, Promises Will Close In January","One of Broadways biggest commercial hits of the year, the Sean Hayes-led revival of the musical Promises, Promises, will close on Jan. 2, the producers announced on Thursday night. The decision to close the show only nine months after opening is another reminder of the premium that producers put on star casting on Broadway  and the high costs and unpredictability of recasting. Beth Williams, one of the lead producers, said in a phone interview on Friday that the producers considered recasting, started putting lists together, but we didnt think there was a way to replace Sean and Kristin Chenoweth and ensure extending the shows financial track record as well. In a statement, the producers said they expected to recoup their original capitalization cost  they would not say how much it was, but it was at least in the high seven figures  and turn a profit for their investors, especially as the show heads into the lucrative holiday season. The show has grossed more than $25 million since opening in April. Its leading man and woman  Mr. Hayes (an Emmy Award winner for Will & Grace), above, and Ms. Chenoweth (Wicked, a Tony winner for Youre a Good Man, Charlie Brown)  are under contract only through the end of the year, and they were not re-upping. Katie Finneran, who won a Tony as Marge MacDougall, will pass on the role to Molly Shannon next month.

BBC America said Thursday that it would import Law & Order: UK beginning next month, with the premiere set for a Sunday, Oct. 3, at 10:30 p.m. Other episodes will be shown on Friday nights at 9. Law & Order: UK is the first foreign English-language iteration of the long-running crime series. It is produced by NBC Universal, Wolf Films and a British production company called Kudos Film and Television. The producers recycled scripts from the original Law & Order, set in New York, to retain the grittiness of that series, the BBC said. But the episodes were adapted to reflect the legal system in Britain. Dick Wolf, the executive producer of the Law & Order empire, told BBC News last year that legally, the biggest difference here was the wigs.

us,Palin the Front-Runner?,"According to a bipartisan chorus  right, center-right, and liberal  the victory of Christine ODonnell in Delawares primary proves that the race for the Republican nomination in 2012 is no longer wide open, because Sarah Palin is officially the front-runner. This strikes me as bunkum for many of the reasons that Ramesh Ponnuru and Daniel Larison discuss, and especially for this one: It is extremely unlikely that the political landscape in the winter and spring of 2012 will resemble the political landscape in the autumn of 2010. Even setting aside the unpredictability of economic developments, foreign-policy crises, and everything else that could shift the ground beneath our feet, the reality of having a more empowered Republican Party in Washington and a weaker President Obama in the White House will almost certainly work profound changes on the countrys mood  and yes, in the mood of the Republican base as well. (Its hard to be quite so fired up and furious about socialism when Washington is mired in gridlock, and its hard to be quite so outraged at RINO perfidy when youve kicked a lot of the RINOs out of office.) The temper of conservative politics in the fall of 1994, the off-year election cycle that most resembles this one (it was a year, as Rich Lowry notes, when a former homeless man defeated the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee), bore little resemblance to the temper of conservative politics in 1996, when Bob Dole cruised to the Republican nomination over more base-pleasing candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm. And while its likely that the Tea Parties will lend a greater resilience to the present anti-establishment spirit, 12-t0-18 months of divided government will almost certainly have a dampening effect on the impulses that carried Christine ODonnell to victory.",2010-09-18T14:38:37+0000

That society, founded in 1957 by the period-instrument pioneer Newell Jenkins, who died in 1996, has been revivified under Steven Fox, its artistic director since 2005.

The directors, evidently speaking for the full board, pointed to the Collegiums successes, but added, We nevertheless believe that the current economic environment will not support the sustainability of an independent Collegium.

us,Illinois: Congressman Denies Dealing for Senate Seat,"Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. on Tuesday denied a report that he told a fund-raiser to offer former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich campaign contributions in exchange for appointing Mr. Jackson to Barack Obamas Senate seat. The account appeared in The Chicago Sun-Times, which said the fund-raiser, Raghuveer Nayak, told the authorities that Mr. Jackson wanted Mr. Blagojevich to know that he would help him raise $6 million. The report also said that Mr. Nayak paid for two airline trips for a social acquaintance of Mr. Jacksons. Mr. Jackson did not appear to report the trips as a gift on financial disclosure forms, according to The Sun-Times. In a statement, Mr. Jackson said: The allegations about fund-raising and the Senate seat are not new. Ive already talked with the authorities about these claims, told them they were false, and no charges have been brought against me. The very idea of raising millions of dollars for a campaign other than my own is preposterous. He said the reference to a social acquaintance is a private and personal matter between me and my wife that was handled some time ago. ",2010-09-22T02:36:00+0000

My last request: Everything I leave behind me . . . in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others), sketches and so on, to be burned unread. Less than two months later, Brod, disregarding Kafkas request, signed an agreement to prepare a posthumous edition of Kafkas unpublished novels. The Trial came out in 1925, followed by The Castle (1926) and Amerika (1927). In 1939, carrying a suitcase stuffed with Kafkas papers, Brod set out for Palestine on the last train to leave Prague, five minutes before the Nazis closed the Czech border.

If I would give the truthful answer, he says, I would have to say that I really do not think in such categories between furniture and sculptures. His latest installation, Roman Room, at Gagosian Gallery in Rome, makes a practical distinction if not a conceptual one. A cluster of sculptures made largely from papier-mch, foam, gauze and cardboard, perched on low pedestals, intermingle with a pair of linen sheathed sofas and a chair that West created specially for the occasion. I had the idea while watching my 3-year-old son looking up at the sculptures, the artist says of the arrangement. The seatings make for alternative positions and viewing platforms throughout the show.The sculptures, which, depending on how you look at them and also maybe how old you are, might bring to mind enormous, melting ice cream treats, are as lumpy and charming as the seating is lean and angular. Both exude comfort in their own way. When I was younger, I thought it was all right to make the visitor uncomfortable, West says.

us,Busted,"Randy Britton e-mails: Ive noticed in much of the coverage of the BP oil spill that the press has taken to calling the oil well busted. Since when is busted the proper way to describe a broken oil well? It seems very colloquial and not a form I would expect to see in proper journalistic forums. Even now that BPs troubled oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is being permanently sealed, news reports continue to refer to the busted well, particularly wire services like the Associated Press and AFP. Reuters was an early adopter, reporting on efforts to contain the busted well on May 3. Alternatively, busted has modified oil rig, or just plain rig. A database search of coverage of the BP spill finds the first recorded use of busted came nine days into the crisis on April 29, when the MSNBC host Ed Schultz said, The busted rig is leaking  get this  200,000 gallons of oil a day. Is busted overly informal for journalists? The verb bust certainly has colloquial roots, beginning its life on the American scene as a folksy variant of burst. (The same dropping of the r turned curse into cuss, horse into hoss and parcel into passel.) Building on earlier use as a noun, bust busted out as a verb as early as 1806, when Meriwether Lewis, while on his famous expedition with William Clark, wrote in his journal, Windsor busted his rifle near the muzzle. Since then, bust has worked its way into a wide variety of American expressions.  Bust runs the gamut from slang to standard, explain David K. Barnhart and Allan A. Metcalf in their book America in So Many Words. When it is used to mean to explode or fall apart or be arrested, bust is generally slang. In the sense of failing (especially financially) it is informal, as busting the bank in gambling lingo, while in the specialized sense of taming a horse it is standard, the only way to say busting a bronco. Despite its potential slanginess, busted is not actually forbidden in the news media, as the Boston Globe language columnist Jan Freeman wrote in August. Indeed, reporters often latch onto the occasional colloquialism that seems particularly expressive, and in this case, Freeman surmises they were drawn to the terms criminal-cowboy-macho connotations. Regardless of the reasons for its current vogue, its notable that busted was rarely relied on by the press to describe stricken oil wells before the BP disaster  even in incidents that were highly similar, such as the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc I well in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the precursors I found come from more literary sources. It was appropriate, for instance, in some light verse by J.W. Foley published in The New York Times in 1904: Dear friend, theres a question Id like to ask you, (Your pardon I crave if it vexes) Have you ever invested a hundred or two In an oil well somewhere down in Texas? Have you ridden in autos (I mean in your mind), With the profits you honestly trusted Would flow from your venture in oil stocks  to find That the oil well was hopelessly busted?  I cant find fault in reporters drawing on the rich history of bust and busted in American English to add a little extra oomph to their dispatches from the gulf. Calling the well busted does evoke a looser, wilder state of disrepair than broken, or the more technically accurate blown-out. But after many months of news coverage, the phrase busted well has now turned into little more than a clich. Thats a far worse journalistic offense than a bit of well-placed slang.",2010-09-23T22:31:07+0000

The genre is noir, and it has its own argot (noir-got?). People dont divorce; they split the sheets.

According to Moyn, human rights in their current form  applicable to all and internationally protected  can be traced not to the Enlightenment, nor to the humanitarian impulses of the 19th century nor to the impact of the Holocaust after World War II.

The Tide has been dominant so far, and the return of Mark Ingram last week gives them even more firepower. This is the kind of game that makes coming out of the Southeastern Conference unscathed such a feat, as is South Carolinas matchup with Auburn. Notre Dame has hit some bumps already in Brian Kellys first season as coach and it doesnt get any easier this weekend, with No. 16 Stanford coming to South Bend. Andrew Luck has been spectacular for the Cardinal so far, and a big game against the Irish could give him a lot of confidence heading into the rest of the Pac-10 schedule. West Virginia and Louisiana State are both undefeated, but have still managed to seem somewhat suspect. Will the Mountaineers be able to overcome the hostile environment they are sure to be greeted with in Baton Rouge? But perhaps the weekends most intriguing game is Oregon State traveling to Boise State, where it will face the Broncos on the Smurf Turf. Boise State needs a convincing win to answer some of the critics now downplaying its victory over Virginia Tech. Of course, the Beavers have knocked off top teams before (just ask U.S.C.).

Oliver Stones Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, with Michael Douglas, below, reprising his Oscar-winning role as the financial miscreant Gekko, sold about $19 million in tickets for first place at North American theaters over the weekend. Twentieth Century Fox, which spent an estimated $60 million to make the picture, said that 65 percent of the audience was over 30. I think that bodes well because what we know about adult audiences is that they dont rush out, but they do keep coming, said Chris Aronson, Foxs senior vice president for domestic distribution. The other major release of the weekend, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole, finished second, selling about $16.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. That total was weak considering that Guardians, which Warner Brothers spent about $80 million to make, had premium-priced 3-D tickets to help prop it up. Ben Afflecks Town (Warner Brothers) was a close third with $16 million  demonstrating impressive hold in its second weekend  for a new total of more than $49 million. The comedy Easy A (Sony Pictures Entertainment) was fourth with $10.7 million ($32.8 million total).

The announcement came after a mediation session on Friday failed to produce any progress. The orchestra has been sustaining huge financial losses, mainly because of declines in ticket sales and donations; the players also blame bad decision-making. The administration, saying that major cuts are necessary for survival, is seeking to reduce the players base salary by 33 percent, and by 42 percent for incoming players. The musicians are offering a 22 percent reduction in the first year for both categories. (The base salary is $104,650.) The orchestras executives also want to loosen work rules so the musicians can be given other assignments, like coaching, teaching and playing chamber concerts.

He and the $6.5 million cap hit he represents are now clear to go to the Rangers American League affiliate in Hartford. The long-anticipated move puts the Rangers beneath the salary cap and even leaves them with a couple of million dollars to make a new signing. But some believe that sending Redden to the minors (or to Europe, where he could sign with a club as former Blackhawks goalie Cristobal Huet did last month) could prove problematic under the collective bargaining agreement. Redden, a former N.H.L. all-star with Ottawa who once shared the leagues plus-minus award and played for Team Canada at the World Cup, I.I.H.F. World Championship and Winter Olympics, scored 5 goals and 40 points while going plus-3 in 156 games with the Rangers. Those stats are pretty good, but far short of the performance expected from a player who still has four years and $23 million left on his current Rangers deal. Redden does have a third option if he clears waivers: refuse to report to Hartford, which would void his contract and leave him free to seek a deal with another N.H.L. team, which will undoubtedly pay him much less.",2010-09-27T15:57:05+0000

But when artists create furniture, even the pretense of functionality disappears, leading to weird works like homoerotic bunk beds and chandeliers, like the one by Lee Bul (below), that dont light up. These are the kinds of conceptually charged objects cataloged in The New Dcor, the book based on a recent exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London and traveling to the Garage in Moscow this month. Their purpose is not to elevate the trappings of domestic life but to question our very faith in them. Contemporary artists are associating the home with a sense of movement, insecurity and precariousness, says the Haywards director, Ralph Rugoff. Rather than being a castle, home is a vulnerable place now. While the more absurd pieces  like a giant hot-pink papier-mch phallus bench by Franz West  explore our private space as a kind of public theater, others are more obviously unsettling. The Swiss artist Fabrice Gygis tented writing desk is somewhere between a childs fort and a bomb shelter, and Jin Shis Chinese migrant workers dwelling is a chilling reminder of how the other half lives.

For the Sabres its the first of several keynote events in this, their 40th anniversary season. On Nov. 6 they will go to Toronto to play the Leafs, their neighbors and historic rivals, in the Hall of Fame game, and from Dec. 26 to Jan. 5 their downtown rink will play host to the world junior tournament. Back to the Hamilton area, where there are a fair number of Sabres season-ticket holders. Still, its slightly odd that the Sabres annus mirabilis should start near Hamilton, as their presence just 50 miles down the Queen E. Way is one of two reasons Hamilton cannot get an N.H.L. team (the other reason, of course, is the presence of the Leafs less than 50 miles the other way).",2010-09-28T15:16:01+0000

The decision, by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, overturns laws prohibiting the keeping of a bawdy house, communicating for the purposes of prostitution and living on the avails of the trade. The constitutional challenge was brought by two prostitutes and a dominatrix who was convicted under the bawdy-house law for running what she called the Bondage Bungalow.

Meanwhile, auction prices for vintage Ponti pieces have been on a winning streak, not unlike the thoroughbred racehorse named after him. Now The Expression of Gio Ponti, curated by Germano Celant, gives the designer his biggest local showcase since the days of the old Alitalia ticket offices he created at 666 Fifth Avenue. The whopping retrospective, which opens in early 2011 and is the first exhibition at the brand-new Triennale di Milano design museum in Midtown, includes 250 items, from drawings to majolica to furniture, including the iconic Superleggera chair, which Ponti called, with characteristic flair, the chair for all times.

(This ends up excluding the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh, who would otherwise provide some of his stiffest competition, as well as some recent bloomers like Jason Reitman.) Using that time frame, Fincher is up against Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Peter Jackson, Christopher Nolan, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Alexander Payne, Spike Jonze, Danny Boyle, Ang Lee, and no doubt some others Im forgetting. Many of the directors on that list have made individual movies that might be better than a given Fincher film.

His new novel, Fall of Giants, is the first volume of a projected trilogy in which the 20th century has replaced the Middle Ages as a stage for lifes grandeurs and miseries, but the books narrative structure is the same: multiple plot strands woven through a vast tapestry of times past. In this huge panorama, empires rise and fall, wars break out and characters of varying social backgrounds live mostly happy or mostly unhappy lives  mostly happy, more often than not, because Follett is an optimist, and firmly on the side of the good guys. He prefers to save historys horrors for the villains, who are frequently humiliated in satisfying ways. ",2010-09-30T21:51:15+0000

The issue, which consisted largely of contributions from native Indians writing in English, was a testament both to the countrys extraordinary intellectual and artistic richness, and to one of the few legacies of British colonialism that could be unequivocally celebrated by readers in South Asia and the West: a common language.

It had been inculcated in her from birth that the Soviet Union, through great heroism and sacrifice, had rescued the nation and the civilized world from the scourge of fascism. Victory in the Great Patriotic War was the one unquestioned achievement of the Soviet state, endlessly glorified in art, song, film and monuments. Stalins crimes, by contrast, had been pushed into the deep background after Nikita Khrushchev fell from power in 1964, and there they remained, off limits to the public and concealed behind euphemisms like mistakes or cult of personality, for the duration of Leonid Brezhnevs bland rule.
