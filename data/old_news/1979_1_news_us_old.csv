us,Film:Saga From Japan:In Political Milieu,"""MY Love Has Been Burning,"" the English translation of the Japanese title of the 1949 Kenji Mizoguchi film, must rank with ""The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice"" as the English-translated Japanese title least likely to mean anything whatsoever to Western minds. Yet the film, which has its New York theatrical premiere today at the Cinema Studio 2, is one to which attention must be paid, being, as it is, a product of that director's last great productive period, from 1946 until his death in 1956, when he turned out such works as ""Utamaro and His Five Women,"" ""A Geisha,"" ""Ugetsu"" and ""Sansho the Bailiff.""""My Love Has Been Burning"" is not the equal of those masterpieces, if only because its politics confuse its passions, at least to someone not familiar with modern Japanese history. Though one of Mizoguchi's principles was always to identify the society in which his characters functioned, the milieu of ""My Love Has Been Burning"" effectively obscures the film's major concerns until the movie is halfway through.The time is 1884, when Japan was moving erratically toward a form of democratic government. The film is basically the story of two young women, friends from childhood, and their different responses to a revolution that changed everything in their world except the status of women. Eiko is a well-born provincial who runs away to Tokyo to give her hopes, pride and virtue to the radical Liberal Party. Chiyo, the daughter of the servants in Eiko's house, is sold into servitude by her father. Though Eiko is serious, dedicated, firm of purpose and not very attractive, and Chiyo is silly, willful and pretty, they both suffer equally at the hands of men, even those who pledge themselves publicly to women's liberation  and behave like shoguns at home. Eiko is first betrayed by her childhood sweetheart, who pretends to be dedicated to the liberal cause but is actually a government spy, and then by her husband, Omoi, the head of the Liberal Party, who takes Chiyo as his mistress, a half-lot that is accepted by Chiyo until her consciousness is raised.The screenplay by Yoshikata Yoda, Mizoguchi's long-time screenwriter, and Kaneto Noda spends so much time establishing the political scene that it appears to discover the film's center  the relationship between these two very different women  only by accident. This, of course, is not true. Mizoguchi and his collaborators knew what they were up to from the start, though we don't. The early scenes, some hauntingly beautiful, are essential, but they have no life of their own, nor does the film, until Mizoguchi fixes his attention on the personal stories of Eiko and Chiyo.When the two women wind up in the same prison  Eiko for subversive political activities, Chiyo for setting fire to the mill where she works, an act of personal pique that, to her fury, is regarded as political sabotage, ""My Love Has Been Burning"" becomes a vivid, tumultuous emotional drama, Zolaesque in the way it details the horrors of the new industrial society.Kinuyo Tanaka is splendid in what at first appears to be the thankless role of the suffering Eiko. Her small, stumpy figure and purity of heart are not initially endearing, but as the performance progresses, she becomes transformed. She never becomes exactly beautiful, though there is real beauty in her intelligence and unheroic fortitude. Mitsuko Mito is lovely as the frivolous Chiyo, even if her final reconciliation with Eiko seems to be less a revelation of character than a convenience of the film.""My Love Has Been Burning"" lacks the cool grandeur of Mizoguchi's greatest films, which may be because it seems filled with the sort of close-ups he usually used so sparingly. It's not the film one should see as an introduction to Mizoguchi, but it's a must for anyone remotely interested in the career of one of the great directors of the sound era.",1979-01-05T05:00:00+0000

In 1932, when there was a great deal of explaining to be done about an art form that was still in its initial stages development, John Martin, dance critic of The Times, offered a most cogent definition. The modern dance is not system, he declared, It is a point of view. He was, course, telling us that modern dance was not classical ballet. Modern dance, he said, did not rely upon a codified movement idiom. Its own idiom was a new language that embodied the personal expression of its various choreographers. These points of view made up a collective point view toward dance in general.",1979-01-07T05:00:00+0000

The movement has fallen on hard times. Iraq's recent reconciliation with Syria scuttled what was left of the Kurdish struggle achieve autonomy in north Iraq. Syria agreed end assistance to Jalal Talabani, who was once top aide to the Kurdish chieftain, Mustafa Barzani, and fled to Syria after the Barzani insurrection collapsed in 1975. That revolt died when the Shah of Iran ended his aid to the rebels. The Shah later allowed the Kurdish chieftain, now SO, to go Washington. There, according to Middle Eastern political gossip, he is being kept on ice by the Cen- tral Intelligence Agency.

After a long period of disfavor some of those ponderous evocations are now being rediscovered and held up to admiration; and as for the subject matter, it is as evocative as ever it was. The Shield of Achilles by W.H.

us,Laura Antonelli Is Star Of 'Wifemistress' Film:The Cast,"If ""Wifemistress,"" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, is going to be popular, which I think may be the case, then let's hope it's a hit for the right reasons. The guiding force behind this movie is what might be called Frederick's of Hollywood Feminism, and it allows for scenes like the one in which spectacularly buxom Laura Antonelli, clad in a filmy negligee that has just about fallen off, picks up a pamphlet entitled ""The Emancipation of Women"" and knots her pretty brow, as if she were thinking. Maybe she is. Maybe you will be, too. Neither one of you will be thinking about the emancipation of women, that's for sure.It's too bad movies like this, or last year's ""Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,"" bother to masquerade as anything other than the soft-core porn they essentially are (although each of them is something of a travelogue, too). ""Wifemistress"" sustains an elaborate plot, and every now and then a political point rears its gratuitous head. But every situation boils down to somebody's making eyes at Miss Antonelli. And the only elements of suspense involve the matters of when (midway through the story), whether (of course) and how graphically (not very) she will begin to make eyes back.As the film begins, Miss Antonelli is a turn-of-the-century Italian heiress confined to her doll-filled bedroom while her husband, played by Marcello Mastroianni, goes philandering all over the very scenic countryside. The wife, called Antonia, is lonely and neglected, her only companion a buxom young woman who parades around in a boyish haircut and a fetching camisole. For reasons that are not explained but have a certain steamy logic of their own, this young woman secretly fools around with Antonia's husband and also sleeps peaceably in Antonia's bed.But then the husband has to go into hiding, because he is wrongly suspected of murder, and by the same steamy logic he finds a room that looks directly into Antonia's bedroom. Antonia is not in her bedroom, at least not for a while  being liberated from her husband's oppressive ways has restored her health, and sent her off to run his business and find out about his hobbies. He was a wine dealer, so Antonia must visit inns and drink. He was a rake, so Antonia must visit bordellos and find out what he did there. In the interests of accuracy, she must even do a bit of it herself.But he also wrote political pamphlets, and that's what's supposed to make this a movie with a message. Antonia does, after all, begin running her husband's business. She does discover that her husband wrote tracts about women's suffrage and atheism, even if their contents are never discussed. She does meet other liberated women, even if they do make passes at her. She does eventually become what her husband calls ""a complete woman,"" even if the term seems to pertain exclusively to her frigidity and the curing of same.Is there any point to this kind of pretension? Well, it may attract an audience that feels more comfortable with monkey business if it's disguised as serious business. But all this prurient dissembling has a way of getting on one's nerves, as do the movie's numbingly repetitive string score and its stubborn refusal to come to a prompt conclusion.Watching Miss Antonelli run through her coy paces is by no means uninteresting. But watching Mr. Mastroianni is surprisingly unrewarding, because he spends virtually all of the movie cooped up in an attic room, looking sad. Occasionally, Mr. Mastroianni peers out his window into Miss Antonelli's window and glimpses something that makes him genuinely distressed. The director, Marco Vicario, is aptly named.",1979-01-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Woman Finds Ego:Forced Liberation,"""LA FEMME DE JEAN"" (""John's Wife""), the second feature by Yannick Bellon, a new French film director whose work is being showcased this week at Joseph Papp's Public Theater, has been correctly described as a Gallic ""An Unmarried Woman,"" though Miss Bellon's film was actually made in 1974, before the release of the Paul Mazursky picture.Like the American film, ""La Femme de Jean"" is about a beautiful, intelligent, resourceful, upper-middle-class woman coping with sudden loneliness and loss of ego after her weak, foolish, unreliable, childish, aging husband walks out on her for another woman.The parallels don't stop there. Nadine, the abandoned Parisian wife, is beautifully played by France Lambiotte  a publicity woman whose first film role this is  and though she mopes around and cries a lot at the beginning, it's not long before she attracts the attentions of a man who's not only younger than her husband, but also far more interesting, more attentive, franker, sexier and more sure of himself.""La Femme de Jean,"" like ""An Unmarried Woman,"" stacks the cards in favor of the heroine who has been liberated in spite of herself. At this point, it might be interesting to see a movie in which (1) the husband isn't such an obvious bad investment and (2) the heroine isn't saved by the director-writer's romantic temperament.On the basis of this film, Miss Bellon is a competent director though not a very surprising one. She has a numbing fondness for beginning scenes by panning her camera horizontally to discover the scene's real subject, for closeups that don't emphasize a point as often as they ask for pity and for overlapping sounds that sometimes make one think the projectionist has mixed up the reels. However, Miss Lambiotte, her star, is a real find. The other performances are adequate.""La Femme de Jean"" will be screened at the Public Theater today, Thursday and Saturday. Miss Bellon's ""Somewhere Someone,"" her second feature, will be shown tomorrow and Sunday, and her ""Never More, Always,"" on Friday.",1979-01-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Tattooed Tears':Musicians Union to Honor Shubert Organization Head,"LIKE all good documentaries, ""Tattooed Tears"" touches on a number of subjects beyond its immediate view, which is of life at the Youth Training School in California, a correctional institution for men who are still young in years (17-21) but who already seem exhausted. The film, which opens today at the Whitney Museum of American Art, was produced, directed, photographed and edited by Nick Broomfield and Joan Churchill. It's a superior work in its field.""Tattooed Tears,"" a reference to the homemade tattoos with which one young prisoner has decorated his face (one tear for each year at the school), opens with the statement of a former director of the California Youth Authority to the effect that rehabilitation in such institutions is impossible and that their only purpose is to protect the people outside.The film goes on to show not only the physical and emotional tensions that are integral to life even in a comparatively well-run prison, but also the particular stories of four inmates, including an apparent schizophrenic. Only one of the four, a young black man named Brian, can articulate his frustrations, and he seems to be on the edge of total despair, having entered the school with a three-month sentence and seen that sentence grow to three years because of penalties for various minor infractions.A third young man, the tattoo artist, copes with his fate by refusing all cooperation, and a fourth, a fellow who displays the disconnected elation of a speed freak, attempts suicide and, when the opportunity arises again, severely slashes his leg. This, he explains, is one way of creating a little excitement when you're in solitary.The stories are infinitely sad, but even sadder are the implications that a second-rate society, doing its level best, not only will never solve these problems but also can't even alleviate them. The counselors and therapists we see in the film appear to be decent, conscientious, hard-working people, yet the manner in which they've been educated and trained makes it seem most unlikely they will ever do much good. Because they talk in the jargon and clichs of their trade, they seem almost as far removed from reality as the young men they are supposed to help.In one hilarious and frightening sequence, a school counselor attempts to convince his young listeners of the joys of American capitalism, as opposed to the miseries of Soviet Communism. He talks about sirloin steaks, freedom to travel and the ever-present possibility of making a million dollarsby legitimate means, of course. The audience remains skeptical. As this film demonstrates, Americans these days are talking more and more and saying less and less.",1979-01-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Visconti's 'The Innocent,' an Elegant Finale:Passions Rule","THOUGH it's sometimes difficult to associate the neo-realism of Luchino Visconti's early films, especially ""Ossessione"" and ""La Terra Trema,"" with the operatic indulgences of ""The Damned,"" ""Ludwig"" and ""Death in Venice,"" the connections are there  and not simply in the visual elegance of all his work. The more profound connections are in the passions that rule Visconti's principal characters, whether a lusty, sex-starved mistress of a roadside inn, a Sicilian aristocrat at the time of Italy's unification, or an upper-class Roman wife who manages to betray her philendering husband in a way that confers on him an unbearable innocence.This last is more or less the heart of ""The Innocent,"" Visconti's last film (completed in 1976 shortly before his death) and among the most beautiful and severely disciplined films he has ever made. It goes a long way toward erasing the memory of ""Conversation Piece,"" that curiously (sometimes ludicrously) awkward talk-film that opened the 1975 New York Film Festival and seemed emotionally charged to some Visconti admirers, who saw it as an old man's summing up.""The Innocent,"" based on Gabriele D'Annunzio's 1892 novel (published in this country in 1898 as ""The Intruder""), which I haven't read, may well keep to the spirit if not the letter of the original, as Visconti said some time before his death. More importantly, it exemplifies Visconti's social concerns, though in terms of a story so limited in its field of vision and so precise in its details that it comes as something of a shock when, at the conclusion, one realizes the real magnitude of the work.The turn-of-the-century world of ""The Innocent,"" though small, is no microcosm. It is exactly what it seems to be, a world of fashionable drawing rooms, music rooms and bedrooms in ancient Roman palaces and immaculately tended country villas, where incomes are enormous but invisible, and where affairs of the heart have almost nothing to do with the soul and everything to do with the body.Tullio (Giancarlo Giannini) is a perfect specimen of his time and place. He is rich, handsome, arrogant, self-confident and cruel, with a beautiful wife Giuliana (Laura Antonelli) whom he once loved and now fondles as a sister, which allows him the freedom to pursue his equally beautiful mistress, Teresa (Jennifer O'Neill), a widowed countess who is quite as self-absorbed as he.Though Tullio fancies himself a realist, completely in charge of his emotions, he is struck with a suddenly renewed, totally baffling (to him) love for his wife when he learns she has been having an affair with a young novelist. This new love is different from all the others he has experienced. It may even be real. Magnanimously he offers to overlook Giuliana's indiscretion until he learns that she is pregnant with the novelist's child.Though the novelist conveniently dies, Tullio tries unsuccessfully to persuade Giuliana to agree to an abortion. She refuses to go against church law, which infuriates Tullio, who thinks of himself as an atheist. ""The earth is the only country I belong to,"" he says. ""When I die, that's the end of it. I live now."" In the most sunny, civilized, well-ordered and well-mannered of worlds, the lives of Tullio and Giuliana are wrecked by their passions, as fatally as if they'd gone down with a luxury yacht in the middle of the Adriatic.""The Innocent"" has a surprising kind of narrative balance, a shapeliness that is not characteristic of Visconti though it serves to implement his larger concerns with the individual in his own society. In ""The Innocent"" these concerns are reflected in major scenes as well as in the most seemingly casual images, such as a series of shots of the guests at a piano recital sitting in the manner of beings frozen in time. Even the women's costumes, with their wasp waists, their veils and their parasols, suggest psychological constraints  bonds that eventually snap in the series of revelations that concludes the film.Although ""The Innocent"" is one of Visconti's most beautiful films, the dcor is essential to its meaning. ""The Innocent"" is also one of Visconti's most terse, most dramatically economical films. There's not a superfluous frame in it. Further, it is splendidly performed by Mr. Giannini, who indulges none of the comic mannerisms that are standard equipment in his work for Lina Wertmuller, and by Miss Antonelli, whose childlike face and voluptuous body combine to form a kind of ideograph that tells us what the film is all about.It is difficult to judge Miss O'Neill's performance. She looks great but her Italian dialogue has been dubbed, sometimes none too carefully, though for that matter all of the dialogue sounds post-synchronized.""The Innocent,"" which opens today at the Gemini II Theater, is a fitting coda to the Visconti career. It's a film of effortless command in which the director's presence is everywhere felt  and nowhere intrudes.",1979-01-12T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Sidlin, who agrees with Mahler's assessment of himself as a genius, attributes the cornposer's rise and popularity to the acceptance of hlm as the grandest of the Romantics; Mahler took the symphonic form to its extremes in length and variety. He said his day would come and it has. Mr. Sidlin believes Mahler was spurred by the conflicts within himself as both a Catholic and a Jew, and by the artistic and intellectual conflicts of his day, in which Schoenberg, Debussy and Richard Strauss walked the earth at the same time as Freud, in Sidlin's words. Maureen Forrester will be the contralto soloist when Mr.  Sidlin conducts Mahler's Kindertotenlieder at Woolsey Hall in New Haven Tuesday at 8:30 P.M. Mahler's Third Symphony takes up the rest of the program. The morose quality of the songs for dead infants is turned around in the Third Symphony, said Mr. Sidlin.

Now, with new figures that show a steeper sales decline, brewers are acknowledging that the problem isn't the rainfall in Bavaria but what seems to be an irreversible change in German life style. West Germany is still the world's largest per capita beer consumer and the world's leading exporter, but its citizens are ever more counting calories and tipping toward wine. After 25 consecutive years of golden growth, the brewery business has been transformed into a nervous, pessimistic and contracting industry.",1979-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Pol Pot's brave words about people's war until final victory for eternity if necessary  depend on forces that seem irrevocably beyond his control: the willingness, and the ability, of a significant number of Cambodians to continue fighting against the Vietnamese Army and Cambodian forces trained and supplied by Vietnam. No doubt the most fanatical Khmer Rouge soldiers, and those Cambodians who deem Vietnam the greatest of all evils, are prepared to fight on.

Producer prices at the finished goods level measure what used to be called wholesale prices, and presage consumer price movements. Gasoline prices were singled out as the largest factor in the December increase, rising 4 percent after adjustment for seasonal factors. Food prices, which had fueled most of the earlier increases, rose at about the same level as the overall index. ... According to the depart- ment, retail sales in 1978 climbed 10 percent - about the same as the rate of inflation. December's gain was 1 per- cent, a mild disappointment to those who looked to Christmas buying to spark a stronger showing. In fact, de- partment stores recorded a moderate 2 percent gain in sales for the month and a 4 percent increase from the year- earlier period. ... Businesses plan to increase outlays for new plant and equipment at an inflationadjusted an- nual rate of 3 percent in 1979 - a set- back for the Carter Administration, which has said that a 7 to 9 percent in- crease would benefit the economy.

And according to Orson Welles, who narrates most of ""The Late Great Planet Earth,"" Armageddon may just possibly be right around the corner. As Mr. Welles explains it, with a wordiness meant to give us all a good scare, man is besieged by ""perils that threaten to send him into the dark abyss of silence known as extinction.""What are these perils? You name it, and it's howling right outside the door. Atomic holocausts. Earthquakes. Floods. Famine. Killer bees. According to the film, the Bible cites every one of these things as part of the beginning of the end. You have to read between the lines, perhaps, but the movie is willing and eager to help you out on that score.So the list of prophesied ills is expanded to include environmental pollution, a military crisis in the Middle East, transcendental meditation and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. A number of scientists, many of them quite distinguished, are interviewed. They all agree that our prospects aren't good.The efficacy of the film's scare tactics is minimized by its applying biblical predictions too generally, and almost cavalierly at times  the most memorable sequence shows a computer conducting a numerological analysis of various politicians' names, to figure out if Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan or Ted Kennedy is the Antichrist. And Hal Lindsey, who co-wrote the book upon which the film is based and who appears with Mr. Welles as a co-narrator, speaks coolly, almost enthusiastically, about the prospect of worldwide destruction.Robert Amram, the director, begins the film with some brief dramatizations of biblical prophets, wearing cotton-candy beards and too much gray makeup as they purvey the bad news. The rest of the time, Mr. Amram uses stock footage of tanks, mushroom clouds, missiles being launched, troops marching, and Hollywood extras armed for battle in ancient Rome. His illustrations are no more convincing nor frightening than his grim but sketchy hypothesis.""The Late Great Planet Earth,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains moderately gruesome newsreel shots of war being waged, and one brief scene featuring the Whore of Babylon.",1979-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Servant to employer: ""Oh, I couldn't help it! This terrible business of the man who steals brains, sir!"" As if that weren't bad enough, the brain thief is busy turning the brains' former owners into raccoon-eyed zombies who will follow his every command. And the mad doctor is in cahoots with Shadowman, who has the mind of an archdemon and the funny-looking hooded jumpsuit of a cartoon character.Mr. Franju, best known for the 1960 ""Eyes Without a Face"" (also known as ""The Horror Chamber of Doctor Faustus""), is not kindly represented by ""Shadowman""  the dubbing from French into English calls constant attention to itself, and the color photography is often flat and grainy.But ""Shadowman"" has its quirky merits just the same, even if they're likely to be best appreciated by horror buffs or admirers of Mr. Franju's earlier work. There's a winning lightheartedness in the conception of Shadowman, a creature of vile tactics and many disguises who battles good guys even loonier than he is.The film moves quickly and episodically, with a lot of energy but not much logic, sandwiching effectively Spooky sequences with bland, time-wasting ones. One elaborate, prettily choreographed interlude features Gayle Hunnicutt, as Shadowman's glamorous but subverbal partner in crime, creeping across rooftops, cat-burglar style. Another memorable moment shows Shadowman's troops marching down a hallway en masse, wearing shabby Army overcoats and identical, expressionless face-masks. Their combined blankness and single-mindness are terrifying, even though not much else in ""Shadowman"" exhibits this degree of wit, or provides this much of a scare.""Shadowman,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains several violent murder scenes.",1979-01-18T05:00:00+0000

A young, very tough martial-arts warrior  we know he's tough because be sleeps sitting up  goes off in search of a book that contains all knowledge. Before he finds the book he finds David Carradine four times, in four different disguises. Each time Mr. Carradine appears, there is a great deal of whooshing and kicking on the screen.The young fighter, played with too much hearty ha-ha-haing by Jeff Cooper, learns a lot of solemn lessons on his journey, none of which ought to be unfamiliar to fortune-cookie connoisseurs. (Seekers take note: ""You can't step twice on the same piece of water."") But the ultimate point of his quest is pretty well nonexistent, and the movie's stabs at wisdom are dopey enough to undermine its action sequences. Even after his pilgrimage is over, Mr. Cooper has a long way to go.Roddy McDowall and Christopher Lee both appear in small roles and preposterously ill-fitting headpieces. Eli Wallach wins the film's What's a Nice Guy Like You Doing in a Place Like This? award by turning up in a vat of oil, in which he has supposedly been soaking for 10 years, hoping to get rid of his genitals. He explains this in a mercifully brief speech that doesn't bear repeating.The movie so evidently comes to life when Mr. Carradine is on the screen, and so emphatically falls apart without him, that one can't help regretting his choice to do most of his acting with his feet these days. ""Bound For Giory"" notwithstanding, Mr. Carradine has devoted most of his recent movie appearances to either driving fast cars or pulverizing martial-arts rivals. Even in roles that don't begin to utilize his full talents, his delivery is effortlessly wry, and he's able to make lines not even marginally intelligent sound wise.""Circle of Iron,"" which is dedicated to the memory of Bruce Lee, is derived from a story initially written by Mr. Lee and James Coburn (with help from Stirling Silliphant), about a young warrior and an older, all-knowing martial-arts seer.

us,"'Max Havelaar,' a Dutch Film About the Evils of Colonizing:The Cast","""Max Havelaar,"" the Dutch film that is competing for this year's Oscar as best foreign-language film, is an exceedingly long, sincere, elaborately produced contradiction in terms. It's a movie that exposes the evils of 19th-century Dutch colonialism in terms that are so naive and romantic that the audience will always be ahead of it even while taking in the exotic flora and fauna of Indonesia, where much of the film was shot. It's as if the Hardy Boys had dipped into the works of Frantz Fanon and decided that now was the time to grant independence to Algeria. The movie's heart is in the right place, but its mind is muddled.The film, which opens today at the Plaza Theater, is the work of Fons Rademakers, one of the more prominent directors in the Netherlands. It's based on a 19th-century novel by Multatuli, the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker, a Dutch civil servant who became his nation's Harriet Beecher Stowe, fictionalizing his experiences on behalf of justice for the wretched of the Dutch colonized earth in the East Indies.The title character, played by Peter Faber with the uncomplicated vigor one associates with old-fashioned costume pictures, believes himself to be a man with a mission to reform Dutch colonial rule in Java. He's the sort of fellow who doesn't hesitate to dive into shark-infested waters to save his son's small dog or to intervene when some gross white settlers are verbally abusing a pretty Javanese girl. One has the feeling that Max would help an old lady to cross a street even if she didn't want to go, though the movie makes nothing of the vanity that is integral to his obsession.When Max is posted to the poor Javanese province of Lebak, he attempts to expose the corruption of the native regent only to earn the enmity of his superiors in the civil service and of the regent. Ultimately it isn't the regent who gets bounced, but Max.The physical scale of ""Max Havelaar"" is so big that it almost invests the film's essential clumsiness with the properties of myth. At its best moments, which are very few, the movie has a kind of fairy-tale simplicity. Occasionally it aspires to a sophistication that seems completely out of character, as in one scene in which Max confounds his dinner guests with a definition of beauty that seems beyond the comprehension of the man we know.Contradictions of all sorts sap the movie's credibility. Mr. Rademakers frames the narrative with heavily ironic shots of righteous, well-fed Dutch burghers singing for the salvation of their colonial subjects, but ends his film with a montage showing Dutch soldiers putting down rebellion in a manner that seems meant to recall My Lai. Because the Netherlands did not give up its East Indian colonies until after World War II, one must wonder how the locals survived until then.Must peculiar is the film's introduction, early on, of the titles of some of the works that Max Havelaar wrote (""Marriage as Prostitution,"" ""Slavery in Europe""), which suggest that he might have a mind much more interesting and complex than is demonstrated by the film itself.Though ""Max Havelaar"" now runs close to three hours, one suspects that some helpful footage has been cut. Either that or Dutch viewers know the story well enough to fill in what seem to be gaps to us. To someone coming on the film cold, ""Max Havelaar"" is a very mixed pleasure, Its most interesting aspect is the color photography of Jan De Bont, which, in certain sequences, recalls the muted tones that John Huston sought in his ""Moby Dick"" by (if I remember correctly) printing a black-and-white negative over the color negative. The purpose was to create the effect of a sort of liberated sepia  that is, a sepia in which other colors supplement the sepia tones. Whatever the method, the results are sometimes very beautiful.",1979-01-21T05:00:00+0000

But when I woke up, I was full of thrills, he was saying now. Don't ask me what kind of thrills but they were there. He was standing behind a lectern on the stage of the Imperial Ballroom of the Americana Hotel yesterday, wearing a bright blue plaid suit, a blue shirt and an orange tie surely the colors were significant. Blue and orange are the colors of the Mets, his last team. Orange is also one of the colors of the Giants, both in San Francisco and before that at the Polo Grounds, when Willie Mays played stickball in the Harlem streets. But when the significance of the orange tie was mentioned to Willie Mays later, his eyes widened_ No, he said I never gave that a thought. Willie Mays had just grabbed the perfect tie without thinking, just as he used to make the perfect swing or the perfect catch without thinking. Willie Mays was perhaps the most natural ballplayer of all, one who not only thrived on the joy of baseball but who also projected that joy to all those who cherish the game.",1979-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,New Glenda Jackson Film Opens:The Cast,"Brut productions, which once brought you Glenda Jackson in. ""A Touch of Glass,"" this time presents her in circumstances that are decidedly dclass. ""The Class of Miss MacMichael,"" a rowdy reform-school story, features Miss Jackson as the standard good-Samaritan teacher whose fellowship with her students incurs the anger of the school's heartless supervisors.Ordinarily, this situation lends itself to sentimental moments (between the teacher and a few favorite students), heated arguments (each time the teacher does battle with the authorities), and sporadic incidents of violence (someone in the class, sooner or later, is bound to attack someone else). It also lends itself to classroom comedy, because sharing the kids' raucous jokes is the teacher's simplest way of showing which side she's on. ""The Class of Miss MacMichael"" incorporates all of the above, albeit somewhat wearily. It includes certain elements of confusion, too.Miss Jackson, seen here at her very frumpiest, always projects so much intelligence that even her light comedy roles take a serious turn; without sacrificing the humor, she manages to suggest that her behavior deserves to be taken seriously.But Oliver Reed, cast as the principal of the trade school where Miss Jackson works, is exclusively engaged in broad clowning, none of it very funny. Mr. Reed is forever pointing his chin at the heavens to suggest hauteur, and delivering such whiplash gestures it's a miracle he doesn't do the other actors bodily harm. Mr. Reed makes such a nonsensical antagonist for Miss Jackson that the whole tenor of her struggle becomes bewildering. How can one believe in her dedication to her class of happy hoodlums when the enemy is too much of a fool to be a villain?In all fairness, Mr. Reed is by no means the movie's only fool. Miss Jackson, in the interests of proving herself a good sport, smiles tolerantly when her students break into her apartment after hours and paint half of the place purple.Michael Murphy, in the thankless role of the American fellow Miss Jackson sips wine with after a long hard day, is understandably peeved by the extent to which the students have taken over his friend's life, and eventually he asks her to make a choice. In movies like this, there is usually only one choice to make. The one real stroke of originality of ""The Class of Miss MacMichael"" is its forestalling Miss Jackson's having to make any decision at all.Miss Jackson does nothing here that she hasn't done better elsewhere. The kids behave badly but act well, becoming nastily memorable as they revel in one another's bad company. Rosalind Cash, as one of Miss Jackson's fellow teachers, is a calming influence, imperturbable and half a beat behind everyone else. She provides a welcome contrast to Mr. Reed's hooting and hollering.",1979-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Your Turn, My Turn,' French Comedy Film:The Cast","Franois Leterrier's ""Your Turn, My Turn,"" the French comedy that opens today at the Cinema Studio 1, looks like a natural consequence of ""Cousin, Cousine,"" taking a very romantic view of an extramarital affair, though not simplifying the obstacles to the affair's happy conclusion. Most unusual about the new film, however, is its hard-line antikiddism. You haven't seen a film in years in which the children, who are meant (I think) to be realistically observed, have behaved like such monsters. After seeing ""Your Turn, My Turn,"" you may want to present yours with one-way tickets to Disneyland. These children are smug, demanding and impossibly high-toned brats of the sort who prefer health foods to good old-fashioned, teeth-ravaging candies.The movie is an adaptation by Daniele Thompson, Mr. Leterrier and Franoise Dorin of a novel by Miss Dorin. It's about Agnes (Marlene Jobert), the mother of a small boy and the bored wife of Serge (Daniel Duval), a rock-music promoter who has more time for his mistresses than for Agnes. Quite by accident, Agnes meets and falls in love with Vincent (Philippe Leotard), the divorced father of a 10-year-old daughter. Vincent is Mr. Right. He's a successful building contractor and a decent, down-to-earth fellow, something that seems to be associated with the way he dresses. Serge buys his clothes in boutiques. Vincent wears conventional clothes but he never, never wears a tie.The only impediment to the affair of Agnes and Vincent is her 7-year-old son, Jerome (Vladimir Andres), a precocious, self-centered boy who's never at a loss for words and who thoroughly disapproves of his mother's lover, though Serge couldn't care less. When the chips are down, and Agnes must choose between Vincent and Jerome, the lover hasn't a chance. That, however, is not the end.Actually, ""Your Turn, My Turn"" is both better and worse than this synopsis indicates. It never displays the cruelty that gave ""Cousin, Cousine"" some backbone. It has moments of such thick sentimentality and cuteness you may feel as if you're sitting in bubble gum. Yet, occasionally it is very funny and it has some very attractive supporting players, including Sylvie Jolly, who plays Vincent's physiotherapist-sister, a liberated lesbian, and Micheline Presle, still very beautiful and elegant, though her role here is virtually disposable.Most importantly, the film has Miss Jobert (""Rider in the Rain,"" ""That Wonderful Crook""), who is not the world's greatest actress but who may be France's most accomplished professional gamine. Small, red-haired and pleasingly freckled, Miss Jobert is aging without apparent damage. She has also dropped a lot of her laughter-through-tears moments that punctuated her earlier performances.Miss Jobert's Agnes is made of sturdy stuff. Also she seems to be a woman of intelligence and taste. I'm still not sure if Miss Jobert has great facility as an actress or is merely facile. In any case she's most pleasant to behold in this sort of nonsense, whether she's running into her lover's arms  no one matches her for footwork that expresses both need and abandon  or simply lounging around the house in a terry-cloth dressing gown, sitting in such a way that an expanse of upper thigh is always discreetly exposed.Mr. Leotard makes a nice foil for her, but because the movie is seen almost entirely from the woman's point of view, the character exists as not much more than a sex symbol. The film's treatment of Agnes's women friends, all of whom are seeking liberation of one sort or another, is well meaning but sometimes very silly.""Your Turn, My Turn"" is a mixed bag. The English subtitles are adequate and, in one case, rather overprotective of the audience's ignorance. When someone says he is going to the movies to see ""Jour de Fte,"" the subtitle tells us instead, ""I'm going to see a Tati film.""",1979-01-28T05:00:00+0000

The series offers a crosssection of dance, from the highly experimental work of Kenneth Rinker, an early member of Twyla Tharp's troup who is now on his own as choreographer and who will appear at the end of the series in midMarch, to the more traditional, such as tapdancers Jane Goldberg and Charles Cook, who represent the current interest in the form.

Ever since the SinoSoviet split in the early 1960's, the Russians have growled menacingly at all who have befriended Peking, hoping to mark China as a dangerous ally. For years Moscow tried to convene a conference of European Communist parties read Peking out of the movement, and for years the recalcitrant Yugoslays, Rumanians and others in Western parties refused until, in 1976, the Russians finally had to give up. Since Rumania insists on maintaining good relations with China, the Soviet Union has not even been able to get its own Warsaw Pact alliance to endorse an attack on Peking. After the death of Mao Tsetung in 1976, and especially in the past six months, China has launched a vigorous new foreign policy. Last August, it signed a friendship treaty with Japan. The same month, Chairman Hua Kuofeng ventured directly into the Soviet Union's sensitive backyard by visiting Yugoslavia, Rumania and Iran.

It grows on you. At first it seems as if it can scarcely talk, and when it does talk, it doesn't say very much, being about people who are inclined to punctuate their sentences with ""You know what I mean,"" when they themselves have only the fuzziest of notions and want help. Eventually, though, you see in ""Billy in the Lowlands"" unexpected resources of compassion and humor and, more important, of unsentimental honesty. It's a modest, awkward movie, but it's also a good one.Billy Shaughnessy (Henry Tomaszewski) is a teen-agers you may think you've met in a number of other movies, but never quite so unglamorized. Billy thinks he's hip, when he's only lazily bright. He's basically decent but can't help sliding into trouble out of carelessness. He lives with his mother and younger brother and works in a foundry  his parents have been separated for years. When asked, Billy says his father farms artichokes in California. Sometimes he says his father is a businessman. The only constants in the fantasy are that Billy doesn't often see his father and that his father lives in California.Mr. Egleson, who wrote and directed ""Billy in the Lowlands,"" keeps Billy's problems small, though we can understand how large they loom to him. Arrested for joyriding in a car stolen by a friend, he's packed off to a juvenile correction center that's not especially tough but is monumentally uninterested in him. His grandfather's death and the report that his father is coming east for the funeral prompt Billy to walk out of prison to begin a series of sadly inconsequential adventures. The climax  a reunion with his father  is a surprise only to Billy.According to my program notes, the cast includes amateurs and professionals, though, with one exception, I'd be hard put to tell which are which. Mr. Tomaszewski, I assume, is an amateur, but his dimly understood anger and his earnestness of small purpose are something more than a performance. They are the tone and style of the movie that understands Billy and the contradictions within him, ""They're never going to catch me,"" says Billy when he walks out of prison, adding, ""I don't care how long it takes.""Of the other actors, Paul Benedict is of the other actors, Paul Benedict is splendid as Billy's father, a lean, ravaged man who lives in Toledo, Ohio, not California, the sort of boozer who carries his bottle in the brown paper bag it came in. The two have a fine, agonizingly inarticulate scene on the beach at dawn near a deserted amusement park. Says the father, ""You know, Gramps invented the harpoon."" ""No kidding,"" says Billy, thinking that perhaps, at long last, he has stumbled on to something to distinguish his otherwise profoundly undistinguished heritage. ""No,"" says his father. ""He just used to say that.""""Billy in the Lowlands"" knows how life in the land of the blue blue collar looks. It catches the tempo of the speech, as well as the background sounds of traffic, whistles, transistor radios. Best of all, the movie appreciates the people without bending them into melodramatic poses.""Billy in the Lowlands"" opens today at the Entermedia Theater on Second Avenue at 10th Street, beginning a three-day run in the American Mavericks Festival that is showcasing independent films. Among the features that will follow ""Billy"" are Penny Allen's ""Property,"" John Carpenter's ""Dark Star"" and Henry Jaglom's ""Tracks."" The festival is one of the more interesting movie-happenings in town at the moment.",1979-01-31T05:00:00+0000
