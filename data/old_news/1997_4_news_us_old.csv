Sheila was our leader and friend. She was the first female President of Local 153-a local union of 20,000 members-in its 50-year history. Long before becoming president, she led the employees in organizing at Fordham University, even before they were covered by the NLRA. For years, she remained their chief representative in bargaining and union representation. In addition, she was instrumental in organizing other university members, helping to build what is now the Local's college and university division with 4,000 members throughout the tri-state area. Her leadership abilities led her to serve on the union's executive board from 1968. She also served as the Local's recording secretary and vice president, before she became president in 1983. She retired from the presidency in 1988, although she remained very active in the Local 153 Retirees' Association and served as trustee of the Lavina Michl Wright Scholarship for members' children. Throughout her years in the labor movement she received numerous awards, including the YWCA's Woman of Achievement Award in 1983 and an award from the AFL-CIO's Union Label and Service Trades Department. Sheila also served her own community as a member of the Asbury Park Woman's Club, a communicant of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and a member of its Cartonian Club and choir. Sheila was born in New York City, the youngest of nine children. She was married for more than 50 years to Jack Baker who died in 1993. She is survived by her two sons Thomas of Paris and John of New York, and three grandchildren. To them we send our sincerest condolences for their loss. It is a loss we share for an incomparable woman of both strength and gentleness, integrity, selflessness and love for humanity. We deeply mourn her passing. For more information, Buckely's Funeral Home in Asbury Park, New Jersey (908) 775-2455. Her funeral mass will occur at 10 AM, Tuesday, April 1, at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Deal, NJ.

By then, Mr. Patel was lost in a whirl of other transactions: a pack of Rolaids for a New Jersey man who had had one too many martinis, a map for a bewildered British tourist looking for Edna St. Vincent Millay's home, and a copy of Playgirl for a Charles Street resident of indeterminate gender wearing gold platform shoes and an aquamarine miniskirt.

us,Shop Till You Pop,"What's bad for the bedroom might be good for the credit-card balance. While seratonin re-uptake inhibitors (prozac is one) have been found to dampen sex drives, Donald Black, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa, reports that one drug in that category, fluvoxamine, might also curb a lust for shopping. In the first study of its kind, Black has been testing the drug as a treatment for shopaholics, who, he says, represent between 2 and 8 percent of the American population. So far, almost all of the participants (16 women and 1 man) in his study report that their shopping ardor has cooled. Black says that by enhancing the efficiency of the seratonin, a brain chemical that elevates mood, fluvoxamine appears to reduce anxiety, inappropriate urges and impulsiveness. Lesley Quinn, 42, who joined Black's study in October, says: ''Now I can shop with a list for a few things I need. I cut up all my credit cards.'' She has had little trouble with the drug's side effects -- sleep disturbances and nausea. Eric Hollander, a professor of psychiatry at Mt. Sinai medical school and a consultant on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, cautions that the study is preliminary but says that Black's work is ''very promising, very exciting.''",1997-04-06T05:00:00+0000

If it remains unsold, toward the end of the season it will be marked down, usually 30 to 40 percent, to about $830 to $965. After four to six more weeks, the suit will probably run about $415 to $550, more than $100 below wholesale. * At Century 21, an ''off-price'' store in lower Manhattan, the suit was selling for only $499.97. But Century 21 had it in sky blue (last year's color) rather than indigo (this year's). * This suit may end up in one of many Calvin Klein outlets, though a recent check with the Secaucus, N.J., store revealed that it hadn't made it there yet. If it does, it will probably sell for about half of Saks' full price, or $690. * If someone buys the suit but then decides that indigo is not her color, she can take it to a consignment shop like Ina, which specializes in samples and couture items and would sell this suit for an estimated $350. * If the suit hasn't sold after three months, Ina will either return it to the consignor or donate it to a charity like the Housing Works Thrift Shops, which would probably offer it for $175 to $200.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction,"Henry Clay Frick always intended to leave his art collection and sumptuous house at 70th Street and Fifth Avenue to the public. A millionaire by the time he was 30 years old, Frick (1849-1919), who made his fortune in the coke and steel industries, was a bold and discriminating collector. Not only did he acquire some of the greatest Old Masters in the world, as Charles Ryskamp, the director of the Frick Collection, writes, but his eye for contemporary works proved infallible. In ART IN THE FRICK COLLECTION: Paintings, Sculpture, Decorative Arts (Abrams, $60) Mr. Ryskamp has chronicled the evolution of Frick's collection, from the young millionaire's first trip to Europe in 1879, which laid the foundations for his later acquisitions, to his architectural plans for the house and grounds and his purchasing habits, which included living with paintings for months before deciding whether to buy. The museum's curators, Bernice Davidson, Susan Galassi, Edgar Munhall and Nadia Tscherny, have supplied brief though exceptionally lively and informative notes on the history and esthetic highlights of the artworks illustrated. The effect is that of being given a private tour of the museum's masterworks, including paintings by Piero della Francesca, Titian, Bronzino, Rembrandt and Vermeer, Renaissance bronzes, Chinese porcelains and French furniture and clocks. Though few people realize it, the Frick collection is anything but static: at least a third of the paintings now on view were acquired after Frick's death. This is an unusually elegant book that underscores how Frick's style of collecting became the prototype for many of the great American collections. Andrea Barnet",1997-04-06T05:00:00+0000

Impossibly pale and thin and chic saleswomen drifting here and there, aloof. A dancer's studio lined with clothes made of fabulous silks and cottons and leathers, simple colors, simple cuts, angelic collars, little buttons at the neck and the wrists, pants with perfect flare. A basket of scarves, cashmere and chiffon. There was a small selection, but I wanted everything. Everything looked good on me. I loved that store even if a T-shirt cost more than I'd spent on a winter jacket that year. Walking in there was like stepping into possibility. A new shirt could make you feel brand-new yourself for days. Sometimes I'd spend hours trying on the clothes, imagining what it would be like to wear them into the world. In the mirror I became French and sophisticated. I was walking in the Tuileries, surrounded by tulips. I was racing up the steps of the Eiffel Tower or drifting down the Seine on the deck of a boat. I was at Fouchon gorging on pastries. Until one day I shared the fitting room with Tama Janowitz and all her hair. She had a pile of beautiful things, and she could buy them all. The saleswoman, no longer aloof, gently took her selection, asking, ''Will that be all?'' Of me she asked, ''Anything for you?''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction,"It's always a pleasure to read the work of the British novelist Joanna Trollope. In A SPANISH LOVER (Random House, $23), as in ''The Men and the Girls,'' ''The Rector's Wife'' and ''The Choir,'' she offers us picturesque English villages and their appealing if troubled inhabitants. But this time, the Ur-Britishness seems less central to our enjoyment of the novel. Lizzie (happily married, professionally proficient, mother of four) and Frances (none of the above) are twins who have the sort of relationship in which Frances' needs are subsumed within Lizzie's bustling family life. But when Frances becomes passionately involved with a married Spaniard, everything changes, and her actions touch off a series of events that spiral downward as her relationship heats up: Lizzie's children run amok, Lizzie and Frances' mother leaves their father, and finally Lizzie's business and then her own marriage begin to falter. When disappointed by life, nearly all of Ms. Trollope's well-realized and likable characters blame only themselves, making every effort to shape up without undue whining or finger pointing. Along the way, Ms. Trollope gives us much to savor. Her story is filled with lively, astute and always affectionate insights into the abiding issues of marriage, motherhood and materialism, not to mention the destructive power of envy and the importance of living one's own life.

They can even visit the University of California Berkeley campus to see the (in all likelihood phony) medallion or coin Drake is supposed to have inscribed -- claiming the area for England -- and nailed to a tree. What is surprising is the failure to mention that the city was really founded by another Briton, William Richardson, in 1822 and called Yerba Buena by him. Richardson was second mate on a British whaler and he established the first settlement that lasted and became, eventually, a city, aided greatly by the 1849 gold rush.

us,S.E.C. QUESTIONS MOTOROLA'S ACCOUNTING IN NEXTEL DEAL,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned Motorola Inc.'s accounting in deferring a gain on a $1.65 billion deal with Nextel Communications Inc., Motorola said in its latest proxy statement. In the deal, announced in August 1994, Nextel acquired Motorola's wireless licenses in the United States in exchange for a 20 percent stake in Nextel. Motorola considered the deal a swap of assets and recorded no gain for 1995. But ''the S.E.C. asserts that the company should have recognized a gain by accounting for the transaction at fair value,'' according to the Motorola filing.

Mr. Lynch was born into a prominent political family in Jamaica, W.I., on Christmas Day, 1930. His father Leopold was a leader in the Labor Party, a member of Parliament for 36 years and Minister of local government. Vincent was an outstanding student at Oliver Park School and Titchfield High in Port Antonio. He started as a School Aide for the NYC Board of Ed. in 1974 and worked at IS 195 in Harlem for two decades. In addition to his job at the school store, he served as an advisor and ''father figure'' for thousands of students. His co-workers elected him Shop Steward, and his dedicated union work led to key assignments in the 23,000-member Local 372, which is part of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO. Mr. Lynch chaired the Political Action Committee of the Local which operates computerized telephone and puts hundreds of volunteers into the field in election campaigns and is well known as a powerhouse in city politics. He served as 2nd Vice President of Local 372 for many years, and represented the Union on disaster relief missions and at conferences in Africa, Israel and throughout the Caribbean region and the U.S. Beyond his official duties, he was a close friend and advisor to Local President Charles Hughes. ''He gave me and the entire Union the benefit of his insight and judgement without fear or favor,'' said Hughes ''more than an officer, more than a friend, Vincent was like a brother to me. The Union will never be able to replace his strength of character, his warmth and wit and his loving sparkling smile.'' As an immigrant himself, Lynch was particularly proud that he was named to chair DC 37's Citizenship Committee which set up the Union's Citizenship Program with the unanimous backing of the DC 37 Executive Board. In 1996, its first year, the program helped more than 1000 union members exchange their green cards for full citizenship in the U.S.A. Mr. Lynch is survived by his wife Audrey and children Sadia, Dominic, Yvonne and Amy. Interment will be in Jamaica, W.I. A memorial service will be held Monday, April 14, at 6:00 PM at The Cathedral Church of St. John The Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Ave., at 112 St. in NYC.

Not surprisingly, the clientele for her ascetic brand of elegance has a downtown New York air. The list includes artists -- Peter Halley and William Wegman -- the creative director Fabien Baron and the boutiques for Calvin Klein's CK line. Berke was therefore surprised when Frederick Kantor, an accountant, and Barbara Kaplan, a retail advertising executive, asked her to renovate their apartment in a prewar Central Park West building in Manhattan. Berke describes it as one of her ''fancier'' jobs, mainly because there are traditional rooms, wall-to-wall carpeting and painted plywood as opposed to the open-loft spaces, bare floors and exposed plywood of some of her other projects. But even the painted plywood in this apartment has Berke's esthetic written all over it. Her clients wanted a paneled study, but traditional wood paneling was not in the budget. Berke's ingenious solution was to take standard 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets, cut them into narrow widths to elongate their proportions and paint the panels a warm shade of ''not white,''' as she calls it. The result is the kind of chic that knows no price. P.V.",1997-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Grant's 72 movies illuminate the delectable, self-made style that was his and his alone. ''Nobody talked like that,'' Mr. McCann writes, ''not even Archie Leach in earlier years.'' Archibald Alexander Leach, born in Bristol, England, on Jan. 18, 1904, was a child for whom the good times ended early: one day the 9-year-old boy came home to find his beloved mother gone. His alcoholic father, a tailor's presser, had secretly committed her to a local asylum. Elsie Leach languished in the filthy, negligibly supervised asylum for nearly 25 years. It wasn't until her husband died that her son, by then 32 years old and a movie star, was alerted to her existence. Grant, a reserved, hard-working perfectionist who easily won the love and respect of friends and colleagues, lived by his own credo that ''it takes 500 small details to add up to one favorable impression,'' and was apparently no picnic for wives and lovers, who ultimately discovered the devil in his details. But at least three women in his life found him just perfect: his mother, to whom Grant was devoted after their reunion until she died in 1973, shortly before her 96th birthday; Jennifer Grant, his daughter; and his fifth wife, Barbara Harris. For the rest of the world, as the critic Pauline Kael noted, ''It makes us happy just to look at him.'' There are pictures galore in Geoffrey Wansell's CARY GRANT: Dark Angel (Arcade, $29.95), but the text is superficial. Mr. Wansell faults his 1984 biography of Grant, ''Haunted Idol,'' because ''it brought the dark side of his character to life, certainly, but did not quite balance it with proper tribute to his incandescent screen presence.'' Perhaps a third one will be the charm. Andrea Higbie",1997-04-13T05:00:00+0000

But Gorlin's own house is a modernist, cubelike structure, and, as he says, ''the modernist's dream is a wall of glass.'' Alas, the dream began to pall slightly. ''I felt the room looked a little bare,'' Gorlin explains, ''and my wife thought it was too cold.'' So Gorlin decided that curtains were the answer, but it was Carl D'Aquino, who had originally decorated the house, who suggested white parachute cloth as the fabric. Its light weight was a key, since the windows are nearly 20 feet tall. And its relative sheerness gives the curtains a diaphanous quality that changes the room without compromising its clean lines. For those architects who cringe at the idea of curtains, Gorlin is quick to note that the modernist deity Le Corbusier used them in many of his houses.

Mr. Lynch was born into a prominent political family in Jamaica, W.I., on Christmas Day, 1930. His father Leopold was a leader in the Labor Party, a member of Parliament for 36 years and Minister of local government. Vincent was an outstanding student at Oliver Park School and Titchfield High in Port Antonio. He started as a School Aide for the NYC Board of Ed. in 1974 and worked at IS 195 in Harlem for two decades. In addition to his job at the school store, he served as an advisor and ''father figure'' for thousands of students. His co-workers elected him Shop Steward, and his dedicated union work led to key assignments in the 23,000-member Local 372, which is part of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO. Mr. Lynch chaired the Political Action Committee of the Local which operates computerized telephone and puts hundreds of volunteers into the field in election campaigns and is well known as a powerhouse in city politics. He served as 2nd Vice President of Local 372 for many years, and represented the Union on disaster relief missions and at conferences in Africa, Israel and throughout the Caribbean region and the U.S. Beyond his official duties, he was a close friend and advisor to Local President Charles Hughes. ''He gave me and the entire Union the benefit of his insight and judgement without fear or favor,'' said Hughes ''more than an officer, more than a friend, Vincent was like a brother to me. The Union will never be able to replace his strength of character, his warmth and wit and his loving sparkling smile.'' As an immigrant himself, Lynch was particularly proud that he was named to chair DC 37's Citizenship Committee which set up the Union's Citizenship Program with the unanimous backing of the DC 37 Executive Board. In 1996, its first year, the program helped more than 1000 union members exchange their green cards for full citizenship in the U.S.A. Mr. Lynch is survived by his wife Audrey and children Sadia, Dominic, Yvonne and Amy. Interment will be in Jamaica, W.I. A memorial service will be held Monday, April 14, at 6:00 PM at The Cathedral Church of St. John The Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Ave., at 112 St. in NYC.

Despite the setback, the 1997 event is still tentatively scheduled for April 19 -- Knox County may seek a restraining order against the state on the clubs' behalf, as part of a larger legal challenge.

Our narrator is the Mistress of Spices herself, an old woman named Tilottama whose past is the stuff of legend. Born in India with the gift of prophecy, she is captured by pirates, rescued by sea snakes and transported to a remote island where a woman called the Old One instructs her in the special powers of spices. When her instruction is completed, Tilo can choose among various exotic locales in which to exercise her skills. She picks -- of all places -- Oakland, Calif., where she materializes as an old woman who runs a store called the Spice Bazaar. Since this is a novel about feminine insight and healing, Tilo can see what spices people need even before they speak. But the problems she encounters are disappointingly shopworn. Her only really interesting customer is a man she thinks of as ''the lonely American,'' who can see the true beauty beneath her wrinkled exterior. Naturally, he has a fascinating story of his own to tell. Tilo's magic is not without its drawbacks; she can bring on disaster if she is unskillful, especially if she lets her own wishes come into the picture. And so ''The Mistress of Spices'' becomes a novel about choosing between a life of special powers and one of ordinary love and compassion. If Tilo's choice is rather predictable, the way Ms. Divakaruni gets us there is anything but. David Guy",1997-04-13T05:00:00+0000

The Paul Mitchell team of stylists was putting the finishing touches on hairdos intended to demonstrate its creativity, working on a handful of models who sat meekly, oblivious to what was happening on top of their heads. In the end, it was the upsweep topped by a cascade of chain links, each wrapped in hair, that received the most enthusiastic applause. And then the throng moved on to inspect the merchandise on display: the scissors, timers, turbans, leopard-print robes, butterfly clips, salon chairs and -- among the more ingenious devices -- giant combs with a level embedded in the center, for cutting flattops.",1997-04-13T05:00:00+0000

us,OVER-THE-TOP GUN,"''We'll go supersonic in supercruise without afterburners,'' boasts Jeff Rhodes, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, the prime contractor for the Air Force's just-rolled-out F-22 fighter jet. The craft will cruise at more than 1,500 miles per hour and is supposed to be so stealthy and smart that enemy targets won't know they're under attack until they're blown away, a capability the Air Force briskly calls ''first look, first shot, first kill.'' Of course, it's all very expensive -- $70 billion for 438 F-22's, which will be built until 2013 -- and the jet was originally designed to pierce the air defenses of an enemy that no longer exists, the Soviet Union. Among the not-so-thrilled are Chuck Spinney, a Pentagon analyst who thinks the money would be better spent on the upgrading of existing jets. ''By 2013 we'll have a few new planes and a lot that are old,'' he says. ''But the Air Force wanted the F-22. It's that simple.''",1997-04-13T05:00:00+0000

The Officers, Board and Staff of the Weizmann Institute of Science and its American Committee are immensely grieved by the death of a luminous figure in all of our lives. As Executive Vice President from 1986 to 1995 and later as Executive Vice President Emeritus, he inspired ACWIS to record-setting achievements in support of the Institute. His fervor was contagious, his commitment total. With stubborn determination, he never allowed serious illness to slacken his pace. Eloquent and knowledgeable in support of basic scientific research as a vehicle of progress for the benefit of humankind, immensely proud of the role of Weizmann scientists in stimulating the economic strength of Israel, he set a personal example of total devotion, admired throughout the United States and the entire worldwide Wiezmann Family. He was an exceptionally effective bridge builder to the Institute community in Rehovot, sharing insights and wisdom with its leaders and scientists. We express our deepest sympathy to his wife of 38 years, Edith, to his daughter Audrey, sons Michael and William and the entire family. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Bernard and Edith Samers Scholarship Fund in Cancer Research at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

He's not playing the blues in their standard late-1990's form: a thumping, predictable 12-bar verse that makes way for showy guitar solos. While the songs borrow blues techniques, they aren't exactly blues tunes. Instead, Whitley infuses them with a spirit of the blues: a clear-eyed, fatalistic tone that accepts both exaltation and despair. He sounds like he's consorting with ghosts, and in a way he is.",1997-04-20T05:00:00+0000

''How Colleges Are Gouging: A Special Investigation Into Why Tuition Has Soared'' was the headline on the cover of a recent issue of Time magazine, evidently composed to heighten the annual anxiety about college acceptances. The story inside led off with the news that tuition and fees at the University of Pennsylvania next year will be $21,130 and went on to accuse universities of hoarding endowment income and squeezing parents willing to pay anything to buy their children a B.A. An accompanying article questioned whether President Clinton's proposal to allow tax deductions for tuition won't ''encourage colleges to raise tuition even higher.''",1997-04-20T05:00:00+0000

We remain inspired by the remarks he made after his visit to Boys Town. ''The things I saw here today convince me that Boys Town Jerusalem is truly unique. This outstanding institution of Torah and technology gives its students not only a comprehensive education but a sense of respect and love for the People and the State of Israel. Behind the name of Boys Town Jerusalem rests an exalted conceptone which brings together the youths of all tribes of Israel and unites them in the spirit of the Torah, 'whose ways are ways of pleasantness and whose paths are all of peace.' Here, one learns not to shut oneself in, not to be isolated from the community of Israel, but rather to be an involved, creative and responsible citizen of Israel as it takes the first steps on the road to redemption. If there is any development that should give us cause for concern, it is the splintering of the Jewish People into sects and groups of all kinds. At Boys Town Jerusalem, I have found a source of hope I have found a source of hope for unity and love between the different parts of the Jewish People. The students of Boys Town Jerusalem leave here strengthened in their Torah and in their faith, able to identify heart and soul with the building of the State of Israel, and appreciative of the contributions of all segments of our nation, without exception, to Israel's redemption. Boys Town Jerusalem's graduates are spread throughout the land. They have fought in the ranks of the Israel Defense Forces, shoulder to shoulder with their brothers from cities, villages and kibbutzim. Many have fallen in battle, and their names are inscribed forever in the hearts of our People. In the weekly portion of the Prophets, we read: 'And the people shall all be righteous and they shall inherit the land forever; they are the offshoots of My plantings, the glorious works of My hands. The small shall grow into thousands, and the young shall become a mighty nation. These wonderful verses are fitting to be said of Boys Town Jerusalem. May there indeed be more of you.'' May there be many more like Chaim Herzog. May the Almighty comfort his family among the mourners of Zion and Jersualem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Alexander S. Linchner, V.

us,"In Suburbia, More Barriers to Hurdle","THERE they were, two of the most famous black athletes of all time, Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis, playing golf at a predominantly Jewish country club not far from Robinson's spacious home in Stamford. The year was 1956, Robinson's last season as a Brooklyn Dodger and five years after Louis's last fight. It was also the last year Robinson, an ardent golfer, would play at the High Ridge Country club, which straddled the border of Stamford and Pound Ridge, N.Y. and was, as he himself once put it, ''a few good wood shots from my home.'' The reason? Racial barriers. Just two years earlier, Robinson and his wife, Rachel, had surmounted one racial hurdle by acquiring a home on a six-acre tract of land in a previously all-white section of North Stamford. ''We had outgrown the house we owned in a racially mixed neighborhood in St. Albans, Queens, and decided to look in Stamford because it was close enough for Jack to commute to Brooklyn,'' Mrs. Robinson recalled.

''No matter how many stares they drew as oddly dressed strangers,'' Ms. Edwards tells us, ''they knew that soon they'd hold an audience of these same people breathless, spellbound.'' Ms. Edwards's stories are every bit as confident as her trapeze artists and just as skilled at evoking wonder. In ''Spring, Mountain, Sea,'' a soldier takes his Asian bride to upstate New York. Neighbors teach Jade Moon the finer points of macaroni and cheese, for which she thanks them with a carefully prepared fish. When the Americans gag, Jade Moon turns away from her husband's culture -- but she also plants a message of love that he'll find decades later, ''three small strokes of language that reconstructed their shared past.'' Ms. Edwards captures the sweep of those decades in a single story, and an impressive swath of the world in the book as a whole. One hero, Mohammed Muda Nor, must choose between duty and hope when gold is discovered in his Malaysian village. Half a world away, Marie Bonvin recalls dusting the laboratories of Marie Curie and tells with awe of touching Madame's ''jars, lined up on the rough boards, glowing softly in the dusk.'' Even in stories that stay close to home, characters find new wonder -- and terror -- in the familiar.

So when Patrick H. Phelan, a 39-year-old immigrant from Northern Ireland, died last year of a suspicious gunshot wound -- the bullet was fired from the service revolver of an off-duty police officer, Richard J. Molloy -- it might have been expected that the community would rally behind the officer, who contended that the wound was self-inflicted.

us,Criticism Either Way,"Janet Reno is not the first Attorney General to find herself in an uncomfortable squeeze between partisan politics and criminal law. ''I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't,'' the somewhat exasperated Attorney General said last week after she rejected Republican demands to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate how Democrats raised millions of dollars to re-elect President Clinton. Her decision infuriated Republicans like Speaker Newt Gingrich who compared her to John N. Mitchell, President Nixon's Attorney General during Watergate, who went to prison for obstructing the Watergate investigation. Her refusal to seek an outside prosecutor represented a change for Ms. Reno, who in the past has been criticized by Democrats for being too quick to refer cases to outside prosecutors.

You Can Say That Again!,"Alice Thomas Ellis was brought up on the north coast of Wales in a town called Penmaenmawr, a place with ''a slightly schizoid air'' where, even by midcentury, the hotels and villas built by wealthy Edwardian vacationers had never quite conquered the old hill farms -- not to mention the granite quarries -- of the local people. Small wonder, then, that her memoir, A WELSH CHILDHOOD (Moyer Bell, $34.95), seems gleefully intent on ruffling the genteel surfaces of Patrick Sutherland's accompanying photographs. At times, the Sutherland-Ellis team seems distinctly schizoid itself. Ms. Ellis (a novelist best known for her trilogy, ''The Summer House'') makes it plain early on that she has ''never much cared for panoramic views and vast sights unless something unusual or interesting is happening to them.'' Which is why, as her text rambles past a handsome photograph of mist-shrouded Holyhead Mountain, there is no cloyingly rapturous hymn to nature -- just a satisfying rant about the bad press the Romans gave the Druids, accompanied by a deft story featuring a local tradesman called Uncle Roberts, who took young Alice on his rounds ''as cover'' for what ''must have been smuggling forays.'' Part reminiscence, part grab bag of historical and social curiosities, part meditation on such difficult subjects as death and happiness (with detours into the evils of tourism and suburbia), Ms. Ellis's book is not cozy and not for children. It's for grown-ups with a taste for the bracingly idiosyncratic, for a writer who bristles with sardonic charm. Alida Becker",1997-04-20T05:00:00+0000

''It's like having an opening every night.'' The high visibility is due to the alternative space's new 170-seat cinema, which can double as a performance space, next to the gallery. Moviegoers, needing something to occupy them before the nightly screening, can idle in the cafe, also new, or wander into the gallery. Real Art's visual arts program may be getting its large audience by default, but, once inside, the crowd has a chance of being genuinely stimulated by the goings-on.",1997-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,International Style,"Izhar patkin approaches the design of a room in the same way he paints a painting. He uses color, texture and scale to construct a narrative assembled from an international smorgasbord of cultural imagery. A few years ago, he made a 14-foot-tall, blown-glass sculpture of a dancer, which combines features of the Hindu god Shiva, Carmen Miranda and Josephine Baker. Now he's at work on a series of 101 paintings using Oriental rug motifs called, aptly enough, ''Gardens for the Global City.'' So it's no surprise that the interiors of his nearly 20,000-square-foot home and studio vibrate with the same world beat. The seemingly endless series of spaces -- part of a former vocational school in the East Village that Patkin and some friends bought and divided up -- is designed so that the areas open directly one onto another, creating long vistas that Patkin terms ''visual escapes.'' These doorways offer glimpses of brilliant, saturated wall colors, fabrics from India and North Africa and furnishings that evoke tales of faraway lands -- even if they come from no place more exotic than an upstate yard sale. Patkin's eye for color and pattern and his talent for recycling mundane materials into idiosyncratic objects render the ordinary extraordinary. These rooms are a tribute to the consistency of his vision, which transcends stylistic boundaries. ''It's not about a style,'' he says of both his home and his work.

Feder was among the first young men inducted into the Army in 1940 and he spent the next six years in the Pacific Theater, where he rose through the ranks to become a major.

''She's the real thing,'' gushes James Jorden, Parterre's editor. ''She gives you that extra something in a performance so you can't sleep afterward.'' Jorden, 42, edits the bimonthly zine and Web site, a raucous celebration of the longstanding subculture of opera queens, gay men whose passion for the art borders on obsessive. Parterre Box approves of divas who work hard, sing hard and believe in what they're doing -- no matter how outrageous their performances on and off the stage. It loathes ''phonies who are all P. R. and no action.'' Jorden's love of opera isn't always reciprocated. He claims he was once shown the door at the Met by a homophobic guard who tore up copies of the zine. The Met denies it and refuses to apologize, leaving Jorden a tad steamed. ''They're democratic at the Met,'' he snipes. ''They're equally rude to everyone.''",1997-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Adults Behaving Badly,"Karin Cook's first novel, WHAT GIRLS LEARN (Pantheon, $23), is a good argument for always keeping a box of tissues on your night table. What at first seems to be a well-written but not unpredictable coming-of-age story -- about two sisters approaching adolescence and facing the fact that their divorced mother has fallen in love -- develops into a much darker and more disturbing tale. Tilden, the 12-year-old narrator, is less confident and outgoing than Elizabeth, 11, and she worries about adjusting when they move with their mother, Frances, to the Long Island home of Frances' new boyfriend, Nick. The time is 1980 and Ms. Cook gets all the pre-teen iconography right: watermelon lip gloss, television's ''Brady Bunch'' and purloined copies of that bible for the pubescent, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves.'' But these humorous details are overshadowed by Frances' sudden hospitalization for breast cancer and by the arrival of her brother, Rand, an alcoholic drifter who is by turns protective and predatory toward the girls. One of the novel's themes is the fraying that truth undergoes in the hands of family members, and Ms. Cook sensitively describes Tilden's efforts to understand the oblique codes of the adults. Unfortunately, readers must cope with just as many secrets: we never learn any more about the girls' biological father or the reasons for Rand's weaknesses than they do, and Nick emerges as little more than a kind man with bad taste in music. Ms. Cook triumphs completely, however, in her achingly nuanced depiction of a young girl's fierce love for her brave mother. She also succeeds in capturing the essential bond between siblings, who fight here ''the way only sisters can fight -- with the luxury of forever and forgiveness at hand.''

us,Munch the Printmaker,"''Munch is our contemporary, as he will be the contemporary of our children's children, because his subject is life in the present tense, which may pass in and out of intellectual vogue but will not become obsolete.'' So Peter Schjeldahl, art critic for The Village Voice, writes in THE SYMBOLIST PRINTS OF EDVARD MUNCH: The Vivian and David Campbell Collection (Art Gallery of Ontario/Yale University, $50). Certainly the prints reproduced in this revelatory book support Mr. Schjeldahl's claims -- and then some. But as Michael Parke-Taylor, associate curator of European art at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, writes in an informative essay, despite Munch's lifetime reputation in Norway and Germany (where he is considered one of the greatest European modern artists), a similar level of appreciation and awareness of Munch's work did not reach this country until 1950, when a retrospective exhibit first appeared. Elizabeth Prelinger, chairwoman of the department of art, music and theater at Georgetown University, writes that it was through his prints that Munch (1863-1944) achieved the Symbolist ideal of fusion between the meaning of the image and the technique used to give it form. She also provides valuable background information on his technique. But Mr. Schjeldahl's essay best captures Munch's achievement. Commenting on the timeless appeal of Munch's best-known work, ''The Scream,'' he writes, ''It is a template of creativity that discovers a way to say the unsayable by giving over to an internal logic of saying.''

A curator and a Rajput prince, Mapu -- his given name is Martand Singh -- is also a man generally acclaimed here for the refinement of his eye.

He was the champion of that plain-spoken, full-throated tradition of American verse going back to Williams, Pound and Whitman, and even more than they did, he liberated poetry from the library and took it boldly into the cafes and onto the street corner. He believed in poetry of the people, not the professoriate. But though he would have been amused by the comparison, there was also something Wordsworthian about Ginsberg: he wrote his best, most impassioned poetry as a young man and then settled into a long middle age as a twinkling, gray-bearded laureate, turning out lyrics and reams of what amounted to occasional verse -- some of it memorable, more of it not. He was a cultural busybody -- an inspired yenta -- turning up at protests, rallies, rock concerts, love-ins; but he brought to these occasions not rage or dogma so much as a kind of avuncular concern. In the end, his most enduring contribution to our culture may be less such works as ''Howl'' and ''Kaddish'' than the way that, humming and chanting and clicking away on his finger cymbals, he transformed the American avant-garde, and the angry alienation of the Beats, into something altogether more cheerful and benign. Some of his later poems take radical pleasure in the deeply ordinary and in a form of transcendence that seems almost middle-class: getting high, making love, raiding the icebox. ''Gone Gone Gone,'' part of an unfinished collection, was written last year. Charles McGrath",1997-04-27T05:00:00+0000
