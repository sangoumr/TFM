Some foods like steak or hamburger should be cooked quickly, close to the coals, to be seared outside but rare or medium rare within. Foods that must be thoroughly cooked, like chicken or pork, require lower heat for a longer period of time; move them to cooler areas on the grill. Cook chicken skin-side down first. Turn red meat when juices begin to pool on the surface. Other foods should be turned about halfway through the cooking time. With uneven cuts, like boneless butterflied legs of lamb, trim away thinner areas as they are done, unless you want some well-done slices. Here are some approximate cooking times: $ Food Total Cooking Time Beef, hamburgers 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare Beef, steak 1 1/2 inches thick 10 to 15 minutes for medium rare Chicken, boneless breasts 10 to 15 minutes Chicken, parts or whole split 30 to 35 minutes Fish, steaks or fillets 8 to 12 minutes Fish, whole 10 minutes per inch of thickness Lamb, butterflied leg 20 to 45 minutes Lamb, double chops 12 to 18 minutes for medium rare Shrimp, jumbo 5 minutes Veal, chops 1 1/2 inches thick 20 minutes for medium",1989-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"ARMED AND FEMALE. By Paxton Quigley. (Dutton, $18.95.) Paxton Quigley's ''Armed and Female'' begins as a provocative and intriguing examination of the arming of American women. One out of every eight women in the United States, or approximately 12 million, has a gun in her purse, car or home, according to a 1988 Gallup poll. Ms. Quigley, a former anti-gun activist who helped found the National Committee for Handgun Control, now keeps a gun in her home. The issues surrounding gun ownership and the violence that has provoked growing numbers of women to buy guns would indeed be a compelling read, if only Ms. Quigley stuck to the subject. Instead, she quickly exhausts two years of interviews with scores of women, many of whom were victims of violence and purchased guns out of fear. These vivid first-person accounts offer a stronger argument for female gun ownership than any of the expert opinion provided by criminologists, law enforcement officers or gun lobbyists in subsequent chapters. Without them, the book reads like a gun manual. Everything you wanted to know about guns is presented in painstaking detail, from advice on where to buy a gun to how to clean and store it. There is little in these chapters that specifically speaks to or about women. Except for the author's own personal preference of weaponry and ammunition, the advice would just as well apply to men.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000
us,FICTION,"SWEET DESSERTS. By Lucy Ellmann. (Viking, $17.95.) If there's a graduate student out there preparing a dissertation on ''The Importance and Meaning of Food to Women in Contemporary Fiction,'' Lucy Ellmann's ''Sweet Desserts'' is a novel to know about. In it, two sisters named Fran and Suzy Schwarz both turn into secret eaters as they grow up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill. (where, as children, they lose their mother to a cerebral hemorrhage), move to Oxford, England (where their art historian father has accepted a position), become art historians themselves and trundle to London and back to the United States according to what happens to the ineffectual men they live with, marry and separate from. Ms. Ellmann's theory is that women's overeating has to do with repressed desire for and anger at men. Whether or not this makes the psychology just a little too simple, Ms. Ellmann keeps it funny by setting the two sisters against a father whose main claim to scholarly fame is his hatred for Rubens. Lucy Ellmann's own father was the biographer Richard Ellmann, so this may be an autobiographical exercise. But it is also a tribute to his devotion to Oscar Wilde, at least in the sense that the younger Ellmann writes with grace, grit and a gift for the epigram. ''Sweet Desserts,'' which won Britain's Guardian Prize for a first novel, is a book that looks to achieve its effects through the accumulation of unchronological recollections interrupted by snippets of magazine self-help tips, recipes and quotations from ''King Lear,'' with the aim of driving home just how disjointed Suzy's life is. But in scanting Fran's experiences, in giving mere glimpses of other characters, Ms. Ellmann has made the not uncommon mistake of thinking that skimpy lives can be adequately represented in a book of skimpy length.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE,"Why do outhouse doors have crescent moons on them? Ronald S. Barlow tells us the symbol was originally intended for the edification of illiterate rustics - the moon, a traditional female sign, indicated the women's john, a radiant sun the men's. Since women's outhouses were generally kept in better repair than the men's, more of them survived, until finally the moon became the universal outhouse trademark. If that's the kind of nugget you'd like to regale your companions with next time you're invited to the White House, THE VANISHING AMERICAN OUTHOUSE (Windmill Publishing, 2147 Windmill View Road, El Cajon, Calif. 92020, $15.95) is for you. Mr. Barlow, a publisher and antiquarian, traces the outhouse's history in a loosely organized collection of essays covering such topics as the genteel art of privy digging and the evolution of toilet paper. We learn about the place of the outhouse in literature (numerous poems on the subject are reprinted, including ones by such luminaries as Robert W. Service and James Whitcomb Riley). We marvel at the many examples of outhouse art, including lavish reproductions of comical outhouse postcards. In one passage rich with irony, we learn that one of the little-known achievements of the Works Progress Administration during the Depression was the provision of 2.3 million ''sanitary privies'' of superior design, built by teams of federally trained and funded specialists. Had even a fraction of these facilities survived, one has to think, the Pentagon's toilet-seat procurement operation would not be in the doghouse today. The book includes scores of instructive photos, many in color. Of particular interest is a two-page spread devoted to the legendary brick outhouse.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"The Accidental Tourist 1988. Warner Home Video. 2 hours, 1 minute. $89.95. Laser disk, $29.98. Closed captioned. PG. Based on a novel by Anne Tyler and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this dark, somber picture, ''unaccountably voted the best film of 1988 by the New York Film Critics' Circle,'' forgets that movies have a language of their own. It ''often relies on Miss Tyler's methods without tempering them, and gives a tone of crashing obviousness to material that need not have seemed that way.'' The plot proves diffuse and rambling. As a writer of travel guides for business people, William Hurt is abandoned by his wife of 20 years, played by Kathleen Turner, and hits rock bottom. So does the film, as he takes up with a dog trainer, who - meant to be charmingly offbeat - proves insufferable, despite Geena Davis's best efforts in the role. (Janet Maslin) I'm Gonna Git You Sucka 1988. MGM/UA Home Video. 1:27. A cheerful and gag-filled (though not terribly sharp-toothed) sendup of the blaxploitation genre, this film actually owes more to the ''anything goes'' humor of the ''Airplane!'' school. Keenen Ivory Wayans, who wrote and directed, plays the nice-guy hero somewhat blandly. Bernie Casey, Isaac Hayes and Jim Brown play cranky middle-aged shadows of their former selves. Though the film is capable of dipping into unexpectedly low humor, its script is genuinely funny at times, ''a lively but uncertain mixture of nostalgia, silliness and genuinely unpredictable humor.'' (Maslin) Cocoon: The Return 1988. CBS/Fox Home Video. 1:56. $89.98. LD (Image Entertainment), $39.98. CC. PG. In a film ''so tired . . . that it can barely recapitulate the winning formula of the original hit,'' all the actors from ''Cocoon'' return as elderly people enjoying a delirious resurgence of youth, having spent the last several years on the planet Antarea losing track of earthly time. This weary sequel does have a few things to recommend it: Tak Fujimoto's cinematography ''gives a crisp, lively look to the Florida scenery.'' And some of the actors - particularly Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy - ''radiate grace and gallantry even when the material does not.'' (Maslin) Frida 1984. Connoisseur Home Video. 1:48. $79.95. Subtitled. Not rated. This Mexican film is an affectionate and affecting tribute to the colorful native artist and political radical Frida Kahlo, who died in 1954 at the age of 47. Paul Leduc, who directed, has not attempted a standard biography. The series of bright tableaux flows not in chronological order, but ''elegantly in a sort of order of the spirit.'' Ofelia Medina stars, and Juan Jose Gurrola plays Frida's husband, the painter and political activist Diego Rivera. ''What Mr. Leduc and Ms. Medina do is open up a life to us in the way that Kahlo herself attempted in her art. Whatever the real Kahlo was like, in their movie, she is vibrant.'' (Walter Goodman) Middle Age Crazy 1980. CBS/Fox. 1:35. $59.98. R. This entertaining movie about sex, far from being pornographic, soon turns into a highly moral lecture on responsibilities and love, and ends in a tide of sentiment. Bruce Dern stars as a Houston architect, whose wife, played by Ann-Margret, is lustily intent on setting a record in connubial relations. This and other pressures drive him to flights of fantasy and a bout of infidelity, but home and hearth ultimately prevail. ''John Trent has directed Carl Kleinschmitt's screenplay along an earthy, human, believable course.'' (Richard F. Shepard) Each Dawn I Die 1939. MGM/UA. 1:32. $19.95. No rating. When this film appeared, a critic - accustomed ''to serv [ ing ] out a term in at least one Warner prison picture every month, with no time off for good behavior'' - found it ''of secondary quality.'' Still, it has achieved classic status, if only on the strength of its stars. The critic found the story of James Cagney's framing ''wildly implausible,'' but acknowledged that ''Mr. Cagney almost plays it plausibly,'' while George Raft ''ably seconds him as the big-shot gangster who becomes his friend, and subsequent liberator, through familiar exigencies of a Warner prison term.''",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"PRETTY WOMEN. By Kate Coscarelli. (New American Library, $18.95.) A sharp political sensibility distinguishes this otherwise routine piece of commercial fiction by the author of ''Perfect Order.'' The novel opens in 1976, when a mysterious phone call reminds Tess Kipling, the dean of women at a California university, and Samara Mulhare, the head of a Hollywood studio, of their shared past as the wives of United States Air Force officers stationed in Libya in the 1950's. The bulk of the action takes place during those years on the American base in Tripoli, where the men must contend with a sadistic commanding officer, Brick Masters, while strong-minded Tess and Samara struggle to adjust to a world in which women are expected to devote their lives to supporting their husbands' careers. Kate Coscarelli is at her best when she's evoking the rigid, hierarchical society of the postwar armed services. And the denouement of ''Pretty Women,'' which reunites the scattered principals roughly 20 years later, reveals the degree to which some of the officers subordinated morality to their desire to please their unscrupulous commandant. Ms. Coscarelli nicely draws the obvious parallels between the cover-up her characters expose and the then-recent Watergate scandal, and her larger point about the dangers of unquestioning obedience to authority is timeless. Unfortunately, she's rooted her ideas in a cliched plot, complete with an utterly implausible device for its resolution and a group of characters without much emotional depth. Still, it's a pleasure to read a popular novel in which the main concerns are ethical rather than sexual or sartorial.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"NO EASY PLACE TO BE. By Steven Corbin. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) It's easy to imagine buoyancy in the mood above 125th Street in Manhattan during the 1920's, a time when all the women seemed to be bold and unconventional, with hands that were creamy soft rather than calloused from scrubbing floors or picking cotton. And their nails, of course, were painted red. Steven Corbin's first novel, ''No Easy Place to Be,'' presents that era through the eyes and lives of three black sisters who come of age during the Harlem Renaissance. But, unfortunately, it falls short of capturing the vivacity of the period. Each sister has her story: Miriam is a nurse at Harlem Hospital who channels her impatience with integration into Marcus Garvey's ill-fated Universal Negro Improvement Association; Velma, a Barnard-educated writer, travels between the salons of Greenwich Village and Harlem; Louise, the youngest sibling, is a fair-skinned Cotton Club dancer who finds happiness only after passing for white. But as Mr. Corbin describes their lives, one must struggle to feel the spontaneity and vitality of their experiences. It's particularly dismaying to note that the author slips, perhaps inadvertently, into the clumsy, somewhat simplistic characterization of black Harlem as tough and difficult - in contrast to downtown white Manhattan, where everything appears to be not only better but more attractive. And so, while the novel has its high points, it quickly becomes clear that Harlem in the period between 1919 and 1929 is no easy place for Mr. Corbin to make his debut.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Moskowitz had spent a year in London, where he became familiar with the work of artists like Peter Blake, and when he returned to New York in 1960 at the age of 25 he brought with him collages incorporating window shades. Coming not long after Robert Rauschenberg exhibited his ''Bed'' and Jasper Johns completed his ''Shade,'' Mr. Moskowitz's works seemed very much of the moment. Or at least they appeared so to William Seitz, a curator who included the collages in a group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961, and to Leo Castelli, who sponsored Mr. Moskowitz's first solo show the following year.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

It covers the usual trip from the bush leagues to victory and defeat in the big leagues and retirement. But happily Mr. Baylor, collaborating with Claire Smith, a baseball columnist for The Hartford Courant, tells his story calmly, without hyperventilating, without trying to create a sensation with some nasty revelation about a teammate or a manager. And there is a blessed and refreshing lack of the scatological dialogue that spatters the pages of many books by sports heroes. But why bother to read one more book by a good, even very good, but not great athlete like Don Baylor? Well, if you pick it up and give it a chance, the story of a man working hard at baseball just carries you along, like an ordinary baseball game played well on a warm Saturday afternoon in the middle of the season. Don Baylor is the only player to play in three consecutive World Series for three different teams (the Red Sox in 1986, then the Minnesota Twins and the Oakland A's). He grew up in a black ghetto in Austin, Tex. While racism among fans is muted in the majors, Mr. Baylor was bothered by it in the 1960's while playing in minor-league towns like Marion, Va., and Wytheville, Tenn., where ''a beer-bellied hillbilly . . . called me everything but a nigger.'' He played three seasons for the Yankees, respected but did not like Billy Martin, remembers that Graig Nettles was called Puff because he disappeared so fast after a game, avoiding his teammates and reporters.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE TWO DEATHS OF SENORA PUCCINI, by Stephen Dobyns. (Penguin, $7.95.) A rich surgeon in a fictional Latin American land tells the story of the woman he has tried to terrorize into loving him for 20 years. ''Mr. Dobyns skillfully examines the way desire can translate into a passion for control,'' Angeline Goreau said here in 1988. ''What makes this novel so memorable, however, is his powerful evocation of the ultimately corrupting influence of that control.'' NORA: A Biography of Nora Joyce, by Brenda Maddox. (Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.) Who could have guessed that when a young Irish chambermaid named Nora Barnacle eloped with an aspiring writer named James Joyce, it would be a mismatch made in heaven? Last year our reviewer, Edna O'Brien, said Brenda Maddox shows that Nora, the model for Molly Bloom, was an important inspiration. ''She brings us closer to Nora and reveals her not as the dormant (doormat, as Joyce might say) wife, but a vital, moody, outspoken young woman whose two greatest assets were her sexual assurance and her apparent unflappability.'' GIRL, 20, by Kingsley Amis. (Summit, $8.95.) A middle-aged British composer refuses to understand why he can't have everything he enjoyed when he was young: the excitement of left-wing political rallies and a girlfriend 17 years old. In 1972 our reviewer, R. V. Cassill, said the novel's cast of characters ''has been adroitly shaped to expose a sort of folie a deux in which youth and an aging misleader of youth contribute equally to the mischief.'' Summit has also reprinted ONE FAT ENGLISHMAN ($8.95), in which a gluttonous English publisher practices his lechery in the United States. ''Mr. Amis has a penetrating eye, a salty wit and the power of vivid portrayal,'' one reviewer said in 1964. BEING WITH CHILDREN, by Phillip Lopate. (Poseidon, $9.95.) A novelist and essayist tells about his experiences trying to teach writing to children on New York's Upper West Side. Phillip Lopate is ''a poet who sets out to tell us about his own experience only and ends by bringing us an affecting picture of modern urban life,'' Vivian Gornick said here in 1975. SUMMER'S LEASE, by John Mortimer. (Penguin, $7.95.) Uprooting themselves from London for a summer in Tuscany, the members of the Pargeter family find themselves caught in a number of scandals, sexual and otherwise. ''Mr. Mortimer had fun with 'Summer's Lease,' '' Ann Cornelisen said in The Book Review in 1988. ''His readers will too, whether they dream of a villa in Tuscany or a beach in the Hamptons.'' WHEN THE MIND HEARS: A History of the Deaf, by Harlan Lane. (Vintage, $15.95.) For hundreds of years, deaf people have tried to make the hearing understand that words need not be spoken - or even written - to qualify as language. ''The one true deafness, the incurable deafness, is that of the mind,'' as Victor Hugo once wrote. '' 'When the Mind Hears' reads like a suspense novel,'' Stella Chess said here in 1984. ''The villains are those, mostly hearing but a few deaf, who viewed those who had only signing skills as inferior in all ways, subhumans who were to be barred from associating with other deaf persons, prevented from marrying lest they have deaf sons and daughters, prohibited from having a language suited to their needs.'' THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT, by Ed McBain. (Mysterious Press, $3.95.) A salt-of-the-earth Indiana farmer named Ralph is outraged at his brother Jonathan's gay life style, complete with a beach house in the Florida Keys. But he insists that he did not kill him. ''It all adds up to an exceptionally fast-paced effort,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. THE RAGMAN'S SON: An Autobiography, by Kirk Douglas. (Pocket Books, $5.50.) Born to a family of illiterate Russian-Jewish immigrants in upstate New York, Issur Danielovitch moved to Manhattan, changed his name to Kirk Douglas and made 75 films. When his life story was published last year, our reviewer, Susan Stamberg, said that its strength and its weakness lie in the fact that he wrote it himself. ''It has the freshness and pell-mell quality of firsthand telling. But it lacks the deep analysis and introspection that a good ghostwriter might have pushed him toward.'' ROSIE, by Anne Lamott. (North Point, $8.95.) Not yet in her teens, Rosie finds herself caring for her widowed mother, who can't seem to do much of anything since her husband was killed in a car crash. Anne Lamott ''describes the mother-daughter bond with a sharp and graceful style,'' Diane Cole said here in 1984. MILENA: The Story of a Remarkable Friendship, by Margarete Buber-Neumann. Translated by Ralph Manheim. (Schocken, $8.95.) In 1940 the author was imprisoned in the Ravensbruck concentration camp with the Czechoslovak journalist Milena Jesenska, the woman to whom Franz Kafka wrote his passionate ''Letters to Milena.'' Last year our reviewer, James D. Bloom, called this account ''inspiring and sobering.'' WITHIN OUR REACH: Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage, by Lisbeth B. Schorr with Daniel Schorr. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) When society finally disabuses itself of the myth that nothing works, ''we can mobilize the political will to reduce the number of children hurt by cruel beginnings,'' Lisbeth Schorr writes. In 1988 our reviewer, Richard R. Green, the Schools Chancellor who died this year, said the book ''presents a useful, progressive antidote to those overly pessimistic critics who insist that we are losing ground in the fight to provide quality educational and social welfare services to an underclass of economically and socially disadvantaged families.''",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

The 29-year-old Green rebounded from a double-bogey on the 16th hole with a birdie on 17 and finished 54 holes over the 6,261-yard Beaconsfield Golf Club in Montreal at nine-under-par 216. She was three shots better than the first- and second-round leader, Betsy King; the 1983 champion, Hollis Stacy, Jane Geddes and Penny Hammel in the richest tournament on the L.P.G.A. tour. Hammel tied Nina Foust for the day's best round, with a 68. King, who began the day at eight under, bogeyed the 6th, 9th and 11th holes and finished with a two-over-par 74.(AP) Mize and McCumber Share Lead: Larry Mize and Mark McCumber capitalized on two late bogeys by Paul Azinger to move into a tie for the lead after yesterday's third round of the $1 million Western Open at Oak Brook, Ill. Mize, the 1987 Masters champion, shot a five-under-par 67 while McCumber, who needed an ice treatment on the 10th hole for his ailing back, had a 71. Both were tied at 10-under-par 206 after 54 holes over the Butler National course. Azinger, who led by a stroke after 16 holes, bogeyed the last 2 to finish at par 72 and was tied with Peter Jacobsen at 207.(AP) Auto Racing Allison Takes Daytona 400: Davey Allison, who took the lead when Mark Martin ran out of gas with five laps left, won the Daytona 400 yesterday for his first Winston Cup victory at Daytona International Speedway at Daytona Beach, Fla. Allison's Ford edged Morgan Shepherd's Pontiac by two car lengths. Phil Parsons finished third and Bill Elliott fourth. Allison's average speed was 132.207 miles an hour. There were 28 lead changes involving 11 drivers in the race, which had a purse of $686,667. Fourteen cars were on the lead lap at the finish, tying the record set in 1986.(AP) Tennis Garner Captures State Title: Chris Garner of Bay Shore, L.I., seeded No. 1, routed No. 2 John Schmitt Jr. of Brookville, L.I., 6-2, 6-1, yesterday to win the New York State clay-court championship at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens. Schmitt, son of a former Jets center, teamed with Gary Cuppernull of Huntington, L.I., to defeat Garner and Howard Endelmen of Roslyn, L.I., 2-6, 7-6, 6-4, in the doubles final. Carol Ann Watson of Jamaica Estates, Queens, upset top-seeded Christina Dragomiescu of Jackson Heights, Queens, 6-2, 6-2, in the women's final.

Han Kiju, an editor for a publishing company in Seoul, South Korea, is a psychologically crippled, impotent man still reeling from a youth misspent as a volunteer infantryman in the South Korean Army's White Horse Division, which fought beside American troops in Vietnam. An uncomfortable reunion with a veteran even more shellshocked than he results in an extended flashback that culminates in a tense, terrifying reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines. There Sergeant Han, who has rejected his war-torn native culture for Western ideals, discovers that the price of survival is the betrayal of human values. For him, the color of the badge worn by the White Horse division becomes the color of death, emptiness, extermination and purposeless annihilation. Of Americans, Sergeant Han says, ''I felt I was watching the fall of a swaggering idol, a boastful giant who had never learned how to live outside his own world.'' ''White Badge,'' which was translated by its author, the South Korean editor and novelist Ahn Junghyo, suffers from stilted dialogue, trite phrasing and an antihero whose lugubrious self-loathing tends to overwhelm the story. It also contains what have become the cliches of the Vietnam novel: a doomed love affair with a Vietnamese peasant girl, depictions of the reptilian cunning of the Vietcong and the neurotic behavior of some of the army's commanding officers. However, the awkward passages do not detract from the book's finale, which occurs years after the war has ended, when a coward who betrayed his fellow troops and injured Sergeant Han returns to beg him for death. The code of combat demands that Han take vengeance, but by the values of Westernized, modern South Korea, he must refuse. His impossible decision becomes the book's despairing end.",1989-07-02T05:00:00+0000

The expansion period dates only from 1961, when the American League went from 8 teams to 10 teams a year before the National League did likewise, through 1977, when the American League went from 12 to 14 teams. In that 17-year span, no first-year team has been worse off the mark than the New York Mets of 1962. In fact, no team since 1900 - expansion, relocated or permanent - has ever lost as many games as Casey Stengel's Mets did that year with their 40-120 record and 10th-place finish in the National League. Oddly, the National League expansion team with the best first-year mark was the Mets' companion newcomer that season, the Houston Colt .45's (now Astros), who won 64 games and lost 96 under Manager Harry Craft. The worst first year for an American League expansion team was the one turned in by the Toronto Blue Jays, who finished at 54-107 in 1977 under Roy Hartsfield.",1989-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Over 16 Years, High Court Has Shaped Abortion Policy","Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's major abortion decisions: JAN. 22, 1973: In Roe v. Wade, the Court for the first time legalized abortion nationwide. It based its ruling on a woman's constitutional right to privacy. The vote was 7 to 2. The Court said a woman's decision to have an abortion in the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. It said states may impose certain regulations in the second trimester to protect the woman's health and may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester. JAN. 22, 1973: In Roe v. Bolton, the Court, voting 7 to 2, struck down restrictions on places that could be used to perform abortions. The decision gave rise to the abortion clinic. JULY 1, 1976: In Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the Court said states could not give husbands veto power over their pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. The vote was 6 to 3. The Court, ruling 5 to 4, also said parents of minor, unwed girls cannot be given an absolute veto over abortions. JUNE 20, 1977: In Maher v. Roe, the Court ruled that states have no constitutional obligation to pay for ''non-therapeutic'' abortions. The vote was 6 to 3. JAN. 9, 1979: In Colautti v. Franklin, the Court affirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion in determining when a fetus can live outside the womb. The Justices said states may seek to protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the determination is up to doctors. The vote was 6 to 3. JULY 2, 1979: In Bellotti v. Baird, the Court elaborated on its parental-consent decision of 1976. It implied that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an alternative procedure, such as letting the minor seek a judge's approval instead. The vote was 8 to 1. JUNE 30, 1980: In Harris v. McRae, the Court said the Federal Government and individual states are under no constitutional obligation to pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare. The vote was 5 to 4. MARCH 23, 1981: In H. L. v. Matheson, the Court ruled that states may require doctors consulted by some girls - those still dependent on their parents and too ''immature'' to decide such matters for themselves - to try to inform parents before performing a requested abortion. The vote was 6 to 3. JUNE 15, 1983: In three decisions, City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City v. Ashcroft and Simopolous v. Virginia, the Court said states and local communities may not require that all abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in a hospital. The court also struck down regulations that, among other things, imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion consent form and the medical procedure. The vote was 6 to 3. JUNE 11, 1986: In Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Court struck down Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it invalidated in 1983. The Court said states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about available benefits for prenatal care and childbirth. The vote was 5 to 4. DEC. 14, 1987: In Hartigan v. Zbaraz, the Court split 4 to 4. The effect was to invalidate an Illinois law that could have restricted access to abortions for some teen-agers. JULY 3, 1989: In a series of votes on Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Court provided states with new authority to limit a woman's right to abortion but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The vote was 5 to 4.",1989-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Remembering Parks Past,"Many of the New York area's amusement centers have been consigned to memory, closed down because of fire, real-estate development or soaring insurance costs. Here is a listing of some of them. VAUXHALL GARDENS, mid-19th century. A summer entertainment area, offering music and theater, that existed briefly near the Bowery. JONES WOOD, late 19th century. Shooting contests and beer halls filled this 150-acre park on the East River between 70th and 75th Streets. SEA LION PARK, 1895-1902. Though started as a trained-seal show by Capt. Billy Boyton, this Coney Island park (north of Surf Avenue) in Brooklyn came to include America's first ''shoot-the-chutes'' ride. PALISADES AMUSEMENT PARK, 1895-1971. This famous New Jersey park, which boasted the world's largest salt-water swimming pool, the first Tunnel of Love and more than 200 other rides and attractions, was opened by the Bergen Traction Company, a trolley line trying to attract riders. The park's 36-acre site overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Lee and Cliffside Park is now occupied by apartment buildings. STEEPLECHASE PARK, 1897-1965. This Coney Island park, owned by the impresario George Tilyou, included one of America's first great Ferris wheels, a cyclorama, Venetian canals and steeplechase, elephant and ''shoot-the-chutes'' rides. Rebuilt after a 1907 fire, it added a Pavilion of Fun that featured a Human Pool Table and Human Roulette Wheel. The now-rusted 260-foot Parachute Jump was moved to Steeplechase after the 1939 World's Fair. There have been recent proposals to build a new Steeplechase amusement park on the site, between Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk, from West 15th to West 21st Streets. ROCKAWAYS PLAYLAND, 1901-1986. This long-running seaside park in Queens (near Beach 97th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard) - built by L. A. Thompson, ''father of the roller coaster'' - included a huge wooden roller coaster and Olympic-size pool. It was sold in 1986 to developers building a condominium complex. LUNA PARK, 1903-1946. Luna Park, noted for its spectacular, fanciful architecture and illusion rides, was built by Frederic W. Thompson and Elmer Dundy on the 22-acre site of Sea Lion Park on Coney Island and is the true precursor of Disneyland. Its most famous rides included a Trip to the Moon, a Trip to the North Pole, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the Canals of Venice, Mountain Torrent and Dragon's Gorge. DREAMLAND, 1904-1911. This Coney Island park (where the Aquarium now stands), built after Luna Park's success, included a Lilliputian Village with 300 midgets, sleighs riding across snow-covered Alps, a 300-foot Tower of Seville and the world's largest ballroom, situated on an ocean pier. FREEDOMLAND, U.S.A., 1960-1964. The most unusual feature of this short-lived park - where Co-op City now stands in the Bronx - was that its physical shape was roughly that of the continental United States. A tableau of reconstructed American history, it included a Civil War battle, Indian settlements, the Chicago fire and the San Francisco earthquake.",1989-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,WHEN WOMEN FINALLY GOT THE WORD,"What does a woman need in order to write? A room of her own and a fixed income, perhaps, but only later on. First she needs a language to write in. But for much of history, East and West, the languages of literature were unavailable to women. Classical languages - Greek and the literary Latin of ancient Rome, an imported Chinese used in early Japan - were once the only written languages that were different from the contemporary spoken tongue, and they were taught almost exclusively to wellborn men. Only an occasional woman - an empress, the daughter or wife of a poet - received this elite education, and thus almost all classical writers were men. But in medieval Japan and Europe, a linguistic phenomenon occurred that broke this classical - and male - monopoly on writing: the development of the written vernacular. What was spoken became what was written. Women began writing in their native languages, and these vernacular works, independent of the classical tradition, prefigured what was to become modern literature.",1989-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"ON THE NATURE OF THINGS EROTIC, by F. Gonzalez-Crussi. (Vintage, $8.95.) F. Gonzalez-Crussi, a very literate pathologist, discourses on love and sex throughout the ages. ''Dr. Gonzalez-Crussi considers courtship, seduction, male jealousy, female deities, lust, desire, satiety, perversion, androgyny,'' Maralyn Lois Polak said in The Book Review last year. ''His erudition is a delight, plundering as he does such diverse sources as Dear Abby, Roland Barthes, Hugh Hefner, Kierkegaard, personal ads and the 14th-century Chinese novelist Shih Nai-an.'' LIBRA, by Don DeLillo. (Penguin, $4.95.) Mixing fact with fiction, Don DeLillo's novel is about a C.I.A. conspiracy to kill President John F. Kennedy and blame Fidel Castro by fingering a Communist dupe named Lee Harvey Oswald. Last year, our reviewer, Anne Tyler, said that this is the richest of Mr. DeLillo's novels, which include ''White Noise'' and ''Ratner's Star.'' ''It is also his most complicated, with a dual slate of characters and a plot line that might be described as herringbone-shaped. Apparently unrelated events slant forward from distant sources to be channeled into a single moment in history: six seconds in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.'' WE ARE NOT AFRAID: The Story of Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney and the Civil Rights Campaign for Mississippi, by Seth Cagin and Philip Dray. (Bantam, $5.95.) The movie ''Mississippi Burning'' gave a highly fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss., 25 years ago. In their book about the case, Seth Cagin and Philip Dray find that the unadorned facts are horrifying enough. ''They trace the fateful day in riveting detail drawn from interviews with civil rights movement veterans, the 1967 trial transcript and thousands of file pages obtained from the F.B.I. under the Freedom of Information Act,'' Henry Mayer said here last year. ''Especially moving are the book's biographical flashbacks, which evoke the personalities of men known principally by their stark mug shots on the F.B.I.'s 'missing' poster.'' In WITNESS IN PHILADELPHIA (Louisiana State University, $9.95), a long-time resident of the town, Florence Mars, with the assistance of Lynn Eden, gives a firsthand account of the turmoil that followed the killings, including her run-ins with the Ku Klux Klan after she testified before a grand jury. ''In view of what befell her and the town she dearly loves, the calm dispassion of her book is all the more impressive,'' one reviewer said in 1977. ''So is her modesty.'' SURVIVING THE SEASONS, by Fern Kupfer. (Laurel/Dell, $7.95.) With two long marriages behind them, a widow and a widower decide to spend what's left of their lives together. '' 'Surviving the Seasons' is an old-fashioned novel about nice people,'' Donovan Fitzpatrick said here in 1987. ''It can be taken also as a moral tale, a handbook on how to make a marriage work through tolerance and understanding - many a marriage counselor could read this book with profit.'' LAST DAYS OF THE SICILIANS: The FBI's War Against the Mafia, by Ralph Blumenthal. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) After Carmine Galante was murdered in a Brooklyn restaurant in 1979, Federal investigators learned of a Mafia within the Mafia, which used a network of pizzerias to launder drug money. Last year, our reviewer, Teresa Carpenter, said Ralph Blumenthal's account of the case has ''narrative drive'' and real-life characters with ''texture and dimension.'' HIGH-TECH SOCIETY: The Story of the Information Technology Revolution, by Tom Forester. (MIT Press, $9.95.) When this primer on the computer revolution was published in 1987, our reviewer, Rob Kling, said it was ''broad ranging and engaging'' and for the most part ''written in amiably fluid prose.'' THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, by James M. Cain. (Vintage Crime, $6.95.) After it was published in 1934, this well-known tale of a drifter who schemes with a waitress to murder her husband was banned for obscenity in Boston. The former newspaperman's first novel ''makes Hemingway look like a lexicographer and Caldwell like a sob sister at her first eviction,'' Harold Strauss said in The Book Review. ''Cain can get down to the primary impulses of greed and sex in fewer words than any writer we know of.'' Published a year later, Cain's next novel, DOUBLE INDEMNITY ($6.95), is a variation on the same theme: an insurance salesman sells a woman a policy on her husband, then helps her kill the man. Vintage has also reissued two other books by Cain. MILDRED PIERCE ($6.95) is about a divorced woman who tries to support her children while staving off unscrupulous lovers. ''It has in it the deep, slow pull of the ancient ooze where worms and serpents crawled,'' Robert van Gelder said here in 1941. THREE BY CAIN ($9.95) contains ''Serenade,'' which is about a love triangle involving an opera singer, a conductor and a prostitute; ''Love's Lovely Counterfeit,'' about a group of gangsters in a Midwestern city; and a story of incest called ''The Butterfly.'' THE GREAT TRIUMVIRATE: Webster, Clay, and Calhoun, by Merrill D. Peterson. (Oxford University, $12.95.) With their oratorical skills, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun dominated American politics for the first half of the 19th century. ''Basing his work on a careful combing of the original sources, [ Merrill D. Peterson ] has made a distinguished contribution to the study of American history,'' Donald B. Cole said here in 1987.

ZEN IS NOW AND NOW IS ZEN In the 17th century, Japanese shoguns withdrew patronage from Zen monks in favor of Confucian scholars; THE ART OF ZEN (Abrams, $39.95) shows what a boon to art this inspired. Freed from the prettifying influence of official commissions, the calligraphy and painting of Zen masters became simple and direct, a form of active meditation. Stephen Addiss, who teaches art history at the University of Kansas, has gathered 117 lovely ''ink traces,'' brushed uncorrected on silk or absorbent paper between 1600 and 1925. Each monk's rendering of a traditional subject - a one-stroke circle, the bug-eyed Zen patriarch Bodhidharma or a simple phrase - is as singular as a thumbprint. In the Zen master Hakuin's ''Blind Men Crossing a Bridge,'' three antlike forms feel their way across a precipice; the calligraphy draws the parallel with unawakened daily life. Mr. Addiss's text illuminates but never overwhelms the art, much of it reproduced in color for the first time. His most detailed description of the process of Zen art describes the painting, in 1916, of a 21-foot banner - now lost - with a five-foot inkbrush. ''Hitching up his robe, 
[

 took up the brush in both hands, splashed it into the bowl of ink, had it squeezed partly dry by an attendant, took a deep breath into his stomach and called out 'Katsu!' . . . the brush moved with the sound 'sa-sa-sa' and droplets of ink splattered on the faces of the onlookers . . . he suddenly kicked the brush with his right foot, splashing the ink all the way up to the ceiling boards of the temple.'' Nantembo's ghostly handprint, surrounded by empty space, below the simple inscription, ''Now listen!'' is one of the last ''ink traces'' in this comprehensive and beautifully executed book.",,1989-07-09T05:00:00+0000

A history of the French Revolution poses two nearly insurmountable ''story problems'': first, in easing the reader through those stodgy early chapters in which the deficit mounts and a series of finance ministers fail to grasp the situation; then, in finding a way to stitch together a coherent narrative from the ragbag of obscure factions, variegated personalities and unaccountable plot turns that make up the later course of events. Olivier Bernier, who has written biographies of Louis XIV and Louis XV and ''Secrets of Marie Antoinette,'' overcomes these difficulties by borrowing the suspense novelist's technique of dramatic rearrangement. After a quick opening account of the first mob invasion of the Tuileries Palace on June 20, 1792, he flashes back to the storming of the Bastille, builds up to the royal family's decision to flee Paris, then jumps back to the start of Louis XIV's reign and the events that led to the forming of the National Assembly. Then he picks up the flight to Varennes and takes the narrative through the trial and execution of Marie Antoinette, after which, says Mr. Bernier, ''the Revolution had essentially run its course.'' In spite of its many-pronged title, then, ''Words of Fire, Deeds of Blood: The Mob, the Monarchy, and the French Revolution'' is mainly the story of the luckless reign of Louis XVI, a man who ''while unable to govern, refused to be less than an absolute king.'' As in a novel, economies are achieved by sharp characterizations. Philippe d'Orleans is an underhanded rogue. Mirabeau is the one man who sees the situation clearly. Lafayette is vain, indecisive, self-seeking. And the King and Queen, in their efforts to spur a counterrevolution, are guilty of deceit and ineffectuality - and of outright treason. Mr. Bernier is highly readable and has a good eye for detail (on the night before his execution, Louis XVI had a supper of ''two chicken breasts and cookies accompanied by Malaga wine''), but the demands put on him by his title leave him with a book thinner and more diffuse than the one he might have written. At the same time, Mr. Bernier is too honest a historian to romanticize his characters, or to sidestep the story problems in a reign symbolized by the King's arrest at Varennes: ''the half-measures adopted too late, the disasters that invariably followed, the invincible lethargy that precluded rapid, effective action.'' This is a well-supported assessment, but as a story line it impedes the very qualities that this book seems to promise: fire and catharsis, the ring of high rhetoric and the shrill of a bloodthirsty mob.",1989-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"PALU. By Louis Nowra. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) In the Australian playwright Louis Nowra's first novel to be published in America, sex, politics and the supernatural determine the fate of a fictional South Pacific nation. President Emo, the country's dictator, has imprisoned his wife, Palu. On sheets of paper smuggled into her cell, she tells her story, which takes her from the bush to a white man's coffee plantation to a teachers' college, where she meets her firebrand husband, to their shared exile in Australia and then to her newly independent country's presidential palace. While the novel revolves around third-world politics, its strongest passages describe the sex-charged system of beliefs that are held by Palu's people. Unfortunately, Emo cannot drag his countrymen into the 20th century. Instead, he becomes convinced that ''his people were incapable of rising above their primitive state.'' As he slides into despotism, he himself is ''swallowed up by his primitive past. . . . His blood stopped flowing and his veins clogged with the ashes of his ancestors.'' Cultural alienation in the developing world remains a rich literary subject, but Mr. Nowra lacks enough sympathy for his characters to make us care about it. He mocks Australian liberals who sought independence for Palu's nation (superficially based on Papua New Guinea), ridicules her countrymen's ignorance of Western culture and derides their efforts at self-government. Mr. Nowra's artless prose, which fails to endow ''Palu'' with a consistent, plausible voice, gives the novel the sullen cast of an imperialist tract.",1989-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Janacek: Glagolitic Mass, 'Taras Bulba' Libuse Domaninska, soprano, Vera Soukupova, contralto, Beno Blachut, tenor, Eduard Haken, bass, Jaroslav Vodrazka, organ, Czech Philharmonic Chorus (Mass); Czech Philharmonic conducted by Karel Ancerl. Supraphon DC-8037; CD only. The Czechoslovak conductor Karel Ancerl left Prague in 1969 for the Toronto Symphony and died in 1973, at 65, without having attained the international acclaim his musicianship merited. His 1963 recording of the Glagolitic Mass is a high point of his discography (and Janacek's), a stunning example of his gift for balancing fervor and finesse. No other performance so fully conveys the fierce, elemental quality of this exuberant pantheist-nationalist manifesto, yet none is more elegantly musical. Mr. Vodrazka and Mr. Blachut are wonderful. ''Taras Bulba'' makes a nice bonus, and the sound stands up well. - Richard Freed Beethoven: Late Piano Sonatas Richard Goode, piano. Nonesuch 79211; two CD's, cassettes and LP's Richard Goode's Beethoven always satisfies though it does not thrill, always explains cogently though it does not make revelations. Throughout this well-played, thoughtful and expressive traversal, one senses the pianist's awareness of the music's many dimensions, senses that he has asked questions and probed the scores. Nothing just goes by, so the playing rings true, but one misses something at the extremes, whether of serenity, tempestuousness or brio. I prefer a more headlong approach in the ''Hammerklavier,'' but otherwise find the shape of Mr. Goode's interpretations persuasive; I also wish for a more singing tone in the lyrical passages - a complaint against a whole generation of current pianists. - Will Crutchfield Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 2 and 4 North German Radio Symphony conducted by Gunther Wand. RCA Victor 60058-2-RC; CD and cassette. Like the previous entries in Mr. Wand's Beethoven cycle, these are solid, carefully laid out, cleanly executed readings, with rhetorical leanings toward Romantic grandeur, not Classic trimness. Still, in both symphonies, Mr. Wand favors the brisk tempos and sharp accents currently in vogue among early-instrument players. He also keeps textures transparent and applies a remarkable dynamic fluidity so logically that even the most personal phrasing twists seem inevitable. The Hamburg orchestra responds with precise, bright string playing, an appealingly acrid wind sound, and good, punchy percussion. - Allan Kozinn Richard Strauss: 'Elektra' Hildegard Behrens, Nadine Secunde, sopranos; Christa Ludwig, mezzo; Ragnar Ulfung, tenor; Jorma Hynninen, baritone; Boston Symphony conducted by Seiji Ozawa. Philips 422 574; two CD's only. Mr. Ozawa's concert version of ''Elektra'' last year received much favorable attention, but this composite document of the November performances in Boston's Symphony Hall is disappointing. While Ms. Behrens makes an exciting, involved title figure, the recording and the role's tessitura expose her raw, unsteady middle register. Ms. Secunde sounds like a provincial German soprano, loud but quavery; Ms. Ludwig is good but past her prime, and Mr. Hynninen makes a lightweight Orest. Mr. Ulfung provides a pungent Aegisth. Mr. Ozawa takes a curiously lyrical view of this hot-blooded score, eliciting many alluring details but undercutting the passion and grandeur. Stick with the Solti-Nilsson version on London. - John Rockwell Johann and Josef Strauss: Waltzes, Polkas, Other Works Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Carlos Kleiber. CBS Masterworks MK2 45564; two CD's, one cassette. Wonderful stuff: a great orchestra in its traditional New Year's romp under a master of the style. Joining the inevitable (''Fledermaus,'' ''Danube,'' ''Radetzky'') and the familiar (''Artist's Life,'' ''Voices of Spring,'' ''Pizzicato Polka'') are a raucous ''Peasant Polka,'' with the orchestra members vocalizing (''singing'' is hardly the word), a lively ''Little Chatterbox,'' a lovely ''Dragonfly'' and other confections. The only issue is whether the buyer, knowing of near-80-minute CD's, will pay full fare for two disks totaling less than 81 minutes of music. (CBS, a representative said, wanted to ''document'' the entire event, yet it provides no notes of any kind.) - James R. Oestreich POP/JAZZ 'Imelda Papin Featuring Songs With Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos' Papin Records (1020 Keeaumoku Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96814). Not known for her modesty, Imelda Marcos here reveals new heights of hubris. She is presented by a younger friend, the Philippine pop star Imelda Papin, who sings ballads in both English and Filipino. If Ms. Papin's clear, neutral vocals don't grate, Mrs. Marcos's four solos (including ''Feelings'') and one duet (Irving Berlin's ''Always'') border on the grotesque. Thin, cheesy arrangements augment the atmosphere of tin-plated sentimentality, as Mrs. Marcos who has wobbly pitch and no sense of rhythm, emotes with an affected tremulousness. Vocally she bears a striking resemblance to another famous wife, Yoko Ono, who at least had the good taste never to record ''Feelings.'' - Stephen Holden Don Henley: 'The End of the Innocence' Geffen 24217; all three formats ''How can love survive in such a graceless age?'' asks the former Eagle in ''The Heart of the Matter,'' which concludes an album whose songs connect personal disenchantment with a social climate of greed, cynicism and selfishness. The theme is announced in the opening title cut, a sweetly flowing folk-rock ballad written with Bruce Hornsby, that reflects sadly on the image versus the reality of the typical American father, as exemplified by Ronald Reagan. Also outstanding are ''New York Minute,'' in which a frenetic urban pace exacerbates the singer's sense that the bottom could drop out of his life at any second, and ''The Last Worthless Evening,'' a ballad of jaded romance. At once boyish and surly, Mr. Henley's singing perfectly underscores the mixture of longing and disillusion. - S.H. Carol Sloane: 'Love You Madly' Contemporary 14049-2; all three formats. Matching Carol Sloane's voice with Art Farmer's flugelhorn was an inspiration. Both lack great reserves of power and rely on a shrewd assessment of their limitations, and pure jazz smarts. They step lightly over bar lines, tying stray phrases together, altering only a few notes to freshen the melody. In her first album in a decade, Ms. Sloane gives much space to her other sidemen: Kenny Barron, Kenny Burrell and Rufus Reid; only Clifford Jordan is slighted. Ms. Sloane shines in ''Love You Madly,'' ''My Gentleman Friend,'' and Blossom Dearie's ''Inside a Silent Tear.'' She can sound too much like Sarah Vaughan, minus the spectacular vibrato, but she is a team player. You can hear these musicians listening to each other. - Richard B. Woodward Mavis Staples: 'Time Waits for No One' Paisley Park 25798; all three formats. The first solo album since 1976 by the Mississippi-born gospel singer was primarily produced by Prince, and its mixture of warm Southern soul-singing and gimmicky Minneapolis studio funk, though not always comfortable, is more harmonious than one might have expected. In the best cuts, like the lovelorn ''Come Home,'' which Prince wrote and produced in a style that deliberately echoes Willie Mitchell's 70's productions for Al Green, he extends himself knowledgeably into Ms. Staples' territory. In other cuts, like ''Interesting'' and ''Jaguar,'' her personality is all but smothered in Princely sound effects. - S.H. Hilton Ruiz: 'Strut' Novus/RCA 3053-2-N; all three formats. Hilton Ruiz once again seems better as accompanist than as star. The rhythm section - his piano, Rodney Jones's guitar, Francisco Centano's electric bass and the percussionists Robby Ameen, Steve Barrios and Mongo Santamaria - consistently lights fires under the soloists, who seldom justify the energy propelling them. The material is often second-rate: ''Goin' Back to New Orleans'' hammers away with a boring funk riff; ''All My Love Is Yours'' is pure corn. Mr. Ruiz goes on too long in his unaccompanied solo on ''Lush Life.''

The versions of the Norse myths with which we are most familiar today are still the romantic 19th-century ones. But each age must find its own truths in ancient lore, and so it is time for a new interpretation of these stories. ''The Downfall of the Gods,'' by the Danish novelist Villy Sorensen, is certainly topical in its approach. Here Odin, the king of the gods, is presented as an enigmatic dictator. The war god Thor resembles a paranoid commander in chief. Balder, god of justice, is a much-admired but ineffectual liberal statesman. Freyr and Freyja, the god and goddess of love, resemble flower children. And Loki, the archetypal trickster, emerges as a modern tragic hero. Outspoken, alienated, he alone sees that both the gods and their enemies, the frost giants, are capable of treachery, and is destroyed because he cannot act as intermediary between irreconcilable forces. Mr. Sorensen's prose, as smoothly translated by Paula Hostrup-Jessen, is fast-paced and economical, often laced with dry humor. The tales are connected by a theme, like chapters in a good novel. From the beginning, we are aware that the escalating militarism of the gods will ultimately cause the destruction of the social order. Thus the saga ends with the apocalypse rather than, as with most versions of the myths, the redemption of the world following the gods' demise, and this makes the book a kind of parable for the nuclear age. Though ''The Downfall of the Gods'' is based on the ''Younger Edda'' of Snorri Sturluson, the 13th-century Icelandic poet, many minor characters from the original have been left out, along with some important material about the major characters. Also missing is a sense of magic and mystery, and the rich, evocative language that gives ancient tales the ability to inspire every new generation with a sense of wonder.",1989-07-09T05:00:00+0000

He also announced that Peace Corps volunteers would be sent to Hungary. A1 A rise in Soviet emigration to the U.S. is expected under a law now being drafted that would lift longstanding restrictions on who can leave the Soviet Union. A1 For the Anglo-Soviet space mission, named Juno, the Soviet Union has turned to the world's largest advertising agency for help in exploiting commercial opportunities. A1 In Eastern Europe, President Bush has seen a world full of contrasts. Where Poland is drab and subdued, Hungary is the opposite. A10 In Hungary, Barbara Bush traveled to Tahitofalu, a village 45 minutes outside the capital to see a Hungarian version of ''a thousand points of light.''

A21 Producing energy with ''cold'' fusion is quite unlkely, and no new facilities should be built by the Government or private groups to study the phenomenon, experts concluded. A1 Prices on soybean futures contracts plunged, the first day after the Chicago Board of Trade issued an emergency order directing buyers and sellers of the contract to liquidate their positions. A1 The House held a seminar on art, with conservative Republicans accusing the National Endowment for the Arts of offending the taxpayers with the taxpayers' money. A18 Rev.

us,Dining Out Guide: Hot and Spicy,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Arizona 206 *** (March 24, 1989), 206 East 60th Street (838-0440) - A source for peerless Southwestern cooking has taken root on East 60th Street in this restaurant where diners indulge a taste for chili-fired creations. Arizona 206's current menu offers appetizers of Southwestern Peking duck with plum mole sauce, and red-chili corn cakes with pumpkin-seed pesto and creme fraiche. Rib eye of lamb, a recommended entree, is nicely smoky and served with a smoldering tomato chili sauce. Among new entrees are achiote pan-seared Louisiana shrimp and crab meat gumbo, and charred split baby chicken with Hatch chili sauce. At lunch, appetizers are $6 to $9, entrees $13 to $18; at dinner, appetizers are $6 to $13, entrees $21 to $27. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Saturday; dinner: 6 to 11 P.M. daily. Bukhara ** (March 17, 1989), 148 East 48th Street, in the Helmsley Middletowne Hotel (838-1811) - Eating with the hands is a tradition encouraged at this restaurant specializing in India's frontier cuisine, which is actually derived from the Pathan people of Pakistan. (Flatware is provided on request.) Many of the dishes are marinated in yogurt, spices and herbs and cooked in a superhot oven, the tandoor. Cubes of lamb, aromatic of ginger and cumin (barah kebab); rolls of minced lamb spiked with hot pepper and cumin (seekh kebab), and a chicken dish (murgh malai) infused with garlic, ginger and potent fresh coriander are good main courses. All tandoor-baked breads are recommended. Appetizers are $3.95 to $4.25, entrees $11.25 to $16.95. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; buffet ($14.95): 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday; dinner: 6 to 11 P.M. daily. Chin Chin ** (Oct. 16, 1987), 216 East 49th Street (888-4555) - The Chin brothers run a stylish and strikingly designed restaurant serving ''uptown'' Chinese cooking with a peppery Sichuan bent. The menu offers such savory items as cold egg noodles in hot sesame sauce; pepper-laced orange beef, and sliced leg of lamb with leeks and chili peppers. Seafood dishes include pan-fried soft-shell crabs in a Sichuan sauce, and jumbo prawns prepared with ginger, garlic, hot peppers and chili paste. Appetizers are $2 to $7, entrees $13 to $18. Open 11:30 A.M. to midnight Monday to Friday and 4:30 P.M. to midnight Saturday and Sunday. Pamir ** (Feb. 13, 1987), 1437 Second Avenue, at 75th Street (734-3791) - There is a mysterious charm to Pamir, a dimly lighted Afghan restaurant where Middle Eastern weavings, soft music and candles set the atmosphere. Coriander, cardamom and green chilies are used in Pamir's cooking, mostly based on lamb and vegetables. Recommended appetizers include scallion and herb-filled turnovers with a yogurt sauce, turnovers made with blazing-hot chili and coriander, and flat ravioli sauced with ground meat, yogurt and mint. Intriguing main courses are pilafs served with lamb stew, one with saffron, orange zest and pistachios and another brown rice, raisins and nuts. Appetizers are $2.75 to $2.95, entrees $9.75 to $14.95. Open 5 to 11 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Closed Monday. Tommy Tang's ** (Dec. 5, 1986), 323 Greenwich Street (334-9190) - Tommy Tang's unorthodox renditions of Thai cuisine and its lively social scene set it apart from many of New York's subdued, family-run Thai restaurants. The best of the dishes are intended to ambush the taste buds with volleys of hot peppers, mint and fresh ginger. Two examples of this complex style are spicy mint noodles with beef, and chili fish - red snapper fillet seasoned with pepper, garlic and Thai red peppercorns that is pan-fried and served with a Serrano chili, ginger and garlic sauce. Appetizers are $4.75 to $14.50, entrees $9 to $22. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 6 to 11 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until midnight Friday and Saturday.

When the National Basketball Association, as expected, approves their purchase last week of the Denver Nuggets, they will become the first black owners of a major American professional sports franchise. Mr. Lee, the architect of the deal who already owns three radio stations, a hair-care company and a Boston television station and had been shopping for a sports franchise, said the purchase was motivated by economics, not posterity. ''If it didn't make economic sense, believe me, we would not be sitting out there having a need to be first,'' Mr. Lee said. ''To the extent that we are, and that we can be used as role models, that we can give hope and inspiration then, fine. It's not a challenge, though. I'm not putting down the gauntlet.''",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000
us,NONFICTION,"SONGS FROM THE ALLEY. By Kathleen Hirsch. (Ticknor & Fields, $22.95.) In ''Songs From the Alley,'' Kathleen Hirsch illuminates the painful, appalling lives of Amanda and Wendy, two homeless women in Boston. Amanda struggles to hold down low-level jobs, fails to resolve unfinished emotional business with her severely disturbed mother and alcoholic, abusive father, finds love with a man who falls ill and dies. Then she succumbs to dependence: ''The city's hidden map of soup kitchens, shelters, and homeless hangouts, and the people she is meeting - all her needs are being met. She has food, clothing, shelter, and more real friendship than she ever knew on 'the outside.' '' But ultimately, Amanda forms a positive relationship with a counselor at a shelter, resumes working and gets placed in a room of her own. Wendy defies happy endings. After a childhood of abuse she turns to drink as a teen-ager and emerges a hopeless alcoholic. In her 30's, she is a haggard wreck. Too disruptive for the shelters, she spends days panhandling change to finance her daily liter of vodka, sleeps on a grate, clings to men whose alcohol-induced viciousness repeatedly lands her in the hospital, battered and slashed. The wretched details are rendered brilliantly, and if Ms. Hirsch had limited herself simply to the two women, this would be a fine, if less ambitious, book. She attempts more, with lengthy chapters tracing the history of social welfare in Boston. They leave the reader more impatient than informed. Are Wendy and Amanda typical? How much are they simply the victims of their own bad luck and character flaws? To what extent has government failed them? Ms. Hirsch, a Boston writer, talks vaguely about the need for a ''holistic approach'' to homelessness, the mobilizing of resources to create ''healthy communities'' and ''owning up to the bankruptcy of some of our dominant social values.'' Amanda, Wendy and the reader deserve better than that.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Radical Transformations,"AROUND MIDNIGHT ON THE EVENING before George Bush's inauguration, a founding member of the New Left made his first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Nineteen years earlier, as a Marxist theoretician and co-editor of Ramparts, the slick journal of the New Left, David Horowitz had tried to bring the anti-war rebellion to a revolutionary boil by publishing a luridly tinted cover photo that showed demonstrators torching a branch of the Bank of America. Now he stood in front of the monument, a stocky, bearded 50-year-old, squeezing back tears as a friend, Wallace Nunn, searched for the names of 12 buddies who had died in Vietnam, where Nunn served as a helicopter gunner. ''I told David this fellow was with me here, that one was there,'' says Nunn, a managing director of Smith Barney and a Republican Party contributor. ''It was a special moment, a coming together.'' For Horowitz, the meeting at the monument symbolized more than a reconciliation with the ''imperialist'' establishment he once sought to overthrow by any means possible. It marked the final stage in a self-imposed political rehabilitation that has grown into a national crusade. Three years ago, the disillusioned ex-radical re-entered the ideological lists with another deserter from the 1960's left, Peter Collier, the Ramparts co-editor with whom he has written best-selling dynastic biographies of the Rockefellers and Kennedys. Together, the two launched the Second Thoughts Project, a kind of peripatetic think tank that promotes the revisionist views of some 20 former radicals who once drafted key New Left texts and led anti-war protests. The project has developed into one of the most spirited anti-left, pro-American campaigns since the lapsed Communist Whittaker Chambers turned on his former comrades in the 1940's.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE DEBT AND THE DEFICIT: False Alarms/Real Possibilities. By Robert Heilbroner and Peter Bernstein. (Norton, $12.95.) This mercifully short economics primer, ''The Debt and the Deficit,'' sets out to prove that neither the United States' national debt nor its annual budget deficit is quite the bogyman that Americans have been led to believe. The debt, contend Robert Heilbroner, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, and Peter Bernstein, a financial analyst, is actually smaller than it was during the 1950's and 1960's, when viewed as a percentage of the gross national product. Nor is it especially large compared to the current debt of other industrialized nations, including that model of thriftiness, Japan. The authors argue that the budget deficit has been vastly exaggerated because of the Government's antiquated bookkeeping methods. While corporations differentiate between current operating expenses and capital expenditures, the Government does not. So, they note, ''all expenditures for whatever purpose - as durable as a dam or as ephemeral as a White House dinner party - are lumped together.'' By setting aside capital spending, adjusting for inflation, subtracting state and local government surpluses and the amount of Federal debt held by the Government itself, Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Bernstein arrive at a deficit for fiscal 1988 of about $3 billion - contrasted with the Government's own figure of $255 billion. If both the debt and deficit are false alarms, is there nothing Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Bernstein would have us worry about? There are several things: the United States' diminished position in the world economy, the ever-present threat of inflation, and the decay of our cities. These are all, the authors point out, problems likely to require Government involvement - and, of course, money.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

The title of this novel by Nettie Jones - spanning the decades between the 1920's and the 1950's - refers to a family of beautiful and adventurous women whose African and American Indian heritage is concealed behind fair-skinned complexions. Raphael De Baptiste is a trained nurse whose color- and class-conscious parents send her away from Detroit to end her love affair with a dark-skinned factory worker. She eventually builds a new life passing as a white woman, and falls in love with a handsome Chippewa Indian. They marry and produce three daughters: Blossom Rose, Lilly and Puma. Raphael dies giving birth to a stillborn son and takes to her grave the secret of her mixed ancestry. Years later, the middle daughter, Lilly, now a teen-ager, learns of her mother's heritage. In her exchange with grandfather De Baptiste about this discovery, however, Lilly expresses no shock, anger or confusion. Instead, Ms. Jones portrays her as immediately elated by the knowledge that she is ''partly Negro, partly white, partly Indian.'' Lilly's response is hard to believe, considering the child's awareness of her father's pride in ''having been married to a 'white' woman'' and his prejudice toward the black fruit pickers who work for him. The author never discloses the reactions of the father and his other daughters to Lilly's news regarding the deception of Raphael, the woman they all loved; they're portrayed as accepting the truth and moving on with their lives. Perhaps Ms. Jones intended her story to leave us with a sense of never having penetrated its surface because the real issue here is the significance of appearance. But the effect is overwhelmingly disconcerting; we are left with a yearning for glimpses of her insight into the emotional lives of these fascinating characters.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

But I thought the value of my gift was determined by the market value of the stock on the date I turned it over. A. You're right, with a few clarifications. ''The general rule for valuing a charitable gift is the date of delivery to the charity,'' says Conrad Teitell, a White Plains tax attorney. Typically, that is the date on which you hand over the actual certificates, signed and completed on the reverse side, to the charity.

Once again a novella arrives from Europe, garlanded with praise (in this case, the 1978 Medicis Prize, for its French translation), trailing the weighty pendant of an epigraph by the French novelist Maurice Blanchot, encumbered by a meticulous index of the locations - in Bombay, Madras and Goa - where each of the 12 brief chapters takes place and confiding in the hoarse whisper of an author's note that ''as well as being an insomnia, this book is also a journey.'' The Italian writer Antonio Tabucchi, who has two collections of short stories translated into English, has achieved a remarkable, though by no means a rare, feat in the 88 pages of ''Indian Nocturne,'' neatly translated by Tim Parks. Mr. Tabucchi's own description of the work - ''this Nocturne in which a Shadow is sought'' - is a diminutive emblem of his miniature achievement. ''Nocturne'' and ''shadow'' are full of vague resonance and romantic suggestion; the capital letters, however, act like a rush of helium and the flimsy abstractions billow up imposingly. Lighter than air in terms of plot and character, ''Indian Nocturne'' has the gravitational field of a black hole when it comes to the portentous, the gnomic, the elliptical. Christine, a traveling acquaintance who makes her living ''photographing wretchedness,'' urges the narrator, over dinner: ''Tell me about your novel, come on. . . . I'm intrigued, don't keep me in suspense.'' '' 'But it's not a novel . . . it's a bit here and a bit there, there's not even a real story, just fragments of a story. And then I'm not writing it, I said let's suppose that I'm writing it.' Clearly we were both terribly hungry.'' You will be, too, minutes after swallowing ''Indian Nocturne.''",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Once More, But With Feeling","Trust the Germans to come through with the precise, pretty phrase to describe any complicated phenomenon, even if it means stringing words together like so many boxcars. I was therefore happy though not surprised to come across, in the the spring issue of Historical Performance (the Journal of Early Music America), the dainty epithet musealer Klangmaterialismus. Borrowed by Denis Stevens, the musicologist and conductor, from the late Hans Redlich, the phrase means a devotion to museumlike sound materials. That devotion, as I have noted several times in this space, has been the life-force behind the historical-performance revival, but also continues to limit the revival's musical importance. Preoccupied with finding and appreciating correct techniques and sonorities in older works, musicians and listeners risk losing contact with the music beneath the piquant surface. This week, as the Mostly Mozart Festival makes the first of several gestures in recognition of the early-music crusade's arrival in the concert mainstream, test yourself: how often are you made aware of the heart-wrenching power that contemporary critics heard in Mozart's or Haydn's music? It is impossible to disentangle sonority from genuine music, of course, and even the most innocent early-music fan would not be guilty of such a crime of abstraction. Nonetheless, the subtler dangers that lurk in musealer Klangmaterialismus need to be understood. In a witty and astute article, Mr. Stevens deplores what he sees as the mindless concentration on historical techniques and sonorities. What he terms ''. . . an unquenchable and insatiable desire for conscious and affected archaism . . .'' still seems to dominate too many period-instrument performances. ''Reading music and performing it may be all very well, but to get to its heart one must see through it, X-ray fashion. Without that ability, which only experience can bring, the most industrious exploiter of ancient instruments is powerless, even ridiculous.''",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

When pressed, the maitre d'hotel informed me that the computer would not accept my card because it was demagnetized and manual processing was not possible ''in computerized France.'' Back home a Visa representative confirmed that complaints do periodically occur and stem from the type of wallet in which the card is carried or from airport security checks. My question is how frequently are travelers inconvenienced and why can't the credit card industry come up with a protective cover? - E. H. B., Easton, Conn. Answer: According to Daniel Brigham, media relations manager of Visa U.S.A., magnetic strips fail about 2 percent of the time. There are various causes, but the type of wallet is not one of them. A rumor that eel-skin wallets can demagnetize a credit card has been disproved and the amount of X-ray at airports is too low, he said. A money clip, however, can cause damage.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"The Boost 1988. HBO Video. 1 hour, 35 minutes. $89.99. Closed captioned. R. This attempted demonstration of the emotional havoc caused by drugs proves far more convincing as a picture of an ephemeral kind of southern California culture. James Woods, as the manic fast-talker Lenny Brown, seems headed for disaster long before he becomes hooked. Once he and his wife (Sean Young) do succumb, this turns into another ''movie about the awful things that addicted people do to themselves and to one another, whether they drink, sniff or shoot up.'' As Lenny's mentor, Steven Hill gives the film's most sophisticated performance. (Vincent Canby) True Believer 1989. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video. 1:43. $89.95. CC. R. This thoroughly gripping film begins with a Chinatown gang murder and makes a powerful impression even before the opening credits are over. Mr. Woods is back - here playing Eddie Dodd, a lawyer whose 60's idealism has given way to the business of defending drug dealers - now ''a fierce and formidable leading man.'' Though narrow and even incomplete, the character of Eddie is a wonderful invention. Robert Downey Jr. and Margaret Colin offer strong supporting performances. Joseph Ruben gives lively and surprising direction to Wesley Strick's tightly knit screenplay. (Janet Maslin) Talk Radio 1988. MCA Home Video. 1:50. $89.95. R. This adaptation of Eric Bogosian's short Off Broadway ''slice of bizarre life'' provides ''a nearly perfect example of how not to make a movie of a play.'' Mr. Bogosian again plays Barry Champlain with a lot of furious energy but no real payoff; though the talk-show host is apparently headed for the junk heap, it's hard to care. Directed by Oliver Stone, this mess of a movie incorporates elements from the real-life story of Alan Berg, the Denver talk-show host murdered in 1984. The story still takes place mostly in one night, but the tension is greatly reduced by a series of spongy flashbacks. (Canby) I Cover the Waterfront 1933. King Bee Video. 1:12. $14.95. Not rated. Adapted from a book by Max Miller and directed by James Cruze, the film is set in San Diego. At the time of its original release, a critic called it ''a stolid and often grim picture, the principal asset of which is the clever acting of the principals'' - particularly Ernest Torrence, in his last performance, as a sinister fisherman who supplements his income by smuggling Chinese into the United States. ''Unusually attractive,'' Claudette Colbert is ''scarcely convincing as a fisherman's daughter, chiefly because she does not look the type.'' Ben Lyon plays a bibulous newshawk who first uses her to learn about her father and then falls in love. The Cocoanuts 1929. MCA. 1:33. $19.95. Not rated. According to a contemporary critic, writing when talking pictures were ''still in their puppyhood,'' ''fun puts melody in the shade in the audible pictorial transcription'' of the musical comedy ''The Cocoanuts,'' featuring ''that incongruous quartet'' the Marx Brothers. Groucho, equipped with George S. Kaufman's crisp lines, ''rather monopolizes things, allowing but scant time for the fair Mary Eaton and her partner, Oscar Shaw, to rhapsodize on love'' to the music of Irving Berlin. Harpo, meanwhile, remains ''content with a silence that has proved golden.'' ''Although the comedy aroused considerable merriment among the first-night gathering, it is of the robust variety, lined here and there by witty words.'' Don't we know.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

And what if Corazon Aquino had come to Washington and Reagan had fallen madly in love with the spunky widow? And what if the pesky Sam Donaldson learned that the President was engaging in hanky-panky with another head of state? Spin all that into a novel and you have ''The Guest of Honor.'' President Matt Underwood, a former television anchorman, is lazy and lacking in curiosity, but he is a handsome and kind man. His wife, Alice, a former Miss America, is beautiful, manipulative and cold. Madame Noy Sang has become the young, inexperienced President of Lampang, an island west of the Philippines, following the assassination of her husband by political enemies. She travels to Washington for financial aid, knowing that, in return, the Americans will want to put a large air base in Lampang. Until his lunch with Madame Noy, the President had not even heard of Lampang. But after seeing her eager face, lissome body and gauzy yellow dresses, he tosses out his 3-by-5 cards and gives her a lot of aid in return for a little base. The trade upsets his chief of staff, Paul Blake. Underwood ignores Blake, sensing that he is under the sway of the First Lady, who likes to conduct meetings with the chief of staff wearing a peach-colored negligee. The President is determined to help Noy find her husband's killer. He is also determined to get re-elected so that he can give her more American aid. This is not just another Washington saga of sex and power. It's a heartwarming tale of two presidents, a vast love and a puny air base.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

''Mr. Suskind, a Munich-born writer whose suspenseful best-selling novel 'Perfume' was published here in 1986, gives us some whiffs of Georges Simenon in this slender but charming rendering of Noel's fateful day,'' Linda Simon said here last year. PRIVATE DEMONS: The Life of Shirley Jackson, by Judy Oppenheimer. (Fawcett Columbine, $10.95.) Rushing through life on alcohol and amphetamines, the woman who wrote ''The Lottery'' seemed so otherworldly that her neighbors in Bennington, Vt., thought she was a Communist or a witch. ''She was a true storyteller, with a rich and haunted imagination, and she could walk unafraid in regions where love and murder have each other's names and speak each other's tongues,'' Elizabeth Frank said in The Book Review last year. ''In 'Private Demons,' Ms. Oppenheimer gives us back both a woman and an artist we should honor.'' ONLY CHILDREN, by Rafael Yglesias. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Two overly driven Manhattan couples learn that having children is even harder than having a career. ''It is heartening to be convinced anew by such a competent writer that parenthood is a worthy subject for literary speculation,'' Brett Singer said here in 1988. WASHINGTON GOES TO WAR, by David Brinkley. (Ballantine, $4.95.) The television journalist recalls how World War II transformed a sleepy city with Southern efficiency and Northern charm into a boom town bureaucracy. ''The history of how bungling old Washington managed successfully to run World War II is told with such endearing detail and sneer-free humor that one concludes it was not in spite of American ineptitude that we won, but because of it,'' Judith Martin said here last year. ALASKA, by James A. Michener. (Fawcett Crest, $5.95.) One thousand seventy-three pages in paperback, James A. Michener's saga about Alaska shows he is ''still, sentence for sentence, writing's fastest attention grabber,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ''It takes him, on the average, about half a paragraph to get you involved in what's happening next, whether it's the development of an ice age, a fight between a mammoth and a saber-toothed tiger or the construction of the Alcan Highway.'' RAINBOWS, CURVE BALLS: And Other Wonders of the Natural World Explained, by Ira Flatow. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) National Public Radio's answer to Mr. Wizard explains how the universe works. ''He presents intricacies of biology, physics and technology much the way Tim McCarver, my favorite New York Mets announcer, discourses on the suicide squeeze play and the mysteries of the balk,'' James Gorman said here last year. SECOND CHANCES, by Alice Adams. (Fawcett, $4.95.) This quiet novel about a group of longtime friends growing old together on the Pacific coast is Alice Adams's strongest work, Benjamin DeMott said in The Book Review last year. ''The strength flows partly from Ms. Adams's capacity to evoke fellow feeling, kindness and devotion as entirely natural inclinations of the heart. Her people care intensely for one another, and, although not beyond rage, seem beyond meanness.'' DISCOS AND DEMOCRACY: China in the Throes of Reform, by Orville Schell. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) In a book published a year before China's latest cataclysm, a Western journalist wonders whether the ancient society can withstand the pressures of modernization. Last year our reviewer, Ian Buruma, criticized Orville Schell for succumbing to ''cultural Maoism.'' But he said that ''his enthusiasm for sifting through material that less diligent reporters might find extraordinarily dull (just try reading a magazine like Red Flag and you will see what I mean) engages the reader.'' PICTURE THIS, by Joseph Heller. (Ballantine, $4.95.)

us,Q&A,"Front-Yard Parking Question: I notice that in my neighborhood and in others around the city, some homeowners have paved over their front yards to use as parking spaces. Sometimes their parked vehicles jut out onto the sidewalk. This detracts from the appearance of the neighborhood. Is it legal to pave over all or part of the front yard for parking purposes? I have heard that a homeowner can only do this if there is a handicapped driver in the family. . . . J. P., Brooklyn Answer: Front-yard parking depends on the zoning of the area in question. The zoning rules that apply to R-1 and R-2 zones, which are mostly detached, single-family homes, for example, would prohibit it. However, in higher-density residential zones that are mostly for rowhouses and small apartment buildings, there are no bans on front-yard parking. Property owners whose buildings are in zones where this type of parking is allowed must meet certain requirements. The main one is that the distance from the front of the building to the property line must be at least 18 feet, and each parking space must be at least 8.5 feet wide. Owners must file plans with the Department of Buildings - in the Plan Examination Section of the borough office. Rights of Shareholders Question: We are 25 percent shareholders in a small co-op in lower Manhattan. Our loft is on the second floor directly above a storefront where there is a legal glass-bending operation. Gas fumes fill our loft and cause headaches and nausea for my husband and me. We have tried to persuade the other shareholders to make the tenant comply with the lease by installing some sort of ventilation system. So far they have refused to act, in part, we believe, because our co-op cannot afford to loseJU the income the rent brings. Can we withhold maintenance in an escrow account to force the co-op to deal with the matter? . . . J. C., Manhattan Answer: No matter how small your co-op or what its financial circumstances, you do have a right to a habitable apartment as the holder of a proprietary lease. Arthur Weinstein, an attorney who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said the courts have consistently held that the warranty of habitability applies to co-ops as well as rentals. Start by making your complaint and legal position clear in a certified-mail letter to the co-op board. You might substantiate the fact that a serious condition exists by filing complaints with the city's Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Buildings. The possible violations being caused by the tenant would pose a greater risk than the loss of your maintenance.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

In response to negative reviews, the playwright can sulk, grumble, complain by telephone or mail - or he can write a play about the experience. That last recourse has been taken by, among others, Peter Nichols, Terrence McNally, A. R.

us,FICTION,"UTRILLO'S MOTHER. By Sarah Baylis. (Rutgers University, $18.95.) As the subject of her only adult novel - she previously wrote two books for children - the British writer Sarah Baylis (who died in 1987) chose the life and times of the French artist Suzanne Valadon (1867-1938). Born in the provinces, Valadon at a young age moved to Paris with her mother and soon began to model for the artists who frequented the cafes of Montmartre. At 15, she began to draw. That same year she gave birth to Maurice Utrillo, arguably the most monstrous of painters. Valadon's work impressed many of the artists for whom she modeled, foremost Degas. ''This devil,'' he said of her, ''has a genius for drawing.'' Hot-tempered and fiercely independent, she probably was the devil to many of the mediocre artists of the time. Ms. Baylis wrote from Valadon's perspective, in the first person, and most of the story is devoted to Valadon's early years, from about the age of 6 to 20. The author was very good indeed at recreating the ambiance of life in the rural France of 100 years ago. She was a writer of all the senses; smells, sounds and tastes are a fundamental part of her vision, and are rendered with great verve. Ms. Baylis could make the reader truly feel for this defiant, unquestionably talented person. But ultimately her Suzanne Valadon seems merely a vehicle for projecting an antimale polemic. This is a book where all men are dull, selfish or cruel, and where no man, save Degas, is capable of truly rendering the female figure. And even he, in his only appearance, is shown as a whining old man. While there are many good things in this book, one keeps thinking how much better it could have been had there been more show and less tell.",1989-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Remember that Oriental poppies disappear after they have bloomed and formed a collar of foliage; do not disturb the roots. Replant If soggy growing weather, insect pests or improper planting have caused gaps in the flower borders, by all means fill them in.

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT The Group of Seven summit meeting ended with an appeal for ''decisive action'' to protect the environment, signaling a shift to a new area of concern. The leaders also endorsed a U.S. plan on third-world debt, expressed confidence in the general state of the world economy and agreed to set up a task force to fight the laundering of drug profits. [ Page A1. ] This time, few of the summit leaders' prescriptions for the world economy were made in the U.S.A. Unlike Ronald Reagan, who had notions of free markets and small government that the six other countries eventually bought, President Bush gave some ground when U.S. allies rejected his proposals. [ A6. ] COMPANIES Wall Street was divided on the impact of a Delaware court's refusal to block Time's takeover of Warner. Some said the ruling might make it easier for managers to thwart takeovers and focus on long-term issues. Others contend that the refusal to block Time's offer for Warner was unfair to shareholders. [ D1. ] Delaware's Supreme Court is considered unlikely to overturn the decision. [ D2. ] Prudential Securities was working toward an agreement to buy the retail offices and customer accounts of Thomson McKinnon for about $120 million. An agreement to acquire all of Thomson was terminated last week after an examination of its books. [ D1. ] THE ECONOMY Ginnie Mae's growing losses may have resulted from a lack of supervision, H.U.D. officials and auditors' reports say. The situation illustrates an emerging theme of H.U.D. in the Reagan Administration: that inadequate oversight, combined with more reliance on private parties to regulate their extensions of credit, has produced billions of dollars of Government losses. [ D1. ] The real battles over tax-law changes begin this week. Virtually all the changes that Ways and Means Committee members would like to make would cost the Government revenue. [ D2. ] INTERNATIONAL REPORT Sir James Goldsmith's bid for B.A.T. has stirred London. It is the first time its financial community has witnessed either a huge leveraged buyout offer or the large-scale use of ''junk bonds.'' [ D1. ] ''El Big Bang'' promises to radically change Spain's equities markets. The second stage of the reforms include a code of ethics and the end of a system of exclusive stockbroker rights. [ D8. ] Bank chairmen met in New York to discuss the final elements of a debt reduction and restructuring package for Mexico. [ D8. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS A Denver bookstore is considered a symbol of the resurgence of independent bookstores. The Tattered Cover has often been called the best general bookstore in the United States. [ D1. ] Thomson's efforts to acquire a small Illinois newspaper have been frustrated by a dissident member of the family that owns it. The fight for control of The Register-Mail in Galesburg is being cast as a David vs. Goliath effort to maintain local ownership. [ D9. ] Local TV news has become a growing rival to entertainment shows in the battle for viewers. A Los Angeles station is planning to introduce the nation's first three-hour local newscast. [ D9. ] Fox is attracting the young viewers that advertisers want, and it expects a ''substanial profit'' in the next year. Television. [ D9. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS New arbitrage rebate regulations are too burdensome, bond issuers and trade groups say, and will cost state and local governments far more for compliance than the Federal Government will receive in rebates. Tax Watch. [ D2. ] Credit market participants face the prospect of a huge supply of long-term bonds that could push up yields. Credit Markets.

Camacho stopped Hanks in his tracks with a right hook and then answered his opponent at every chance, using his speed and a quick jab to control the fight. There were no knockdowns. The judges, Frank Cairo and Richard Murray, scored the fight 100-90 for Camacho, while Eva Shain had it 99-91 for Camacho.

The victory yesterday, which came after Tim Simpson missed a 30-foot birdie putt, was worth $153,000 to the 34-year-old Donald. Darkness forced a postponement of the playoff on Sunday night after Donald and Simpson eliminated Hal Sutton on the third playoff hole, where Sutton made a double-bogey 6, and they each carded a 4. Yesterday, both players put their drives in the fairway. Donald, hitting first, landed his approach 7 feet from the pin, and Simpson landed 30 feet away. As the players walked on the green, a light rain began to fall, and Simpson, after lining up his birdie attempt, left it 4 feet short. Donald then knocked in the winner.(AP) CYCLING Longo Regains Lead Jeannie Longo of France regained the lead of the women's Tour de France yesterday by winning an individual time trial.

The match was suspended on Sunday with Broad and Kruger leading by 5-2 in the first set, and then moved indoors yesterday. Broad held serve when play resumed to win the first set. In the second set, both teams held serve until the 12th game, when Kruger double-faulted four times. In the third set, Galbraith and Garrow took a 4-1 lead en route to their first pro championship.(AP) HORSE RACING Bally Blue Triumphs: Bally Blue, carrying 112 pounds under Jerry Bailey, surged to the lead nearing the stretch and then drew away for a decisive 10 3/4-length victory in the $47,000 Western Warrior Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont Park yesterday.

[ Page A1. ] Some of Japan's most sophisticated equipment for making computer chips was illegally diverted to East Germany by a company that is also suspected of sending nuclear material to the Soviet bloc, investigators disclosed. [ D1. ] ECONOMY The trade deficit in May was the largest in five months, the Commerce Department reported.

The 1943 serial of the Caped Crusader and 80 of both the most famous and least known fantasy and science-fiction feature films, are being shown through Sept. 21 at Film Forum 2, 57 Watts Street. This seemingly all-encompassing Summer Festival of Fantasy, Horror and Science Fiction will include such movies as Robert Wiene's ''Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' Werner Herzog's ''Nosferatu,'' a high-tech Japanese animated feature called ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'' and the Dr. Seuss fantasy ''The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.'' The opening work in the series, ''Carnival of Souls,'' a 1962 cult film by Harold Harvey about an auto-accident survivor pursued by a ghoulish-looking man, runs through tonight, with Jacques Tourneur's ''Curse of the Demon'' (1962) and the first of 15 chapters of ''Batman'' on the bill. The festival -which will be Film Forum's last before it moves to a new theater in SoHo early next year - will also include such 3-D classics as ''Creature From the Black Lagoon'' (Tuesday and Wednesday), ''House of Wax'' (Aug. 4 to 7) and ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (Sept. 19 to 21), and theater seats will be wired to re-create the 1950's audience-tingling gimmick known as Percepto for screenings of ''The Tingler'' (Aug. 4 to 10).

Otherwise, wash with soap and water, make a hole at the base with a sterlized needle, drain, and apply a sterile dressng. If the blister is already broken, wash, bandage, and watch for infection. Poison ivy, oak, sumac: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash exposed areas with soap and water, and apply rubbing alcohol. Use soothing lotion like calamine until condition runs its course, usually in two to three weeks. If rash is severe, see a doctor. Bee stings: Remove the stinger with tweezers, or scrape it away with a credit card, Wash with soap and water, and apply cold to reduce swelling and pain. Call an ambulance if hives, nausea, vomiting, widespread swelling, labored breathing or dizziness develop.

Boston Five Classic yesterday at Danvers, Mass., with Penny Hammel, Shirley Furlong and Cathy Marino. All were at eight-under-par 136, one stroke ahead of Beth Daniel and two ahead of Kathy Postlewait and Cindy Rarick. Alcott, seeking her 28th victory in 15 years on the tour but without a victory this year, was pleased with her second straight 68 despite missing a chance to take a two-stroke lead. Alcott had cleared a large pond and was about 30 yards from the hole in two shots on the 485-yard, par-5 final hole. Her pitch hit the pin, then the cup, but rolled about six feet away. She missed the putt that would have given her a one-stroke lead. Hammel, who shared the first-round lead with Postlewait at five-under 67, shot 69 yesterday. Marino matched her career-best of 67 and Furlong had a 66. (AP) Byrum Is in Hunt: Curt Byrum, looking for his first victory in seven years on the PGA Tour, beat the wind and rain to finish with a three-under-par 67 yesterday and take the second-round lead in the Hardee's Classic in Coal Valley, Ill. Byrum, who shot a 66 Thursday, had three birdies and played his second straight bogey-free round. He finished just before a storm hit the Oakwood Country Club course. The foul weather, a constant on the PGA Tour this year, suspended play for more than an hour in the late afternoon. Showers also delayed the start of the round for an hour. Byrum's seven-under 133 total was a stroke better than the defending champion, Blaine McCallister, and Greg Ladehoff. McCallister had a 69, his sixth stright sub-par round at the Hardee's tournament, while Ladehoff, from nearby Clinton, Iowa, had a score of 65. (AP) Unexpected Co-leader: Chick Evans, a last-minute entrant, birdied six straight holes on the back nine yesterday for a six-under-par 66 and a share of the first-round lead in the first Ameritech Senior Open in Cleveland. The co-leader is Dick Ryhan. Evans, who has never won on the PGA Senior Tour, was not in the 72-player field originally; he did not find out he was playing until Bob Goalby dropped out Tuesday night. His birdie string is the longest on the Senior Tour this season. Evans, 44th in winnings this year with $44,643, was even par on the 6,615-yard, par-72 Canterbury Golf Club after missing a five-footer for birdie on No. 11. But he hit a pitching wedge to 6 feet and sank a birdie putt at 12, followed with a two-putt birdie on the par-5 13th hole and then hit a pitching wedge to within 2 inches of the cup on 14 for another birdie. He sandwiched 35-foot putts for birdies at 15 and 17 around a 4-footer on No. 16 to run his streak to six. His string was broken on the final hole when his 20-foot birdie putt hit the cup and spun out. Charles Coody, a former Masters champion, and Harold Henning were one shot back at 67. (AP) TENNIS Garrison Advances: Top-seeded Zina Garrison led an advance of four seeded players into the semifinals of the $200,000 Virginia Slims of Newport tournament last night in Rhode Island. Garrison, ranked fifth in the world, beat Michelle Jaggard of Australia, 6-4, 6-1. She will face eighth-seeded Gigi Fernandez of Miami, who beat Laura Gildemeister, 6-3, 6-3.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL American Songs: Works by Paul Bowles, Lee Hoiby, Richard Hundley, Eric Klein, John Musto and Virgil Thomson William Sharp, baritone; Steven Blier, piano. New World NW 369; CD and LP. Lovers of the American art song have had a good year - first Jan DeGaetani's stunning ''Songs of America'' (Nonesuch 79178) and now this. Mr. Sharp has selected 24 songs written between 1935 and 1987, all tonal, consonant and lyrical. His lightness and purity of tone, clarity of diction and sensitivity to both textual and musical values make the entire collection a joy to explore, but the real discovery is a group of 11 songs by Paul Bowles. Now better known as a writer than as a composer, Mr. Bowles creates lilting, bluesy melodies, perfectly wedded to the cadences of everyday speech. His songs are an absolute delight. - K. Robert Schwarz Mozart: Piano Sonatas (K. 310, 332, 576) and Other Works Aleck Karis, piano. Bridge BCD 9011; CD and cassette. A fine young pianist with a varied repertory concentrates his efforts here on a cornucopia of Mozart: three great sonatas, the C minor Fantasy, the D major Rondo and three exquisite trifles - 77 minutes of sublime music, attractively rendered. Though playing a modern Steinway, Mr. Karis never storms the heavens. Even in the blustery moments of K. 310 and the Fantasy, he shows great restraint, though never losing energy and tautness. In K. 332's slow movement, his liquid legato occasionally produces a diffuse sonority somewhat akin to the glass-harmonica simulation of the concluding K. 617a Adagio, but on the whole, Mr. Karis's interpretations are most appealing - imaginative, supple and varied. - James R. Oestreich Richard Strauss: Songs Anton Dermota, tenor; Hilde Konetzni, soprano; Alfred Poell, baritone; Richard Strauss, piano. Preiser CD 93261; CD only. Round about his 80th birthday, in 1943, Richard Strauss taped some 40 songs in Vienna with singers who had appeared in his operas there. This CD offers 16, including several favorites. Let's hope the rest are on the way; these are most enjoyable and informative. The singing is not fabulous, but Dermota's tone is sweet, and Poell shows surprising suppleness and rhythmic alacrity. Several other pianists have played the songs with more virtuosity, though Strauss is never less than respectable; the wonderful thing is the way the playing gives the idea behind the score: a sense of dramatic tension when a new figuration appears, an accelerando that clarifies the point of destination, something in the pointing of the rhythm. . . . Must listening for all with more than a passing interest in Lieder. - Will Crutchfield Grieg: Symphony in C minor and Other Works Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Deutsche Grammophon 427 321; CD only. Grieg composed his symphony at 20, fresh out of the Leipzig Conservatory. After a few performances, he withdrew it in 1867, forbidding all future performances (an injunction honored until 1981). Why the secrecy? The ardent nationalist had written a tiptop German symphony, orthodox in style and lacking the slightest glimmer of the Northern Lights he strove thereafter to capture. Though not particularly individual, it is energetic and fresh-sounding. More striking and characteristic are the other works here, the overture ''In Autumn,'' the ''Old Norwegian Romance'' and the ''Funeral March in Memory of Nordraak.'' All are played splendidly under Mr. Jarvi. - Barrymore L. Scherer Symphonies Nos. 1-3, 'Pro et Contra,' 'Perpetuum Mobile' Frans Helmerson, cello; Bamberg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Bis CD-434; CD only. Today Arvo Part's music is admired for its spiritual repose, its hushed stasis and its almost minimalist simplicity. But before his study of medieval music in the early 70's, Mr. Part was a very different composer. All the works recorded here were written during the years between 1963 and 1971, when Mr. Part eagerly explored avant-garde techniques - ranging from serialism, ''chance'' music and quotation to coloristic densities that recall his fellow East Europeans Ligeti and Penderecki. But it is the unremitting savagery and dramatic thrust of these early works that is most surprising. Only the Symphony No. 3 (1971), absorbed in medieval and Renaissance polyphony, hints at the future. The performances are vigorous and deeply committed. - K.R.S. POP/JAZZ Sarah Brightman: 'The Songs That Got Away' Polygram 422-839116; all three formats. The selections in this astutely chosen collection of mostly little-known theater songs include such gems as ''Meadowlark'' from ''The Baker's Wife,'' and ''I Remember'' from the early Sondheim show ''Evening Primrose.'' Also included are songs from the English musicals ''Bless the Bride,'' ''The Crooked Mile'' and ''Jeeves,'' the last (''Half a Moment'') with music by the singer's husband, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Miss Brightman's light-operatic style epitomizes the formal, nonidiomatic approach to musical-comedy songs typical of British theater singers. Her voice is pretty but often thin in texture and occasionally too piercing. Instead of communicating passion and verve, Ms. Brightman maintains a tone of elevated decorum that is agreeable but ultimately proves unexciting. - Stephen Holden Al Green: 'Too Much Joy' A&M 5228; all three formats. Al Green, one of America's finest singers, left secular soul music for gospel in the mid-70's, but he still glances over the borderline. ''Too Much Joy'' juxtaposes older, tambourine-beating gospel and slow-building hymns with Mr. Green's own loping Memphis funk and a few fairly trendy, synthesizer-tinged modern arrangements. Yet while ''You Are My Everything'' could be interpreted as a secular love ballad, most of the album makes its pious message clear. Mr. Green's voice, gliding and curving and soaring around the lyrics as if in a private reverie, is the sound of a lone supplicant, gently testifying to the comforts of faith. - Jon Pareles Nashville All-Stars: 'After the Riot at Newport' Bear Family; CD and LP (Sunshine Records, 508 Colorado Avenue, Stuart, Fla. 34994). In 1960, George Wein invited a group of Nashville studio musicians - Boots Randolf on saxophones, Hank Garland and Chet Atkins on guitars, the 17-year-old Gary Burton on vibes, and others - to the Newport Jazz Festival. The festival was canceled because of rioting, so instead of playing onstage, the band recorded an album, which until this reissue has been extremely rare. The performances - which the musicians, according to Rich Kienzle's terrific liner notes, disavow - are satisfactory and then some. Relaxed and swinging, it's classic be-bop-influnced jazz. And with a handful of solos by Brenton Banks, a violinist and pianist, and Mr. Garland, one of the greatest jazz guitarists ever, the album becomes more than a well-meaning footnote to jazz history. - Peter Watrous 'Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe' Arista AL85-90126; all three formats It's a tough, mostly futile search for melodies on the putative debut album by Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe - the singer, drummer, keyboardist and guitarist, respectively, from the most popular lineup of the British band Yes. (Other former members hold the Yes band name trademark.) The Yes-men still dispense multipart songs featuring Mr. Anderson's piping voice and nebulous homilies (''We hold our hands together / Be the sunshine''), Mr. Wakeman's quasi-classical pomp, Mr. Howe's high filigrees and Mr. Bruford's fluency in odd meters. ''Teakbois'' attempts French Antillean zouk, laughably, but the Yes-men mostly parody their older work with busy, virtuosic, glowingly recorded filler. - J.P. Babyface: 'Tender Lover' Solar FZ45288; all three formats. There is much satisfaction to be derived from the skillful working of a genre, and this is nothing if not genre music. Babyface (Kenny Edmonds), who along with his partner L. A. Reid, is one of pop's more successful producers and songwriters, has a nice melodic touch; surprising, lithe melodies sneak out from around corners. Otherwise he follows the rules of silken black pop, with overtones of Prince and Michael Jackson. Love songs, of the basically dumb variety, let Babyface's thin voice quiver and shake a bit. With lots of synthesizer gloss, it's music of opulence, and clarity; his melodies snake their way through rolling bass lines. Originality, or depth, isn't the point; Babyface writes perfect songs of the genre, slightly anonymous but delivering the pleasure they're supposed to, until the next hit. - P.W.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

McCallister, who was the first-round leader with a five-under 65, shot a 67 for a 54-hole total of nine-under 201. That put him a stroke ahead of Curt Byrum, John Adams and Lonnie Clements, all of whom are looking for their first victory on the PGA Tour. Byrum shot a 69 for 202, while Adams and Clements fired 67's. McCallister rolled in a 20-foot putt from the edge of the green on No. 14 and holed a 35-footer with a chip shot from the rough on No. 16 to go 10 under par. He bogeyed No. 17, but finished with six birdies and three bogeys. McCallister has an opportunity to become the first player to defend his title successfully since Deane Beman, now the PGA commissioner, won in 1971 and 1972, when the tourney was called the Quad Cities Open.(AP) One-Stroke Lead for Henning: Harold Henning shot a four-under-par 68 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the Ameritech Senior Open in Cleveland.

Hall of Fame, was at 12-under 204 on a day when her top competitors could not match her consistency. Shirley Furlong birdied the last two holes after bogeying the 16th and finished with 70 for a 206 at the 6,008-yard, par-72 Tara Ferncroft Country Club course.

us,NONFICTION,"POETRY AND THE WORLD. By Robert Pinsky. (Ecco, $19.95.) Robert Pinsky, who confesses in ''Poetry and the World'' to ''a kind of pitying mistrust toward all literary criticism,'' nonetheless brings his distinguished credentials as a man of letters to bear on that double cosmos of his title. Academia today requires that a batch of essays like this one - all the pieces have been previously published, in a variety of contexts - insist on its integral status as a book, rather than a collection. Readers will find instruction and delight richly mixed in his jargon-free analyses. The author's sensitivity, as a distinguished practicing poet, to poetry's social issues - not so much of subject matter as of audience - leads him to brilliant illuminations of idiom, tone and range of diction in (mostly) American poetry. Trust his literary introductions; to read with him Philip Freneau's ''Indian Burying Ground,'' Marianne Moore's ''Steeple-Jack,'' E. A. Robinson's ''Eros Turannos'' or Frank O'Hara's ''Ave Maria'' is to savor the fine precision of response that our modern critics tend, habitually and regrettably, to devalue. Generalizations, now in critical ascendancy, also appear: ''The act of judgment prior to the vision of any poem is . . . a resistance or transformation of communal values'' or '' [ as ] the art that pulls verbal abstraction into its bodily frame, poetry is the most insistently physical art.'' If the arguments that sustain these broad assertions are less urgent and eloquent than Mr. Pinsky's close readings, yet they widen our reflection. Even the autobiographical digressions demonstrate a heartening sense of vocation. Mr. Pinsky's honorable practice confirms the dignity and creative dimension of, in Matthew Arnold's prescient formulation, the function of criticism at the present time.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Since his ''Vampire Lesbians of Sodom'' opened in 1985 at the Provincetown Playhouse (where it is still running), the 34-year-old playwright had ribbed Off Broadway with such irreverent works as ''Psycho Beach Party,'' ''Times Square Angel'' and ''Theodora, She-Bitch of Byzantium.''",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,CHILDREN'S BOOKS/HISTORY,"THE WAR AT HOME. By Connie Jordan Green. (Margaret K. McElderry, $12.95. Ages 8 to 12) There is more than one battle raging in Connie Jordan Green's novel, but the one with the most impact on her 13-year-old heroine, Mattie McDowell, is the war with the Japanese. The time is 1944, and Mattie and her family have moved from Kentucky to Oak Ridge, Tenn., where Mr. McDowell has been assigned a top-secret job. Ms. Green vividly portrays the mystery of the newly created town and also its claustrophobia, which resulted from families cramped into small, boxy houses. That trapped feeling is heightened for Mattie when her cousin, Virgil, comes to spend several months with her family. Although the novel then focuses on private wars - Mattie squabbling with Virgil, Virgil fending off a school bully, the boy's n'er-do-well father trying to regain control over him - the reader never loses the sense of the real purpose behind Oak Ridge. Unfortunately, Ms. Green's attempts to deal with the ethical issues she poses are less successful. Mattie and Virgil make their peace, but neither has fully thought out their differences, many of which revolve around the appropriate use of violence. This is a shame, since the 1940's presented the greatest moral dilemma of our time: Does ending a war justify killing millions of civilians with a nuclear weapon? But although ''The War at Home'' raises more questions than it answers, Ms. Green conveys both a sense of the period and the conviction that ethical decisions are not always easy or clear-cut.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"NOTHING BUT THE BEST: The Struggle for Perfection at the Juilliard School, by Judith Kogan. (Limelight Editions, $10.95.) Judith Kogan, a lawyer and harpist who graduated from Juilliard, tells of cutthroat competition at her alma mater. ''She's a shrewd storyteller with a good eye for emotionally charged detail, and her narratives of orchestral mutiny and precompetition jitters are deliciously real,'' Kyle Gann said here in 1987. ''Former music students will cringe with recognition; others will find a fascinating, Upton Sinclair-type expose on how musical artists are made.'' WHERE I'M CALLING FROM, by Raymond Carver. (Vintage, $8.95.) When he died last year of cancer at the age of 50, Raymond Carver left behind this collection of new and selected short stories - stark, often haunting tales that will now have to stand as his life's work. ''His impulse to simplify is like an attempt to create a hush, not to hear less but to hear better,'' our reviewer, Marilynne Robinson, said in 1988. ''Mr. Carver is rather like the poet William Carlos Williams, who declared there were 'no ideas but in things,' and who turned banality's pockets out and found all their contents beautiful.'' THE CHALLENGE, by A. B. C. Whipple. (Quill/Morrow, $12.95.) Before steam supplanted wind as the preferred means of propulsion for cargo ships, two clippers called the Challenge and the Flying Cloud raced around Cape Horn. This ''spirited history of the clipper era [ is ] one of those rare books whose chapter notes are as much fun as the text,'' Tony Gibbs said here in 1987. ''If at times Mr. Whipple's prose is a shade fervid, he never falls into the trap of romanticizing what he describes.'' THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW, by Walter Wangerin Jr. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) In an ancient world where the earth is the focus of the celestial spheres, a group of talking animals has been recruited by God to fight an apocalyptic battle against pure evil, a subterranean serpent named Wyrm. The same publisher has also reissued THE BOOK OF SORROWS ($8.95), the sequel to Walter Wangerin Jr.'s 1978 allegory. ''In his two-volume fable, Mr. Wangerin is writing nothing less than a parable of the Fall, an attempt, if not to justify God's ways to man, then to ask God to do so Himself,'' Michael Malone said in The Book Review in 1985. ''Like its predecessor, with which it should be read, 'The Book of Sorrows' is a profoundly imagined and beautifully stylized fable of the immemorial war between good and evil.'' CHAIM WEIZMANN: A Biography, by Norman Rose. (Penguin, $14.95.) Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952), the first President of Israel, left behind more than 20,000 letters when he died, the first one written when he was 10 years old. By drawing on these and other writings, Norman Rose ''provides a fluent and readable account of the career of this immensely gifted, endlessly fascinating, creative statesman,'' Bernard Wasserstein said here in 1986. PINBALL, by Jerzy Kosinski. (Arcade/Little, Brown, $8.95.) A beautiful drama student sets out to find Goddard, an elusive rock star who seems to exist only through his music. Jerzy Kosinski ''has created a suspenseful, readable, and unsentimental tale that showcases his love for and knowledge of music and examines the nature of fame and success and the frightening alienation and violence it often spawns,'' one reviewer said in 1982. Arcade has also republished BLIND DATE ($8.95), the story of George Levanter, a businessman, murderer and rapist who travels the world meting out his own weird justice. Mr. Kosinski ''wants to entertain Sade-wise readers who won't blanch at a highly literary treatment of violence and perversion,'' a reviewer said in 1977. KATHERINE MANSFIELD: A Secret Life, by Claire Tomalin. (St. Martin's, $13.95.) Katherine Mansfield, who succumbed to tuberculosis at the age of 34, gained a reputation among friends like D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf as an unstable woman given to extravagant lies. ''Because Mrs. Tomalin has put the tangled facts of Mansfield's life together with intelligence and detachment, and because she has a flair for inspired guesses, she has eloquently justified a new telling of a sad old story,'' Pearl K. Bell said here in 1988. AMRITA: Or To Whom She Will, by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's first novel, which is about star-crossed young lovers in modern India, is ''an amusing, slightly caustic comedy,'' Santha Rama Rau said in The Book Review in 1956. The same publisher has also reissued GET READY FOR BATTLE ($7.95), her novel about a middle-class family in Delhi. The author ''views her characters with a coruscating eye,'' one reviewer said in 1963. ''She deftly pinpoints her situations and characters with an economy of words.'' A HISTORY OF VENICE, by John Julius Norwich. (Vintage, $14.95.) John Julius Norwich fell in love with Venice on a trip there with his family when he was 16 years old. His history of the city is ''complete, accurate, elegantly written and easily readable by nonspecialists,'' Luigi Barzini said in The Book Review in 1982. FAMILIARITY IS THE KINGDOM OF THE LOST, by Dugmore Boetie. Edited by Barney Simon. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $6.95.) This short life story of an uneducated thief with a soaring imagination is ''a flight of wild comic exaggeration and invention that is not only vibrantly funny but a more honest expression of the despair of black South Africans than any number of moralizing exhortations,'' our reviewer, Joseph Lelyveld, said in 1970.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Officials of Fannie Mae, as the nation's largest investor in home mortgages is known, said a key change in their regulations is the use of the original appraisal for the refinancing if the refinancing involves the same lender. This would mean a savings of several hundred dollars. Fannie Mae also eased the income and credit verification requirements by considerably reducing the amount of personal financial records needed to support the refinancing request, and changed some eligibility standards so that many borrowers will find it easier to requalify for the new mortgage.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE WOMEN WHO WALK. By Nancy Huddleston Packer. (Louisiana State University, $17.95.) Painted in ''swirls of blood and milk,'' the carefully rendered family studies in Nancy Huddleston Packer's second book of stories examine the quiet violence of everyday life, tracing the emotional tightropes we all learn to walk and the nets we dive into as we fall. In ''The Women Who Walk,'' characters hoard their relationships to one another, alternately cherishing and tearing at the painful bonds of intimacy as the ordinary clang of kitchen pans and the rustle of silk punctuate the emotional landscape. The best pieces in the collection are anatomies of aftermath: failed relationships echo with the hollow ache of lost chances; parents sit their children down and haltingly attempt to interpret the inexplicable. In the title story, a woman struggles to reinvent herself after the demise of her marriage, reeling from the loss, grasping desperately at sources of strength. Another story, ''Making Amends,'' chronicles the meeting of two former lovers 20 years later; as they spar again, one flirts with involvement and pines for a second chance while the other yearns mutely for retribution. Most of the narrators in this book are women, many of whom share a stubborn intelligence and blind resilience, a determination based not so much on faith as on instinct. Prepped for pain, still somehow willing to risk everything in pursuit of ever-elusive emotional connections, the characters in Ms. Packer's thoughtful stories go about the quiet heroism of simply being human.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Written in 1972, this energetically satiric novel by Vassily Aksyonov went unpublished in the Soviet Union and saw print in the United States in a Russian edition only after the author immigrated to this country in 1980. It's hard to understand what irked the censors about this witty but fairly unsubversive tale of life in Ironburg, a mythical science institute hidden deep in Siberia. Perhaps the sheer vigor of its rapid-fire invention was enough to turn the thumbs down; then too, the novel's unconventional, free-floating narrative structure couldn't have been a plus. Mr. Aksyonov ranges at will through the minds and dreams of some half-dozen scientists and their wives, as well as an avant-garde writer who may or may not be the author himself. The result is a loosely strung collection of hyperbolized, often surreal anecdotes. We discover that physicists, like poets, chase the unseen. Of course, they also chase skirts, promotions and prestige. In fact, in-fighting, petty jealousies and career-mongering obsess Ironburg's academic elite as much as their pursuit of an elusive atomic particle dubbed the Double-Few. Mr. Aksyonov's characterization of particular scientists is a bit slapdash. No one emerges very clearly as an individual; rather, they stand in for larger groups or cultural beliefs. For example, Veliky-Salazkin, Ironburg's aging patriarch, represents the passing generation of scientific supermen. Although he is held in awe by the younger technicians, much of the tension between the two generations is too subtle, too tied to inside humor to have much effect on a less than knowledgeable audience. Further complicating this situation is the uncertainty that comes from the author's use of several narrators in a constantly shifting time frame. Nonetheless, Ronald E. Peterson's translation has effectively caught the cynical edge of Mr. Aksyonov's satire. ''Our Golden Ironburg'' strives artfully to raise laughs from the potentially leaden subject of Soviet science.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Their parents might have guarded such a feeling as a shameful little secret, but this generation refuses to be quiet about it. The idea provides the nagging uneasiness beneath ''The Big Chill,'' the bedrock assumption of television's ''Thirtysomething,'' and the most astute feature of ''Big.'' In recent years, films from ''Star Wars'' to ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' have catered to this childish side of a huge potential audience. Both ''Ghostbusters'' films, with their slapstick waves of slime, first green and now pink, appeal to actual children and to their baby-boomer parents, who cling to the vestiges of the days when they howled at the Three Stooges on TV after school. In ''Ghostbusters II,'' even before a wily ghost sends Sigourney Weaver's baby racing into Manhattan traffic in his carriage, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson have left a children's birthday party in disgrace. The down-and-out ghostbusters had tried to entertain a roomful of kids who would much rather have seen cartoon superheroes.

The ghost of '' 'Our Crowd': The Great Jewish Families of New York'' hovers over Stephen Birmingham's latest novel - not a powerful ghost but an anemic creature quite incapable of breathing life into an improbable story whose banal prose and careless point of view are all the more perplexing because they come from a writer who has, at least in his nonfiction, demonstrated a certain narrative gift. Mr. Birmingham's heroine, Mimi Myerson, the innovative head of the Miray cosmetics empire, must save her company from the machinations of her mostly distasteful family - and from the clutches of her on-again, off-again lover, Michael Horowitz, a cocky real estate magnate with holdings in Atlantic City, as well as a turreted Palm Beach mansion clearly modeled on Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago. In between the elaborations of Mimi's business entanglements, there is romantic intrigue, greed, some humdrum (but mercifully quick) sex, a smattering of bisexuality and a touch of anti-Semitism. ''Shades of Fortune'' belongs to the genre of commercial fiction in which the opulence of contemporary New York society is evoked by the liberal dropping of luxurious brand names and the closest thing to a portentous image is the repeated mention of cockroaches penetrating the lavish apartments in a luxurious hotel.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

When the call came, Tristan was still unpacking the two duffel bags he had lugged home from New Haven. First year at Yale, so he had accumulated a lot.'' Thus begins the journalist, playwright and novelist Jose Yglesias' 11th book. And one could say that Mr. Yglesias has established a promising premise for his story: Grandpa, Juan (Pinpin) Granados, was the most famous Latin American writer of his generation and the cultural pride of Tampa's Hispanic section, Ybor City, which is replete with his Cuban-American relatives, both actual and self-anointed. Here, then, is the setting for comedy or tragedy, for a meditation on the hidden and obvious injuries of class - as well as the collision between a prim, cerebral Ivy Leaguer from New York and the earthy first- and second-generation members of his clan. But what ensues, as the young man tries to settle up the patriarch's estate, is oddly soft-pedaled. The characters seem no more than, well, characters, figures cast from a latter-day Damon Runyon mold. There is little in ''Tristan and the Hispanics'' to engage our sympathies, our anger or our sense of the absurd. The one character about whom we long to know more is the grandfather, who is revealed only through his computer files, which Tristan explores in an effort to get to know him. ''Tristan slowed down,'' reads Pinpin's account of a walk with his very young grandson, ''and said, 'Do you remember when we saw the white mouse?' and he looked up at me with shining eyes. It was a thrilling hurting blow. I was afraid for Tristan. That is how art begins. In remembering and wonder.'' That is how art begins.",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Poverman's fourth book of fiction is not a novel so much as a series of short stories that lurches around the narcissistic Jed Hartwick and his equally unlikable family and friends. The emotionally parasitic Jed and these other unsympathetic characters - manic-depressives, obsessive-compulsives and silent sociopaths - inflict physical and emotional pain on themselves and one another. They do this in pursuit of dubious motives and themes, which include the mutual resentments of fathers and sons, the idea of love as a prison and the family as torture, the romance of disorder and the belief in the purifying powers of self-destruction and pain. Tellingly, at some point all these characters bruise themselves or someone else. Not surprisingly, their emotions range from claustrophobia to panic to despair. And the nightmares that occur in a group with such obstinate pathologies are even worse. A facile chapter devoted to Jed's journey to India is implausible, absurdly out of step with the young Jed, who is mostly revealed in flashbacks to his glory days as a champion diver. The only remotely appealing character in ''My Father in Dreams'' is Jed's girlfriend, Grace, whose pregnancy inspires his self-examination. But eventually Grace ceases to engage our interest; if we like her and believe in her, how can we also accept her decision to ally herself with the infantile, shallow Jed?",1989-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Summer Crustaceans,"Better fishing conditions in summer make lobsters easier to trap, bringing prices down. Finding one-pounders at $4 each is common at many seaside areas in the Northeast. Lobsters in the 1 1/2- to 3-pound range fetch premium prices, around $6 a pound. Larger specimens sell for less, sometimes as little as $3.50 a pound. Large lobsters can be as succulent as small ones. Have a hammer on hand for cracking heavy claws. Be sure the lobster you buy is alive. Some people prefer female lobsters because of the coral, or roe, which can be eaten plain or used to enrich sauces. Female lobsters have a broader tail shell than males do. Although lobsters can be boiled or broiled, steaming is more convenient. Do not overcook. Bring a couple of inches of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the lobster, cover and calculate the cooking time. Before serving, slit the tail and crack the claws to allow excess fluid to drain out. Here is a guide for steaming lobsters: Weight of lobster Cooking time Number of servings 1-1 1/4 pounds 10 minutes 1/2 to 1 1 1/2-2 pounds 15-18 minutes 1 2 1/2-5 pounds 20-25 minutes 1-2 6-10 pounds 25-35 minutes 3-5",1989-07-29T05:00:00+0000

Three cases involve Ronald Saranow, the former hed of the I.R.S's criminal investigation division in Los Angeles: California Case I: Most attention has focused on Mr. Saranow and a legal battle between two big blue-jeans manufacturers, Jordache Enterprises and Guess Inc. According to testimony, the owners of Guess - the Marciano brothers - approached Mr. Saranow with information alleging tax and customs fraud by Jordache, their business partners and co-owners of Guess. Mr. Saranow pursued an aggresive two-year investigtion of Jordache without turning up any criminal violation. Testimony was given that the Marcianos repeatedly entertained Mr.Saranow and offered him a job with Guess. At issue is whether Mr.Saranow's relationship with the Marcianos should have disqualified him from any association with the Jordache case and whether he improperly used I.R.S. power on behalf of the Marciano family in its struggle for control of Guess. California Case II: Mr Saranow in 1986 tried to interfere with a Justice Department investigatin of a former I.R.S. employee whose lawyer was a friend of Mr. Saranow, according to testimony. Califronia Case III: Mr. Saranow is accused of setting up an unauthorized system by which clients of a lawyer friend could pay overdue taxes to the agency and be recorded as having paid on time. National Office Case: An assistant commissioner for criminal investigation in Washington was charged with routing many of his trips through Atlanta to visit a girlfriend, without fully reimbursing the agency for that travel. The panel found that agency officals had been reluctant to discipline the official. Central Region Case I: The agency's chief of investigations in its Central Region, based in Cleveland, was accused of taking an I.R.S. undercover boat for personal use in 1985. Central Region Case II: The same Cleveland investigator was also reported to have been stopped for speeding and driving while intoxicated when using an agency undercover car. The Duncan Case: I.R.S. attorneys are said to have told a former I.R.S. criminal investigator, William Duncan, who had complained about the slowness of a Justice Department narcotics case in Arkansas, not to give an opinion on the Justice Department's handling of the case and to ''deny the existence of information that had been reported to him concerning the alleged bribe of a high Government offical.''

The prepublication hoo-ha surrounding ''Fire & Fear'' - concerning the heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson's alleged pleasure in beating his sex partners, especially his former wife, the actress Robin Givens - focuses on but a throwaway passage in this otherwise insightful book about the brutishness of the modern professional boxing game and those who are drawn to it. The author, Jose Torres, was a world light-heavyweight champion, the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission and an early confidant of Mr. Tyson's. The story is ostensibly Mr. Tyson's, but in many ways it is that of Mr. Torres. There is little new information about the fighter's wretched childhood in a Brooklyn ghetto, his boxing education by the legendary trainer Cus D'Amato and subsequent fights in and out of the ring on his way to the top of the roughest hill in professional sports. Those looking for details about the fine art of boxing and about Mr. Tyson's sexual encounters will be disappointed. Both are mentioned, but only in relation to what Mr. Torres sees as the more important component of boxing, the psyche. Mr. Torres strips down the action of brawls in the ring, the bedroom and the promoters' offices to a series of one-on-one confrontations in which only the most adept with tongue, fists and guile prevail. Mr. Torres cites Mr. Tyson's meanest streaks as most necessary for a fighter. ''I used to make it my business to be a mean, ruthless bastard,'' the author quotes Mr. Tyson as saying. ''I knew I had to be mean because if I lose, I'm going to die, to starve to death.'' Seen in this context, even the seemingly most irrational acts of Mr. Tyson's recent years now appear quite a bit more understandable.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

Program forms, from situation comedies to action adventures, may remain the same, but content is always being adjusted to fit the changing times. As Nancy Reagan's glittering gowns gave way to Barbara Bush's sensible shoes, so ''Dynasty'' is about to be replaced by less upscale, possibly even gentler diversions. The shift in tone can surely be detected this fall in ABC's willingness to back a new series, ''Life Goes On,'' that has a retarded teen-ager role filled by a young man who was born with Down's syndrome. Why now? ABC insists it is only because this is a good family drama. Then, CBS has ''Peaceable Kingdom,'' starring Lindsay Wagner and set in a Los Angeles zoo. Environmental concerns and threats of species extinctions move to center stage on prime time. And at least one hourlong drama series, ''Wolf,'' also on CBS, will be offering the new kind of sensitive tough-guy hero who is evidently a role model of the 1990's.

Harry Middleton was an Army brat in his early teens when his father decided he needed ''a drastic change of scenery'' and sent him away to stay with his mother's people in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. Mr. Middleton, now a veteran nature writer and outdoor columnist for Southern Living magazine, found not only the wellsprings of his nature but his future profession during his short stay there with three contented, dignified old men, his grandfather and great-uncle and their friend, a World War I veteran. ''Only here in these mountains, here with these old men, amid the creek, the trout, the natural world, had I ever ceased to feel alone.'' The old men and the dog who expected and got his full participation in their lives and deaths were shortly gone, and so was their seductive life style - working their hardscrabble farm just enough to give themselves time for their real business, fishing and hunting the quarry they held in mystic reverence, reveling in the possibilities of wildness and the unity of all living things, spending cold fall nights on the roof wrapped in blankets to see the wild geese go south, reading and philosophizing. Though some of the stories are surely apocryphal, ''The Earth Is Enough'' is a satisfying memoir that overcomes an awkward start to build to real emotional impact. And Mr. Middleton's tone of wounded irony when speaking of his family is a striking counterpoint to his soaring lyricism in his descriptions of nature, ''a mystery, fascinating, soothing, damning, ruthless.''",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE ASSIGNMENT: Or, On the Observing of the Observer of the Observers, by Friedrich Durrenmatt. Translated by Joel Agee. (Vintage International, $7.95.) F., a woman film maker, is asked to look into the rape and murder of the wife of a psychiatrist, and she soon becomes the central character in a tapestry of intrigue, crime and terrorism. Last year our reviewer, Sven Birkerts, urged readers to bear with this brief, ambitious novel and its chapterlong sentences to appreciate it as ''a parable of hell for an age consumed by images.'' CHAPLIN: His Life and Art, by David Robinson. (McGraw-Hill, $14.95.) Charlie Chaplin, who revealed himself time and again through his movies, is revealed once more in this exhaustive biography, which reports on Chaplin the man and the artist, his Dickensian troubles and adventures, for nearly 800 pages. Writing in The Book Review in 1985, Garson Kanin said, ''In his painstaking and brilliantly researched book, with its immense wealth of names and dates and places and figures, Mr. Robinson has given us a valuable and important chronicle.'' CAT'S GRIN, by Francois Maspero. Translated by Nancy Amphoux. (New Amsterdam, $9.95.) A scrawny French teen-ager, nicknamed Cat, is caught up in the maelstrom of German occupation: his father dies in a concentration camp, his mother is broken, his brother joins the Resistance and through it all Cat survives. This novel, Herbert R. Lottman wrote here in 1986, ''brings us up close to the sights and sounds of occupied Paris. . . . We feel the weight of the German presence.'' CAPTAIN KIDD AND THE WAR AGAINST THE PIRATES, by Robert C. Ritchie. (Harvard University, Paper, $11.95; Cloth, $22.50.) By the late 17th century, piracy was falling out of favor as a way of settling differences, and Capt. William Kidd was unfortunate enough to be caught in the transition; he died in England at the end of a rope. In 1986 our reviewer, Jim Haskins, called Robert C. Ritchie's biographical study a ''fascinating story of political intrigue and complicated business-deal-making'' that makes the ''shadowy, myth-laden figure of Kidd a real and largely sympathetic character.'' TRUST ME ON THIS, by Donald E. Westlake. (Mysterious Press, $4.50.) A sane enough young reporter named Sara Joslyn finds herself employed by a sleazy, goofy Florida-based tabloid and before long is trying to succeed on the same lunatic terms as everybody else there. Molly Ivins, reviewing the novel here last year, called it ''delicious fun.'' ''In between stories about space battles, 100-year-old twins, dead country music stars and bizarre medical happenings,'' she said, ''Mr. Westlake has sandwiched a nice romance and a fairish murder mystery.'' THE SECRET WAR AGAINST HITLER, by William Casey. (Berkley Books, $4.50.) In World War II, long before he ran Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign or became a Director of Central Intelligence ensnarled in the Iran-contra affair, William Casey worked as a spymaster for the United States in England. ''Half history, half memoir, the book is a useful guide to O.S.S. operations run out of London,'' Robert Sherrod wrote here last year of Casey's account, which was not quite finished before his death in 1987. THE PHYSALIA INCIDENT, by Art Spikol. (Penguin, $3.95.) When a financier and expert snorkler dies off Bermuda, the sting of a Portuguese man-of-war is blamed, but the facts don't add up. The investigation by Alex Black, aided by his computer, is recounted in ''sharp, elegant writing,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year, calling this novel ''an auspicious debut.'' COMING OF AGE IN THE MILKY WAY, by Timothy Ferris. (Anchor/Doubleday, $10.95.) Ancient farmers were intimate with the night sky; it seemed close and knowable. ''Coming of Age in the Milky Way,'' Marcia Bartusiak wrote here last year, chronicles the ''awakening of the human species to the vastness of our cosmos. . . . It is an exhilarating, wide-ranging journey.'' THE ORIGIN OF THE BRUNISTS, by Robert Coover. (Norton, $10.95.) Robert Coover's reputation for invention, humor and intensity got its start with this, his first novel, the story of the founding of a crackpot religious sect. In 1966, Webster Schott, writing here, saw flaws but great promise: If Mr. Coover ''can somehow control his Hollywood giganticism and focus his vision of life, he may become heir to Dreiser or Lewis.'' THE FLIGHT OF THE IGUANA: A Sidelong View of Science and Nature, by David Quammen. (Anchor/Doubleday, $8.95). The nature essayist David Quammen has an eye for the exotic, from beaded lizards to black widow spiders. Harry Middleton wrote here last year that Mr. Quammen's is ''a prose loaded with ideas and emotion that is as thrilling and upsetting as a wild ride on a slightly unsettled roller coaster.'' THE FLIGHT OF PETER FROMM, by Martin Gardner. (Noonday Press/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) Better known as a lively science and math writer, Martin Gardner demonstrated an early flair for fiction with this 1973 novel about a hero who roams through Protestant doctrine. ''Can a novel whose action is essentially cerebral be exciting?'' Martin Levin asked here. ''Yes indeed - if the novelist is as engaged by the history of ideas as is Gardner.'' THE RAGE WITHIN: Anger in Modern Life, by Willard Gaylin. (Penguin, $7.95.) Is rage useful anymore? Or is it obsolete, an emotion left over from more primitive times? Willard Gaylin, a psychoanalyst and ethicist, offers an ''eloquent warning,'' Brett Harvey wrote here in 1985, against the anger that increasingly poisons everyday life.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

But somehow it doesn't seem as important as it used to be. That at least is the reaction of a listener who has recently spent glum hours listening to a new batch of recitals and happy hours listening to a batch of reissues (or, in some cases, newly published recordings by singers of the 78 and early LP era). Should one compare the two experiences? ''Why,'' asked Lawrence Tibbett once by way of expounding on the odiousness of comparison, ''must we baritones continually be compared with Battistini, Campanari, Maurel, Navarini?

This engaging novel, one of four by the Swedish writer Lennart Hagerfors, is an imaginative retelling of Henry Morton Stanley's famous 1871 expedition through what is now Tanzania to find the explorer David Livingstone. The book, as smoothly and literately translated by Anselm Hollo, is in some ways a sly refutation of Stanley's own self-serving account of these events (''How I Found Livingstone,'' published in 1872), as well as an implicit condemnation of the casual and brutish racism that characterized his entire era. Mr. Hagerfors's narrator is the unheroic John Shaw, a ne'er-do-well British sailor whose vulgarity suggests the truth behind the explorers' grand pretensions. Shaw is unhappy from the moment he joins the expedition, but as the party penetrates the interior he descends into a kind of Conradian madness. Haunted by obsessive images of the sea he has left behind, he hopes not to die until he can see ''the whales in Lake Tanganyika,'' a manifestly irrational ambition that serves to mirror and parody Stanley's monomaniacal designs. For Stanley, Livingstone is ''the light of Africa,'' yet when the great man is found he appears to Shaw - in a fine Darwinian reversal - as a chimpanzee-like creature who at one point is observed to be munching on his Bible. Lennart Hagerfors is delightfully adept at showing the many ironies of what used to be called the White Man's Burden; it never occurs to Stanley, caught in the heart of his own darkness, that the most intolerable burden of all may be the very presence in Africa of these self-important Europeans.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

Michel Khleifi, a writer and director born and raised in Nazareth and now living in Brussels, relies on a wandering, Eastern-style narrative to depict Palestinian traditions threatened by 20th-century inroads. The film is ''lyrical and extravagantly detailed when portraying the Palestinians. But because Mr. Khleifi turns simplistic and leaden whenever he points his camera at an Israeli . . . his often dazzling first feature is diminished by his insistently narrow vision.'' Still, this is ''a strong, rare example of Middle Eastern film making.'' (Caryn James) Mississippi Burning 1988. Orion Home Video. 2:07. $89.95. Laser disk (Image Entertainment), $49.95. Closed captioned. R. Taking the bare bones of the true story of three civil rights workers murdered near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, the screenwriter Chris Gerolmo and the director Alan Parker have come up with ''one of the toughest, straightest, most effective fiction films yet made about bigotry and racial violence.'' The principal characters are F.B.I. men investigating the victims' disappearance, played by Gene Hackman, in possibly the best role of his career, and Willem Dafoe. ''Some of the imagined twists and turns of the investigation go rather far off the track, but never for a minute does the film sacrifice the honesty of time, temper and place.'' (Vincent Canby) Tequila Sunrise 1988. Warner Home Video. 1:16. $89.95. LD, $24.98. CC. R. Robert Towne's second film as a writer-director ''has the fuzzy focus of someone who has stared too long at a light bulb.'' What starts as an entertaining romantic melodrama about a couple of high-school friends now on opposite sides of the Los Angeles law turns into an impenetrable mystery. ''The result is a long, teasing trailer for a film not yet made.'' Mel Gibson, as a former cocaine importer, and Kurt Russell, as a narcotics detective, make good company, and Michelle Pfeiffer provides a ''stunning presence'' between them. (Canby) Tidy Endings 1988. Prism Entertainment. 0:54. $79.95. Not rated. Harvey Fierstein, who wrote the Broadway play ''Safe Sex,'' from which this touching little drama derives, co-stars with Stockard Channing. Ms. Channing plays the former wife of a man who has just died of AIDS, Mr. Fierstein the homosexual lover for whom the man had left her. The bulk of the drama lies in an intelligent conversation between these diametrically opposite personalities, who dispute, explain and come to a teary and somewhat happy conclusion. ''This is a show of ideas and feelings, and the cameras always bear in mind the need to put a drama whose strength is in its words and sensibilities into a frame that does not upstage it.'' (Richard F. Shepherd) The Desperate Hours 1955. Paramount Home Video. 1:52. $14.95. CC. Not rated. The ''producer-director William Wyler has turned Joseph Hayes' [ novel ] into a crafty and crackling screen thriller,'' wrote a reviewer at the time of the film's release, ''in every respect save one. That is the matter of making the behavior of the characters believable.'' Humphrey Bogart, playing the strongest of three desperadoes who hold a family captive in a suburban home, conveys ''the menace and malevolence of the meanest kind of human beast at bay.'' Frederic March plays the father, allowed - incredibly - to leave, go to work and return.

us,Even Philistines Can Get It Right,"Two recent articles about the issues raised by the cancellation of the Robert Mapplethorpe photography exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington - Hilton Kramer's ''Is Art Above the Laws of Decency? (July 2) and Grace Glueck's ''Art on the Firing Line'' (July 9) - have prompted an unusually large number of letters from readers. Here is a sampling. To the Editor: The real issue is why did the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corcoran accept the show as art in the first place? The answer has to be that neither knew any better. Or that if they did, neither had the guts to apply intelligent criteria in the face of pressure to be trendy. And that is the kind of irresponsibility that will ultimately undermine public support for the arts - not the Corcoran's belated backdown. It's a cop-out to argue, as Grace Glueck does, that some works now regarded as great art were once viewed as outrageous.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

To the Editor: I was as chagrined and angered by Grace Glueck's article as I was moved and inspired by Mr. Kramer's. What I believe Ms. Glueck is missing is the undeniable connection between pornography and violence, a connection that has been verified by thousands of victims, police officers, perpetrators and mental health professionals. This is not an issue of censorship, or conservatives vs. liberals, of gay rights or museum integrity. This is an issue of civil rights, no different from a public display of work promoting anti-Semitism or racism. If we are to be a public that strives against the glorification of torture and degradation, then we must also be a public willing to say no to the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and those like him. The question that comes to mind is not why did the Corcoran cancel this show, or even why was the show scheduled in the first place, but why do artists like this gain prominence?",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Widening the Margin of Safety in Flying,"THE relatively high survival rate of passengers in the July 19 United Airlines crash in Sioux City, Iowa, has focused renewed attention on ways to make airplanes safer. In recent years the Federal Aviation Administration, under pressure from groups representing pilots, passengers, flight attendants and even the industry, has issued numerous rules and advisories intended to improve safety. Among the more sweeping is a requirement, now being phased in, that more than 150 parts be routinely replaced on aircraft more than 20 years old - at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars a plane. But many airlines face a shortage of mechanics at a time when more maintenance is required, and there is always the question of who should absorb the high costs involved in many of the changes. In other areas, some groups, including the F.A.A., have asked that on-board safety briefings be made more interesting and accurate to insure that passengers are learning the proper safety procedures. Here, compiled from discussions with government, passenger and industry groups, are other changes required, under discussion or suggested in an attempt to make flying safer.

us,NONFICTION,"THEY LOVE A MAN IN THE COUNTRY: Saints and Sinners in the South. By Billy Bowles and Remer Tyson. (Peachtree Publishers, $18.95.) This is a hardcore journalist's journalism, staples of the Southern political beat (best told with a couple of ink-stained fingers of bourbon) that never make it into the news. Billy Bowles and Remer Tyson, veterans of the turf who now work for the Detroit Free Press, traveled Dixie in the late 1970's interviewing the icons of a carefree time when politicians could be boys and not have to answer to a Congressional committee. ''They Love a Man in the Country'' is a collection of endearing yarns with no guiding principle beyond the injunction of the grandee of Southern journalism who tells the authors: ''love the rogues.'' Thus, they show equally cheerful forbearance toward Albert (Happy) Chandler, the Kentucky Governor turned baseball commissioner who endorsed Jackie Robinson's entry into the major leagues and yet never purged racial epithets from his own speech; Georgia's charmless race-baiting ex-Gov. Marvin Griffin; Herbert Douglas, the black bartender at a private club in Little Rock, Ark., who fobbed the bar tab of out-of-town reporters covering the 1957 school crisis off on the local segregationists; and Alabama's comitragic hulk of a Governor, James (Big Jim) Folsom, a victim of his own buffoonery as much as of his radical integrationist politics during his terms in the 1940's and 50's. Unlike their chapters on Orval Faubus and George Wallace, for example, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Tyson are able to contribute some new historical nuggets about Folsom as well as leave a poignant final impression of a man who, like several of the book's subjects, has since departed the Gothic world he helped make.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

The boy hopes to follow in his father's footsteps on the rodeo circuit, but Danny has other ideas. Instead he plans to show his son the traditional ways of his people, heading for the ancestral salmon fishing grounds of the Nez Perce along the Columbia River in eastern Oregon. But Danny Kachiah is a man with a troubled past, haunted by images of his dead wife, his alcoholic father and his great-grandfather, Left Hand, a heroic warrior under the great chief Joseph. When a meeting with a medicine woman is arranged, she instructs Danny on the ancient healing procedures that he must undertake before he can purge these ghosts. The process is begun, and Danny returns to the fishing village - only to discover that the nets have been cut and several buildings dynamited, presumably by sport fishermen who have been attempting to force the Indians from their sacred lands. In presenting the resolution of this crisis, ''River Song'' becomes not only a tale of reconciliation between father and son, and of a people with their heritage. It also emerges as a skillfully told story that illuminates the plight of American Indians as they battle to keep their way of life alive.",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

On July 12, 1986, Steven McDonald, a young New York City police officer, was gunned down in Central Park while questioning three youths about bicycle thefts. In this autobiography, written with his wife, Patti Ann, who was pregnant at the time of the shooting, and the journalist E. J. Kahn 3d, Officer McDonald, a devout Roman Catholic, recalls his last words as he blacked out were ''God, don't let me die.'' The youth who shot him is currently serving a 3- to 10-year prison sentence. Officer McDonald got what amounts to a life term. Paralyzed from the neck down when a bullet severed his spine, he has no feeling below his chin, cannot breathe for more than a few minutes without a respirator, can barely speak and needs constant medical attention. As he recounts at length in his book, the extent of his injuries made him a celebrity initially, though he did not feel in any way heroic and, at times, cursed his fate. What is most surprising, and honorable, is how Officer McDonald's struggle to cope, and the financial and emotional support his family received from fellow police officers, the news media, the Mayor's office, New York City businessmen, civic organizations and the Catholic diocese led him to a truly heroic understanding. ''The Steven McDonald Story'' combines inspirational messages, family history, police and medical lore, told alternately by Officer McDonald and his wife, with an introduction by John Cardinal O'Connor and a few first-person accounts from individuals such as Mayor Edward I. Koch, who, in a peculiar aside, pats himself on the back for his extemporaneous eulogies at police funerals. Throughout the book, Officer McDonald dwells on the positive aspects of New York City, insisting that ''there is more love in this city than there are street corners.''",1989-07-30T05:00:00+0000

It returned, as if by magic, as the same sleek, multi-tiered structure with what is called its ''Victorian jelly mold'' profile that has made the Palm House, a sanctuary for tropical plants, one of the most distinctive and repeated forms in modern architecture. Illuminated from within at night, and reflected in a pond the full length of its facade, the Palm House emerged as the fragile ''balloon of light'' described in a recent poem by the English poet Herbert Lomas.
