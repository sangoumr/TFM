Frank Bascombe, angst-ridden hero of Mr. Ford's 1986 novel, ""The Sportswriter,"" approaches middle age with an unmanageable son, an unrepentant ex-wife and a sense of the ""observance of human possibility,"" which doesn't, he fears, apply to him. THE LOVE LETTER, by Cathleen Schine. (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) Helen is 42, capable and loves Edith Wharton. Johnny is 20, acne-spotted and -- like, excellent! -- a big Tom Robbins fan. In this comic novel they fall in love. A MAN'S WORLD: How Real Is Male Privilege -- And How High Is Its Price? by Ellis Cose. (HarperCollins, $22.) A skilled analyst of gripes finds that most men (including so-called angry whites) are more confused than angry and more subdued than privileged; to his argument he brings persuasive numbers and moderate tones. THE NEXT AMERICAN NATION: The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution, by Michael Lind. (Free Press, $25.) An intelligent, industrious, not very cheerful look at possible futures. Balkanization through identity politics? Stratification, Brazilian style? THE PRICE OF A CHILD, by Lorene Cary. (Knopf, $23.) A sensual, funny first novel that transposes to pre-Civil War Philadelphia the theme of the author's 1991 memoir, ""Black Ice"": the duty of an escapee toward the oppressed she leaves behind.

The book, ""Rethinking America"" (Random House, $25) by Hedrick Smith, slips in at No. 10. It shares that spot with a classic in the celebrity book genre, ""Everyone's a Coach"" (Zondervan/HarperBusiness, $22), in which Don Shula, with the grammatical assistance of Ken Blanchard, reveals the secrets of his winning ways at the Miami Dolphins since he began coaching way back in the Kennedy Administration. Well, if we can watch ice hockey at the end of June -- and could you ask for a better example of what's wrong with America and capitalism than the owner of the New Jersey Devils? -- we can learn from the cheery Don Shula.",1995-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,DIARY,"DIPLOMACY Trade War, the Mini-Series Relax. You can have your Lexuses. The United States and Japan brought their tariff-rattling spat to a close last week with a predictably dramatic 11th-hour deal. But this mini-drama somehow left viewers unsatisfied: weak tea when strong coffee had been promised. With portentous huffing and puffing, the Administration had vowed, in Phil Gramm's words, ""a gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" -- nothing less than a historic cracking-open of Japan's notoriously sealed markets. But the agreement that emerged was deliberately ambiguous: no specific Japanese commitments on opening its markets, nothing enforceable. As one American trade expert put it, ""We talk loudly and carry a tiny stick."" LAWSUITS Now, Let Investors Beware The flood of legislation that's swamping this nation is clearly a mess, and many people, in response, indulge in an age-old reflex: blame the lawyers. That reflex is surely behind the drive to discourage shareholder lawsuits -- a battle that has inundated innocent civilians lately with a barrage of advertising. Brokers and accountants, emboldened by the Republicans strutting their stuff, have pushed for a law to limit lawsuits, saying many suits are frivolous. Consumer groups have countered with ads cautioning that small investors would be left with little recourse if they were duped. But anti-lawyer fever is clearly strong these Republican days, and last week the Senate approved the measure with a veto-proof 70-29 vote. INSIDER TRADING Too Tempting to Resist If the money's lying there, they will take it -- whether it's theirs or not. That seemed to be the lesson last week when a former Cravath, Swaine & Moore senior associate, and his brother, pleaded guilty to insider trading. There is a lot of money lying around these days -- in the form of advance information about the current flurry of mergers. And cases of insider trading are growing in tandem. Until now Cravath had prided itself on keeping its nose clean, but this lawyer passed on information that resulted in trading profits of nearly $1 million. Now you'd think that someone who'd reached such professional heights had it made (if by ""it"" you mean money), but the siren song was clearly too loud. MUNICIPAL FINANCE A County Circles Its Oranges A lot of people are against taxes, but Orange County voters surely take the prize. Last week they refused to approve a mere half-percent emergency sales tax increase, even though this defiant stand nudged them toward a rather messy abyss. The county's in bankruptcy, its debt is now in default, a state takeover looms, and it's far from clear how the trash will be collected and the students taught. Couldn't the county issue more bonds to make it all better? Right. A fellow here has a nice bridge to sell to those bond buyers. And perhaps worse, municipal bonds all over the place have gotten a black eye. HEALTH CARE The H.M.O. Giant Is Coming H.M.O.'s are coming. Yes, yes, they've been here for some time, but now they'll really be a force to reckon with. Last week United Healthcare, an H.M.O. giant based in Minnesota, agreed to buy Metrahealth, a more traditional insurer. Metrahealth, carved recently out of the Met Life and Travelers health businesses, has 10 million customers, including 1.5 million in the New York area. The merger with United Healthcare will create the nation's largest health-plan company. So if H.M.O.'s have always seemed a distant concept -- somewhere else, affecting someone else -- that is sure to change in a hurry. TOBACCO Keeping Minors From Smoking Let's see. Philip Morris wants to sell cigarettes -- that's its business. And most smokers start when they are teen-agers. Yet last week the company said it would go all out to keep minors from smoking. (Well, not exactly all out: the plan will cost $5 million; 1994 profits were $4.7 billion.) Highlights of the program are a national ad campaign, warnings that say ""Underage Sale Prohibited,"" and the end of promotional giveaways. What this means (choose one): a) Philip Morris, in a stunning about-face, actually wants fewer people to smoke, or b) ""They are scared,"" as an American Heart Association spokesman said, and want to undercut efforts to regulate tobacco as a drug and head off state efforts to clamp down on sales to minors. CORPORATE DIRECTORS Part Time. High Pay. Perks. Do directors earn their often-substantial pay? With corporate austerity all the rage, many shareholders (whose jobs, perhaps, were devoured by that omnivorous austerity) have been asking just that. So Graef Crystal, a pay guru who clearly relishes tackling such questions, took a look. In a report out last week, he found a huge range in 1994 board pay, from $3,600 at Berkshire Hathaway to $180,700 at Roadway Services -- or, as he put it more tersely, ""It's a mess."" He created a formula for defining how much is too much, and in what was surely a string of amazing coincidences, he found many companies at which both directors and chief executives -- who scratch each other's wallets -- were significantly overpaid. WORKPLACE The 24-Hour-a-Day Fast Track It's easy to fantasize about a $1 million-plus salary, the freedom from worry (No more credit-card interest!) the money would bestow. But such a salary could be a thief of freedom, too. If you worked, say, for Ronald Perelman, you might be on call morning and night, weekday and weekend. That was fine with Fred Tepperman -- until his wife got Alzheimer's. Then he needed more time at home, and soon lost his job as Mr. Perelman's chief financial officer. The company said he ""willfully failed to devote to his employer his entire time, energy and skill,"" while Mr. Tepperman insists it was no more than missing a few breakfast meetings to care for his wife. The courts will now decide who's right, for Mr. Tepperman has sued for more than $25 million in damages. TAKEOVERS How Does It Feel, Mr. Pickens? Takeover artists -- they're almost-mythic corporate rough riders, swooping in on pot-bellied managers, kicking them with their studded boots, and snarling, ""Get with it or get out!"" Such raiders, a breed apart, would surely never be on the receiving end of those kicks. Or would they? One fabled marauder of the wild 80's was one T. Boone Pickens -- the very name conjures images of a man who eats rusty nails with his steak. But sure enough, last week two big investors took aim at Mr. Pickens's natural gas company, Mesa, chanting the old raiders' chant: ""Enhance shareholder value."" And suddenly it was Mr. Pickens with his back to the saloon wall, for one of those investors is none other than Marvin Davis, the California billionaire.",1995-07-02T05:00:00+0000

His photographs are in the Social Realist tradition of Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. Many of his duotone images -- from a haunting study of baptisms in Coahoma County to a powerful vision of a worshiper at a church in Tutwiler -- bear witness to a joy and dignity undimmed by privation. His subjects observe the ceremonies of black life, sometimes in sadness, sometimes with a joyful noise you can almost hear. Mr. Light is never heavy-handed; there are no overwrought contrivances.

Since the designers are essentially predicting what they themselves will be doing, the colors they pick do indeed show up on all sorts of consumer products. Among the colors to expect in 1996 is Highway. As a designer puts it, ""This solid, stable gray stretches across the country from east to west."" The selection of which colors will saturate the marketplace is not supposed to be guesswork, but a result of study and discussion. One result of this study was the conclusion that ""the improving economy has sparked a rebirth in consumer optimism."" That, of course, is reflected in Red Haute. The group also noted ""a growing interest in all aspects of nature, the garden, vegetable colors and dyes, rocks and minerals, water and sky."" Thus, the prediction that a ""rich, complex mineral gray"" known as Wet Clay will be popular. And then there's the continuing trend toward ""multiculturalism and ethnic diversity"" seen in 'Round Midnight. This jazzy black is supposed to have a blue (did they mean ""blues""?) undertone. Lest anyone get too optimistic about the direction society is taking, one of the commercial colors forecast for 1997 (and not yet available to show here), is Alligator Alley, a blackish green that ""reflects the core of society as an urban combat color.""",1995-07-02T05:00:00+0000

Sir Laurence Olivier played the role so well in his 1948 film version that he became the only performer in Academy Award history so far to direct himself in an Oscar-winning performance. Actors in every generation have used the role of the melancholy, semisuicidal, possibly insane, possibly incestuous young Danish prince to establish their greatness or at least their credibility as serious actors.

Reading Between the Lines","""I think that the destructive element is too much neglected in art,"" the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) wrote in the last year of his life. As Carel Blotkamp notes in MONDRIAN: The Art of Destruction (Abrams, $49.50), the artist believed that ""the destruction of old forms was a condition for the creation of new, higher forms."" Mr. Blotkamp, who teaches modern art history at the Free University of Amsterdam, diligently traces Mondrian's growth from a traditional painter of landscapes to a significant innovator. Influenced by Cubism, Mondrian moved from his native Netherlands to Paris, where in 1917 he founded De Stijl, a group that advocated a future-oriented art Mondrian called Neo-Plasticism. Through a cogent explication of Mondrian's paintings and close readings of his dense and somewhat cryptic writings about art, Mr. Blotkamp shows how Mondrian continually refined his method, arriving at the colorful constructions of lines for which he is known today. Among the many pleasures of the book are its photographs of Mondrian's various studios (which look much like his paintings) and Mr. Blotkamp's commentary on them.

""Baseball"" and ""John Ford on his Deathbed"" -- in which Ford, surrounded by ghosts from his films, wears an admiral's bridge cap and brandishes a rosary -- are archetypally American. The assured style and all-too-certain troubles of old age are illustrated in ""Bad Back,"" ""Bad Eyes,"" ""Bad Thoughts"" and ""Bad Heart."" But Mr. Kitaj, a 62-year-old Ohio-born painter who has made his home in London since the late 1950's, is also a man of many words. And R. B. KITAJ (Rizzoli, $60) abounds in them. The pages of books, old and new, are elements in many of his early collages; the names of writers and philosophers show up in his titles; Mr. Kitaj's own fanciful tales and explanations of origins, references and meanings occupy full pages across vibrant reproductions of individual paintings. In an interview with Richard Morphet, the keeper of the modern collection at the Tate Gallery in London and the editor of the book, Mr. Kitaj comes across as articulate, funny, learned and humble.

Selected as one of the best books of 1994 by the editors of the Book Review, it features a narrator resembling Mr. Naipaul. Fiction is his means of exploration, much as the voyage was for the men of earlier centuries -- Columbus, Sir Walter Raleigh, Simon Bolivar and the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco Miranda -- who also appear as characters.

us,Oasis,"PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN WAYS OF USING CENTRAL PARK. SUMMERS it's for lovers, patzers, dreamers, cruisers, anglers, birders, foragers and practitioners of t'ai chi. Anything can happen. Here's proof: Once, playing with my friends near the 86th Street transverse, I looked up and saw a large brown handbag swinging from a tree. The reward was big enough for lunch at Schrafft's and a movie. In the monkey house at the old zoo, Caroline the gorilla spat at my grandmother and hit her in the face. (Caroline's cagemate was Jo Ann, the same name as my older sister.) The park is where, when my mother was 5, she buried Dickie, her pet canary, in a corn flakes box. Once, when there was a restaurant at Bethesda Fountain, I saw a man order an ""arty-choky."" He ate the whole thing, even the fur, with a knife and fork. Other, more amazing summer encounters: Egrets that look as if they're posing for Audubon, Madonna, Bill Clinton and almost every old boyfriend I ever had. Central Park is where you want to be in love, or feel more in love if you already are. It's where you must, must be kissed. For years growing up, I thought the bridle path was where you went to get married. Eau de coconut oil, dental floss bikinis, Bruce Davidson (who's been taking pictures in the park for four years), four kinds of music in Ivesian overlap on a Kelly green beach, the miracle when you're little of discovering mica in Manhattan schist and lying on your back in the sun in the exact same place you steered your sled that winter. It's democracy in action. There's no palm to grease for a honey hole at the Harlem Meer. Central Park is an oasis in a steel-and-granite Sahara, the center of the city that's the center of the universe. Once, when my son was sick, I opened his window and the sound of Simon and Garfunkel wafted in. Svengalisized, we got our bikes and went out into the night. The park was a party. Peter breathed cool air. By the time we got home, he was cured. Central Park is my gym, my Walden Pond, my $5 tennis club. Walking around the reservoir, I can't tell if what I'm hearing is a siren or a loon. We take from the park what we need. There's enough to go around -- 843 acres and it's all ours.",1995-07-16T05:00:00+0000

So what would New York Newsday journalists advise a young person about pursuing a newspaper career? ROBIN POGREBIN JIMMY BRESLIN, columnist: What are you going to do, go to banking? I would just go into the business. If you don't come out of rough times in this business, you don't belong. I came out of the toughest, and I can walk through fire. They better make sure they have their verbs in order before they start. If you've got sentences nobody can remember, then you better be allowed to kill yourself. SHERYL McCARTHY, columnist: I would not encourage a young person to go into journalism. It's not quite the same as becoming a minister, yet it is a kind of calling. You really have to be driven. If you want to have an interesting life, and if you want people to invite you into their homes and tell you their most intimate secrets - that's why you do it. PETE HAMILL, columnist: It depends on why you're going into it. If you're going into it in order to have a pension plan, don't do it. If you want to be famous, go and sell out your community and get a book deal or kill your wife or your husband. But, if somebody has that crazy, driven need to do it, you must do it. It was a lot more fun when the field was full of bohemian anarchists who stuck around for a while, threw a typewriter out the window and moved on. When I broke in, and there were seven functioning newspapers, so at least you could go down the block if some butcher on the copy desk destroyed your masterpiece that morning. But it's the most honorable work I can think of doing. Start in Pascaloosa, if you have to. KAREN ROTHMYER, assistant business editor: If you desperately want to be a newspaper person, do it. You'll be happy. It's a great life. If you're young, you can afford to be out in the middle of nowhere, writing three stories a day. AT 22, of course you should still do it. But if you're in your 30's and considering a career shift, I might say, maybe youshould think about it. If you've got a couple of kids and another 30 years of career ahead of you, I don't know.

us,DIARY,"STOCKS Sugar Blues for the Market Let's see. The stock market soars, led by technology stocks. Microsoft, the highest of tech, reports surprisingly strong earnings. So naturally the market nose-dives, led by technology stocks. At one point in Wednesday's free-fall, in fact, with the Dow down 130, Microsoft shares were $18 below where they'd been two days earlier. What happened? Perhaps it was that dreaded ""correction"" -- an odd term implying that the notoriously illogical market has some ""correct"" level from which foolish investors deviate. Or perhaps it was the Wall Street equivalent of gorging on sweets and then crashing after the sugar high. In any case, traders pulled out of it and the market held steady for the rest of the week. Bill Gates won't have to go to work at McDonald's. GREENSPAN WATCH Flirting With Clarity Alan Greenspan may have had something to do with that market bump, too. If he ever made himself totally clear, of course, the Dow would probably rise or fall 1,000 points in a day. There's no remote danger of him doing that, but last week he did skate perilously close to clarity, saying the economy ""may have passed the point of maximum risk."" In his usual hedging fashion, he added, ""We have certainly not yet reached the point"" where no risk remains. But the markets seemed to fix on his optimism, which might mean he has no plans for further interest-rate cuts. Or it might not. ELECTRONICS U.S. TV Maker? No Such Thing Considering that the average American lives and breathes by the almighty Tube, you'd think making TV sets would be the ideal home-town business. Far from it. Yes, many of the names sound all-American: G.E., RCA, Motorola, Zenith, Magnavox. But G.E. and RCA sets are sold by Thomson of France, Magnavox sets by the Dutch company Philips, and Motorola sets have been renamed Quasars by their Japanese manufacturer, Matsushita. Zenith held on alone -- until last week. A South Korean company called LG Electronics, which makes the Goldstar brand, bought control of Zenith. Now Americans can only sit and watch, at which they're proven experts. TRANSPORTATION Metro-North Strike: Never Mind For all the fuss, you'd think there had been a strike. Westchester and Connecticut commuters fretted or stayed home or plotted the least painful trek to the subway's far reaches. They watched and waited and talked, talked, talked -- the Strike That Wasn't provided endless conversational fodder. But then Metro-North pulled a trick out of its hat -- a Railway Labor Act cooling-off period -- and, Presto!, no strike threat for four months. Negotiators can get some sleep now, and commuters, after three days at the edge of their train seats, are left wondering whether the whole mess will be back in November. And why does no one mention, by the way, that Metro-North hasn't even raised New York fares for over five years? TOBACCO Is the Marlboro Man Happy? A survey out last week showed a sharp rise in teen-age smoking -- a big surprise, since that rate had held steady while adult smoking fell. But now, a tough question: Is this good news or bad for the tobacco industry? Last month Philip Morris announced a plan to cut smoking by minors, so presumably it would find this news disturbing. Yet rarely does anyone but a teen-ager start smoking, and if they don't start, there'll be no customers. But let's take Philip Morris at its word, making the next question this: How do you keep kids from starting? It's already illegal to sell minors cigarettes, of course, but that means little. Another survey shows that, nationwide, minors can buy cigarettes 75 percent of the places they try. THINGS MADE IN HEAVEN Scott, Meet Kimberly It almost sounded like a consumer-hip young couple finding joy in pooling unusual strengths: ""Scott is strong in bath tissue and towels; Kimberly is strong in facial tissue."" Scott ""has nothing in diapers and feminine pads"" but ""can open a lot of doors in Europe."" (As well he should!) But no, this was an analyst talking about Kimberly-Clark's planned purchase of Scott Paper last week, a $7 billion stock transaction the analyst called ""a very complementary deal."" And it's a deal that would create a powerful rival to the true giant of consumer products, Procter & Gamble. And why is Albert Dunlap smiling? Well, he's chairman of Scott Paper, and he could wind up with $100 million. Nothing to, uh, sneeze at. FRAUD Twice Bitten at Towers? Two years ago, the gloom was deep for creditors of Towers Financial. Towers descended into bankruptcy; its founder, Steven Hoffenberg, pleaded guilty to fraud, and creditors were out hundreds of millions in an unimaginably vast Ponzi scheme. Then came that fuzzy, golden moment when the pure of heart ride in and do their virtuous best to patch things up. A Los Angeles businessman named John Hall entered the scene, with the hope that he'd do all he could for creditors with Towers' tattered remains. But the fairy tale ends there. A lawsuit now contends that Mr. Hall, too, was merely intent on lining his own pockets -- that he siphoned millions from the patched-up venture by having it pay grossly inflated prices for worthless assets. REGULATION Safety Rules: Hard to Kill Business is dying to get rid of a lot of environmental, health and safety regulations, and it seemed the reigning Republicans would oblige them. Regulation-slaying legislation, way up there on Congress's checklist, was moving along nicely. But last week, outnumbered Democrats managed to kill it, borrowing the tactic that had sunk Henry Foster's chance to be Surgeon General: talk it to death. And as with Dr. Foster, backers of the bill couldn't quite come up with the votes to cut off debate. ""I regret that we have failed the American people again,"" said Bob Dole, who would have loved to add the bill to his resume as he applies for that job up Pennsylvania Avenue. But environmentalists surely saw no failure. PUBLISHING Let 'em Read Balance Sheets ""I like our core businesses,"" said Mark Willes. Well, if you say so. It was a bit hard to tell last week. Mr. Willes, after all, is the new head of Times Mirror, whose ""core business"" is newspapers, and he had just closed New York Newsday, cutting 750 jobs. Just days later, as part of a broad sweep of the broom, he said he would cut 1,000 more newspaper jobs, including 700 at The Los Angeles Times. Yes, costs must be cut, shareholders must be kept cozy and warm, and Mr. Willes, once a General Mills financial executive, is certainly trying to do that.

us,Unnatural Light,"Artistic success and a lasting reputation depend on talent, timing, a healthy dose of self-promotion and an extensive network of collaborators. By the time he started making photographic portraits in 1854, Felix Tournachon, known as Nadar, had already established a name as a writer and a caricaturist. He seemed to know everyone in Parisian intellectual and artistic circles; he later claimed to have 5,000 friends. Many of them sat for him, and Nadar's images of French writers and artists are considered among the best photographic portraits ever made. NADAR (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $65) includes some of the photographer's work from his most creative years. As restless as he was enterprising, Nadar (1820-1910) used electric light to photograph Paris's catacombs and sewers, but most of his artistic passion was spent on portraiture. Thanks to technological advances, sitters no longer needed to be clamped rigidly into place. This freedom, along with his use of light, large prints and simple compositions, allowed Nadar to achieve his characteristic vitality. Most of his subjects -- including Daumier, Bernhardt and Delacroix -- are fully engaged with the photographer and, by extension, with the viewer. Commercial success nudged Nadar into producing more conventional images typical of the Second Empire, but his restless spirit soon found a new fad -- ballooning; in 1858 Nadar produced the world's first aerial photographs. Maria Morris Hambourg, a curator of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, provides a lively examination of Nadar's early years; essays by Francoise Heilbrun, a curator of photographs at the Musee d'Orsay, and Philippe Neagu, another curator there who died in 1994, illuminate French culture, intellectual life and photography in the 19th century.

Dr. Steve Grove, Military Academy Historian at West Point, says that when he speaks to tour groups, questions about the colonists' naming of Constitution Island invariably come up. He says that the colonists would have been familiar with the British constitution and wanted to show that they were adherents to its concepts. The British constitution is a collection of documents and unwritten conventions, including the Magna Carta, legal decisons and acts of Parliament.

Art Attack","The fake fur flies in CONFESSIONS OF THE GUERRILLA GIRLS (Harper Perennial, paper, $18), a compilation of acidly witty agitprop posters by the self-styled ""conscience of the art world."" Formed in 1985 in response to a perceived backlash against female and minority artists during the art boom of the Reagan 80's, the Guerrilla Girls are a New York-based collective of female artists and art-world professionals whose identities are concealed by snarling gorilla masks (they maintain that this ""mask-ulinity"" emphasizes issues over personality and foils blacklisters). They have mounted a late-night terror-art campaign against museums, galleries and critics they contend are guilty of sexism and racism, papering Manhattan with posters whose punchy graphics and deadeye accuracy have earned them the envy of advertisers and the enmity of the art-istocracy. Fifty of their greatest hits are here, among them ""Do Women Have to Be Naked to Get Into the Met Museum?,"" which depicts Ingres's ""Odalisque"" sporting a gorilla head, with the words ""Less than 5 percent of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85 percent of the nudes are female."" Their hands-down winner, by popular acclaim, is ""The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist,"" whose mockingly Pollyanna-ish list of fringe benefits includes ""Working without the pressure of success,"" ""Knowing your career might pick up after you're 80"" and ""Not having to choke on those big cigars or paint in Italian suits."" A leveling indictment of bigotry in the art world, the work of the Guerrilla Girls elevates cage-bar rattling to a fine art.MARK DERY",1995-07-30T05:00:00+0000
