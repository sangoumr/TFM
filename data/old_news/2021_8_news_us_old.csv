When they opened Le Crocodile, the French brasserie on the hotels ground floor, the partners, Jon Neidich and the chefs Aidan ONeal and Jake Leiber, had their eye on a sixth-floor space for a wine bar. So in May 2019, they opened it as Lemons, with a breezy Coastal Italian approach. It was meant to be temporary, a pop-up, Mr. Neidich said. It did not have a full kitchen, and we planned to renovate it. Closing for Covid gave the partners more than a year to install the kitchen and redo the space, which offered views of the Empire State Building. The partners were inspired by Parisian neo-bistros and wine bars. Their quality is at a high level, but theyre more informal than restaurants, Mr. Neidich said. The menu features small plates, many of them with seafood like lobster salad, oysters and salmon rillettes. A few more substantial items include halibut and chips, and paella rice with duck and snails. Among the desserts is chocolate babka with salted caramel ice cream. The wine list, assembled by the beverage director Rafa Garca Febles, is global and lengthy, with many choices by the glass and several nonalcoholic drinks, for which Mr. Neidich said he sees increasing demand.

You could practically reach into your pocket and pay cash for an apartment up here, recalls Rawlins, who at the time was a few years out of graduate school and working at Alexander Gorlin Architects while also taking on the occasional teaching gig or independent commission. Today, hes known for immortalizing the work of the 20th-century architect Horace Gifford with his 2013 book, Fire Island Modernist, and for his own reimaginings of midcentury styles and spaces  he recently completed a restoration of a late 60s Harry Bates-designed home in Fire Island Pines. Moving uptown, says Rawlins, would allow him to reconceptualize his life. I realized I didnt have to be a cool kid in the Village and that, if I worked out of my home, I could call the shots professionally, he says. And so he and his then-partner, the artist Tad Mike, purchased two units in the same 1935 cream brick co-op  a 700-square-foot one-bedroom to live in, and a 1,050-square-foot two-bedroom two floors below to use for their studios  and Rawlins launched his own practice.",2021-08-05T19:21:40+0000

Lately, he has found them lacking their customary verve and intensity, a shortcoming he attributes to global warming. But not those made in 2020. He raves about the vintage. Though his company imports 22 different oils, some are worth knowing, like leccino oils by Pruneti, a classic; and Sgona, more forceful, $59.99 for both. A new oil for his company is the herbaceous Fonte di Foiano 1979 from the Bolgheri region, sold as part of a set of six from areas in and around Chianti for $157.50. Also in that set is the Volpaia from the Classico district, a blend of several olives thats deep green, minty and viscous with bracing bitterness.

Now his sons, Paul, Erick and Irving Noriega, and another partner, Chris Lin, are cultivating the crop organically, dehydrating and pulverizing it to make a salty powder they call Green Salt. Its salty enough to use in place of table salt, though its substantially lower in sodium. It adds a nice touch of vegetal flavor when dusted atop a deviled egg, baked potato or sauted fish.

I, too, turn to coffee on long stretches of boring road, but for me, one addition is essential: vanilla soft serve, for a concoction I like to call an affogato Americano. Go to any fast-food restaurant that serves ice cream and coffee (most do), order both and mix. Eat this in a parked car before the ice cream melts and the coffee cools, as I did recently on Interstate 81 heading south.

The book explains high-end cocktail bars in Japan and more informal izakayas; his bar blends both. Many of the books recipes, with long drinks and Japanese riffs on classics, are demanding; some simpler examples are the Japanese highball using frozen whiskey; the Far East Side with sake, tequila and shiso leaves; and Friday in the Park combining pear cider and vermouth (though he recommends making your own vermouth).

The spaces were used in the past by A.I.G. executives for board meetings, private dining and contract-signing ceremonies. They have been converted into this restaurant featuring experiential tasting menus ($245 per person, including tax and a welcome beverage); an elegant, oval cocktail bar called Overstory; and, at the very top, a private dining room. There are a total of 12 terraces with breathtaking views in every direction. Diners will get to see every inch of Saga, including the kitchen, as they are guided from room to room for each course of the executive chef James Kents meal. Menus are conversations, said Jeff Katz, the general manager and co-owner. Were trying to eliminate the standard come-into-the-restaurant, sit-at-the-table and start-the-meal-in-20-minutes format. Customers need not dine at Saga to belly up to the brass-and-marble bar at the 24-seat Overstory, which is reached by a dramatic flight of stairs.

In 2016, a big yellow cat crashed a game between the Cardinals and the Angels. There was the infamous Attack of the Killer Kitten in 1984, in which a gate-crashing cat bit the finger of the Seattle Kingdome groundskeeper who caught it, and, before that, the legendary Cubs-Mets Black Cat Incident of 1969, in which a black cat paced in front of the Cubs dugout, leading (according to some) to the Cubs continuing their losing streak.",2021-08-18T09:00:07+0000

us,A Futuristic Chair From the 50s,"The modern architect Gio Ponti created many of his iconic furniture pieces between the wars, but those from the 1950s are among his most sensuously radical. Embracing the revolution in industrial manufacturing and new materials in Europe, he conceived of the Round D.154.5 chair in 1954. With its contoured, soap bar-shaped back and seat, connected by two arcs of molded plywood, it was covered in two-tone Vipla, an Italian marine vinyl. Ponti referred to it informally as otto pezzi, or eight pieces, for the number of components used in the deceptively simple design, and featured the hyperfuturistic chair at Alitalias Manhattan offices, which opened in 1958. Now, in collaboration with the Ponti archives, the Italian furniture brand Molteni & C has reimagined the work in ash wood and covered in a variety of textiles and leathers, including this terra-cotta-colored linen. Wearing its covert innovations lightly, and still fashioned from a mere otto pezzi, the chair remains as rigorously insurgent as it is supremely comfortable.

By the 1920s, the maison was experimenting with exotic Art Deco creations and, in the early 30s, it pioneered a groundbreaking new technique called the Mystery Set, by which gemstones could be arranged in a mosaiclike pattern without any visible supports. Its sautoirs, minaudires and brooches quickly became favorites among royals and Hollywood stars including Marlene Dietrich, for whom Van Cleef created one of its most iconic designs, the Jarretire bracelet, in 1937. The story goes that Dietrich gave a handful of her gemstone-studded pieces to Louis Arpels, the brother of Estelle and one of the companys founders, and asked him to create something special. And so the Jarretire was born: The modernist platinum cuff featured an exaggerated, asymmetrical loop covered in cushion-cut rubies set atop twin bucklelike bands of baguette-and-pav-set white diamonds. (The pieces name translates to garter, and indeed the design resembles the band worn around the top of a womans stocking.) Dietrich famously wore it in Alfred Hitchcocks 1950 noir thriller, Stage Fright (she also insisted on head-to-toe Dior for the role), and to the Academy Awards a year later.",2021-08-20T13:00:07+0000

He began by selling hard-boiled detective yarns to the pulpy magazine Black Mask, then later sold his first novel, The Big Sleep, to Alfred A. Knopf. In 1943, Chandlers third novel, The High Window, was read by the Paramount director Billy Wilder. He liked the way Chandler wrote dialogue, and offered him a contract of $750 a week for 10 weeks to work with him on a screenplay for Double Indemnity, James M. Cains novel.

In the space that was Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, theyve pivoted from Italian to French, with the bar, tables and an open kitchen dedicated to bistro fare, and changed the name to Bar Benno. The elegant flagship Benno, which has three stars from The New York Times, in the back of the space will not change, except to feature more seafood when its ready for diners in a month or so. But now, fitted with a huge back bar and a U-shaped counter with seating, the new spot, called Bar Benno, will feature a cold seafood selection, and hors doeuvres like escargots, egg in a potato crust, pt de campagne, and Basque-style tripe on its classic menu. Main courses include rotisserie chicken, steak au poivre and bourride, a rich Provenal seafood stew rarely seen on New York menus. Fries will come alongside steamed mussels, a French dip sandwich and steak tartare. From 5 to 7 p.m., with aperitifs and cocktails, there will be savories like deviled eggs with caviar, salmon rillettes, white anchovies with bread and butter, and fried pigs trotter with sauce gribiche. I didnt feel it was enough just to reopen as we were before, Mr. Benno said. Ive been cooking French most of my whole career, so Im very comfortable with this. Fortunately, we did not have to do a big renovation. Mr. Benno also said that it was difficult for Leonelli Restaurant and Bar, an Italian taverna, to establish its own personality. But, he said, offering bistro fare in a space thats something of a prelude to the Benno dining room and that leans toward France made more sense. A taste of Italy with flatbread pizzas, breads and pastries remains available in Leonelli Bakery in the front of the building. (Opens Friday)",2021-08-24T16:51:47+0000

(The hotel is part of a chain with a strong presence in Central America and Mexico.) The chef, Byron Peafiel, a native of Ecuador, takes some liberties with tradition: His small plates include pupusas with curtido (a kind of cabbage slaw), charred octopus with jalapeo hummus, and grilled broccolini in a mole sauce. Large dishes are guava-glazed roasted chicken, aged churrasco (rib-eye for two) with chimichurri, and chaulafan (Ecuadorean fried rice) chicharrone using black rice, seafood, pork rinds and salsa verde. Deep-fried plantains (patacones) are served for the table, complimentary. Gilded Groups beverage director, Daniel Bedoya, who was raised in Ecuador, has devised an array of cocktails. These are served in the airy ground-floor restaurant with yellow accents that has outdoor terrace seating on two levels, and also at the 10th-floor Rooftop at Selina Chelsea with expansive views and a plunge pool.
