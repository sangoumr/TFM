The New York City Medical Examiner concluded that violent shaking had caused the brain damage. While on the ventilator, her heart stopped last month. Lois Scoon, a lawyer, and her husband, Malcolm, an anesthesiologist, denied abusing the baby. When Mariah was first hospitalized, the issue was the ambiguity of state laws requiring hospitals to accommodate relatives who objected to taking a brain-dead patient off life support.

us,Baseball Books in Brief;Game Faces,"George Brace is the type of photographer and baseball fan who concerns himself less with capturing frantic moments on the diamond than with collecting and sorting vast stores of arcane data and images. In THE GAME THAT WAS: The George Brace Baseball Photo Collection (Contemporary, $35), Richard Cahan and Mark Jacob, two editors at The Chicago Sun-Times, have taken photos from Mr. Brace's collection of hundreds of thousands of negatives (most of them made by Mr. Brace himself) and organized them into the kind of offbeat categories -- sluggers, players wearing glasses, players with funny names -- that card collectors love. The authors chose only black-and-white images taken from 1929 through 1960, and they provide ample baseball lore in their captions. Mr. Brace, who was born in 1913, documented many aspects of baseball, but his portraits and his grand views of the Chicago baseball parks, where he was based, hold the most interest. His best portraits are distinguished by the openness and humor of the players' faces; his images are suggestive of rural America of years past. In his close-ups, the visors of the head-hugging baseball caps serve to frame the faces, drawing the viewer into the animated exchange between photographer and subject. Yogi Berra becomes all grins and ears, Carl Hubbell's intense stare is riveting, and the young Ted Williams radiates self-assurance. When Mr. Brace turned his viewfinder toward Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park, the ball fields were rendered as vast, almost sacred places. Altogether, the book has the feel of a family album -- an intimate and glowing view of a comforting past. Rosemary Ranck",1996-04-07T05:00:00+0000

I would shortly develop pneumonia, then blood clots. I was hospitalized four times over five months. But by the end of that year, I thought differently. My health rebounded, almost certainly because of AZT. I was doing so well; I really might beat it. Now, it is clear I will not. You can beat the statistics only so long.

The treatments simply are not there. They are not even in the pipeline. A miracle is possible, of course. And for a long time, I thought one would happen.

In DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI (Abrams, $29.95), Russell Ash, the author of numerous books on art, including volumes on Edward Burne-Jones and Toulouse-Lautrec, portrays Rossetti as an undisciplined youth whose florid personal style eventually took him to the center of the Victorian artistic world. Along with his fellow painters William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and others, Rossetti founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a movement Mr. Ash characterizes as having an ""idealized and escapist view of an imaginary 'golden age' rooted in the medieval world, with its traditions of courtly love and chivalric duty."" Others in Rossetti's circle included the art critic John Ruskin, Burne-Jones, William Morris and the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and George Meredith. Rossetti, who was also a poet, married his model Elizabeth Siddal in 1855; in 1862 she died from an overdose of laudanum. Racked with guilt that he had ignored her for his work, Rossetti buried the only complete set of his poems with her, and then ordererd her body exhumed seven years later so that the poems could be retrieved and published. Because of frequent bitter criticism of his work, the artist rarely exhibited publicly, and his final years were marked by insomnia, drug abuse and doomed love affairs, including one with another of his models, William Morris's wife, Jane. While Mr. Ash's account of Rossetti's colorful life is cursory, his commentary on each of the 40 full-color plates reproduced offers valuable insight and information.

Countless women and men experienced those years as crucial -- feminism gave them an inner clarity that continues to sustain -- but for most people the task of life is overwhelming, and without the compelling factor of daily activism, hard truths become blurred, difficult to hold onto. People fall back on the familiar, on that which gives ready comfort. As feminism appears to lose ground, quietude and inertia fill the vacuum. Quiet brings on anxiety, and anxiety makes anyone lose his or her nerve. On the right, the loss of nerve is greeted with relief; on the left, it's an occasion for panic. Orwellian phrases develop quickly to assure an end to the radical impulse: post-feminism, second stage, a different voice. The words indicate progress but the meaning is regression.

It was at ease with its assumptions for 14 years: after that, two dreadful wars, huge serial changes, technological revolution, the disappearance of British power, the rise of the welfare state, a decade or two of ""peace"" in the world abroad, dramatic upheaval once more. Now that I am 80, I see I have been shaken up like dice in a box, if not as painfully as people born 10 years earlier than myself. Many are still alive and in voice. I am abashed by my survival, rather than proud of it; there is no merit in it. The credit goes to those secretive gamblers we call the genes. I come of long-lived forebears among whom there were few defaulters on the Yorkshire side. Also, because of the great advances of medical science and hygiene, the average expectation of life in Great Britain has enormously increased in the last 50 years or more.

I would have to relive that night when another eye looked back at me through the peephole in the opposite cell, an eye I never saw again but have carried with me as an integral part of my body, of my very nature, so that something of the owner of that eye will continue to live, the prisoner who was surely murdered and thrown into a mass grave.

Since his survival strategy involves feigning mental illness, Fabian must undergo a unique therapy at the not-too-gentle hands of Dr. Gonalves, a combination shaman and psychiatrist who practices in the requisitioned office of a ""disappeared"" dentist. Sitting in the dental chair, surrounded by drills and other implements of the trade, the patient spins out tales that are part memory and part contrivance, all designed to maintain his status as ""a psychotic with severe and intractable disabilities."" It is not easy work, for the doctor demands quality stories: ""These standard hallucinations! Vibrating canoes, anacondas! Old hat! Rivers fermenting beneath their cargo of leaves. . . . Always the same junk! Sexual symbolism for half-wits!"" Obediently, Fabian digs deeper, inventing and reinventing himself, winding his way through love affairs, shootouts and voyages of exploration and discovery until finally, traveling upriver toward the source of his imaginings, he appears to invent Dr. Gonalves himself. In Linda Coverdale's spirited translation, ""Naming the Jungle"" (which is the first of Mr. Volodine's books to be published in English) emphasizes the uncertainties of the characters and their jumbled lives by placing them in an especially well-defined world. The therapy Fabian goes through to maintain his supposed craziness involves establishing an Indian identity by naming the plants and creatures of the jungle. Only the people remain hard to pin down. But that uncertainty, that refusal to locate themselves, Mr. Volodine suggests, is precisely what makes them worth caring about. James Polk",1996-04-14T05:00:00+0000

Several of the hostages remember being told not to worry, that it was merely a sit-in; others recall the students excitedly making calls from the embassy and recounting their adventures to their friends.

The reversal is significant to Tesoro and the two other producers -- KCS Energy Inc., based in Edison, N.J., and the Coastal Corporation, based in Houston -- because it means that Tennessee Gas, a unit of Tenneco Inc., must buy gas from the three companies under terms of the 1979 contract, which sets prices much higher than current ones. Tesoro's stock jumped $1.125, to $10.75; KCS was up $4.25, to $21.875, and Coastal was up 12.5 cents, to $39. Tenneco said it would ask the court to rehear the case.",1996-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Notes From Underground,"What was it like to be an insider in Andy Warhol's Factory? You'll get only a vague idea from Mary Woronov in SWIMMING UNDERGROUND: My Years in the Warhol Factory (Journey Editions, $19.95), her account of the years she spent as a dancer with the Exploding Plastic Inevitable and an actress in movies like ""The Chelsea Girls."" This is no how-it-was memoir seen from sober, reflective middle age. Ms. Woronov writes as if she had been in a perpetual amphetamine haze, too high to notice much of what was going on besides drugs. In her Factory, there was no music, except for a mention that the Velvet Underground's Lou Reed ""had two iron mistresses, music and heroin,"" and no art but for the night Warhol was seen sketching noses. There was a lot of crawling on bathroom floors and hanging out with drag queens at Max's Kansas City. Ms. Woronov recalls filming ""The Chelsea Girls,"" and possibly another movie, but she wasn't sure if the camera was on. This Factory alumna offers few insights into the famous-for-being-famous people around her. THE VELVET YEARS: Warhol's Factory 1965-67 (Thunder's Mouth/Publishers Group West, $24.95) brings the Factory into focus, and not just because the book consists principally of photographs. Stephen Shore, who had the run of the loft, took enigmatic, posed but casual portraits of the Factory's denizens: Edie Sedgwick, Lou Reed, International Velvet, Ondine, Ingrid Superstar, Billy Name, Ultra Violet, Mary Woronov. In accompanying interviews by the novelist Lynne Tillman, we hear about Warhol's dedication to his work, and about the critical reaction. Paul Morrissey describes the artist as dependent on others to do things for him, and claims there were no wild parties, while Jonas Mekas remembers great parties with guests like Montgomery Clift and Tennessee Williams. And Billy Name recalls the day Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas and nearly died. Andy Warhol remains elusive, but it's clear his acolytes loved him -- even though they agree he wasn't much of a talker and was cheap. Carol Peace Robins",1996-04-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Another Country,"Cross Channel By Julian Barnes. 211 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $21. WE live, Julian Barnes suggests in an earlier book, in ""a pragmatic and knowing century""; we are also, he says in another, ""modern and ignorant."" Can we really be all these things? Of course. Knowingness is not knowledge, and pragmatism and modernity are two of our favorite boasts about ourselves. But who is making this diagnosis? In the first case it is Geoffrey Braithwaite, the grieving, widowed doctor and ardent Flaubert fan who tells the story of ""Flaubert's Parrot""; in the second, it is the deviser of the brilliant exploration of Gricault's ""Raft of the Medusa"" in ""A History of the World in 10 Chapters."" These characters are not exempt from the condition they describe, they are symptoms of it: wry, witty, belated, supposedly practical, often helpless. Behind them hovers the shadowy figure of Julian Barnes himself, who is just as wry, witty and belated, maybe as practical, and presumably quite a bit less helpless. I'm not so sure, though. Style and intelligence, which Mr. Barnes has in abundance, can focus helplessness and allow us to think about something else, but they can scarcely make it go away. Would we want it to go away, in all cases? ""How do we seize the past? How do we seize the foreign past? We read, we learn, we ask, we remember, we are humble; and then a casual detail shifts everything."" This is Braithwaite, and ""the foreign past,"" for him, as for Barnes and for us, is delicately weighted with a double meaning: the past of a foreign scene or a foreign writer, and the past of our own life or marriage or love, which, as L. P. Hartley famously said, is a foreign country. Braithwaite's answer is more than modest, but his initial metaphor is surely too greedy, full of the promise of failure. We don't seize the past. At best we get a picture of it, and a couple of chances to revise the picture. And the past, in Mr. Barnes's fiction, becomes a figure for a whole series of separations and gaps, places where the mind or the memory can't quite reach the other side, as if the ferry were becalmed, or the tunnel not complete: between then and now, of course, but also between there and here, between them and us, between her and him, between any event and the chance of our understanding it.",1996-04-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Furtive Glances,"Mori Ogai's novel THE WILD GOOSE (Center for Japanese Studies, University of Michigan, cloth, $28.95; paper, $14.95) is a small book that gives immense pleasure. Eloquently understated, it provides a lyrical account of the thwarted romance between a Tokyo medical student and a young woman who is the mistress of a dull middle-aged moneylender. Written early in this century and translated here with an insightful introduction by Burton Watson, the narrative illuminates the rigid social order of Japan in the 1880's, an era when that country's rapid Westernization was just beginning. Okada, the story's protagonist, is noted for his good looks and virtue. Yet despite his heroic nature, he can't rescue Otama from her fate. The relationship of Okada and Otama consists of furtive glances, a smile, the tip of a hat -- and Okada's rescue of a pet bird from a snake. The novel's disarming power grows from its minimal plot, its muted descriptions of the two main characters and its narrative viewpoint (the action is seen in flashback through the eyes of one of Okada's schoolmates, a technique that provides esthetic distance). Spare, symbolic imagery reinforces our understanding of all the characters, particularly the women, whose only available responses to disappointment are silent suffering and dissembling. Mr. Watson's introduction outlines the autobiographical elements in the story, and a careful reader may discern Ogai's intimations that he is writing a new kind of fiction. Certainly he was influenced by his substantial reading of European writers, and he ranks as one of the key innovators of modern Japanese literature -- but the success of ""The Wild Goose"" rests on its timeless portrayal of the clash between social caste and romantic love.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;She Must Be Crazy,"At a cliffside restaurant in a swanky Caribbean resort, wealthy vacationers pause between spoonfuls of passion-fruit sorbet to monitor the progress of a lone swimmer as she sidestrokes out to sea, faithfully escorted by her three Irish setters. Is she crazy? the diners ask one another with a mix of fascination and horror. Doesn't she know about sharks? The swimmer's name is Adele, and by some standards she must be crazy: not so long ago, she turned her back on a pampered, privileged life in the Connecticut countryside to fly off to India and worship at the feet of a tyrannical guru. Narrated in part by one of Adele's acquaintances, THE WOMAN WHO WALKED ON WATER (Riverhead, $21) unfolds in brief, elegantly written chapters, keeping its distance as it traces this restless, enigmatic woman's attempts to lose herself in something greater. Seen from the narrator's detached perspective, Adele's headlong pursuit of enlightenment proceeds inexorably, like a 10-car pileup viewed in slow motion far in the distance. As she steadily recedes from her earthly existence, Adele sacrifices not only her autonomy and her material possessions but also a chorus of bewildered family and friends. She loses weight, her hair becomes streaked with gray, she suffers from mysterious illnesses. But could she be exchanging these mundane measures of health for a deeper spiritual well-being? Is Adele's flight from her former life transcendent or tragic? As it explores these questions, Lily Tuck's second novel emerges as a haunting, strangely perplexing meditation on the quest for higher meaning -- and the steep price that seekers (not to mention those around them) must pay.

The artworks in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: Drawings & Observations (University Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive/Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $24.95) prove her point, demonstrating the possibilities of drawing today, after its ""death"" as a mandatory artistic skill. In contrast to Ms. Bourgeois's elegant, highly finished sculptures, her drawings are impromptu records of raw feeling registered in symbolic form. The artist's absorbing commentary (recorded during interviews with Lawrence Rinder, curator for 20th-century art at the University Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, who also contributes an excellent introduction) reveals the emotional and philosophical roots of her imagery. With an acute sensitivity to materials and form, she fuses elusive iconography with subtly inviting colors and textures.

It's frankly startling, then, to imagine that this elegantly demure apartment, belonging to the head of a prominent French fashion company, was once a 50's period piece with wall-to-wall shag rugs. As far as Hampton was concerned, eyes closed against the memory, ""it was a totally blank page."" And so he stripped it back to its Georgian Revival bones, adding enough molding and paneling to make a bolder stage set for the owner's eclectic antiques. From Louis XIV purebreds to Chinese lacquer, the furniture was collected over many years, each piece the object of a long-term, if serial, infatuation. ""They don't buy furniture,"" Hampton says of his clients. ""They fall in love with it.""
