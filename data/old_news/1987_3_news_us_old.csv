Three influential experts, possibly wounded that their advice was not heeded by President Reagan in early 1983, are terrified by the possibility of abandoning ballistic missiles! The Reykjavik meeting revealed that this potentially dramatic first step toward dismantling the world's nuclear arsenal was, in fact, attainable. The authors are preoccupied with posing enemies (e.g. ''the expansionist totalitarian states'' and the nuclear-freeze movement) and have lost sight of the fact that we are all inhabitants of one world, that we possess the weapons to destroy our planet many times over and that we must work cooperatively with the Russians to find new solutions to our predicament.

It is the hemline that sails saucily shorter, or the one that drops delicately downward. It is the shoulder that is squared, or the one that is bared. It is the waistline that is pronouncedly centered, or the one that is markedly raised. It is the silhouette that reveals the body, whether through carefully curved seams or soft folds that insinuate and cling. Nostalgia and avant-gardism abound, and both have validity. Deliciously decorative touches are employed with abandon, but there are also luxurious clothes lacking in overly rich details. For some women, just one wacky, witty accessory will be enough; others will immerse themselves in the new. And, as always, there will be those who will stick to the classics.

Conventional New York literature can frustrate a West Sider, whose neighborhood often gets brushed off in a few paragraphs about Lincoln Center, the Ansonia and the American Museum of Natural History. An entire book on the subject should be as welcome as it is overdue. And James Trager, who lives on the West Side and whose books include ''The Foodbook'' and ''Letters From Sachiko: A Japanese Woman's View of Life in the Land of the Economic Miracle,'' is an enthusiastic chronicler. He is witty enough to describe the archetypal West Sider as ''an overaged hippie in running shoes, topped by a muskrat coat, Vearing too much makeup, with the ashes of her cigarette falling on her sleeve as she waited in line at the health food store.'' He is thorough enough to compile a detailed appendix of more than 400 West Side apartment houses. He is knowledgeable enough to enliven what had seemed to be the nondescript past of Columbus Avenue with stories of prizefighters sparring at Sharkey's athletic club, as recorded in the paintings of George Bellows; as well as those of America's first indoor ice-skating rink; a shopkeeper named Richard Hellman who kept a jar of his wife's blue-ribbon mayonnaise on the counter and gave America one of its most enduring brands; Lauren Bacall growing up to the roaring punctuation of the Ninth Avenue el; a company called Horton's, whose ice cream was served on ocean liners and at inaugural balls. Unfortunately, Mr. Trager's enthusiasm also hurts the book. He has so many facts and anecdotes to share that he crams them into a text that forms an interesting scrapbook but is not cohesive enough or well enough written to make anyone but an avid West Sider care.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"HARD TIMES COTTON MILL GIRLS. Personal Histories of Womanhood and Poverty in the South. By Victoria Byerly. (ILR Press, Cloth, $26; Paper, $9.95.) ''Hard Times Cotton Mill Girls'' provides just enough background about Southern cotton mills to place these stories of women who work in them in context. Some readers may be annoyed by the author's summary approach to such issues as the political and economic forces that led to the growth of the ''cotton mill village'' at the end of the Civil War and the racism and sexism that created the multitiered economy of mill communities (mill work was a step toward emancipation for white women, many of whom employed black women as domestics). But the book's value and beauty reside in the personal stories of North Carolina mill workers - from that of Crystal Lee Sutton, whose life was the basis for the film ''Norma Rae,'' to that of Annie Adams, who struggled to move from cleaning mill floors to inspecting cloth (typically, a white woman's job). Out of these women's lost dreams, small triumphs and perseverence, the author has pieced together a mosaic of American labor history that is moving as well as exasperating. The child of three generations of Southern cotton mill workers, Ms. Byerly narrowly escaped a life in the mills, thanks to a college scholarship. And it was her exposure to Northern textile workers (she now teaches adult literacy in Boston) that inspired her to gather data on their Southern counterparts and seek out the personal testimony of women still at work in the mills. These oral histories of 20 white and black women are the powerful result of that inspiration.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"EDDIE BLACK. By Walter F. Shapiro. (Arbor House, $15.95.) Walter F. Shapiro's first novel is a thriller of high order: fast, literate and plausible, with more psychological insight than gunplay. Eddie Black, an unemployed New York actor driving a meat truck, kills his boss when, in a violent argument over their pay, the hot-tempered butcher goes after Eddie's friend Vincent with a carving knife. Vincent, who has a criminal record and is terrified of returning to jail, convinces Eddie to leave the body, take his salary and let the police think it was a robbery. ''Ten minutes later I, Eddie Black, day laborer, sometime actor, and killer, was on the Lexington Avenue Local with my money in my pocket. Another working stiff going home for the weekend. Except I didn't feel like a stiff. I wasn't even tired anymore.'' As in nearly all exceptional crime novels, the moral implications of the act - not to mention its practical complications - expand like ripples in a pond, disturbing every aspect of the killer's life. Worst of all, things start going right for Eddie. That evening he falls for the beautiful Charlotte, and in the following week he lands a part in a soap opera. Even while lying to the police, Eddie keenly senses this perversion of justice, and his search for a means to confess leads him deeper into trouble. In language that is gritty and spare the author creates several colorful characters, among them the crooked detective investigating the case and Eddie's mobster uncle, Willie. ''Eddie Black'' satisfies the demands of its genre, but never loses sight of its underlying theme - one man's perilous journey toward redemption.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"VERSION AND DIVERSION. By Judith Terry. (Morrow, $17.95.) Jane Austen's modest description of her writing as a ''little bit (two inches wide) of Ivory on which I work with so fine a Brush,'' suggests an imagination that knows its limits and prudently dwells within them. In this neo-Regency novel modeled on ''Mansfield Park,'' the British writer Judith Terry shows clearly that she is a fan of Austen's imagination but not of her restraint. She has shoved off some of Austen's characters from their pristine bit of ivory into a sooty underworld populated by revolutionaries and roues. The result is an odd yet amusing compound of Austen, Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Sade. Austen, invoking her favorite word for the ridiculous, would have called it a ''quiz.'' The adventures of Jane Hartwell, the heroine of ''Version and Diversion,'' begin when she secures a post as lady's maid to Julia Bertram, the youngest daughter of Mansfield. Austen focused on the ritualized flirtations of the drawing room, averting her gaze from the teeming life ''below stairs.'' One now understands why. Within a few short chapters, Jane has been assaulted by Julia's brother Tom, cavorted in the boathouse with Henry Crawford, an object of Julia's affections, and - most remarkably - been radicalized by the working-class politics of the servants' quarters. (''I am not a stick of wood to be used or not used by anyone,'' she tells Tom Bertram in a fit of egalitarian pique.) When even this enlarged Mansfield manor can no longer contain Jane, she runs off to London where she falls into the groping hands of a murderer and his bisexual mistress; from thereon all polite connections with Austen's world view are severed. ''Version and Diversion'' will irritate devout Janeites, entertain other readers with its command of Regency slang and manners, and persuade everyone of Austen's wisdom in knowing that less is more.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Within the past year or two, some of the world's most imaginative directors have heeded Mr. Brustein's advice.

In ''Bobby Kennedy,'' a husband and wife team has written a straightforward if adulatory biography that traces their hero's political development from an acolyte of Senator Joseph McCarthy to the liberals' heir apparent. ''This century has not seen a more remarkable reversal made by a public figure,'' the Davids write. How explain the change? His ''exposure to the real world'' of racial injustice, beginning with the 1960 Presidential primaries. Notwithstanding their hero worship, the authors, both journalists, acknowledge that Kennedy was ''ruthless.'' His feud with Lyndon Johnson is correctly described as ''one of the most bitter in recent political history.'' On the other hand, this flesh-and-blood portrait captures the zest and zaniness of Kennedy's family life, and shows him at his best - with children and the poor. His relationship with Marilyn Monroe is explored, but the authors conclude that the facts about it ''will probably never be known.'' Although they cover familiar material, the Davids have done original research (including interviews), and they provide fresh insights. They dispute the popular belief that Kennedy decided to run for President only after Senator Eugene McCarthy's strong performance against President Johnson in the 1968 New Hampshire primary. Three days earlier, they report, Kennedy had made a commitment to run but was not then ready to declare his candidacy. Had he done so, the authors conclude, McCarthy supporters could not have likened him to ''a jackal coming to feast on the carcass after someone else had made the kill.'' Moments before his assassination, after learning he had won the 1968 California primary, he told a friend, ''I feel now for the first time that I've shaken off the shadow of my brother. I feel I made it on my own.''",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Learning what was and suspecting what might have been are at the heart of Robert Sobel's intriguing history of the RCA Corporation, its founder, David Sarnoff (who was 80 years old when he died in 1971), and the parade of executives that followed him. Mr. Sobel, the author of ''IBM'' and ''ITT,'' digs carefully into the history of RCA and Sarnoff's incredible career. The result is a fascinating study of an innovative thinker who foresaw the impact of radio in 1916 and of television in 1924, but who, the author writes, eventually ''led RCA into unchartered territories, which resulted in a string of missteps, errors in judgment, and outright blunders.'' Mr. Sobel's account begins with the evolution of early wireless technology and concludes with the sale of RCA to General Electric in 1985 for more than $6 billion. ''RCA'' has the stuff of a smash television mini-series: intrigue between Wall Street and Washington, corporate raids, market wars and hardball corporate power plays. Sprinkled throughout are some historical corrections, including a reconsideration of the contributions of the Russian-born Vladimir Zworykin to the invention of television. Though ''RCA'' is a catalogue of amazing stories, it is especially a tale of missed opportunities and flawed judgment. An example was RCA's indifference to the threat of Japanese competition in the early 1960's, when it unwittingly handed over state-of-the-art technology licenses to Japanese manufacturers.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 A Nancy Reagan-Donald Regan clash on the telephone about 10 days ago sealed Mr. Regan's fate, White House officials say, adding that Mrs. Reagan got him dismissed from his post as chief of staff. 1 A changing 1988 Presidential race now that both Howard H. Baker and Mario Cuomo are out of the running is expected to lead to intense competition for the newly uncommitted and to a clarification of the Republican field. 1 A picture of Lieut. Col. Oliver North in the Tower Commission report shows that his tireless advocacy, tenacity and occasionally deceit allowed him to run some of the Administration's riskiest foreign policies. 14 A U.S. delegation was unprepared for its secret mission to Teheran last year and trusted the promises of a middleman who lied, the Tower Commission report says. 14 Western Europe sees Mr. Reagan as having been crippled by the Tower Commission report, commentators and politicians indicate. But they are divided about whether he can recover his authority as the leader. 15 INTERNATIONAL 3-9, 18-22 Moscow offered an arms agreement that would eliminate Soviet and American medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe within five years. Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was willing to sign such a pact ''without delay.'' 1 Moscow's offer was welcomed by the Reagan Administration, which expressed hope that the two sides could move quickly to conclude an arms accord. The basic elements of such an accord are already worked out. 1 In Paris, a terrorist was sentenced to life imprisonment, the harshest sentence allowed under French law. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was found guilty of complicity in the 1982 murders of an American and an Israeli diplomat. 1 Corazon C. Aquino offered amnesty to Philippine rebels who surrender within the next six months. In a brief address, she said she wanted to ''heal the wounds of our nation.'' 5 Press restrictions in South Africa, which have steadily tightened over the last 16 months, have proved effective at limiting reports of apartheid-related violence and at shaping international news coverage. 20 Israel hopes more Jews will emigrate from the Soviet Union and has been asking Washington to help insure that the emigres will settle in Israel rather than in the United States. 3 NATIONAL 23-33, 46-52 New long-term-care insurance plans designed to keep people out of nursing homes are beginning to be offered by some of the country's largest insurance companies. The policies provide services in the home. 1 Preserving Gullah, a blend of English and West African languages, is the aim of a project to translate the Bible into the language, which is spoken by 250,000 people along the Georgia, Carolina and Florida coasts. 24 A conference on negritude, the concept that Africans and those of African descent scattered in the Americas share a heritage greater than their color, was sponsored by Florida International University. 28 An exploding star's behavior is baffling scientists.

When a down-at-the-heels historian named Martin Radford agrees to untangle a historical riddle for a wealthy patron his luck finally seems to be turning. Radford's pursuit of the riddle - which involves the inexplicable ruin of an Edwardian politician, Edwin Strafford - soon draws him into an intricate tale of murder and multiple betrayal. Betrayal is at the heart of ''Past Caring,'' and in this first novel the English writer Robert Goddard has done an expert job of piling one betrayal on top of another. The book is a good read, but also more ambitious than that. It tries to connect the betrayals to a broader view of history: ''After the Enlightenment,'' says one character, ''one day, they'll call this the Disillusionment.''",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Does the tenant have the right of first refusal at the price offered to the other party? Is the sponsor obliged to notify the tenant in advance of the sale? . . . S. F., Manhattan Answer: The answers to both questions is no. The regulations regarding co-op and condominium conversions, promulgated by the State Attorney General Office, give tenants a 90-day period during which they have the exclusive right to purchase their apartments at insider prices and terms. Once the exclusive purchasing period has ended the tenants then have first refusal rights to buy the apartment for the same price and under the same terms offered to outside buyers.

us,PHOTOJOURNALISM'S COLORFUL ERA,"PHOTOJOURNALISM IS ALIVE AND WELL, despite television. There may even be more news photographers at work now than in the 1940's, the heyday of the big American picture magazine. Today's work is mostly in color and is marketed worldwide to hundreds of publications. The best of it gives news events the permanence and haunting quality of art. The pictures here are by photographers represented by Contact Press Images and are part of an exhibition opening March 6 at the Midtown Gallery of the International Center of Photography in Manhattan. PHOTOJOURNALISTS WERE SLOW TO ADAPT TO the technical advances of photography. For a long time, 35-millimeter black-and-white pictures by Henri Cartier-Bresson, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Capa and David Seymour were revered as the ideal. Color was considered frivolous, the tool of advertising. All that changed rapidly in the last decade as color film became ''faster,'' that is, able to record events quickly without special lighting or long exposure. New lenses could capture good color, even at low levels of light, and handier, more sophisticated cameras brought the photographer in close. Advances in reproduction and printing made it possible for weekly newsmagazines (and now daily papers) to use color on tight deadlines. Today, pictures can be rendered into a digital code and sent by satellite to markets anywhere. Fast color is the name of the game. THE TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE NOT changed the goals of serious photojournalism, which remain those of the ''golden age'' of the 40's and early 50's: to offer visual information that legitimizes, confirms and reinforces what is written, and to capture the beauty, the tragedy and the universality of the human experience. ''People say we're inundated with pictures of blood and gore, images of the unpleasant side of life,'' says Robert Pledge, president of Contact, an agency made up of seven regular photographers and six others who are contributors. ''It just isn't so. Most of the pictures we see every day are pure entertainment - Princess Di, Dolly Parton and so on. The fact is that many of the images of violence and suffering are so powerful that people rarely forget them.'' The photographers still complain that editors use the wrong pictures. But despite their concern, the evidence of pictures like these leaves no doubt that their art remains vibrant.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,THE INSTANT SEASONED TRAVELER,"Following is a primer, offering suggestions to help the traveler smooth the way and get better value on a trip abroad. AIR TRAVEL is much more expensive in Europe than in the United States and on the Atlantic routes. European airlines belong to an organization that structures fares to what the expense-account traffic will bear. If you're not in a hurry, travel by rail. BREAKFASTS in hotels are often a treat in such countries as Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Israel and may tide you over for a good part of the day. Many of the better hotels in Austria, Switzerland and West Germany, and some in France, include buffet-type breakfasts in their rates. In Italy breakfasts are usually skimpy if included, and expensive if not. CABS are more expensive in many European cities than in New York, mainly because gasoline costs more throughout the Continent. Fleets of radio-dispatched taxis operate in most places, but they often have a hefty charge on the meter when they pick you up. Cab rides from the airport to your hotel may cost $40 and more in Paris and Rome. Take the airport bus or the train wherever possible, as in Zurich, where the train from Kloten International Airport to the railroad terminal is $2.60. DEALS. The relative dearth of American tourists in Europe has prompted several regions, cities, hotel owners' associations and travel industry groups to offer special deals. These include package arrangements for accommodations and meals for periods of from three days to three weeks, and vacation booklets with cost-reducing coupons. EATING SPOTS. Meals in Europe's best restaurants start at around $50 a person and may go far beyond $100, especially with a good wine. Lunch may cost a little less than dinner, but not everywhere. Don't just follow the guidebooks; seek out local advice as well. At Citta' di Castello, a walled town in Umbria, I recently accosted a portly gentleman in the main piazza and asked him where I could get a decent lunch. ''There are two smart places nearby,'' he said, ''but their food is just so-so, and they are expensive. Go to Didon's, out on the highway to Perugia one kilometer from here, and you'll be grateful to me.'' I did and I was. FAST FOOD. You presumably aren't visiting Europe to eat cheeseburgers and milkshakes, but once in a while you might yearn for fast food, not to mention the chance to save money. The international chains have outlets in many European cities, and they feature such regional dishes as North Sea fish fillets and apple strudel. GUIDED TOURS are scorned by sophisticates, but permit a useful preliminary survey of a city or region. Fees for bus tours are usually reasonable, but keep in mind that many tour guides will steer their clients to restaurants, snack bars and souvenir shops and receive a fee in return. That fee will almost certainly be reflected in the price you pay for any merchandise. HOTELS. Even if you can afford $400 a night for a double room in a five-star hotel, you will probably be better off in a good medium-priced, medium-sized hotel. Switzerland publishes a brochure recommending one-star hotels, many of them family-operated, at around $32 a person a night for a room with a shower or bath, less for a room with only hot and cold water. INFORMATION. Collect all the details you need before starting your trip. National tourist offices in major United States cities can help with material on transportation, hotels, sightseeing and special events. JEANS are the unisex travel attire throughout Europe; in Eastern Europe people will even offer to buy the ones you are wearing. But be sure to pack something a little more formal than jeans, too. KIDS are being charged half rate or even less by many hotels in Europe now; ask about special rates when you book. Save money and nervous energy by sparing your children culinary adventures; they'll feel much more at home in fast food outlets and pizzerias. LUGGAGE. Experienced travelers know that less is best. Porters are no longer available at many airports and railroad stations and lower-priced hotels have dispensed with bellmen. MONEY. Change your dollars or traveler's checks at a bank; it will almost always be more expensive at hotels, travel bureaus and stores. Outside banking hours and on weekends official rates will be paid at currency-exchange booths at airports and railroad terminals. With the dollar fluctuating in value it may be risky to use credit cards. NIGHTCLUBS, limousines, gambling casinos, and gondola rides in Venice should all be avoided if you're on a tight budget. The same goes for black-market currency deals in Eastern Europe, where you may get stuck with bogus money or be courting legal trouble. Don't carry your wallet in your back pocket. Don't buy icons from touts in Moscow or Leningrad. Don't travel without a ticket on rapid-transit services in European cities: If you get caught, it won't help to claim you don't know the rules, and you'll have to pay a fine on the spot of at least 10 times the fare. OVERTIPPING should be avoided. In most European countries a 10 to 15 percent tip is already included in restaurant bills, and an additional 5 percent is usual for very good service. If your cab doesn't carry a notice that the tip is included, give 10 to 15 percent. PHONES. If you want to call home, do it from the local post office or telecommunications center. Most if not all European countries have authorized hotels to put a sizable surcharge on long-distance or local calls. It may even be cheaper to call collect. To be connected to an A.T.&T. operator in the United States, dial 080-089-0011 in Britain, 19 00 11 in France, and 06-022-9111 in the Netherlands. In other countries, dial the local operator for collect or credit-card calls. QUEASY feelings are something to be avoided on vacation, so play safe when it comes to exotic foods or bizarre beverages. Pack your favorite remedy for settling an upset stomach, or experiment with the local product. RENT-A-CAR. The international car rental companies operate fleets and offices in almost all European countries, but in many places local companies undercut their rates. Most of the local companies do not ask for a deposit if you produce a major credit card and an American driver's license (an international license, obtainable through the American Automobile Association, is even better). SHOPPING. Unless you get better advice from knowledgeable local people, downtown department stores are good places for exploring before turning to specialty shops. Duty-free shops at airports are not always cheaper than downtown stores. TRAINS in Europe range from the splendid French T.G.V. to crowded crawlers in the Balkans that can be recommended to no one but the hardiest traveler. In Western and Central Europe train travel is generally much cheaper than flying. Important centers are linked by intercity day trains; many long-distance night trains have sleepers as well as special coaches with four or six bunks to each compartment, available at a small surcharge. UNEXPECTED expenses invariably crop up, so keep some cash aside for possible emergencies. V.A.T. stands for value-added tax, which in most European countries is added to bills for all goods and services, including hotel rooms and meals. It can go up to 30 percent and even more for such luxuries as jewelry. Make sure the price you are quoted includes all taxes. Some countries refund taxes to tourists who take purchases out of the country; practices vary, some paperwork may be involved, and you may not be able to pack your purchases in checked baggage. WALKING is a great money saver. Many European cities spread out around a historic core holding castles, churches, palaces and other monuments that can be best visited on foot. It helps if you are staying close to the center. Many international hotels are based on the outskirts of cities because real estate is cheaper there and expense-account travelers don't mind taking taxis to business conferences. X FOR EXTRAS. It is almost always cheaper to buy what you want and take it to your room yourself than to call room service. As hotel restaurants often can charge more because they are so handy, you may want to go to a nearby cafe for coffee. Many deluxe restaurants in Europe have an annoying habit of serving hors d'oeuvres, sherbets or pastry that you haven't ordered, telling you they are offered by the chef. They are then put on your bill. YOUTH is well served in many European countries. If you're under 26, for instance, a Eurailpass good for a month will cost you $310; for two months it's $400. But you must travel second class and pay a surcharge for express trains. Youth hostels are widely available, with prices ranging from $8 to $10 a night. In France a special Youth Card offering discounts on air and rail transportation, as well as admission to sporting and cultural events, is available to people 25 years old and under. Restaurant privileges include year-round access to university dining rooms (where a meal costs about $2.50) and discounts at fast-food chains. Cards, valid from June 1 to May 31, are available at Youth Information Services located in town halls, tourist offices and Credit Mutuel banks. ZERO EXPENSE. Not all the best things in life are free, but some still are. There is no extra charge for the view of the Alps from your train window. And once you are there it costs nothing to gaze on the beauty of St. Peter's in Rome, the Acropolis in Athens, the waterfronts of Nordic cities or the dramatic west coast of Ireland.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

He arrived there in 1929, just at the end of that magic decade, and began writing articles on bohemian life for the European edition of The Chicago Tribune. His column, much of which is reproduced in ''On the Left Bank 1929-1933,'' was an irreverent who's who of the avant-garde. It poked fun at all who haunted the Latin Quarter or who took themselves too seriously. He described Ford Maddox Ford as a ''huge, bland bulk'' whose jaw ''woggled'' when he danced, and wrote that Aldous Huxley, then 38, looked ''like a person who had been concentrating for 75 years.'' Much of Mr. Bald's commentary was tongue in cheek; he was a master of the one-liner and the telling anecdote. His columns consisted of reconstructed conversations, barroom banter and gossip, amid his reports on gallery openings, dance performances and parties. Most wicked were his comments on visits with artists and writers. He reported that Gertrude Stein told him that all of literature would come down to ''the big four'': Poe, Whitman, James and herself. ''The Blood of a Poet,'' a new film by Jean Cocteau, was, Mr. Bald wrote, ''as false as a gold tooth and just as obvious.'' Occasionally he was sentimental, especially toward the end of his stint in Paris. By 1933, as more and more of the old guard left for America, he lamented that ''nothing will remain but a legend and half a dozen crowded saloons.'' And, it could be added, this stylish commentary by a witty raconteur.",1987-03-01T05:00:00+0000

''It was still too much of an emotional issue for her,'' Mr. Wolper recalled recently. But in 1986, he said, five years after her treatment, the former First Lady relented because ''it would help other people.'' The result is to be aired tomorrow on ABC. Mr. Wolper said Mrs. Ford initially objected to some strong scenes depicting a family confrontation over her alcoholism and some arguments with her husband.

Monsieur Pamplemousse eats and drinks again in this diverting novel, the third in a series of mystery-farces featuring the French detective turned gastronome. The mystery begins with the disappearance of ''Souffle Surprise'' from the menu of a three-star establishment in the French Alps. To restore the missing dessert Pamplemousse must track down a kidnapped pastry chef; his search leads him into danger - at an exclusive girls' school with a suspicious record of skiing accidents - and deeply into farce, during an amorous encounter with Fraulein Brunnhilde, the school's mountain-size gym teacher. Michael Bond is well known as the writer of the Paddington Bear stories, as well as other books for children. In his first series aimed at adults, he has created a comic idea of a French detective -Pamplemousse philanders, knows wine labels like his ABC's and treats his canine sidekick, Pommes Frites, like a human being. No matter. Serious insight, except in matters of food and wine, is not the point here; nor is the mystery, which is easier to solve than the crossword puzzles Pamplemousse does to improve his English.

This fine production, featuring members of the New York City Ballet under Merrill Brockway's direction, makes artful use of closeups to emphasize both the intricacy and the dramatic power of the choreography.

Sundstrom scored his 20th goal of the season 17 minutes 59 seconds into the second period and Pederson followed with his 20th at 18:11. The Canucks won despite being outshot by Buffalo, 37-19. Play in the defensive zone was a determining factor in the game, with Vancouver playing solidly in front of Frank Caprice and the Sabres playing loosely in front of Tom Barrasso.(AP) North Stars 5, Flyers 4: In Bloomington, Minn., Brian Lawton and Dino Ciccarelli scored the tying and go-ahead goals 3:31 apart in the second period. Kari Takko had 40 saves for Minnesota.(AP) Blues 5, Penguins 5: Greg Paslawski scored with 1:57 left in the third period to give St. Louis the tie in Pittsburgh. Paslawski fired a shot over Gilles Meloche's glove from the left face-off circle for his 20th goal of the season.(AP) Track Boileau Takes Marathon: Art Boileau of Canada led most of the way and won the second Los Angeles Marathon, which drew a field of almost 15,000.

Shola, a senior at Hunter College High School in Manhattan, set a New York State public high schools record with her time, which also is the fastest in the country this season. Nnenna, a sophomore at Hunter, had a personal-best time. Two other New York State records were set. Notre Dame of Staten Island ran 9:15.80 in winning the two-mile relay and Tilden of Brooklyn was first in the mile relay in 3:52.40. Notre Dame's time was 1 second off the national record, while Tilden's clocking was the best in the country this season.

us,Question Box,"QUESTION: Suppose Don Mattingly has hit safely in 30 straight games, then goes 0 for 3 before his last turn at bat in the ninth inning of a game the Yankees are losing badly. On the first pitch to him in the ninth, he hits a catchable foul pop off third base that the third baseman drops for an error. If Mattingly lines the next pitch for a single, does he extend his hitting streak or is it over because of the error? Without the error that extended Mattingly's turn at bat, there could be no hit to extend his streak. But the streak stays alive because it was the hit, not the error, that enabled Mattingly to reach first base safely. The error merely prolonged Mattingly's time up, in effect, giving him another chance for a hit that he still had to make. Had the pop-up been dropped in fair territory for an error, then Mattingly would have made it to first, but his hitting streak would not have made it to 31. QUESTION: An answer last month involving Wilt Chamberlain's averaging 50.4 points a game in the same season (1961-62) that Elgin Baylor averaged 38.3 got me to wondering: has anyone else averaged better than 35 points a game for a season? Only Rick Barry, but that singularity might end this season if Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls maintains his 37.3-point average. In 78 games during the 1966-67 season, Barry averaged 35.6 points with the San Francisco Warriors and led the National Basketball Association with 2,775 points. No wonder: he attempted 2,240 field goals, which was 541 more than any other player that season. Barry, recently elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame, averaged 24.8 points for his 14-year pro career. Baylor never again averaged 35 points or better in a season, but Chamberlain did it four other times on his way to a career average of 30.1 points. QUESTION: During the slam-dunk competition held before this season's N.B.A. All-Star Game, Michael Jordan, using a running start, made a shot after taking off from behind the foul line. If Jordan wanted to do this during a game, perhaps in order to make sure he didn't miss a crucial free throw, why couldn't he, since the ball would pass through the basket and hit the floor before he came down? Although free throws have been shot one-handed, two-handed, underhanded and overhanded, a player trying to slam-dunk a foul shot would be caught red-handed by the rule book. There is nothing wrong with leaving your feet to attempt a free throw, as in a jump shot, a style Hal Greer used years ago on the foul line. But the jump-foul-shooter has to stay behind the foul line. The rules prevent a free-throw shooter from crossing the plane of the line before the ball hits the rim or backboard. Otherwise, a violation would be called, the point would be erased and the ball would be turned over to the opposing team on the sideline. However, there's nothing wrong with a free-throw shooter moving forward and upward for the ball after it strikes the rim or backboard and ramming it home before he hits the ground. That play, of course, would be scored as a field goal worth 2 points and not a free throw worth 1. QUESTION: Who are the five women with the best times in the 1,500-meter run? Are any Americans among them? The top 10 in this outdoor event includes nine Soviet women and one Rumanian, Doina Melinte. The world- record holder is Tatyana Kazankina of the Soviet Union, whose time of 3 minutes 52.47 seconds was established in 1980. Next are four other Soviet runners: Olga Dvirna (3:54.23 in 1982), Zamira Zaytseva (3:56.14 in 1982), Tatyana Pozdnyakova (3:56.50 in 1982), and Nadezhda Raldagina (3:56.63 in 1984). The 11th best woman in the event - and also the best American - is Mary Decker Slaney, whose time of 3:57.12 in 1983 is nearly 4 1/2 seconds off the world mark. QUESTION: In the National Hockey League, how many players can a team carry on its roster and how many are eligible to play in a game? Technically, there is no league limit on the number of players on a team's roster, but realistically each team imposes a ceiling because there is a league limit on how many roster members can play in a game. Only 18 players are allowed to suit up for a game, plus two goaltenders. So teams generally carry a roster of 22 or 23 players, scratching two or three from each game, perhaps those still nursing injuries or those who have been ineffective of late. To carry more than that number on the roster would not only be an expense for the club, but also would be at the expense of the extra players, who could put the time to better use skating with a minor league affiliate instead of sitting with the parent club. QUESTION: In the bout in which Muhammad Ali beat Joe Frazier in Manila in their third heavyweight match, was Ali ahead on points at the time Frazier's corner stopped the fight before the final round? When Eddie Futch, Frazier's trainer, called it quits before the bell for round 15 - it was scored a 14th-round knockout for Ali - the defending champion Ali was decisively in front on the scorecards of the referee and the two judges, all of whom were from the Philippines. Under the 5-point must scoring system in which the winner of a round automatically earns 5 points, Referee Carlos Padilla Jr. had Ali ahead, 66-60; Judge Alfredo Quiazon had it 67-62 for Ali, and Judge Larry Nadayag 66-62 for the champion. On a rounds basis, Quiazon gave Ali 8 rounds, Frazier 3, with 3 even, and the others each had it 8-4-2 for Ali. Question Box is a regular feature of SportsMonday.

In ''Blue Mesa,'' a premiere, Mr. Wong creates the feeling of dance in a time and space as untroubled, for the most part, as the surface of still water. Much goes on in this ode to the primeval landscapes of the American West. A central figure moves through the piece as an archetypal American Indian, at one moment a bird, at other moments a ritualistic water bearer and figure of death and rebirth. And as he moves, he seems to draw forces of nature in around him, as other dancers, dressed in loose-fitting unitards that are softly striped like sand, join in this ritualistic evocation. ''Blue Mesa'' is intercut with films of actual mesas and a mysterious river bank, peopled by the Indian figure and six ceremonial figures who, in themselves, create a poetic landscape of the soul.",1987-03-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.What is the status of work on computer chips for applications in artificial intelligence? A.Computer scientists have been developing such microprocessor chips for several years. These chips are being designed to process a high-level computer programming language known as LISP, short for List Processing. The language is designed to enable a computer to mimic human perception and thinking processes, an application known as artificial intelligence. The new chips would replace the highly expensive artificial intelligence machines that have been designed to run LISP. Last week, Texas Instruments Inc. introduced the first version of a 32-bit microprocessor chip it has developed under a Defense Department contract. The 32-bit chip executes artificial intelligence programs more efficiently than the general-purpose devices. Motorola and Symbolics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., are also working on similar artificial intelligence chips. The chips promise to lead to computers that are faster and cheaper in performing such tasks as understanding language and in emulating human experts in such tasks as diagnosing diseases and offering investment advice. Such computers could solve problems using word-like symbols that allow them to ''think'' like people. Using such expert systems, the computers could find solutions to complex problems based on a variety of humans experiences found in the programs. Q.What causes blisters to form on the skin? A.Blisters are usually caused by friction or burns. In friction, the upper layers (epidermis) of the skin move back and forth over the lower layers (dermis), until a small cleft is produced between the layers of skin. Fluid collects in the cleft. When the skin is burned, serum from damaged blood vessels collects between the epidermis and the dermis. Blisters can also result from insect bites and minor bacterial and viral infections.",1987-03-03T05:00:00+0000

The memo was taken during a university investigation into charges that Yeoman and his assistants had paid players, in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. In the memorandum, taken last July 10, Yeoman defended his actions, saying the money was given in small amounts and generally for humanitarian purposes. The memo quoted Yeoman as saying he gave money to players for gas for their cars, utilities or rent for players' parents. ''For example, if one of the player's parents could not pay rent and were about to be evicted, Coach Yeoman would provide the money for that month's rent,'' the memorandum said. The former coach told the investigators some of the money came from his own pocket and occasionally he called on alumni to contribute. Yeoman, who coached the Cougars for 25 seasons, resigned at the end of last season and was replaced by Jack Pardee. ''I have no comment now, tomorrow, next week or next month,'' Yeoman said yesterday.

Jethroe Eisenstein, the lawyer, will attempt to persuade State Supreme Court Justice Elliot Wilk to lift a temporary injunction obtained on Dec. 22 by Home Box Office, the cable television network, to prevent a Spinks-Cooney fight until the then-I.B.F. champion had fulfilled his contractual obligation for a heavyweight-championship unification series televised by H.B.O. Spinks and his adviser and promoter, Butch Lewis, contend that, since Spinks is no longer the I.B.F. champion, he is free to fight Cooney in a lucrative fight not sanctioned as a title bout by the I.B.F., the World Boxing Association or the World Boxing Council, whose champions are in the tournament. Lewis also envisions a Spinks fight next September against Mike Tyson if the young W.B.C. champion emerges with the unified championship. Robert W. Lee, the I.B.F. president, announced that to fill his federation's vacant heavyweight crown, an immediate elimination series would begin by pitting Tucker, the No. 1 contender, against James (Buster) Douglas, with the winner to defend within six months against Carl (The Truth) Williams.

Dianne Wiest, dressed in white nightgown and socks, emerges from the shadows of a Lower East Side flat to deliver Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking soliloquy in a thick Eastern-European accent. Ms. Wiest is cast as a Polish emigre actress named Anka, and she wants us to see why her performance won awards in Warsaw. She also wants to demonstrate why there are no roles for her in New York. ''They say I have an awful accent,'' she says. Then she looks into the audience, curls her face into an imploring smile and inquires, ''Do I?''",1987-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Nov. 29: ''So, while we've been occupied with the Iranian issue over the past two weeks, let's not forget that there are many other issues that concern us.'' Dec. 1: ''If actions in implementing my policy were taken without my authorization, knowledge or concurrence, this will be exposed and appropriate corrective steps will be taken.'' Dec. 6: ''While we are still seeking all the facts, it's obvious that the execution of these policies was flawed and mistakes were made.'' Dec. 16: ''It is my desire to have the full story about Iran come out now - the alleged transfer of funds, the Swiss bank accounts, who was involved - everything.'' Jan. 27: ''But though we have made much progress, I have one major regret. I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I assume full responsibility. . . . We did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.'' Feb. 20: ''Try as I might, I cannot recall anything whatsoever about whether I approved an Israeli sale in advance or whether I approved replenishment of Israeli stocks around August of 1985. My answer therefore, and the simple truth is, I don't remember -period.'' Feb. 26: ''But I pledge to the American people today that I will do whatever is necessary to enact the proper reforms and to meet the challenges ahead.'' March 4: ''First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my Administration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior. And as personally distasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds, as the Navy would say, this happened on my watch.''",1987-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. My home has a large old porcelain sink with drain boards on each side. The porcelain is chipped in several places - some chips are about the size of a dime. Can an amateur refinish it? A.You can try touching up the chips with one of the porcelain touch-up kits sold by many hardware stores and dealers that carry appliance parts. The problem is how prominent the chips are, and whether the color will match the old porcelain. A two-part epoxy paint could also be used to repaint the entire sink. This requires very careful cleaning and preparation beforehand, especially around the drain fittings. Remember, once you paint, periodic repainting will be required. Q.The arm on my easy chair, which is covered with a vinyl upholstery, has a six-inch crack. Is there a preparation I can use to weld this crack? A.Several brands of vinyl cement, sold in most hardware stores and home centers, contain special solvents that weld breaks by partly dissolving the vinyl and then fusing the cracked vinyl together. However, for sizable jobs like yours the manufacturers usually recommend applying a patch of similar material behind the crack before cementing it. This may be difficult on a chair arm, but it is worth a try. Q.We just bought a five-year-old house with wood paneling on all the walls. Some paneling is light, which we prefer, but in several rooms it is very dark. We want to brighten it with whitewash or even paint, but we have never seen this done to paneling. What's possible? A.You can paint over the paneling just as you can over any other wall surface. However, make certain that all wax or polish is removed first. Wiping down with a rag dipped in paint thinner should do this, but change rags often. Apply an undercoat or sealer first, then a finish coat.",1987-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"Dining Out Guide; 3-Star French, Part I","This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. AURORA, 60 East 49th Street (692-9292) - (Jan. 31, 1986) Joseph Baum's provocative creation combines a cor porate ambiance of burnished wood wainscotting and plush leather chairs with a playful bubble theme carried out on plates, the waiters' jackets and elsewhere. The food can soar as high as bubbles on a windy day, and the menu changes frequently. First-rate starters napoleon of layered vegeta bles and mousse of zucchini with mari nated shrimp and lobster. For a main dish, game fanciers may enjoy the me dallions of venison with apricot, pear and chestnut sauce, and fresh pasta. Other options are lobster, poached with ginger, lime and Sauterne, and baked salmon with tomato butter, diced apple and vegetables. Main courses $28.50 to $34.50. Fridays, noon to 2:30 and 5:30 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA COTE BASQUE, #5 East 55th Street (688-6525) - (Aug. 22, 1986) The wrap around dining room of this bastion of classic French cuisine exudes a time less glamour with its murals of coastal France and splendid flower arrange ments. The cooking style is character ized by intensely reduced sauces, lav ish presentation and prodigious por tions. Starter choices include the sea food casserole, which changes daily, and cold poached salmon. Entrees fol low classic French cooking, from stuffed quail in pastry crust with truf fle sauce to sweetbreads of staggering size in a veal-stock sauce tinged with Madeira and garnished with pearl onions. Or you might choose grilled seafood, which is always good - sole, salmon and red snapper. Dinner prix fixe $48. Fridays, noon to 2:30 and 6 to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays, noon to 2:30 and 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA RESERVE, #4 West 49th Street (247- 2993) - (June 28, 1985) While the cook ing orientation here is classical, the touch is light and the two dining rooms with their beige- and peach-colored banquettes provide an enchanting backdrop for an excellent meal. You might begin with cream of lobster soup with basil; duck terrine with cumin and pistachio nuts, or a casserole of snails and wild mushrooms with garlic. For a main course, fish preparations are well focused, such as the grilled red snapper with tomato and herbs or poached Dover sole stuffed with arti choke mousse. Or choose roast duck with guava and rosemary, and sweet bread scallops with mustard seeds and red peppers. Dinner prix fixe $42. Fri days, noon to 3 and 5:30 to 11 P.M.; Sat urdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA TULIPE, #104 West 13th Street (691- 8860) - (March 1, 1985) This charm ing and intimate Greenwich Village restaurant with its Parisian-style bar up front, chocolate colored walls and graceful tulip sconces has maintained its high standards over the years. The chef stresses flavor over flashiness, and appetizer selections include ce viche of salmon with fresh tomato sauce and wild mushroom soup. En trees are nearly always well con ceived: Slices of grilled squab with chartreuse of vegetables and braised cabbage; confit of duck with lentils; red snapper in parchment with herbs and vegetables, and lobster on a bed of pasta and brunoise of vegetables. Din ner prix fixe $57. Fridays through Sun days, 6:30 to 10 P.M. LE CIRQUE, #58 East 65th Street (794-9292) - (Sept. 19, 1986) There is indeed something magical about dining at this classically elegant East Side restau rant - certainly the food and service is of the highest quality rich and fa mous sit elbow-to-elbow on banquettes, but the experience is grander than the sum of its parts. The extensive menu is all in French, and starters are ceviche of red-snapper fillet in vinaigrette with red and yellow peppers or one of the changing daily pastas. You can't go wrong with the meticulously prepared grilled and sauteed selections, Dover sole with mustard sauce or paillard of beef or veal. Game birds are a spe cialty and the roast pigeon surrounded with shredded cabbage is a delight. Dinner entrees $20.25 to $27.75. Fri days and Saturdays, noon to 2:30 and 6 to 10:30 P.M.; closed Sundays. What the stars mean, page COO.",1987-03-06T05:00:00+0000

About 300 of the more than 500 people on board were reported rescued, and an undetermined number were trapped inside. Page 1 In Zeebrugge, signs of a catastrophe were everywhere, as policemen and emergency workers scrambled to cope with the British ferry disaster in the Belgian port. 1 George Shultz will go to Moscow in April to discuss a proposed treaty on medium-range arms, a possible summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev and other Soviet-American issues. 1 The chief Soviet arms negotiator said he believed the United States and the Soviet Union would agree by the summer to eliminate their medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe. 5 Body-builders in a Moscow suburb have become a sensation since a weekly magazine asserted that a fearsome gang of teen-age vigilantes had arisen from the suburb's underground weight-lifting rooms. 1 A pledge to democratize South Korea was reaffirmed by President Chun Doo Hwan after being pressed by Secretary of State George Shultz. He pledged to hold free elections and leave office next February. 3 Philippine rebels will not negotiate soon and have begun to increase the level of violence, one of the leaders said. She said she thought the President had for now lost a chance for a peaceful breakthrough. 2 Bank records of Nicaraguan rebels indicate payments of $16 million to U.S. brokers for weapons during a ban on direct military aid and deposits from a Swiss bank account controlled by Oliver North. 8 News analysis: Israel's image in the U.S. has been tarnished by the sentencing of an American for spying for Israel, the indictment of an Israeli Air Force officer on espionage charges and the Iran-contra affair. 4 The deployment of Syrian troops in mainly Moslem West Beirut has increased pressure in the Christian part of the city for militiamen to step aside and turn their positions over to the Lebanese army. 2 A new voice of Peronism is filling Argentine airwaves with a passionate defense of workers' rights. Labor leader Saul Ubaldini is the most visible adversary of President Raul Alfonsin's economic proposals. 3 Jerusalem Journal 4 Israelis press leaders on spy case 4 Security inquiry in Washington 6 NATIONAL 7-10, 28 Changes in economic priorities of the Administration may result from Donald T. Regan's departure as chief of staff, according to Administration and Congressional officials. 1 The President's support of the report by the Tower commission, including its criticism of George P. Shultz and Caspar W. Weinberger, was reaffirmed by the White House. 8 Oliver North filed a second lawsuit against Edwin Meese 3d and the special prosecutor in the Iran-arms affair, charging that the Attorney General could not grant Justice Department powers to the prosecutor. 8 Robert McFarlane's home telephone may have been tapped by a Government intelligence agency after he resigned as President Reagan's national security advisor, intelligence sources said. 8 The judge who banned 35 textbooks in Alabama because he said they unconstitutionally promoted the ''religion of secular humanism'' was already a hero to the religious right for earlier decisions. 7 A Detroit plane crash inquiry is handicapped by the lack of crash recorders on smaller airliners, the National Transportation Safety Board chairman said. The plane, carrying 16 passengers, crashed Wednesday. 7 Bob Dole is building a campaign organization rapidly for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination to take advantage of Vice President Bush's political troubles stemming from the Iran arms affair. 7 George Bush fielded questions at a Republican gathering on the second day of a campaign swing through Iowa. Not one touched on the Iran controversy and the Vice President did little to volunteer anything. 7 Many new jobs were created last month but not enough to push the unemployment rate below 6.6 percent, the Labor Department reported. The figures were stronger than generally expected. 10 Efforts to end Amtrak's subsidies were renewed by the Reagan Administration, as a panel was named to study the matter. Members of Congress and others praised the move but faulted its objectives. 9 A pledge that S.M.U. would obey N.C.A.A. rules was broken by Bill Clements, now the Governor of Texas, when he authorized the continuation of payments to football players, the director of enforcement for the N.C.A.A. charged. 1 A.T.&T. asked Federal authorities to remove earning limits on its long-distance service. It also proposed that it no longer have to prove that changes in long-distance rates are necessary or reasonable. 35 Meese overruled on Nixon papers 7 Everest may take second place 9 REGIONAL 29-32 50 New York prisoners with AIDS have been paroled early because of their disease, according to parole officials. The policy pits the inmates' rights to privacy against the need to protect public health. 1 Violence among cocaine users and a condition known as cocaine psychosis is increasing in New York and other cities where crack use has become widespread, police and drug treatment experts say. 29 New York's housing chief denied that his state agency improperly reduced a backlog of 100,000 tenant-landlord disputes, and discounted allegations that the state's administration of rent laws was in chaos. 31 The PCB-contaminated wells of West Amwell, N.J., have the local residents worried about their health, livestock and property values. Health officials continued to test wells there. 30 Beach erosion in New Jersey is permanently changing the state's coastline, forcing government officials and environmental experts into a quandary and threatening the tourist industry and private investment. 29 Big East tickets scarce 29 Consent at issue in Baby M trial 30 Gotti case goes to jury 31 Deal on charges in racial attack 31 Study cites decline in black men 31",1987-03-07T05:00:00+0000

It is the only Catholic college in the United States that receives Vatican accreditation, and Father Curran has been a tenured full professor there since 1971. In his suit, filed in Superior Court of the District of Columbia and made public last week, Father Curran contends that most of the students in his classes were civil-degree candidates, not enrolled in Vatican-accredited programs, and that therefore his role as a teacher should not be subject to Vatican regulation. One purpose of tenure, he said, is ''to grant to the recipient academic freedom, freedom of thought and expression, and freedom of inquiry in his academic pursuits, without fear of reprisal.''",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

Neither man ever claims a breakthrough or settles for a stalemate. It might be said that their success lies largely in their avoidance of failure. Similarly, Mr. Blessing's play (at the Yale Repertory Theater) is distinguished, first of all, by the pitfalls it avoids. The play, inspired by the real ''walk in the woods'' taken in 1982 by Paul H. Nitze and Yuli A. Kvitsinsky, is neither a polemic nor a cartoon, but an engrossing attempt to humanize a situation of awesome portentousness.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,'THE GIRL FROM FARGO': A PLAY,"The editors of Arts and Leisure asked the playwrights Terrence McNally and Wendy Wasserstein to explain how a play gets from an Off Broadway producer's office to the stage. They responded in the medium in which they felt most comfortable. The result, ''Wendy Wasserstein's and Terrence McNally's 'The Girl From Fargo, North Dakota,' '' a one-act play in four scenes, is their first collaboration. THE PLAYERS JONATHAN SHARPE, Off Broadway's youngest leading artistic director/producer VERA-ELLEN ALLEN, a young playwright from Fargo, North Dakota MICHAEL TRUCK, an angry young playwright A. ROB ''BECKETT'' STERN, a promising young dramaturg MUFFIE CRAIN, a lonely young casting director TREVIS HAMMOND-STRUT, a hot young British director. Has eight plays running on Off and Off Off Broadway CARDINALE DI BENEDETTO, the brilliant young conceptual designer LUCY BALLOT, a promising young National Endowment for the Arts consultant BOBBIE POWELL, a young, no-nonsense stage manager CUBBY DUMOND, a promising youngish lady chairperson of JONATHAN SHARPE'S board NORTH, a cute intern. Also a senior at Phillips Exeter Academy SCENE ONE The time is now. JONATHAN SHARPE'S crowded office in the West 40's between 10th and 11th Avenues. The walls are covered with theatrical posters. Desks are piled high with play scripts. Photographs of now-famous Academy Award winners when they were young, eager and waiters are everywhere. MICHAEL TRUCK, the angry young playwright, has JONATHAN SHARPE, Off Broadway's youngest leading artistic director/ producer, in a hammerlock. MUFFIE CRAIN, the lonely young casting director, continues to cast at her Macintosh computer, oblivious to their struggle. MICHAEL TRUCK: You promised to produce my next play! Well, ''Drop Dead'' is my next play! JONATHAN SHARPE:: Michael, I can't produce a five-hour, 80-character Purim play on my budget. MUFFIE CRAIN: (working at her computer) Molly Ringwald is available! MICHAEL TRUCK: Sigourney Weaver is committed to ''Drop Dead''! JONATHAN: I'll be committed if I produce it. I'm sorry, Michael, but I have to worry about the future of the American Theater. MICHAEL: Wait till I tell the National Endowment for the Arts about this, Judas. Good thing my mother-in-law is lunching with Kitty Carlisle Hart. I'll have your funding on a platter! (NORTH, a cute young intern, enters with a bucket and mop. MUFFIE looks up from her Macintosh.) NORTH: I finished the men's room. Now what? JONATHAN: The women's room. (NORTH exits.) MUFFIE: That North kid is adorable! JONATHAN: He's a senior at Exeter, Muffie! MUFFIE: Well, you don't meet that many real men around here. I wonder if he has a trust fund. I wouldn't mind getting out of this business. (VERA-ELLEN ALLEN, the young playwright from Fargo, North Dakota, enters. She carries two suitcases and a large Teddy bear.) VERA-ELLEN ALLEN: Hi, I'm Vera-Ellen Allen, the young playwright from Fargo, North Dakota. Am I interrupting? JONATHAN: Mr. Truck is just leaving. VERA-ELLEN: You're Michael Truck? I loved ''Go to Hell.'' MICHAEL: You see, Jonathan? (To VERA-ELLEN) Let me give you a tip, honey. Don't let these people produce your play. Go right to the top, take it to Circle Rep! (He storms out) VERA-ELLEN: He seems nice. (She looks around the room.) So this is the theater! JONATHAN: (He puts his hand over a leak.) Did you have a nice trip? VERA-ELLEN: The bus broke down in Harrisburg so I hitched the rest of the way on a Diesel truck. The driver was real nice and handsome and wanted to marry me. MUFFIE: Maybe I should start hitchhiking. We love your play, Miss Allen. VERA-ELLEN: Call me Vera-Ellen. MUFFIE: It's just wonderful. VERA-ELLEN: You are really nice. JONATHAN: Usually we develop a script. You know, readings, staged readings, semi-staged readings, semi-seated readings, semi-seated standing readings . . . VERA-ELLEN: That sounds really nice. JONATHAN: However, when your play ''Isn't It Nice?'' came in through the Young Playwrights Festival sponsored by the Dramatists Guild, Peter Stone, president; David E. LeVine, executive director, I recognized a freshness and an urgency that I don't want to tamper with. Our promising young dramaturg, A. Rob ''Beckett'' Stern, has a few thoughts for rewrites he'd like to share with you. (A. ROB enters with a copy of VERA-ELLEN'S script.) A. ROB ''BECKETT'' STERN: Here's your play. The red markings are what you should cut, the pink markings are what doesn't work, and the blue markings need a total rewrite. And by the way, there's a big problem in your second act. I don't know what it is, but I'm not a playwright. Excuse me, I've got to get back to my translation of ''Woyzeck Tonight!'' (He exits.) VERA-ELLEN: He seems nice. JONATHAN: He isn't. About a director: we've sent it to Mike Nichols, Tommy Tune, Mr. Abbott, Susan Sontag - she's looking for a comedy - Sean Penn . . . it's a wild card . . . and Pina Bausch . . . that one's out of the ballpark. VERA-ELLEN: They all sound very nice, I'm sure. (TREVIS HAMMOND-STRUT, the hot young British director, flies into the office.) TREVIS HAMMOND-STRUT: Hello, darlings! I'm directing your play. Mike, Tommy, Susan and Pina all turned it down. But I love it. Now here's my schedule: I'm opening ''Mother Courage'' at the Public and then I'm off to L.A. for ''When We Dead Awaken.'' I can squeeze you in between the Mamet and the Miller. We'll talk. (He flies out of the office.) VERA-ELLEN: He seems very nice. MUFFIE: About casting: your play has wonderful parts for four women. I think we could even interest someone like Meryl to return to the stage. VERA-ELLEN: Meryl Streep! MUFFIE: (at her computer) Well, if not Meryl, Kathleen Turner is available. Or Swoosie Kurtz. Or Stockard Channing. Or Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio . . . or . . . you're in luck! They're all available. Every actress in America. VERA-ELLEN: And they'd all be willing to work Off Broadway? MUFFIE: That's what they tell us. JONATHAN: Whether stars do it or not, Vera-Ellen, I'm committed to your play. At my theater the playwright is the star. Your work is very exciting and it's hard to get excited in the theater these days. (Gunshots are heard offstage. NORTH rushes in.) NORTH: Michael Truck just shot himself. (He points at VERA-ELLEN.) He blames you and the American theater. VERA-ELLEN: I just got here! (Blackout.) SCENE TWO The same. Six weeks later. JONATHAN is with CARDINALE DI BENEDETTO, the brilliant young conceptual designer, and CUBBY DUMOND, a promising youngish lady chairperson on his board. JONATHAN: I'm sorry, Card, but I just can't afford to build a real bridge over water. This isn't the Yale Drama School. CARDINALE: My art isn't cheap! JONATHAN: Well, it has to be if you're going to work at my theater. (Enter BOBBIE POWELL, a young, no-nonsense stage manager.) BOBBIE: Jonathan, we have only $10.87 left in our production budget. We can't continue. (She exits. Plaster falls from the ceiling.) CUBBY DUMOND: If you'd do more musicals, the board could raise more money. All our friends like musicals. And why can't the theater be on the East Side near McMullen's? They serve such nice grilled fish. You drag us to the West Side and make us sit through dreadful Michael Truck plays. Why can't you do a nice play? JONATHAN: I am doing a nice play. It's called ''Isn't It Nice?'' CUBBY: Who's in it? JONATHAN: The four Christines: Lahti, Baranski, Ebersole and Estabrook. CUBBY: You promised us Meryl Streep this season. CARDINALE: He promised me a bridge! I'm going to the Manhattan Theater Club. (He exits as NORTH enters with a bucket and mop.) NORTH: I finished the ladies' room. Now what? JONATHAN: The men's room. NORTH: (to CUBBY) Hi, Mom. CUBBY: I thought you were at Exeter this semester. (VERA-ELLEN, TRAVIS, MUFFIE and A. ROB enter in high dudgeon.) TREVIS: The show is off! The Christines quit. All four of them. They all got TV pilots. JONATHAN: Relax, Trevis, we'll recast it. Muffie, check on the availability of Whoopi Goldberg. MUFFIE: She's doing ''Mother Courage'' for Joe Papp. TREVIS: Who's directing it? Oh, my God, I am. A. ROB: I've got it! Cut the four women out of your play. VERA-ELLEN: They're the only four characters in my play. (MICHAEL TRUCK enters. His head is bandaged. With him is LUCY BALLOT, a promising young National Endowment for the Arts consultant.) MICHAEL: There they are! Cut their funding! LUCY: Mr. Truck says you're not committed to new American plays. JONATHAN: I'm a reasonable, intelligent man. Why would I be working in this dump for no money dealing with people like Michael Truck and actresses who quit to be in TV pilots and board members who want me to put on musicals if I weren't committed to new American plays? I live, breathe, eat and sleep new American plays. (More plaster falls.) CUBBY: Bravo, Jonathan! VERA-ELLEN: Hello, I'm Vera-Ellen Allen, the playwright. I'm having a wonderful experience at this theater. I'm learning so much about my play, its structure, its language, its dramatic arc. Please don't cut their funding. Please support them. LUCY: We'd love to give you more but we're running out of money ourselves. CUBBY: Then once again it's up to the private sector. (She stuffs money into JONATHAN'S pockets. MICHAEL TRUCK shoots himself again. No one cares. NORTH rushes in.) NORTH: There's a riot down there. Four hundred waitresses from Curtain Up are demanding to audition for ''Isn't It Nice?'' VERA-ELLEN: Then the show will go on! TREVIS: Darlings, I can only give you four days. A. ROB: I still say this play should have been workshopped. (Blackout.) SCENE THREE The same. Four days later. Opening night. JONATHAN, VERA-ELLEN, MUFFIE, A. ROB and TREVIS are pacing nervously. JONATHAN: Sshh! I thought I heard a laugh from the theater. (NORTH enters breathlessly with binoculars.) NORTH: I found him in the audience. He's in the fourth-row aisle seat. He still hasn't laughed but he's writing a lot. JONATHAN: Don't take your eyes off him. (NORTH rushes out.) JONATHAN: Why are we so victimized by the critics? I'm not inviting them after this. VERA-ELLEN: Then how will my play get to Broadway? JONATHAN: I don't care if your play gets to Broadway. I'm committed to new American voices. VERA-ELLEN: Well, I care. Shoot, we had a nicer theater than this in Fargo. (A light fixture falls down. NORTH rushes back into the room.) NORTH: Edith Oliver went out for a cigarette. (He rushes back to the theater.) TREVIS: Maybe the critics know something we don't know. VERA-ELLEN: You mean, you don't like my play? TREVIS: Well, do you think it's a good play? I'm off, luvs. Good luck with it, darling. Ta ta. VERA-ELLEN: This play has to be a success. They've already taken my picture for Vanity Fair. (NORTH enters breathlessly.) NORTH: His wife is smiling. Or maybe she was yawning. (He rushes out.) VERA-ELLEN: (starting to cry) I just don't know what I'm going to do if they don't like it! I'll be so humiliated. That's me up there. My life. My feelings. My parents. JONATHAN: It's a wonderful play, Vera-Ellen. VERA-ELLEN: I know that! I'm talking about having a hit. JONATHAN: If it's a hit you want, you're in the wrong business. It's not who likes it, it's how it touches people. VERA-ELLEN: Will you lighten up? Hits touch people. They made a movie of ''Crimes of the Heart.'' Who is Beth Henley's agent? (NORTH rushes in.) NORTH: Listen to this! (He throws open the door. Shouts of ''Bravo.'' A great ovation is coming from the theater.) Even the critics are giving it a standing ovation. Everybody's saying what a terrific movie it will make. I'd like to buy the rights. (MICHAEL TRUCK enters.) MICHAEL: They loved it! They loved it! (He opens fire. Blackout.) SCENE FOUR Epilogue. One year later. NORTH'S office in Hollywood. NORTH is dictating to his secretary, BOBBIE POWELL, who has gone Hollywood in a big way. NORTH: Michael Truck won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Drop Dead.'' Get the film rights. I'll give Vera-Ellen first crack at a first draft. Have we fired Trevis Hammond-Strut off the Marsha Norman project yet? Well, do it now. Tell Meryl it's a go on ''Three Sisters'' with her, Barbra and Goldie. How were the ratings on ''The Four Christines''? Who said America wasn't ready for a sitcom about four struggling young actresses? (MUFFIE and CUBBY enter. They have been shopping.) Hi, Mom. Hi, honey. MUFFIE: Darling, your mother and I both think you should finish high school. NORTH: Why? I'm getting an honorary degree from Harvard. CUBBY: This is all that horrible little theater's fault! (A. ROB enters with a script.) A. ROB: I've got it! Bruce Willis in ''Woyzek Tonight!'' It's a natural mini-series! NORTH: You're fired! (A bedraggled VERA-ELLEN enters.) VERA-ELLEN: Here's my 11th draft of ''Isn't It Nice?'' Screenwriting is real hard. (JONATHAN enters with great enthusiasm.) JONATHAN: I just saw a great new play at a storefront theater in Hollywood. I think it will be terrific for us in New York. NORTH: I flew you out here to develop movie projects for me. JONATHAN: I'm sorry, North, but I'm going back. I belong in the theater. NORTH: You're walking away from a fortune. JONATHAN: I know and I don't look forward to begging for money, sweating out opening nights, the angry subscribers, the disappointments, the feeling sometimes that nobody cares anymore. But when I go into a theater I still get goosebumps. When the lights go down, my pulse races. I always expect the miracle to happen. I know: lighten up! But I just want to put on plays, I always have, since I had a puppet theater in the basement. NORTH: You had a puppet theater in the basement? So did I! VERA-ELLEN: Me, too. MUFFIE, CUBBY, BOBBIE & A. ROB: So did we! VERA-ELLEN: Jonathan, I'd like to go back to the theater with you, if you'll have me. JONATHAN: Come on, Vera-Ellen, let's go to New York, clean out those bathrooms and put on a new show. (They start walking off.) VERA-ELLEN: I want to write my ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' my ''Harvey,'' my ''Little Foxes.'' MUFFIE: And I want to cast my ''Glass Menagerie,'' my ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' Wait for me! CUBBY: I want to nurture my ''Barefoot in the Park,'' my ''Front Page.'' Oh, God, I'm coming, too! A. ROB: I want to dramaturg my ''Hurlyburly.'' Wait! BOBBIE: What about me? I want to stage manage my ''Chorus Line''! NORTH: Why are you doing this to me? I'm too young to be idealistic. (He breaks down and cries.) ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad.'' Don't leave me! (He rushes after the others.) JONATHAN: (from offstage) I want to find my ''Crucible,'' my ''Fifth of July,'' my ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains it All for You,' my ''Oklahoma'' . . . ! (His voice fades away. The stage is empty.

Harrison, is among the pivotal works of modern architecture in America.

us,IN SHORT: NON-FICTION,"THE INSANITY FILE: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln. By Mark E. Neely Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry. (Southern Illinois University, $19.95.) One of the saddest stories in the Lincoln family saga unfolds in detail for the first time in ''The Insanity File'' - the 1875 jury trial to declare Mary Todd Lincoln insane and the role played in it by Robert Todd Lincoln, her firstborn and only surviving son. To Robert fell the unhappy task of having his mother declared insane to protect her from harming herself and to conserve her estate. Documents pertaining to the case had been secreted in his country house in Vermont. A few years ago, they were turned over to two respected Lincoln scholars, Mark E. Neely Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry, by Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, President Lincoln's last direct descendant. In a foreword, written before his death in 1985, Mr. Beckwith explains why he decided to let the details emerge: ''I believe that because of this file history will treat my great-grandmother Mary Todd Lincoln more kindly in regard to this very disturbing period of her life and most of all recognize that my grandfather acted in the best possible way towards his mother.'' The authors help answer the question: Should Robert have subjected his mother to humiliation and himself to heartache? They also discuss Illinois's liberal insanity laws, which required a jury trial to declare a person insane, and its property laws, which were harsher on women than on men. The story's sad conclusion: after spending several months in a sanitarium, Mary Todd Lincoln lived out her final years with a beloved sister in Springfield, Ill.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

''The David Letterman Story'' is just the kind of disposable product that the television talk-show host gives away to members of his audience in return for their contributions to, say, a ''Brush With Greatness'' segment of ''Late Night With David Letterman.'' The book's ridiculous quality is not entirely the fault of Caroline Latham, the co-author of ''Rose Kennedy.'' When she conscientiously narrates the events of Mr. Letterman's life and analyzes his success, she sounds like the sort of person the star makes fun of on television. When she tries to mimic the cheeky, wiseacre tone of the show, there is an edge of desperation in her voice. Her view of Mr. Letterman's humor - his rude, self-conscious but oddly cheerful deprecation of television's follies - is just accurate enough to explain why the book has no discernible audience: if Mr. Letterman's fans are as hip as she says they are, they are not likely to be in the market for quickie biographies. And her conclusion - that Mr. Letterman's television persona is a perfect reflection of the real David Letterman - is believable: he is as unmysterious a figure as television has to offer. But, then, why do we need a star biography? The interesting thing about ''The David Letterman Story'' is that in a way its subject would probably appreciate, it blurts out what it is: a Brush With Exploitation, publishing-style.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

Tibbett's portrayal is something out of the ordinary; Ezio Pinza is a magnificent opponent for him as Fiesco.

So Alabama, if it chose, could establish a state religion. Predictably, the Supreme Court reversed him on that point, unanimously, and struck down a school prayer composed by the governor and a ''moment of silence'' law intended as prayer. Judge Hand threatened at the time that if reversed, he might outlaw textbooks he deemed hostile to religion. Now he's done just that. His verbose, 111-page opinion makes no more constitutional sense than his earlier judgments but its effect is, at least temporarily, more serious. Alabama authorities have already started to remove schoolbooks the judge found inspired by ''secular humanism.'' The judge is right when he says a textbook that fails to make clear that the Pilgrims were religious is a deficient textbook. He's remarkably misguided when he says such a textbook amounts to an unconstitutional promotion of the secular humanist ''religion.''",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,A TALE OF MYSTERY AND SUSPENSION,"The engineers who mastered the North American continent with railroads, dams, canals and bridges, last century and this, are among the great unsung national heroes. For the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, John van der Zee tells the story of the structure's creation, and while its realization was a complicated act of finance, politics and architecture, it was, above all, a masterpiece of engineering. Until THE GATE: The True Story of the Design and Construction of the Golden Gate Bridge (Simon & Schuster, $19.95), however, the authorship of its structural design was obscured by the practice - still common among many design firms - of attributing credit to the head of the firm responsible for the project. Joseph Strauss, of the J. B. Strauss Company of Chicago, indeed was the bridge's great promoter. But the book - organized like a whodunit - reveals that neither Strauss nor the famous New York engineers who worked as consultants really engineered the bridge. It was a professor from the University of Illinois who came to work on the bridge for the Strauss firm, and was dismissed after it was designed. This is a story of passions and the slide rule - of the exquisitely fragile moments when an engineer plumbs the subtle, not completely understood nature of a structure, and of credit for the results. The author of works of fiction and nonfiction, Mr. van der Zee shows us how the professor, Charles Alton Ellis, expanded knowledge of suspension bridges by his work on the Golden Gate and even discovered, after being pulled off the job, a flaw lurking in the concepts on which the calculations were based. The book is not only a tribute to what the author calls ''a democratic masterpiece.'' It also sets the record straight: it was Ellis who did it.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"THAT BOWLING ALLEY ON THE TIBER: Tales of a Director, by Michelangelo Antonioni. Translated by William Arrowsmith. (Oxford University, $7.95.) The film director offers a collection of 33 mood pieces that our reviewer, Stephen Schiff, described in 1985 as ''literary doodles for films he never made.'' The sketches ''are sometimes mere fripperies, but at their best they are something more - plangent, haunting and refreshingly tough-minded.'' They can also be seen as ''a record of the fiction-making impulse'' and an attempt to claw toward the truth beneath the filmic appearance. MONKEYS, by Susan Minot. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $5.95.) Susan Minot's chronicle of an upper-middle-class New England family with seven children is ''a rare book - a subtle, funny and often extremely moving first novel,'' A. R. Gurney Jr. said in The Book Review last year. Set between 1966 and 1979, the book consists of nine sections, each devoted to an important incident in the Vincents' lives and seen mostly through the eyes of Sophie, one of the daughters. The author ''conveys the special texture of life in a large family,'' the reviewer said. DANCE: A Short History of Classic Theatrical Dancing, by Lincoln Kirstein. (Dance Horizons/Princeton Book Company, $15.95.) This history of classic theatrical dancing traces the art from its primitive ritual origins to modern times. Reviewers in 1936 found it a work of ''intelligence, scholarship and taste,'' and particularly eloquent in discussing the Renaissance beginnings of ballet. While Mr. Kirstein places the dance works themselves at the center of his analysis, another approach can be found in Walter Sorell's DANCE IN ITS TIME (Morningside/Columbia University, $14.50), a history of dance in its literary, artistic and sociopolitical context. Anna Kisselgoff, writing in The Times in 1981, said ''Mr. Sorell has researched an enormous amount and this is the first dance-related book to bring so many threads together.'' COUNTRY COUSINS, by Michael Brownstein. (Sun & Moon Press, $11.95.) Martin Kilbanky, the lunatic, sex-crazed hero of this novel set in 1959, has come into a fortune and sets about satisfying his two obsessions - his dream of building a house, and the body of his best friend's wife. In 1974 our reviewer, Karyl Roosevelt, noted the book's ''manic vitality'' and called it an example of ''fiction that is well crafted and yet experimental enough'' to be seen as ''completely original.'' BATTLES OF LIFE AND DEATH, by David Hellerstein. (Warner, $6.95.) A young doctor's casebook, ''Battles of Life and Death'' consists of 13 true stories -about a burn victim, cancer and stroke patients, a kidney-transplant recipient and others - from the author's medical school and residency experiences. Last year our reviewer, Mike Oppenheim, said most of the cases ''make stomach-churning, horrific reading,'' but admired two of the entries, particularly one about trying to reform an incompetent second-year resident, written ''with genuine insight and compassion.'' A PUZZLE FOR FOOLS, by Patrick Quentin. (Penguin, $5.95.) Patrick Quentin was the pen name of Hugh Callingham Wheeler, who switched to playwriting later in life and, under his own name, wrote the books for such Broadway productions as ''A Little Night Music,'' ''Candide'' and ''Sweeney Todd.'' ''A Puzzle for Fools'' (written in collaboration with Richard Wilson Webb, as were all the ''Quentin'' murder mysteries until 1952) introduces Peter Duluth, an alcoholic who gets involved in sleuthing after a series of murders at the expensive sanitarium where he is drying out. In 1936 our reviewer, Isaac Anderson, said the hospital, ''with its slightly mad patients and its coldly scientific medical staff, makes an excellent setting . . . and the author has used it to the best advantage.'' The same publisher has reissued two more Peter Duluth mysteries, PUZZLE FOR FIENDS and PUZZLE FOR PILGRIMS ($5.95 each). In the first, the amnesiac Duluth finds himself in a household of calculating women who insist he is their son, brother and husband. ''The sultry beauties and cushy California setting make this diablerie good warm weather diversion,'' Mr. Anderson said here in 1946. In ''Pilgrims,'' Duluth's unfaithful spouse is among the suspects when her lover's wife dies in a fall. ''What a predicament for an amateur detective!'' Mr. Anderson said here in 1947. BREAKING THE SILENCE, by Walter Laqueur and Richard Breitman. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) The authors reconstruct the life of Eduard Schulte (1891-1966), the German industrialist who tried in the early 1940's - vainly - to alert the Allies that the Nazis intended to exterminate Europe's Jews. The tale is told resourcefully, Henry Ashby Turner said here last year, but despite the authors' efforts, ''the man himself remains elusive.'' VILLAGE SCHOOL, by ''Miss Read.'' (Academy Chicago, $6.95.) Dora Jessie Saint, under the pen name Miss Read, has written some two dozen novels of the bygone days of English country life. The first, ''Village School,'' describes a year in the life of the headmistress of a school in a remote hamlet. A work of ''charm and grace,'' the book ''lingers in one's mind as something true, rare and lovely,'' Mary Ellen Chase said in The Book Review in 1956. The same publisher has reissued VILLAGE DIARY ($6.95), which continues the headmistress' chronicle of life at the school and in the village of Fairacre. The same reviewer in 1957 said the ''author has many wise things to say about the changing face of English village life.'' LIBERTY, A BETTER HUSBAND. Single Women in America: The Generations of 1780-1840, by Lee Virginia Chambers-Schiller. (Yale University, $11.95.) This history of the lives and works of more than 100 single women in antebellum America focuses on middle- and upper-class Northeasterners.

The 29-year-old Harvey, whose best previous high in a World Cup race had been a fourth-place finish, was timed in 1 hour 17 minutes 46.5 seconds. Aleksei Prokurorov of the Soviet Union was second in 1:18:58.4.(AP) HIGH SCHOOLS Stevenson and Lincoln Advance: Stevenson of the Bronx and Lincoln of Brooklyn advanced to the Public Schools Athletic League basketball championship tournament.

Lynch and Galeano Impressive: Nnenna Lynch and Joe Galeano were among the impressive winning performers at the New York State Interscholastic Boys and Girls indoor track and field championships in Cornell's Barton Hall at Ithaca, N.Y. Nnenna, a 15-year-old sophomore at Manhattan's Hunter College High School, won the girls' 1,000- and 1,500-meter runs in the space of a little over two hours. She was timed in 2 minutes 51.96 seconds for the 1,000 and at 4:39.46 in the 1,500 as she led in both races from start to finish. Nnenna duplicated the double victory of her sister, Shola, in last year's title meet. Shola, a senior at Hunter who won the 600 and 1,000 in 1986, was ineligible for the meet because she did not participate in any of four qualifying meets. Galeano, a senior a Long Island's Centereach High School, won the 55-meter high hurdles in the meet and state record time of 7.22 seconds and the high jump at 6 feet 10 inches.

Battle Man, the runner-up, finished five lengths ahead of the favorite, Z. Plasty. Why Not Try, a son of Cutlass and the Peace Corps mare Soon I Hope, was timed 1:10 3/5 for his fourth consecutive victory.(AP) Demons Begone Wins: Demons Begone, one of the top 2-year-olds in the country last year, stamped himself as a stong Kentucky Derby contender with an easy victory in the $59,900-added Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark. Demons Begone, who had not raced in four months, circled the leaders on the turn and coasted home eight lengths in front of Wayne's Crane. The time for the mile was 1:34 3/5, one fifth off the track record, and jockey Pat Day never whipped the winner. (AP) LUGE Masley Takes National Title: Frank Masley of Newark, Del., won the national championship at Lake Placid, N.Y., his fourth national title since 1979.

In the women's division, Bonny Warner of Mount Baldy, Calif. captured her third national championship in 1:19.810.(AP) GOLF Langer Leads by 2: The $600,000 Honda Classic may come down to a battle between the two most prominent cross-handed putters on the PGA Tour: Bernhard Langer of West Germany vs. Bruce Lietzke of Oklahoma. Through the third round, Langer had the edge because he dropped a 12-foot birdie putt with a cross-hand stroke on the 15th green to break a tie for the lead. Then he parred the 18th where Lietzke took a bogey. That sent Langer into today's final round with a two-shot lead over Lietzke and Mark Calcavecchia, a standard-grip putter, who birdied No. 17 to move up with Lietzke. Langer, who led Lietzke by two shots when the rain-delayed third round began on the 7,037-yard Tournament Players Club at Eagle Trace in Coral Springs, Fla., shot two-under 70 for a 54-hole score of nine-under 207. Lietzke had 70 for 208 and Calcavecchia, who caddied for Ken Green in the Honda a year ago, had 68-209.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

Ryan of California, who was there to look into reports that cult members were being prevented from leaving the settlement known as Jonestown. Three journalists and a would-be cult defector were also shot down, and Mr. Jones and more than 900 members of his People's Temple killed themselves by swallowing a soft drink spiked with cyanide. Chief Judge Robert F. Peckham, who held Mr. Jones ''primarily responsible'' for the carnage, said Mr. Layton would be eligible for parole after five years instead of the customary 10.

Indian law may be the most arcane area of constitutional law. Subject to Federal control but technically separate nations, Indian tribes are political and legal anomalies. As analyzed by Charles F. Wilkinson, a professor of law at the University of Oregon, the basic question of modern Indian law has been how to honor half-forgotten treaty promises. During the last century, as many Indians blended with white society, tribes seemed to fade into near oblivion. Since 1959, however, the Supreme Court has made new law - and revived Indian culture - by reshaping treaty rights to fit modern realities. The Court has reiterated the view that tribes are sovereign entities; their powers existed before white settlement and have not lapsed with the passage of time. Decisions on land, water and fishing rights have given Indians a financial base; other rulings have swept state law from the reservations, so that tribal councils can levy taxes and set up their own courts. Thanks to the Court and to Indian activists, tribes have become ''a third level of government,'' building ''traditional and viable homelands for their people.'' ''American Indians, Time, and the Law'' is a scholarly book, but it is also persuasive, readable and fascinating. Seldom have legal abstractions been so ably distilled as here.",1987-03-08T05:00:00+0000

He never had a long-running series. Some of his more successful competitors on prime time, in terms of ratings, were people like George Gobel, Stu Erwin, Morey Amsterdam and Tennessee Ernie Ford. Yet, while they have decidedly faded, Kovacs remains as fresh as ever in his old black-and-white formats. His influence on subsequent TV comedy is detectable in styles ranging from Johnny Carson, ''Laugh-In'' and ''Saturday Night Live'' to David Letterman, ''Monty Python'' and ''Max Headroom.'' He has been impersonated by Jeff Goldblum in a TV-movie biography, and he has been saluted in a special exhibition at New York's Museum of Broadcasting.

Mrs. Keane, for those of you who haven't had the pleasure, is an Irish writer who was born some time ago - the exact year is rumored to be 1904. She was born in County Kildare into what she has described as a ''rather serious Hunting and Fishing and Church-going family.'' Turning to writing in order, she says, to supplement her dress allowance, she for years used the pseudonym M. J. Farrell ''to hide my literary side from my sporting friends.''",1987-03-09T05:00:00+0000

The report said that Howard Teicher and Donald Fortier, then of the White House National Security Council staff, had asked the C.I.A. for the update to see whether there was some way military support of some kind could blunt Soviet influence in Iran, and suggested that the intelligence agency came closer than it should have to giving the N.S.C. operators the policy answers they were looking for.

us,Q&A,"Q.What are cuds and why do cows chew them? A.Cows and other ruminants like goats, deer, antelope and similar hoofed mammals have stomachs divided into four compartments, designed to handle large amounts of forage. Ruminants do not chew their food completely at first. Instead, they chew the food only enough to moisten it with saliva for swallowing. The swallowed food goes into the paunch and the reticulum, the first two sections of the stomach. There the food is mixed with several kinds of bacteria and protozoa that start the process of digestion. After the animal has satisfied its appetite, it regurgitates or coughs up balls of the partially digested food from the paunch and reticulum. These balls are the cuds, and ruminants chew them thoroughly, swallow them and cough up more of them. The balls are eventually passed on to the other two stomach compartments, the omasum and abomasum, where digestion is completed. Q.Why does wax form in the ear canal and should it be removed? A.Ear wax is a fatty lubricant secreted by specialized glands in the skin of the ear canal to prevent bacterial growth. Because of its slightly acidic content, the secretion kills the bacteria that tend to form in the ear cavity, according to Dr. Derald Brackmann of the American Academy of Otolaryngology. Dr. Brackmann said a person should never clean the ear with cotton swabs or other pointed objects because such action only pushes the wax deeper into the ear and could lead to hearing loss or perforation of the ear drum. ''In general, the rule of thumb is: Don't put anything smaller than your elbow in the ear,'' Dr. Brackmann said. The ear is normally self cleaning; the wax migrates to the outer surface where it can be removed with a tissue. Occasionally, however, ear wax can build up and block the ear canal. In such cases, a physician should be consulted.",1987-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Clemens, who had a 24-4 won-lost record last year and was the American League's Cy Young Award winner and Most Valuable Player, walked out of the Winter Haven, Fla., camp last Friday when the Red Sox rejected his demand for a $2.4 million, two-year contract. He turned down the club's proposal of $500,000 plus $350,000 in incentive bonus money for the 1987 season. The Red Sox then exercised their right to renew Clemens's contract, setting a salary of $400,000 while hoping to resume negotiations for an agreement. Clemens is not yet eligible for arbitration. Lou Gorman, general manager of the Red Sox, said he had not had any contact with Clemens or his agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, since the walkout. Clemens's whereabouts were unknown yesterday.

Middle Tennessee, 22-6, the Ohio Valley champion, did receive one of the 35 at-large invitations. Delany is the Ohio Valley commissioner. Delany, 39, said he followed committee procedures and left the room when Middle Tennessee State's case was deliberated. He said Crum was wrong if he believed Middle Tennessee was the last at-large team selected. ''The fact is, Louisville wasn't in competition with Middle Tennessee.''

According to the ad, applicants had to have ''experience as principal in European company.'' What a requirement!

Although wagers on the outcome of individual tournament games not involving U.N.L.V. are allowed, the bookies are prohibited from taking bets on any team to win the championship as long as the Rebels are in the tourney.

McLain, 23 years old, from Hempstead, L.I., told of his drug dependency and subsequent rehabilitation in a first-person story for the March 16 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. McLain wrote the story with Jeffrey Marx, a reporter with The Lexington Herald-Leader. ''I had played well on coke, I had played bad on it,'' McLain said. ''It didn't seem to matter. So I did about a quarter gram of blow before the national semifinal in the bathroom of room 135 of the Ramada Inn, about three miles from Rupp Arena. In the locker room I was all quiet and subdued. Everybody was saying, 'You all right? You all right?' I said, 'Yeah, I'm with it.' But in the meantime, I'd gotten it in my head that if we lost it didn't matter. I just wanted the season to be over.'' McLain scored 9 points and had 2 assists as Villanova defeated Memphis State, 52-45. The Wildcats then upset Georgetown, 66-64, to win the national title, with McLain getting 8 points and 2 assists. McLain began the article by recalling the team's subsequent visit to the White House: ''I was standing in the Rose Garden, wired on cocaine. . . . President Reagan was welcoming my teammates and me at the White House and giving his little speech about how inspirational our victory was. And the cocaine had me floating in my own private world.'' McLain said he was treated for drug abuse at the White Deer Treatment Center in Allenwood, Pa., last summer after he had been dismissed from his job as a broker trainee on Wall Street.

us,PUTTING A HIGH GLOSS ON NEW YORK STYLE,"''DEAR SIR,'' a young student in Tokyo wrote to the restaurant designer Sam Lopata recently. ''I'd like to come study from you in America. I'm very serious.'' Mr. Lopata's work appears regularly in Japanese design magazines, not to mention American ones. Both Mr. Lopata and his New York colleague, the architect Peter Marino, have (quite separately) become part of the New York design Zeitgeist. They are hot. Both have developed international followings and tend to generate coverage - Mr. Marino for his lush interiors and stellar clients (including the designers Yves Saint Laurent and Mario Valentino); Mr. Lopata for his sometimes whimsical, sometimes serious restaurant interiors. Mr. Lopata has designed nearly two dozen restaurants in the past 10 years, including Joanna, Cafe Seiyoken, Prunelle, La Gauloise, Cafe Marimba, Pig Heaven, Batons, Safari Grill and Lox Around the Clock, as well as ''face lifts'' for Lutece and Chez Pascal. Though their specialties and styles are quite different, the designers reflect New York style circa 1987: Mr. Marino creates opulent fantasy worlds for prestigious clients, and Mr. Lopata, restaurants - fantasy environments for the rest of us.

Since the 1960's, however, he has also been writing larger works for non-jazz performers that also reflect his own ideas about structure and musical space. This weekend offers a rare chance to hear that music - for soloists, augmented string quartets and chamber ensemble - in concerts tomorrow and Sunday. Both programs feature ''Time Design'' for amplified string quartet and Mr. Coleman's son, Denardo, on electronic drums. Tomorrow's program also includes ''Notes Talking'' for solo mandolin (Andy Statman) and ''The Sacred Mind of Johnny Dolphin'' for chamber ensemble; Sunday's program also features ''Trinity'' for solo violin (Malcolm Goldstein) and ''For NASA and Planetary Soloists,'' played by the Kronos String Quartet with Joseph Celli on oboe.

The cornetist Jimmy McPartland, who frequently played with Mr. Freeman in Chicago in the 1920's, will celebrate his 80th birthday on Sunday by having a reunion with him, and will perform with Warren Vache Sr.'s Syncopatin' Eight, one of six bands that will play at the Stomp. The bands will include John Bucher's Speakeasy Jazz Babies, which plays every Monday with Woody Allen at Michael's Pub, and the Rutgers Jazz Band, which will have the pianist Mulgrew Miller as a guest.

Page 1 A church-state conflict in Chile was made less intense when the Roman Catholic hierarchy backed away from a bishop's charge that the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet was ''marked by an immense immorality.'' 3 A novel chronicling Stalin's terror, ''Children of the Arbat,'' has been excerpted in a Soviet weekly magazine, drawing to the attention of Soviet readers one of the most painful periods in the country's history. 1 An election contest in South Africa has focused attention on Somerset West, about 25 miles from Cape Town, where the ruling party is being challenged by a defector in the whites-only election. 1 Britain's first toad tunnel opened under the lethal Henley roadway in Hambleden, just in time for the mating season. The miniature tunnel is designed to help shepherd toads across a busy road to the mating ponds. 1 A trial on the Chernobyl disaster will begin ''soon'' in Kiev, said aSoviet official who said he did not know how many people would be prosecuted over the events at the nuclear power plant. 6 Debate about damage to a ferry that capsized off Belgium a week ago is now focusing on whether the propellers of the Herald of Free Enterprise were harmed and if she hit the harbor wall off Zeebrugge. 3 Declassification of the ABM treaty negotiating record was urged by Senator Sam Nunn so the public could evaluate the Administration's assertion that the agreement would allow ''Star Wars'' testing. 2 Greece's satirical tradition persists in language that is sometimes vulgar and often lacerating that spoofs political leaders and policies. ''Greeks,'' said one comedian, ''can laugh at themselves.'' 4 Six VW executives were suspended in a management shake-up following disclosures of a major foreign exchange swindle, Volkswagen A.G. said. Currency dealers said the action affected virtually all of the company's foreign exchange trading department. 37 Paris vows fight against terrorism 5 Prague group honors founder 6 NATIONAL 7-9, 34, 54 The Washington Post did not libel the former president of the Mobil Oil Corporation, a Federal appeals court ruled. The court reversed a $2 million judgment against the newspaper. 1 Payments for conserving farmland are more popular among American farmers than expected. Under a new Government program, nearly 19.5 million acres of highly erodible land have been removed from crop production. 7 The end of an era in Houston is how many residents describe the recent loss of local control over two of the city's most powerful home-grown institutions, The Houston Chronicle and Texas Commerce Bancshares. 7 Stanford University has a prototype electronic device made out of a new class of superconducting materials, scientists reported, indicating progress in superconductivity may come sooner than expected. 7 Japan will study superconducting materials in a government-coordinated effort to find commercial applications, said Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry, which organized a successful push into microelectronics. 7 Transplanting brain tissue from aborted fetuses in an effort to aid people suffering from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease has won support from a panel of medical, ethical and legal experts. 54 Richard Secord sent an angry letter to a book publisher last week touching on some issues that have been raised in the Iran-contra affair. The retired general has refused to testify about his role in the affair. 8 Criticism of the pace of an inquiry into the Iran-contra affair has come from the leaders of the Senate committee investigating the case, who say they are impatient with the work of Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel. 8 The President has not backed away from his view that his Iran policy initiative had deteriorated into a trade of arms for hostages, the White House spokesman said, responding to the White House counsel's statement that Mr. Reagan still believed in his Iran policy. 8 Hope for Arab-U.S. relations was voiced by Senator Bob Dole in an overture to Arab-Americans in the United States. His statements appeared part of an effort to portray himself as a consensus politician. 9 Industrial production rose five-tenths of 1 percent in February, the fifth straight monthly increase, the Federal Reserve Board estimated. Many analysts said the rise, though less than expected, showed that the economy continued to grow. 37 Georgia Power Co. may proceed with full power operation of the Unit 1 reactor at the Vogtle Nuclear Power plant in east Georgia, following a Nuclear Regulatory Commission vote. 34 Teen-ager expelled for modeling 9 Public hospitals ask help with poor 28 REGIONAL 29-32 John Gotti was acquitted, as were his six co-defendants, of Federal racketeering and conspiracy charges in the Government's first major setback in its recent assault on organized crime. 1 A weakness in the prosecution's case was its reliance on turncoat career criminals as key witnesses against Mr. Gotti and 6 co-defendants, many lawyers and prosecutors who followed the seven-month trial said. 1 Mr. Gotti is said to be ruthless, according to prosecutors, who believe he is the boss of the Gambino family, the power behind an empire of loan-sharking, extortion, hijacking, robbery and murder. 32 A Farmingdale, L.I., plant will close by the end of the year as a result of the Air Force and Fairchild Industries' announcement that their contract for the T-46A training plane has been canceled. More than 2,500 jobs will be eliminated. 1 Lawyers in the Howard Beach case say they will make an issue at trial of the finding that the victim had cocaine in his system when he was killed.

us,"By Paul Scott. Edited by Shelley C. Reece. 226 pp. New York: William Morrow & Company. $15.95.  AFTER THE RAJ  British Novels of India Since 1947. By David Rubin. 197 pp. Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England. $19.95.    THE main outlines of Paul Scott's literary life are clear but much about the man and his achievement remains shadowy. Born in London in 1920 and educated at Winchmore Hill Collegiate School, Scott served in the army in India during the Second World War and then until 1960 worked in publishing and as director of the David Higham Agency, literary agents, writing plays and half a dozen novels after hours. Success came gradually between 1966 and 1975, as each of the volumes that would become the panoramic ''Raj Quartet'' appeared. A related novel, the splendid ''Staying On,'' won the prestigious Booker Prize in 1977. Scott died a year later, achieving extraordinary fame posthumously when millions of people watched ''The Raj Quartet'' on television during 1984-85 as ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' the first title in the series, and have bought the ''Raj'' novels ever since.   As yet though, there is no biography and only a handful of critical studies, the most useful of which have been those by Patrick Swinden, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester. In this context, readers might well look to the 11 essays in ''On Writing and the Novel'' to learn more about Scott as a man and writer. But, with the notable exception of a fine piece called ''Method: The Mystery and the Mechanics'' and a subtle reflection on Britain and India after E. M. Forster, they are likely to be disappointed.   Scott was a reluctant essayist and nearly all the selections printed here were given as invitational talks at literary luncheons, summer school writers' conferences and dozens of stops on government-sponsored speaking tours of India. More often than not, his tone for the occasion is a kind of genial ''we're all in this together and good luck to us.'' Gentle jests about food and the weather mix with agreeable but platitudinous comments on the craft of fiction: ''Writing is a discovery . . . a vitamin, not a drug''; ''Imagination is not enough. Knowledge is necessary. And an experience of the oddity of life''; ''Literature must always be alive - to the past, to the present, to the opportunities of the future''; authors, rather like Tennessee Williams's ''poor Blanche Dubois,'' ''depend a great deal for well-being and peace of mind on the unconscious courtesy of strangers.''   About fiction in general and about other people's work, Scott is almost never illuminating; the same favorite quotations from Hazlitt, James or Lionel Trilling appear frequently with no glosses, and jovial anecdotes about Tolstoy and Turgenev, Shaw and Conrad stand in for analysis. Yet happily, Scott's concrete observations about his own work are always absorbing and revelatory. Every admirer of ''The Raj Quartet'' will treasure his explanation of how from glimpses of a girl in Calcutta, from reading about a criminal assault in Amritsar and the 1919 riots in the Punjab and from a long process of culling and reflecting, he ''discovered'' Daphne Manners and wrote the unforgettable description of the running girl that opens ''The Jewel in the Crown.''   Scott (in the essay on ''The Mystery and the Mechanics'') formulates his esthetic of the novel as a kind of dramatic poem built on expanding images and multiple points of view, and at the same time reveals one of his cardinal principles of characterization: that individual human action is often subject to the processes of an ienflamed collective conscience. Unlike so many of his bland observations about other writers and fiction in general, Scott's description of his own procedures has a contagious excitement and an interest that comes of a justified pride in obliged creation.   ''The image of the girl running didn't peter out -the veins of possible exploration became intensely complex. When you feel this happening you are at the heart of your mystery. Extracting the ore is the mechanical side of the operation, and to extract it you stand away from the image and subject it to a kind of bombardment, as if you're trying to split an atom. You bombard it with your knowledge, your experience, and your imagination, your creative impulse. If you're lucky you have a beautiful explosion.''   Something of the same purposive tension comes across in Scott's essay ''After Marabar: Britain and India, a Post-Fosterian View.'' Here the source of energy comes from his having been challenged by two vital and pointed questions about his work. ''Why,'' an Englishwoman asked, ''does he have to revive all that old bitterness?'' ''Tell me,'' queried an Indian, ''what you think you have to offer the world today that might be of value?'' The two blunt questions seemed inevitably to lead to a third: Didn't Forster in ''A Passage to India'' cover the subject satisfactorily enough?   Scott's answer comes out not in serial and conclusive form but as a textured meditation on some of the issues pertaining to all the questions. By reviving the old bitterness he hopes to combat present ignorance and prejudice and to forge a new understanding. But modesty requires him to admit that perhaps the most valuable thing he has to offer is the uncertainty of having anything of value to offer at all. In Scott's view, this mix of skepticism and idealism can best be expressed in that most valuable of dialectical forms, the novel. Fiction is a moral dialogue between writer and reader that invites not acquiescence but a ''creative and critical response to the life it depicts.'' Forster created such a dialogue, and so - Scott hopes - did he. In his opinion, however, ''The Raj Quartet'' is hardly a grand philosophical and prophetic set of novels, but rather a kind of elegiac saga that tries to capture ''the melancholy arising from too long an exile, from too far a removal from the source of dynamic native experience.''   For these views, and many others, Scott is the hero of David Rubin's study, ''After the Raj: British Novels of India Since 1947.'' Mr. Rubin, a novelist and visiting professor of modern Indian languages at Columbia University, begins with a brief survey of British fiction set in India before independence and skillfully identifies its dominant modes and myths. Then, following a chapter on Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, he turns to Scott, who in his judgment produced by far the best novels about the relations between the British and the Indians ''not only since Independence but since the very beginning of such fiction.''   Mr. Rubin's case for Scott's predominance in the tradition rests on a sure-footed, informative account of the narrative thrust, varied characterization and thematic coherence of ''The Raj Quartet.'' In Mr. Rubin's view, Scott's immense spectacle of the last years of the British in India is unified by the dramatic and complex working out of a metaphor that joins and illuminates public and private history.   What Scott has done is to make sexual excess, deviation and aberration a near-inevitable correlative of the imperial process; the greed, and the moral and ethical blindness that inspire and sustain colonialism in the sphere of public action are accompanied by a parallel degeneration in the private sphere, where sexual problems, violence and confusion reveal and symbolize the same moral failure. MR. RUBIN'S account of ''The Raj Quartet'' is often eloquent and insightful, but in his eagerness to support the case for Scott's supremacy, he continually finds it necessary to make claims for the importance of the four novels that are likely to strike many readers as strained to the point of implausibility. Because of the prominence of ''A Passage to India'' in the history of his subject, Mr. Rubin keeps whittling away at Forster's stature. While admitting his genius for physical and emotional evocation and for caricature, he finds his perceptions of India and the Indians only narrow and stereotypical, and too easily dismisses Forster's expansive mysteries as mere mystifications. Mr. Rubin (unlike Scott) resists the imaginative sweep of Forster's vision in which mysticism and comedy are inseparable; and he has virtually nothing to say about the brilliant originality and suppleness of Forster's style.   Then, too, in order to elevate Scott as both a chronicler of modern history and a psychological realist, Mr. Rubin unconvincingly compares him with Tolstoy and Proust. But the more persuasive comparison - mutatis mutandis - would be with Trollope, whose Barchester and Palliser novels offer some of the same pleasures of vivid storytelling, memorable characterization and shrewd social analysis that can make Scott's bleak panorama so engrossing. As Webster Schott once put it in these pages, ''The Raj Quartet'' is one of the longest, most successfully rendered works of 19th-century fiction written in the 20th century. Scott was probably pleased by that, and so should we be.",ON WRITING AND THE NOVEL,1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE PILTDOWN INQUEST. By Charles Blinderman. (Prometheus, $22.95.) After three-quarters of a century, the perpetrator of the greatest hoax in scientific history remains unidentified. Piltdown Man, represented by a human skull and apelike jaw found in an English gravel pit, stood tall in the halls of science as a missing link in human evolution for decades after the finds were announced in 1912. The fossils were not exposed as unequivocally fraudulent until 1953. Ever since, scientists have wondered how such crude fakery could have escaped detection, while countless sleuths have tried to finger the culprit who doctored and planted the bones. Was his motive a practical joke gone out of control, sweet revenge against gullible enemies, the impatient act of a theorist who believed such a fossil had to exist? Charles Blinderman, who teaches English and biology at Clark University, here conducts a witty, erudite investigation. He rounds up the usual suspects, a colorful lot that includes the theologian Teilhard de Chardin and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Mr. Blinderman has his own nominee as culprit but admits he could find no smoking bones. May the mystery live on, as well as the more frightening moral of the tale - not just to beware of hoaxes, but to remember how easily leading minds can fool themselves when a forgery tells them what they want to believe.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

In the mid-1970's her poetically condensed, visually syncopated triptychs of truck traffic and suburban houses caught the precise note of seriousness just when photography was itself beginning to attract attention in art precincts. In 1978 an exhibition of her dramatic still-life photographs of objects in her kitchen sink caused a sensation. When one appeared on the cover of Artforum magazine, it was a signal that photography had arrived in the art world -complete with a marketplace to support it.

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"THE INTELLECTUAL FOLLIES: A Memoir of the Literary Venture in New York and Paris, by Lionel Abel. (Norton, $7.95.) In 12 essays surveying American culture and politics across four decades, the author describes the conditions that drove the educated classes leftward in the prewar years and examines the effect of those conditions on artists. The pieces are ''replete with marvelous vignettes of major creative personalities,'' Vivien Raynor said in The Book Review in 1984. ''Mr. Abel was part of the New York scene at the time when American art was making its debut as an international force and his account of it is engrossing.'' HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE: The Making of the British Intelligence Community, by Christopher Andrew. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $8.95.) Christopher Andrew's narrative history of the British intelligence and security services, Michael Howard said here in 1986, ''illuminates a murky area with care, compassion, good humor and common sense.'' His portrait of this small, discreet and close-knit society assembles in a ''scholarly and lively . . . fashion all the information relevant to [ the ] profession and, without sparing well-deserved criticism, gives honor where honor is due.'' IRISH FOLKTALES, edited by Henry Glassie. (Pantheon, $11.95.) Most of these 125 tales were gathered from other authors or collectors, but some were tape-recorded from tellers in Ireland in the 1970's. In 1985 our reviewer, David H. Greene, praised the interesting introduction, which recounts how the collecting of folk tales began in Ireland in the early 19th century and intrigued the founders of the Irish literary revival. A FAMILY MADNESS, by Thomas Keneally. (Penguin, $6.95.) A young working-class Australian falls in love with the daughter of an obsessive Byelorussian immigrant - a madman whose own father was a Nazi collaborator. Thomas Keneally's novel, which moves between contemporary Sydney and the European past, achieves more documentary than literary success, our reviewer, Robert Towers, said in 1986. But the work is ''bold in its scope and its choice of subject,'' and its elements are assembled ''with an old pro's dexterity.'' THE PROTESTANT ESTABLISHMENT: Aristocracy & Caste in America, by E. Digby Baltzell. (Yale University, Paper, $12.95; Cloth, $35.) E. Digby Baltzell examines America's white Anglo-Saxon Protestant upper crust, and chronicles what he sees as the decline of the ''WASP'' establishment that for so long dominated the nation's politics and culture. The author discusses such phenomena as country clubs, patriotic societies, genealogy and anti-Semitism in ''a wide-ranging, intelligent and provocative book'' that is written ''lucidly, even stylishly,'' Alvin Toffler said in these pages in 1964. EVA'S MAN, by Gayl Jones. (Beacon, $7.95.) The story of Eva Medina, the narrator of Gayl Jones's novel, unfolds as she talks to a psychotherapist in the prison where she is being held for the killing and mutilation of her lover. This is a work of ''bedeviled compulsion,'' June Jordan said in The Book Review in 1976. ''Unerringly, [ the ] writing creates the tension of a problem unresolved.'' The same publisher has reissued the author's first novel, CORREGIDORA ($7.95), a portrait of a battered Kentucky blues singer. ''Gayl Jones has learned to write an interior monologue so naturally that it seems almost crude to say that she is using the stream-of-consciousness technique,'' Raymond Sokolov said here in 1975. ''The sexual writing,'' he said, ''is a model of grace and taste. And it is sexy. This is no mean achievement.'' POLITICAL MURDER: From Tyrannicide to Terrorism, by Franklin L. Ford. (Harvard University, $9.95.) The history of political murder - from antiquity to our own day - is treated here ''with encyclopedic scope,'' our reviewer, Eugen Weber, said in 1985. The author ''touches all major bases. . . . And his book is easy to read. If not used for reference, it may appeal as bedside reading for those who like a good murder.'' A BLUNT INSTRUMENT, by Georgette Heyer. (Berkley, $2.95.) A well-to-do English gentleman, Ernest Fletcher was easygoing and well liked - by everyone, presumably, but his murderer. In 1938 our reviewer, Kay Irvin, called this novel ''a brilliant mystery story, logical, well built, witty and original.'' The same publisher recently reissued two more Heyer mysteries (each $2.95). The victim in ENVIOUS CASCA is Nathaniel Herriard, a curmudgeonly bachelor who is dispatched at a Christmas party at his manor house. ''Rarely have we seen humor and mystery so perfectly blended,'' Isaac Anderson said here in 1941. The body in THEY FOUND HIM DEAD belongs to Silas Kane, whose departure during a walk in the fog seems to be part of a triple-murder plot. The author's mysteries may not have as many shudders as some others, ''but there is a lot more fun,'' Mr. Anderson said in 1937. HITLER AND THE FINAL SOLUTION, by Gerald Fleming. (University of California, $8.95.) Countering the arguments of some revisionist historians, Gerald Fleming sets out to demonstrate Hitler's personal responsibility for the extermination of the Jews. The author ''supplies the evidence that supports what reason suggests,'' Christoph M. Kimmich said in The Book Review in 1985. And he clearly shows ''Hitler's determination . . . to avoid a documented link to the policies he had initiated and sanctioned.'' ROOSEVELT TO REAGAN: A Reporter's Encounters With Nine Presidents, by Hedley Donovan. (Bessie/ Harper & Row, $8.95.) Most of Hedley Donovan's memoir is taken up with anecdotes and observations about the Presidents he has seen and met, but a large portion deals with his experience as an adviser to President Carter. His analysis of the Carter White House forms the heart of the book, Bernard Gwertzman said here in 1985, and is useful because ''he has no particular ax to grind and brings a veteran journalist's eye to the problems that infested the Carter Presidency.''",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

''Do you think they will be able to distinguish between the obfuscations, mystifications, efforts at humor, and plain statements of fact?'' That, of course, was the challenge, for it was in his letters that the poet's difficult and problematic character most vividly revealed itself. To be sure, there were other sources: interviews, memoirs, journals, autobiographical manuscripts. But it would have been hard to imagine his biography without the versions of himself he disseminated through the mail with such unflagging verve. ''These pieces of the self are with my friends,'' he noted in one of his verse-journals: ''They show me as I am, which never ends. / The word betrays the heart and mind.'' For Schwartz, letters belonged to the writer's vocation to which he had apprenticed himself; they were simply another mode of literary expression, like essays or poetry. But the sense of literature as a way of life has gone out of fashion, and so has the habit of writing letters. How many of us ever receive in the mail anything other than bills, magazines and the occasional perfunctory note? The telephone has made letters obsolete, and writers have not resisted its convenience. Even Robert Lowell, perhaps the Continued on page 25 last poet to know for certain that his life and work would merit a biography, was a less than assiduous correspondent; Ian Hamilton, his official biographer, relied as much on the recollections of friends as on the poet's letters.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,HILL STATIONS OF THE RAJ,"WHEN I THINK OF my childhood in north India, it is always summer: the days stretch endlessly, the sun is always at its zenith, turning the sky white with heat like a sheet of tin, the earth yellow and cracked with aridity. Dust storms sweep in from the desert, burying whole cities under a suffocating yellow pelt. In the garden, trees and grass shrivel and turn to straw. The electricity wavers and dies, the taps run dry. But then relief would come. On the 15th of May, schools closed for the summer and we packed our books and clothes into tin trunks, baskets and bedding rolls, the woolen garments feeling coarse and scratchy to the touch, travel fever rising in our throats till we felt sick, and then made our way through the greasy, stifling bazaars whose entire population seemed to be stretched out on the pavements for air, to the Victorian Gothic pile of red brick and yellow stucco that was, and is, the Old Delhi railway station. There we ran up and down the crowded platform, past porters, luggage trolleys, beggars and food stalls, searching for the carriage that had our name on the reservation slip pasted on the door. Then we climbed in to find four green leather bunks, a ladder for climbing into the upper ones, reading lamps and metal holders for glasses beside each, a metal washbasin that folded against the wall, three shutters - of wood, glass and wire gauze - at each window, to be pulled up and down, dim violet night lights and electric fans that buzzed like flies against the ceiling (before there was air-conditioning that brought with it not only cool air but protection from soot and grime so that clean bed linen, curtains and carpeting became possible). A bearer in a grimy white uniform and peaked red turban brought in dinner on tin trays - invariably chicken curry and rice followed by caramel custard (now that there are refrigerators in the dining car, this is replaced by cups of ice cream) - and took our orders for breakfast, which would invariably be very strong tea, buttered toast and omelets glistening with onions and green chilies. When he left, we prepared for bed, struggling and giggling in that confined space and wondering how some passengers managed to bathe in the closetlike bathrooms, sloshing ankle-deep in water. Finally we climbed into our bunks - not a moment too soon for our exhausted mother - certain we would not sleep for the pounding wheels and the shrill cries of vendors at passing stations - but sleep we did, hammered down into it by the rhythm of the steam train.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

After shooting a superb 8-under 63 on his home course yesterday in Orlando, Fla., Stewart held a lead of one shot over South Africa's David Frost, who shot a 65. Davis Cup Pecci Defeats Arias: Victor Pecci powered his way past Jimmy Arias in four sets to complete a suspended match and lift Paraguay into a 1-1 tie against the United States in the three-of-five-match Davis Cup World Group play at Asuncion, Paraguay. Pecci displayed a strong serve-and-volley game to overwhelm Arias, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, in three hours. The match was suspended at 3-3 in the third set at midnight Friday. The United States took a 1-0 lead earlier Friday night when the No. 1 singles player, Aaron Krickstein, topped Paraguay's Hugo Chapacu, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, in a match that took almost four hours.

Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg had the second-fastest time posted but he was disqualified for missing a gate. (AP) Austrian Wins Women's Downhill: Sigrid Wolf of Austria won a women's World Cup downhill for the second straight day at Vail, Colo., and that gave the season downhill title to Switzerland's Michela Figini. Wolf came out of the 16th start position to knock out the previous leader wearing bib No. 1. Friday, Wolf eclipsed the time of Pam Fletcher of the United States. Yesterday, she ran more than a full second faster than Laurie Graham of Canada. Wolf was clocked in 1 minute 52.30 seconds. Graham had a time of 1:53.47 and Switzerland's Maria Walliser was third in 1:53.66. When she finished third, Walliser lost the necessary points to catch Figini, who won three downhill races and finished the year with 93 points. Walliser had 90.(AP) Horse Racing Pine Tree Lane Takes Distaff: Pine Tree Lane, racing as part of a D.

Pine Tree Lane, a Kentucky-bred 5-year-old daughter of Apalachee, carried highweight of 125 pounds, conceding 8 to 17 pounds to her six rivals.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A LONG TIME DYING. By Olga Masters. (University of Queensland, 5 South Union Street, Lawrence, Mass. 01843, $17.95.) To hear and see rural Australia - as opposed to the urbanized version of the ''land down under'' peddled by Paul Hogan on American television - listen to the novelist Olga Masters in a chapter called ''A Spread of Warm Blood'' from her last novel, ''A Long Time Dying.'' Masters, who died late last year, both cherishes and laments the melancholy and impoverished existence of the struggling residents of an Australian country town in the 1930's. '' 'Sell up everything and go to the big smoke,' Frank said, very often at four o'clock in the morning with sheep bellowing in the pen at the back of the house, which was two miles from Cobargo on the Bermagui Road.'' The ''big smoke'' is Sydney, Frank is the local butcher and Cobargo the aboriginal name for the place. Among Masters' numerous characters are spindly legged, sunburned children, a young woman considered a spinster at 24 and the wayward son of the town's rich farmer - none of whom ever leave. Their prejudices, many still recognizable in Australia of the 1980's, abound. Members of the Pratt family, for example, who own a cafe, changed their name from the original Greek Pratenousis: ''Shortening their name saved them from total annihilation in Cobargo.'' The social realism of ''A Long Time Dying,'' whose chapters read like discrete short stories, can be a little relentless, but it is hard not to be moved by an episode in ''The Christmas Parcel'': the Churcher family is overwhelmed by the possibilities of a large package sent from the city and then excrutiatingly disappointed by its contents. Masters' soft touch is felt more than once in this novel.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE ST. VERONICA GIG STORIES. By Jack Pulaski. (Zephyr Press, 13 Robinson Street, Somerville, Mass. 02145, Cloth, $15.95; Paper, $8.95.) Jack Pulaski is at his best writing about what he seems to know best - the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Most of the stories in this impressive first collection follow the narrator as he wanders through bustling streets, schools and tenement brownstones inhabited by second-generation Russian-Jewish Americans and more recent Hispanic immigrants. Six stories trace the narrator's passage from childhood to young adulthood through a series of highly detailed impressionistic anecdotes whose effects are heightened by a subtle suggestion of the surreal. In ''The Merry-Go-Round'' and ''Religious Instruction'' Mr. Pulaski introduces us to the main character - his neighborhood - and if these stories seem slight at first they gain in resonance when seen as preludes to the narrator's development. In ''Minnie the Moocher's Hair,'' the collection's most powerful tale, we witness the disintegration first of a building superintendent's family and then the narrator's own. ''The Romance'' is about an older generation's memories of anti-Semitic pre-revolutionary Russia, while ''Music Story'' dramatizes the undercurrent of hatred that members of a contemporary teen-age Jewish band feel when they perform at a Roman Catholic high school. Two final stories juxtapose the dilemmas of different generations of the neighborhood's Hispanic immigrants. Mr. Pulaski has a gift for combining the lyrical with the earthy, but his lovingly detailed descriptions tend to overshadow the drama his stories contain.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE AUTOMATED BATTLEFIELD. By Frank Barnaby. (Free Press, $18.95.) It's the year 2010 and the Duchy of A invades the Sultanate of B with robot-driven tanks and remotely piloted aircraft. B responds with waves of autonomous, computerized missiles. A's invasion force is eventually destroyed, but not a single human life is lost. That's Frank Barnaby's vision of future warfare. ''There is no technological reason why warfare should not eventually become completely automated,'' he says. Mr. Barnaby, a former director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, isn't the first person to envision an automated battlefield. In 1969, Gen. William C. Westmoreland predicted it within 10 years. But soldiers are still slogging through swamps, and it can be argued that the General's reliance on high technology was premature in Indochina. Mr. Barnaby asserts that tactical nuclear weapons are ''militarily unusable'' because of the danger of escalation, and are unnecessary because conventional arms will soon ''approximate nuclear weapons in lethality.'' He calls instead for a ''non-provocative, non-nuclear defense'' with ''virtually no offensive capability.'' Mr. Barnaby writes clearly and doesn't try to overwhelm readers with barrages of acronyms. And he anticipates some of the fun that critics may poke at his idea of war between robots: ''Why not simply play a computer game?'' But in the end his vision of war without loss of life seems wishful thinking - no matter how comforting it might be to believe in it.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"WATCHERS. By Dean R. Koontz. (Putnam, $17.95.) ''We are watchers, all of us, watchers, guarding against the darkness,'' says Nora, a beautiful former recluse who, along with her husband (a handsome loner with a tragic past), has assumed a new identity in order to protect a remarkable stray dog. This golden retriever they call Einstein is the product of a top-secret genetic engineering experiment and the central character in this supernatural thriller by the author of ''Strangers'' and other books of this genre. The K.G.B. has just rubbed out all the scientists involved in the project, and Einstein is an escapee. The most richly drawn character in the book, he expresses his affection, wisdom and doggy sense of humor in extraordinary ways, communicating by manipulating Scrabble tiles and his own word processor. Nora, her husband and Einstein are being stalked by government agents, a maniacal hitman and The Outsider, a mutant killer from the same laboratory who is as Evil as Einstein is Good. This obsessed character is bent on destroying the dog in order to satisfy a bizarre sibling rivalry. He also has a penchant for decapitation and a compulsion to gouge out eyes. (He has a poor self-image and, literally, doesn't want anyone to see him.) Einstein, for all his brilliance, remains a basic dog, and he's pretty hard to resist. He's respectful where Saki's feline Tobermory was insouciant, and tasteful where Harlan Ellison's dog (''A Boy and His Dog'') - surely an inspiration - was vulgar. Despite some pedestrian writing, the suspense holds to the end. Displaying a little more depth and a lot more humor than Stephen King, Dean R. Koontz has really hit his stride.",1987-03-15T05:00:00+0000

The new campaign is more gradual and cautious than the de-Stalinization drive Nikita S. Khrushchev began in 1956. Page 1 Iran's threat to oil tankers in the Persian Gulf has increased since it installed large land-based anti-ship missiles near the Strait of Hormuz, U.S. sources say. 1 Marxist rule in Ethiopia is resented more widely even as it appears to be more firmly entrenched. Picking away at the country's edges are at least five guerrilla groups and two hostile neighbors - Sudan and Somalia. 14 A fight over U.S. aid to Pakistan may flare between the Reagan Administration and Congress because of the country's ongoing work on developing a nuclear bomb, Administration and Congressional sources said. 3 China's move to resist Western ideas and to reassert rigid Communist orthodoxy could last for decades, Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang said, adding that ''we are determined to oppose bourgeois liberalization.'' 3 The Pentagon is seeking permission to install nuclear warheads on a new missile that was originally intended to strengthen conventional forces in Europe and lessen the chance of nuclear war there. 8 Changing Mexico's ruling party is the goal of a newly organized group that calls itself the ''Democratic Current.'' It is led by the son of Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, one of the founders of the ruling party. 6 Rajiv Gandhi faces a new crisis. The Prime Minister's long-simmering dispute with India's President erupted in public this week, threatening to undercut his authority at a politically difficult time. 15 NATIONAL 21-29, 42-48 The President admitted error in not listening to two of his chief advisers, George P. Shultz and Caspar W. Weinberger, when they told him to stop selling arms to Iran. 1 Fiberglass may cause lung cancer and other diseases, evidence suggests, as may other synthetic mineral fibers. The evidence, though inconclusive, is creating a potentially far-reaching public health issue. 1 Southerners' political leanings follow national trends, according to an Atlanta Journal and Constitution poll that shows that Gary Hart and Vice President Bush lead in the South in the two Presidential nomination races. 28 It was open season on George Bush in New Hampshire this weekend, as the Republican contenders for President sniped at the front runner and competed for audience attention. 28 An international women's caucus is being held this weekend in San Francisco, where delegates from 42 countries are meeting to enlarge the political roles of women in democratic countries. 28 The dropout rate among Hispanic students is soaring. As they near the point of becoming America's largest minority, people of Hispanic descent are more likely by far to drop out of school than other ethnic groups.#22 Many can read, but not reason 22 Business jets stop in Salina, Kan., and in other small, uncrowded airports located in the nation's middle, for a break, a few hundred gallons of fuel, a toilet and a ham sandwich, not necessarily in that order. 22 Testing transportation workers at random for drug and alcohol use is the goal of proposed legislation, but the bill appears headed for a prolonged fight on the Senate floor. 23 Boston wants water transit by 1988. City planners hope that by next year the city's inner harbor will have the second most extensive system of water transportation routes in the nation, after Seattle. 43 A utility company has paid $50,000 to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for illegally dismissing a worker who was exposed to radioactive gas. The Philadelphia Electric Company feared the worker would notify the N.R.C. of the incident. 24 REGIONAL 30-39, 50-52 A Soviet freighter was stricken 210 miles off the New Jersey coast. In a howling Atlantic gale, Coast Guard helicopters plucked 37 Russians, including three women and an infant, from the deck and flew them to Atlantic City. 1 Foster-care children face chaos and a social-service system that is increasingly overwhelmed and ill-equipped to deal with them, according to officials, caseworkers and other experts. 1 A new indictment against John Gotti is being developed by Federal prosecutors based largely on secret tape recordings of Mr. Gotti discussing the economic spoils he would get as head of the Gambino crime family, law-enforcement officials say. 1 Teachers are winning raises as local and state governments move to improve the quality of public education, experts say. This year the average salary increase for the nation's teachers will far exceed the rate of inflation. 1 Relatives and friends gathered at funeral services to mourn the four teen-agers who died in a suicide pact.

Based on a true story, which was told in a book of the same title by Jim and Sybil Stockdale, Carol Schreder's teleplay offers a Vietnam War hero whose credo is apparently ''my country right or wrong,'' and his wife who, in her eight-year campaign to save her prisoner-of-war husband, finds herself affiliated with such pacifist groups as Women's Strike for Peace. There is, in short, a little something here for every political persuasion and, carefully avoiding complicated specifics, that's clearly what this waffling treatment wants. Shot down and captured in 1965, Navy Comdr. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking American officer imprisoned in North Vietnam. Although tortured and interrogated almost daily, he was able to organize a system of communicating with his fellow prisoners, a system that raised morale and kept the prisoners of war from cooperating to any great extent with their captors. Isolated and physically abused, Commander Stockdale is the epitome of the brave military man, always recalling his father's advice as he entered Annapolis: ''Do your best to be the best midshipman here.''",1987-03-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.How do scientists calculate the number of calories in a particular food and the number of calories the body burns in a particular exercise? A.A calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. To calculate the number of calories in a certain food, scientists burn the food in a device called a bomb-calorimeter, according to Jean Himms-Hagen, chairwoman of the biochemistry department at the University of Ottawa, Ontario. The device uses an electric charge to cause the food to combust, measures the amount of heat produced by the food and expresses that heat in terms of calories. Dr. Himms-Hagen said that the body burns food and gives off heat in a similar fashion. To measure the number of calories consumed during exercise, scientists have built very large calorimeters in which people can live. One type measures the heat given off by the person exercising. Another, called an indirect calorimeter, measures the oxygen that is consumed. Oxygen is needed for a substance to burn. Dr. Himms-Hagen said that an average man who is not very active burns 2,800 calories a day. He can increase the number by about 10 percent by playing squash twice a week and by 15 percent by jogging two hours a week. Q.Why does it take seven human years to equal one dog year? A.Dogs mature about seven times as fast as humans, according to Dr. Lawrence Glickman, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The equivalence is based on the amount of time it takes both species to undergo certain physiological changes, such as sprouting teeth and reaching sexual maturity. A dog develops much more rapidly in early life and then slows down: the first year for a dog is equal to 15 years for a human, but a 5-year-old dog is comparable to a 35-year-old human.",1987-03-17T05:00:00+0000

The news conference was held to announce the findings of a two-day review of Palmer's relationship with Norby Walters, an agent. Palmer, runner-up to Vinny Testaverde in the Heisman Trophy balloting last season, acknowledged he signed a contract with Walters on Jan. 2 and had since been given some cash advances pending an agreement with a National Football League team after next month's draft of college players. Charles Theokas, the athletic director at Temple who oversaw the review, said he had spoken to both Palmer and the Temple coach, Bruce Arians. ''I felt comfortable after talking with Paul and Bruce, who gave me 105 percent cooperation, that nothing was done improper,'' said Theokas. ''There were no violations whatsoever.'' According to a report in The Atlanta Constitution last week, Walters admitted giving cash to some players in violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. The story said Palmer was among the players whom attorneys and agents identified as having had past or present dealings with Walters. Theokas said part of his investigation included contacting Walters, who heads a New York firm that represents many sports figures, ''and he told me that he never stated Paul Palmer was given any money while playing for the Temple football team.'' Palmer said he intended to honor his contract with Walters and told reporters, ''I feel comfortable with him.''",1987-03-19T05:00:00+0000

With these new canvases, which are on view through March 28, Mr. Marden has moved beyond the work for which he is best known: the monochrome panel paintings that reduced painting to an austere yet voluptuous essence. Like the young Frank Stella of the ''Black Paintings,'' Mr. Marden started his career in a corner, making works so minimal they seemed to signal the end of painting.

He also points out that euthanasia is performed on most strays in shelters, and that they die a ''purposeless death.'' It is not that simple. Although the initial cost of pound animals is low, their use is not economical, except perhaps for nonsurvival surgery. Because of their unknown genetic and medical backgrounds, the use of pound animals can yield misleading results, paid for not only in the unnecessary suffering of the animals used, but also in the wasted time and salaries of the investigators, and in all the other costs of conducting research, and sometimes even in delays in scientific progress.

us,"2 PIANISTS A CELLIST, ORGANIST AND OBOIST","Louis Lortie Louis Lortie's impressive recital at the 92d Street Y Wednesday night introduced New York to a Canadian pianist with musical and technical gifts out of the ordinary. Mr. Lortie's program also had a certain honesty - discarding the usual historical survey of styles and concentrating on the bravura extravagance that suits his talents so well. The three Liszt ''Etudes de Concert'' that began the evening were not simply technically at ease; they had the kind of tone that emanates from an attentive and discriminating ear. The use of rubato, moreover, was never capricious or for effect alone, but always fit the curves of harmonic tensions developing beneath melodic lines. Liszt's extravagance must always be believable to the heart, and Mr. Lortie made us believe. He also played two of Chopin's familiar Scherzos and then gave over the second half of his program to Ravel - with ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' and the composer's piano version of ''La Valse.'' ''Ondine'' enjoyed its customary shimmer, but ''Le Gibet'' was even more communicative. Mr. Lortie's tempo was quite slow but the quiet control and subtle chiaroscuro created an arresting bleakness. Seldom will one hear the cold horror of this curious piece so well evoked. The ''Scarbo'' movement, of course, offers a different set of horrors -Ravel's conscious efforts to create piano music that outstrips even Balakirev's ''Islamey'' in difficulty. One could only admire Mr. Lortie's conquest of this fearsome material, but the stretches of hardness and angularity seemed to slip away from ''Scarbo'' as musical character piece and into ''Scarbo'' the pianistic obstacle. Mr. Lortie's best playing came in ''La Valse,'' never for an instant sacrificing beauty of timbre and inviting inner detail for right notes. It is perhaps beside the point to wonder how well this young man might meet the very different challenges of a Beethoven or a Schubert. What he accomplished on Wednesday should, for the moment, be satisfaction enough. The Gagnepains A brother and sister duo from France also gave pleasure at their Town Hall debut on Monday night. They were Xavier and Martine Gagnepain, playing the cello and piano respectively. The Brahms E-minor Sonata, in particular, struck that excellent balance between graceful coherence and the darker emotional needs of this music. Indeed, throughout this evening, one felt a musicianship that ceded to the ardor of the moment but always with eyes wide open. Such an approach, of course, suited the great Debussy Sonata admirably, and in Falla's ''Suite Populaire Espagnol,'' each section became a finely drawn, vividly acted vignette. Mr. Gagnepain offered a transcription of his own from Schubert's Introduction and Variations on an Original Theme. Its premise was correct - that Schubert's original flute is not a satisfactory medium. The music's florid detail, however, sat awkwardly for the cello as did its range, which rarely descended below the instrument's upper registers. The communication and coherence between these two players was witness to their lifetime musical association, though one wished at times for a little more aggressiveness from Miss Gagnepain, who too often chose the role of accompanist in music that demands full partnership. Mark Hill Mark Hill, an oboist with the chamber group Sylvan Winds, joined a small group of string players in various combinations for an evening of music at Weill Recital Hall. Tom Flaherty's Scherzo for oboe and three strings and the Arnold Bax Quintet gave an Irish touch to this St. Patrick's Day event, though the first, with it busy post-Hindemith contrapuntal style, had little of the Gaelic in it. The other, newer piece was an Adagio in E flat by Tison Street, which in its ascending major scale at the beginning announced a nostalgic harmonic idiom from a previous age. The Adagio owes much to the spirit of ''Verklarte Nacht,'' but I think even young Schoenberg at the turn of the 20th century would have found it reactionary. Mr. Hill played with a forthright competence, though one heard little arresting in matters of sharp rhythmic profile or distinctive phrasing. He would seem to belong exactly in the position toward which his career seems to be taking him -as an honorable contributor to chamber-music life. Alex Mendez Alex Mendez's organ recital at St. John the Evangelist Church last Sunday seemed a little less sure. In a program that ran from Bach to Alain, Mr. Mendez showed a penchant for bright registrations, but also a tendency to accelerate tempos past the point where either he or the music could manage them effectively. The result was a feeling of marginal competence often threatened by stress. Mr. Mendez also played his own Fantasia and Fugue in E minor, which merged the syntax of early Romanticism with a format from the Baroque.",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"The lavish pictorial display in Mary C. Henderson's THEATER IN AMERICA: 200 Years of Plays, Players, and Productions (foreword by Joseph Papp; Abrams, $45) should not deter one from reading the text, for this is both a book for browsers and a valuable and relatively concise history. Ms. Henderson, formerly the curator of the Theater Collection at the Museum of the City of New York, has the curiosity of a bibliophile as well as the enthusiasm of someone who loves the stage. Her book is divided according to profession, with chapters on producers, playwrights, actors and so on. Each story is told chronologically, which means there is a certain amount of repetition. At the same time, each chapter is independent and useful for reference. Enter anywhere and one is immediately immersed in tales about prominent theatrical personalities, from the Booth brothers (Edwin, Junius Brutus Jr. and John Wilkes) to R. H. Burnside, who cast elephants as well as actors in his spectacles at the Hippodrome Theater. The book is as up to date as La Mama and Mabou Mines and it is adorned with visual curios, including a colorful page of cameo portraits -cards depicting old theaters - that the tobacco company P.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE PATHOLOGY OF POWER. By Norman Cousins. (Norton, $15.95.) According to Norman Cousins, the world is mad. ''The Pathology of Power'' traces the etiology of its illness, from Hiroshima, where the decision to drop what Harry Truman called ''the terrible bomb'' had, Mr. Cousins shows, more to do with keeping the Russians out of the Far East than with defeating the enemy there, to General Dynamics, whose manipulation of ''the Revolving Door strategy, the 'perks and good fellowship' gambit, and the Blackmail ploy'' brought the company immense profits and the country lousy weapons systems. With nation-states threatening rather than protecting their citizens through their ''false reliance on unworkable power'' - that is, on nuclear force - Mr. Cousins, the author of ''Anatomy of an Illness'' and numerous other books, asks the question: Is it ''within the reach of the present generation of Americans to create global sanity''? His answer: Perhaps not, but it is our duty to try. Drawing on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's call for an ''integrated world society'' and Dwight Eisenhower's insistence on an ''alert and knowledgeable citizenry,'' Mr. Cousins, who knew both generals in their time, honors Congressmen, whistleblowers and muckrakers of our day who ''dare to speak truth to power,'' and ''everyone who has taken pains to communicate with public officials urging better policies than are routinely offered.''

Frankenstein's monster must have had quite a brain; he was reading ''Paradise Lost'' within a year or so after he was assembled. But nowhere in the novel did Mary Shelley discuss the monster's brain or anyone else's. The business of putting the wrong brain into the monster's head began over a hundred years later, with James Whale's classic 1931 film. ALAN C. ELMS Davis, Calif.",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

I caught glimpses of that ethnic past in the twinkle - the almost break-loose and ''signifying'' laughter - of his eyes when he told us of his dissertation. The title of that work in progress, according to him, was: ''Some Ontological and Eschatological Aspects of the Petrarchan Conceit.'' He never dreamed of writing such a work, but he enjoyed using philosophical words that he knew would send the curious among us scurrying to the dictionary. I believe he actually wrote on the ''Canterbury Tales.'' He intrigued us. Slowly puffing on the obligatory pipe, he would chide us for the routineness of our analyses of revered works in the British and American literary canons.

us,SHIFTING PROPORTIONS,"INFLUENTIAL DESIGNERS CREATE new fashion by how they cut a corner, shape a shoulder, lift a hem or drop a waistline. Sometimes, an extra nudge can start a trend. Recently, designers and manufacturers in Paris, Milan and New York have favored short hems, which is to say somewhere above the knee - the conservative at the top, the daring an inch or two above that. But at the Paris couture collections in January, Yves Saint Laurent went even higher. Daytime suits, jersey dresses, evening gowns - all had hemlines that stopped three or more inches atop the knee. Suddenly, in his wake, anything longer seemed demode. The full effect of Saint Laurent's shortened silhouette will be seen in all price ranges next fall. Similarly, a season ago, another couturier, Christian Lacroix, revived the empire waist in some evening designs. Now, there is a renewed interest in this lifted line. And after seasons of trying to squeeze clothes ever closer to the body, more loosely fitting fashions are slowly seeping back. Today, the only proportion that seems constant is broad, usually padded, shoulders. But these, too, may begin to ebb, or at least soften, come next autumn.",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

Coming to the Afrikaner's rescue, William Minter says ''segregation was a cooperative venture'' of Boer and Briton. In this history, which attempts to influence current Western policy toward South Africa, the author, a contributing editor of Africa News Service, shows how the imperial pursuit of wealth subjugated the African long before the Afrikaners in South Africa formally instituted the racially discriminatory apartheid system. Britain's quest for minerals led to the exploitation of black labor and the subordination of the entire subcontinent. From the early 1900's, English-speaking South Africans, often portrayed as reformist liberals, helped build apartheid, acquiesced in the Afrikaner National Party's cruder versions and benefited as disproportionate owners of the country's economic assets. Breadth is this book's virtue: the progress from colonization to independence in Zaire, Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and elsewhere is traced in tandem with the ongoing liberation struggles in Namibia and South Africa. Mr. Minter's statistics amply document the inequity of colonial development in each of these countries. But his argument that the West, historically implicated in the development of apartheid, can now force an end to it, is seriously handicapped because he does not probe the Afrikaners' resistance to foreign pressure or their continued dominance of politics in South Africa.",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

For readers not versed in the ways of trout fishing, a Parmacheene Belle is one of the most fetching of flies, able to draw the biggest fish, but one that ''wears out so fast we got to make use of it sparingly.'' Elusive title aside, this is a remarkably inventive first novel, narrated in the first-person voice of a curmudgeonly old angler whose wife of 53 years, his own Parmacheene Belle, has just died. Their idiot son and the wife's cousin are now the extent of his family; dizzy with anger and disbelief at his loss, the widower hurls a kitchen chair at the two. Terrified at the possible consequences of his action, he runs off into the forest, where he serendipitously meets up with a 15-year-old cosmetic-toting, pot-smoking amateur prostitute runaway. Together this ''expert pair of renegades'' embark on an adventure of mythic proportions as they make their way from the mountains, which the wife (she is not referred to by name) saw as ''nought but impediments,'' toward the ocean, which she lived by as a girl. Along the way, the reader is introduced to the underground world of a nameless Eastern city, and is invited to share the old angler's process of self-discovery. ''I tell you after fifty-three years you do gain an intimacy with the woman. She shares your name and you grow used to her presence on the mattress. But if the wife wants to proceed to the grave, if she wants to leave you to fend for yourself, then you must call an end to the union, you must prepare yourself for a long separation.'' Rage alternates with the reflective stance of a man entering the final stage of his life in this moving, wise novel.",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

Although he acknowledges the individual industrial ties of Whitehead staff - a not insignificant qualifier in this era of academic entrepreneurship - Mr. Novick argues that the institute itself is above corporate collusion in its devotion to basic research and that the intense debate at M.I.T. over its establishment ''had nothing to do with present or future industrial connections.''",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

Nothing could be further from the truth, for one of the fundamental points of Darwin's book is that males and females are inexorably linked in their evolution, and that differences between the sexes must be viewed as responses to selection pressures that we may not yet understand. The phrase seems taken from the discussion on secondary sexual characters (page 557 in the one-volume second edition of 1875): ''Male and female children resemble each other closely, like the young of so many other animals where the adult sexes differ widely; they likewise resemble the mature female much more than the mature male. The female, however, ultimately assumes certain distinctive characteristics, and in the formation of her skull, is said to be intermediate between the child and the man'' (my italics).",1987-03-22T05:00:00+0000

The 6-foot-8-inch Daniels received cash, clothing, a car, a motorcycle and free housing from U.N.L.V. coaches, boosters and other representatives of the school, Newsday reported in its Sunday issue. Coach Jerry Tarkanian denied the charges Sunday night, shortly after the Rebels had defeated Iowa to earn a berth in the Final Four. ''It's just not true,'' Tarkanian said. ''We would never do anything like that - no way.'' The newspaper based its charges on several interviews and official documents. It said Daniels declined to be interviewed. The school's athletic director, Brad Rothermel, said last week he knew of no irregularities in his school's dealing with Daniels. Regarding the charges, Rothermel said he would ''guarantee we didn't do one thing.'' After dropping out of Andrew Jackson High School in Queens in February 1986, Daniels signed a letter of intent with Nevada-Las Vegas in April and spent the summer in Las Vegas before enrolling at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif., in the fall. Daniels, who never received a high school diploma, enrolled at Nevada-Las Vegas as a full-time student in January, planning to play there as a junior-college transfer starting next December. But Daniels's future as a college player was clouded after his arrest Feb. 9 on a charge of attempting to possess a controlled substance, crack.

us,Q&A,"Q.People usually cut off the brown spots on fruits such as bananas and apples because they don't look very pretty. Is there actually any harm in eating them? A.The bruised or overripe parts of fruits and vegetables probably contain some type of fungus, mold, or fermented material that could upset the digestive system, according to Dr. Gerald Dull of the Georgia Agricultural Research Service in Athens. Dr. Dull recommended that such spots be removed and if the spots are large that the area surrounding them be tasted before eating to make sure the fruit is not spoiled. ''Just use common sense, if it doesn't smell and taste good don't eat it,'' he said. There are some fruits that are exceptions, however. For example, when pineapples are stored for long periods of time they develop small brown spots within. These indigenous brown spots, as they are called, are esthetically unpleasant, but the pineapple is just as good as one without the spots, Dr. Dull said. Q.Is it true that sharks never sleep? A.Because sharks are very difficult to keep and observe in captivity, very little is known about their behavior. Scientists have little knowledge as to whether sharks engage in a sleeping activity similar to ours, according to Dr. Samuel Gruber, a biologist at the Rosen Steil Marine School at the University of Miami. Sharks do not lie down for long periods and respire deeply. Nor do they exhibit rapid eye movement. But some sharks such as the nurse shark appear to rest regularly on the sea bottom or in underwater caves. However, most sharks do not rest like that because they must continue to move about in order to run water over their gills for oxygen. To rest on the ocean floor would mean death, Dr. Gruber said. Still, the shark may be resting in its own way. Experiments have shown that a shark maintains swimming movements even when its spinal chord to its brain has been severed. The shark seems to go on automatic pilot.",1987-03-24T05:00:00+0000

He bloodied Tillis, 29, midway through the fifth round. When Tillis indicated he could not go on, John Coyle, the referee, stopped the bout after 1 minute 50 seconds. Tillis's record slipped to 35-11-1.(AP) Tennis Jarryd and Bloom Advance: Anders Jarryd of Sweden beat Libor Pimek of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-3, and Gilad Bloom of Israel defeated Christophe Geukens of Belgium, 6-3, 6-2, to reach the second round of the Belgian Indoor championships yesterday. The 25-year-old Jarryd dominated Pimek throughout the match that lasted less than 90 minutes. Bloom, playing in his first Grand Prix event outside his native country this year, had less trouble in disposing of Geukens, a local qualifier. The 20-year-old Israeli, in his second year as a professional, took less than an hour to win. In one of the bigger upsets so far, Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden beat Emilio Sanchez of Spain, the tournament's No. 4-seeded player, 6-1, 7-6.(AP) Shriver Upset: Marianne Werdel stunned second-seeded Pam Shriver, 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, in opening round of the $150,000 Virginia Slims of Washington tournament last night. Werdel, of Bakersfield, Calif., fought back from a 5-4 deficit in the final set, then won the tiebreaker, 7-3. Shriver, the fifth-ranked player in the world, could not contend with the power-hitting of Werdel, 19, who refused to fold when Shriver served for the match at 5-4 moments after breaking serve. After Shriver, of Lutherville, Md., easily won the second set, Werdel never quit banging the ball and rarely had a mishit. Earlier, Czechoslovakia's Hana Mandlikova, the top seed, advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 triumph over Gigi Fernandez. Mandlikova, ranked No. 4 in the world, trailed 0-2 and 15-40 at the outset of the match before winning 20 of the next 23 points to take control. (AP) N.B.A. Celtics 111, Cavaliers 88: Larry Bird scored 32 points and Kevin McHale had 22 last night as the Celtics rolled to their fourth consecutive victory, playing in Hartford. McHale had all his points and Bird had all except 2 of his in the first three quarters as the Celtics built a 20-point lead. It was the second straight loss and second straight low-scoring performance for the Central Division's last-place Cavaliers, who were coming off a season-low 76 points in a weekend loss to the Indiana Pacers. Bird made 13 of 16 shots and had 9 assists and 8 rebounds. Boston held Ron Harper, the high-scoring rookie who leads Cleveland with 23 points a game, to only 8 on 3-of-12 shooting. (AP) Hawks 96, Bullets 87: Dominique Wilkins took six stitches above the left eye in the first quarter but scored 31 points to lead Atlanta in Landover, Md. Kevin Willis had 22 points for the Hawks, who won their third straight to move a game ahead of the idle Pistons in the Central Division. Jeff Malone, the Bullets' guard who was averaging 22.3 points a game, missed his first 13 shots and finished with only 6 points. His only field goal came with five seconds remaining. (AP) N.H.L. Penguins 3, Flyers 3: Warren Young scored at 8:45 of the third period to give the Penguins the tie on their ice. Young put a rebound past Glenn Resch for his seventh goal of the season as the Penguins rallied from a 3-0 second-period deficit. Philadelphia is 0-0-8 in overtime, the only N.H.L. team that has not won or lost a game in overtime this year. (AP) Canadiens 4, Nordiques 3: Bobby Smith's goal with 26 seconds to play was the game-winner. The goaltender, Clint Malarchuk, stopped Claude Lemieux at the lip of the crease but the rebound rolled to Smith, who sent the puck into the net. The victory was Montreal's first at the Colisee in two years and gave the Canadiens a 5-3 won-lost record against Quebec this season.(AP) Maple Leafs 6, Sabres 5: Rick Vaive and Dan Daoust had a goal and an assist each as the Maple Leafs blunted a third-period rally. The Leafs entered the third period with a 5-2 lead, but the Sabres, at home, then outscored Toronto, 3-1. Peter Ihnacak scored Toronto's only goal in the third period, and it was the winner.(AP) Swimming Evans and Podkoscielny Win: Janet Evans, a 15-year-old from Placentia, Calif., and Mariusz Podkoscielny of Poland won the grueling 1,000-yard freestyle events yesterday on the opening day of the United States Swimming Short Course National Championships in Boca Raton, Fla. The two distance events were the only ones scheduled on the first day of the five-day competition at the Mission Bay Aquatics Center. Evans, who is only 5-foot-3-inch and weighs 90 pounds, is perhaps the smallest United States swimming champion ever. She covered the distance in 9:32.59 to easily beat Kim Brown of Irvine, Calif., who was second in 9:36.55. Debbie Babashoff of Mission Viejo, Calif., was third in 9:39.43. Podkoscielny finished in 8:54.93 to beat Alex Kostich of Bellmont, Mass., in the men's event. Kostich was timed in 8:56.18. (AP)",1987-03-25T05:00:00+0000

The Jazz Center's ''Celebrating Late Great Black Composers and Artists'' series is now in its fourth season and, after paying tribute to such superstars as Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Charles Mingus, it is now getting to some of those who are not often the subject of such acclaim. The pianist Wynton Kelly, who died in 1971 and had been a member of the Miles Davis and Wes Montgomery groups, is one who particularly deserves such treatment before his memory fades. For James Williams, Wynton Kelly was one of his prime influences. Mr. Williams's schooling as a pianist has included the Berklee College of Music and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, with whom he played for four years. Leading a trio, a quartet and a quintet, Mr. Williams will play such Wynton Kelly compositions as ''Sassy,'' ''Temperance'' and ''Action'' as well as pop standards that Kelly played.

The dissidents speak largely to Mr. Gorbachev and address what could be done. The emigres talk mostly to the West and focus on what should be. Consider these two different views: ''It's not right to say that it's only propaganda or window-dressing. Objectively, something real is happening. How far it's going to go is a complicated question. But I myself have decided that the situation has changed.'' ''For the West to take the new policies at face value is to deal with symptoms and ignore the disease. . . .

(Perennial Library/Harper & Row, Paper, $12.95.) As a national ritual dutifully observed by millions, the annual Academy Awards telecast ranks somewhere between New Year's Eve and ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'' As an exercise in self-congratulation, however, it is second to none. In ''Oscar Dearest,'' Peter H. Brown and Jim Pinkston can never quite decide whether the presentation is a three-hour movie trailer, a ''pagan rite'' or ''the world's largest Kiwanis Club luncheon gone stark raving mad with greed, covetousness, envy, and hate.'' No matter. Mr. Brown, the author of ''Kim Novak: Reluctant Goddess'' and ''Such Devoted Sisters: Those Fabulous Gabors,'' and Mr. Pinkston, who co-wrote the second volume of ''The Official Movie Trivia Quiz Book,'' recount the 60-year history of the Academy Awards in a combative tabloid style (''the press swallows the Oscar decisions as if they were handed down by Moses on stone tablets'') well suited to their interest in spectacular snubbings. These range from the failure by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honor Bette Davis (for ''Of Human Bondage'') and John Barrymore, through the blacklist of the 1950's to Sacheen Littlefeather's nonacceptance of Marlon Brando's Oscar for ''The Godfather'' (1972) and beyond. Why this interest in Oscars ungiven? Among other things, the Academy Awards is a party to which most of us are not invited, and a desire for vengeance is not lost on the authors. At one point they assure us that ''those almost unbearably ugly little statuettes are like Kewpie doll trolls which spring to life in the dark and lash out at those who possess them.'' It sounds like the premise for a Wes Craven film - he'll probably never win an Oscar either.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

In 1961, at the age of 25, Tony Kubek was the starting shortstop for the New York Yankees, arguably the best baseball team of all time. With Ralph Houk, its rookie manager, the team won 109 games, hitting an incredible 240 round-trippers, then soundly defeated the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. But 1961 is most memorable for the assault by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris on Babe Ruth's record 60 home runs. The country went wild. A stripper billed herself Mickey Maris. Fans checked daily box scores, noting the progress of the M and M boys more closely than they charted the Dow Jones. Sales of M & M candies soared. The pressure on both players was enormous, but it was Roger Maris who somehow earned the derision of the fans. On the last day of the season he did pop the record-breaking homer, but his hair fell out, he developed a rash and never again scaled the heights of that year. Mr. Kubek, who provides commentary for television's ''Game of the Week,'' and Terry Pluto, the co-editor of ''A Baseball Winter,'' help us remember that frenzied time. Peppered with anecdotes (like the time Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle put pine tar in Mr. Ford's deodorant - which Yogi Berra had the annoying habit of borrowing), this is an insider's view: lively, entertaining and, perhaps best of all, nostalgic.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

A mystery by the best-selling author and former steeplechase jockey Dick Francis promises certain ingredients: an intricately concocted plot, a raft of characters ranging from race track plungers and stable hands to royalty, and a good deal of the gritty ambiance of England's racecourses. ''Bolt'' delivers on each of these elements. As the story opens, Kit Fielding, a successful but beleaguered jockey, is struggling not only to keep his mounts in the winner's circle but also to ward off the hostile attention of Maynard Allardeck, a track steward whose family has feuded with the Fieldings for three centuries. In addition, Kit's fiancee, Danielle de Brescou, recently has begun turning her attention to a French prince who is staying at the de Brescou estate. Matters worsen when Princess Casilia de Brescou (the owner of most of Kit's mounts) is approached by Henri Nanterre, a business associate of her invalid husband. This overbearing and unscrupulous Frenchman is determined to force de Brescou to turn their mutually owned company into a manufacturer of plastic guns destined to be illegally shipped to the United States. After de Brescou refuses, Kit is called in to help them resist Nanterre's threats. Sporting the proverbial British stiff upper lip throughout, Kit draws on all of his considerable pluck and wit to win back his fiancee, prevent Allardeck from sabotaging his career and keep de Brescou from capitulating. The result is a novel that races along with all the alacrity of one of Kit's mounts at the Devon or Ascot racecourses. A subtle twist at the end makes the jaunt all the more enjoyable.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"TALKATIVE MAN. By R. K. Narayan. (Elisabeth Sifton/ Viking, $15.95.) ''If you are interested,'' the narrator of this tale set in the south Indian city of Malgudi tells a cosmopolitan visitor, ''I could give you a long list of things we don't have.'' But readers who have already traveled the deceptively quiet streets memorialized by the eminent Indian novelist R. K. Narayan will know that the list of attractions Malgudi offers is much, much longer. Among these are gentle intrigue, a warm and worldly-wise sensibility, a crowd of charmingly contentious characters and the kind of tragicomic storytelling that can make the exotic feel familiar. All these are deftly exhibited by the ''talkative man'' who narrates the story. He is a gossipy bachelor and wealthy amateur journalist whose insatiable curiosity lands him an unusual house guest: Dr. Rann - a blond, blue-eyed United Nations bureaucrat who not only is gradually exposed as a fake and a womanizer but who is as much an Indian as any of the dhoti-clad citizens of Malgudi who set themselves to spy on him. The revelation of Dr. Rann's true identity becomes a vehicle for exploring the ways in which the East and the West perceive (and misperceive) each other. The proclivities of foreign tourists are shrewdly noted by the amused locals, yet they allow themselves to be taken in by the imposter's baffling ''science,'' called ''futurology.'' And when Dr. Rann, an Indian who looks like a London banker, claims that he is actually ''from Timbuctoo'' - which he convincingly but fraudulently describes as a port on the coast of Africa - his host is inspired to write effusively in the newspapers about his realization ''that Timbuctoo is very real, as real as our Malgudi.'' This, of course, is the quintessential Narayan joke. And in ''Talkative Man'' he plays it as skillfully on himself as he does on the rest of us.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"WAKING FROM A FASCIST YOUTH An Italian Story. By Dan Vittorio Segre. 273 pp. Bethesda, Md.: Adler & Adler. $16.95.    ITALIAN Jewry, the most ancient of the Western Diaspora communities, remains still too little known outside of the peninsula itself. Of late, however, as the result of translations of works by several notable authors - among them Primo Levi, Giorgio Bassani and Natalia Ginzburg - readers in this country have been given a glimpse into some compelling moments in the recent lives of Italian Jews. With his own translation of his ''Memoirs of a Fortunate Jew,'' published in Italy in 1985, Dan Vittorio Segre opens up one of the more fascinating chapters in the history and culture of his countrymen, even as he chronicles the story of his departure from them.   Today a professor of Zionism and Jewish political thought at Haifa University in Israel, Mr. Segre was born the son of a wealthy Jewish landowner in the Piedmont. The time of his birth was auspicious, for it coincided with a constellation of national and political tendencies that, at first glance, strikes the reader as bizarre: ''I never entered into the Mussolini regime - I was born into it. As a totally assimilated Jew and as an Italian raised under a political regime of which my family and all my friends approved without any reservation I, too, saw Fascism as the only natural form of existence.'' As Mr. Segre recounts his story, it becomes clear that an idyllic Fascism was not, in fact, to be his lot any more than it was to be his country's, and at the age of 16, in 1939, he abandoned Mussolini's Italy for Palestine. How and why he came to make this move and what awaited him in its aftermath form the heart of his engaging narrative.   To understand his story, one needs to look back to the 19th century and to the place of the Jews in the political history of Italy. During the crucial decades of the Risorgimento, the Jews of Italy gave unreserved support to the policy of national unification. In Mr. Segre's words, they rightly saw themselves as ''the founding fathers of a new nation'' and typically ''felt more Italian than the Italians.'' Convinced that nationalism would bring an end to centuries of discrimination, they enthusiastically embraced the new movement. It would have been inconceivable to these ardent Jewish patriots that the country to which they had given so much of themselves and into which they had seemingly been received as equals would, only a short time later, chase them out of their own homes. That, though, is precisely what was to occur, for with the institution of the racial laws of 1938 the Jews found themselves suddenly disenfranchised. Their shock at this betrayal was profound. Looking back at events, Mr. Segre came to realize that, for all of his early illusions about having a ''normal and carefree'' life under Fascism, he had ''lived in the belly of the monster, totally unaware of its existence.''   Although he came from an anti-Zionist home, the young Mr. Segre embarked almost immediately for Palestine and for a way of life for which he was not in the least prepared. Many of his most vivid pages describe his feelings of uprootedness and estrangement in a country and a culture that were alien to him. Lacking solid connections to any ancestral Judaism or to the newer collectivist ideologies of Zionism, the author saw himself ''in exile in the motherland to which  [ he ]  had chosen to return.'' He joined a kibbutz, then left it for studies at an agricultural school. A short time later he joined the Palestine Regiment of the British Army and served for six years in an intelligence unit, much of the time in Jerusalem.   The world he came to know in these early, difficult years of resettlement was one ''of frenetic action, without reserves or counterweights, with no hiding places for the soul.'' Whatever else life may have been like in Palestine, it was anything but dull: ''From the setting of the sun until dawn, the entire Yishuv  [ the Jewish settlement ]  did nothing but argue.'' Mr. Segre's accounts of this clamorous life and of the people who composed it -British soldiers and colonial administrators, city Arabs and Bedouins, secular and religious Zionists, Jewish pietists and apostates - are richly drawn, as is his account of his own bewilderment as a young Italian romantic displaced into a human landscape roiling with intense competition of egos and ideologies of every sort. ''Nobody,'' he writes, ''and first and foremost myself, knew exactly who I was.''   To bring some clarity out of so much confusion is the challenge of every work of autobiographical reconstruction. Mr. Segre takes up the challenge by reaching back into his past in an effort to explore the many sides of a single, troubling question, one that awoke in him during the years of his youth in Fascist Italy and accompanied him to Palestine: is it possible to comprehend someone else's anguish, share someone else's sorrow and pain? DISTURBED by what he regards as his coldness or indifference to the sufferings of others, Mr. Segre engages in sustained reflection about the turbulent and sometimes tortured lives of his parents, his friends and lovers, his native and adopted lands.   Along the way, in tones alternately humorous and serious, he comes face to face with some wrenchingly difficult truths about himself, foremost among them his abiding sense of isolation and inner estrangement. The insights that he manages to gain as he recalls some of his more poignant encounters with family and country, religion and politics, sexuality and morality, self and other are of a high order and indicate a maturing grasp of the world's complexities. By the book's end, the author has succeeded in making sense out of what otherwise would appear to be so much contradictory experience, and he comes to learn, if only in rare moments of shared experience, that life ''is stronger than evil.'' Such knowledge, in a book that registers moments of profound alienation and pain, is no small achievement. That Mr. Segre has been able to accomplish so much in a story filled with significant historical as well as personal detail is everyone's gain.",MEMOIRS OF A FORTUNATE JEW,1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

William B. Stallcup, the interim S.M.U. president, told The Dallas Morning News that ''several of the university's communities'' had urged him to cancel the 1988 season, and for a couple of persuasive reasons. ''One is that we wouldn't have enough kids to play. We don't want to put anyone in a position of being hurt. Secondly, it would give the university more time to make the decision about its future.'' Asked whether S.M.U. would play in 1988, he replied: ''Right now, I can't think of any strong arguments in attempting to do so.''",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

To the question ''Why on earth would anyone want to live in the wilderness?'' John Haines provides a lyrical answer in this short book of essays about life in Alaska. His is not the ooh-and-ah prose of travel writing, or the macho rhythm of outdoor magazines or even the Linnaean detail of nature books. Rather, Mr. Haines, a poet-homesteader who worked and wrote for 15 years in the bush, sets his scenes and tells his stories from the point of view of someone who loves his demanding environment deeply but still is somewhat in awe of what it can do. He has the eye of an Audubon and the style of a Thoreau. He describes an encounter with a grizzly bear in terms that graphically communicate his barely controlled fear. In ''Death Is a Meadowlark,'' he finds the perfect carcass of a frozen bird, a ''tiny, quenched image of vitality.'' But, as if fearful that we will think him sentimental, he goes on to describe the killing and dressing-out of a moose, and in so doing gives us a peep into the ecological cycles of death and rebirth. His people are rawhide men, ''bent to the cordwood and the trap''; but, as Mr. Haines says of one of them, ''as long as he can walk or stand he will stay with this life of snow, of fur, of solitude and dogs.'' In Mr. Haines's wilderness, the seeker will find ''a freshness denied him in the place he came from.'' This wondrous land is lighted by a major talent telling his stories in a haunting minor key.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Well, don't be jealous, New York. You are developing your own legend: the ''Metropolitan gasp.'' The latest manifestation of the phenomenon - the sudden, communal drawing-in of breath, followed by fervent hand clapping - comes during Franco Zeffirelli's (sometimes known as Puccini's) ''Turandot.'' The Act II, Scene 2 curtain rises on a dazzlingly bright throne room so grandiosely proportioned that the poor old Emperor of China becomes a fly on a distant wall. Does it matter that the set is so deep that people in balcony and family circle seats complain that they cannot see the Emperor or, in fact, much of whatever it is that goads the main floor to stunned applause? Apparently not to those who control the destinies of the Metropolitan, where every new production evidently must now offer at least one show-stopping visual coup rivaling Broadway's ''Starlight Express.''

C., South Norwalk, Conn. Answer: The best way of flying to Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) is via one of the European gateways. Until last year, the quickest route was by South African Airways to Johannesburg, with a connection there for the relatively short flight to Harare, but the airline no longer flies from the United States because of the Government's sanctions against South Africa. The most popular gateway now is London, from which Air Zimbabwe has service to Harare on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and British Airways on Wednesday and Friday. Air Zimbabwe also has flights each week from Frankfurt to Harare. Some of the flights are nonstop; Nairobi is among stops on other flights. From London, the nonstop flight takes about 10 hours, from Frankfurt a little less. Fares vary according to route and current exchange rates, but a round-trip ticket from New York bought a month in advance will be around $1,900.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"WE ARE YOUR SONS: The Legacy of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. By Robert and Michael Meeropol. (University of Illinois, $27.50.) The ''we'' of the title are the sons of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were principals in a case that resulted in their 1953 execution but that to many people remains unresolved. It has been 12 years since the Meeropols wrote the first edition of this book, an uneven but compelling volume of their parents' prison letters and their own memories of loss, adoption and political coming of age. It has been 12 years, too, since they fastened on the Government's files as a possible source of exculpatory evidence. Now the Meeropols answer those who assert, again or anew, that their parents conspired to pass secrets of the atom bomb to the Russians; particularly galling, they say, is Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton's use of the same documents to conclude in their 1983 book, ''The Rosenberg File,'' that Julius Rosenberg was a spy. The first edition, though hardly agnostic, left the job of vindication to others; this one, with three new chapters, does not. While the corruptibility of the legal process warrants all the attention it can get, it is not possible from these chapters to judge the evidence available at the trial in 1951 or even now.

The editors operate on the premise that a formidable Jewish theology is developing that encompasses more than most 19th-century historians of Jewish religious thought conceived as possible. Jewish ''theology,'' for most historians of Jewish religious thought, was essentially a reactive phenomenon - apologetics dressed up to counter the theological postulates of dominant cultures and civilizations with which Jews interacted. Now Jewish as well as non-Jewish religious thought encounters modernity, and this impressive volume of essays covers a growing field of Jewish scholarship and religious thought.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The retired four-star Army general, the second Republican to formally declare his candidacy for the party's Presidential nomination, has never run for office but is no stranger to politics. Serving in key diplomatic and military posts for the last four Presidents, Mr. Haig, as White House chief of staff to Richard Nixon, became a kind of regent in the final days, and played a central role in Mr. Nixon's resignation. As Secretary of State to President Reagan, he battled often with Mr. Reagan's White House aides over control of policy, resigning in 1982 with a declaration that the Adminstration had moved away from the ''careful course'' he and the President had laid out. Mr. Haig has one thing many other candidates of both parties do not - high name recognition in the public opinion polls. But that is not necessarily an advantage; he also has what are known in the trade as high ''negatives.'' He is, he acknowledges, a very dark horse.

In Columbia, S.C., such a photographer was Richard Samuel Roberts, who operated a studio for about 15 years - until his death in 1936. His customers were the proud, the patient and the pathetic - hewers of wood and those whom W. E. B. Du Bois called ''the talented tenth.'' The nearly 200 pictures in A TRUE LIKENESS: The Black South of Richard Samuel Roberts 1920-1936 (Bruccoli Clark/Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, Cloth, $34.50; Paper, $19.95) were selected from 3,000 glass plates stored in a crawl space under the Roberts home. They have been cleaned and restored by Phillip C. Dunn, an associate professor in the art department at the University of South Carolina. About 125 Columbians identified the subjects, among whom are George A. Elmore, who challenged South Carolina's all-white voting in a 1947 primary and won; Annie E. Plunkett, better known as Annie Greene Nelson, one of the state's first black woman novelists; Malinda Bolden, a schoolteacher whose grandson Charles became an astronaut; and future doctors and teachers who went North to college and returned to work and establish institutions to help others. One unidentified woman is pictured twice - once in her maid's apron, once with her jewelry and no apron. Roberts's pictures and the text by Mr. Dunn and his co-editor, Thomas L. Johnson, the assistant director of the South Caroliniana Library at the University of South Carolina, constitute a rich source for the history of a 1920's and 1930's Southern black urban community.",1987-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The Israeli, an air force officer, is accused of recruiting an American intelligence analyst as a spy. Page A1 Israel's Herut Party elected a chairman, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who urged the 2,000 Herut convention delegates to fight any attempt to force Israel to relinquish the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. A9 In Siberia, remains of labor camps were shown to Western reporters. The Kolyma camps were where prisoners of the Stalin era were housed between their shifts at hard labor. A1 Margaret Thatcher's Soviet visit is a ''historic mission'' for peace, she said. But the British Prime Minister's first full day in the country had the tone and trappings of an election campaign at home. A8 An emigration plan for Soviet Jews will send emigres to Israel by way of Rumania, making it more difficult for them to settle in Europe or the United States instead, said an American rabbi who said he had negotiated the new procedure. A8 The Pope beatified five people in a move that could revive old disputes in Spain. Three of the five were Carmelite nuns who were executed in one of the most vicious phases of the Spanish Civil War. A7 News analysis: Andreas Papandreou faced down what was depicted in Greece as an American-backed threat from Turkey. But he traded short-term domestic political gains for long-term economic and diplomatic liabilities. A2 In Haiti, voter turnout was huge and political leaders and American observers said the voting seemed overwhelmingly in favor of a new constitution that promises freedom from past tyrannies. A3 P. W. Botha has begun his campaign for election with charges about the source of his opponents' funds and an excursion into the territory of his far-right rivals. A whites-only election is on May 6. A3 Japan is seen as an unfair trader by many in Washington, who resent that the world's second-largest economy exports everywhere but is reluctant to open its own markets. D1 News analysis: Chip dispute D11 NATIONAL A10-17, B6 The U.S. dollar plunged further against the yen today, at one point hitting a record low of 144.70 yen in the Tokyo foreign exchange market. This was the lowest since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940's. A1 The President lobbied vigorously over the weekend to sustain his veto of an $88 billion highway and mass transit bill that would also allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour on rural Interstates. A1 A Marine guard's conflicting stories about how he became entangled with a Soviet agent at the American Embassy in Moscow were told to investigators in three seperate interviews last year. The guard is accused of espionage. A1 Electrical power during nuclear war could be generated by several hundred small nuclear reactors that the Air Force is considering building, say Air Force, Department of Energy, Congressional and industry officials. A13 Protecting Nebraska's Platte River is the aim of an Audubon Society campaign. Conservationists say sandhill cranes are threatened by plans to divert the river for municipal and agricultural use. A10 The Supreme Court's senior liberal, William J. Brennan Jr., has written or assigned the majority opinions in all five of this term's most important decisions. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has consistently dissented. A10 The move off welfare and into a job is being made easier for people who live in Massachusetts, Michigan and about 22 other states that have been experimenting with intensive counseling, education and training programs. A14 Was a snowwoman obscene, art or just a pile of snow? Milwaukee's Chief Prosecutor will consider the question as he decides whether to try a woman for taking her ax to a snow sculpture of a woman in a bikini.

Kennedy High School in the Bronx and suburban New Rochelle High School, reveals that racial and ethnic divisions remain. New Rochelle's schools superintendent says the high school is desegregated, ''but I'm not sure if it fulfills the ideal of an integrated school. I'm not sure the ideal of an integrated school exists in our country today.'' A1 An Arturo Toscanini collection of scores, letters, recordings and memorabilia that has been inaccessible since 1970 has been acquired by the New York Public Library under an agreement concluded last December. A1 Foster-care will not be withdrawn this summer, John Cardinal O'Connor said, setting aside his threat to stop Roman Catholic group services because a Federal court has requires that teen-agers be given birth control and abortion services. The Cardinal plans a court appeal. B1 Tuberculosis among homeless men in New York City is a rapidly growing problem, health officials say. The outbreak is so serious that last summer the city began sending health workers into the shelters to deliver medication. B1 A trash-energy plant was destroyed in Westbury, L.I.

us,Q & A,"Q.What is meant by first, second, and third degree burns? A.The degree of a burn refers to the extento which heat has destroyed layers of skin, according to Dr. Bruce Aschauer of the University of California at Irvine. A first degree burn such as a sunburn results in some redness and swelling. These burns heal fairly quickly in a few days without any scarring. A second degree burn is much deeper and actually destroys some layers of skin, resulting in the formation of blisters. No scarring results and the skin regenerates after a few weeks. In a third degree burn, the heat completely destroys the upper layers of skin including accessory skin structures like hair and sweat glands. The burned area takes on a white leather-like appearance and normal skin does not regenerate. Third-degree burns are treated with skin grafts, in which thin layers of skin are removed from an unburned part of the body and grafted onto the burned portions. One way to minimize the severity of any burn is to cool it by applying an ice pack or cold water. Q.Is the bite of a black widow spider deadly? A.Except in the elderly or very young, death does not normally occur from the bite of a black widow spider, according to the Pennsylvania State University Extension Service. However, the neurotoxic venom that a black widow releases when it bites makes the victim very sick. It can cause a number of reactions such as nausea, chills, slight fever, rise in blood pressure, retention of urine, burning sensations of the skin, fatigue, motor disturbances, breathing difficulty, constipation and muscle aches, particularly in the abdomen. Pain does not occur until one to two hours after the bite. The symptoms usually end after four days.",1987-03-31T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 1987","Markets Stock and bond prices plunged in tumultuous selling set off by the unrelenting decline in the dollar. Pressure on both markets was intense from the start of trading as investors feared that an unchecked drop in the dollar would strengthen inflation and force interest rates higher; the currency has fallen decisively since Washington announced trade retaliation against Japan on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average, off a stunning 79 points after a half-hour of trading, finished at 2,278.41, for a 57.39-point loss - its third-worst one-day drop. [ Page A1. ] Treasury bond prices fell sharply, hitting their lowest levels since last fall, as weakness in the dollar caused a modest amount of selling by foreign investors and cast a pall over the domestic market. [ D1. ] Stock index futures closed lower, partly recovering from a sharp drop in early trading. [ D26. ] Money managers predicted that stock prices would climb after a correction runs its course. [ D1. ] Stock traders contended that the Big Board's specialist system could have done a better job of stabilizing the market by placing its own capital at risk. [ D5. ] The dollar steadied against the Japanese yen in Western markets after an early flurry of selling in Tokyo and other overseas markets, but the dollar still finished below Friday's close. For the first time in more than a week, there was an absence of coordinated intervention by central banks to shore up the dollar. On the Comex, gold fell $1.60, to $421.10. [ D5. ] A new setup to stabilize exchange rates while maintaining them at ''present parities'' was advocated by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France. [ D23. ] Companies Rupert Murdoch agreed to buy Harper & Row for $300 million, in a move to expand his global empire of publishing, film and broadcasting interests. The $65-a-share offer far exceeded two other bids made for the 170-year-old publishing house. [ A1. ] John S. R. Shad is donating most of a $30 million gift to the Harvard Business School to support a program on ethics. The departing S.E.C. chairman cited concern about the involvement of graduates from leading business schools in insider-trading abuses. [ D1. ] Time Inc. has trimmed about 200 magazine employees, both editorial and business, in the last three months, and may trim 200 more by November as part of a belt-tightening process. [ D1. ] The former owner of Home State Savings Bank was sentenced to three and a half years in prison and ordered to pay $22 million in restitution for his role in the thrift unit's collapse. [ D1. ] The Shearson stock sale has been designed to keep important executives and employees at the brokerage. The prospectus filed by American Express includes lucrative stock purchase plans. [ D14. ] Carl H. Lindner took charge of Penn Central in a management shake-up designed to move the company into ''the next phase of its growth.'' The possible spinoff of Penn Central's electronics subsidiaries will also be studied. [ D2. ] The Henley Group disclosed it owns a large stake in Santa Fe Southern Pacific, touching off takeover speculation. [ D10. ] The Economy President Reagan has entered a U.S.-Japan dispute on telecommunications. In a letter to Japan's Prime Minister, Mr. Reagan reasserted American requests that Japan honor a commitment to allow 33 percent foreign participation in a new telecommunication venture, according to Congressional aides. [ D6. ] The Federal ethics office has requested an inquiry by the Justice Department on whether Lee H. Henkel Jr. of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board violated criminal laws. The move relates to a proposal made by Mr. Henkel that would have aided a thrift unit with which he has had extensive business dealings. [ D13. ] New-home sales fell for a second consecutive month in February, declining by 2.7 percent. The drop was led by a 19.4 percent plunge in sales in the Northeast. [ D2. ] Today's Columns Corporate renewal is the latest concern of Robert Waterman, a co-author of ''In Search of Excellence.'' He has addressed those concerns by studying resurrected corporate giants, such as Ford, and ''masters of renewal,'' such as I.B.M. Talking Business. [ D2. ] The buyers of stock index put options won a rare victory in their battle with the call buyers. This contest has meant extraordinary growth for the four-year-old market. Market Place.
