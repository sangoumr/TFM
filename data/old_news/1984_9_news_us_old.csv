Silas Ermineskin, 18, a born storyteller and Huck Finnian scamp, narrates tales about his Indian reservation in Alberta. There's his troublemaking buddy, Frank Fence-post, presenting himself as the chief of the Onagatihies (sometimes Onadatchies) to suburban hunters looking for a guide; Mad Etta, a 400-pound medicine woman whose office is a tree-trunk chair; the unanimously despised Chief Tom and his wicked girlfriend, Samantha Yellowknees; and other ne'er-do-wells whose lives we come to cherish. Bound together by a common history of official mistreatment, these people have a finely tuned instinct for silence, mutual help and deadpan trickery. When Silas and his friends cross the borders of the law - to hide a friend escaping from a bogus murder charge by turning him into a law-abiding Pakistani (''He works as a speed bump at a parking lot downtown,'' Silas tells inquiring police) or to prevent the farm of an old dead friend from falling to profiteering ''computer farmers'' by razing its house with a pickup truck - he carries us along with him. Not all the stories are funny, though, and some, like ''Strings,'' ''Green Candles'' and ''Nests,'' seem to challenge the limits of human rage, jealousy and sanity. Unsentimentally poignant, full of the energy and drama of folk tales, these marvelous stories go far in dispelling many lingering myths and misconceptions about the North American Indians - none greater, perhaps, than the one that says they have no sense of humor.",1984-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, and Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, said on leaving a negotiating session that ''serious obstacles'' were blocking formation of a coalition cabinet. They parted without setting a date for a new meeting. (Page 1, Column 4.) Tens of thousands of Sikhs turned out for an anti-Government rally in India's Punjab state at which religious leaders called for a mass march to liberate their Golden Temple, their holiest shrine, from army occupation. They also shouted their approval for a merger of conflicting Sikh political factions into a unified party known as Akali Dal. The demonstration was also intended to ratify a broad anti- Government program that Indians believe could lead to sharper confrontations with supporters of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

They are generally assumed to represent his Toryism at its most pigheaded and least rewarding; Joseph Wood Krutch, in his biography of Johnson, strikes the appropriate note of embarrassment when he describes ''Taxation No Tyranny'' as ''the most unfortunate of his literary productions.''

There were minor bugs - a chunk of ice that formed around a waste water vent had to be swatted away with the craft's space arm and a small oxygen leak briefly knotted some brows - but they were overshadowed by the six-day flight's triumphs. Three satellites were catapulted into orbit (redemption for two failed launches from the sister ship Challenger in February), a 102-foot solar panel was unfurled and an experimental drug-manufacturing device took advantage of the weightlessness to produce a sample of an ultrapure hormone. Not that there was much time for Discovery to rest on its laurels.

us,FICTION,"-year-old named Kate, while populating and furnishing her new doll house, creates fantasies that - unknown to her - are acted out by the real-life occupants of a rooming house miles away in central London. Since dolls, like art, imitate life, the events Kate inflicts upon her miniatures mimic the goings-on of her own real-life household in placid Wimbledon Common. Such a premise for a novel may feel awkward at first, but Miss Waugh's smooth and generous descriptive prose will win you over. Writing in a flat, ironic tone, that oh-so-British trademark of satiric fiction, Miss Waugh creates a world like that of her father, Evelyn, in which anything goes. This includes a virgin birth and the metamorphosis of a poodle into an apocalyptic, baby-eating dragon. And when Rumania, Kate's mother, gets pregnant, so does one of Kate's dolls. Margery MacDonald, an unrelated rooming house occupant in Notting Hill does, too. Margery's is the virgin birth. What makes ''Kate's House'' delightful is partly the fun Miss Waugh pokes at middle-class values - both those particularly British, like doting on the Royal Family, and those more universal, like Roman Catholicism and racial prejudice (Margery thinks that black people are the ''incubators of strange germs''). But the charm of this novel derives also from Kate herself. When Kate shaves the hair off all her stuffed animals, Miss Waugh is re-creating the innocently macabre humor resplendent among 4-year-olds. In case you forgot what that was like, ''Kate's House'' will help you remember.",1984-09-09T05:00:00+0000

Analysts had expected the dollar to weaken during August. ''The correction that was in all the charts didn't happen,'' one trader said, and many now expect the dollar to maintain its current high level for a long time.

Isolated from the rest of the world in what they called their ''torture chamber,'' the collaborators suffered from writer's block together, listened to Mozart records together, and improvised scenes from the play together. Much of their afternoon work sessions, however, was devoted to arguing. They argued about scenes and words, and the order of scenes and words. They argued about who would say what in the film. They even argued about which of them would cook dinner. In the end, nothing went into the movie that both did not agree upon; and on Wednesday at the Paramount and Tower East - some two and half years after their first argument - ''Amadeus,'' the motion picture starring Tom Hulce and F.

PLAYS WITHIN PLAYS THAT COMMENT ON OURSELVES","''Life,'' Oscar Wilde quipped, ''imitates art.'' Yes and no, but Wilde forgot to mention that art also imitates art. A quick glance up and down Broadway makes the point. The stage is stage-struck. In ''The Real Thing,'' ''La Cage Aux Folles,'' ''Noises Off,'' ''42nd Street,'' ''Dream Girls'' and ''Chorus Line,'' theater turns to itself for subject matter. All the world's a stage - there's nothing new about the metaphor. What's new is how obssessed popular theater has become with the comparison, how the conceit functions, and the psychological assumptions that underpin it. The poor players no longer strut and fret their hour upon the stage, they kick up their heels and belt out a song to celebrate a new-found freedom in lifestyle and role choice.

Chapters full of conversation, a rapid unfolding of conflict and a short time span make Ray Locke's second novel seem more a play than a novel. Set in a small Mississippi town in 1954, ''Seldom Sung Songs'' chronicles one day in the life of the Kantwiths, a patriarchal, land-poor, once aristocratic family. It is no ordinary day, however; the catalyst for the novel's development is the return of the body of the eldest son, killed two years before in Korea. The setting provides an effective microcosm of the South prior to the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision ending public school segregation. We see the ambiguous and complex interaction of the white and black worlds: how two women, one white, the other black, can privately be best of friends yet occupy different spheres of society; the taboos and hypocrisy of a social class unwilling to regognize that it no longer holds the elevated position it once did; the way a young black man of intelligence and promise can be forever banished from his hometown for insulting a white man. While the novel's controlling force throughout is Tom Kantwith, the father, he exists primarily offstage, and we see him largely through the way he has affected the female characters. It is in their presentation that Mr. Locke paints his most vivid and believable portraits.",1984-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Michael Eisner, Mr. Diller's No. 2, also resigned from Paramount, while Frank Mancuso, president of Paramount's Motion Picture Group was chosen to head the entire studio.

Davis, head of G.&W., was reportedly souring. The shuffle may come to involve even more studios, depending on where Mr. Eisner ends up.

The casus belli was a tight cap on New York's sewage effluent proposed by Representative James Howard of New Jersey. Resolution was achieved when Mr. Howard consented to make the cap no tighter than the city could wear without a headache. Why would Mr. Howard want to give the city a headache? New York, to its shame, daily dumps 220 million gallons of raw sewage into the Hudson and East Rivers. But it has two big sewage treatment plants under construction, due to come on line in 1986 and 1987. Perhaps Mr. Howard feared the schedule would slip, as it has twice already. But construction is now six months ahead of schedule. He's agreed that sewage doesn't have to be limited until the date the plants are meant to open.","What was the fuss all about?

But the new measure, which will permit judges and jurors to weigh the relative credibility of children and their purported victimizers, applies only to crimes committed on or after next Nov. 1.

The bodyguards may have killed the suicide bomber before he could reach his goal, a driveway under the embassy where an explosion would have caused the building to collapse. (Page 1, Column 1.)

us,IN SHORT,"A Dakota farm boy turned sailor stumbles into the port of an unnamed guerrilla-torn country in Central America to search for his hometown sweetheart, Sally, who lives in the mountains, teaching peasants to read. The sailor, named McQuade, would be a modern frontier hero except that he is going mad, increasingly unable to distinguish hallucinations of home from his present circumstances. Not surprisingly, shortly after he finds Sally, decked with flowers and poised on a veranda like a prairie bride, he loses her. In this surrealist adventure tale, Mark Smith tries to bring unity and understanding to Central American revolutions, United States intervention, madness and heroism. In his prose style, he wants to evoke the absurdity of war and the exoticism of Latin America, but his characters often seem vague, mere caricatures. Besides McQuade and Sally, they include Fortune, a heart-of-gold mercenary; Gabriella, his street girl; a pair of suspicious merchants with the aliases de Groot and Pendleton (much like Tweedledee and Tweedledum); a daft American ambassador and his daughter, who, humiliated by an unrequited love, wills herself into a coma. Unfortunately, the dialogue is heavy-handed, at times rife with cliches. (When McQuade arrives, Sally says, ''And here you are . . . like a bee in the flower.'' ''Smoke Street'' has an obtrusively male sensibility, and yet the author's feeling about this maleness remains unclear. For example, an Army captain says, ''I can understand killing in passion, it is like making love to your young mistress with whom you are infatuated.''",1984-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Though no other major banks followed Morgan's lead, analysts predicted the big banks would drop their prime rates in the near future. The cut comes at a time when interest rates have declined, when the economy has slowed appreciably and when many Federal Reserve watchers are convinced that the central bank has eased its monetary policy. If the drop becomes an industry-wide move, this should weaken interest rates further, analysts said. The dollar went into a free fall on foreign exchange markets, partly in reaction to the prime rate cut, partly because the Labor Department reported a five-tenths of one percent spurt in consumer prices during August, but also because of a huge intervention effort on the part of the West German central bank to support its sagging mark. The Deutsche Bundesbank reportedly spent $450 million to support the mark, which had fallen as low as 3.177 to the dollar. Once the dollar began to fall, it lost about 4 percent of its value against the mark in 90 minutes, closing in New York at 3.043 marks.

The subject is New York's modeling industry. One of the chief characters is a tall young lady who bears at least a passing resemblance to Brooke Shields, complete with protective mother. And the entire production is a glossy testimonial to popular fantasies of the chic life in New York, with its posh stores, beautiful people and seductive promises of easy sex and accessible drugs.

She will next appear in the miniseries ''Mistral's Daughter,'' which begins tomorrow on CBS- TV. A woman with superb posture, a sharp, direct gaze and chiseled features, she says: ''One must have tremendous willpower and a respect for the body, not just so the results will please someone else, but as a respect for life itself. Beauty is a result of the state of your soul. If you are afraid, you age 20 years. You should learn to see yourself in a good situation.'' AIMEE TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF her on a Paris street, hidden behind a cloud of black hair and big dark glasses - shorter than one imagines - it would be easy to forget that she is a symbol of seductive womanliness. Easy, that is, until she smiles. Then the seduction truly begins. And when she starts to speak, as any of those who saw her in ''A Man and a Woman'' will remember, the entrapment is complete. ''If I am beautiful,'' she says, ''well, it starts with the look you begin life with. For me, a beautiful woman is Ava Gardner. After 30, even 25, it is what's within you that counts. What I hope is that as I grow older I do not lose my sensuality.'' Of her current relationship with the Parisian designer Emanuel Ungaro, she says, ''What can I say when he told Italian television two years ago that he has waited to meet me for 20 years.",1984-09-23T05:00:00+0000

The lives of its residents revolve mostly around work and church. Yet this insulated little town is the scene of an extraordinary experiment in reconstructing the shattered lives of eight Cambodian children orphaned by war and horror half a world away. To youngsters born in a land of sugar palms and sarongs, nothing could have been more alien than the north country, where since 1980 they have been full, sharing members of a family assembled by a Congregationalist minister, the Rev.

Buy a medium-size wine rack, in black iron or natural wood, with room for 40 or 50 bottles. This will cost around $100. Then drop in at a trendy wine shop and buy a case of, oh, Chateau Montrose 1961. This will cost around $900. That's it. You have used up your $1,000. Your cellar is small, but distinguished, and it entitles you to say, whenever you wish: ''Of course, I haven't touched my '61s yet.'' If you already have a wine rack, you might choose a case of the 1975 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild. It will run you just about $1,000. In either instance, you have made no provision for sales tax, which will come to about $80 in New York. But no one ever said being a connoisseur was easy. When it comes to variety, a one-case cellar obviously leaves something to be desired. But it does serve to show how many possibilities there are when it comes to spending $1,000 on wine. Some enthusiasts do not hesitate to spend that much on a single bottle. Others - admittedly not in the connoisseur class - never spend more than $4 a bottle. There are collectors who keep only French wines. Some specialize in Bordeaux; some, even in one or two chateaus in Bordeaux. There are Italian cellars and German cellars and cellars devoted entirely to California cabernets.",1984-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,THE JEOPARDY OF CHILDREN ON THE STAND,"The charge was the sexual abuse of children, and as in many crimes, the best witnesses were the alleged victims. But could the adults serving as prosecutor, defense attorneys, judge and jurors rely on the children's testimony? Six children took the stand in Minnesota last week to accuse two adults from their neighborhood of sexually violating them, but the children were outnumbered by the adults and overwhelmed by the legal system. The trial left them in tears. The defendants were acquitted. In less than a year, sexual abuse of children has replaced drunken driving as the hidden crime competing most ferociously for public attention. Last week three day-care center workers in the Bronx were indicted on charges of sexually abusing children at their city-sponsored facility. The indictments were based on the testimony of 15 children. And in Washington an expert on child pornography shocked a Congressional subcommittee when she revealed her suspicion that there exists a network of day-care centers around the United States that serve ''child predators.'' Since the first major case broke at the Virginia McMartin Preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif., last spring, prosecutors across the country have forced the cases of accused child sex offenders to trial rather than dismiss them to save embarrassment to the young victims.",1984-09-23T05:00:00+0000

He also said Mr. Theroux skillfully catches ''the blend of coarseness, provincialism and bigotry that is one distinctive (and usually unexportable) brand of popular British humor.'' NEGRO: An Anthology, Collected and edited by Nancy Cunard. (Ungar, $19.95.) This work, virtually the size of a telephone directory, was privately published by Nancy Cunard in 1934, a time when most whites assumed blacks were inferior. The British shipping heiress set out to prove there was no superior race. Reviewing the commercially published 1970 edition, Julius Lester said in these pages, '' 'Negro' is the most ambitious anthology on blacks ever attempted. It covers practically every aspect of black life: history, literature, education, law, racial injustice, theater, art and music. It examines black life in the United States, the West Indies, South America, Europe and Africa.''",1984-09-23T05:00:00+0000

The reason is the embarrassing discovery that this program had resulted in a subsidy to multimillion-dollar residences in Trump Tower - a lapse that could have been overcome by eliminating condominiums and co-ops from the program. By also barring aid to rental units, the city is choking off valuable construction that over time repays the subsidy many times.",1984-09-29T05:00:00+0000

But this great American humorist drank to excess and died in 1933 when he was only 48. When ''Ring'' came out in 1977, V. S. Pritchett wrote in The Book Review, ''The clown was a sad man, and Jonathan Yardley shows us why with insight and sympathy.'' His biography ''is welcome,'' Mr. Pritchett added, ''for it tells a good deal about Lardner which had mystified us.'' TWO SERIOUS LADIES, by Jane Bowles. (Dutton, $7.95.) In 1967, John Ashbery commented in these pages that ''Jane Bowles is a writer's writer's writer. Few surface reputations are as glamorous as the underground one she has enjoyed since her novel 'Two Serious Ladies' was published in 1943.'' That story concerned the decline into debauchery of two staid women - a wealthy spinster seeking salvation and a married woman who takes a trip to Panama with her husband.

us,IN SHORT,"''The civilized,'' Isak Dinesen wrote, ''must take lessons in silence from the wild before they are accepted by it.'' While she was referring specifically to hunting in her adopted Kenya, the remark hints at a deeper truth about African life. Survival comes from adapting to it rather than superimposing order on it. In ''The Grass Rain,'' which is set in emerging Kenya, Eduardo Garrigues portrays both approaches. In this accomplished first novel he examines how so-called civilized people, Western and African alike, have disrupted the rhythms of Kenyan life - its countryside, wildlife and social order. Mr. Garrigues has written a fictional counterpart to Dinesen's ''Out of Africa,'' a paean to Kenya's red-earthed beauty, a lyrical cry against its corruption. Into this he has woven a taut suspense story that trades on the narrative paradox of the hunter and the hunted. Set in 1977, the story opens when an American ecologist, Bob Fender, arrives in Nairobi and discovers that his friend John Murphy has been killed in a violent accident. What he fails to suspect is that Murphy, a C.I.A. agent bent on infiltrating the nation's opposition party, was murdered. Mistaken as Murphy's replacement - a misunderstanding perpetuated by the American Embassy - Fender proceeds to the National Park where he begins his research on its grasslands. In a series of unpleasant coincidences, Fender realized he's being used to lure culprits suspected of trafficking in contraband ivory and machine guns, the very means by which the opposition party hopes to topple the Government.",1984-09-30T05:00:00+0000
