Shevardnadze, indicated before leaving Washington. Page 1 A Soviet state of transition, in which the country is wary of its past and uncertain of its future, coincides with Moscow's 70th anniversary under Communism next week. The commemoration promises to be a time of introspection. 1 News analysis: The planned meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan will include the signing of the first treaty banning a category of nuclear arms, but it is less assured of success in substantive terms than symbolic ones. 22 A survey of Moscow residents, using Western polling standards to measure public opinion, has found that they rank Mr. Gorbachev ahead of Stalin in importance to their country and do not expect much from the forthcoming summit meeting. 22 Ethnic friction in Yugoslavia has reached such levels in portions of the country's south that Yugoslavs have begun to talk of the possibility of ''civil war'' between Albanians and Slavs in a land decimated by World War II. 14 Pakistan's perceived tilt toward Iran in the Iran-Iraq war, including criticism of the American buildup in the Persian Gulf without condemnation of Iranian attacks, has provoked expressions of irritation by some senior Administration officials. 26 Communist officials from Tibet accused the Dalai Lama, its exiled spiritual leader, of fomenting the recent Tibetan riots, in the first official Chinese comments to foreign reporters since the unrest last month. 8 Japan will not ban Iranian imports 3 Africa nation opens doors to the French 11 Mozambique rebels burned bus passengers 3 Traumas from the past in Chile 20 Frank talk on AIDS bring praise for Uganda 25 NATIONAL 30-44, 58-60, 65 President Reagan's latest nominee for the Supreme Court, Douglas H. Ginsburg, is likely to find his confirmation hearings focusing on his work as the White House official in charge of Federal regulations, Senate aides said. 1 The President insisted again that the Senate should act quickly on his nomination of Judge Ginsburg, saying in his weekly radio address that he wanted ''no delays to gear up opposition or support.'' 35 Iowa's voters are more liberal than other Americans on many campaign issues, they like President Reagan less and they are skeptical of promises candidates make to them about farm spending, a New York Times/ CBS News Poll shows. 1 Lowering cost-of-living increases in some Government programs, which could affect pensions and veterans benefits, was discussed by negotiators from Congress and the White House as a deficit-cutting measure, officials said. 1 The Rev. Jesse Jackson's message to voters is a dual one, as a mainstream politician reaching for support from a broad spectrum and as a candidate whose positions are well to the left of the other Democratic Presidential contenders. 38 In the Pacific Northwest's drought, the worst since records have been kept, stranded salmon languish, seedlings die in the ground and residents brace for expected multimillion-dollar losses as the browning of the region continues. 30 Rise in executions widens debate 30 66 injured in toxic leak 30 Ex-Wedtech official testifies 37 Nastiness in Kentucky campaign 38 A town that likes a good fight 42 REGIONAL 46-56, 61-64, 66, 80 The New York Yankees will continue to play in the Bronx for at least 45 more years under terms of an agreement announced last night.

As in much of his other work, such as ''The Right Stuff,'' Mr. Wolfe's strategy is to somehow batter the reader into submission, using an incantatory repetition of certain emblematic phrases, (HIS FIRST NOVEL!), detailed description of people's clothing, hyperbole, interior monologue whenever he feels like it, and various other New Journalism devices he is apparently too fond of to give up. What is amazing is that he gets away with it. I read ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' straight through, in two sessions on two consecutive days, and enjoyed it enormously. It swept me right up. When he writes about process he knows what he is writing about, whether it's the Wall Street bond market, the Bronx District Attorney's Office, print and television journal-ism, or the working habits of sleazy lawyers -the man knows how to prepare and he knows how to research.

He is a big, tough man who does not throw his strength around but nevertheless is not one to be trifled with. He is dogged, competent, rather sensitive and completely honest. And since Mr. Valin is an expert writer who provides coherent plots and believable dialogue, it comes as no surprise that his Stoner books have taken hold.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

The press, avid to see Oscar Wilde, could not wait. Enterprising reporters ''came out of the sea,'' as Wilde picturesquely noted, their pens still wet with brine. In fact, they chartered a launch to bring them aboard. Wilde was in the captain's cabin and emerged to greet them clad in a great green coat that hung down almost to his feet. It was subjected to close inspection: the collar and cuffs were trimmed with seal or otter, and so was the material for the round cap, variously described as a smoking cap or a turban. Beneath the coat could be discerned a shirt with a wide Lord Byron collar and a sky-blue necktie, vaguely reminiscent of the costume of a modern mariner. He wore patent-leather shoes on his small feet.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Bonfire of the Vanities',"Now comes Tom Wolfe, aging enfant terrible, with his first novel, (his first novel!), six hundred and fifty-nine pages of raw energy about New York City and various of its inhabitants - a big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go. As in much of his other work, such as ''The Right Stuff,'' Mr. Wolfe's strategy is to somehow batter the reader into submission, using an incantatory repetition of certain emblematic phrases, (HIS FIRST NOVEL!), detailed description of people's clothing, hyperbole, interior monologue whenever he feels like it, and various other New Journalism devices he is apparently too fond of to give up. What is amazing is that he gets away with it. I read ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' straight through, in two sessions on two consecutive days, and enjoyed it enormously. It swept me right up. When he writes about process he knows what he is writing about, whether it's the Wall Street bond market, the Bronx District Attorney's Office, print and television journal-ism, or the working habits of sleazy lawyers -the man knows how to prepare and he knows how to research. As well, he knows how to tell a story, and how to make us laugh, qualities not always present in the work of some of the more polished, more literary or ultimately more ambitious novelists of his generation.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Why It's Time for Public TV to Go Private,"PUBLIC TELEVISION IS SUP-posed to be in crisis: Where is its soul, its reason, its purpose, the spirit that would make it, as E. B. White once wrote, ''our Lyceum, our Chautauqua, our Minsky's and our Camelot''? It is hard to say, although for some time now the crisis has been cast in terms of God overcome by mammon. Public television is supposed to be broke. Phrases like ''declining Federal support'' and ''chronic underfinancing'' figure in almost all descriptions.

Toklas Cook Book' without the recipes.'' In his ''Nantucket Diary'' Mr. Rorem corrects this omission. Kept between the ages of 49 and 62, a period during which Mr. Rorem took up part-time residence on Nantucket, ''The Nantucket Diary'' is where the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer does his personal, professional and household accounting. Mr. Rorem catalogues meals consumed, physicians consulted, guests entertained, music commissioned, reviews written, books read, grudges nursed, memories savored. For all the proper names, musical, famous and otherwise, that appear in these pages, the book does not trade in gossip; there are but one or two anecdotes one itches to repeat. This volume, less sexually and emotionally charged than earlier installments of his ''Diary,'' chronicles the postdrinking, postsmoking, and seemingly postprofligate years; by his own admission, Mr. Rorem has come to value discretion. ''The mood is quieter. After a certain age, certain subjects become embarrassingly dull and nobody's business. One of these is sexual intercourse, the other is the injustice of personal sorrow.'' The intimacies recounted here are those of daily life, and, not unlike daily life, the entries often repeat themselves. The author's subjects are, for the most part, disarmingly benign: work, his sweet tooth, friends and his elderly parents, about whom some of the most affecting passages in the book are written. Mr. Rorem's candor and wit help relieve the self-consciousness and stiltedness that diaries written to be read are susceptible to. ''The Nantucket Diary'' is engaging, not profound. For this Mr. Rorem makes no apology: ''As though the very nature of diaries were not based on the Importance of Unimportance.''",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

But as the horses passed the stands for the second time, Le Ronceray had to give way to Gacko, a 6-year-old French gelding ridden by Roger Duchene. Gacko maintained his lead over the remainder of the 19 jumps, leaving the battle for second place to Inlander and Gateshead, who finished a head apart in that order. Gacko covered the two miles and five furlongs in 5:15 1/5. He paid $15.60 for $2 to win. Sacahuista Captures Spinster: Sacahuista led all the way yesterday to capture the $228,300 Spinster Stakes at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. The 3-year-old filly, trained by D. Wayne Lukas and ridden by Randy Romero, covered the one and one-eighth miles in 1:48 3/5 in scoring a three-length victory and paid $4.80 for $2 to win. Ms. Margi was second and Tall Poppy was third. (AP) Blew by Em Wins: Blew by Em, ridden by Chris Antley, closed strongly for a two-length victory yesterday in the $92,850 Pilgrim Stakes for 2-year-olds at Aqueduct. The son of Air Forbes Won and Mistress Kipling, bred in Ireland, went the mile and an eighth in 1:53 3/5. Cefis finished second and Smart Lad was third. The victory was Blew by Em's third in four career starts. (AP) Saratoga Passage Takes Norfolk: At Santa Anita in Arcadia, Calif., Saratoga Passage, a 12-to-1 shot who was nearly scratched from the race, ran through the rain over a sloppy track yesterday to win the $301,900 Norfolk Stakes for 2-year-olds. Ridden by Joe Steiner, Saratoga Passage beat Purdue King by 2 1/2 lengths while the 3-2 favorite, Success Express, finished fourth. Saratoga Passage, a son of Pirateer owned by Saratoga I Stable of Oak Harbor, Wash., ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:45. He returned $27 for $2 to win.(AP)",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

Whatever their background, they sell the personality of their cooking, adding an individual touch to the catered party. Their rates are less than full-service - about $25 to $35 a head, as opposed to as much as $85 or more - and depend completely on the menu and work desired.

us,A DIFFERENT INDEPENDENCE DAY,"For many black Americans, the anniversary of the day their ancestors were freed from slavery is an independence day meriting at least as much to-do as the Fourth of July. In O FREEDOM! Afro-American Emancipation Celebrations (University of Tennessee, $24.95), William H. Wiggins Jr., a fellow of the Folklore Institute at Indiana University, brings much-deserved scholarly attention to the longstanding black American tradition of emancipation celebrations. While many of the ''freedom jubilees'' in the book are tied to the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1865, or to other state or local abolitions of slavery, Mr. Wiggins points out that ''like many of their slave celebrants, these celebrations have no recorded date of birth. And . . . the historical circumstances which gave birth to these events are also not known.'' He cites at least 15 different celebration dates around the country and points out that there is no consensus as to which should be ''the official day.' '' The celebrations, which are nowadays held primarily in rural and smaller urban communities, range from church ceremonies to secular good-time parties with baseball and barbecue. The author makes clear the links between current styles of celebration and various slave festivities and points out how the politics of protest and the successful campaign to have Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday named a national holiday also continue the freedom jubilee tradition. In this lively study - part history, part ethnography, and part personal reminiscence -Mr. Wiggins has combined painstaking research and detailed interviews with a relaxed, readable writing style to produce a richly textured and fascinating account of a little-known slice of Americana.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

Moreover, when the two came together, it cannot be said that the stock market collapse was the cause of the business contraction. They responded to common causes. Viewed over a year or two, in fact, the reverse was more important. Business contraction, when it came, pushed stock prices down. In the past, many of the great stock market declines were incidents of more general financial panic. Recurrent waves of bank failures and a great decline in the money stock were central features of the Great Contraction from 1929 to 1932.

''On his sixty-fifth birthday Frank Kellerman locked himself inside an old stone schoolhouse filled with honey bees,'' begins Steve Heller's subtle first novel. For the next seven days, Frank (or Lucky, as he was called before old age, diabetes, injury and loneliness took their toll), tells his life story to his only friends, the bees. As a boy in Missouri, Frank sold newspapers outside the political boss Tom Pendergast's Kansas City headquarters, and Al Capone once gave him a ride. He's also been an electrician, a diesel mechanic, a gandy dancer, a janitor and the best auto mechanic in Yukon, Okla. Frank's father, a German immigrant, tried to crush his son's spirit; throughout his life, without wanting to, Frank has done the same to his own son, Curly. Now, facing death, he wants to leave something behind - a 1932 Model 18 Ford Deluxe Roadster, like the one his father once destroyed. Frank thinks his car will power Curly's dreams, and Mr. Heller hints that it may. But these hints are confusing, part of a portentous ending that doesn't fit comfortably with the rest of the book. Instead, ''The Automotive History of Lucky Kellerman'' is strongest in a succession of vivid scenes from Frank's life on the job and at home. Most haunting is ''the pretend season,'' when Frank, trapped in a hip cast, watches day by day through his window as 10-year-old Curly acts out the progress of the 1961 home run duel between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Like a number of vignettes in Mr. Heller's quiet and often beautiful book, such unspoken moments between father and son create an unforgettable image.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

He believes his generation, baby boomers born from the mid-1940's to the early 1960's, are destined for hard times indeed. Pulling together worst-case scenarios drawn from Census Bureau projections, testimony to Congress, books and articles, he warns that many of his contemporaries will end up old and poor. In his view, middle-class women are especially vulnerable. Social Security and Medicare will either be bankrupted or drastically reduced, because we are not saving to pay for the vastly increased numbers who would qualify under present laws. Young people who waited to start families until their late 30's will discover, when they grow old, that the working population will by then be too small and poor to support them. He warns of an ethnic gulf in some parts of the country, with elderly whites looking in vain for support from a largely black and Hispanic working population with other priorities. And everybody, young and old, will be staggering under the trauma of Government debt. Mr. Longman's approach has been denigrated as ''granny-bashing.'' He argues that age-based entitlement, notably Social Security, should be replaced with programs limited to the needy. These should be financed by taxes on consumption, with incentives for savers to help support the elderly, and for potential parents to alter the demographic curve. Mr. Longman addresses real issues, but his analysis is skewed by his experience in the fiscally erratic Reagan era. New taxes and reductions in swollen defense budgets might clear away at least some of the shadows in his crystal ball.",1987-11-01T05:00:00+0000

The flag may have made the going rough, but it did call attention to the Berlin contingent.

us,A Guide to the National Horse Show,"The 104th National Horse Show runs today through Sunday at Madison Square Garden, with competition in several categories and three types of exhibition performances. There are sessions at 9 A.M. (except Friday), 1:30 P.M. (1 P.M. Thursday) and 7:30 P.M. daily, but the most interesting events for the non-specialist are in the afternoon and evening sessions. Following are highlights of each day's schedule. Afternoon International and Open Jumpers Event - The jumpers compete over the highest and most difficult obstacles in the show, and nothing counts but clearing the jumps and, in some events, doing so in the fastest time. This class include entries from the four international teams -the United States, Britain, Canada and France - competing here, as well as ''open'' jumpers, the professionals competing individually. Saddlebred Three-Gaited Event; Saddlebred Five-Gaited Event - Saddlebreds evolved from horses bred by farmers and ranchers who needed to traverse many acres quickly yet comfortably. Now they are bred for showing, some with three ''natural'' gaits (walk, trot, canter) enhanced by high-stepping hooves, arched necks and other flourishes; others with two additional gaits taught by man, the slow-gait and the rack. There are saddlebred events daily except Sunday. Evening Open Jumper Power and Speed Event - Combining big obstacles with fastest times on the first round (no jumpoff) makes this a difficult event. Parade of the International Teams - This is the show's formal opening ceremony, done Olympic-style, with the national anthems of each team played by a brass band that always makes the horses prance skittishly around the arena. Tomorrow Afternoon New York City Mounted Police Musical Ride - This is an exhibition by a score or so of New York's Finest equine pairs, the riders carrying flags, the horses executing drill-team movements to brisk, big band-style music. One of the most delightful events of the show. Repeated Wedneday night, Friday afternoon and as the final event Sunday night. Evening Bank of Montreal Nations' Cup for International Teams:This is jumping at its finest, with the four teams here representing the same nations that were the top four finishers in this year's world championships. Open Jumper Event: Similar competition to the international event, featuring individual professional riders. Thursday, Nov. 5 Afternoon International and Open Jumpers Event: Note the half-hour earlier starting time, on this day only. Evening Regular Working Hunter Formal Attire Event:Hunters compete over jumps that resemble obstacles found while fox hunting. Unlike the Open division, entries are judged on their jumping form, pace and behavior. In tonight's event, the rider must wear formal fox-hunting attire, the equestrian equivalent of top hat and tails. Dressage Exhibition: Often described as ballet on horseback, dressage is what the famed Lippizaner horses perform. Reiner Klimke, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984, will give this exhibition performance, to be repeated Friday evening and both Saturday and Sunday afternoon and evening. International and Open Jumpers, Puissance Stake: In French, puissance means power; the highlight of this contest is an imitation stone wall that is raised with each round until only the winner clears it. The world indoor record for the wall is 7 feet 7 1/2 inches. Friday, Nov. 6 Afternoon U.S. Pony Clubs Mounted Games: These are reminiscent of ''field day'' in elementary school, with games such as carrying eggs on spoons, sack races and other relays for children on ponies. The kids compete again Friday evening, Saturday afternoon and evening and for their championship on Sunday afternoon. Evening International and Open Jumpers, Gamblers Choice Stake: Here, obstacles are assigned a point value, depending on their difficulty, and the rider may jump them in any order he wishes within a prescribed time limit, trying to accumulate the most points. It always features some slapdash, quick-turning, hair-raising rides. Saturday, Nov. 7 Afternoon International and Open Jumpers: The team riders and individual professionals compete in a class where speed is emphasized. N.H.S. Saddle Seat Championship, ''Good Hands'' Final: This is the national championship for riders 18 and under in saddlebred-type competition, but with the rider's form, not the horse's, being judged. Evening International and Open Jumpers, Mercedes Grand Prix of New York: Along with the Nations' Cup, this is perhaps the most glamorous jumping event of the show. Sunday, Nov. 8 Afternoon International and Open Jumpers, Fault and Out: As the name implies, in this event one rail knocked down or one refusal immediately eliminates the entry. Time will decide among ties. A.S.P.C.A. Maclay National Championship Finals: This is the national championship for riders 18 and under in hunter-type competition, with the rider's form, not the horse's, being judged. Evening International and Open Jumpers ''Big Apple'' Grand Prix: Points earned here count toward the American Grandprix Association's Rider and Horse of the Year awards. Awards Ceremonies: Awards will be presented to the leading Open Jumping division rider, leading International division rider, leading Foreign International rider, and to the winning International Team.",1987-11-03T05:00:00+0000

Theoretically, if you fired a shot straight up, the bullet would fall right back down on you, according to Officer Frank S. DiMario, master firearms instructor at the New York City Police Academy. In fact, however, the size of the bullet, the angle at which it is fired and factors like wind and humidity alter a bullet's path. Even fired at a very slight angle, ''a simple little .22-caliber bullet will land over a mile away,'' he said.

us,Decision on Harmon,"Based on a ruling by an arbitrator, John Culver, a former Senator from Iowa, Ronnie Harmon does not have to repay Norby Walters most of the money he received from the agent with whom he had a contract from March 1985 until August 1986. According to a report yesterday in The Atlanta Constitution, Culver voided the contract that Harmon signed on the ground that Walters and Lloyd Bloom, an associate, had violated regulations of the National Football League Players Association regarding agents. Since Harmon was a junior at the University of Iowa, signing a contract and accepting money from the agents violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. Culver's 30-page decision held that Harmon must repay only $5,869.47 of the $54,924.42 that Walter gave him in cash, airline tickets and an automobile. Culver, however, said that he did not consider Harmon to be an innocent party in the dealings with the agents and reprimanded the running back, who was the top draft pick of the Buffalo Bills in 1986. . . . The arbitrator's ruling also said that Ron's brother, Kevin Harmon, a senior running back who leads Iowa in rushing yardage this season, had also received gifts from the agents.

us,Ginsburg's Legal Philosophy,"Following are answers by Douglas H. Ginsburg to two of the questions posed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with his nomination last year to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia: Judicial Activism Q. Please discuss your views on the following criticism involving ''judicial activism.'' . . . A. In my view, the only appropriate function of the Federal judiciary is to resolve cases and controversies, as authorized by Article III of the United States Constitution. The Courts have no authority to engage in ''problem-solving'' apart from the resolution of such cases and controversies. While I do not think there is any wholesale tendency by the judiciary in recent years to ignore the ''case or controversy'' requirement, the Courts do seem to have relaxed such jurisdictional and prudential requirements as standing (and perhaps ripeness); narrowed the range of the ''political question'' doctrine, by which the Courts have historically avoided the resolution of controversies properly resolved by the political branches; and used their remedial powers in ways that constrain the legitimate roles of the legislative and executive branches. These tendencies may accot.for some of the recent controversy surrounding the role of the Federal Courts in our system of government. When the standing and ripeness requirements are loosened too much, the Courts are in danger of entertaining mere grievances rather than actual cases or controversies. When the political question doctrine is narrowed too much, or the Courts order legislatures to appropriate and executives to expend monies in particular ways, they are in danger of resolving issues that, in a democratic government, should be resolved through the democratic political process established by the Constitution.",1987-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1987","THE MARKETS The stock market continued to slump in another session marked by wide price swings. Selling by institutions helped drag down share prices, analysts said, but there were indications that some stability may be returning. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 50 points early in the day, then rose as much as 17 points above Tuesday's close, but ended down 18.24 points, or 0.93 percent, at 1,945.29. [ Page D1. ] The dollar continued its steady slide today, dropping to yet another record low of 135.35 yen in Tokyo. At one point, the dollar also sank through an important psychological barrier of 1.70 West German marks. The dollar's tumble persisted despite determined attempts to prop it up by the Bank of Japan. According to Japanese news reports, the bank purchased $200 million within just the first 30 minutes of trading today. [ D1. ] The dollar moved lower yesterday in seesaw trading on world markets. [ D20. ] President Reagan appointed four executives, each apparently selected to represent a different sector of the investment community, to his task force to assess the turmoil in the financial markets. The selection process had apparently been the subject of fierce lobbying by rival factions in the financial community and among regulators. [ D7. ] Index futures trading played a role in the recent collapse of the stock market, the S.E.C. chairman told a Senate committee. [ D7. ] Program trading is on the rise again, partly because the Big Board has lifted some of its curbs, and partly because traders have learned to compensate for the continued ban on automatic execution of stocks through the exchange's computers. [ D6. ] The Administration is devising a plan to rescue specialist brokers should the market plunge again, a senior Treasury official said. In an emergency, Wall Street firms and large corporations would be asked to contribute to a pot of $2 billion to $3 billion. [ D7. ] The bond market ended on a cautious note after the Treasury announced the results of the $9.25 billion, 10-year note auction, showing that demand for the issue was not as strong as expected. Prices for Treasury notes and bonds rose, but dealers said investors were not buying with the same urgency as they had late last month. [ D19. ] Yields on certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds were down for the week. Bank money market accounts were unchanged. [ D21. ] Platinum futures prices plunged the daily limit on expectations of an economic slowdown, and oil futures fell sharply. [ D20. ] COMPANIES American auto makers reported strong sales in the days following the market's collapse. Buyers appeared were undeterred by the stock market's 508-point plunge on Oct. 19 and the subsequent turmoil, as sales of cars and light trucks were up 10.8 percent from the year-ago period. But analysts said many sales had been in the pipeline before the stock market fell and they predicted sales would decline in coming months, possibly as early as in the next 10-day period. [ D1. ] G.M. will indefinitely close its assembly plant in Framingham, Mass., and lay off 3,700 workers because of slow sales of the Chevrolet Celebrity and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera. [ D4. ] I.B.M. predicted a return to 20 percent operating margins, the strongest indication yet that it believes its three-year slump is ending. John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, gave no timetable for when I.B.M. would reach its goal in a briefing to analysts. [ D1. ] Bell Atlantic came of age, becoming the first of the regional phone companies to report profits from its nonregulated businesses. Bell Atlantic said its enterprises, which include cellular telephones and financial services, earned $29 million on revenues of $643 million in the first nine months of the year. [ D4. ] INTERNATIONAL President Reagan lifted some trade sanctions against Japan that were imposed in April after the Administration accused Japan of failing to comply with an agreement on semiconductors. [ D5. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The English channel tunnel project moved forward as the company behind it signed an $8.75 billion loan package put together by 198 banks. But there's a catch. The money will not be disbursed unless the company raises an additional $1.3 billion from an equity offering. Talking Deals. [ D2. ] Analysts' earnings forecasts have not been reduced for many companies following the stock market's tumble and some people are surprised. Market Place. [ D8. ]",1987-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CHELSEA TRATTORIA ITALIANA, #108 Eighth Avenue, at 16th Street (924-7786) - **(Aug. 7, 1987) This trattoria serves some stellar pastas at affordable prices. Specials include terrific whole-wheat-flour-and-spinach ravioli, called cappelletti, filled with minced vegetables in a fresh tomato puree, and aromatic linguine with pesto sauce and tender young string beans. For desserts, try the orange layer cake. Entrees $10 to $21. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11:30 P.M. DIECI X, #1568 First Avenue, at 82d Street (628-6565) - **(July 18, 1986) This is a swanky East Side restaurant offering urbane Italian ambiance. Seafood is fresh and prepared with care, such as an appetizer of sauteed jumbo shrimp. Veal comes in several forms, notably a breaded paillard topped with a zesty salad. For dessert, it would be difficult to find a better tiramisu, this one an espresso-soaked vanilla cake that is pumped up with custard and mascarpone cheese. Entrees $13.95 to $24.95. Fridays and Saturdays, 5:30 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 5 to 10 P.M. MARCELLO, #1354 First Avenue, at 73d Street (744-4400) - **(Feb. 7, 1986) A contemporary dining room done in shades of beige and rose. An unusual Sardinian pasta called malloreddus alla Sarda is a gnocchi-like version sauteed with fresh herbs, tomato and sausage. The chef respects good quality veal, as in his veal Milanese. Don't miss the tiramisu for dessert. Entrees $12 to $19.50. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 10:30 P.M. PRIMOLA, #1226 Second Avenue, at 65th Street (758-1775) - **(Feb. 20, 1987) While the setting is somewhat spare, the food is skillfully prepared and vividly seasoned. An outstanding appetizer is good lean carpaccio of beef with well-aged Parmesan. Spinach gnocchi are resilient under a gratineed mozzarella and tomato sauce. First-rate entrees include sauteed veal with wild mushrooms. For dessert, try the ricotta cheesecake. Entrees $11.50 to $20.50. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays and Sundays, 5 P.M. to midnight. TOSCANA RISTORANTE, #200 East 54th Street (371-8144) - **(Sept. 4, 1987) This establishment is worth a detour both for its evocative design and for the food, some of which is outstanding. A dependable appetizer is the vitello tonnato, cold veal under a refined tuna and anchovy sauce. A luxurious dish is the thin zucchini-and-arugula-filled ravioli. A recommended entreeis filet mignon with a brassy mustard-and-scallion sauce. You might punctuate the meal with an exemplary creme caramel. Entrees $18 to $24. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 10:30 P.M.; Saturdays 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. What the stars mean, page C28.",1987-11-06T05:00:00+0000

The film blossoms into pastels when Mike arrives in a place where the decor is inviting, the scenery can be changed at will, and one's full potential can be realized in a wink.

The concluding volume of John Jakes's North and South trilogy takes place in the years immediately following the Civil War. Once again, the story centers on two families, the Hazards of Pennsylvania and the Mains of South Carolina, who become embroiled in the bitter social and political disputes of Reconstruction. By and large, the Hazards prosper: George returns to the family ironmongering business and his brother Stanley rises within the Republican Party while profiting financially from the ruin of the Confederacy. The Mains, who fought on the losing side, find life more difficult. Orry Main's widow, Madeline, struggles to save the family plantation while combating racial prejudice and the enmity of her brother-in-law Cooper. Devastated by the death of Augusta, the mother of his son, Charles Main journeys west, where he joins in the army's war against the Indians. Meanwhile, his estranged sister, Ashton, now a prostitute in Santa Fe, dreams of wreaking revenge on her family. As usual, Mr. Jakes sets this fictional action against a meticulously detailed historical backdrop. Although his characters are not as vivid as his storytelling, his portrait of a divided, demoralized nation, inflamed with hatred, still emerges as an enjoyable work of popular historical fiction.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Frank Whittle, the Englishman who fathered the jet engine, is to airplanes as Robert Fulton was to ships: he made them less glamorous but a lot faster and more reliable. Born in Coventry in 1907 to a working-class family, he joined the Royal Air Force at the age of 16 in the hope of bettering his prospects. The R.A.F. made him an officer, then sent him to Cambridge, where he took a splendid degree in engineering. As early as 1928 he had proposed the propellerless gas turbine - the jet - as a power source for faster planes, and throughout the 1930's continued to propose it, without, it seems, nearly enough encouragement from official sources. By 1937, however, a hand-made Whittle jet was running on a test stand and in 1941 - already too late to affect the course of World War II - a British experimental jet airplane made its first flight (the Americans were quick to see the point, borrowed an engine and some engineers, and from a standing start had their first jet aloft in a year and a day). The Germans, meanwhile, produced inferior but functional jet engines in time to cause some trouble before war's end. ''Whittle: The True Story'' may well be true, but it's all Sir Frank's truth. Old scores against various fuddy-duddies who obstructed him are settled with such rough justice as this: ''Why then did Griffith . . . damn the project? Sheer incompetence. . . ? Professional jealousy? Intellectual dishonesty? Or a combination of these things? We shall never know!'' John Golley, a journalist who has written several aviation books, is presumably responsible for the prose, not the facts. He weaves a dazzling garland of cliches and extinct metaphors; whenever the handwriting is on the wall, it isn't far from the frying pan to the fire. ''Having had the thumbs down from those in high places and the door slammed in his face, Whittle was at the cross-roads and didn't quite know what to do next.'' That sentence ought to be exhibited at county fairs.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Learning The Facts of Life,"RON MOGLIA wants every 5-year-old in America to play the ''birthing game.'' It goes like this: A kindergarten class chooses a girl to be the ''adult mommy'' and a boy to be the ''adult daddy.'' The teacher asks the ''adult mommy'' when she wants to have her baby - before lunch, before recess or before going home. When the big moment arrives, the mommy stands by a plastic tube labeled ''mommy's birthing tunnel'' and starts a classmate, who has been designated ''baby'' of the day, on his or her crawl through. As the baby emerges from the end of the tunnel labeled ''mommy's vagina,'' a ''doctor'' and a ''nurse'' welcome the baby into the world. They weigh the child and tell the class whether it's a boy or a girl. Then everyone runs off for milk and cookies. Fifteen years ago, the ''birthing game'' would have been unthinkable. Now, with disturbingly high teen-age pregnancy rates, the AIDS epidemic and widespread fears about other sexually transmitted diseases, many public-school educators believe that sex education is a must. Some experts - including Mr. Moglia, director of the Human Sexuality Program in the Department of Health Education at New York University, and Mary S. Calderone, a co-founder of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States - argue that the earlier sex education begins, the better. Sandra Ludlow, executive director of E.T.R. Associates, a California consulting group that has helped more than 300 school districts plan sex-education programs, agrees.

us,FICTION,"BLACK SWAN. By Christopher Hope. Illustrated by Gillian Barlow. (Harper & Row, $10.95.) This moving, lyrical novel, the author's fourth, is set in South Africa in 1965. Its hero, 17-year-old Lucky, is an idiot savant who lives with his adoptive grandmother in a black township. The boy is able to mimic perfectly the voices and manners of movie and radio personalities, but defies all outside attempts to pull him out of his dream world. Ilse, a sensitive young German woman who has become completely disillusioned with her native land after seeing her father at a Nazi reunion dinner, comes to South Africa to work with disturbed adolescents. Deciding that the way to reach Lucky is to enter his dreams, Ilse shows him a film of ''Swan Lake.'' Lucky is enchanted with the ballet, and the story of Lucky and Ilse becomes that of Prince Siegfried and Odette, with the wicked sorcerer taking the form of the South African authorities. The sympathies of the author, who was born in Johannesburg and now lives in London, clearly lie with the blacks, but the novel avoids romanticizing the oppressed. Instead, it shows that a brutal system quite often leads to a brutal response: after a screening of ''Swan Lake'' at the Bantu Men's Social Center, the dissatisfied audience rips the film from the projector, sets it on fire and tries to throw Lucky into the flames; Comrade Joe, a rebel leader whom Lucky joins after he and Ilse are forced to part, is merciless in executing deserters. Through such scenes, this spare 90-page tale in the Harper Short Novel series is deftly transformed from the story of a detached and overwhelmed young man into a remarkable parable of a cruel state.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

When should they learn it? Who should be forced to teach it? In the murky world of sex, good teachers are hard to find. The willing and the able are usually not the same people. Arguments go on constantly over who should do the honors. Educators accuse parents of neglecting their duties; parents accuse educators of much the same thing.

us,FICTION,"TALKING TO STRANGE MEN. By Ruth Rendell. (Pantheon, $16.95.) ''They are just like schoolboys,'' observes Mungo Cameron's father as he watches a televised report on a spy trial. ''Like so many schoolchildren playing games.'' But what this staid English doctor doesn't know is that the youngest of his children, teen-aged Mungo, is busily proving the truth - and the dangerous consequences - of that statement. For Mungo is the leader of a league of public school boys whose game-playing has steadily moved from a simple stunt concocted by two friends to an intricate mock war of secret messages, safe houses and elaborately planned maneuvers against their rivals. To Mungo and his cohorts, all this is still an innocent, albeit very serious hobby. But when a lonely garden-shop manager stumbles on one of their drop points and diverts himself from his failed marriage by trying to break their codes, a more ominous chain of events is set in motion. Thus one of England's most subtle practitioners of psychological suspense splices the movements of what the gardener believes to be a ring of drug smugglers into the schemes of a random sampling of adults who themselves may be much more - or less - than they appear. Is one of them responsible for a long-unsolved murder? Is one the child molester who has cautious parents like Mungo's warning their offspring against talking to strange men? As the answers are discovered, one character will be led to a bizarre confession, another to an attempt at suicide - and a third to an unwitting act of arson and a quite deliberate killing. Boys will be boys, after all. And innocence, at any age, can be just as destructive as experience.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Polls produced mixed, somewhat puzzling responses, but none of them seemed to portend a widespread movement to swear off spending. A similar reading emerged from the sales indicators. Auto sales came in with a surprising 10.8 percent gain for the last 10 days of October. Car buying was under close scrutiny for signs that customers would avoid big purchases after the market's tumble on Oct. 19. The more cautious analysts, however, said that many of the purchases were probably in the works before the big Wall Street selloff. On the other hand, sales at the big retailers also held up in October, even after the 19th. The figures were not generally robust, but that continues a months-long anemic trend. Gains ranged from 1 percent at Sears to 40 percent at Wal-Mart.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Maybe the American occupation at the end of World War II wasn't a prize. But it began a political and social revolution that made Japan the economic power it is today. John Toland's second novel is about Japan's redemption and rebirth under the occupation. Mr. Toland, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, turned to fiction in 1985 with ''Gods of War,'' which presented the conflict in the Pacific through the lives of two families, the McGlynns of America and the Todas of Japan. ''Occupation,'' a Rube Goldberg contraption of fact and fiction, picks up the families at the end of the war. There are 42 historical characters and 40 fictional ones (the ubiquitous McGlynns especially strain the imagination). Unfortunately, the facts are more fascinating than the fiction. But it may even be worth plodding through the book just for the portrait of Admiral Tojo, who goes contentedly to the gallows, giving up his life for the rebirth of his country: ''It is time for farewell,'' he declares, ''I shall wait beneath the moss, / Until the flowers are fragrant again.''

Although there are a number of masterly works by great composers, most music for winds has been written by players who regarded themselves primarily as performers and composed only to provide themselves with something to play. Equally popular was (and is) the practice of taking works composed for other instruments and arranging them for winds.

us,Deco and Decadence,"Today, the stylized, sleekly androgynous Art Deco portraits that the Polish-born artist Tamara de Lempicka painted and exhibited in Paris during the 1920's and 30's exist primarily as period pieces. They don't hold a candle to the era's great paintings nor to Art Deco's major achievement - which occurred largely in the area of design. But they do capture much of the decadent narcissism found in certain quarters of European society as the world slid from one war to another. Furthermore, these paintings are of a piece with their creator's Garboesque looks, unwavering self-absorption and a sensational style of life that included suits by Chanel, a studio by Mallet-Stevens and numerous affairs with members of both sexes, among them a rather sordid if unconsummated encounter with d'Annunzio. This of course is the stuff of television movies, and PASSION BY DESIGN: The Art and Times of Tamara de Lempicka (Abbeville Press, $29.95), as told by the artist's daughter, Baroness Kizette de Lempicka-Foxhall to Charles Phillips, a freelance writer, seems created with television in mind. Chapters often end with freeze-frame flourishes that make you think of Joan Collins's Alexis: ''She simply was not a woman to go for long unnoticed.'' ''From the start, she banked on style.'' De Lempicka's two husbands and daughter remain shadowy figures; her place in the Parisian art scene is never seriously broached. Only the artist's insatiable ambition and the misery it seems to have caused her and those around her, give this book its reality. As for the paintings, usually reproduced here in full color, they suffer by comparison with the high-style movie star photos of the artist herself, suggesting that the kind of hothouse, artificial beauty she sought was better captured by the photographers of the time.",1987-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Edberg, ranked second in the world, needed almost three hours to win the final. It was his seventh Grand Prix singles crown of the year, more than any other player.

us,Q&A,"Q.The shingles on our house are dark and weather-beaten. We are uncertain as to how to paint them and how often to do it. Can you help? A.Assuming they are wood shingles or shakes, they should be stained or treated with a clear wood preservative. Using a paint on shingles almost always results in peeling and flaking. True stains (not the so-called heavy-bodied stains that are really opaque paints) cannot peel or flake. And because of the pigment they contain, stains provide more protection against discoloration than do clear sealers or preservatives. They need to be renewed every four to eight years, depending on how the stain weathers. Q.I want to paint the aluminum siding on my house. What is the best way to remove the powdery buildup on the surface, and is there a special type of paint I should use? A.The powdery residue can be scrubbed off with a strong detergent and water, or you can use a high-pressure washer. Several companies make a latex house paint that is designed for use on aluminum siding, but many regular latex house paints can also be used. Read the label to make sure that the paint is suitable. Where powdering is severe, a special primer or sealer may be recommended for the first coat. Q.My table leaves were stored in a damp spot and as a result they have warped. Can this be corrected -perhaps by applying a damp covering and putting weights on top? A.In some cases this technique works, but usually mild heat is also required. Lay the leaves on a stack of wet towels or burlap near a source of mild heat (a radiator or wood stove) with the concave side facing up. Then apply weights on each end. This usually requires several days and the towels will have to be remoistened periodically.",1987-11-12T05:00:00+0000

People by the hundreds danced, dined, drank, talked, reminisced. The staff got to forget what day it was, and virtually every foreign artist who has ever shown at the Guggenheim flew in to pay tribute to Thomas M. Messer, who last week announced his retirement after 27 years as director of the museum. (His fief also extended, in recent years, to the Peggy Guggenheim collection in Venice.) They got to see some great art, too. It would be hard to find more compelling works of their kind and date than Roy Lichtenstein's ''Preparedness'' (1968), Giacometti's ''Nose'' (1947), Brancusi's ''Muse'' (1912) and Neil Jenney's ever more pertinent ''Media and Man'' (1969). From earlier days, there were paintings and drawings in profusion by Cezanne, Pissarro, Seurat, van Gogh, Gauguin and the Douanier Rousseau.

Did you know that Teddy Roosevelt actually said ''Great Scott!'' more often than ''Bully!''? Or that Eleanor Roosevelt caught the corsage at her cousin Alice's wedding? Or that Alice considered wearing white and red gowns to her coming-out party before settling on blue?

Volkov, a qualifier and ranked 116th in the world, matched Lendl early, , often dominating the rallies. But he lost his serve in the ninth game and one chance was all that Lendl needed. (AP) Bunge Loses in Upset: Leila Meskhi of the Soviet Union, ranked 66th in the world, defeated seventh-seeded Bettina Bunge of Switzerland, 6-4, 6-2, in a second-round match at the $150,000 Virginia Slims of Chicago tournament. In today's quarterfinals, Meskhi will meet third-seeded Helena Sukova, who struggled to victory in her second-round match against a fellow Czechoslovak Jana Novotna, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Sixth-seeded Lori McNeil of Houston eliminated Etsuko Inoue of Japan, 6-2, 1-6, 6-1. (AP) Squash Khan to Face Dittmar: Jansher Khan of Pakistan, the World Open champion, scored a fourth straight victory over his countryman Jahangir Khan last night to move into today's final of the $50,000 Rolex United States Open at The Palladium in Manhattan. The 18-year-old Jansher simply wore down Jahangir, who was playing on a sore right leg, and prevailed, 17-16, 8-15, 4-15, 15-10, 15-4. Johnsher's opponent in the final will be fourth-seeded Chris Dittmar of Australia, who ousted Ross Norman of New Zealand, 15-11, 15-7, 15-3. Boxing Reid Topples Hines: Chris Reid of Little Silver, N.J., the International Boxing Federation's 12th-ranked light heavyweight, recorded his 17th knockout by stopping Irvin Hines at 2:27 of the fourth round of a scheduled 10-round bout last night at the Felt Forum. In the fourth, Reid knocked Hines down with a right to the head. Hines took the mandatory 8 count from Referee Luis Rivera. With another right to the head , Reid (18-1-1) knocked Hines (17-14-1) to his knees to end the fight. Golf Bean Leads in Hawaii: Andy Bean, the defending champion, shot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to take a three-stroke lead after the second round of the Kapalua International in Kapalua, Hawaii. ''I feel like it's January and I'm just starting the season,'' said Bean, who missed most of the year with an elbow injury. He has completed 36 holes without a bogey. Bean reached the halfway point in a tournament-record 131, 13 under par on the Bay course at the Hawaiian resort. The leader after the first round, Sandy Lyle of Scotland, a previous winner of this title, was tied for second with Lanny Wadkins at 134. .(AP)",1987-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Placing the blame precisely is not easy, simply because there is so much blame to go around. However, let us start with Richard Bonynge, who conducted lifelessly, apparently concerned with little more than keeping the orchestra down. That expedient did allow the famous voice of Joan Sutherland, his wife and the evening's Leonora, to be clearly heard.

Giamatti said one half of a 15-page report that will be sent to clubs in the National League next week was devoted to the problem. ''At the heart of it, I think, is alcohol management,'' he said, aligning himself with those who have called for alcohol-free seating at baseball and other sporting events.

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. ALO ALO, 1030 Third Avenue, at 61st Street (838-4343) - **(June 21, 1985) The whimsically chic dining room resembles a grand cafe. The chef's spirited style is modern yet not affected. An unusual antipasto is a warm salad of smoked buffalo mozzarella, sun-dried and fresh tomatoes, red and yellow roasted peppers, red onions and fresh thyme. A star among the pastas is fusilli with broccoli and pancetta. A standout fish dish is steamed salmon on a bed of steamed yellow squash and tomatoes, served with a tomato coulis. Pastas $10.50 to $15 and entrees $15 to $21. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 2 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 2 P.M. ARQUA, 281 Church Street (334-1888) - **(April 24, 1987) This airy and minimalist restaurant is named after a village in northeastern Italy. An unusual appetizer is fresh fillets of sardines pickled with sweet and sour onions. The trinity of northern Italian cuisine - gnocchi, risotto and polenta - is beautifully executed here. The feathery gnocchi are usually bathed in some variation of light tomato sauce. Polenta is creamy and lusty, blended with sausage and wild mushrooms. An enticing entree is roasted baby pheasants served with champagne grapes. For dessert, the ricotta cheesecake has a lively lemony touch. Entrees $15 to $22. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 11:30 P.M. CONTRAPUNTO, 200 East 60th Street (751-8616) - *(Nov. 23, 1984) This restaurant, while limited in scope, puts considerable energy and imagination into making its pastas truly distinctive. Try the capelli marina piccola, strands of al dente angel hair pasta flecked with dried tomatoes, shallots, leeks and basil, all crowned with little neck clams. For seafood lovers, there is also ravioli stuffed with lobster and scallops or crabmeat. All the appetizers, which include air-dried beef with Parmesan cheese, are good. For dessert, the best choice is a homemade sorbet. Pastas $11.75 to $15.75. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to midnight; Sundays, 4 P.M. to midnight. ORSO, 322 West 46th Street (489-7212) - **(July 18, 1986) This is a sunny and casual Italian restaurant in clean tans and oak. The menu changes daily, but one can usually find the delicious salt-crusted grilled shrimp served in the shell - the sweet meat is heady with smoky nuances. Pizzas have thin, yeasty crusts and vibrant toppings: Gorgonzola, prosciutto, onion and garlic; sausage, mozzarella, garlic and tomato. Succulent little grilled quails with a light sauce are stellar; so, too, is a rolled veal tenderloin stuffed with spinach and mildly tart goat cheese. Among the desserts is a semolina pudding with strawberry sauce. Entrees $12 to $19. Fridays and Sundays, noon to 11:45 P.M.; Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 11:45 P.M. UNION SQUARE CAFE, 21 East 16th Street (243-4020) - **(Jan. 24, 1986) The main dining room is characterized by simple rustic touches, kind lighting and well-spaced tables. The food is genuine and eclectic. A light way to begin is with pappardelle of zucchini, thin flat strips of zucchini in a fresh tomato sauce flecked with garlic and shallots. The most unusual dish on the menu is the marinated fillet mignon of tuna, a whale-size slab of florid tuna seared on the outside and progressively rare toward the center. A confetti of ginger shavings adds a vibrant dimension. For dessert, there is a semifreddo bianconero, a frozen mousse of dark and white chocolate with chocolate chips in an espresso cream sauce. Entrees $17 to $22. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to midnight. What the stars mean, page C24.",1987-11-13T05:00:00+0000

It would oblige Managua's rebel opponents to surrender their weapons after one month and accept a political amnesty. Page 1 News analysis: Boris Yeltsin's ouster has raised questions about the Soviet leader as he prepares for his first visit to the United States. Mr. Yelstin was once regarded as one of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest political supporters. 1 U.S. policy toward Moscow will not be influenced by internal maneuvering in the Soviet leadership, officials said. They are emphatic that it would be a mistake to tailor policy to try to bolster the Soviet leader. 6 Tariffs against imports from Brazil totaling more than $100 million will be imposed, President Reagan said. The punitive action is aimed at a Brazilian requirement effectively barring foreign participation in their computer market. 1 West German and French leaders concluded a two-day meeting with agreements to jointly develop a combat helicopter and to set up joint councils on military and economic policy. 3 In the Iran-Contra investigation, seven House Democrats on the Con-gressional committees will attach a statement to the panels' report disagreeing with its conclusion that theWhite House was fully cooperative with the inquiry. 3 Iraq restored relations with Egypt, the official Iraqi press agency reported. The agency said both countries would nominate ambassadors immediately. Links were severed after Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. 7 Arsonists and looters in Bangladesh will be shot on sight, President H. Ershad declared after days of sporadic unrest in several cities. ''We are not going to tolerate any more of this nonsense,'' he said. 28 U.N. body calls for widening of test ban treaty 3 Buenos Aires journal: Timerman in strange lands 4 Chinese dissident said to die in jail 5 Alexandria recovering its Arab soul 7 NATIONAL 8-9, 35-36 Consumers are still spending freely, seemingly unworried by the stock-market plunge that began in mid-October, the Government's monthly report on retail sales indicates. 1 Beech-Nut sold phony apple juice intended for babies from December 1981 to March 1983. The Beech-Nut Nutrition Corporation pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that it violated the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act through the sales. 1 Scientists repaired crushed nerves connecting the extremities to the spinal cord in mammals for the first time, they reported. The research is pointing the way toward treatment of what are now intractable neurological problems. 1 Charges of parental sexual abuse are made in thousands of cases every year across all class lines. The dispute over one girl could almost be an object lesson in how convoluted such cases can become. 1 The budget talks got back on track as negotiators set aside disagreements and began to consider ways to delay the automatic spending cuts that are to take effect next Friday. 9 A compromise military budget that cuts sharply into several weapon programs was approved by Congressional negotiators. The bill sets priorities indicating which military programs will be cut, but it does not set a final spending total. 9 A partisan fight in Florida is deepening. The state Legislature and the Governor continue to be mired in a battle over the state's 5 percent tax on services and bogged down even more on medical malpractice insurance. 35 George Bush and Pat Robertson prepared for a showdown in a straw poll of Florida Republicans by staking out positions designed to minimize possible setbacks. About 2,500 delegates will vote at the state Republican convention. 35 Reagan papers find a home 8 Exclusionary club may pose problems for Judge Kennedy 8 Ginsburg role in cable television case under scrutiny 9 Escape tests set on space shuttle 9 Coal miners open labor talks 9 Shake-up expected in Dole campaign 35 Dupont and Bush taking off gloves 35 Dukakis release personal records 35 Jackson adds 2 officials to campaign 35 REGIONAL 29-32, 34 A new state investigative agency to combat ''systemic corrupution'' and racketeering in New York City's construction business was called for by Governor Cuomo as part of a campaign to clean up the industry. 1 Leading experts on homicide are meeting for three days in Albany to swap stories, talking of knives and cyanide and killings in the night. In other words, they have been having a wonderful time. 29 The release of a homeless woman was temporarily barred by a New York State appellate court. The woman, Joyce Brown, was the first person hospitalized under a plan to remove disturbed homeless people from the streets. 29 The judge in the Joyce Brown case has long been known for his interests in housing for the poor. Acting Justice Robert D. Lippmann ruled Thursday that the homeless woman should be allowed to return to a life on the streets. 30 No damage seen to homeless plan 30 Lisa Steinberg's violent death has left parents of her schoolmates with differences over the questions it raised. The parents have struggled to find ways to explain the girl's death to their children. 29 A radar search for a bed of a brook was conducted in Washington Square Park by two geology professors and a graduate student. By using the radar equipment, the team could search for the underground brook without moving so much as a pebble. 29 A Connecticut woman was murdered in August after her 16-year-old daughter ''begged'' her boyfriend to do the killing and they discussed several nights on which to do it, according to an arrest warrant. 31 In the Howard Beach murder trial, an expert on the effects of drugs on human behavior testified that Michael Griffith had used cocaine too long before he died for it to have influenced his decision to run onto a highway. 31 Times Company and pressmen's union in tentative accord 31 Verdict set aside in mercury case 31 Officers and firefighters have history of ties 31",1987-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Williams had simply written a political thriller set in West Africa in the 1960's, then ''Jacob's Ladder'' might have emerged as a well-written genre novel featuring a number of sensitive evocations of landscape and mood. But Mr. Williams, a former journalist in Africa and the author of numerous books of fiction and nonfiction, has something to say about blacks who are caught between Africa and the West, and to get it across he has contrived a plot that never allows belief to settle in. Jake Henry, the son of black American missionaries, has been sent as a military attache to Pandemi, the African country where he spent his boyhood. As an agent of the United States, his mission is to destroy the nuclear reactor his long-lost friend Fasseke, now President of Pandemi, is about to unveil. But the African past begins to reach out and arouse Jake's deeply suppressed anger. Through this gradual awakening, which may or may not occur in time to enable Jake to thwart the C.I.A.'s plot, Mr. Williams introduces his basic message: that no matter how far a black goes in America he will never be respected and that his soul inevitably lingers among his brothers across the ocean. Most American thrillers have a right-wing bias without really acknowledging it. ''Jacob's Ladder'' belongs to the sentimental left, and is so persistent about its point that the story hits a roadblock at every turn: Halt for the meaning. But the themes of African independence and black identity are too important and too complex to be presented in such a fashion.",1987-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Among the basic questions they are asking are these: What pushes some people over the boundary from dissatisfaction and protest into terrorist activity? Is each terrorist group a case apart, or do they belong to common patterns? Are there things that can be done to identify people who are prone to terrorism and draw them away from the terrorist groups that encourage them?

For everyone else serious about writing or thinking, ''An Urchin in the Storm'' is nearly a perfect study in method. Mr. Gould, a paleontologist with a bent for the subtleties in arguments about nature and nurture and the intricacies of evolutionary theory, teaches at Harvard. He also writes about other people's writing the way it should be done. ''Each of these chapters,'' he says in a little preface that lays out his approach to knowledge, ''uses an individual book to pursue a general theme, but organizes its discussion as a critique of content.'' A chapter entitled ''Deep Time and Ceaseless Motion,'' a review of two works on geology, explores how facts and ideas commingle in creative science. A review of a biography of a Nobelist, Barbara McClintock, whose work led the way to modern molecular genetics, is about the ''initial rejection (or, more frustratingly, simple incomprehension) of great insights.'' And ''Exultation and Explanation,'' a review of two books by the ecologist G. E. Hutchinson, is about diversity and its limits. It is also a celebration of the richness of the world. Indefatigable in his determination to fight reductionism, Mr. Gould is proof of his own postulate in Chapter Three, ''Misserving Memory,'' a review of an attack on Darwin's originality: ''The analogy between childhood wonder and adult creativity is biology, not metaphor.''",1987-11-15T05:00:00+0000

This time, readers are led to war-torn Europe, where they witness the burgeoning friendship of two Americans, Sam Walker and Arthur Patterson, as well as the heady love affair between Sam and Solange Bertrand, an exquisite Frenchwoman. When the war ends, Sam and Solange marry. Their union, complete with three beautiful daughters, is a love for the ages - until Sam kills Solange in a jealous rage and commits suicide. This unhappy turn of events leaves his friend Arthur with the task of finding homes for the three orphan girls - Hilary, Alexandra and Megan. At first Arthur farms them out to their alcoholic aunt; then he separates the three girls, leaving each ignorant of her sisters' widely divergent fates. Hilary, the eldest, who remains with her aunt, endures all manner of indignity and abuse but holds onto the dream of one day finding her sisters. Ms. Steel's familiar themes of love and loss are here in abundance, along with exotic locales, expensive restaurants, titled Frenchmen, antique furniture and fresh flowers in every room. There's even the atypical addition of social awareness when baby Megan grows up to become a doctor in poverty-stricken Appalachia. As one might expect, Ms. Steel is on shaky ground here and quickly returns to the traumas she knows best: rape, incest, abortion and unfaithful husbands. Will Hilary find her grown-up sisters? Will Alexandra's titled husband abandon her once he knows the truth about her past? And what deep secret will forever alter Megan's life? The fun of ''Kaleidoscope'' lies in discovering the answers to these and other questions.

Reading Arthur Donovan's account of what it was like playing pro football in the 1950's is as close as most of us will ever get to sitting around a big-league locker room, opening a few cool ones and listening to the big guys talk about the legendary wars and warriors of the good old days, before million-dollar contracts, before the Super Bowl, when there was still at least one player (Chuck Bednarik) who played both ways, offense and defense, for 60 full minutes per game. It is a book full of nostalgia, some insights on how the great ones played the game, and how Mr. Donovan, a defensive tackle who weighed more than 300 pounds, thumped his way from the Bronx to the Baltimore Colts, for whom he made a key tackle against the New York Giants to help the Colts win (23-17) the 1958 championship game that is often called the greatest game ever played in the National Football League. The strength of the book is its honesty: Mr. Donovan admits he was flat on his back at another key point in the big game; that he despised Coach Weeb Ewbank; that he admires hard-drinking, violent men, although his father, a famous boxing referee, punched out a friend, who later died, in a drunken brawl. The story is told in locker-room expletives, conscientiously picked up by Mr. Donovan's co-author, Bob Drury, a reporter for New York Newsday and a former sports columnist for The New York Post. But there are many insider's nuggets: how Notre Dame Coach Frank Leahy pulled Mr. Donovan out of a sickbed to play; how, before face masks became widely used, Johnny Unitas would punch those about to tackle him; how the hated Ewbank froze up in a crisis. Mr. Donovan, a member of the game's Hall of Fame, does not at all pretend to be the thinking man's old pro. ''If Shula and Lombardi were generals,'' he says of those two great coaches, ''we wouldn't be worrying about the Soviet Union today. It would be part of the United States.''

Baker had been found dead in the passenger seat of his Mercedes with a bullet wound in his chest and four others from another gun in his head and neck. At the request of the police, so as not to jeopardize their investigation, I gave Baker the fictional name of ''Halfback'' in the article. As the story went to press, Cachie and his partner on the case, Detective Donald Gregori, had developed leads to the motive for the slaying: two bitter feuds Baker was conducting - one with a drug supplier, another with a man police believe to be a rival crack tycoon, Donny Smallwood (''Eddie Holmes'' in the original article).",1987-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,DON JUAN IN MANHATTAN,"Don Juan's a hero with a hundred faces: For some he's mostly Mozart, or Moliere. He shows up in a hundred different places, He's profligate, Byronic, debonair. He goes to Hell, so heavy his disgrace is, In ''Man and Superman'' we see him there - A daring Shavian variant on the pattern; So after that let's send him to Manhattan. Picture our hero, then - he wings his way With seat belt buckled, and with heart aglow. He's dreamed for years of this auspicious day, His first taste of the fabled land below. The wheels touch tarmac - this is JFK! The glittering gateway to earth's greatest show! And everything comes up to expectation (Save for the three-hour wait in Immigration). A courteous cabbie speeds him through the dusk. ''So this is Queens . . . And Brooklyn can't be far . . . I'll visit them. . . .'' Right now, though, it's crepusc- Ular, and he pursues a single star - The place that makes all others look subfusc, Manhattan! Vibrant as a Last Hurrah, An apple pie, oh my, reach for the sky borough, Whether approached by Queensboro Bridge or Triborough. He's whisked through shining streets, past flashing signs; Billboards and neon names whiz by pell-mell - David's Cookies, Dunkin' Donuts, Duncan Hines, Crazy Eddie, Kinney, Cartier, Carvel. At length, before he even wines or dines, He checks in at a far from small hotel - No wishing well, no trace of distant steeple, But lots and lots of people (we the people). He mingles with the throng: they're talking turkey, Cranberry, sweet potato, pumpkin pie. At first he's baffled, and it all seems murky, But gradually he grasps the reason why, And when he does, it makes him feel quite perky. He gazes on with an approving eye, And thinks, ''Unless I'm very much deceived, They're giving thanks for benefits received.'' ''Some annual celebration, I'll be bound. Well, they've got good reason for their gratitude. Signs of prosperity are all around, And signs of liberty (or even latitude). The patriotic claims they make are sound, It's not a case of pious platitude. They should all be grateful, every son and daughter -'' (Then a man came up and begged him for a quarter.) Let's skip a day or two - Juan's installed. He takes his ease, and saunters through the city, Amused, amazed, and (once or twice) appalled, And moved to admiration, or to pity. He learns exactly what each landmark's called, Acquires the facts, masters the nitty-gritty. He hunts for unicorns up at the Cloisters, And in Grand Central he consumes his oysters. He learns to tell a Tishman from a Tisch, The difference 'twixt New York and The New Yorker; He dines on pasta, egg foo yong and knish, Washed down with Stoli, sake, Johnny Walker; Reads novelists licked in shape by Gordon Lish; Tunes in to Donahue (a mighty talker); Lunches at Mortimer's with ageless ladies, And rides the subway (not as hot as Hades). The local citizens proclaim their views, For most of them are bold, and few seem shy. They make him offers that he can't refuse, They take his arm, they poke him in the eye, Update him on the news behind the news, Discuss their diets till he wants to die. They mostly welcome him with warmth and graciousness, But sometimes leave him smothered with loquaciousness. Winter draws on apace, the last leaves flutter - A time for Jets and Giants and skating rinks. Bag ladies search for treasures in the gutter, And proud possessors bundle up in minks. The city gleams, a gem fresh from the cutter (With here and there a flaw), and Juan thinks: ''The more I see, the more I like the look of it. I'll get to know each cranny and each nook of it.'' He wanders round the Village and TriBeCa, Inspecting every artwork and antique. He cuts through SoHo like a Black & Decker (To list its galleries would take a week). Zabar's, the West Side gourmet's mecca, Ungaro, Valentino, chic by chic, And streets where the most useful arts are martial - He tours them all, objective and impartial. He roams through Wall Street, home of trust and trader, Where some talk bull, some find it hard to bear; He marvels when he meets a corporate raider (Earth hath not anything to show more fair). It makes him feel as virtuous as Ralph Nader - Then he decides he'd rather like his share. He learns the market game, and how to play, And makes his money the new-fashioned way. And now the festive season's almost here, With constant exhortations to be jolly. The old familiar symptoms reappear - Sleigh bells and Hallmark cards and plastic holly. Bing Crosby's tones still ring out loud and clear; And, lest it all seem earthbound fun and folly, Each window sports a Christmas tree and/or a Branched candlestick (more rightly called ''menorah''). What of Don Juan? It must be confessed Our hero's really quite a worldly fellow. He sets out to enjoy himself with zest, Looks on the wine that's red (and also yellow). He's fond of clothes, too - nothing but the best: The thought of buying new ones makes him mellow. He's born to shop - it puts him in good humor: An unashamed conspicuous consumer. He spends his money like a drunken sailor, Buys toys from Schwarz, and sporting goods from Herman, While not content with purchasing a trailer He buys a car (the engineering's German). And in the full-length mirror at his tailor He gazes at himself like Cindy Sherman. He samples the delights of Fiorucci, Of Gucci, Pucci and of Grace Balducci. Of Broadway's magic oft has he been told, And owns himself a trifle disappointed. Perhaps it's only that he's growing old, Perhaps (oh wretched spite!) the time's disjointed. At any rate, he sits there good as gold Through plays by critical acclaim annointed, And sometimes laughs, or (when they're tragic) mourns, And sometimes yawns and yawns and yawns and yawns. It's Christmas - things speed to their appointed ends, It's a time of hope, and sugarplums as well, A time of strangers longing to be friends: Carols peal, and slowly fade, and anthems swell And die away. A final hush descends. A last bedraggled Santa clangs his bell. Presents are set down, waiting for first light; A last mouse stirs, and silent is the night. Soon it will be New Year. It's time to go. Up in his lonely room Don Juan packs, And takes one last look at the scene below, The whole great Babylonian ball of wax. City of boom or bust, of high and low, Of Bloomingdale's, and big brown bags, and Saks, Of servings that are almost too substantial And analysts (both psycho and financial). City of Mary Boone and Geoffrey Beene, Sondheim, and Suzy, and the Circle Line, Temple Emanu-El, Tavern on the Green, Calvin Tomkins, Calvin Trillin, Calvin Klein. City of Witter (not forgetting Dean), Of two Saul Steinbergs and of Andrew Stein, Of Rudolph Giuliani and Hizzoner, Of Dr. Ruth, and Cardinal O'Connor.

us,GIANTS OF THE ROD AND REEL,"Paul Schullery's history of American fly fishing, like the sport itself, is not for everyone. Primarily, it's for those who think that ''fly fishing is the best thing there is.'' It might also interest nonangling history buffs, who will be amazed to discover that fly fishing has given rise to as many competing schools of thought as the Weimar Republic. Fly fishing, which has attracted a disproportionate share of mystics and pedants since at least the 15th century, has its Great Men theorists, its divine rightists, its environmental and technological determinists, as well as its social, literary and institutional historians. In AMERICAN FLY FISHING: A History (Nick Lyons Books, $29.95) Mr. Schullery, former director of the American Museum of Fly Fishing, gives due respect to all schools of thought and even to other types of fishers, including ''worm drowners and hardware flingers.'' If he has a bias, it is toward fly fishing technology - the evolution of American rods, reels, lines and flies over the last 200 years. Words like genius, hero and giant are applied to the innovative rod builders and line makers who led ''the great tackle revolution of the late nineteenth century.'' Many of the book's historic photographs, prints and drawings illustrate this aspect of fly fishing. Readers will learn, for instance, that a good, oil-soaked, all-silk tapered line took six months to manufacture in the 1880's and required daily care if it were to last. The greater revelation is that, however newfangled our tackle may be, the issues that engage fly fishers' passions - the relative merits of strict imitationist versus impressionist fly tying, the bass/trout rivalry, the upstream/downstream debate, the what-you-cast versus how-you-cast approach to fishing - are as old as the nation.",1987-11-15T05:00:00+0000

''Breaking the Code'' is a work about a gay martyr that moves the audience precisely because its protagonist, as presented by Mr. Whitemore and as beautifully acted by Derek Jacobi, never thinks of himself as a martyr. When the story of a badgered nonconformist is told as a tale of proud self-assertion rather than maudlin self-pity, one finds not a saintly victim, but a stirring hero, at center stage.",1987-11-16T05:00:00+0000

The first prize of $75,000 increased the 27-year-old Lendl's earnings for 1987 to just short of $1 million. Lendl, who has been the world's top-ranked tennis player for two years, dropped only 17 points on his service, 5 in the first set, 4 in the second and 8 in the third. (AP) Navratilova Triumphs: Martina Navratilova was surprised that she was facing a 16-year-old from the Soviet Union in the championship of the $150,000 Virginia Slims of Chicago tournament. But it didn't shake her game. ''I was a little more creative from the baseline,'' Navratilova said after beating unseeded Natalya Zvereva, 6-1, 6-2, yesterday to capture her eighth Chicago title. Zvereva, speaking through her coach, Olga Morozova, said she didn't play her best. She was seeking to become the first Russian to win a tournament on the Virginia Slims circuit since Morozova defeated Billie Jean King in Philadelphia in March 1974.

Marsh, who started the final round four shots back, finished with a 276 total, 12 under par on the club's 7,072-yard, par-72 Gotemba course. He won $120,000. Watson, who started the final round one shot back, fired a 70 for 277. (AP) Soccer C. W. Post Advances: Jamal Hassan scored off a feed from Jimmy Posillico to give C. W.

A side view of the racquet shows a tapered midsection that bulges out in the middle to twice the size of a standard racquet. When seen head-on, it has a conventional shape. Marketed as the Profile, the racquet is made with high-grade graphite. It is designed to be extremely stiff but low in vibration. Zina Garrison of Houston, ranked among the top 10 in women's tennis, has tried the Profile. She sees it as a big help for players looking for more power in their stroke; for her, it is a matter of learning to harness the power. The racquet has alleviated her chronic arm problems, she said. The first shipments are due in tennis stores next month; quantities will be limited. It will be available in two head sizes (95- and 110-inch) and will retail for $225.",1987-11-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Major Decisions in Insider Trading Law,"Trading of securities by company executives based on inside information has been illegal throughout much of the history of corporate America. It was not until the 1960's that Federal authorities sought to broaden the notion of ''insider'' to include printers, financial analysts and journalists. Following are some of the major developments - before yesterday's Winans decision - in insider trading law. 1909: The United States Supreme Court establishes a rule that the director of a company must either disclose the inside information or abstain from trading. Although the case, Strong v. Repide, made it clear than an executive could not use privileged information for profit, it did not address the issue of who is an insider. 1934: Congress passes the Securities Exchange Act, which contains a key provision, Section 10, broadly outlawing certain forms of stock fraud. Based on Section 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1942 adopts Rule 10b-5 making the fraud provisions applicable to purchases as well as sales of securities. Section 10 and Rule 10b-5 become the key provisions to prosecute illegal insider trading. Neither provision actually defines insider trading. 1968: The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York rules that anyone who possesses inside information of a consequential nature must either disclose it to all of the investing public or abstain from trading until that information is public. Acting on a tip that the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company had discovered a site near Timmins, Ontario, rich with copper ore, company officials traded heavily in the stock before disclosing the find.",1987-11-17T05:00:00+0000

The injury to Larouche, who turned 32 Monday, is more serious than the originally diagnosed muscle strain and could mean a lengthy rehabilitation. The tests today are to create a treatment plan by determining the amount of pressure being exerted on the nerves and the extent of the damage to the disk. Conservative rehabilitation for injuries of this type include bed rest, traction and a mild exercise program. Surgery, including spinal fusion, is the radical treatment, but Dave Smith, the team trainer, said he did not anticipate that.

Exercise portion control. Eat half a slice, not half a pie, and let a little gravy go a long way. Remove as much fat from the gravy as possible. 2. To baste a turkey, use plain broth, apple juice or sherry, not butter or oil. 3. Use herbs freely, but stay the hand that shakes the salt. Avoid canned foods, which tend to be salty. 4. Serve raw vegetables instead of peanuts before a meal, to curb appetites in a nutritional way. 5. Do not add sugar, salt, marshmallows or butter to foods to make a glaze. Use light salad dressings, with a yogurt base, for example. 6. Serve fresh fruit for dessert. If you make cranberry relish from scratch using fresh berries and oranges, you can control the sugar content. 7. Stay away from bacon and sausage, which have a way of sneaking into holiday meals. 8. Make stuffings from whole-grain breads, and flavor them with fruits, fruit juices, herbs and vegetables. Moisten with stock, wine or other nonfat liquid.",1987-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Largent was hit by a Jet defender as he caught the ball and then, before his feet touched the ground, he lateraled to John L. Williams, who ran for an additional 14 yards. National Football League rules specify that a caught pass is not an official reception until the receiver's feet touch the ground. The play has now been officially recorded as a 26-yard pass from Krieg to Williams.

us,Q&A,"Q. We recently moved into a home that had carpet in the bathroom. This carpet was held down with double-faced tape that has left a gummy residue on the floor. I tried scrubbing this off with denatured alcohol, but it didn't work. Do you have any suggestions? A. This residue can almost always be removed by rubbing with a rag moistened with rubber-cement thinner (sold in art-supply and stationery stores), then with a dry cloth. If the floor is ceramic tile you can also use acetone, but this is much more volatile and more flammable (it will also remove paint). Another method that often works is heating the gummy residue with a hair dryer to soften it, then rubbing off with a dry cloth. Q. Our house, which was built in 1928, has front entrance steps and a front walk made of brick. Some of these bricks are flaking, leaving shallow depressions on the front of the brick, as well as on the top of some. I have tried filling in these depressions, but the filling pulls out after one or two winters. The rest of the mortar is in excellent condition and the bricks are not crumbling. Is there any way of refacing these bricks, short of replacing them? A. Chances are that no patch will really last for many years, but you would have a better chance for longer-lasting ones if you use a vinyl- or epoxy-fortified patching cement. These patching materials bond better in thin layers, so they will last longer. However, for a permanent cure you will probably have to replace the bricks. Q. The stucco on the back of our house has turned partly green behind one of our shrubs. I suspect this is from the sprinkler water that strikes both the shrub and the house wall. Is there any way to remove this green stain from the stucco? A. The discoloration is probably from the green leaves rubbing against the stucco when the wind is blowing, especially when the foliage is wet. Try scrubbing the stains off with a stiff brush dipped into detergent solution. If this won't remove them, try scrubbing with a bleach solution (one part bleach to five parts water). Be sure to test this first in a small corner as it will lighten the finish and may cause the washed spot to stand out.",1987-11-19T05:00:00+0000

The agreement still has to be go to Congress, and it encompasses estimates of savings that economists find exaggerated. 49 A major effort to reduce ozone by requiring changes in the gasoline sold in the warmer months will begin next summer in New York, New Jersey and six New England states. The changes would increase gasoline costs by 1.5 cents a gallon. 1 Volkswagen will close its U.S. plant by the fall of next year. The company said that the Pennsylvania plant had been losing money for five years because of sluggish sales and had little prospect of becoming profitable. 1 A capitalist-Marxist love feast of sorts was held in Washington, as the Soviet Ambassador honored Blanchette Rockefeller, the widow of John D.

After 15 years of marriage, Rachel Cowan converted to Judaism, her husband's religion, and she is now studying to be a rabbi. Paul Cowan, a reporter for The Village Voice, is the author of ''An Orphan in History,'' an exploration of his Jewish identity. Drawn from their own experience, cases from the intermarriage workshops they conduct and interviews, their book is a revealing look into the hearts, minds and souls of intermarried couples. The authors offer a historical perspective by examining previous generations of the interfaith families of Max Lerner and Ken Auletta, the political writers, as well as the relatives of the conflicted and never-married poet Emma Lazarus. In the present time, the Cowans address the emotional time bombs that erupt when an intermarried couple confronts their religious roots. The book probes the complexities of intermarriage with detail and candor, and many readers will recognize themselves in the stories. Of intermarriage in general, the Cowans assert, ''the Jewish community is preoccupied with it. The Christian world barely notices it.'' They explain that because of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, Jews feel a strong need to preserve their legacy, but go on to imply that gentiles don't feel as strongly as Jews about preserving their heritage. There is an imbalance of interviews in favor of converts to Judaism, and even the Cowans' reading list makes the argument that the gentile spouse in a mixed marriage should convert to Judaism. In a book that skillfully uses psychological insight to illuminate its subjects' motivations, one must question the underlying message of its one epigraph, preceding the chapter on children and intermarriage. A 4-year-old boy tells his friend, ''I'm half Jewish and half nothing.'' A highly perceptive examination of intermarriage, ''Mixed Blessings'' nevertheless sometimes seems to tell only half the story.",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

(Northeastern University, $49.95 until Jan. 1; $65 thereafter.) This is a volume for specialists in the life of Bernard Berenson, the renowned and recently much written-about art critic and business partner to the rapacious art dealer Joseph Duveen. The letters published here begin in 1887, when Berenson was a 22-year-old Harvard prodigy on his Grand Tour of Europe, writing back to his patron, the American heiress Mrs. Isabella Stewart Gardner, in Boston. The vast majority of the letters published are Berenson's; the longest and strongest are the early ones, when B.B., as he was known, fancied himself a writer. In tirelessly ingratiating and grandiloquent prose, he wrote of the books he was reading on his travels. Gradually, though, paintings caught his attention, and we see the transformation from struggling writer to professional connoisseur. Curiously, the letters most evocative of time and place are those written by Berenson's wife, Mary, during World War I, when she vividly and despairingly told of life in a deserted Florence, waiting out the ''tragic Manquake'' of the war. For his part, most of Berenson's passion shows up in his dogged pursuit of masterpieces for his patron. An altogether typical exchange between them goes: ''Dear Berenson, . . . Some day, by the way, you must say a little to me about that heart of yours. What does it do for you in this world?'' ''Dear Mrs. Gardner, . . . You ask me about my heart. It exists, but it is not to be written about. . . . Meanwhile a good bit of it throbs for your museum, and again I come with a proposition.''",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Given the fact that they are classic stories, some odd changes have been made in a few tales. In ''The Wild Swans,'' for instance, all 11 jackets are completed, so no brother is returned to manhood with one swan wing. Jack climbs the beanstalk, steals the bag of gold, and returns for the chicken and the harp, but there is no old woman who serves the giant and who hides Jack.

Bud Shrake's sixth novel, set at the time of the Vietminh assault on Dien Bien Phu in 1954, uses the early stages of the war in Southeast Asia as a backdrop for a gritty romantic adventure. Harry Sparrow, the central character, is a tough, hard-drinking American foreign correspondent. In quest of a Pulitzer Prize, he leaves the comfort of London and slips into Indochina just prior to the Communist onslaught. Mr. Shrake vividly re-creates both the entrenched French Army's frustration as it helplessly awaits the Vietminh attack and the carnage of the final battle. Harry escapes, along with Claudette, a nurse who is the daughter of a French Government official, and manages to file the best stories of his career. He also falls in love with Claudette. Back in London, Harry attempts to integrate his macho life style into the genteel domestic world of his new bride. But Claudette's mysterious connections with the Vietminh and with a German mercenary fighting in Indochina ultimately lead Harry and Claudette to the novel's quick-paced conclusion in Algeria, which is torn by its struggle for independence. Mr. Shrake renders the details of a reporter's life in the mid-50's with authenticity, and the action in the final scenes moves expediently if not always convincingly. Elsewhere, however, the story is clogged with turgid soliloquies on the relative merits of fascism and communism. In the end, though, ''Night Never Falls'' is illuminating on some aspects of the beginnings of the Vietnam conflict and often entertaining as an adventure tale - if one ignores Mr. Shrake's occasionally heavy-handed prose and gratuitous philosophizing.",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

The re-emergence of such a punk favorite should hardly come as a surprise, given the current interest in retro styles from the 1950's. But if you're looking for someone to pin it on, you might try the French designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, who has come out with his own version of the motorcycle jacket, reproportioned with more feminine lines.

None, including this one, has satisfactorily explained why the airliner strayed deep into Soviet airspace. David E. Pearson has, however, made a significant contribution to the controversy over the incident. Though his technical analyses are occasionally less than thorough, he has pulled together massive research and made some provocative revelations. More important, he has used the data to construct a compelling case for a Congressional inquiry. What makes his argument so compelling is the evidence of what the author says is a ''clear pattern of obfuscation in how the case was, and continues to be, presented to the public.'' He is talking about such things as: the Air Force action in letting radar records be automatically erased; discrepancies in tapes of conversations ostensibly between the plane and Japanese controllers; and the gag order imposed by a Federal judge on discussion of trial issues. (The book alludes briefly to a similar fogging of the Iran-contra affair.) Mr. Pearson, an expert on military affairs whose articles on the KAL flight have appeared in The Nation, believes it very unlikely that the penetration of Soviet airspace was just your average accident. He notes that the shootdown proved a bonanza for United States foreign policy, especially in overcoming objections to Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe. That could be reason enough for the Administration not to want the whole Korean 007 story told, whatever the merits of the missile policy. The author concludes that a government whose citizens acquiesce in silence about facts they have a right to know ''will be constantly tempted to act arbitrarily and in secret.''",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,PICTURES FROM A WOBBLY LIFE,"It's on the cover of Tony Mendoza's pictorial autobiography, STORIES (Atlantic Monthly Press, Paper, $6.95): a photo, which might pass as a snapshot if it weren't in formal black and white, of three women, up to their necks in water, wearing beach hats, all smiling. They're friendly. The caption, steaming with paranoia, reads ''Yeye's sisters, Magda, Tota, and Manana, used to make me nervous. Every time I saw them, they were always laughing. I was afraid to talk to them and run the risk of not being considered funny.'' Like all good autobiographers, Mr. Mendoza, a photographer of some renown, has constructed a persona. He's the outsider, a guy who uses his ''aw shucks'' naivete and alienation to con people into laughing. He does it by writing short, self-deprecating, seductive sentences, the verbal equivalent of his photographs. But there's a lot more going on here than deadpan family portraits, a big dog about to attack an ant and an alarm clock soon to be swimming in Boston Harbor. Mr. Mendoza, 46 years old, grew up in Cuba in a privileged family that got the boot from Fidel Castro. Suddenly, the photos become a document of exile, outsider culture, one which bumps into Mr. Mendoza's own wobbly flight into the second generation. He becomes an architect, gives it up to become a photographer, lives in a commune, doesn't marry until he's 45, tries to find commercial photography work. None of this pleases his businessman, Nixon-supporting father, who's in here, being examined by a doctor. The caption: ''My father has overeaten, overdrunk, and oversmoked for over 50 years. Whenever my mother warns him 'Miguel, you've had enough to drink!' he replies, 'Conchita, you want to live forever?' ''",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Winans supplied his associates with advance knowledge of his columns' contents and they traded securities based on that knowledge, making profits of $690,000. The Court said the trading violated statutes covering mail and wire fraud, but it deadlocked, 4-to-4, on whether securities laws were violated. Those convictions stand, but no precedent was established. That left some ambiguity about what constitutes insider trading, and the S.E.C. submitted to Congress a proposal to more precisely define the offense.

For years, football fanatics and non-football fanatics have said that Vince Lombardi, the legendary head coach of the once-great Green Bay Packers, was a godsend to the sport. His motto was ''Winning isn't the most important thing; it's the only thing'' and some have proclaimed that he was the personification of success. In his ''personal biography'' of the coach, Michael O'Brien says all this, but that is about all he says. Using interviews with almost anyone who may have known Lombardi, Mr. O'Brien, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin Center/ Fox Valley shows that Lombardi's diligence and his ''do-it-right'' ethic affected many people in a positive way. ''Vince'' also gives a satisfying look at Lombardi's personal history; he was proud but sometimes frustrated by his southern Italian heritage, and he rarely missed a Sunday Mass. Still, after eight years of researching Lombardi, with the help of the coach's family and the players he taught, Mr. O'Brien does not contribute a new understanding of a man whom some players and sportswriters refused to deify. ''Vince'' fails to examine any alternative insights into the ''play-to-win'' philosophy, or to provide a complete account of how this folk hero dealt with failure and frustration.",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

It is the patent of an invention that can scramble brains and destroy buildings by an ultrasound device. Then questions arise. Is this for real? Does it work as described?

The experts agreed that while man has been transforming the earth for centuries, the pace and scope of change have increased radically just in the last half century. They looked ahead as well; Paul Demeny of the Population Council presented projections that the world population would grow from 5 billion now to between 8 billion and 16 billion in the next century. The participants seemed concerned that such changes may be exceeding the ability of people and their institutions to adjust, but there was little consensus on what the changes meant or what could be done about them.

In Tony Hillerman's eighth mystery novel set among the mesas and arroyos of the Navajo Nation, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are faced with a multiple murder involving a strange mix of Indian witchcraft and modern medicine. Earlier this year, Newgate Callendar said here that the story is told ''in sensitive prose that once in a while approaches poetry.'' CITIES ON A HILL: A Journey Through Contemporary American Cultures, by Frances FitzGerald. (Touch-stone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) By examining four sub-cultures - the San Francisco homosexual community in the area known as the Castro, the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Baptist congregation in Lynchburg, Va., the Sun City retirement enclave in Florida and the Rajneeshpuram commune in Oregon - Frances FitzGerald explores the peculiarly American notion that it is possible to join with kindred souls and ''reinvent'' ourselves. Although our reviewer, Carl N. Degler, said last year that the links drawn among these communities were a little weak, he admired the book's ''lucid, often entertaining detail'' and ''evenhanded'' prose. THE FLAME BEARERS, by Kim Chernin. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $6.95.) Drawing on the kabbala and other sources of Jewish mysticism, Kim Chernin tells of Rae Shadmi, a successful academic who returns to San Francisco to take over the family business: a centuries-old cult run by women. By ''turning the rabbinic tradition inside out,'' Anne Roiphe said here last year, Ms. Chernin has created a novel that ''will be read with delight by those who enjoy good ideological revenge.'' THE BIG BOYS: Power and Position in American Business, by Ralph Nader and William Taylor. (Pantheon, $8.95.) Unlike much business journalism, these profiles of nine corporate leaders avoid celebrating the rich and powerful, our reviewer, Mark Singer, said in 1986. The authors ''have conducted their research in a tirelessly thorough manner, along the way cataloguing every discernible wart and scar.'' ULTRAMARINE, by Raymond Carver. (Vintage, $6.95.) Like his stark short stories, many of Raymond Carver's poems are about the silences that act like glass walls keeping people forever apart. ''He has the astonished, chastened voice of a person who has survived a wreck,'' Patricia Hampl said here earlier this year. No one else's ''brevity is as rich, as complete.'' END PAPERS: Essays, Letters, Articles of Faith, Workbook Notes, by Breyten Breytenbach. (McGraw-Hill, $8.95.) Many of the Afrikaaner poet and painter's musings on the tension between politics and art were written while he was in a South African prison because of his antiapartheid activities. In 1986, our reviewer, Bruce Robbins, said the author seemed to appreciate the ironies of being ''a prison-produced celebrity'' and has written ''an eloquent appeal for solidarity'' between blacks and whites in his homeland. RAT MAN OF PARIS, by Paul West. (Collier/Macmillan, $6.95.) Among the characters who have haunted the streets of Paris in recent years is the Rat Man, who would annoy tourists by flashing a live rodent in their faces. Lore Segal said here last year that in using this real-life eccentric as his subject, Paul West has written a novel whose prose is ''gorgeous and hilarious.'' TAKEOVER, by Moira Johnston. (Penguin, $7.95.) With the crash of the Dow, this account of Carl Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and the phenomenon of the involuntary merger may be more interesting historically than as a topic of current affairs. While our reviewer, Anthony M. Solomon, said last year that the book was not sufficiently analytical, it ''touches all the bases . . . and provides enough material for a generation of aspiring investment bankers to ponder.'' BLUEBEARD'S EGG: And Other Stories, by Margaret Atwood. (Fawcett, $4.95.) The most engaging pieces in this collection by the author of ''The Handmaid's Tale'' are those that seem the most autobiographical, Robert Towers said in The Book Review last year. ''In writing of [ her parents ] , the daughter allows herself to rise from time to time to a kind of visionary eloquence.'' WRITING IN RESTAURANTS, by David Mamet. (Penguin, $6.95.) In these essays, the playwright David Mamet, whose ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' won a Pulitzer Prize in 1984, wanted to show that ''the purpose of the play is to bring to the stage the life of the soul.'' Last year, our reviewer, Gib Johnson, said that while some of the essays seemed rather weak, others were ''clear and enormously entertaining.'' THE WOMAN WHO ESCAPED FROM SHAME, by Toby Olson. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) Using tales told by a trio of sailors traveling in the Baja with three prostitutes, Toby Olson constructs a labyrinth of interconnected stories all revolving around horses. ''The landscape is that of Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan novels,'' Robert Kelly said here last year. ''The mysterious cult of the horse, the crisscrossed affinities, stand before us with the innocence of dreams.'' MICHAEL FARADAY: A Biography, by L. Pearce Williams. (Da Capo, $13.95.) Michael Faraday's discovery in the 19th century that moving a magnet along a wire generates electricity helped set the first cornerstone in the continuing attempt to devise a grand unification theory: if electricity and magnetism are related, then why not gravity and the nuclear forces as well? ''Anybody who knows enough about electricity to screw in a light bulb can follow most of Faraday's experiments as they are described in this book,'' one reviewer said in 1965, ''and the occasional puzzling paragraph can only intensify the suspense of a scientific epic that is also a harrowing intellectual thriller.''",1987-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Used by Spenco for bed pads, wheelchair cushions and cold packs, the gel behaves like a layer of muscle tissue. Rather than crushing like foam when a rider sits, the gel reacts to pelvic pressure by redistributing itself within a flexible shell. The gel is controlled in a Y-shaped form that spreads support evenly and reduces hard spots. The gel goes back to its original shape when the rider gets off the seat. Sold under the Avocet label as the GelFlex saddle, it is available at most bicycle stores. The seat comes in three models: men's, women's and racing. The women's saddle is wider and shorter than the men's to conform to a different pelvic structure; the racing saddle is thinner than the others.

Not surprising, since Mr. Graves is appearing in an advertisement citing ''the significance of classic structures,'' in which footwear by the Dexter Shoe Company of West Newton, Mass., is paired with the architect's post-modernist ideas. According to Woody Kay, the co-creative director and executive vice president of Pagano, Schenck and Kay, the agency in Providence, R.I., that created the advertisement, the architect is one of those ''very interesting people who have had extraordinary success in their own field'' whom they will be using in their campaign. Others include Ted Williams, the legendary baseball player, and David Tedrick, a yacht designer. Mr. Graves readily agreed to the project. He said the company paid him ''some money'' for it and sent along a pair of boat shoes, and that was that. ''The only ad I've done,'' he said, adding that he and his staff ''rewrote some of the copy.'' After it appeared, ''there was a lot of grief from my peers,'' Mr. Graves conceded.",1987-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,A DOCTOR TREATS ANTIQUE RADIOS,"PETER THOMASHOW explained that by restoring old radios that he found in ''almost destroyed condition'' in flea markets and junk shops, he felt he was ''almost bringing them back from the dead.'' Dr. Thomashow is a psychiatrist who is also an artist, and his latest project has a twofold purpose. First, he puts the vintage radios -most date from the late 40's and the 50's - back into working order. Then he gives them a thorough facelift -sanding or stripping, painting, replacing speaker grilles and knobs, and adding such fanciful decorations as polka dots, stickers and colorfully painted computer chips. ''I call them techno-primitive artifacts,'' Dr. Thomashow said. ''They're a combination of old technology and new design flavor. Not only were the old radios in bad shape, but they were just too drab.'' His palette runs from primaries to pastels. ''In some cases I even try to create the Bakelite look,'' he added. Now that he has done quite a few radios, Dr. Thomashow is eyeing other objects. ''I may expand to all household appliances,'' he said. The radios, ranging in price from $175 to $800, are on view through Dec. 8 at Civilisation, 78 Second Avenue, between Fourth and Fifth Streets.",1987-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Can you tell me where to find these hinges? A. You should be able to find them in some of the better hardware stores and lumberyards. Try those catering to professional builders and carpenters if you cannot find them in other stores. The hinges can also be ordered from mail-order houses like Constantine's, 2050 Eastchester Road, Bronx, N.Y. 10461; 212-792-1600. Outside New York, call 800-223-8087. Q. We are having a problem with the stall shower on the second floor. The ceiling in the room below shows water damage. About 25 years ago the tile floor in the shower was removed and the pan around the drain replaced. Since then the tiles have been regrouted every few years, but we have this persistent staining problem. What do you advise? A. It sounds as if the pan needs replacing again. It might pay to install a fiberglass shower pan; this type seems to last almost indefinitely. Q. My house is heated by hot water. A radiator on the top floor gets very little heat because it is only half filled with water. A plumber advised me to open the bleeder valve; he said it would take anywhere from a day to a month for the radiator to fill. I opened the valve four months ago, but the radiator is not filled.

Entrees rotate daily, but you might choose budin de tortilla, a Mexican casserole with alternating layers of soft corn tortillas, shredded chicken, cheese and hot chilies, or try the sauteed shrimp over a nutty and peppery pumpkin sauce.

Page 1 President Reagan is prepared, ''very well briefed'' and ''confident in our positions'' in advance of his meeting next month with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, a senior White House official said. 6 16 missionaries and children died at the hands of anti-Government guerrillas in Zimbabwe. Farm workers said the assailants sang ''revolutionary songs'' as they hacked the bound missionaries and their children to death. 1 Two Frenchmen gained freedom after being held for months by a shadowy Lebanese group. Diplomats said the freeing of Jean-Louis Normandin, a cameraman, and Roger Auque, a photojournalist, followed extensive talks involving France, Syria and Iran. 1 More gunshots in Haiti's capital frightened residents, but no new killings were reported two days before the country's first presidential election in 30 years. 5 Haitian motorists were terrorized outside the town of St.-Marc by a ragged band of men armed with machetes and knives that residents feared were remnants of the Tontons Macoute, the militia of the Duvalier regime. 1 Japan may have to modify policies on the economy, taxes and trade to maintain smooth relations with other countries, the new Prime Minister, Noboru Takeshita, said in his first major policy speech. 29 Increased supplies of oil have put the industrial countries in a position to withstand even a major disruption of the flow of petroleum from the Persian Gulf, according to senior Western officials. 29 Seoul ordered no interference by the country's military chiefs in next month's presidential election. The defense chief also said soldiers must vote by secret ballot. 3 South Africa's censors approved the release of Sir Richard Attenborough's movie, ''Cry Freedom,'' without any cuts or restrictions.

But Federal officials said they believed a settlement might occur soon. 1 14 Cuban-American leaders, including Mayor Xavier Suarez of Miami, spent seven hours conferring with officials of the Federal prison in Atlanta, but were not allowed to see the Cuban inmates who are holding 94 hostages. 28 The dollar continued to slide and gold prices advanced in quiet trading. Treasury bond prices dropped sharply and stock prices also declined in a very slow semiholiday turnover. 38 A cheaper dollar helps sales for United States-made products at home and abroad, but many economists are beginning to warn that, along with the potential benefits of a falling dollar, there are significant costs and some substantial risks. 1 Developers play an increasing role in metropolitan America and are now providing social services, financing of school and cultural facilities, preserving the environment and aiding low-income housing. 1 University-think tank links are under increasing strain. One conservative study organization with close ties to the Reagan Administration has had angry exchanges with liberal faculty members. 46 Mine closings in West Virginia have impoverished McDowell County, in a corner of Appalachia where coal is no longer king. 7 Changes in the Dukakis campaign involve the resignation of the Presidential aspirant's press secretary, Patricia O'Brien, and a new assignment for a second top staff member, Jack Corrigan. 7 A divided family reunites 7 Survey challenges standardized test results 7 Illinois gets a large share of Federal road funds 24 REGIONAL 25-27 Arrests and summonses won rewards from a transit police commander, with the prizes based on the highest numbers. Four of the subordinates are suspected of making scores of false or improper arrests. 25 News analysis: the school crisis in New York City has prompted a sense of disintegration at the Board of Education, and many officials, including three key members of the board, seek its dissolution. 27 Catholic schools are changing, admitting more children of other faiths, particularly in New York City.

us,Passing the Test,"In 265 drug tests administered at random to athletes competing in track and field events throughout Britain over the last 18 months, two positive results were obtained, according to an announcement yesterday in London by the British Amateur Athletics Board. Sue Howland, an Australian javelin thrower, was suspended after testing positive for steroids at a meet in Belfast, Northern Ireland, last summer, and Jayne Andrews, a British sprinter, tested positive for a stimulant, but appealed successfully because she was taking the drug for a chest infection. Among 131 top British stars who passed were Steve Ovett, a former world-record holder in the mile; Fatima Whitehead, the women's world champion in the javelin, and Linford Christie, the European sprint titlist. The board said that five international competitors, all now retired, declined to take the test, but none were of the stature of Ovett, Whitehead or Christie. Among athletes not subjected to the tests were Sebastian Coe, an Olympic 1,500-meter champion, and Steve Cram, the former mile world-record holder. The board said that it was taking the unusual step of releasing names of athletes who had passed the test because of growing reports that drug use was increasing at the top levels of track and field. ''We intend to be as open as possible about our drug-testing program,'' said Tony Ward, a board spokesman. ''We do not say it is perfect, but it is much better than most.''",1987-11-28T05:00:00+0000

Bond said yesterday in Perth that in view of the decision this week by the New York State Supreme Court to allow America's Cup races to be contested by yachts longer than the models used exclusively for the last 30 years, the San Diego Yacht Club should abide by that finding and announce its intention to conduct a multinational and multichallenger series. The court decision ruled valid a New Zealand challenge for 1988 in boats 90 feet long at the waterline. Bond said he hopes that the San Diego syndicate does not restrict the competition to New Zealand. Bond's syndicate is prepared to contest at the 90-foot length. ''The court has upheld the tradition of the deed of gift and now it's impreative that Sail America uphold the international status of the event and not restrict it to a one-on-one match with the Kiwis,'' he said. ''There is no further need for the courts. The judgment is precise and clear. There's no doubt the San Diego Yacht Club should cease stalling and start sailing.''",1987-11-28T05:00:00+0000

If you've ever wondered how some of the sillier dialogue gets into movies, John Sayles has a convincing explanation. Give a studio executive a script for a western, and there will come a time when, unable to visualize the stampeding buffalo herd, he will wonder, ''Couldn't one of the Indians say, 'Here come the buffalo'?'' ''Thinking in Pictures'' aims to wipe out such cinematic illiteracy. Mr. Sayles, the writer and director of ''Matewan'' (and several earlier movies), takes us through his creation of this current, critically praised film about a violent feud between mine owners and union activists in 1920 West Virginia. The true film artist, he demonstrates, must be thoroughly practical to put his vision on screen. Raising money is a Sisyphean job; in the three years it took to get backers for ''Matewan,'' production costs rose from $1.8 million to $3.6 million. Even that is a paltry amount for a period film, so Mr. Sayles lets us in on his small economies. (Shoot crowd scenes early in the day, and avoid paying extras overtime.) He talks about casting, gives pithy definitions of what grips and gaffers do, reproduces the film's shooting script, recalls how the crew pushed a car so the motor's noise wouldn't interfere with dialogue. All that's missing is a sense of the pain and bloodletting often involved in a film maker's practical compromises, but for the curious movie viewer this is a lively tale of how some of the smarter movies get made.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

Again and again he reminds us that the art of acting is the art of conjuring much out of little, or more out of less, or something out of nothing.

It's the art of taking a line as flat as a parking lot in a small Midwestern town and somehow suggesting that there's an abundance of animal life in the fissures and crannies beneath its surface.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"ACROSS, by Peter Handke. Translated by Ralph Manheim. (Collier/Macmillan, $6.95.) The Austrian writer Peter Handke uses fiction to explore the ways in which we can escape from the labyrinths of language into subjective realms. His novel about Andreas Loser, an archeologist who literally gets away with murder, is ''one of the most arresting and expansive'' of his books, Lawrence Graver said in The Book Review last year. RISING FROM THE PLAINS, by John McPhee. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $7.95.) Journalism to John McPhee sometimes seems an excuse for making interesting new friends - experts on plutonium recycling, for example, or birchbark canoes. Recently Mr. McPhee has been spending time with geologists, and his third book on earth's ancient history is as good as the first two, our reviewer, Evan S. Connell, said in 1986. ''You need not have passed Geology 101 to enjoy 'Rising From the Plains,' but it might help. . . . Nevertheless, this instructive account . . . is a delight.'' NO COUNTRY FOR YOUNG MEN, by Julia O'Faolain. (Carroll & Graf, $8.95.) A Californian who goes to Ireland in the early 1970's to write a screenplay about a 50-year-old murder case finds himself on a terrorist group's hit list. The novel ''is a stunning performance,'' Julian Moynahan said here earlier this year. MAKING HAY, by Verlyn Klinkenborg. Illustrated by Gordon Allen. (Vintage, $5.95.) At a time when American agriculture is in a decline and farmers are giving up hope, Verlyn Klinkenborg tells of the beauty of life in the Midwest. ''In writing in loving detail about one part of farming - making hay - [ he ] gives the reader some understanding of why . . . those of us who do farm stay on the land,'' Sue Hubbell said here last year. GOD'S SNAKE, by Irini Spanidou. (Penguin, $6.95.) Anna, a girl growing up in Greece during the 1950's, is treated by her father, a military officer, as though she were one of his recruits. Irini Spanidou's first novel ''freshly evokes the beauties and terrors of childhood,'' Nicholas Bromell said in The Book Review last year. THE FIFTIES: From Notebooks and Diaries of the Period, by Edmund Wilson. Edited and with an introduction by Leon Edel. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.95.) The personal writings previously published in ''The Twenties,'' ''The Thirties'' and ''The Forties'' may have detracted from the critic Edmund Wilson's reputation as ''the human equivalent of the Modern Library: a one-man institution for the propagation of serious writing,'' Joseph Epstein said here in 1986. With ''The Fifties'' matters seem to be improving. The book's literary portraits of T. S. Eliot, Isaiah Berlin, Andre Malraux and W. H. Auden are ''the sort one hopes for from the journals of a literary man.'' FOOLS CROW, by James Welch. (Penguin, $7.95.) In this novel about a young Blackfoot warrior and medicine man living in the Montana Territory in the late 1800's, James Welch artfully blends the real with the unreal ''until neither we nor the characters themselves can tell the difference,'' Peter Wild said here last year. ''To a rather loose and, some might argue, episodic plot . . . Mr. Welch fastens . . . compelling aspects of the culture -the prayers, ghosts, dreams and waking visions that make up a warrior's spiritual life.'' CITY OF NETS: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's, by Otto Friedrich. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) Hollywood, a land of palm trees that look artificial and stuccoed houses perched precariously atop hills, is often used as a symbol for all that is crass and ephemeral about American culture. No one has ''flogged the metaphor quite so remorselessly'' as has Otto Friedrich, Neal Gabler said here in 1986, ''and few . . . have done it quite so well. . . . This is the Scheherazade of Hollywood - a spellbinding incantation of every adventure and misadventure within the film community.'' TUXEDO PARK, by Laura Furman. (Fawcett, $4.50.) Opposites supposedly attract, but Sadie, who loves domesticity, and Willard, a restless intellectual, are so fundamentally different that their marriage seems flawed from the start. This novel about a mismatched pair ''generates very little heat,'' our reviewer, Frances Taliaferro, said last year. But it ''has the agreeably static quality of [ the author's ] very good short stories.'' PAT NIXON: The Untold Story, by Julie Nixon Eisenhower. (Zebra, $4.50.) It hasn't been easy being Richard Nixon's wife, as Julie Nixon Eisenhower shows in this book about her mother. Although Mrs. Eisenhower spends too much time defending her father, her ''buoyant spirit, coupled with some impressive research, provides fresh insights into a much maligned and misunderstood woman,'' Judy Woodruff said here last year. TO THE LAND OF THE CATTAILS, by Aharon Appelfeld. Translated by Jeffrey M. Green. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) The word ''Nazi'' never appears in this novel about a Jewish woman and her son who flee Vienna in 1938 for her Central European homeland. ''But the quiet pathos of this futile journey . . . powerfully realizes the awful helplessness of a European Jewry trapped among enemies,'' Robert Alter said in The Book Review last year. Aharon Appelfeld ''conveys an almost hallucinatory sense of the Holocaust as an irrevocable historical divide.'' THE LEAGUE: The Rise and Decline of the NFL, by David Harris. (Bantam, $4.95.) Since football is a business as much as a game, David Harris has chosen to focus not on the players but on the people who run and profit from it. ''There are those who will find the business practices Mr. Harris ascribes to many of the owners shocking,'' Ron Rosenbaum said here last year. ''Still, his painstakingly detailed accounts . . . cumulatively attain a kind of comic-epic grandeur.''",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

W., White Plains Answer: The correct response is to name the city, the passport division of the United States Bureau of Consular Affairs says. Where to find the city in your passport - if you cannot remember where it was issued - depends on whether you have one of the machine-readable passports, made with the help of automation, or the earlier model, which was produced manually. On a newer passport - the first were issued in Washington in February 1981 and they are still being phased in - the city is given on the inside front cover below the words Passport Agency.

Fuzzy Zoeller won only one hole but, with carryovers, it was worth $70,000 and pushed his Skins Game earnings to $695,000. Lee Trevino, the shortest hitter in the Hall of Fame foursome that is competing on the extremely difficult PGA West course, won the only other skin, worth $25,000, with a birdie on the par-5 eighth hole.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"WHITE LIGHT. By Patricia Volk. (Atheneum, $18.95.) This inventive if flawed first novel is half comic strip, half yuppie spiritual crisis. When 35-year-old May Graves, an art director at a magazine for teen-agers, makes an ill-received comment at a meeting, trouble begins. A month away from New York City is what she needs, and soon May is in a hotel in the Adirondacks trying desperately to return to a simpler state. She is the only guest, but no matter. There is a caretaker, a young man whose father drowned minutes after he was conceived and who is convinced the body still lies at the bottom of the lake. Another young man, with a tattoo and a red Peugeot, is nearby in a cabin in the woods. Then May's boring but adoring dentist husband shows up unexpectedly. There is also an enclave of Orthodox Jewish dwarfs in the neighborhood, and when May is not worrying about the men in her life - and the dwarfs aren't asking her husband to check the overbite on their new spiritual leader - she calls her mother, precipitating lots of motherly advice conversations. Barring the first chapter, which gratuitously combines statistics about working women and IUD-related blood clots, ''White Light'' is entertaining and occasionally funny. But though May's wish to confront her spiritual and physical emptiness (a sort of death, or ''white light'') seems genuine, she and most of the other characters are either not well developed or too outlandish, and fail to elicit much sympathy.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

Reedy, who had been President Johnson's longtime press secretary and special assistant, first published this book in 1970, it was fairly hailed as a distinguished and thoughtful - and sometimes frightening - essay on government. The Presidency, said Mr. Reedy then and says Mr. Reedy now, is an institution designed to shield its occupant from reality, to isolate him from the nation and to make sure that he responds, responsibly or not, to impulse and personal doctrine. It is not, in Mr. Reedy's view, a great way to run a country. By 1970, the White House had reduced Lyndon Johnson, a canny politician by anyone's standard, to a political jelly and Richard Nixon remained insulated from the continued popular demand for the end of the Vietnam war. In this astute updated edition, with four more Presidents (including Mr. Nixon) under our national belt, Mr. Reedy finds little to cheer him. Presidents Ford, Carter and, curiously, Reagan he sees as ''caretaker'' Chief Executives, who give the impression of being more dynamic than they actually are. Gerald Ford at least had nothing up his sleeve; Jimmy Carter's background equipped him to be a mover and shaker, but the country didn't want that. Ronald Reagan is ''the epitome of the caretaker'' - someone who can keep various groups from organizing to depose him while simultaneously creating ''the illusion of action when not very much is actually going on.'' While Mr. Reedy sees no changes likely in the institution of the Presidency itself, he does see America as resilient, ultimately constructing ''counterbalancing forces that are bringing us back to reality.''

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CIRCLES OF DECEIT. By Nina Bawden. (St. Martin's, $14.95.) The British novelist Nina Bawden's latest work is aptly named, since most of its characters are deceiving someone, not infrequently themselves. The unnamed narrator, a painter, has even elevated the practice to an art. He makes finely detailed copies of important works by the masters - always for legitimate purposes - and uses the income to finance his smaller output of originals. He is, however, also frequently engaged in less wholesome deceit, as is his family. His first wife, a dentist, precipitates the end of their marriage by having an affair with a colleague. His second hides her abuse of her illegitimate son. The narrator's mother may be hiding the real reason she left his father; her sister meddles in other people's lives. Only the painter's son by his first marriage is relatively lacking in guile, possibly because he's schizophrenic. Ms. Bawden makes comic use of these characters' foibles, but there is considerable sadness beneath her evocative scenes and lively dialogue. Really a meditation on the nature of art, the novel argues that there is little the creative process can do to relieve human suffering. Art, Ms. Bawden implies, may be the grandest deception, enabling the artist to portray the world as he wishes it to be rather than as it is. She reveals her point subtly - so subtly the novel occasionally seems plodding. But although very little happens, she makes the reader care about these people's trials. However much her characters deceive, it's refreshing to see that Nina Bawden's own talent is nothing less than genuine.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

And no wonder; these days, the Syosset resident is known as the world's most recorded (and lauded, by critics) bassoon soloist. Naturally, he's determined to spread the news and the sound of what he considers a wonderfully expressive solo instrument. So when he takes to the stage he calls his concerts ''Basically Bassoon''. Today, when he appears at the Freeport Memorial Library at 3 P.M., cellist Stephen Green, and pianist Barbara Kupferberg will provide some of the other basics in a program that also includes works by Galliard, Jacob, Miroshnikov and Kriesler, and even some ''Londonderry Airs'' and ''Yankee Doodle''. The Library is on South Ocean Avenue and the concert, under the aegis of the Nassau County Office of Cultural Development, is free. HOLIDAY TOURS All decked out for the holidays, area homes provide a tempting destination for folks who like to see how others live. This week there are three house tours on tap. Tuesday, the Nassau County Women's Division of the Salvation Army gains from a tour of four houses in the Bellmore-Wantagh neighborhood (including a farmhouse, circa 1644, q and a 1794 Georgian mansion that's an historic landmark); a 125-year-old Quaker meeting house; and an 1885 Long Island Railroad Station. The buildings will be open from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and for reservations call 747-4902. In Amityvile, the Junior League of the local Woman's Club holds its 32nd annual Holiday Homes Tour Saturday. Three local homes -an old Victorian, an ultra-modern contemporary,and a '50's ranch house -- will be on display from 1 to 4 P.M. and for ticket information call 842-2891.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"RINGER. By Marshall Terry. (Corona/ Texas Monthly, $16.95.) ''Ringer'' is a self-conscious retelling of the biblical story of the prodigal son, with characters who never rise from their flat landscape. An elderly widow, Eliza MacDuff Ringer, has been transplanted from a small Texas town to an apartment in Dallas so she can be close to her one responsible son, Bill. He, however, is only living off his reputation for responsibility. In reality, no one has any idea ''how close to the edge . . . Bill Ringer was.'' Eliza has it in her head that she is going to die and asks Bill to find his long-lost brother, Joe. Bill is not thrilled with his mother's request, but begins making a few lame inquiries. When the reader finally meets Joe it is easy to see why no one except his mother cares much about his absence. He is the kind of guy who can - and does - steal a friend's credit card and is sure the friend won't mind. Not a lot is happening in ''Ringer,'' a state of affairs that would be more palatable if Marshall Terry, the author of two previous novels, compensated by providing fascinating characters who create some emotional tension. Unfortunately the story stays slack, and the characters are so lifeless they seem to be interested in one another only out of a sense of duty.

Drug abuse is a serious national problem, but part of that problem is public and governmental misunderstanding and over-reaction: that is the important theme of ''Steal This Urine Test,'' and it's one that the book documents thoroughly. There have been repeated Federal wars on drugs, but their lasting impact has been doubtful at best. Abbie Hoffman, a pillar of the anti-Establishment establishment for a quarter of a century, and Jonathan Silvers, who has written extensively on politics and culture, argue that the useful impact of such campaigns has been zero. There have been much-publicized ''billion-dollar'' captures of drugs destined for the American market, yet that market remains vigorous. The book castigates the present Administration for cutting back funding for drug rehabilitation programs, and it notes the tragic disparity between an estimated 200,000 heroin addicts in the New York metropolitan area and a capacity to treat 35,000. But the authors' prime target is the use of urine testing to detect illegal drug use - a practice that certainly raises serious problems of violation of privacy and civil liberties. Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Silvers offer frightening incidents, gleaned from recent court cases. ''This is a call to arms against a ritual that has nothing to do with drug abuse and a lot to do with controlling citizens,'' Mr. Hoffman says in the introduction. It is an argument that deserves a hearing.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000

E., Elmhurst, Queens Answer: Although you have the right to seek credit information on prospective tenants, credit-rating services might not respond to inquiries that come directly from you. Marvin Kaplan, a spokesman for Associated Credit Bureaus, a trade organization representing credit information companies, suggests that you ask prospective tenants to have a credit service report sent to them, which they then could show to you. Anyone who has ever applied for a credit card, charge account, bank loan or mortgage is likely to have a credit rating.

Ms. Dunham attracted attention during the 40's for fast-paced revues based on African and Caribbean folklore. She certainly knew how to set audiences cheering. Yet she also always did her homework. A graduate student in anthropology at the University of Chicago in the 30's, she based her productions on authentic source materials.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE BERKUT. By Joseph Heywood. (Random House, $18.95.) Adolf Hitler killed himself in the spring of 1945 as the Red Army advanced on his bunker in Berlin. Or did he? Groan. Not another novel about how Hitler or one of his henchmen survived to sin another day. But don't despair. Joseph Heywood's second novel isn't your run-of-the-mill Nazi-hunting twaddle. If you're willing to ignore a few facts and accept that a double, not Hitler, died beneath the Third Reich's Chancellery, ''The Berkut'' is a pretty good thriller. Mr. Heywood has done a lot of research, stitching fact and fiction together with few traces of thread. And though the book is a bit long, he manages to keep up the pace. Most important, he writes better than he has to. One even wonders why he doesn't take a few more chances and write himself out of the genre entirely. This isn't a typical thriller pitting good against evil. It's hard to love or hate the characters. They are thugs or wimps, and just as you get to like one he coldly knocks off an innocent bystander or whines about the weather. Hitler is a sniveling twit, not a monster. And he's as batty as Stalin, who orders his top agent, a mystic manque with a savage streak, to haul the Fuhrer, alive and kicking, to the Kremlin. The book's title comes from the name of a golden eagle used by the Kirghiz Tatars to hunt wolves. Hitler, a k a Herr Wolf, diminishes in importance, as both a character and a man, as he flees across Europe with the help of two SS commandos. We fear him, then pity him and, finally, we exorcise his ghost.",1987-11-29T05:00:00+0000
