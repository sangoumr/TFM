Vanderlyn had gone to France for academic training. His masterpiece, Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos (1809-14), a suavely erotic, neo-Classical vision of a nude woman dozing in a pastoral landscape, is one of the gems of the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. But a discerning viewer today might well prefer Phillips. His Girl in Red Dress With Cat and Dog (1830-35) is one of the loveliest paintings by any American artist. ",2015-01-01T18:50:13+0000

The 31 acres of marshlands and pasture that Higginson donated to Harvard College, his alma mater, would serve as the site of the countrys oldest concrete football arena, Harvard Stadium, built over a decade later in 1903. As he memorialized the Civil War dead, the Union veteran addressed a group of 400 male students and alumni, most of whom were too young to have experienced and learned from the horrors of battle during the nations bloodiest war. Like Higginson, however, many late-19th-century Americans saw a deep connection between the battlefield and the athletic field, believing that collegiate athletics, including football, could teach the next generation their own duties as men and citizens of the Republic and train them to manage the burden of carrying on this country in the best way.

Brill is best known as a media mogul and entrepreneur: He founded The American Lawyer magazine in 1979, followed a decade later by Court TV and then by the short-lived magazine Brills Content. (I believe in journalism, he told the National Press Club in 1998. I believe deeply in journalism. Apparently he still does; his latest venture is a partnership with The Timess former executive editor Jill Abramson to promote articles too long for a magazine and too short for a book.) But Brill also has personal experience with the best-seller list: In 1978 he hit the nonfiction list with his first book, The Teamsters  the whole squalid story meticulously researched, according to the Book Review back then  while in 2011 he spent a few weeks on the extended list with Class Warfare, a look at education in America. Reviewing Grishams novel, Brill had some kind words for its political observations, although he didnt think much of what he called Grishamstyle: At times, he wrote, his weakness with words is painful to watch, . . . as if someone new to English decided to mimic The Bonfire of the Vanities.

This is war but bloodier, one voice tells another. Nah, the other replies, I seen war and this is darling compared. Those brave enough to forge ahead are soon faced with a fond recollection of a sexual act with a steers heart and a story that culminates in a dogs hanging itself, among other atrocities. On Harts late-19th-century Pacific Coast, nothing stays clean for long, literally or spiritually: White here is brave and temporary, steam in the windows, ice in the pan. Violence is a way to pass the time, and time is just counting down to death. Hopes, when a character dares to have any, are shattered into pieces, those pieces burned and the ashes tossed into the ocean. ",2015-01-02T16:38:05+0000

Well, not really. His name isnt Henry, its Jens, and he isnt a high school guidance counselor, hes a Danish cartoonist on the run from terrorists. But hes not one of the Danish cartoonists youre thinking of, the ones who satirized the Muslim world with their representations of Muhammad. Rather, hes a different Danish cartoonist, one who drew a cartoon about the other cartoonists, and whose cartoonist cartoon proves to be just as controversial as the original cartoonists cartoons. Anyway, for the purposes of this paragraph, lets just say hes a high school guidance counselor in Broomeville, N.Y., a cold and isolated upstate town. Although, really, hes one of two guidance counselors there. The first one has been fired for being a drunk, but actually shes been fired so that the principal of the school, Matty, who is sort of the protagonist  well, wait, hes not really the protagonist, per se, hes one of several people who function, at various times, as protagonists  but as I was saying, Matty has fired the original guidance counselor in order to do a favor for his ex-lover, the wildlife researcher, which is to hire Henry, who is actually Jens. Because the ex-lover, whose name is Locs but really its Lorraine, isnt a wildlife researcher anymore, shes a C.I.A. agent. And she is trying to protect the cartoonist-of-cartoonists-cum-guidance-counselor by hiding him in Broomeville from the terrorists, who are actually, it turns out, just this one guy, who, it also turns out, is not really a terrorist. But, it further turns out, shes just trying to find a way to get Matty (whom she calls Matthew) back, though she never really had him in the first place.",2015-01-02T16:38:15+0000

Whether captured in Africa or born into bondage in the Americas, slaves suffered unimaginable torments and indignities. Yet the specific form their miseries took, as the historian Richard S. Dunn shows in his painstakingly researched A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia, depended on whether one was a slave in the British Caribbean or in the United States. The contrasts between the two slave societies were many, covering family life, religious beliefs and labor practices. But one difference overrode all others. In the Caribbean, white masters treated the slaves like disposable cogs in a machine, working them to death on sugar plantations and then replacing them with fresh stock from Africa. In the United States, white masters treated their slaves like the machine itself  a breeding machine.",2015-01-02T16:38:19+0000

All ships of United Kingdom and colonial registry, with the exception of vessels of Indian and Burman registry, will be taken over when they discharge their first cargo in Great Britain after that date. The scheme, identical to the one employed successfully during the World War, will make it possible to operate ships more efficiently and economically because of the community of interests of the British Dominions, it was explained. Such a control system, it was stated, will result in a regular execution of the shipping program for the efficient conduct of the war. The companies will continue to manage and operate their ships as though carrying on their own business but will receive instructions as to the cargoes to be carried and the routes to be followed. They will maintain their organizations in Britain and abroad but will keep an account of costs for the Ministry. Operating profits and losses are to be treated as on government account.

Upstairs, Lord Grantham stews about the first Labour Government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and what he perceives as its anti-aristocracy stance. Downstairs, the servants think that someone in charge might finally understand the concept of hard work. Lady Edith, meanwhile, turns to the tenant farmer Mr. Drewe and his unsuspecting wife to secret away Marigold, her illegitimate daughter with her married lover, Michael Gregson, still missing in Germany. Lady Mary finds herself inundated by dashing suitors. And when the committee in charge of creating a World War I memorial comes knocking, it isnt Lord Grantham they want, but rather Mr. Carson, the butler. In The Manners of Downton Abbey, at 10:15, Alastair Bruce, an expert on royal ceremony and custom who serves as the shows historical adviser, discusses the code of conduct that governed Britain in the early 20th century and how he goes about tutoring the actors in speaking, sitting, dressing and keeping an appropriately stiff upper lip.

(Showtime) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric, above at right with Max von Sydow; Emmanuelle Seigner is Cline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Jose Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. The phrase triumph of the human spirit hovers over The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichs, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind  among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration  Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual, he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.",2015-01-05T05:21:07+0000

Both found a whimsical, child-friendly charm in the eccentricities of subjects few would have called ideal picture-book material: the neurotic Victorian Peter Mark Roget, who came up with the idea for the thesaurus, and the reclusive avant-garde artist Joseph Cornell, who innovated with assemblage. Two new ones are particularly welcome additions to the genre, for both their beautiful illustrations and their stirring stories: Each takes up the life of a 20th-century artist whose accomplishments are no doubt too rarefied to be already familiar to the average elementary schooler; but the subjects experiences growing up African-American in the segregated South, then making their ways through civil-rights-era America, give a natural storybook feel to their life trajectories.",2015-01-07T15:00:12+0000

Everybody talks frantically about media, a second-order subject if ever there was one, as content disappears into content. What does the understanding of media contribute to the understanding of life? Journalistic institutions slowly transform themselves into silent sweatshops in which words cannot wait for thoughts, and first responses are promoted into best responses, and patience is a professional liability.

Animal rights groups have long condemned foie gras, which has traditionally been produced by force-feeding ducks and geese, as inhumane. Many chefs across the state, who had lamented the loss of a favored ingredient, were elated by the ruling. The person who buys our foie gras called us from the courthouse crying with happiness, said Jon Shook, one of the chef-owners of Animal in Los Angeles. The judge ruled the ban unconstitutional because it attempted to override existing federal law regulating poultry products. The state can appeal the decision, and animal rights groups warned that restaurants that serve it could face protests. Foie gras is French for fatty liver, and fathead is the American word for the shameless chefs who actually need a law to make them stop serving the swollen, near-bursting organ of a cruelly force-fed bird, Ingrid E.

(Showtime) FINDING VIVIAN MAIER (2014) In 2007, John Maloof bought a box of negatives  nearly 40,000, taken from the 1950s to the 70s  at a Chicago auction for about $400. He was told they were by Vivian Maier, but a Google search revealed no information about her. Eventually he mounted some of the works on Flickr, which led to a story in the British newspaper The Independent and an exhibition at the Chicago Cultural Center about Ms. Maier, a nanny and amateur street photographer who died in 2009. This film, which Mr. Maloof directed with Charlie Siskel, documents his search for the woman behind the images while serving as a sort of feature-length advertisement for the work he owns, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Its no surprise that Maier is now the subject of a documentary, given the quality of her work, the nominal exoticism of her life and the secrets that still drift around her, Ms. Dargis said. Shes a terrific story  part Mary Poppins, part Weegee  who was at once emancipated and in service. Still, she added, time and professional pronouncements will decide if she was an outsider artist or just an unorthodox one who, as a single 20th-century woman, found freedom, her voice and her own private bohemia while under cover of other peoples bourgeois domesticity.

(Showtime) PHILOMENA (2013) With the help of a former political journalist (Steve Coogan), an Irish Roman Catholic woman (Judi Dench, in an Oscar-nominated performance) seeks the son who was taken from her 50 years earlier, when she became pregnant as a teenager and was forced to live in a convent, in this drama directed by Stephen Frears. Their sleuthing takes them to Washington after they discover that the boy  sold for 1,000 pounds  was adopted by an American couple and worked for the Reagan administration as an adult. Ms. Denchs Philomena Lee glows with the radiance of someone serene in her faith despite inhumane treatment by the church, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.

The death of Costante Garibaldi added fuel to the fire. All Rome mourns Garibaldis grandson tu  lennemi, as the simple but eloquent inscription on Brunos coffin read. As I telegraphed to you yesterday [Jan. 8], no funeral ever drew so vast a crowd, and General Ricciotti Garibaldis heartfelt words over his sons grave, foreshadowing Italys speedy avenging of the lieutenants death, stirred the blood of the whole nation. There was, at the beginning of the European war, a great outburst on the part of the Italian people. War against Austria appeared inevitable, as a consequence of the aggressive action against Servia, which action, in case it proved successful, would have profoundly affected the Balkanic equilibrium.

The sister of the title is, of course, Virginia Woolf, who understood how hard it is for a novelist to capture a character. Few catch the phantom, Woolf said in a lecture at Cambridge in 1924, the year before the publication of Mrs. Dalloway. Most have to be content with a scrap of her dress or a wisp of her hair. Parmars portrait brings Vanessa out of the shadows, into fully realized, shining visibility. The world remembers Virginia better than her enigmatic older sister: Parmar restores the symmetry of their relationship in the familial landscape, showing how essential Vanessas steadying force was to Virginias precarious balance.

One wonders what Eliot would have made of Kate Chase Sprague  daughter of a Civil War-era American cabinet minister, wife of a governor, mistress of a senator  whose career as a behind-the-scenes kingmaker is chronicled in John Ollers American Queen. Beautiful, wealthy and clever, she could dazzle a Washington salon or (said one historian) scheme like a cigar-chewing convention rigger.

Is it more cowardly to refuse to fight or to fight for fear of being called a coward for not fighting? Some people claim to have the answers to such questions about this once familiar and unproblematic subject, but they tend to disagree. There is no consensus as to who is a coward and who is not  or even about whether the question is one of any importance. Cowardice, whatever it means, must seem a matter of individual choice, like everything else, and the implied judgment made by the term probably requires that we decline to use it at all.",2015-01-09T17:12:43+0000

To be sure, monographs by James Goodman and Thomas Sugrue have explored the dark side of Northern race relations.

When Gerritsens son wanted a vacation from the farm he and his partner own in Maine, his parents agreed to take over for two weeks. Theres a comforting rhythm to farming, Gerritsen wrote on her blog. Every morning, the cows stand eagerly at the fence, excited to see us bringing hay, and the sheep come stampeding like hungry children. . . . Ive found out that I love hanging out with chickens. Ive learned which hen leaves the flock every morning to hide out with the sheep, and which hen sneaks away to spend time with the outcast rooster. Ive learned the secret places where those two lay their eggs. Ive learned that the alpha rooster can be brutal with hens (and Im going to talk to my son about turning him into coq au vin). The wry sadism of that last sentence wont surprise Gerritsens readers  in the opening pages of Die Again, a murdered taxidermist is discovered hung and dressed like game in his garage, with organs discarded in a nearby trash can. The inspiration for the organs, at least, may have come from the farm.

Collaborating with Max Pearmain, the stylist and editor of fashion magazine Arena Homme Plus, as well as the art director Jonathan Baron, Pieter created a voyeuristic look at the new collection, which features a cool merging of activewear with unconventional tailoring and knitwear: athletic tights layered under knit tops with slashed openings (inspired by Lucio Fontana paintings) and unstructured outerwear made from fabrics typically used for uniforms of the Royal Guard. Filmed in a bleak office environment with expansive views of Londons Financial District and composed of grainy time-stamped clips mimicking security footage, the video, which will run on loop during the presentation, grounds the clothes, says the young designer (albeit rather eerily). For this new season, as with his previous two collections, Pieter, who worked both in publishing (Fantastic Man) and design (for Jil Sander under Raf Simons) before launching his own line in early 2014, explores the loosening and blurring of mens sartorial norms through more feminine cuts and roomier silhouettes.

Thaw and his wife, Clare, benefactors of the Morgan and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, have donated 135 oil sketches to the two institutions, in addition to giving hundreds of old master and 19th-century drawings to the Morgan. Mr. Thaw has described the sketches as the most wonderful, fresh, free pieces on paper  work that mattered to him because it mattered to the artists, who considered them much more than disposable studies: They traded them amongst each other, and they preserved them.

(IFC) IGBY GOES DOWN (2002) Kieran Culkin portrays Igby, a 17-year-old military school runaway who camps out in a New York loft as he rebels against his preppy older brother (Ryan Phillippe) and high-strung mother (Susan Sarandon), in this sarcastic comedy written and directed by Burt Steers. Amanda Peet, above with Mr. Culkin, is the heroin-addicted choreographer and trophy girlfriend of Igbys wealthy godfather and benefactor (Jeff Goldblum) with whom Igby finds solace; Bill Pullman is Igbys father, in a mental hospital after a schizophrenic breakdown. Even though the movie drifts uneasily between satire and realism, and its visions of military school and bohemia feel secondhand, it maintains a ruthless emotional honesty, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Ultimately, it gets at something that no other recent American movie has captured quite so acutely: a resentful, lurking disappointment in the good life.",2015-01-12T05:20:08+0000

C. Handy, who helped get those lonesome songs out into the world. But there is far more to Bluff City than blues and barbecue. A watermelon and feta salad can be found alongside great smokehouse meats; zydeco and indie rock are within earshot of soul; and up-and-coming areas like Cooper-Young are giving the citys older haunts some stiff competition.

His deeply personal Bach performances are especially compelling. In this essential new recording of three of Bachs English Suites (No. 3 in G minor, No. 1 in A, No. 5 in E minor), he uses the full tonal and colorist resources of the modern piano while vividly conveying Baroque style and sensibility.

Christopher Shannon, who has made it his signature to deconstruct and dissect active sportswear, used his designs as commentary on commercial industries and the economy. With slogans like Thanks 4 Nothing, Save Me and Broke knitted into brightly colored intarsia jumpers, the ostensibly humorous collection revealed a darker undercurrent. While Sarah Burtons military-inspired collection for Alexander McQueen displayed a mastery of tailoring, the bold capitalized words HONOUR, VALOUR and TRUTH inscribed across blazers and coats made a bigger statement. And lastly, the American designer Shaun Samson, who returned with a runway show after two seasons away, brought a Southern California flair to the London scene with his collection of bold flannel plaids, Dickies-inspired chinos and aprons adorned with the phrases DELUSIONAL RADICAL BLISS and GNARLY DANK DUDE.",2015-01-14T19:00:12+0000

us,Alexandra Fullers Leaving Before the Rains Come,"A memoir often takes one of two basic forms: In the first, the writer has an extraordinary story to tell; in the second, she has the ability to tell the common story in an extraordinary way. Sometimes  Mary McCarthys Memories of a Catholic Girlhood is an example, Paula Foxs Borrowed Finery another  the two are conflated in events on whose extremity the artistic mind succeeds in imposing literary form. I once heard the writer Aharon Appelfeld, asked why he had underplayed the savagery of his Holocaust childhood in one of his books, give the answer that extremity, whether imaginary or real, is harmful to art. What he perhaps meant was that the artists aim is to represent truth, and that certain experiences  those that infringe or violate the common sense of reality  can never be made to seem true. Joan Didion dealt interestingly with this problem in The Year of Magical Thinking, making the surreality of her husbands death at the dinner table a space the reader could philosophically inhabit. And likewise Alexandra Fuller, writing about her often tragically idiosyncratic African childhood in Dont Lets Go to the Dogs Tonight, brilliantly succeeded in retaining a childs astonished objectivity at the unfolding of bizarre events.",2015-01-14T19:09:43+0000

Their performances are not exactly subtle  nothing in The Lunchbox is exactly subtle  but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore.

The backbone of this International Brigade will be the Swedish corps under General Eric Linder, a powerful force trained and equipped and paid for by Swedes. It will operate under the supreme command of the Finnish General Staff. Otherwise, it will resemble a private army.

Her ideal is unruffled contentment. When things really flow, she says, my days become dreamlike, no edges anywhere, none of the snags and snafus that life is so famous for.

The plot of these books  in which a charismatic hero makes his way from Marss oppressed underclass into the ruling elite, where he plans a secret insurrection  has reminded some critics of the Hunger Games series, while putting others (O.K., me) in mind of Arthur Krystals observation about pulp fiction: Skilled genre writers know that a certain level of artificiality must prevail, lest the reasons we turn to their books evaporate. But in an interview last year with the publishing trade magazine Kirkus, Brown, who is 26, suggested the series is less artificial than it seems, at least to the extent it reflects his generations distrust of the political system. Im not trying to make a statement, he said; I just think it echoes a lot of the dissatisfaction that many people feel with those who make the decisions based on their own self-interests, rather than what is in the best interests of society. Its people being selfish. In the same interview, Brown said his views of cliques and social structures had been shaped in part by his childhood experiences moving from state to state with his family. A lot of times, I faced bullies  or the big dogs at school. What I wanted Red Rising to be is not necessarily an indictment on bullies, but it reflects my experiences and attitudes that I had with bullies growing up. A lot of times, you had to beat the bullies at their own game. But the difficulty is not becoming the bully yourself.",2015-01-16T18:23:17+0000

New passenger car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 5.7 percent in the European Union last year, reaching about 12.6 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association reported from Brussels. It was the first annual expansion since 2007, when the market peaked at nearly 16 million new passenger cars. Spain led the major national markets in 2014, with government trade-in incentives helping to lift sales by more than 18 percent. Germany, Europes largest auto market, grew 2.9 percent. Still, the industry is not out of danger. The stagnant economy in most of Europe, as well as crushing unemployment in countries like Greece and Spain, will continue to weigh on the market. LMC Automotive, a market research firm, estimates that European sales will gain just 1.1 percent in 2015. Carlos Da Silva, who follows Europes car market at IHS Automotive, said in a research note that the 2014 recovery was welcome news, but that Europe was not yet a fully cured patient.

In Kano State, in northern Nigeria, an unspecified number of birds showing a high mortality rate were culled from a poultry farm. In both cases, blood samples tested positive for an H5 strain of avian influenza, officials quoted by Nigerian news media said. It was not immediately clear whether the birds were afflicted with H5N1, which is highly pathogenic and can infect humans. H5N1 first spread from Asia to Europe and Africa in the late 1990s and is a recurrent problem in domesticated bird populations.

Lancelot Thwaytes sued Sothebys for 11 million (about $16.7 million) in damages, claiming that the auctioneers had insufficiently researched his painting The Cardsharps. The auction house described the work, below, which depicts two hustlers trying to cheat another man in a card game, as a 17th-century copy of the original by the Italian master Caravaggio. The painting was purchased by a friend of the British collector Denis Mahon, who died in 2011 and who, after further analysis, declared it an authentic Caravaggio and valued the painting at 10 million. The Financial Times reported that Judge Vivien Rose dismissed Mr. Thwaytess claim, saying in her ruling that the auctioneers had examined the painting thoroughly, and reasonably concluded that the painting was not of high enough quality to be a Caravaggio.

(TMC) STARRING SIDNEY POITIER Stanley Kramers The Defiant Ones (1958), about an uneducated black convict on a chain gang who goes on the lam with his other half, a white Southern bigot portrayed by Tony Curtis, above left, ushers in this tribute to Mr. Poitier, right (between them is Cara Williams). In 1964, Mr. Poitier became the first black person to win a best-actor Oscar and three years later was the nations top box-office draw. In its candid presentment of racial conflict and resentment, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, it rips right into the subject with clawing ferocity and flails it about with merciless fury until all the viciousness in conflict is spent. In James Clavells To Sir, With Love (1967), at 10, Mr. Poitier stars as Thackeray, an idealistic new teacher in London assigned to a school near the citys docks, where his Cockney-accented students are ill mannered and insolent. Christian Roberts plays Denham, the arrogant teenager who incites Thackerays latest classroom edict: If the students want to be treated as the adults they are about to become, they must act like adults. A nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek, Mr. Crowther wrote. And in Mr. Kramers Guess Whos Coming to Dinner (1967), at midnight, the liberal principles of an aging couple (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) are tested when their daughter (Katharine Houghton) announces her engagement to a black doctor (Mr. Poitier). Mr. Crowther called the movie a most delightfully acted and gracefully entertaining film, fashioned much in the manner of a stage drawing-room comedy, that seems to be about something much more serious and challenging than it actually is.",2015-01-19T06:00:10+0000

Among the dead was the father of the Nobel Peace laureate Rigoberta Mench; he was a member of an indigenous group that seized the embassy to protest the militarys brutal campaign against Indian villages as part of its battle against leftist rebels. The three-judge tribunal ruled that the official, Pedro Garca Arredondo, 70, the leader of a special police investigative unit, cut off negotiations, ordered officers to attack the embassy and prevented anyone from leaving after the fire broke out. The cause of the fire has never been determined. Mr. Garca was sentenced to 90 years in prison for his actions in the embassy fire and the killing of two students at a subsequent mass funeral. He is already serving a 70-year prison sentence for his role in the 1981 disappearance of a student leader. ",2015-01-20T02:55:23+0000

The business, Bi-County Distributors, was initially targeted because of a pattern of cash deposits under $10,000, but its owners, the Hirsch family, argued that the deposits were legitimate and, though more than two years passed after the money was seized, no criminal charges were filed. Lawyers from the Institute for Justice filed a motion demanding the return of the money. In the resulting settlement, neither side in the case admitted wrongdoing. Last Friday, the outgoing Attorney General, Eric H. Holder Jr., announced a policy change to rein in federal participation in civil asset forfeiture. ",2015-01-21T01:21:19+0000

His power grab on immigration also seems to have been a limited political success: The move was broadly unpopular but neither immigration nor executive power are top-of-mind issues for most voters, the presidents standing with Hispanics has clearly improved, a brief period of media chiding soon gave way (predictably) to media forgetfulness, and the Republican opposition has been (also predictably) divided and disorganized. And on foreign policy, while the days of presidential rhetoric about allegedly ending wars and routing Al Qaeda are over, there hasnt been a return to the crisis atmosphere of last spring and summer, giving the president breathing room to claim (plausibly in the case of Russia, less so in the case of ISIS) that his strategies are working.",2015-01-21T16:08:07+0000

He realizes reality must win in the end, although the fact that the scene that symbolizes this  his ex-wife shooting Bogart in the chest  is itself a re-enactment of a scene from They Drive by Night tells you something about the elasticity of the medium, which, like Eschers eternal stairwell, feeds even our dreams of escape from the movies. We all agree with Allen, on some level. A life lived at a constant pitch of screwball comedy is a recipe for exhaustion. The relationship of most movie couples would not last five minutes beyond the closing credits of the films in which they appear.

Im still catching up with Blu-ray as a video technology. But now Decca has issued some classic opera recordings from its catalog remastered from the original tapes in what is called Blu-ray Pure Audio. Im loath to apply the word pure to anything. Still, listening to this reissue of the landmark 1972 recording of Puccinis Turandot, with the dynamic Zubin Mehta conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and a dream cast headed by Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti, I have to say the sound quality is clean, vivid and strikingly detailed. Ms. Sutherland, the reigning bel canto soprano of her day, was tempted into the studio to sing Turandot, a vocally weighty role she never performed in a house. Her voice is gleaming and penetrating, and Mr. Mehta draws surprising intensity from an artist who could be stolid. Mr. Pavarotti is in his prime as Calaf.

(Encore) BLUE JASMINE (2013) Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her role as Jasmine French, a Park Avenue matron fallen on hard times after her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), lands in prison for bilking his clients out of millions, leaving her with little more than her pearls, white Chanel jacket, Herms bag and monogrammed Louis Vuitton luggage. Destitute, in a manner of speaking, Jasmine flies first-class to San Francisco to begin life anew with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), whose scrappy existence and brutish men (Andrew Dice Clay and Bobby Cannavale) Jasmine can barely stomach without self-medicating with vodka and Xanax. Then she meets a diplomatic type (Peter Sarsgaard) with an appreciation for her decorating talents and designer threads and starts to see light at the end of her dark tunnel. With intimations of Ruth Madoff and Blanche DuBois, this shattered woman is brilliantly brought to quivering life by Ms. Blanchett, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, in Woody Allens most sustained, satisfying and resonant film since Match Point.

She had come to Marcuss offices in Midtown Manhattan from a cloistered community in Borough Park, Brooklyn, because she had been recoiling from sex with her husband. There was pain, and, more problematic for Marcus, there was no desire. The pain, Marcus and her staff deduced right away, was a result of muscle constrictions stemming from childbirth; this could be treated effectively with dilators  and without objection from the patients rabbi. But the deeper aversion was more complex. Talking with the woman at a round table in a room decorated with still lifes of pears and berries, Marcus wrote a list of ways that the patient and her husband could make sex, for her, more appealing.",2015-01-22T14:00:39+0000

Although Paderewski was speaking not as a musician but as a Pole in the service of his nation, and although the voice of an aged man still weak from illness could not develop those crescendos that have never failed to thrill listeners as his long delicate fingers hit the keyboard, the nobility of his ideas and the dramatic turn of his phrases made the speech a series of forensic fortissimos. In the awareness that he might not live to see again the state of which he had the honor to be the first President, Paderewski stamped this discourse as the last will and testament to Poland of one of its servants.

That was womens fiction, I suppose, Hawkins told NPR in a recent interview. Much more lighthearted, not so much killing. . . . I did enjoy writing them, but they kept getting darker and darker. And once I started writing this book I knew this was what I was supposed to be doing. It just felt completely right for me. This sounds awful, but Im not, you know, a joyful, romantic person. Well, I can be, but Ive got a proper dark side and I enjoy indulging it. Shes not kidding: The Girl on the Train is about an alcoholic commuter, fired from her job, who spins an obsessive fantasy about a couple along her train route and who may know something about the wifes disappearance. (Comparisons to Gone Girl are not misplaced.)

The next, she was the proud mother of her first child, who was nicknamed BBBB in the hospital, for Big Baby Boy Bogue (her husbands last name). This would hardly be considered extraordinary if it werent for the fact that she had recently been named the companys C.E.O. Female chief executives typically live in glass boxes where every move they make is held up for intense public scrutiny, and most get themselves there through brutal amounts of work and by avoiding anything that draws attention to the fact that theyre women. Yet right after starting her job running a troubled $30 billion technology giant, Mayer announced that she would be taking a maternity leave, albeit a stunningly short one. (She took two weeks.) The audacity of the move  accepting a top executive job knowing that she was five months pregnant and then taking so little time off  prompted an Internet outcry (The Pregnant C.E.O.: Should You Hate Marissa Mayer? Forbes asked in one representative example), in which even progressives grumbled about the privilege involved, including Mayers household staff and in-office nursery. And so it was that her upsetting of the womens-issues industrial complex became all that most people know about Mayer. Yet there is much more to the picture. ",2015-01-23T17:13:16+0000

us,When Mango Mania Was Revolutionary ,"In 1968, two years after he began the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong wrested it from the hands of avid but unruly students and handed it over to a more worshipful working class. During the transition, he happened to receive, as an ambassadorial gift from Pakistan, a basket of fresh mangoes. And as a symbolic act of largess, he had the exotic fruit delivered to a group of workers. In doing so, he created an instant cult. Not only was the fruit not eaten, but it was also revered as an emblem of the leaders godlike love. The mangoes were preserved and became objects of worship. Wax and plastic duplicates were created and enshrined. Mango madness pervaded the culture: Images of the yellow fruit appeared in posters, on porcelain and in textile designs. Maos Golden Mangoes and the Cultural Revolution, a China Institute exhibition organized by the art historian Alfreda Murck, perfectly captures the devotional fervor of that moment. And a mere moment it was. Within a year, the fad was over. Mango memorabilia went into closets and then to flea markets, from which Ms. Murck, who lived many years in Beijing, rescued choice examples to tell this fascinating tale of consumerist infatuation.

Its an extraordinary number driven by audience demand and a willingness to pay high ticket prices of up to $425, an amount that few plays have charged before. Plays with popular stars (Bradley Cooper in The Elephant Man, Bryan Cranston in All the Way) often have advance sales of several million dollars, while even many musicals  which tend to be bigger sellers than plays  often struggle to build an eight-figure advance. A spokesman for the plays lead producer, Scott Rudin, confirmed the figure on Sunday. It beats the previous record for a play, $13.05 million for the 2013 revival of Harold Pinters Betrayal, another Rudin production, starring the real-life couple Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz. Mr. David (above) is widely known as the star of HBOs Curb Your Enthusiasm and co-creator and head writer of Seinfeld. He is both the author and star of Fish in the Dark, his first play, a comedy about a death in the family. Fish in the Dark, directed by Anna D.

(TCM) DIRECTED BY LUIS BUUEL This five-film tribute to Buuel (1900-1983), known as the father of Surrealist cinema, begins with Belle de Jour (1968), starring Catherine Deneuve (above right, with Genevive Page) as a frigid young housewife able to achieve sexual satisfaction only after becoming a prostitute. Writing in The New York Times, Renata Adler called Belle de Jour a really beautiful movie, and somehow, letting the color in  this is Buuels first color film  has changed the emotional quality of his obsessions in a completely unpredictable way. In The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), an Oscar-winner for best foreign film, at 10, six upwardly mobile friends try to have dinner together  but find they cant. In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted, Vincent Canby wrote, The Discreet Charm moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buuels experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis. The lineup continues with Diary of a Chambermaid (1964), an adaptation of the novel by Octave Mirbeau about the foibles and hypocrisy of the landed gentry as seen through the eyes of a worldly domestic (Jeanne Moreau), at midnight; Viridiana (1962), in which a young nun (Silvia Pinal) tries to help the poor after inheriting a fortune, at 2 a.m.; and The Exterminating Angel (1962), where guests at a lavish dinner party in an elegant home in Mexico City find themselves unable to leave the parlor for several days, during which the social order begins to break down, at 3:45.",2015-01-26T05:29:07+0000

I grew up in the Boston suburbs, rooted for the Patriots as a kid and even possessed vague memories of watching the team play at Fenway Park, one of their homes before they settled into the nowhereland of Foxborough, Mass., in 1971. My friend Josh and I once wrote a letter to the teams young quarterback, Jim Plunkett, inviting him to dinner at Joshs house. (Plunkett never responded.) Their teams were mostly bad, their owner was an embarrassment, their stadium a dump. Yet the Patriots always retained a lovable haplessness about them, with their cute minuteman logos, their A.F.L. lineage and the identity crisis that comes from being named after an entire region instead of a city or state.

And the slick plastic made a comeback in the fall/winter mens collections last week, giving an alluring, glossy finish to some of the looks. Calvin Kleins  Italo Zucchelli deployed the fabric  in both gray and black  in a range of familiar mens silhouettes including baggy trousers, parkas, and shrunken pilot jackets. The model wearing a structured black PVC raincoat in Raf Simonss recent collection proved that the shiny material can seem approachable when worn as part of a monochromatic look. And for his first appearance on the Paris fashion calendar, Stphane Ashpool orchestrated a theatrical presentation inside a classic opera house for his street-wear-cum-high-fashion brand Pigalle.

The actors, both 43, have become synonymous with the kind of quirky indie fare that has come to epitomize Sundance over the years: Ryder, as the breakout star of Beetlejuice and with her roles in the cult films Heathers and Edward Scissorhands in the late 80s and early 90s; and Sarsgaard with celebrated turns in the Sundance films The Dying Gaul, An Education and Garden State, among others. This week, they star alongside one another for the first time in Experimenter, the director Michael Almereydas drama about the social psychologist Stanley Milgram and his controversial experiments on obedience in the 1960s. Its a peculiar film  as Milgram, Sarsgaard routinely breaks the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera; at several points an elephant appears from seemingly nowhere to hint at the deeper meaning behind Milgrams experiments  and yet it never crumbles under its own weight, thanks to the steady talents of Sarsgaard and Ryder, who plays Milgrams wife, Sasha.

The military views with great severity any attempt to elude mandatory military service especially when the act is intended to make a political statement, its statement said.

The planes landed in Dnipropetrovsk, outside the area where pro-Russian separatists are battling the Ukrainian military. The assistance is being delivered by a coalition including Unicef, Save the Children, the World Food Program and People in Need, and is part of more than $53 million in aid pledged by European Union countries. The effort contrasted sharply with Russias unilateral dispatch of convoys to eastern Ukraine in recent months, which drew criticism from the Ukrainian government and the Red Cross over a lack of inspections and participation of international groups. We have not forgotten the population of Ukraine, said Christos Stylianides, the European commissioner for humanitarian assistance, who oversaw the planes arrival. Were in there big time, he added.

Ms. Martin-Daihirou called the step a last resort to ensure we can continue providing lifesaving support to the 150,000 refugees, nearly half of all refugees receiving the agencys assistance in Uganda. Their arrival predated the December 2013 outbreak of fighting in South Sudan, which caused a flight of 138,000 South Sudanese to Uganda, who are not affected by the cuts. The agencys recurrent funding problems have forced it to cut or halt food-aid distribution.

us,Yasmina Rezas Happy Are the Happy,"Like a handful of the 18 people who populate her latest novel, Happy Are the Happy, Yasmina Reza is formidably accomplished. A prolific novelist and playwright  two of her works for the stage, Art and God of Carnage, won Tony Awards for best play  as well as a screenwriter and actress, she haunts the halls of power in her native France. Happy Are the Happy is another coup, a quick and delicate book thats as funny as it is humane. Each of its short chapters, titled with the name of the character speaking, is told in the first person and concerns, for the most part, other characters in the book soon to introduce themselves if they havent already. Everyone gets a word in, and the style is feathery as gossip. Characters chime with one another in ways they never realize, a conviviality that is bittersweet. Their voices are self-aware, a little jaundiced, vulnerable, sometimes plaintive, and entirely authentic. Accomplishment, Reza suggests, is no hedge against yearning or regret. Status, wealth, celebrity, sex appeal and good health are unevenly distributed and underappreciated, until they are in decline. Life isnt sparkly, its a slog: People, practically oldsters, lurching around Paris, bearing their lives. Perhaps chasing the impractical is simply a way to stay in motion.",2015-01-28T13:00:23+0000

(13, 49) GRANTCHESTER James Norton (Happy Valley), above, portrays Sidney Chambers, a small-town vicar with a love of jazz, whiskey and complicated women who discovers an enthusiasm for sleuthing after a concerned parishioner compels him to investigate a grisly suicide in this new Masterpiece Mystery! series, based on the mysteries by James Runcie. Grantchester will be breezy fun for fans of the form, though the more discerning will be put off by how rudimentary the actual murder mysteries are after being squeezed into 50 minutes (half the norm for this type of show), Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times about what he called cozy mysteries. And while it benefits from the presence of the veteran Robson Green (Wire in the Blood, Touching Evil) as Sidneys sidekick, Inspector Keating, Mr. Hale added, he found Mr. Norton, though amiable and good to look at, a little dim: As religiously inclined young British sleuths go  and I apologize for a reference that only my fellow British-mystery zealots will understand  hes no Hathaway. In Downton Abbey, which leads in at 9, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and Lord Gillingham (Tom Cullen) check into a Liverpool hotel  the better to check out their love.

After his 1955 performance Challenging Mud, in which the artist wrestled a mixture of cement, gravel, clay, plaster, pebbles and twigs into a formless form, Shiraga devised an entirely new painting technique. From 1959 onward, he suspended himself from his studio ceiling and manipulated the paint exclusively with his ten toes to create a range of textures from the slinky and supple to the protruding and violent. Almost 60 years later, Shiraga, whose dynamic contributions blend painting and performance, is still a misunderstood radical who is only now receiving the sort of American institutional and gallery attention that properly contextualizes the depth and reach of his practice.",2015-01-28T22:25:20+0000

The idea was to have a space that combines art and fashion and design in a way that is sort of un-self-conscious and natural. Krakoffs well-documented affinity for art and design informed many other elements of the marble-floored interior: Also present are an opalescent table by Mattia Bonetti, which Krakoff says reads almost like a sculpture; a custom Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec Clouds installation rendered in felt, one of Krakoffs favorite materials; and a wall installation of chairs created by Krakoff and his wife Delphine that was originally exhibited at Salon 94 and will double as shelving for merchandise.

Fullers new book describes the collapse of her marriage, and in a recent interview with the Times reporter Penelope Green she bristled at the idea that she would have shown a draft to her ex-husband. Theres almost this expectation you need to get approval, she said. I doubt Ernest Hemingway was asked what his ex-wives thought of his writing. I think women have to stop asking for permission. She didnt say, though, whether she had shared the memoir with her children, who are 21, 17 and 9. So I asked. Theres a very fine line, she said by phone from Washington, D.C., where she was on book tour, between protecting your children, as you should, and smothering them to the point that they dont know whats going down in the world. She had offered to show relevant passages to her older two, and Sarah, the 21-year-old, took her up on it. Shes a fantastic writer in her own way, Fuller said. At the same time I was working on this book, she wrote an essay about the divorce for her student magazine. It was so poignant. My ex-husband read it and said, Thats not what happened. But of course it was totally from her perspective. Its another prism. Were reading each others stuff now not just as people who were personally involved, but as writers able to appreciate each others talent. And her 17-year-old son? Fuller laughed. He has better boundaries than anyone I know. He said, Mum, I lived it. I dont need to read it.",2015-01-30T17:20:30+0000

So far as Britain is concerned, we are likely to recall that Admiral Nelson won a great victory in 1805 at Trafalgar, off the coast of Spain, and was mortally wounded during the battle. In words that became famous, he had signaled to his fleet, England expects that every man will do his duty. We are likelier to remember the Duke of Wellingtons triumph at Waterloo 10 years later, which ended Napoleons sensational career. A comment Wellington supposedly made afterward is also frequently quoted, that the engagement had been a damned close-run thing. And as a sidelight to the international conflict there was our own American War of 1812, during which Francis Scott Key was inspired to write his verses about the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air.

To the limited scope of a window frame, the former London journalist Paula Hawkins, in her debut thriller, The Girl on the Train, offers a few additional obfuscations. First, her novels protagonist, Rachel, looks out through the window of a moving train on her daily commute. Second, Rachel is your basic hot mess: depressed, unemployed, still in mourning for the death of her marriage and prone to alcoholic blackouts that coincide with critical moments in the tale of a missing woman later found dead.

In this new world they began with nothing, worked hard and achieved much. As is often true of successful immigrant families, their grandchildren could live as though the old world had never been. Cohens father became a doctor, his mother was college educated. Both were raised with the comforts that only numerous servants can provide: They never had to boil an egg, Cohen writes.

How do writers of one race or ethnicity write about people of another race or ethnicity?

Bill Chengs Southern Cross the Dog and Louise Erdrichs The Round House come to mind. Others fail: At one point in Kathryn Stocketts The Help, a black woman compares her skin color with that of a cockroach.

The next day when a friend asked Adam if he had sex with the woman, he lied in the traditional manner of boastful, insecure young men everywhere and said that he had, without a condom. You could have AIDS, the friend said. That wasnt true  or was, at most, exceedingly unlikely. Nevertheless, the idea lodged in Adams mind, where it set about establishing permanent residency. By the following summer, the fear that he might already have AIDS, or would someday contract it, had hijacked his brain. The snowflake of a single intrusive thought, as he puts it, had become a blizzard that blew the snow into every corner of my mind, and laid down a blanket that muffled every surface. For the next 20 years, Adam was consumed by the fear that he had contracted, or would contract, H.I.V.: He called the National AIDS Helpline so many times daily that the half-dozen staffers there came to recognize his voice; he got blood tests; he compulsively examined and re-examined every red stain he ever came across to determine whether it might be AIDS-tainted blood, and whether it might somehow have contaminated him.

She meets her match when she strikes up a friendship with Jake (Jason Sudeikis), a good-natured womanizer who just happens to have taken her virginity 12 years earlier. At the premiere, Headland described the film as When Harry Met Sally for jerks (though she used a slightly stronger word), which is to say that, like the directors previous effort, Bachelorette, it is more than a little naughty and twisted (and, it follows, a perfect starring vehicle for Brie). The 32-year-old L.A. native has been stealing scenes for the better part of a decade playing type-A characters on Mad Men and Community, and she viewed Headlands film  and its many sex scenes  as an opportunity to try out a new direction.

Our aircraft intercepted and it did not follow orders and, well, it was disabled, he said, adding that the encounter took place over Venezuelas territorial waters.

Officials in Aruba said that body parts and about 400 packages that appeared to contain drugs were found in the wreckage.
