us,Reagan in the Woodshed,"Look into the crystal ball. 1. An independent counsel will be appointed. After a decent investigative interval to demonstrate that the Justice Department is a professional organization, Attorney General Ed Meese will announce that evidence of enough wrongdoing has been uncovered, at a high enough level, to justify asking the courts to appoint a special prosecutor. 2. The President will appoint a prestigious and mediagenic chief of staff to replace the embattled Don Regan. Paul Laxalt and Howard Baker spring to mind; Drew Lewis might have problems with the acid-rain matters in the concurrent Deaver investigation. Timed to follow quickly on the naming of independent counsel, and coupled with the announcement of a new national security adviser to replace the scuttled Poindexter, this will give the President the appearance of contrition implied by a fresh start. 3. Fresh revelations by hard-digging reporters will give the scandal new impetus. The subject has achieved liftoff, and a bloodlust is in the air; during December, every major media organization will compete to get credit for the triumph over another secrecy-bedeviled White House. The Pulitzer Prize cannot be awarded to the Syrian press that first broke the arms-sales story. 4. The Democratic Senate will appoint its select committee in January. Televised hearings will create new household names; Daniel Moynihan, shunted aside in committee-chairman assignments so far, has made his bid for chairmanship with his ''Administration is tottering'' judgment; Democratic club members are pushing Sam Nunn, but Joe Biden's supporters see this as their dark horse's ticket to the White House. 5.",1986-12-01T05:00:00+0000

If the faucet is solid brass, you should be able to polish it to a bright luster. If it is just brass-plated, then I'm afraid you are out of luck.

us,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,"Evan Parker Trio and Hamiett Bluiett, Washington Square Church, 135 West Fourth Street (362-3366). Each in his own way, the American baritone saxophonist Hamiett Bluiett and the British soprano saxophonist Evan Parker have pushed their instruments beyond ordinary capabilities. Both can make extraordinary sounds - honks, squeaks, clicks, sighs, bleats - but they're not just sonic daredevils; they use their extended techniques in far-reaching but coherent improvisations. Mr. Bluiett, a member of the World Saxophone Quartet, is steeped in jazz and rhythm-and-blues; he'll play solos that are likely to use his cavernous bottom register as well as flights into territory usually claimed by piccolo players. Mr. Parker, who is making a rare New York appearance, is a British ''free'' improviser who determinedly avoids references to fixed traditions in favor of a thoughtful but spontaneous succession of sounds. He'll be leading a trio with a bassist and a percussionist. Tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $10.",1986-12-05T05:00:00+0000

us,OPERA: NEW 'FLEDERMAUS' AT THE MET,"ABOUT halfway through the first act of the Metropolitan Opera's new production of ''Die Fledermaus'' it became painfully clear that the most generous approach to the remainder of the evening would be to look for bright spots amid the gloom. Yes, Kiri Te Kanawa was doing her best on Thursday night to frolic about as Rosalinde, and her buttery tones at times almost made one overlook the fact that she was miscast as that madcap lady. And yes, Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's lavishly realistic sets were just the spectacular sort that bring Pavlovian oohs and aahs from Metropolitan audiences. But such bright spots, if they can be called that, became increasingly difficult to find as this evening wore on. Otto Schenk, who both directed and took the speaking role of the drunken jailer Frosch, accomplished what any admirer of this queen of operettas might think impossible: he made ''Fledermaus,'' a masterpiece of blithe charm, into a bore of serious proportions.",1986-12-05T05:00:00+0000

Yes, Kiri Te Kanawa was doing her best on Thursday night to frolic about as Rosalinde, and her buttery tones at times almost made one overlook the fact that she was miscast as that madcap lady. And yes, Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's lavishly realistic sets were just the spectacular sort that bring Pavlovian oohs and aahs from Metropolitan audiences. But such bright spots, if they can be called that, became increasingly difficult to find as this evening wore on. Otto Schenk, who both directed and took the speaking role of the jailer Frosch, accomplished what any admirer of this queen of operettas might think impossible: he made ''Fledermaus,'' a masterpiece of blithe charm, into a bore of serious proportions.",1986-12-06T05:00:00+0000

However you read the story of Noah and the ark - as fact or as fable - you should take delight in this gallery of dignified and playful animal portraits. Best known in this country for his illustrated books on gnomes, the Dutch artist Rien Poortvliet here turns his eye to the less fanciful, if no less amazing, creatures that share the planet with us. Owls and elephants, warthogs and ladybugs, cows and crocodiles, the beasts rub shoulders on these pages as they might have rubbed shoulders in the ark. The inwardness of creation stares back at us from their eyes. Their colors are autumnal - russet of fox and gold of lion - but the spirit of the book is springlike, celebrating the inventiveness of nature. Mr. Poortvliet muses on Noah, to be sure, yet in his images and brief accompanying notes he is more deeply captivated by Noah's passengers. ''I cannot imagine life without animals,'' he writes. The effect of ''Noah's Ark'' is to make it harder for us, as well, to imagine life without animals. Knowing how many species have vanished during our reign and how many are endangered, one comes away from this tender and spirited book feeling that Earth itself is now the ark, and that we two-legged beings are both creators of the flood and custodians of the flock.

She has as much fun as possible, but what she means by this phrase cannot be understood without making an adjustment, an allowance for the great gulf across which this phrase must travel before it reaches us. It comes from another world, which, like the stars that originally sent out the light we see hesitating in the sky above us these nights, may be or is already gone. It is possible to reconstruct the facts of this world - the furniture, the clothing, the ornaments on the mantelpiece, the jugs and basins and even the chamber pots in the bedrooms, but not the emotions, not with the same exactness. So much that is now known and felt must be excluded. . . . Life was more joyful and innocent then, and at the same time permeated with guilt and terror, or at least the occasions for them, on the most daily level.

Zumberge said he made the decision with the athletic director, Mike McGee. McGee said a search committee for a new coach had been formed and said one will be named ''as quickly as possible.'' Although U.S.C. posted a 7-4 record and earned a bowl berth, the season was tarnished when the Trojans were trounced by U.C.L.A, then blew a 17-point fourth-quarter lead and lost to Notre Dame the following week. The 46-year-old Tollner, who replaced John Robinson in 1983, had a 26-19-1 mark in four seasons, with trips to the Rose and Aloha bowls. But he was 1-7 against U.C.L.A. and Notre Dame. Tollner was named U.S.C.'s 18th coach in November 1982 after serving nine months as offensive coordinator and running back coach.. . . Another West Coast head-coaching job was filled when Bruce Snyder, who coaches running backs for the Los Angeles Rams, was chosen as the new football coach at the University of California, replacing Joe Kapp, who was dismissed last month.",1986-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Written by Lucille Fletcher -who, if she is fortunate, will be remembered for the radio play, ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' - it's an attempt to carry off an American version of a British specialty: sneaky goings-on in a houseful of suspects. Sorry, wrong number. This being New York, the premises are a fancy apartment in Kips Bay, from which one can see into an abandoned tenement. Did Elaine Wheeler really see a body or two there, or is she, as her husband, John, and her best friend, Blanche, apparently believe, going cuckoo? But can John and Blanche, who are having an affair, be trusted? Blanche is the sort of woman who wears a black negligee. Are they trying to spirit Elaine off to a clinic in Switzerland so they can commit hanky-panky on her money? (Elaine is an heiress.) What are those pills they keep feeding her? (Blanche is a nurse.) Is somebody trying to drive Elaine even battier by reminding her of an accident eight years before in which her first husband was killed, along with his 20-year-old blond mistress?",1986-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.How do antiseptics kill bacteria and which are the most effective? A.The three most widely used antiseptics are alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and iodine, according to Dr. David Govaker of the Truman Medical Center East in Kansas City, Mo. Alcohol melts away the fat and protein layers of the bacteria cell membrane, killing the cell. Hydrogen peroxide bubbles when an enzyme peroxidase in the bacteria breaks down the hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The bubbling dislodges the bacteria so it can be washed away. Like alcohol, iodine dissolves the cell membrane but it is much more powerful. Dr. Govaker said iodine is the safest and most effective antiseptic. Three drops will sterilize a quart of water. All three antiseptics will prevent infection of minor scrapes and bruises, Dr. Govaker said, but the best first aid is to wash the wound with soap and water twice a day. QHow is paternity determined and with what degree of accuracy? A.Paternity is established by comparing inherited characteristics of blood cells from the father, mother and child. For example, the membranes of white blood cells contain surface proteins known as antigens. Unrelated persons almost never have the same type of antigen, according to Dr. Wilma Bias, director of immunogenetics at The John Hopkins University School of Medicine. The most accurate paternity test uses antigens on white blood cells called leucocytes. On average, the test can rule out 90 percent or more of men as a child's father.",1986-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Bromberg's real-life father, the actor J. Edward Bromberg, was a McCarthy-era victim who died at age 47 of heart disease, not long after the Hollywood blacklist had destroyed his career. How does a child settle scores with the ghost of such a famous father without appearing to aid and abet the witchhunters who unjustly hounded him to the grave? The solution on view at the Ensemble Studio Theater isn't satisfactory. If Conrad Bromberg avoids sullying his father's memory in this autobiographical drama, he does so at the price of neglecting the very issues he intended to address.",1986-12-12T05:00:00+0000

(An alternate cast performed the opera Thursday and will repeat it this afternoon.) The best showing Friday was made by Young Ok Shin as Susanna. She has a clear, pretty voice, intelligible diction, and confidence of manner -though here the manner was all too readily that of the standard too-cute soubrette; that is where better guidance could have helped. Elmore James sang with generally good, uncomplicated tone as Figaro, and had the germ of a dramatic grasp on the role at certain key moments. The others - Jose Garcia, Peiwen Chao, Yanyu Guo, Daniel Colanero, Jeffrey Morrissey, Ana-Gloria Vazquez and Mi-Hae Park - all stand to benefit from further training in fine points and in some basics, though several clearly show promise.",1986-12-14T05:00:00+0000

(The name stuck, though not in a pejorative sense). The new museum represents this period with must pieces that everyone knows. Greater human statements than Gustave Courbet's ''Studio'' and Paul Cezanne's ''Woman With Coffee-Pot'' would be hard to find. It also covers the period in terms of not-so-great painting that not everyone knows, and of the architecture, the furniture, the household objects, the photographs, the jewelry and many another auxiliary domain. It reminds us of the cardinal dates, artistic and political, and it makes frontier raids on the social history of the times.

He fails to note that the majority of CFC's are probably produced and used here, for air conditioning, refrigeration, sterilizing medical supplies, etc., and that a United States ban in itself would be a tremendous step toward solving the increasingly ominous ozone-depletion problem.

I had been based in New Delhi for some time and, feeling full of India and myself, went in one day to talk to the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, a man I admired a great deal. Smart and sassy, I asked him a question about a very sensitive subject, India's occupation of Kashmir. I wanted to goad him a little and I succeeded; it didn't take much, this man of intellect and power was a sensitive fellow. He looked at me, jumped up, smacked his bald pate in magnificent irritation and shouted, ''Rosenthal, you have been in this country for four years and you have not learned one damned thing yet!''",1986-12-14T05:00:00+0000
us,PICKING UP WHERE CHEKHOV LEFT OFF,"No one knows what Anton Chekhov called the long, cluttered but precociously talented play that, remodeled by the British dramatist Michael Frayn and titled ''Wild Honey,'' arrives at the Virginia Theater on Thursday. No one can even be sure when he wrote it. Maybe it was in 1878, when he was 18 and still a restless schoolboy in rural Taganrog. More probably it was in 1881, when he was a full-time medical student at Moscow University and a part-time contributor of comic sketches and articles to the humorous magazines. But whatever his and his play's respective ages, one thing seems certain. Chekhov came very rapidly to accept that he'd written a mess, muddle and unstageable fiasco, a strong candidate for theatrical oblivion. It was certainly the very last piece to celebrate its centenary as ''Wild Honey,'' with Ian McKellen in the lead, has in fact been celebrating it: by triumphing in London and coming in search of a similar success to the New World.",1986-12-14T05:00:00+0000

I want to stay at the Golden Lemon on St. Kitts, but the cost of the regular air fare is keeping me away. - J. M. D., New York Answer:A possible solution is to ask a travel agent to book the hotel and to ask an airline to issue an I.T.X., or inclusive tour excursion, fare. That fare, which is ostensibly linked to the purchase of accommodations as part of a package plan, is lower than regular fares and competitive with the fares that wholesalers buy for their group tours. According to travel agents, they can sometimes obtain an I.T.X. fare even if the passenger has booked a hotel that does not figure in package arrangements. The round-trip I.T.X. fare from New York to St. Kitts during the winter, high season is $485 on weekends and $429 midweek. The regular fare the year round is $598.",1986-12-14T05:00:00+0000

In keeping with his writing habits of four decades, the author of ''The Trip to Bountiful'' and ''Tender Mercies'' whisks us into the fictional small Texas town of Harrison and sets his characters about their diurnal business.

Francie is ''a remarkable heroine'' and her father ''becomes, with Louise Meriwether's skillful handling, a figure of heroic proportions,'' Paule Marshall said in The Book Review in 1970. ''The novel's greatest achievement lies in the strong sense of black life that it conveys; the vitality and force behind the despair.'' AN OMELETTE AND A GLASS OF WINE, by Elizabeth David. (Penguin, $8.95.) The English author Eliza-beth David is believed by many to be the most impor tant living writer on food, our reviewer, Charles Rosen, said last year. Her position, he added, is confirmed with the appearance of this collection of her food writing over the previous 35 years.

But Senator Bob Dole said the President had not yet convinced the public that he had done all he could to get at the truth. #1 Panama companies are used as foils, enabling their foreign owners to do business anywhere in the world anonymously and tax-free. Three such companies were linked to the Iran arms deals last week. #20 Triad America may be near collapse. The Utah-based investment corporation is owned by Adnan M. Khashoggi, the Saudi businessman who played a key role in financing the American arms sales to Iran. #20 Andrei D. Sakharov, in an interview, said he planned to continue advocating human rights when he returns to Moscow after nearly seven years of internal exile. He said he made no promise to curb his public activities. #1 A more flexible human rights policy in the Soviet Union and an acknowledgment that treatment of dissidents affects other issues are reflected in the decision to let Dr. Sakharov return to Moscow, Western diplomats said. #14 A jailed Soviet dissident's notes, reportedly smuggled out of the country, say that he has been in solitary confinement for almost three years and and a hunger strike for more than two years.",1986-12-21T05:00:00+0000

When rock first began to shake, rattle and roll its way across the American consciousness, we children of the 1950's were told that it was at best a freakish fad - the musical equivalent of the Hula-Hoop or Davy Crockett's coonskin cap. At worst, it was the sound of the civilized social fabric unraveling.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE BUTCHER'S WIFE. By Li Ang. Translated by Howard Goldblatt and Ellen Yeung. (North Point, $14.95.) In Taiwan this first novel by Li Ang won a major literary award in 1983 and outraged a number of critics and government officials who considered it little more than pornography. ''The Butcher's Wife'' is not pornographic, but it omits few details or four-letter words in describing the brutalization of young Lin Shi by her much older husband, Chen Jiangshui, who treats her like the pigs he butchers in his slaughterhouse. Based on a homicide in Shanghai in the 1930's, the novel begins with two fictional press accounts of Lin Shi's harrowing murder of her husband. These reports are dismissive of her motives, but in the ensuing story of her life before the killing, in the small superstitious town of Lucheng, the author is wholly sympathetic to Lin Shi. Her fate, meant to be both shockingly singular and representative of oppressed women, is certainly among the most pathetic in recent world literature. Orphaned at 9, Lin Shi is forced to live with her unscrupulous uncle until he marries her off at 20 to Chen Jiangshui. His numbing mistreatment of her begins on their wedding night and escalates until the moment of her impulsive revenge. The story is simple, uncluttered and powerful in its way but is undermined by its repetitious scenes of sexual violence. Lin Shi is such a naive, defenseless victim and Chen Jiangshui such a vicious, unmotivated monster that our interest eventually wanes.",1986-12-28T05:00:00+0000

''But the subject itself deserves this: Mr. Scammell has to deal with war, revolution, prison camps, Khrushchev's literary politics and Solzhenitsyn's eventual exile in the West.'' The book is well-written, he said, and the author had the advantage of several interviews with his subject. The work ''puts us all in its debt.'' SELECTED POEMS, by John Ashbery. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $9.95.) The effect of reading John Ashbery's poetry, Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Times last year, is ''not unlike that produced by listening to a piece of avant-garde music,'' and his work ''frequently defies conventional attempts to impute meaning.'' Yet, she added, its ''meditative, allusive beauty retains a powerful ability to entrance,'' and this selection of his poems ''attests to both his maturation as a poet, and his ongoing interest in investigating the formal possibilities of his art.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Ashbery's THREE POEMS ($7.95), a trilogy of poems in prose - ''The New Spirit,'' ''The System'' and ''The Recital.'' ''The language is everywhere magnificent,'' our reviewer, Paul Zweig, said in 1972. ''One forgets to pursue one's hunger for logic amid the glories of pure language.''

Dr. Sakharov spoke in an interview. #14 Afghan exiles burned Soviet flags and an effigy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Pakistan in protests marking the seventh anniversary of the Soviet troop move into Afghanistan, witnesses and Afghan sources said. #3 An airline policy was blamed by a South Korean captain for deterring the crew of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 from turning back on its flight into Soviet airspace in 1983. The policy punished crew errors. #8 The new N.S.C. staff seeks advice from a group of former Iran experts in the Government to help produce a policy toward Iran that would avoid the mistakes of the arms-for-hostages operation run by the National Security staff. #6 A setback for South African forces occurred when a captured black nationalist guerrilla killed two white police officers and escaped, the police reported.",1986-12-28T05:00:00+0000

The play draws strength from the dual authorship - the young Chekhov's ebullience and incipient sensibility, combined with Mr. Frayn's knowledge of dramaturgy.

After all, a lot of big projects changed course this year, and for the better. Most notable, surely, is Television City, the mega-development Donald Trump wants to build on the 76-acre site of the old Pennsylvania Railroad yards on the Upper West Side. The design for Television City by Helmut Jahn that Mr. Trump unveiled with much hoopla last year, an outlandishly simplistic exercise in urban gigantism, has now passed to a well-deserved oblivion and been replaced with a vastly more sophisticated scheme by Alexander Cooper. Whereas the old design looked like a series of rocket ships lined up in bleak open space, the new one attempts to create boulevards, streets and parks that bear some resemblance to real urban places. It is still far, far too big - the overall plan calls for more than 17 million square feet of space - but at least it is a decent and intelligent framework, and if the long process of public review can bring about a reduction in the amount of building that will occur on the site we might actually see a viable project.",1986-12-28T05:00:00+0000

Twelve months later, Times Square is still unlikely to be confused with the Garden State, but does anyone doubt that the New York theater district is less a place than a state of mind, as hard to pin down as ''the oldest established permanent floating crap game'' of ''Guys and Dolls''? The most warming new American play of 1986, Tina Howe's ''Coastal Disturbances,'' is to be found in a living-room-sized auditorium two flights up from ''The Common Pursuit,'' 30-odd blocks north of Shubert Alley. The year's boldest musical theater experiment, Martha Clarke's ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' was born in the tiny St. Clement's, in the shadows of the Broadway periphery, before finding a berth at the Public downtown. The most original performer Broadway has seen in ages, Robert Lindsay of ''Me and My Girl,'' turned up innocently at the neighborhood's most widely despised venue - the antiseptic hotel auditorium that usurped three venerable playhouses - and, like it or not, legitimized the place as a theater. And who would have imagined that a 1971 Off Broadway hit by John Guare, ''The House of Blue Leaves,'' would reawaken both the Newhouse and Beaumont theaters at Lincoln Center before moving south for its belated midtown debut?",1986-12-28T05:00:00+0000

''Klein Kunst'' (''Small Art''), a full-evening work performed on Saturday at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater, seems at first to belong unequivocally to Ms. Lamhut's recent body of clearly expressionistic dance.
