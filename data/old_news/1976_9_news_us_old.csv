us,Film: A Peculiar 'Death',"""Death Play"" is a peculiar, lopsided movie that attempts to join two stories done in drastically different modes. Despite one impressive performance it does not succeed.The main story is a naturalistic account of a young actress who, rehearsing her first big role, becomes increasingly estranged from her lover. The lover, a self-pitying, frustrated writer, vents his resentment of the actress's success by conducting a surreptitious affair with his estranged wife.The second story, suggestive of the expressionist theme of the 1920's, concerns the insane doorkeeper at the theater where the actress is working. A former Shakespearean actor, he begins to see her as the wife who once betrayed him. At the movie's end, spouting Othello and Hamlet, he kills her.Although Michael Higgins does the best he can as the madman, the role simply does not work. The stagy devices that accompany himthe rattling, hissing sound effects, his visions of his wifeare ludicrous.As for the main story, the tensions between the producer, the director and the star hired as the main actor are written with some acuteness, and have moments of liveliness and interest. The lover, on the other hand, played by James Keach, is simply too petulant and unpleasant to arouse the slightest concern.The one brilliant thing in the moviepitiably wastedis a beautiful, high-strung performance by Karen Leslie as the young actress. In her first movie roleshe has been seen in various regional theatersMiss Leslie makes the role not only believable but endearing as well: a shifting prism of high spirits, grief, humor and irrepressible life. She is so good that without being able to believe the murder at the end, we are terribly sorry about it.The PG rating is based, apparently, on the murder and a sex scene between the lover and his estranged wife.

Joseph Bartley, chief of preventive medicine at Fort Dix, following routine, called to warn the county health officer that the presumed adenovirus outbreak might also spread to civilians. That officer, in turn, alerted state health officials, who immediately suspected an outbreak of influenza, a viruscaused infection of the respiratory tract that is also commonly called grippe or flu.

The most notorious of her many liaisons was with the Russian poet Sergei Esenin.

As for the agents themselves, the general manager usually kept a can of Flit on his desk for dealing with them. Aware of this sentiment when Earl Wilson asked him to represent him in salary talks with the Detroit Tigers, Woolf hid out in the pitcher's apartment. First the two of them reviewed Wilson's records for 1966, when he divided the summer between the Red Sox and Tigers 18 victories and 11 defeats, 136 for Detroit  and agreed on what he should get and how he should ask for it. Then Wilson went alone to talk with Jim Campbell, the general manager. Whenever a problem arose, he would excuse himself, go to an outside phone and get his lawyer's advice.

us,Screen: Monument From Japan,"MASAKI KOBAYASHI, the Japanese director, makes long, movies. ""The Human Condition,"" his adaptation of the six-volume antiwar novel by Jumpei Gomikawa, ran nine hours in three three-hour segments. It was not the sort of film that would have been easily enoured by the late Harry Cohn, the movie mogul, who, when asked how he could tell whether a movie was good or bad, said, though more bluntly, ""My backside tells me."" Mr. Kobayashi's best film, ""Harakiri,"" ran a mere two hours and 10 minutes. His new (1974) film, 'Kaseki"" (Fossil), now at the New Yorker, runs close to three hours and is mostly about a man who is dying of cancer.I say that quickly because, although I think ""Kaseki"" is a monumental film, not everyone wants to see a monument, and even those who do might want to prepare themselves for the experience. Mr. Kobayashi's method is conventional enough at first. He photographs everything more or less straight on. There are no ornamental dissolves, just plain, clean cuts from one scene to another, and such very conventional devices as shots of airplanes (Pan Am) taking off and landing to let us know that someone who planned a trip has actually made it.The method seems conventional, but it isn't at all. Mr. Kobayashi has made ""Kaseki"" the way a novelist writes. He supplies detail upon detail  sometimes visually, sometimes in dialogue, sometimes through the voice of an omniscient narrator  to such an extent that he finally pierces the surface of things that no ordinary, conventionally employed camera ever does. This takes time. To appreciate ""Kaseki"" you must be ready to pay attention to a director who doesn't bother to smile and say ""please."" There's no attempt to beguile.""Kaseki"" is the story of Itsuki (Shin Saburi), a self-assured, self-made construction-industry tycoon, a widower with two married daughters and self-interested enough to tell his pregnant daughter that she must have a boy. ""Your sister has a daughter so I would like to have a son."" Itsuki runs a benign autocracy.As postwar Japan has flourished, so has he until one afternoon, while on a business-pleasure trip in Paris, he feels the first pangs of trouble. When he learns the truth, that he has an inoperable cancer of the stomach, Itsuki locks himself in his hotel room. He considers suicide, but that's not his style. He drinks too much. He pats the place where the pain is as if to soothe the crab within, the cancer that is eating him aiive.""Kaseki"" is an almost clinical, hour-by-hour report by a man reassessing his life. On a trip through Burgundy with a young Japanese couple and a beautiful, thirtyish Japanese woman, the wife of a wealthy Frenchman and someone whom Itsuki has come to associate with death, the materialist begins to see a world quite different from any he's known before. He becomes aware of a sense of serenity while walking through an ancient cathedral that has provided continuity for generations.Back in Tokyo he goes about putting his business affairs in order, attempts to re-establish ties with his elderly, addled stepmother, whom he once hated, and has a reunion with an old Army comrade with whom he served in China. Itsuki, who has envied French resistance fighters for being able to die in a just cause, remembers his own service with bitterness. He agrees with the old comrade who say that ever since their war they both have lived on borrowed time.As played by Shin Saburi, Itsuki initially seems impassive, then a man of such immense, painful sensitivity that when fate changes course and provides a dnouement somewhat different from the one we've expected, what would be a happy ending in any other film isn't. Mr. Kobayashi isn't interested in such distinctions.Though ""Kaseki"" is almost totally humorless, it's not pompous. It is a thoughtful, contemplative film, composed of sometimes beautiful, sometimes banal, sometimes picture-postcard-pretty images that ultimately reveal the profound desolation of one rather ordinary fellow. Itsuki, I suspect, may also be Mr. Kobayashi's image of the Japan of Sony, Toyota, Asahi Pentaxes and those Japanese rice crackers now being exported to the cheese dips of the world.",1976-09-10T05:00:00+0000

Better Boy tomato is a hybrid variety and would not come true to seed, but Marglohe, one of the older openpollinated varieties probably would come true to seed as nonhybrid tomato varieties will naturally selfpollinate. Theodore Fastje, a Westchester County reader, saves his tomato seed by picking one fruit each variety, when fully ripe. He spreads the seeds, including a little pulp, on a paper towel to dry and labels each towel. The towels are stored in his dry cellar until spring when he peels off the seed and plants it. There is more to seed saving. To perpetuate the highest quality in the end product, buying fresh seed every year is recommended. Isolating varieties the home garden is difficult and open field pollination invites cross breeding with less desirable varieties. Also, so many advances have been made with hybrids, particularly with regard to disease resistance and vigor, they are worth the extra price. Only when vegetable varieties are of rare or odd interest or unobtainable is saving your own advised. Ed.",1976-09-12T05:00:00+0000

His material can be, and often is, brilliant, distilling the essence of a social group or cultural/ political movement. On the other hand, he is humanfrail, vulnerable and not beyond the entrapment of occasional misjudgments and mediocrity. I admire much of his work. I find some of it tedious, a few of his public posturings suspiciously tinged with opportunism. do not consider him a patron saint, but I also would not miss an opportunity to listen to him.",1976-09-13T05:00:00+0000

What Mr. Watkins has succeeded in doing is to suggest the multiplicity of psychological and social factors at work on the man, using a narrative form that is simultaneously journalistic and as freely associated as a dream.In the past, the director's fondness for a simulated cinma vrit style has resulted in ludicrous anachronismsfacetious television interviews with people on the point of being gunned to death, hand-held camera footage of situations unlikely to be recorded even by a secreted Kodak Brownie. The method got in front of the subject and then ridiculed it. Not so this time.The style is now muted. When members of Munch's family, his friends, associates, critics and contemporaries talk directly to the camera, it's the perfectly acceptable device of fiction that's been used by Bergman, Godard and others. You don't get the queasy ""You Are There"" feeling that you once got when Walter Cronkite interviewed Julius Caesar on his way to the Forum.""Edvard Munch"" is a long film just under three hours. It covers the painter's life from his child hood when, as he wrote, ""illness insanity and death were the black angels that kept watch over my cradle,"" until 1908 when, at the age of 45, he had completed his important ""Frieze of Life"" paintings and was slipping into nervous collapse.Art historians may object that this hardly gives a complete picture of the man who, though tormented, perhaps psychotic, continued to work fruitfully with increasing recognition for another 35 years, dying at 80, a substantial age for anyone but especially for someone so ravaged by the demons within.That may be so, but ""Edvard Munch,"" though it's based upon the life and celebrates the talent of a real artist, is fiction, as are all films except possibly newsreels. The form that Mr. Watkins has imposed on the material illuminates a major part of that life, the obsessions that drove Munch to his seminal attempts to express visually states of mind, including his own anxieties, his fears, his longings to reach to others through love that was was both spiritual and intensely sexual.The two major themes of the film are his death-haunted childhood in Oslo (then Cristiania), when his sister and his mother both died of tuberculosis, and a tumultuous love affair with a still-anonymous married woman identified only as Mrs. Heiberg.In the manner of an obsessed mind, the film keeps returning to images of his dying sister and to those of later humiliations at the hands of Mrs. Heiberg. At the same time, Mr. Watkins gives us what is virtually a documentary report on the conservative, middle-class, puritan society that shaped his life, a society where (in 1884) prostitution was legalized but there were no laws against child labor.The movie cuts almost manically back and forth among a half-dozen different periods of time like the thoughts of a man on a couchfrom the childhood of disease and death, to disastrous exhibitions in Norway and Germany, to the unhappy love affairs, to youthful discussions in Cristiania's little bohemia, to the later encounters with celebrate dcontemporaries, including Strindberg.We see the artist painting and a number of his canvases, woodcuts and lithographs, but the emphasis is on the man and his time, as the director seems to understand that he can't recreate the process by which these extraordinary works came into being.Geir Westby is fine as the artist whose vision we share in much of the beautiful color-camerawork by Odd Geir Saether. Gro Fraas, whose looks recall Liv Ullmann's, plays Mrs. Heiberg, seeming to be as arbitrary, untrustworthy and tender to us as to Munch. The film, shot in Norway by Mr. Watkins, has Norwegian, Swedish, French and German dialogue, translated by subtitles, as well as English narration based on Munch's own letters and journals.Admittedly the competition isn't great, but ""Edvard Munch"" must be one of the few films about a serious artist that can be taken seriously.",1976-09-13T05:00:00+0000

The heroine goes on to add, rather damply, ""A woman must live for love.""That's hardly the gospel according to Erica Jong, but those would have been revolutionary words in the late 16th century, which is the period of Miss Tanaka's stately melodrama about a well brought-up young woman, a convert to Christianity, which was then about to be suppressed in Japan, who chooses something other than dishonor when faced with the prospect of becoming the regent's newest concubine.""Love Under the Crucifix"" doesn't have very much to do with Christianity, though its heroine wears a cross and has taken a vow of chastity because the man she loves, who is Christian, is married. It has more to do with various Japanese interpretations of honor and sacrifice, this time seen largely from a woman's point of view.Of more interest than the film ifself, a sort of feudal soap-opera that was made in 1960, is Kinuyo Tanaka, who is apparently Japan's only woman director. Born in 1910, she was one of the country's leading film actresses during the 30's and 40's and turned to directing in the 50's. Students of Mizoguchi's films will remember her performances in ""Life of O-Haru"" and ""Sansho the Bailiff.""The film will be shown again today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 8 P.M.

To open its annual series of American experimental films, the Whitney Museum is showing a three-hour swatch of these notes, under the title ""Lost Lost Lost.""They are grainy and elliptical, these brief scenes, with Mr. Mekas's voice making a keening, accented commentary upon them. They begin with his first years, living with Lithuanian relatives and friends in Brooklyn; then making a break along with his brother Adolfas, moving to Manhattan and slowly and painfully becoming an experimental film maker and member of an avant-garde that included Allen Ginsberg, Frank O'Hara, Andy Warhol and others.As time passes, the straightforward awkwardness of Mr. Mekas's camera is replaced by a mannered awkwardness, the shots tumbling, blurring and distorting. It is a process the author uses quite deliberately to illustrate the process of pain he is trying to record.""Sing Ulysses, sing your travels,"" Mr. Mekas's voice begins, and he goes on to speak of ""a man who never wanted to leave his home . . . who was thrown into the world."" The movie, from start to finish, is about the damage done by exile; only in the first part it is shown directly, and thereafter, indirectly.It is the first part that has most of the power: it is an infinitely moving and perceptive record of the exile of a whole community. Mr. Mekas, at the time fully a part of this community, records the meals, the weddings, the Sunday outings. He records the pain of the refugee doctors, lawyers, poets, politicians who suddenly find themselves transplanted as truck drivers, messengers and factory hands.They meet, they form committees, they dress up for a picnic in the country at the end of which they sit, in rows of garden chairs, to hear a former Cabinet minister talk about the situation. They take all the steps, these educated and decent people, that they have taken all their lives; but suddenly, in the hard soil of a new country, they leave no footprints. The fact that Mr. Mekas used a silent camera strengthens the image of ghosts who gesture, pace, talk and make no sound.And then Jonas, and his brother Adolfas, seeing nothing ahead but a future of Lithuania Day dances, leave this futile reality, move to Manhattan and, as the author puts it, ""start from scratch.""Even a futile reality is not so easily replaced. They write, they take odd jobs, they work on film, they make friends in the avant-garde. But there is no center. Mr. Mekas follows and filmssometimes quite beautifullyall the vigils and peace marches of the late 1950's. (How peaceful the demonstrators look from this side of the late 60's; how gentle the police look.) He makes experimental films, makes filmed haikus in the snow.It is pretty, some of it, but dated and pretentious by now. With the novelty long past, the caperings of Mr. Mekas and his friends remind us of children who protest the lack of anything to do by posturing and grimacing. It is a frenetic hopefulness mustered against a real emptiness of exile, and the exile is not just for two Lithuanian brothers from Brooklyn but for their American contemporaries as well.We get the message, but it does not touch us as the message in the first part does. A dying reality is material for a splendid film; a living emptiness hardly ever is.",1976-09-15T05:00:00+0000

At the time the Philadelphia Phillies were 151/2 games ahead of the Pittsburgh Pirates, while the Cincinnati Reds, the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals were dominating their divisions. But then the Phillies and the Royals began to lose, and the Pirates and the Oakland A's began to win. And now September baseball exists. It's a new experience Kansas City, where September always was a month for football. But here September is the month where, in 1964, the Phillies blew the National League pennant by losing 10 of their last 12 games.

us,'Bugsy Malone' Puts youth in 20's Gang Movies,"""If it were raining brains,"" says the narrator at the start of ""Bugsy Malone,"" ""Roxy Robinson wouldn't even get wet."" We then see a close-up of the terrified face of Roxy Robinson as he's pursued down a dark Manhattan alley by the gunmen of a rival gang. Suddenly he's cornered. Roxy pleads for his life. ""Hey, fellas . . ."" But in vain. Right in front of our eyes Roxy Robinson is executed with gangland's newest secret weapon, the Splurge gun, a machine gun loaded with what looks like Reddi-Whip.That custard pies can maim and whipped cream should kill are only two of the ways in which some basic laws of the cinema are cheerfully junked in this wildly uneven but imaginative and stylish satire of 1920's gangster movies. The film, which opened yesterday at the Baronet, was written and directd by Alan Parker, an Englishman with a lot of improbable talent.I mean that only someone with an improbable talent and an emerging death wish would attempt to make such a film, which also includes a first-rate musical score and choreography, along with a cast of kids. They aren't ""Our Gang"" toddlers by any means, but young teen-agers, some of whom look pre-pubescent and others in their mid-20's, a discrepancy that haunts the film and makes for some uneasy moments.But discrepancy is virtually the method of the movie, which is at its best when the satire is played straight without cute mannerisms. When one isn't aware that most of the girls look years older than the boys, and when we don't see that the cars they are driving are propelled by pedals, ""Bugsy Malone"" has a good deal of the charm of the stage version of Sandy Wilson's ""The Boy Friend.""In addition to Mr. Parker's very funny screenplay and his apparent ability to tone down the natural stridency of his young actors, the film's chief assets are the 10 Paul Williams songs that are very much of this decade, but presented in orchestrations that wittily recall the sounds of the 1920's.They are lip-synched by the actors, but sung on the soundtrack with much verve by Mr. Williams and some other uncredited singers, including a young woman who does two Streisand-like numbers, ""I'm Feeling Fine"" and ""Ordinary Fool,"" as well as the now-comparable Barbra might do them.Gillian Gregory's choreography, with much emphasis on the Charleston, is the first real choreography we've had on the screen in a couple of years. It has a nice, old-fashioned (by movie standards) directness to it, especially in a song called ""Bad Guys,"" in which five fresh-faced hoodlums sing and dance the pleasures of being absolutely rotten (""We could have been anything we wanted to be. . . . But we're the very best at being bad"").Scott Baio, who looks young in a small, slight, sort of ageless way, plays the title role, that or a good-hearted fellow who joins a gang to get money to send his true love, named Blousey (Florrie Dugger), to fulfill her dreams in Hollywood. I have no idea how old Miss Dugger is, but by being pretty, fat-faced and very, very prissy she is marvelously funny as the ingnue. The star of the show, though, is Jodie Foster who, at 14 (14?), comes across as a combination of Jean Harlow, Twiggy and Glenda Farrell. She is tough, comic, and on her way to becoming one of the screen's great beauties.The boys in the cast, including Mr. Baio and John Cassissi, who plays Fat Sam, the speakeasy owner and failed ganglord, have a much tougher time because they always look to be in adult masquerade, even when you suspect that they might be older than they look and victims of arrested development. Their performances are good, but their appearances are disorienting, which is not true of the girls because, I suspect, we expect girls to be older for their ages than boys.""Bugsy Malone"" is a picture for Humbert Humbert to see again and again. It is also something of an achievement in the cinema of the G-rated bizarre.",1976-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Having just emerged from the working class, his mother and father guard their bourgeois status not tenaciously, but primly, as if it were their bookcase full of fragile, unspeakably awful knickknacks.""Riddance,"" which was shown yesterday at the Second International Festival of Women's Films at the Cinema Studio, will be repeated Monday at 6 P.M. and Tuesday at 8 P.M.The film is the second by Miss Meszaros, whose ""Adoption,"" was one of the better selections shown this spring at the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series.On the basis of these two films, Miss Meszaros is a director of real sensitivity with an affection for characters who pursue unpopular causes, including honesty, to lunatic lengths. Although the heroines in both films are women of fire backbone and wit, the movies themselves look deceptively austere. It's not that the director is without humor, but rather that she prefers to let it surface so perfectly surrounded by unhappy circumstances that it's easy to overlook. The humor has the effect of a joke remembered in tranquility. It's lonely.Thus, though ""Riddance"" is a serious film, it's likely to seem more solemn than it actually is. In addition, Miss Meszaros's characters don't share happy or funny moments with the audience. When they occur, it's as if they are simply meant to be a measure of the extent of some future loss. Miss Meszaros does not believe in leaving us laughing or crying, only, if possible, more thoughtful.Erzsebet Kutvolgyi, as the young woman, a sort of Hungarian Alice Adams whose family doesn't come up to the snobbish standards of her suitor's, is pretty and lithe and as close to being funny as anything in the film. Gabor Nagy is good as the young man whose bourgeois affection and respect for his bourgeois parents are stronger than his love for the girl.

Aloisethe protagonistmakes a remarkable series of paintings: bright-colored, Chagall-like figures with a rocketing sexuality and, invariably, closed eyes.""Aloise,"" which was shown yesterday in the Second International Festival of Women's Films at the Cinema Studio, is divided by its director, Liliane de Kermadec, into two very distinct sections. The first is an elliptical series of scenes, filmed with deliberate stillness and a white light, showing the protagonist as a young girl.She is the daughter of a Swiss railroad employee; she lives with him and her sister. Her mother is dead. ""My name,"" she says, ""has every vowel except 'u.' I wish I were called 'Lulu'."" She is sure she is a singer; she takes lessons, practices, glares at other less-determined singers at church. But her voice won't serve; it is tuneful, but hard and reedy.As played by Isabella Huppert, the adolescent Aloise is, in her unvarying gravity, a figure of some mystery. What is this frustrated effort, this self-delusion building toward?The scene shifts suddenly, and so does the actress. She arrives in Germany for her job as a governess; almost at once the role is taken over by another actress, Delphine Seyrig. She falls in love hysterically, is sent home, and breaks down.The mystery of the child is resolved: All those nuances were preparation for madness. But this is asserted, not demonstrated. There is no real link: First she was sad as Isabella Huppert, then she was mad as Delphine Seyrig.The bulk of the film, then, is Miss Seyrig in the asylum. We see the doctors talking, the other patients, Aloise serself. It is most painfully and well observed, and Miss Seyrig's performance is breathtaking. But for quite a while we are never really sure why we are seeing it.The ending puts things together to some extent. Aloise begins to paint on wrapping paper, the doctors encourage her, and her work is put on exhibition in a big-city gallery. There is one splendid scene: She inspects the display, this aged sparrow of a woman, still quite mad, hopping by those evidences of a life that lives only on the wall and that she only faintly recognizes. And making banal comments such as this one, in front of a picture of two lovers: ""This is a little vulgar; pretty, but not my cup of tea.""A startling image of disassociation, it almost makes up for the long, long passages that precede it.",1976-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Bleak Film Depicts Urban Woman,"Stockholm has rarely looked so bleak as it does in Stig Bjorkman's ""The White Wall,"" which was shown yesterday at the International Festival of Women's Films. Except for the protagonist, the streets are all but empty and the few people in sight pass like fish swimming 1,000 feet below the surface of a cold sea.This numbness, this uncommunicating despair is intended to be the message and consequence we draw from one day and night in the life of a lonely woman. Instead it is applied beforehand, as it were; it flows into the story rather than flowing from it.Monika, played by Harriet Andersson, is divorced and lives with her son. She is looking for a job and picks up men for company. When the film opens, she sits up in bed, climbs over the stranger sleeping beside her, totters into the next room, takes a pill, looks at a newspaper and sends her son off to school. She is wearing white, the bed coverlet is white, the walls are white; the whiteness is a symbol of isolation and sterility.The man, who has picked her up the night before at one of the dances she regularly goes to for that purpose, comes out to dress. He is perfectly nice, they are both civilized and wry, and they have nothing whatever to say to each other.She teeters through the dayjob-hunting unsuccessfully, buying a skirt, bickering over the telephone with her ex-husband, visiting a friend and going to another dance with her and picking up still one more stranger.Lank, dispirited, numb; she is, or is intended to be, the symbol of the modern urban woman as victim of an impersonal society and of men who are victims too. Men and women are rival gangs: The men gather in knots at the dance hall and plan their attack; the women sit in pairs and mock the attackers. The transactions take place, from sheer need; but they are hostile transactions.""White Wall,"" which will be repeated at the Cinema Studio Theater tonight and tomorrow night, has force but it lacks life. Monica's depression, her inability to give or receive anything, her selfishnessthees are meant to be wounds but in fact they are knives. Our sympathy is never aroused; and our sense of distance from her and the film may be a pity, but it is a fact.",1976-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Certainly Speedboat makes no concession to any cravingvulgar or sophisticatedfor an engrossing narrative. Furthermore, though concerned fleetingly with motivations, Speedboat avoids the sustained psychological rendering of character as rigorously as the novels of RobbeGrillet, but without attempting their quasimusical purity as linguistic constructs.

Pavese has been seen as a realist because his novels explore the irreparably rent social fabric of mid century Italian society from a clearsighted though impassioned socialist perspective. But the dynamic tension between the earthcentered peasant world of Pavese's native Piedmontese hills and the sophisticated, alienating city of Turin, where he worked as a translator, teacher and editor and where he took his own life in 1950 at the age of 42, assumes a role of mythic importance in his work, lending it a personal, poetic intensity that belies its objective surface.",1976-09-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The search for Carter,"Plains was different from what one expected. Maybe it was the name, but anticipation had been of a dry and dusty town with barren vistas, ramshackle warehouses and timeless, flybuzzing, sunbaked afternoons. Instead, Plains was green. As one approached, the fields were green and the trees were tall. The heat of southern Georgia was as hot in summertime as it promised to be, but there was shade under the elms, the pecan trees and the oaks, and if the streets were wide, the foliage was rich enough to come together overhead. A surprising number of houses were big and white and wooden and looked to be 50 years old or more. Some were a hundred years old. They had porches and trees in the front yard, and lawns ran a good distance from the front door to the sidewalk while the grass to the rear of the house meandered leisurely into the back yard of the house on the street behind. Some homes might be newly painted, and some were shabby, but the town was pleasant and spread out for a population of 683 inhabitants. By comparison with meaner looking places with a gas station, barbecue shack, general store, junkyard, empty lots and spilled gasoline, a redneck redolence of dried ketchup and hamburger napkins splayed around thinshanked, dusty trees, Plains felt peaceful and prosperous. it had the sweet deep green of an oldfashioned town that America has all but lost to the Interstates and the ranch houses, the mobile homes and the condominiums, the neon strips of hottedup truck stops and the static pall of shopping centers. Plains had an antique store on the main street that must have been a hundred feet deep, and it was owned by Alton Carter, Jimmy Carter's uncle; Plains had a railroad running througn the middle of the main street and a depot that was not more than twice as long as a tinker's wagon: Plains had an arcade one block long (the length of the main street) and all the stores were in the shade under the arcade, including a brand new restaurant called The Back Porch with white tin ceilings 15 feet high, fourblade propeller fan turning overhead and chickensalad sandwiches with a touch of pineapple and a touch of peppertasty. Plains was that part of America which hitherto had been separate from the media, the part that offered a fundamental clue to the nature of establishment itself, One could pass through a hundred small towns in a state, and 20 or 30 might be part of a taproot for the establishment of its capitol 20 draw upon. A place like Plains could be modest by the measure of its income and yet offer an unmistakable wellordered patina, a promise that the mysterious gentility of American life was present, that there were still people interested in running things without showing the traces, that the smalltown establishment remained a factor to be taken account of among all the other factors like exhaust roar and sewage slick and those plastic toylands stretching to the American horizon.",1976-09-26T05:00:00+0000

When you first learn that Bugsy Malone acted by kids, your stomach has every right to turn over. The heart can miss a beat. The mind bends under the awful weight of memories of radio's old Horn & Harden Children's Hour, when fouryearold tots with oddly formed vocal chords did imitations of Sophie Tucker, Harry Lauder, Helen Kane, Al Jolson and Lillian Roth. Perhaps, like me; you can also remember being forced to sit through some dreadful nonsense, made, I suppose, for children, in which chimpanzees wearing little suits and dresses and sunbonnets waddled through an entire feature film that was supposed to be a comic Western. My friends and I gave that one a groupcringe. I suppose some kids liked it but at the age of nine or ten, the members of my group thought It was overcooked rhubarb.

Va. This is the rolling river nostalgically recalled in the old folk song, and its bountiful farmland is celebrated in the paintings of Grandma Moses. One of the first to be taken by the beauty of the valley (and its economic promise) was George Washington who, as a young surveyor's apprentice in 1748, noted in his diary that the land is exceeding Rich and Fertile all ye way and produces abundance of Grain, Hemp, Tobacco, etc. German and Scotch. Irish settlers moved into the valley from Pennsylvania in the 18th century along the Great Wagon Road.

S. 11, it is lined with. markers commemorating its long history.

Many critics wbo regard Practical Criticism as a mechanical exercise are resorting to intellectual activities which are metaphysical rather than literary. Much of this work is best understood as proposing a secular version of metaphysics or a scheme of postChristian ethics. Leo Bersanfs new book is a case hi point it is literary in the sense that it is a commentary upon works of literature, mostly fiction and drama, but it is criticism only in a special sense. Professor Bersani is not interested in discriminating between works of literature good, bad, or indifferent. He is chiefly engaged in mounting an argument in favor of psychic mobility, a condition in which we release ourselves from the rigidity enforced by a psychology of the coherently structured and significantly expressive self. The works he chooses for discussion either support such a psychology or affront it; either way, they become texts for a commentary better understood as a rhetoric than a critique. Professor Bersani's art is offered as an interpretive fiction, a meditative structure provoked by works of literature but ready at any moment to act independently and to consult its own interests.",1976-09-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: The Rich, the Bored, 'The Sunday Woman'","A plot is the pretext for a good detective story, not its point. The characters and the setting are the point. The plot serves to display the characters in a conventional kind of motion, as a model's walk displays her clothes. It serves as a vehicle for making tours of the setting; the more rambling and full of holes it is, the better the view.The plot of the new Italian film, ""Sunday Woman,"" is as full of holes as a plateful of macaroni. It creaks and rambles but it takes us through a dry and lovely comedy of manners, with Marcello Mastroianni, Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Louis Trintignant all making the most of parts that allow them to show their gifts for stylishness and subtlety.It is set among the rich and boreda favorite predeliction of Italian filmsthis time, in Turin. It is a society of busy industrialists and wives who have plently of time and means for odd games and exotic relationships. For example, Ana Maria Dosio, wife of a rich businessman, spends a lot of time with Massimo Campi, the idle son of a rich family. The relationship is more or less platonicMassimo has a young man as a loverand is occupied mostly by a search for style. Massimo, for example, decides that it would be equally vulgar to own an expensive car and a cheap one, so he takes taxis. As the movie opens, the two of them are engaged in an interminably reasoned quarrel over whether pronouncing ""Boston"" with a Bostonian rather than an Italian intonation is the intelligent or the pretentious thing to do.Into this cobweb life two things erupt. Somebody smashes the head of Garrone, an unlikable crumb attached to Turin's upper crust. The weapon is one of the counterfeit ancient stone phalluses that he sells to foreigners. Quite a few members of Turinese high society, including Ana Maria and Massimo, had reason to dislike Garrone. So, with the greatest reluctance, the authorities put Inspector Santamaria on the case. Hiss assignment, in effect, is to solve the crime without catching anybody.Santamaria is the most winning and nuanced role that Mastrioanni has had for some time. He is a serious man of the middle class. He has aspirations to the good life, dresses in sport clothes that are a little too careful, and has an eye for women; but he is a moralist.He is sanely apprehensive about his mission. ""Dsio. Dsio. Campi. Campi,"" he mutters, the emphasis acknowledging the trouble he will have with his glittering list of suspects. But he pursues it with tenacity.The encounters of this nave, sensitive but purposeful man with the sophisticated and purposeless Beautiful People of Turin are the film's heart. There is a marvelous first encounter with Massimo, played by Trintignant. Santamaria offers American cigarettes; Massimo insists on cheap local ones. Santamaria quotes an appropriate Latin tag: Massimo says he doesn't know Latin. Santamaria is after the good things; Massimo, who has them all, rejects them as vulgar.The comedy turns serious when Santamaria discovers Massimo's young lover. The two poses crack  Santamaria is deadly serious about the crime; Massimo is deadly serious about his lover  and the two are suddenly shouting at each other. Trintignant makes his jaded sophisticate both funny and affecting, man teetering on the edge of a crackup.Santamaria's encounters with Ana Maria are even better. Again, seriousness  this time in the form of mutual attractionbreaks through the comical and mannered fencing. Jacqueline Bisset, a beautiful and most skilled actress who is usually starved on silly parts, is a battleground of real feeling and decadent detachment, a tempest in a crystal wine glass.There is a whole gallery of minor characters, some of them trite but most with at least a few moments of comic inspiration. Aldo Reggiani is particularly good as Massimo's young lover; a mixture of dopiness and moonstruck passion.The ending of ""The Sunday Woman,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a surprise, but it is a distant surprise and irrelevant. A mystery villain should be under our noses all the time. It is the final creak in the plot, but I was too pleased by the scenery to mind the destination.",1976-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Dutch 'Keetje Tippel':Sentiment Fairly Abounds at the 68th St. Playhouse,"""Keetje Tippel"" is doubtless one of the most gorgeous movies of the year, which is by no means to declare it one of the best. But giving this Dutch film its due is a little like making sport of ""Cinderella.""""Keetje Tippel,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, comes to us so coated with the sugar of its splendid costuming, its meticulously re-created late 19th-century Amsterdam atmosphere and the classicism of its improbable, happy ending that the temptation is not so much to advise prospective audiences to check their critical faculties at the door as to check their teeth for fresh cavities upon departing.There is little mitigation in the knowledge that the story told in ""Keetje Tippel"" is described as being based on factthe memoirs of a woman named Neel Doff. With her name changed in this film to Keetje (pronounced Kate-yuh), she is one of the children in an impoverished, oversized rural family that, like many others, migrated in 1881 to Amsterdam in search of food and work.A raw, coarse, nave and irrepressibly spirited girl, she fights against hazing by her fellow workers in a lethal wool factory, is subjected to rape at the hands of a milliner, submits to a doctor who names sex as his price for saving her from death from tuberculosis and becomes a whore under the chaperonage of her mother before her life takes a sudden turn for the better.The events of ""Ketje Tippel"" take place amid the terrible poverty of Keetje's family and others like it. One of her sisters is a prostitute. Her young brother takes money from a homosexual. People steal broad. Water floods their homes. Wooden shoes are used for firewood. Warmth and a little food represent dreams come true.Present in ""Keetje Tippel"" are the ingredients for powerful social commentary, but the collaboration of the director, Paul Verhoeven, and the cinematographer, Jan de Bont, has produced a movie that is romantic about adversity. From time to time, as though having pangs about the lavish patina they have imposed on such crushing poverty, the movie-makers inject a burst of revolutionary song, an artist who paints revolutionary pictures, though romantic ones; and a confrontation between workers and the police.As Keetje, Monique van de Ven has a field day, making the most of a role that enables her to undergo a transformation from hoyden to lady, playing by turns the coarse peasant, the innocent shop girl and the reluctant prostitute before blossoming into a radiant woman despite everybody and everything that might have destroyed her.By and large, her indestructible spirit is admirable.

(Italian title: ""Sesso Matto"") is to be on the point of death and to have every Italian comedy ever made pass in front of your eyes instead of your life. It's a disappointment not easily remedied.The film, which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East, stars Giancarlo Giannini and Laura Antonelli in eight sketches that parody Italian sexual manners in ways that run the gamut from harmless to painfully predictable to slightly nasty, as in the sketch in which he plays a young man hopelessly attracted to elderly women, the older and uglier the better.With the kind of witty material that Lina Wertmuller gives him, Mr. Giannini is an immensely gifted character actor. In this Risi film, we can see remnants of some of those other performances in the Groucho-like walk, the dainty pursuit of lust, the radar-like eyes that can detect and chart a fine bust at a distance of 50 feet.The material written by Mr. Risi and his partner, Ruggero Maccari, is so ex-hausted, though, that long before we get through a pointless sketch called ""Wild Gooseberries,"" spoken in imitation Swedish, we notice that the film has become a series of masquerades that allow Mr. Giannini to wear a lot of supposedly funny hair-pieces and glasses.Among the topics touched on but never successfully sent up are the impotence of a village Romeo, a premeditated murder effected by overindulgence in sex, and artificial insemination.Laura Antonelli, a stunning beauty and a talented comedienne, also wastes her talents, though the unadorned sight of her helps the time pass more quickly.",1976-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,'Burnt Offerings' Is an Outstanding Terror Movie,"Enter Ben and Marian with their 12-year-old boy, checking out the advertisement for a summer rental home. The isolated house is magnificent but decrepit Victoriana, not beyond the power to attractespecially Marian. And the price is right. Nine hundred dollars. Not a month. But for the whole season.Ben thinks there must be a catch, and what about the housework? ""The house takes care of itself,"" says the woman who, with her rather dotty brother, is offering it for rent. There is, of course, octogenarian mom at the top of the house. But she's no trouble. Just leave a tray outside her room at mealtimes. Marian agrees. She'll care for mom herself.And so begin the events of ""Burnt Offerings,"" which opened yesterday at a number of theaters, an excursion into eeriness led with admirable though not perfect assurance by the director, Dan Curtis.Here is the house as vampirealluring, renewing itself on injury, violence and death; capable of menance, vengeance, outrage and murder.To it, in all innocence, come such solid actors as Karen Black as Marian; Lee Montgomery as her son, David; Bette Davis as Ben's old Aunt Elizabeth, and Oliver Reed, as Ben, who is subject to nightmares about a childhood funeral, one of those old-fashioned glass-sided hearses and a chauffeur (Anthony James) whose face is going to haunt a lot of dreams for months to come.Director Curtis times his audience immersions into the ice bath of terror with such skill that moviegoers will scarcely have the leisure to ask why some of the renters aren't a bit more observant and curious about their dwelling.Only at the end does Mr. Curtis falter. Part of the climax is predictable; and, in another part, he relinquishes his deftness in favor of violence and gore on a scale that clashes with his earlier restraint.Nevertheless, such is his ability that, at the approach of the denouement during a preview of ""Burnt Offerings,"" members of the audience began murmuring and shouting nervous jokes in a vain effort to break the undeniable tension.Rental agents hereabouts should get down on their knees and give thanks that ""Burnt Offerings"" is opening now. It's the kind of movie that does for summer homes what ""Jaws"" did for a dip in the surf.The PG rating (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") seems attributable to one long shot of Marian diving nude into a swimming pool; to a couple of scenes indicating the state of Ben's and Marian's sex life, and, perhaps, to the climactic gore.",1976-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Is That You?"" on television some rainy afternoon, seen through the rising steam of a pile of ironing, and with the sound turned all the way down. Otherwiseunless customers sneak ironing-boards and tubs of wet-wash into the Criterion, Apollo and other theaters where it opened yesterday""Norman"" is very hard to imagine, let alone see.As a stage play, which ran 12 performances on Broadway, ""Norman"" was about the antics of one owner of a dry-cleaning shop who discovers simultaneously that his wife has run off with his partner and that his son is a homosexual. It was a comedy, not a tragedy except, perhaps, for those who bought tickets.The movie version, produced and directed by George Schlatter, substitutes a black family for a Jewish family. It helps matters not at all. It is a series of bad jokes about homosexuality, strung upon trite situation comedy and collapsing into what is meant to be an uplifting message about people being allowed to do their own thing.Well, Redd Foxxhe plays the dry-cleaneris a capable performer and he isn't doing his own thing. Pearl Baileythe wifeis a splendid performer and she isn't doing her own thing. They are both doing Mr. Schlatter's thing, and a poor, small thing it is.""Norman is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It is all talk and no action, but the film's message is that if your children grow up to be homosexuals, don't worry; and presumably this is what the guidance is suggested for.",1976-09-30T05:00:00+0000

In Wisconsin Death Trip, Mr. Lesy created a montage out of photographs and news items in order to show us what life was actually like in Black River Falls, Wis. in the 1890s. And while it is not certain that he proved his thesis that a large portion of the citizens of Black River Falls had obsessivecompulsive personalities ideally suited to the life of striving demanded by the American Dream (which is why they came undonewent crazy, murdered their children, committed suicide when the dream turned sour), there is no doubt that he showed us a sinister underside of the socalled Gay Nineties.",1976-09-30T05:00:00+0000
