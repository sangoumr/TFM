To direct the plants' energy into developing the immature fruit, cut off the stem growing tips and the new flower buds. Full-sized green tomatoes can also be hurried into ripening indoors by sealing them in a paper bag with an apple for several days. Keeping them together at room temperature will cause the apple to give off ethylene gas and turn green tomatoes red.",1981-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,A VERY SPECIAL GUITARIST,"James Blood Ulmer plays the electric guitar. So do countless professional, semiprofessional and amateur musicians the world over, but none of them sounds like Mr. Ulmer. He has shared concert stages with Ornette Coleman and other jazz artists and with forward-looking rock performers like Public Image Ltd. and Captain Beefheart, and he has been enthusiastically reviewed by jazz and rock critics. But his few recordings have been for independent labels, and he has been little heard outside New York City, where he lives, and a few European cities. That situation will change later this month when Columbia Records releases Mr. Ulmer's new album ''Free Lancing.'' Although it is actually his fourth LP, it will probably be the first of his recordings to penetrate beyond the small circle of new-music devotees that has been aware of his work all along. And it confirms what these devotees have been saying for several years now - that Mr. Ulmer is the most original electric guitarist to emerge since the late Jimi Hendrix, who made his most influential recordings between 1967 and 1970.",1981-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'UP TO THE MINUTE'--TOO SLICK,"Television's ''reality boom'' is usually defined in terms of entertainment programs such as ''Real People'' or ''That's Incredible!'' But the medium's true reality roots can be found in the presumably more lofty area of news, and it's here where the boom is expanding into a phenomenon with far-reaching reverberations. Local stations have discovered that news sells and that their newscasts can be quite profitable. On a network level, the CBS News presentation of ''60 Minutes'' has won a top-10 ratings prominence that is the envy of every entertainment studio in Los Angeles. ABC News is usually not too far behind with ''20/20.'' Then, floating somewhere between news and entertainment are a wide assortment of magazine shows with varying degrees of local coverage. Westinghouse's Group W was a pioneer on this level with its ''PM'' series, now in syndication.

As it happens, Norma's first words were apt enough: ''Sediziose voci!'' (''Traitorous voices!''). But they did not put down the jeering, which went on intermittently in one form or another all evening. The final curtain apparently developed into a noisy competition between those who had come prepared to boo and less contentious first-nighters who either liked what they had heard from the Italian soprano and the conductor, James Levine, or simply felt that famous artists should not have to hear unpleasant sounds on such an occasion. In fact, Miss Scotto did not measure up in any way to this most dem anding of bel canto roles, but that is not the point here.

In a nearly unanimous move, Parliament named Vice President Hosni Mubarak to succeed the assassinated president. For the past six years Mr. Mubarak had been a close associate of Mr. Sadat. The nomination is subject to a popular vote in an election in which Mr. Mubarak will be the only candidate. No official announcement was made but sources said the leader of the assassins was an army officer with ties to a fundalmentalist Moslem group involved in terroirism in the past. Meanwhile, Mr. Sadat's funeral was set for Saturday. (Page A1, Column 6.) The United States assured Egypt of continued strong support and promised to play an active role in the Egyptian-Israel negotiations for Palestinian autonomy. In the Reagan Administration's first policy statement since the assassinsation of President Sadat, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig also warned other countries against trying ''to manipulate the tragic events of the last 24 hours.'' At the same time the White House announced that Mr. Haig would head the delegation to Mr. Sadat's funeral. Neither the President nor Vice President Bush would will attend for security reasons.

us,Upshaw Steps Aside,"The Oakland Raiders, defending Super Bowl champions, have lost three of their first five games this season and have been shut out their last two games. Part of the problem has been the offensive line, which has allowed 19 quarterback sacks. So Gene Upshaw, the seven-time all-pro left guard, who has started all 207 Raider games since he joined the team in 1967, will be replaced in the starting lineup for Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs by Curt Marsh, Oakland's first-round draft choice, who had been on the injured-reserve list. Upshaw, who is 36 years old, admitted to Coach Tom Flores on Monday that he felt the pressure of the belief in some quarters that he should be benched, and that he didn't know how much longer he could handle it. ''Mentally is where I've been having my problems,'' Upshaw said yesterday. ''That's where it's gotten to me. My mind hasn't always been in the game,'' Upshaw, the captain and the oldest player on the team, said he would try to get his job back. ... Fred Dean, the all-pro defensive end who walked out on the San Diego Chargers in a demand for contract renegotiation and then was traded a week ago to San Francisco, has signed a series of four one-year contracts with the 49ers. ... Walter Payton, who has been taking his lumps this season with the Chicago Bears and has been unable to gain 100 yards in a game so far, can't blame his offensive line for this one: He suffered a slight thigh bruise when, believing that his 10-month-old son, Jarrett, was about to fall, he slipped grabbing the infant.",1981-10-09T05:00:00+0000

By Ted Barry ''There's a fever; there's an oil fever like there was a gold fever and a uranium fever.'' Dale E. Zimmerman, the top career Interior Department official in charge of onshore minerals, was talking about the ambitious plans of Secretary of the Interior James Watt plans to accelerate the leasing of oil-and-gas rights on Federal lands. What Zimmerman, whose title is Assistant to the Deputy Director for Energy and Mineral Resources, did not say, but what has been implicit in everything that he and Secretary Watt have been advocating for months, is that this fever should be exploited to spur domestic oil-and-gas production by opening up an additional 100,000,000 acres of Federal lands, mostly in Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states, for leasing. Their insistence on retaining the present methods of allocating onshore leases - a lottery for previously leased lands and a first-come, first-served (called, ''over-the-counter'') system for lands never before leased - has escalated an already heated controversy. The lottery system, which many critics both in and out of Government, contend is highly susceptible to manipulation and may, in fact, be illegal, has come under particular attack.",1981-10-11T05:00:00+0000

This occurred twice in recent auctions in New York, sales that attracted two quite different types of collectors. In one case a 1920's tea gown by Mariano Fortuny, the Venetian artist-designer, sold for $7,000, a record for the designer and the highest price ever paid at public sale for a period gown. In the other auction, a pair of ruby red silk slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in ''The Wiza rd of Oz'' sold for $12,000.Both prices are astounding considerin g the fact that the market for vintage clothing and other collect ibles is, according to many observors, now undergoing a mild recessi on.",1981-10-11T05:00:00+0000

This summer, while waiting for the eggs to divide, my attention was repaid by another lesson. I turned to Science magazine, to discover that a Senate committee was engaged in defining the beginning of human life: the junction of sperm with egg. What coincidence! On my left, urchin life was stirring in the dish; on my right, Science informed me that the Government was legislating biology, with the stated intent of supporting the ''Right to Life'' movement.

The two most notorious films at this year's festival have unquestionably been ''Lightning Over Water,'' an almost unbearably painful recording of the last, agonizing months in the life of Nicholas Ray (''They Live by Night,'' ''Rebel without a Cause,'' etc.), co-directed by Mr. Ray and Wim Wenders, and ''Taxi zum Klo'' (''Taxi to the John''), a breezy, frequently funny, aggressively candid ''reconstructed'' autobiography.",1981-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Kennedy came forward for a scene of podium harmony with Mr. Carter, but then drew back. Reagan aides insist that each tableau of the regrouping of the Pr esidents had been planned to the inch, and they refuse to believe Mr . Carter's moving slightly apart was anything but deliberate. Th eir rage was compounded at the close of the ceremony when Mr. Ca rter cut across the foreground - in Mr. Reagan's old profession, th at's stealing the spotlight - and went over to the press corps andbe gan shaking hands and saying ''Hi.''

As one stands looking east and west, at the two Berlins, the bland brutality of the division is as disturbing as the actual concrete barricade with its sinister baggage of alarms, mines and guards.

The best use for attics, they may be excused for contending, is to provide a refuge for old clothes and bats. They can bring history to bear to refute the Romantic thesis that great art is only produced under the stress of bohemian poverty, mental anguish or political persecution. For every tubercular Chopin coughing his life away over a nocturne, there has been a Strauss or an Elgar, comfortably situated and idolized by his countrymen.

us,New Jersey Journal,"Each year, the state's Division of Taxation issues an inch-thick report that is a gold mine for statisticians interested in the distribution of wealth. The report, a compilation of data from the state income tax and the homestead rebate program, is entitled ''Owner Occupied Housing Statistics from Homestead Rebate and Income Tax Data Match.'' Among other things, it lists the average gross incomes for every community in the state and a breakdown, for each community, of the number of households in various income brackets (i.e., under $5,000, between $5,000 and $10,000, and so on). The latest report, published last summer, is for 1979. It lists four communities with average gross income in six figures: Far Hills (Somerset County), $127,880; Alpine (Bergen), $119,564; Essex Fells (Essex), $101,616, and Harding Township (Morris), $100,311. Also included is 1979's average gross income and average property tax by county. NEIGHBORLY good feelings on Ocean Drive West in Brigantine have been frayed by Dr. Joseph Chaikin's new windmill. It's not a rustic, wooden bit of rural Americana that the doctor has put up amid a cluster of affluent homes, but a 60-foot-high, $16,000 model that churns out about 40 percent of his home's electricity when the winds off the Atlantic hit 25 miles a hour. For his trouble in trying to conserve energy, Dr. Chaikin has been hauled into State Superior Court in Atlantic City. The windmill, his neighbors argue, is too noisy and disturbs their sleep, televisionwatching and privacy. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 5 and a trial could follow. Until then, Judge L. Anthony Gibson has ordered, the windmill can be operated only two hours a day. Because of the pending court action, neither Dr. Chaikin nor his lawyer, Marvin Wallen, will comment. But the company that built the windmill - Enertech of Norwich, Vt. - is trying to sooth things. Edmund Coffin, Enertech's board chairman, says the problem is with the windmill's gear box. It is, Mr. Coffin notes, an early prototype with a noise level ''about 15 or 20 percent'' higher than the 50-decibel limit set by Brigantine's local windmill law. Meantime, a refined gear box is in production and will be installed. Kenneth Keslink, the salesman in the case, thinks both the 50-decibel level and the doctor's neighbors are unfair. ''They're all for energy conservation, but not in their neighborhood,'' Mr. Keslink said. ''The ocean, just about off their doorstep, makes more noise than this windmill is allowed to. The ocean is 50.7 decibels, and I tell them to turn it off.'' The mysteries of the sea never cease. One enigma is what caused at least 18 turtles to wash up dead last summer along a 40-mile stretch between Long Branch and Surf City on Long Beach Island. Perhaps 15 to 20 dead turtles wash ashore each summer, according to Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, a nonprofit agency in Atlantic City that monitors cases of dead or beached whales, porpoises and turtles. In summers past, most were easily explicable, he said: Some died natural deaths, some were shot or harpooned, some struck by boat propellers, some drowned in fishermen's nets. ''A lot of this summer's deaths are an unknown -no apparent cause,'' he asserted. . The carcasses ranged from 20-pound loggerheads to 1,000-pound leatherbacks. Mr. Schoelkopf's staff did autopsies on 13 turtles; the five others, too decomposed, were buried. No causes of death was discernible in eight of the 13, he said. Of the five others, three died of propeller cuts, one of a digestive-tract blockage and two others -both big leatherbacks - because they had swallowed plastic bags. ''Leatherbacks' natural food source is jellyfish, and maybe they mistook the plastic bags for jellyfish,'' Mr. Schoelkopf said. The bags blocked their intestines. When the National Park Service announced in the spring of 1980 that it planned to shoot more than 500 wild burros in the Grand Canyon, Cleveland Amory, president of the New York-based Animal Protection Group, decided to do something about it. The Park Service said that the burros - descendants of those abandoned by prospectors 100 years ago - were damaging the vegetation and competing with native animals for food. Mr. Amory persuaded the service to give him a chance to save the burros. He hired a group of cowboys who, by last summer, managed to round up more than 500 of the animals. The burros were taken to the fund's Black Beauty Ranch in Texas, and 40 of them eventually were shipped to the R-D-R Farm in Kingwood Township, Hunterdon County. The farm is owned by Rolf and Dale Bauersachs. Now the burros are up for adoption. This requires $200 and strict adherence to the fund's adoption contract. Among its provisions are that the burros must never be used as beasts of burden and that a written health report be sent to the fund every six months. Why would anyone want a burro? Mr. Amory smiles and responds: ''Just for kicks.'' In Colonial days, the Saddle River Valley in northwestern Bergen County was home to the Minsi branch of the Lenni Lenape Indians. Perhaps the best depository of their lore and artifacts belongs to the Upper Saddle River Historical Society. It has about 500 pieces, primarily arrowheads, stone tools, ceremonial pendants and beads and shards of clay pottery. The collection was donated to the society in 1976 by Cornelius Berdan, a lifelong farmer in Upper Saddle River who died in 1979 at age 86. ''He collected the pieces over a lifetime, starting when he was about 10 years old,'' said Kay Yeomans, president of the society. Much of Mr. Berdan's Indian relics were stored in boxes until two Upper Saddle River Boy Scouts, Ted Hampton and Mike Passero, sorted and classified them, built wooden handles and shafts for the various arrowheads and stone tools and assembled exhibits. Both became Eagle Scouts as a result of their work. Portions of the exhibits are on permanent display in the town library and at Cavallini and Reynolds Schools in Upper Saddle River. From time to time, elements are assembled into a ''traveling exhibit.'' Until Nov. 10, such an exhibit will be on display at the Bergen County Wildlife Center in Wyckoff, together with a much larger exhibit on Indian life that belongs to the State Museum in Trenton.",1981-10-18T05:00:00+0000

General Jaruzelski is said to share Mr. Kania's moderate approach, so no abrupt attempt to reverse recent liberalizing changes in the country's political life was expected, but the leadership change came as Central Committee called for a tougher line against ''antisocialists.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) Greece's standing government fell as the opposition Panhellenic Socialists won a major victory in parliamentary elections. The victory of the Socialists, led by Andreas Papandreou, over the Government headed by Prime Minister George Rallis, brought to an end 35 years of pro-Western, conservative rule in Greece. The Socialist's success could mean radical changes in Greece's foreign policy since the party has opposed the country's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Common Market as well as the presence of American bases in Greece.

The task force staff says the job will necessarily consume years, but for a quick measure of progress, citizens should consult the Federal Register, the Government's publication detailing regulations and changes. In January the Register had 10,134 pages, but by August it had been more than halved to 4,392 pages, dropping, Mr. Bush's office happily contends, like a fever chart.",1981-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Barney's has come up with an idea that's both fashionable and practical - leather spats that button over any lowheeled shoes, with a strap to anchor them under the instep. They come in burgundy, luggage tan, gold and bronze and could also be worn to update a pair of last year's short boots. You'll find them in the Women's Duplex on Barney's seventh floor for $55. 2. Gold for Change The fad for metallic leathers goes on and on. Anyone who doesn't already have a gold bag might check out an amusing one stocked by Macy's. It looks like an oversize change purse with a snap closing and has a long, shoulder-strap handle. It's $27 in the Metal Deposits section of the main floor arcade, which also carries gold or silver leather bangles for $8 each. 3. Apples of Her Eye When Bonnie Sewell, a California artist, spent a year in Texas she discovered the local craft of apple-head dolls and decided to try her hand at them. They looked fine, but the apples got wormy. Undaunted, Mrs. Sewell began making the puckered faces from cloth instead of fruit. Her creations include a peddler woman holding a tray of her wares: tiny pots and pans, baskets and brooms and a string of dried, real peppers. There is also a gardener with her flowers and tools, and a baker with a tray full of pastries, rolling pins and other utensils.",1981-10-21T05:00:00+0000

The sources said that the recruits, along with pilots from Britain and Canada, were hired and paid by companies controlled by Mr. Wilson and have been flying and maintaining, at least since last year, a Libyan fleet of American-made cargo craft and helicopters.

The judge, Thomas C. Platt of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said in July that the asserted misconduct was one of the reasons he was dismissing a jury verdict that found the defendants guilty of knowingly dealing in counterfeit popular-music tapes. The misconduct, the judge said, involved the prosecutor's ""attempted cover-up"" of ""false statements"" given by a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent on the witness stand. The judge ordered a retrial for the Goody company - one of the oldest and largest chains of recorded-music stores in the country - and the Goody official, Samuel Stolon, a vice president. In a brief filed last week, two Justice Department officials used unusually harsh language as they pressed the Government's attempt to reverse Judge Platt and have the convictions reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan. A review of the five-week trial last spring, the officials contended, ""reveals how utterly absurd is the District Court's ruling on this issue, and how outrageous its epithets directed against a career Government prosecutor were."" The officials attacking the Platt ruling were Edward R. Korman, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Thomas P. Puccio, head of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in the district, and Lawrence H. Sharf, their special counsel. The Goody trial prosecutor, John H. Jacobs, is a member of Mr. Puccio's unit. In earlier court papers, Mr. Korman charged that the judge's decision setting aside the convictions reflected ""an inexplicable animus toward the prosecution,"" while Mr. Puccio spoke of the judge's ""apparent hostility toward the prosecutor."" An aide to Judge Platt said the judge did not want to comment on these contentions because doing so ""would be improper."" Dismissal of Charges Sought But Martin R. Gold, a defense attorney in the case, said that ""the charge of judicial bias in favor of the defendants is totally unsubstantiated by the record."" Mr. Gold added: ""During the course of the proceedings in this case, the defense made at least six separate major motions to dismiss the charges against the defendants. Each of these motions had a substantial basis and could well have been granted, though each was denied."" Mr. Gold expressed these views recently in an affidavit he filed with Judge Platt asking again that the judge dismiss the charges altogether. As grounds this time, Mr. Gold cited ""improper, misleading and prejudicial publicity about the case, which was, by all appearances, generated by the prosecution."" In an affidavit of his own, Mr. Puccio denied the publicity-generating Charge and asked that Judge Platt remove himself from the case should there be a retrial. In accusing Mr. Jacobs of misconduct in prosecuting the original trial, Judge Platt referred to two appearances before the jury by the F.B.I. agent, Richard Ferri. In the first, Mr. Ferri testified that certain notes he had taken at meetings with Government informants had been destroyed. In his second appearance - which Judge Platt said he had, in effect, directed Mr. Ferri said that the relevant notes had not, in fact, been destroyed and that his original testimony had resulted from faulty recollection. Judge Platt described these events as Mr. Jacob's ""attempted cover-up of the false statements"" and called Mr. Ferri's testimony ""unquestionably relevant and material."" The brief by the Justice Department disputes that the Ferri testimony was false ""or that it was material to any issue the jury was required to resolve.""",1981-10-25T05:00:00+0000

True, when New York designers start to show their spring 1982 collections tomorrow, they will be bringing up the rear, the big guns of Milan, Paris and London having already shown theirs and been accorded the usual worldwide ballyhoo and publicity. And, sure as shooting, should any top American designer show any idea similar to one already spotted in another fashion capital, he or she stands to be labeled a silhouette snatcher. No one, it seems, considers that good designers are mysteriously and invariably on the same wavelength. Or that the best designers everywhere get the bulk of their fabrics from Italy's fabled factories and that these fabrics suggest, sometimes even dictate, the shape of the clothes. So it is the special talent of each designer that gives a finished piece of clothing its special twist, its personal stamp. And there are so many good design talents in New York, with points of view that range from blue-sky fantasy to good old down-to-earth, wearable practicality. So never mind that New York is the last one in the fashion-show parade. It is the marketplace offering the most to the largest number of vastly varied customers.",1981-10-25T05:00:00+0000
