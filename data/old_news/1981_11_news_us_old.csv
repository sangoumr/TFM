For several years, Mexico City's ''Green Angels'' have patroled the highways in green trucks looking for motorists who need help changing a tire or replacing a broken fan belt. The two patrols' functions are complementary, according to an official of the Mexican National Tourist Council. The Green Angels are equipped to perform minor auto repairs and are trained to provide first-aid if required. The Silver Angels,''who provide protection and assistance,'' the tourist council said, deal with more serious problems like accidents, illness and lost property. He also conceded that the new squad might serve as a deterrent to thieves preying on tourists. A visitor who needs help from either of the patrols should telephone 588-51-00.

He then rushed into camera range some 15 or 20 extras in whose existence no one was interested and scattered them about between the two characters and the camera lens (us), urging them to whoop and holler to their hearts' content. He then filled whatever was left of the visible area with smoke. I am exaggerating, but not much.",1981-11-01T05:00:00+0000

It is not an exhibition of much interest, frankly, to anyone on the lookout for a vivid or transcendent esthetic experience. The art in it - 100 examples of 19th-century American painting, drawing and sculpture from the collection of Jo Ann and Julian Ganz Jr. - is mostly pretty dull.

The postwar French political leaders - of the early Fifth as well as of the Fourth Republic - had, on the whole, come out of the Resistance; they had no reason to encourage explorations of the darker side of French wartime attitudes and policies. French archives were closed to scholars. It was only after 1970 that Marcel Ophuls's searing movie ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' began to challenge heroic myths and prudent silence. Nevertheless, when Robert Paxton's ''Vichy France'' appeared in a French translation in 1973, his stark and devastating description of Vichy collaborationism (which he based on German and American archives) was rather badly received in France, where many critics accused this scrupulous and thoughtful young historian either of misinterpreting the Vichy leaders' motives or of lacking compassion.",1981-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,REAGAN'S STAKE IN NEW JERSEY'S ELECTION,"Maurice Carroll is a reporter on the metropolitan desk of The New York Times. By Maurice Carroll o state in the union serves as the butt of so many jokes as New Jersey. Humorists from Mark Twain to Woody Allen have found that the mere mention of any town - from Hackensack to Ho-Ho-Kus - is good for a laugh. Now, however, New Jersey is enjoying a moment of national attention for a more dignifed reason: Next week's New Jersey election for Governor will serve as the first opportunity to test the popularity of the Republican Administration in Washington and, more specifically, the public's attitude toward Reaganomics. And while there is little to suggest that most New Jerseyans view their election in this light, a number of influential personalities clearly do. ''The whole country is watching,'' said President Reagan, who was in New Jersey campaigning for the Republican ticket. ''New Jersey is being offered a clear-cut choice between those who think Government spending and taxes are the solution to our problems and those ... who understand that Government spending and overtaxation are the problem.'' And Vice President George Bush, on another campaign stop in the state, agreed that a Republican victory would be ''a national symbol.''",1981-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,THE SCOREBOARD ON HEISMAN WINNERS,"Until the 1970's, winning the Heisman Trophy was far from a guarantee of future success. The first winner (in 1935), Jay Berwanger, a halfback from the University of Chicago, never even played professional football and other winners such as Gary Beban of U.C.L.A., John Huarte of Notre Dame and Steve Spurrier of Florida, quarterbacks who played in the mid-1960's, failed to gain winning reputations in the National Football League. The situation is very different now. The last five trophy winners, all running backs, are starters in the N.F.L., and four of the five are among the leading rushers in the league. Jim Plunkett culminated a decade in the National Football League when he led the Oakland Raiders to the Super Bowl title earlier this year. After winning the Heisman Trophy while at Stanford University, the quarterback was drafted by the Boston Patriots, who later changed their name to New England. In his first seven seasons as a pro, only one of his teams had a winning record. After leading the University of Alabama, Pat Sullivan, a quarterback, became the lowest choice of Heisman Trophy winners in the N.F.L. draft (late in the second round) since the Cowboys made Roger Staubach (the 1963 winner) a 10th-round pick in 1963. Sullivan was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons and was with the team from 1972 through 1975 as a backup quarterback. After winning the trophy as an all-purpose back for the University of Nebraska, Johnny Rodgers bypassed the offers of the N.F.L. San Diego Chargers and reportedly became the highest paid player in the Canadian Football League.",1981-11-01T05:00:00+0000

And the previous tenant had fought the idiosyncratic nature of the rooms by filling in the niches and obliterating the charming quirks that are typical of apartments in this venerable, late-19thcentury building.

The notorious rumbling of inferior turntables, which sounds somewhat like a soft growl from a large dog, makes an unwelcome accompaniment to any music. Even in its subtlest forms, rumble strips the dramatic hush from wispy pianissimi and coarsens the texture of diaphanous orchestrations.

The Ambassador officially protested to the United States over its recent statements portaying the Saudi plan as containing some positive approaches toward a Middle East peace settlement. The Israeli spokesman said that Mr. Evron told the Secretary of State that any show of American backing for the Saudi plan would be seen as a weakening of American backing for the Camp David accords, which Saudi Arabia rejected.

Strange, again, that such a composer should have arisen in and come to stand for Germany, which had established itself as the guardian of the idea of music as a branch of abstract thought. Bach's fugues (not the cantatas or the passions, of course) epitomize this concept of musical purity. Then Beethoven came along to strain that mold, and Wagner shattered it.

The opera is based on the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi during his years in South Africa (1893-1914), when the father of Indian independence first used the tactics of nonviolent civil disobedience to fight racial discrimination. The libretto, by Constance De Jong, is in Sanskrit, and the entire performance takes place behind a scrim. The music, with full orchestra, is described as softer and more lyrical than most of the other works of the avant-garde composer. Christopher Keene will conduct the Brooklyn Philharmonia, and Douglas Perry will sing the role of Gandhi. The staging is by Hans Nieuwenhuis. Tickets are $10 to $20 (benefit tickets for Monday night, at $100 each, which includes a party, are also available). Reservations only through Chargit: 944-9300.

Reagan Administration officials said that the European Economic Community had planned to issue a statement this week opening the way for the four countries to take part in the peacekeeping force. But the statement, which outlined their desires for a broader peace settlement that would take into consideration the rights of the Palestinians, was regarded as so offensive to Israel that the United States persuaded the Europeans not to issue it and to review their position. (Page 1, Column 1.) Britain's leaders are more worried about United States nuclear policy since the confusing and contradictory statements this week by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. Senior American officials in London said many British political leaders, including members of the Prime Minister's Cabinet, had been disturbed by the new controversy caused by Mr. Haig's statement that one NATO contingency plan for an attack on Europe by conventional Soviet forces included the possible detonation of a nuclear weapon as a warning. Mr. Weinberger said Thursday that there was no such plan. (1:2.)",1981-11-07T05:00:00+0000

In that year, I've had the opportunity to do a number of things that nationally elected leaders too rarely have the chance to do: to engage in extended discussions with people who are not regular visitors to the White House, to read extensively, to explore long-term issues without the pressures of day-to-day crisis management. This year has meant more to me than simply moving from the West Wing of the White House to a law office on Washington's M Street and new teaching positions in my state of Minnesota. It's meant a chance to refresh myself spiritually and restock the shelves intellectually. And I'm eagerly taking advantage of this opportunity.",1981-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Standing trial on charges of overprescribing addictive drugs for Mr. Presley and 10 other patients, Dr. Nichopoulos was acquitted, largely because the defense was able to establish that there is no universally accepted treatment for prescription drug addicts.

Cranberries, juniper berries and chestnuts go wonderfully, as does that sublime fall luxury that comes in fresh from Italy - white truffles. Roast pheasant can be served with vegetables such as brussel sprouts, celeriac, braised celery or roast potatoes flavored with rosemary.",1981-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Illustrated. 748 pp. New York: Atheneum. $30.THE playwright Clifford Odets was born in Philadelphia in 1906 and reborn, as someone scribbled on a wall, in 1932. He had lived through the 20's - that ''high plateau of permanent prosperity'' - but the young Odets was no part of that happy high decade. He felt he belonged to nothing, to nobody; he had succeeded at nothing, completed nothing. Without enthusiasm he tried suicide. He was a very obscure actor in summer stock, and on the larger stage of the world wholly invisible. ''To be sure,'' Margaret Brenman-Gibson, a psychoanalyst and his perfect biographer, writes, ''there was some substance in ... his secret writing, but it would take the cataclysm of the Great Depression, with its vast wake of stranded people, to provide his spiritual salvation. He could become a voice for a disinherited generation only when it appeared. His own conflicts could become creative when history opened the door.''",1981-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,WRITING THE GOOD LIFE,"BIOGRAPHERS are on a better-than-first-name basis with their subjects. They tolerate their idiosyncrasies, admire their style, second-guess their reactions, indulge their faults. If this resembles a great and good friendship evolved over a long term, it should; for writing a carefully researched biography routinely takes up a large portion of an author's life. The ties binding biographer and subject have been likened to a near-parasitic affair, in which the biographer is nurtured through the life of his subject; but ''symbiotic'' might be a truer characterization. A successful biographer somehow transcends his own being in order to comprehend the life of his subject and illuminate it as if from within. In fact, some biographers become so obsessed with their subjects that their lives are overrun by the persons they are examining. That the relationship is invariably close cannot be ignored; the feeling of ''living with'' their subjects appears to be the standard description offered when biographers discuss their work.",1981-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Britain's tactics for Mideast peace, which are strongly opposed by Washington, were described by London officials as ''the natural outgrowth of a basically different assessment of what will work best.'' The difference, they said, goes back to 1978, when Western European officials reacted with private skepticism to the Camp David accords because they believed the agreements failed to provide a framework for a resolution of the problem of the Palestinian Arabs.

He was the only Beatle who remained immune to the expectations of cosmic significance that were hung like millstones on the other three.

He certainly was the only one who could get away with singing cheerful nonsense songs of no great consequence; when the others tried it, they were accused of selling out. Ringo was free to be a pop star, pure and simple, and to exercise his comic talents in a series of film roles.

us,PERSONAL HEALTH,"OTHER than wisdom teeth, I have lost one permanent tooth, and I have shoddy dentistry and myself to blame for it. I was camping in the wilderness out West when the tooth began to throb. The California dentist I finally saw shook his head in dismay: the tooth had decayed so extensively beneath a crown that it could not be saved. The crown had been made some years earlier by a neighboorhood dentist who functioned more like a short-order cook than a careful health professional. He ''worked'' at least three patients at a time, frenetically flitting from one treatment room to another, doing a little bit on one patient, then another, while a full waiting room kept on the pressure for speed. It was hardly the setting for careful dentistry. But it was close to home and swift, the fees were moderate and the dentist kept up a friendly chatter that took your mind off the inevitable discomfort. The price I paid for this convenience - besides the pain, a fixed bridge with two crowns to support it, requiring many weeks of treatment and hundreds of dollars - was hardly worth it.Even more than with medicine, consumers of dental care are hard put to evaluate the competence of the practitioner. A medical patient who does not get well or suffers frequent recurrences or mishaps from treatment may get suspicious about a doctor. But the hallmarks of careless dentistry are rarely obvious to the patient, at least not immediately.",1981-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Urging that both Washington and Moscow act to avoid ''the dread threat of nuclear war,'' he announced he had proposed to the Kremlin cancellation of plans for new American intermediate-range missiles in Europe in return for the dismantling of comparable Soviet nuclear forces. (Page A1, Column 6.) Moscow dismissed the arms proposals offered by President Reagan as a ploy designed to scuttle the Geneva talks on controls and to blunt the antinuclear movement in Western Europe. A dispatch by Tass questioned Mr. Reagan's assertion that Moscow was superior in mediumrange weapons and called his figures ''fantastic.'' (A1:5.)",1981-11-19T05:00:00+0000

While there are some plans for new construction, most sites on which large-scale development can take place are already built up - so the rustic illusion that the hidden Riverdale offers is not likely to disappear and that alone makes this part of New York special.",1981-11-20T05:00:00+0000

What I didn't have was a current photo of myself, and a kind, but insistent, civil servant explained that the gallery of any large Metro station would be the best place to have one made. Seeing, however, that my hours in the library were to be limited, she allowed me a temporary card on the condition that I would have my picture within three days. With my papers under my arm, I started up the austere marble staircase to the manuscript room, the mecca for a certain elite of scholars. The ceilings are two stories high with ancient leather-bound volumes lining one long side and French windows on the other. Curved boiseries with intricate flowers, leaves and the crests of nobles from the times of Richelieu and Voltaire separate atlases from dictionaries, scriptures from myths, ancient histories from psalters. A squeaky ladder that rolls along a railing allows the blue-coated functionaries to climb up and fetch down books. The long tables are covered with red leather, bordered in light-colored wood worn smooth by centuries of leaning elbows, and the caned seats of the carved armchairs sag from years of scholarly bottoms.",1981-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Photography View; CINDY SHERMAN: A PLAYFUL AND POLITICAL POST-MODERNIST,"When photography entered the discourse and marketplace of the art world in the 1970's it did so largely on the basis of its modernist momentum. Photographers took pains to stress their interest in the formal properties of their medium, investigating ''problems'' of time, tone, space and framing in the Bauhaus spirit of Moholy-Nagy. At about the same time, paradoxically, artists outside the photographic tradition were taking up the camera for radically different reasons. It was used to furnish visual documentation of relatively inaccessible or ephemeral art works, such as Robert Smithson's ''Spiral Jetty'' or Christo's ''Valley Curtain,'' or as a source of predigested imagery for certain representational painters, such as Chuck Close, or as a kind of shorthand notebook for Conceptual artists on the order of John Baldessari, Robert Cumming and William Wegman. In short, while photographers were involved with photographic form, artists in revolt against abstract and Minimalist art became enamored of photography for its content.",1981-11-22T05:00:00+0000

They celebrated Nick Shuk Day at Laurel last week, calling the feature the Nick Shuk Purse and naming the other races for horses that meant something special in his career -Pilaster, Little Harp, Sailor, Tuscany, Brazen Brat, Damascus, Saratoga and Sunglow. Little Harp, owned by the Pittsburgh Steelers' proprietor, Art Rooney, was Shuk's first winner, in 1948, when Nick was apprenticed to Rooney's Shamrock Farm. Rooney gave Nick a watch on that occasion and, assuming the boy was Irish, had it engraved ''Keep the faith.''",1981-11-25T05:00:00+0000

This was the Indiana Democrat's first visit back since he moved last summer, and while it did not allow time to visit Tip O'Neill and other beloved cronies at the House, it did provide a handy forum at Georgetown University for Mr. Brademas to speak and to ''blister,'' as he put it, the Reagan Administration's dismantling of higher education programs that Mr. Brademas helped write as Congressman. Except for his direct concern, education, Mr. Brademas said he was ''not popping off'' in the political field, although he had found ''it is not really quite so far from Washington D.C. to Washington Square as you might imagine.''

us,A NEW WAY OF HANDLING CHILD CUSTODY,"Charles Rothenberg, author of ''Matrimonial Allowances in New York,'' has specialized in the practice of family law for almost 40 years. By Charles Rothenberg The prize-winning motion picture ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' reminded us that perhaps no legal battles are fraught with more bitterness, controversy and heartbreak than are child-custody cases. Yet at a time when one out of three marriages is doomed to failure and court calendars seem clogged with such cases, no new method for dealing with this human tragedy has been put forth. The question remains: Who is best able to decide what is right for the beleaguered child in such cases? Under present law, the role of deciding between two contesting parents still falls entirely to a judge, and once the judge decides what is best for the child, nothing else matters - certainly not the child's wishes - as a relatively recent spate of court rulings shows: In a 1977 Illinois case, Imes v. Imes, a 16-year-old girl told the judge that she did not love her father, could not get along with him and wanted to live with her mother. She was awarded to the father. In the 1977 Pennsylvania case of Tomlinson v. Tomlinson, a court made an award of a 13-year-old girl to her mother despite the child's stated preference for her father. The decision was made without consideration of a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation. A year ago, in a Washington case, four children of the Hadeen family, ranging in age from 5 to 15 years, were awarded to their mother, a religious zealot whose sect permitted, as a means of gaining parental control, ''beatings, vile language and lying to nonbelievers'' as well as enforced isolation and fasting.",1981-11-29T05:00:00+0000
