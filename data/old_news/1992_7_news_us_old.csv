The olives and their extra virgin oil claim the only appellation d'origine in the world. This guarantees the variety of olive --where it was grown, how it was cultivated; it also guarantees that the olives were cured only in sea salt and water and that the oil was extracted from the first cold pressing.",1992-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Norman's lead over Duffy Waldorf was cut to one when he missed a two-and-a-half-foot par putt on the final hole. The bogey put him at 205 through three rounds, or 11 under par on the 7,073-yard Dubsdread course. At this tournament last year, Norman took a five-shot lead into the last eight holes but had a 41 on the back nine and lost by two shots. Waldorf, the runner-up at last week's Buick Classic, scrambled to a 70 that included a 35-foot par putt on the 11th hole. Jeff Sluman shot a nine-under-par 63 that broke the course record set by Robert Gamez in 1989. Sluman and Ben Crenshaw are tied for third at 207.

us,Adams in Eden,"One might overlook the fact that Ansel Adams's monumental photographs of the national parks are essentially evangelistic -- unabashed attempts to convert the American public, the National Park Service and various American Presidents to his faith in nature. As William A. Turnage, a former president of the Wilderness Society, writes in the preface to OUR NATIONAL PARKS (Little, Brown, paper, $16.95), Adams's ""passion for wilderness was his substitute for a belief in God and organized religion."" Adams himself, who died at the age of 82 in 1984, admitted as much: ""I am frankly, and perpetually, an evangelist."" Once you realize this, it is hard to ignore the religious quality of his black-and-white studies of more than 40 national parks (including Glacier, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, Death Valley and Yosemite), which were selected for this volume by Andrea G. Stillman, the editor of several of Adams's previous books, and by Mr. Turnage. These idealized images, with their perfect symmetry and their perfect balance of light and dark, are really, as Mr. Turnage notes, Adams's cathedrals, places where someone could learn to appreciate the vastness of nature without feeling like a foreigner. Lest one need further proof of that, here is Adams's pithy response to a proposal that a dam be constructed in part of the Grand Canyon, leaving a lake for tourists to raft on: ""I suggest we fill the Sistine Chapel about two-thirds full of water so that visitors can float around and see the ceiling paintings to better advantage.""",1992-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Crenshaw used a late, two-stroke swing to leap-frog over Norman and claim his first victory since 1990. Norman's two-year non-winning string was extended with a second consecutive galling, frustrating runner-up finish in this event. Crenshaw came to the final hole needing a par to stay in front of the grim-faced Norman, and he sank a 5-foot second putt to do so. Norman, playing behind him, then needed a birdie on the 18th to force a tie. He got his approach about 20 feet below the hole. His birdie putt stopped inches short, and the non-winning string kept running. Crenshaw finished with a 69 and a 276 total, 12-under par on the Dubsdread course at the Cog Hill complex. The victory was worth $198,000. (AP) Sheehan Wins 2d Straight Tournament: Patty Sheehan won the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic by a stroke to take her second title in a week and become the only two-time winner this season on the L.P.G.A. Tour. Sheehan shot a five-under-par 66 to finish with a four-under 209 over the 6,270-yard, par-71 Highland Meadows Golf Club in suburban Toledo, Ohio. Tied for second were Brandie Burton, Heather Drew, Tammie Green and the second-round leader, Deb Richard. Sheehan shot a 3-under 31 on the front nine and followed that up with a 2-under 35 on the back nine. Richard started with a triple-bogey 7 on the first hole and never recovered. She finished with a 73. Drew was the leader at 5-under after six holes of the final round but had three bogies and one birdie the rest of the way. Sheehan earned $60,000 of the $400,000 purse. She also earned $60,000 last week for winning the Rochester International. (AP) Gilbert Holds Off Snead: Gibby Gilbert out-dueled J. C. Snead in a twilight playoff to win the $600,000 Kroger Senior Classic in Mason, Ohio. With darkness closing in after a 1-hour, 40-minute rain delay, Gilbert sank a five-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole, the 546-yard, par-5 No. 18, to win his second straight Senior PGA Tour championship. Gilbert had a final-round 68 and Snead a 67 to finish the 54 holes at 15-under 198. Gilbert won the Southwestern Bell Classic last week with a 17-under score. Lee Trevino, who had a hole-in-one after the rain delay, shot 66 to finish third, three strokes back. Thirty-five players beat par for the 54-hole tournament. (AP) AUTO RACING Mansell Drives to Grand Prix Victory Nigel Mansell of Britain won the rain-interrupted French Grand Prix yesterday, his sixth victory in eight races this season. Mansell finished in 1 hour 38 minutes 8.459 seconds, beating his Williams-Renault teammate Riccardo Patrese of Italy by 46.447 seconds. They were well ahead of the field as rain plagued the race over the last 30 laps. Martin Brundle of Britain finished third overall in a Benetton-Ford. Rain stopped the race for about 20 minutes during the 20th lap. The cars restarted at the positions they held after 18 laps, with Patrese holding a lead of .935 seconds over Mansell. The restart reduced the race from 72 laps to 69. At the end of the first lap of the restart, Patrese waved his Williams teammate past him, giving Mansell the overall lead at lap 21. (AP) SOCCER Croatia Loses in International Debut Defender Andrew Marth scored in the 65th minute yesterday as Croatia lost to Australia, 1-0, in its first international soccer game, in Melbourne, Australia. Croat fans clashed briefly with Serbian protesters before the match. Serbs gathered in downtown Melbourne to protest the Croatian team's presence in Australia. Objects were thrown and scuffles broke out, but no arrests were made, and the police reported no serious injuries. The 12,000 spectators were searched before entering the grounds. (AP) BASKETBALL German Team Gains Olympic Berth Germany defeated Czechoslovakia, 90-74, yesterday in Zaragoza, Spain, to join Lithuania, Croatia and the Commonwealth of Independent States as Europe's representatives in the basketball tournament in the Barcelona Olympics. Amazingly, none of the four teams existed in their present form two years ago, if they existed at all. Croatia will be making its Olympic debut, and Lithuania has never competed in the Olympic basketball tournament. The C.I.S. -- the name of what remains of the former Soviet Union -- is technically the defending Olympic champion. Indiana Pacers forward Detlef Schrempf scored 23 points to lead the Germans in the opening game at the Prince Felipe Pavillion, but the team needed to wait out the C.I.S.'s 84-82 victory over Slovenia before knowing it had qualified for the first time in its history. Germany automatically took part in 1936 and 1972 Olympics as the host nation and was added in 1984 in Los Angeles to fill out the field following the Soviet-led boycott.

The world champion, Yobes Ondieki of Kenya, ran the season's fastest men's 5,000 meters in 13 minutes 3.58 seconds in another standout showing at the Athletissima Grand Prix track meet in Lausanne, Switzerland. Drechsler, 27 years old, a former world record-holder, threatened the current mark of 24-8 1/4 set by Galina Chistyakova of the Soviet Union on June 11, 1988. Yesterday's performance equaled the second-longest leap ever, by Drechsler herself in 1988. Chistyakova was fifth yesterday, jumping 21-2 3/4. Drechsler, a former East German, continued an astounding comeback after giving birth to a son in late 1989, confirming her status as the favorite for Olympic gold. (AP) TENNIS No. 871 Stuns Wheaton Brian MacPhie, an amateur, scored a stunning upset over top-seeded David Wheaton in the second round of the $175,000 Hall of Fame tennis championships in Newport, R.I. MacPhie, ranked a lowly No. 871 in the world, was the beneficiary of a miserable performance from the service line by the 41st-ranked Wheaton and advanced to his first career quarterfinal with the 6-4, 7-6 victory. The only men's tournament played on grass in the United States lost another seeded player in second-round action when seventh- seeded Luis Herrera of Mexico fell to the Australian qualifier Neil Borwick, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6). The 275th-ranked Borwick next plays MacPhie. Wheaton made his professional debut at Newport in 1988 and reached the Wimbledon semifinals in 1991, but it was MacPhie, the No. 1 singles player at the University of Southern California, who looked more at home on the grass courts of the Newport Casino.(Reuters) Gomez Is Injured Top-seeded Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia advanced to the second round of the rain-plagued Swiss Open at Gstaad yesterday while Andres Gomez suffered an injury that may knock him out of the Olympics. Gomez, 32 years old, retired in the first set against Thomas Muster of Austria after he slipped on the wet court and suffered torn ligaments in his right ankle. The Ecuadorean, who trailed, 5-6, at the time, was taken to a hospital. Korda, ranked fifth in the world, beat Horacio de la Pena of Argentina, 4-6, 6-2, 6-0.

Absent are the yachts and package tours and the affluent British who built Madeira into a luxury winter resort with hotels like Reid's. At Porto Santo, boats fish for tuna, yoked oxen thresh grain and the donkey is still sometimes called upon to carry things.

us,Her Brilliant (but Brief) Career,"During the 1930's, the Farm Security Administration hired photographers like Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans to document the plight of the rural poor. In LOOKING FOR THE LIGHT: The Hidden Life and Art of Marion Post Wolcott (Knopf, $35), Paul Hendrickson, a staff writer for The Washington Post, examines the life of a lesser-known F.S.A. photographer who worked for the agency from 1938 until 1942. Traveling alone almost without respite for four years, mostly in the South, but also in New England and the West, Marion Post Wolcott (1910-90) photographed miners, Saturday-night jitterbuggers, tinkers and farmers -- all of whom she portrayed with respect and compassion. She also spent time photographing, not so sympathetically but with no less grace, rich people in Florida and Virginia. In 1941 she got married, and shortly afterward she left the agency and absented herself from the world of professional photography until historians rediscovered her work in the 1970's. Therein lies the root of her long obscurity and the central problem for her biographers. Why did she stop, what role did the responsibilities of family life play, and what does that tell us about the lives of women artists? To address these questions, Mr. Hendrickson has written a New Age sort of biography, long on feeling and personal history, short on the conventions of chronology and research. The book has no footnotes, no bibliography, no index, and therefore no guideposts for others who might want to know more about Wolcott's life and times.",1992-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Brown Jr. continued to withhold an endorsement of Gov. Bill Clinton.

A3 HOW LONG A HONEYMOON? News Analysis: Yitzhak Rabin's first pronouncements are being warmly welcomed, domestically and in Washington, after years of Likud Party rule, but can he live up to everyone's expectations? A3 THE GULF WAR OF WILLS Braving 140-degree heat -- in air-conditioned jeeps -- today's troops in the gulf are keeping vigil in a passive battle with Saddam Hussein over arms inspections. A3 PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE ON CONGRESS In a move that will have more impact on Capitol Hill than on nuclear tests, the Administration is establishing new limits on the nation's testing program. A5 SOME POWER SEEPS INTO SARAJEVO Limited electricity and water were restored to hospitals and communications centers in parts of Sarajevo after Serbian forces blew up four transmission lines. A6 Milan Panic, new Yugoslav Premier, says Bosnia is independent. A6 More than 4,000 shells don't break the will of Dubrovnik. A6 A doctor's report is expected on the Pope's condition. A4 The Convention A7-13 DEMOCRATS PLEDGE 'A REVOLUTION' With the last challenge to Governor Clinton's hegemony fading, the least contentious, most confident Democratic National Convention in years adopted a platform fashioned to match his prescription for victory in November. A1 The platform: conservative words to a liberal tune. A1 Excerpts from the platform. A10 JACKSON AND A WATERSHED In the end, Jesse Jackson faced up to political reality. He appeared on the podium of the Democratic National Convention on Governor Clinton's terms, and he did so when the party chairman told him to. A1 The party grudingly yielded Brown 20 minutes at the podium. A13 CLINTON AND ABORTION Governor Clinton's heavily scripted convention schedule was marred by an anti-abortion protester who thrust a fetus in a plastic container at him. That gesture of protest came on a day when abortion opponents in Arkansas distributed a 1986 letter in which Mr. Clinton wrote that ""I am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortion."" A11 THE HOUR OF TRUTH Since its creation, the Democratic Leadership Council has argued that it understands how to put a Democrat back into the White House. Now it will be put to the test. A7 BROADCAST NEWS In the control rooms at the television networks, the struggle is to get some drama instead of settling for what the Democratic Party wants: pretty pictures and snappy sound bites. Nowhere has that struggle been more acute than at CNN. A8 AIDS PROTESTERS MARCH Sending a loud plea to Democrats gathered in Madison Square Garden, more than 10,000 people marched from Columbus Circle to Times Square and demanded better health care for AIDS patients. A9 THE RESCUE OF THE PRESIDENT Political Memo: President Bush will spend the next two days at the Wyoming ranch of a longtime confidant, Secretary of State Baker. And the fondest hope of many Republicans is that the two men will decide there that Mr. Baker should take on the job of rescuing the President's re-election effort.

But before the pills could be returned to her, an appeals court ordered a delay. The issue will go to the Supreme Court today. A1 SPLIT RULING ON ENVIRONMENT A Federal appeals court ruled that the E.P.A. must review its 1990 decision, ordered by the Competitiveness Council, that allowed lead automobile batteries to be burned in municipal incinerators.

A9 WEST SEEMS SHY ABOUT BOSNIA News Analysis: It seems increasingly clear that neither the United States nor the rest of the West appears ready to authorize the kind of military action that might save the beleaguered Bosnians. A8 CROATIA'S PLEA, AND THREAT In an effort to goad Western countries into doing more to help it cope with the greatest surge of refugees in Europe since World War II, Croatia has warned its neighbors that it will transport refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and leave them on Europe's borders.

A4 The Convention A11-17 THE CORONATION OF CLINTON With the blessings of the party's liberal wing, the Democratic National Convention sent Governor Clinton into an unpredictable battle for the Presidency. A1 A PARADE OF NOT-QUITE-NOMINEES News analysis: For a few fleeting moments, the convention's managers let Democrats be Democrats. Here came to the rostrum people named Brown, Kennedy, Tsongas and Cuomo. These were the losers, the men not nominated, the paths not taken, and there were contradictions aplenty. A1 The text of Cuomo's nominating speech. A14 Finding the right state to nominate the candidate. A12 'IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL' Man in the News: Persistence is a theme of Governor Clinton's life, and it may be the reason why, only four years after one of the worst speeches in recent convention history, he won his party's nomination. A1 Every step of the way, a persistent staff as well. A11 For Clinton's mother, trials and now triumph. A11 NEW YORK JOINS THE BANDWAGON This is not the ticket that many New York delegates would have envisioned themselves endorsing. But with Governor Cuomo orphaned by self-doubt, the state's Democrats are papering over their differences and their own doubts in unusual appeals for unanimity that could be crucial to the Clinton campaign. A13 THIS IS NEW YORK? The 24 delegates from Montana have been roaming fearlesslessly around town since Saturday, from their hotel on East 50th Street to the Blue Note in Greenwich Village to Madison Square Garden. And everywhere they go, proclaming ""Hi, we're from Montana,"" New Yorkers are, yes, nice to them. A13 AND WHICH CONVENTION IS THIS? In the end, the impression of the convention that will be left with the folks back home is likely to depend on one factor beyond the party's control: which television station they happen to be watching.

Helping him along were a few hired political guns and friends going back decades. IN SWITCH, DEMOCRATS ACT LIKE DEMOCRATS . . . For a few sweet moments, the managers of the convention let the Democrats be Democrats. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo set the place afire with his endorsement of Bill Clinton, while former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas laid out their idiosyncratic prescriptions for the party. And, once more, Senator Edward M. Kennedy evoked the glow of Camelot. EXPECT NO EXPOSES ON DNC-TV Don't look for a lot of hard-hitting reports from the Convention Satellite News Service.

Nowhere is it mentioned whether permission to use the land was obtained when this was possible, whether care was taken not to leave litter behind, or whether it was ascertained that making a campfire entailed no risk of forest fire.

These writers, careful while the Communist Party was in power, were a long way from being old-guard writers, and showed how the institute had changed since the days when only Socialist Realism was allowed.

More Than Her Message","Self-consciously distancing herself from the avant-garde movements of her time, Kathe Kollwitz (1867-1945) rejected modernism's tenets of social transgression, formal invention and heroic individualism, choosing instead to work in a direct and legible figurative style and to present her images to a broad audience through printmaking. Troubled by what she perceived as a tendency toward elitist estheticism in the work of the German Expressionists, Kollwitz used simplified and affecting means to represent the extreme suffering that she witnessed as a resident of Berlin during two world wars. These representations, charged with protest, are particularly directed against the oppression of women. The critical reception of Kollwitz's work has always emphasized its political implications, and in recent years feminist art historians, including Alessandra Comini, the author of one of the essays in KATHE KOLLWITZ (Yale University, $45), have discussed Kollwitz's role as an early voice of feminism. Elizabeth Prelinger suggests in the main essay that the politicizing of Kollwitz has detracted from formal and technical analyses of her work. Arguing that by exaggerating Kollwitz's political commitments and her feminist stance, previous criticism has rendered her something of a symbolic figure, Ms. Prelinger, who teaches fine arts at Georgetown University, attempts to restore the artist's reputation as a practitioner. She also provides a careful and detailed reconstruction of Kollwitz's complex experiments with a range of printmaking methods, and a welcome close reading of the pictorial means she used to frame ""the rhetoric of her powerful images.""",1992-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,City of Lights and Cameras,"Henri Cartier-Bresson often viewed his photographs upside down, to see if they stood the test of form. The war photographer Robert Capa believed in shots taken purely on impulse. Brassai made his name photographing the low life of Paris at night; Lee Miller, an American photographer for Vogue, made her reputation for her scenes of the blitz in London. These well-known facts pepper the less than revelatory text of PARIS: The City and Its Photographers (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $35), an illustrated history of photography that begins with the invention of the daguerreotype in Paris in 1839 and closes with the fashion photographers of the late 1950's and 60's. It is Paris and its pivotal role in the development of photography, however, that Patrick Deedes-Vincke, a photographers' agent, attempts to make the central focus of his story -- a guiding theme that at times seems forced. Happily, the 100 handsome duotone photographs more than compensate for the uninspired text. Early daguerreotypes of medieval Paris are followed by marvelous turn-of-the-century shots of public baths, the races at Auteuil and a varied cast of street vendors, shopkeepers and anglers on the Seine. Grainy photographs of griffins and gargoyles taken from the heights of the Cathedral of Notre Dame precede lonely scenes of the Champs-Elysees, a particularly startling shot of the Rue de Rivoli hung with Nazi flags, and graphically bold billboards from the late 40's -- all of which make the book a wonderful nostalgic tour of the city.",1992-07-26T05:00:00+0000
