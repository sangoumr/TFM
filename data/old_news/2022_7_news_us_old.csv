Ghazal literally means the cry of a gazelle as it is being chased and about to die. Like many formal poems such as the sonnet, the ghazal, with its restrictions, can paradoxically illuminate and parse difficult emotions. In Lpezs poem, the emotion is grief  a longing for and memory of a murdered brother. This poem mostly follows the parameters of a ghazal with its repeated end word, song, and the inside rhyme of forever, far, marred, etc., as well as the poets name or reference to the poet (Sister) in the final line. One way this poem breaks the rules is that each couplet doesnt stand alone as if it were its own poem. Instead, the end of the couplets often bleed into the next stanza, linking the narratives.

But we hold on to the idea that society got freer during our generation (whatever that means) because we want our own youthful indiscretions to have pushed boundaries (another useless phrase) and changed the scope of what was possible (ditto).

us,Asian American Student Success Isnt a Problem,"Over the past three years, as universities across the country have abandoned standardized test requirements and moved toward more holistic models for admission, a persistent yet largely unexamined question has arisen: Would these changes be happening if white students were at the top of the academic food chain? The performance gap between Asian American and white high school students on standardized tests has grown over the past decade. In 2018, for example, Asian American students, on average, scored 100 points higher on the SAT than white students. Just three years later, in 2021, that gap had risen by over 25 percent, to 127. Many of the universities that have dropped the SAT requirement have cited a desire for diversity and equity and a de-emphasis on hard-core academic competition. (This has always struck me as errant and, frankly, self-serving reasoning. If elite colleges actually want economically and racially diverse campuses free from the academic stressors that plague high school students, they should take their own advice and stop competing so fiercely to prove that they are the most exclusive places of higher learning in the world.)",2022-07-14T20:15:06+0000

Mr. Musks lawyers said on Friday that Twitters request in the suit for an expedited trial in September was unreasonable and asked to delay it. When, and if, the case goes to trial, a judge in Delawares Court of Chancery will decide whether Mr. Musks claims that Twitter withheld information about spam accounts on the site are valid. The two parties could also settle, with Mr. Musk paying damages. Or, if his financing falls through, he could get out of the deal by paying a $1 billion breakup fee. Another possibility still is that Mr. Musks threat to walk away spooks Twitter into renegotiating with him, which could result in his buying the company at a discount.

us,A View From the Right on Progressives Moral Crusade,"For years, Republicans have been known as the party of moral outrage. Take for instance the recent book banning wars, or Floridas Dont Say Gay bill. But Democrats arent immune to moral outrage. At least thats what Noah Rothman, a conservative writer and commentator, believes. He is the author of the new book The Rise of the New Puritans: Fighting Back Against Progressives War on Fun. In it, he argues that progressives, in their pursuit of liberal ideals, are fueling a movement of moral panics more reminiscent of 17th-century preachifying than 1960s liberalism  and that were all worse off for it.",2022-07-20T09:00:10+0000

us,"Chance, Design and Inevitability in Three New Poetry Books","Some people believe that before we are born, we choose our own parents. In a poem called The First Number Will Be a Blues, Sommer Browning describes one version of this story: Before were born, my mother tells us, / We watch movies of every life we might be born into. Then we choose. / The little baby points from her / astral cradle. The speaker marvels at the implications: I choose that mama. / I choose that daddy. / I choose that irrevocably broken marriage, / That accident that wires my jaw shut, / That burned popcorn  the litany continues  That root canal, that unending night on mushrooms, / That dog bite. That DUI. Is it absurd to imagine we select our own pattern of suffering, or that we might have picked a life without any? As Willard Spiegelman notes in his book Seven Pleasures, Hap means chance. Happiness and happen share the same root. Whether we choose them or not, the random happenings of our lives, good and bad, are our own. The details that add up to days and years  your street name, your first word, your favorite podcast  have what Ernest Becker might have called a cosmic specialness.",2022-07-20T09:00:11+0000

A big year was 1984, with the openings of the Sea Grill and American Festival Cafe by Restaurant Associates. This year promises to be notable as well, with Tishman Speyer, the company that owns and operates Rockefeller Center, continuing to shape the dining scene. A major addition is Le Rock, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasrs grand interpretation of a French brasserie. (Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr, veterans of Balthazar, own Frenchette in TriBeCa and have Le Veau dOr on the Upper East Side in the wings.) With Workstead, a Brooklyn interior design studio, they have incorporated enough Art Deco features to anchor the soaring room to its historic setting. A verdigris screen separates the bar, terrazzo floors are new but dont look it and bare burled wood tables sit at forest-green leather banquettes. Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have to fill 130 seats indoors with another 70 on the terrace, and, to do so, especially with a potential tourist audience, they have given an international spin to the menu. Weve gone simpler than Frenchette, which has its own personality, Mr. Hanson said. Mr. Nasr cited some classic brasserie items, like leeks vinaigrette, escargots, pt maison and steak au poivre (made with bison). They share a menu, divided into Cette Semaine (weekly specials) and Tout le Temps (every day), which also lists falafel, a brochette of calamari and shishito peppers, and barbajuans, a kind of fried ravioli. Some items play it coy, using untranslated French names, like tablier de sapeur (breaded tripe) and cervelle de canut (fresh herbed cheese). In charge of the kitchen as executive chef is Walker Stern, a former owner of Battersby and Dover in Brooklyn. Mariah Neston is collaborating with Michelle Palazzo, the head pastry chef, on site to create a giant baba au rhum carved tableside.

I Want Restitution.,"I regularly travel between Houston and Atyrau, Kazakhstan (via Newark and Amsterdam) for work, taking United for the first two legs and Air Astana for the third. The trip is long but the routine is always the same: check your luggage in Texas and pick it up upon arrival. But this past January, United didnt follow the routine: When I boarded in Newark, I saw on the United app that at least one of my bags had stayed behind. I alerted the flight attendant, who alerted the gate staff, who in turn suggested I get off the plane, get my luggage and fly the next day. But there are limited connections, I had to get to work and I had no idea where my second bag was. (Also lost, it turns out.) Thirteen days and countless calls and letters later, Astana delivered my luggage in Kazakhstan. United eventually offered me $150 in compensation. I believe this is not nearly enough, especially considering their policy on delayed bags says I may be eligible for $1,500 per bag if they cant find my luggage in five days. Can you help?
