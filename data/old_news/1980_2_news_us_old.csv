us,"Screen: 'American Gigolo,' a Southern California Melodrama:Gauging the Glitter","IN 1926, when a movie called ""Gigolo"" opened in New York, the reviewer for The New York Times felt compelled to issue the kind of warning to his readers that Steve Martin issues in ""The Jerk,"" just before he exposes the whole sordid business of cat-juggling. ""Gigolo,"" The Times man wrote, is about ""an insufferable Paris specimen who dances for money.""Customs change  but seldom for the better.Julian Kay, the title character in ""American Gigolo,"" Paul Schrader's hilariously bent new romantic melodrama, is to the art of the gigolo what the Cuisinart is to home cooking. He not only dances for money, but he also speaks French, Swedish and several other languages for pay. If a client books time in advance, he will talk dirty to her on the telephone. He gives advice on antiques and general pointers on interior decoration; he acts as a chauffeur; he dresses to the nines and exercises regularly so that, undressed, he still looks terrific, and, of course, he makes love on demand.This is obviously what Julian does best. He gives, gives, gives and, except for sizable amounts of cash and expensive presents, he asks nothing in return. Indeed  and this is Julian Kay's tragic secret as revealed by ""American Gigolo""  he is incapable of receiving the one thing that money cannot buy. Are you sitting down? Julian Kay, you see, is incapable of receiving love.You and I might think Julian Kay a pretty hopeless case, but Mr. Schrader, who wrote and directed ""American Gigolo,"" sees something fine and good and true behind all the glitter of Julian's life or, you might say, underneath all the elegance of Julian's clothes (designed by Giorgio Armani).For one thing, no matter how much money he's offered, Julian refuses to do what he calls ""fag tricks."" He also draws the line at ""kinky sex."" When, as happens on one occasion, Julian finds that he's been booked to perform in an elaborate S/M scene with the wife of the client, Julian almost refuses, but hating to waste his trip to Palm Springs, he stays on. Julian does his best to soothe the lady and to see that the manacles holding her to the bed aren't too tight.They don't make many guys like Julian, especially in Southern California, which is the film's setting. Nor do they make many serious movies as riotously mixed up as ""American Gigolo.""The film, which opens today at Loews State 1 and other theaters, is not unentertaining, if only because Mr. Schrader is so earnest and so sincere. The movie wears the rapt expression of a 14-year-old boy watching his very first porn film. The kid is giddy with excitement, horrified and completely confused.Mr. Schrader, who wrote and directed ""Hard Core"" and ""Blue Collar"" and did the original screenplay for Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver,"" is awfully good at establishing inarticulate, unknowing, self-deluding characters, but he's much less effective when It comes to shepherding these characters through the contingencies of the melodrama that is supposed to ennoble them or, at least, to reveal their unsuspected moral resources. There comes a point in ""American Gigolo"" when the movie resolutely takes off in one direction while the characters plod on in another.The early part of the movie is a lot like thumbing through a magazine at the barbershop. Employing pseudo-documentarylike detail, Mr. Schrader reveals for us the life and times of a successful, extremely expensive male prostitute as he goes about his business in and around Los Angeles. Julian lives in a fancy apartment, has between $20,000 and $30,000 in the bank, drives a Mercedes convertible and is adored by the aging, wealthy clients he escorts to fancy restaurants, to country clubs that may still be restricted and to art galleries, activities that are a sort of foreplay when you're in Julian's line of work.Julian hustles through pimps who split with him 40-60 (in the pimp's favor) at the start, then 50-50 when Julian finally realizes they need him more than he needs them.Mr. Schrader so effectively convinces us that Julian has no past and no future, only an unsubstantial present, that the movie becomes ludicrous when it asks us to believe that Julian could be transformed by the plot, which has to do with the love of a good woman and a murder, for which Julian is being framed.The members of the cast do not do badly, considering the material they've been given and the mixture of solemnity and awe with which Mr. Schrader regards the scene. Hector Elizondo is extremely good as the slob detective whose job is to nail the murder rap to Julian. Lauren Hutton manages to look simultaneously beautiful and worn as a California politician's wife who comes to Julian as a client and stays on to love him. Nina Van Pallandt appears as one of Julian's pimps, a pleasantly menacing woman who is, apparently, a lesbian  the movie contains something to offend almost everyone except, possibly, the lunatic fringe of the women's liberation movement.Richard Gere, who received excellent notices for his performance in the Broadway play ""Bent,"" has what is probably an impossible assignment. Julian Kay is someone of absolutely no visible charm or interest, and though Mr. Gere is a handsome, able, low-key actor, he brings no charm or interest to the role. Then, too, the camera is not kind to him. It's not that he doesn't look fine, but that the camera seems unable to find any personality, like Dracula, whose image is unreflected by a mirror. Mr. Gere stands in front of the camera, but when the film is developed, the essential image has vanished.",1980-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Malcolm McDowell In Bob Guccione 'Caligula':The Cast,"Caligula, the fourth of the 12 Caesars, came to power in A.D. 37 and was assassinated three years, 10 months and eight days later, at the age of 29. Like A. A. Milne's King John, Caligula was not a good man. He was vain, brutal, whimsical, extravagant and, as Seutonius puts it, ""He had not the slightest regard for chastity, either his own or others.""It's this last failing that is the principal concern of ""Caligula,"" the new movie that was not written by Gore Vidal and was not directed by Tinto Brass. They had their names removed as the writer and the director of the picture some time ago, though they still show up in the credits, Mr. Vidal as the author of the original screenplay from which this movie was ""adapted,"" and Mr. Brass as the person responsible for ""principal photography.""The movie's ""additional scenes,"" which I assume are the hard core stuff, are said to have been directed and photographed by Giancarlo Lui and Bob Guccione, who is the film's co-producer as well as the publisher of Penthouse magazine.Like Caligula, the movie is an abrasive sort of orphan and, at $17 million, it must be the most expensive pornographic movie ever made. It features some very good, well known actors, including Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, none of whom performs pornographic duties, and many other people who do.Because Mr. Brass (""Madam Kitty."") is not a man of talent, while Mr. Vidal is, it's difficult to understand what Mr. Guccione originally hoped the film would be. The movie that opened yesterday at the Penthouse Theater (formerly the Trans-Lux East) looks like any number of other expensive, made-in-Rome spectacle-films. The sets are impressive, the sentiments suitably phony-pious (""What shall it profit a man to gain the world?"" asks an opening credit card), and the narrative skimpy. The film's action is entirely in its orgies, which are exhausting and solemn. The funniest thing in the movie is its musical theme, which sounds like a steal from Frank Sinatra's ""My Way,"" performed by some celestial symphony orchestra conducted by a cut-rate Andre Kostelanetz.Mr. O'Toole and Mr. Gielgud are responsible for some brief moments of intelligence and humor as, respectively, an ancient, dying, perfectly rotten Tiberius and Tiberius's honorable old minister Nerva. Mr. McDowell (Caligula) is out-of-control mad, almost from the start to the finish, and Miss Mirren, who plays Caligula's wife, Caesonia, truly seems to be acting when all around her are merely performing.It's not just the explicit sex that immediately identifies this as a pornographic picture. It's the marvelously flatfooted dialogue that is always a little out of sync with what we're seeing. ""Better be careful, sir,"" one courtier warns another very late in the game, after most of Rome has been defiled, deflowered, disemboweled or just sent to Gaul. ""He's in a strange mood tonight.""",1980-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: 'Silent Scream' of Horror:The Cast,"The only frightening thing about ""Silent Scream"" is that there are people who will pay $5 to see it. At least that's the price at Mann's National, Broadway and 43d Street, one of several theaters in the New York metropolitan area at which it opened yesterday. It won't take many customers for this cheap little horror picture to break even.Even teen-agers who would just as soon laugh at a flop and talk back to the screen as to quietly enjoy a good film are unlikely to find ""Silent Scream"" interesting. It's your basic haunted-house movie, with a homicidal maniac in the attic of the old clapboard house overlooking the Pacific killing the college students who are living there.Everything about the production is repulsively amateurish, and it is saddening to see performers like Yvonne De Carlo and Cameron Mitchell reduced to appearing in it.

Some are missionaries in what were once thought of as exotic, far-off places.The members of the Little Sisters of the Holy Family, an order of nuns that has its headquarters in Sherbrooke, Quebec, are something quite different. They dedicate themselves to serving God by serving His priests as cooks and housekeepers. They also drive cars, wash dishes, mend clothes, repair watches. No wives or mothers were ever so infused with the sense of mission that lights up the lives of these sisters, who, in Diane Letourneau's splendid documentary, ""The Handmaidens of God,"" define a special kind of liberation.Of course, one woman's liberation may be another's living hell. It is to the credit of ""The Handmaidens of God"" (""Les Servantes du Bon Dieu"") that it is enormously appreciative as well as clear-eyed and unsentimental. We never forget the exchanges that have been made to achieve such serenity. The movie, which is in French with English subtitles, opens tonight at the Film Forum, where it will be shown through Sunday at 7:45 P.M., and at the same hour next week, Thursday through Sunday.Though ""The Handmaidens of God"" is Miss Letourneau's first feature-length film (she was a psychiatric nurse for 10 years before becoming a film maker), it is a most accomplished piece of work. It reflects the modesty and sweetness of its subject in filmmaking ways that have to do with both discipline and technique.The Little Sisters of the Holy Family appear to be a dying order. The average age of the sisters is 65, and more than 200 of its 790 members are over 75. The order, founded in 1880, was once the logical choice for young women of poor, large, working-class or farm families. Today the young woman who elects to enter religious life is not likely to choose an order of nuns so wholeheartedly devoted to tasks considered menial.Miss Letourneau allows the nuns to speak for themselves in dozens of marvelously un-self-conscious interviews. There is a suggestion of blessed, eternal childhood in the way one elderly nun, who works in the laundry, fusses to fold a priest's handkerchief absolutely evenly. One nun, who is 82, recalls her entrance into the order when she was 14. There's a flicker of something dimly remembered when she tells us she wanted to get an education but was told, before making her final decision, that her education would be her devotion to her duties.The film attends a convent variety show that is put on by the sisters, including a one-nun band (harmonica and guitar). Mostly, though, the film is composed of the stories we see and hear. They are not all the same.One nun tells us she joined the order because she wanted to become a saint. ""I'm on my way,"" she says with the beginning of a smile. Another nun, who may or may not get along well with the other sisters, says, as if in self-defense, ""If I'm praised or blamed, it's all the same to me. All I care for is my soul.""""The Handmaidens of God"" is small-scale and fine.",1980-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Just Tell Me What You Want':Scrappers' Romance,"CAN this be love? Here is Ali MacGraw, beating Alan King to a pulp right in the middle of Bergdorf Goodman, kicking and flailing and breaking perfume bottles over his head. Audiences cheer this section of ""Just Tell Me What You Want"" more enthusiastically than they applaud any other part of the film. This is the high point of the story, the movie's only moment of real conviction. It might have made for an interesting ending, but it occurs midway through the tale, even though it's the kind of battle that, if this were a western, would leave one of the principals lying dead in the dust. It's a big scene thrown away. ""Just Tell Me What You Want"" isn't a movie with big scenes to spare.The rest of the film, after considerable meandering, reunites the two sluggers for a happy ending, as if Miss MacGraw's trying to fracture Mr. King's skull were a new variation on the art of playful romance. The audience, having enjoyed the battle scene, can't make a fast enough about-face to accept the couple's reconciliation, but this is the least of the audience's problems. Are the film's high-priced, venal, calculating wheeler-dealers to be admired? Is their acquisitiveness being ridiculed? Is a large art collection a sign of good character, or of any character at all? Sidney Lumet, the director of ""Network,"" and Jay Presson Allen, who wrote the screenplay, go through some potentially interesting motions, but they never take a stand.""Just Tell Me What You Want,"" which opens today at the Cinema II and other theaters, gets off to a fine, funny start and then falls to pieces. This is the second movie to open here in as many weeks  ""American Gigolo"" is the other  that approaches rich, decadent, hard-boiled characters with an attitude of star-struck ambivalence. Here, as in ""American Gigolo,"" we meet a glamorous social climber whose services are for hire. Miss MacGraw plays the favorite mistress of an extremely rich and powerful businessman, and Mr. Lumet's camera  like Paul Schrader's, in the other film  roams admiringly through her lair. In one scene, Miss MacGraw tosses her jewel collection onto the bed, to impress a new young suitor, just as lovingly as Richard Gere, in ""American Gigolo,"" admires the contents of his closet.Both of these characters sleep in large, airy, expensively decorated bedrooms that ought to suggest something about how these people feel or behave when they're alone, but instead say nothing at all. When Mr. Gere tells Lauren Hutton to stay out of his apartment because he doesn't let women visit this inner sanctum, and the place is as impersonally overdecorated as every other set in the movie, it's a terrible joke. Miss MacGraw's character, called Bones Burton, winds up with the same problem in ""Just Tell Me What You Want."" When she leaves Max Herschel, Mr. King's bullying tycoon, in favor of a younger, artier lover, played by Peter Weller, it's time for the real Bones to show. She never materializes  and without a suggestion of where Bones came from, or what she wants or cares about, or even why she's sold herself, the movie has nowhere to go.There's never any suggestion of what she might do outside the film's particularly unglamorous high-roller atmosphere  her most daring and independent act, during the course of the story, is to hock the jewels to finance her own little movie deal. This kind of finagling has none of the ""Network"" gloss, although that's the tone to which it apparently aspires. There's none of the overwrought passion that might balance out the characters' icy ambition. The dialogue, notably foulmouthed, merely reminds the viewer that these people's real sexuality is as absent from the film as any other sign of life.Because ""Just Tell Me What You Want"" begins so crisply, and because it features fine supporting performances from Keenan Wynn, Dina Merrill and especially Myrna Loy, it is by no means an uninteresting movie; in fact, it's a fascinating mess. Skittishness is no virtue. But the film is furiously confused, and its inconsistencies lie so close to the surface that they rivet the attention even when the story itself does not. Like his characters, Mr. Lumet is playing for sizable stakes, and the gamble has its appeal.",1980-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Greene Novel, Preminger Style:Double Agent's Story","MAURICE CASTLE (Nicol Williamson) has organized his life as if it were office routine, a series of tasks and responsibilities that are interrelated, though each remains separate from the others. When we first meet him in ""The Human Factor,"" Otto Preminger's film version of the Graham Greene novel, which has been adapted with extraordinary skill by Tom Stoppard, Maurice Castle seems still to be in charge of the various departments of his existence.He is a methodical man. He would never put something into a box marked Incoming when it was supposed to go into the one marked Outgoing. The attention Maurice Castle pays to details is that of an honorable, somewhat boring civil servant, which is what he appears to be. Yet something is not quite right.The opening sequences of ""The Human Factor"" are filled with gentle dread. Castle, a none-too-important functionary in the branch of British Intelligence that deals with African affairs, is called into his superior's office for a security check. Castle responds to the inquiry with good humor and a hint of impatience. It is, after all, his lunch hour and, in addition to eating, he'd planned to buy some cheese for his wife and some candy for his son, to whom he'd been disagreeable that morning. Castle is the sort of man who remains away from his desk at noon for no more than the prescribed hour, and this inquiry must be absorbed in that hour.In such fashion do Mr. Preminger and Mr. Stoppard, assisted by a splendid cast, introduce us to the world of Graham Greene's novel about a reluctant double agent, a fellow who has slipped into treason not for money or political principle, but for reasons that, tragically, confuse private and public loyalties.""The Human Factor,"" which opens today at the Plaza, is a fascinating, slightly chilly picture  as well as one of the best Preminger films in years. It is so good, in so many ways, that I think it's possible to say that, with several exceptions, its weaknesses are more those of Mr. Greene than of Mr. Preminger and Mr. Stoppard.""The Human Factor"" is not a conventional spy thriller though it uses a lot of the conventions, including secret agents, book stores that deal in things other than books, tapped phones, blackmail and murder. It's tone is consciously, calculatedly humdrum, shot through with dry wit and unexpected insights, much like Mr. Greene's prose. It's the story of a rather ordinary man who is approaching the safe end of his career, who loves his wife, a beautiful black African from South Africa, and his adopted son, and who must suddenly pay dearly for what were, we are told, nothing more than gestures of gratitude.It's also the story of Castle's associates in what's called ""the firm."" These include his younger associate, Davis (Derek Jacobi), a 40-ish bachelor for whom life in the firm is as boring as it would be in a real-estate agency; Percival (Robert Morley), the firm's merrily murderous doctor; and Daintry (Richard Attenborough), the man in charge of investigating the firm's security leak.The movie's flow is that of a novel more than of a film. Toward the middle there is a long flashback to Castle's tour of duty in Africa where he met and fell in love with his wife, Sarah, played by Iman, who looks (and, unhappily, acts) like the stunning fashion model she is. And the end of the movie, which is pure Greene, does not work especially well, possibly because the film, which has been shot mostly on locations in England and Africa, suddenly shifts to a not-very-convincing studio mockup of a shabby Moscow apartment.I also have reservations about the ""look"" of the film in general, that is, about Mike Molloy's photography. One can't be sure whether the straitened camera movements and the occasional gaffes in lighting are attempts to make visual Castle's interior panic or whether it's just sloppy movie making.Though Iman is clearly out of her depth in this film, the others are superb. Mr. Williamson, Mr. Morley, Mr. Attenborough and Mr. Jacobi have never been better. John Gielgud comes on for one short scene and the still-beautiful Ann Todd makes a brief but effective appearance as Castle's stiff-backed mother.For this film Mr. Stoppard, the Czech-born English playwright (""Night and Day,"" ""Travesties,"" etc.), has written another screenplay that should be studied by anyone interested in the problems of adapting for the screen novels of a more complex order than ""Jaws."" As Nabokov's voice can be heard in every line that Mr. Stoppard wrote for his adaptation of ""Despair"" for R. W. Fassbinder, Mr. Greene's voice can be heard in ""The Human Factor."" It's not a literal transcription, but it is so carefully done that I don't think one could be sure of Mr. Stoppard's ellipses and transpositions without putting the screenplay alongside the novel.",1980-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Reassurances Of 'Last Married Couple':Does Nothing Endure?,"JEFF AND MARI THOMSON (George Segal and Natalie Wood) think they are happy. He is a successful Los Angeles architect and she is a talented sculptor. They have three small sons who are reasonably normal and a circle of married friends who seem to be as happy as they are. When, two by two, their friends start splitting up and seeking divorces, the Thomsons are at first saddened, then worried and, finally, panicked.One day when Jeff returns early to their redwood-paneled, fully applianced house, he finds Mari on the verge of hysteria. She reports that their favorite fruit market is about to be torn down to make way for a service station. She has developed an extremely late case of acne and Donald and Reggie, the happy homosexuals down the block, are separating. That's the last straw. ""Everything seems disposable,"" Mari says, weeping. ""I feel that we must be the last married couple in America.""Gilbert Cates's ""The Last Married Couple in America,"" written by John Herman Shaner, belongs to that genre of popular comedy that examines faddish contemporary behavior to discover that traditional ways are still the best. Comedies of this sort, which include everything from ""Father Knows Best"" to ""La Cage aux Folles,"" are more often reassuring than funny. They tend to pull their punches. Almost from the beginning of ""The Last Married Couple in America"" we are aware that Jeff and Mari have to fight, split, taste the bleak pleasures of the so-called sexual revolution and then find some decent  and, we hope, amusing  way to get back together, as did Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in Leo McCarey's ""The Awful Truth.""""The Last Married Couple in America,"" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, owes less to Leo McCarey than it does to Paul Mazursky. Mr. Shaner's screenplay has the predictable rhythm of a television sitcom, with vast patches of predictable material between the occasional funny spots.Mr. Cates (""I Never Sang for My Father,"" ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams"") has no great gift for comedy, but he does have a gift for the right casting. All of the actors bring a great deal of class to their roles, large and small. Mr. Segal is no surprise as a first-rate comedian, but Miss Wood is. She not only looks terrific, she's extremely funny when she's not required to supply emotional bridges left out of the screenplay. Supporting Mr. Segal and Miss Wood with a wide variety of comic resources are Richard Benjamin, as Jeff's best friend, a sort of gloomy Angel of Divorce; Valerie Harper, as a predatory divorce who succeeds in starting a venereal disease epidemic in Beverly Hills; Dom DeLuise, as a plumber who moonlights as an actor in porn films, and Bob Dishy as what might be termed an ambulance-chasing divorce lawyer. He's always the first person to arrive at the house after the husband's departure.Some of the other good people are Arlene Golonka, Allan Arbus, Marilyn Sokol, Charlene Ryan (who's particularly funny as Mr. DeLuise's hooker-wife), and Mark Lonow and Sondra Currie, who play a wildly dopey couple from San Diego who've added new meaning to their marriage by husband-and-wife swapping.At its best, ""The Last Married Couple in America"" is updated ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice"" and, like the earlier film, it's cravenly faint-hearted. I simply do not believe, as this movie seems to think, that most married men who leave their wives after 10 years of marriage go immediately impotent. This is the sort of wishful thinking that sustains comedies like ""The Last Married Couple in America.""",1980-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Brave Beginnings of 'Hero at Large':Capt. Avenger Lives,"IF John Ritter weren't already a successful television star, he could become the greatest camp counselor this country has ever known. A nice smile, a sunny dispositon, a handsome haircut  really, Mr. Ritter has it all. He's adorable. And so is the first half of ""Hero at Large,"" a movie that's most successful when it concentrates on nothing weightier than Mr. Ritter's easygoing charm.After a while, ""Hero at Large,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, develops a plot and a message, which are more than it can manage, and it takes a disastrous turn. But it begins sweetly, and long after the material has run out of steam, Mr. Ritter is still going strong.In a welcome departure from the smirking, dopey doubletakes of ""Three's Company,"" Mr. Ritter this time plays a different kind of fool. He's a struggling young actor, and the screenplay allots him a pretty neighbor, a nasty landlady, a job impersonating Captain Avenger and a fair share of funny dialogue. Courting the pretty young woman across the hall (Anne Archer), he tells her he's been keeping an eye on her. ""I'm an actor, so I watch people,"" he explains. ""Haven't you got that backward?"" she inquires.The Captain Avenger job isn't much, and it isn't even exclusive; Mr. Ritter is seen visiting neighborhood movie theaters in a schoolbus with 61 other Avengers, all of them wearing the same silly outfit to promote a new movie starring ""Ryan McGraw."" But he plays the role for all it's worth, and more. ""It's just like any other part, you've got to really get into it,"" he explains. ""When I was at that theater, I was Captain Avenger."" The film, which is comfortably messy most of the time, is at its best when it makes fun of Mr. Ritter's earnestness and the acting profession simultaneously, as when it shows him trying to play a love scene in an audition session opposite a sad-looking, haggard bald man. He doesn't get the part.But meanwhile, back at home across the hallway, he gets the girl, wooing her away from a fellow named Milo. ""I found a stray,"" Miss Archer tells this soon-to-be-discarded steady, and indeed Mr. Ritter has a way of looking as if he'd fit right in at Bide-a-Wee. Surely this is not the stuff of which superheroes are made. But the plot calls for Mr. Ritter to foil a grocery-store robbery in his Avenger suit, and then become lionized by the press. Eventually, he becomes famous enough for Dr. Joyce Brothers to answer questions about him on a talk show. ""New York is going Captain Avenger crazy,"" says the host. ""Is this a good thing or a bad thing?"" ""Well, your question isn't really as simple as it sounds,"" Dr. Brothers replies.Success almost spoils him, but then it doesn't, and by then it's too late to care. ""Hero at Large"" has begun with a cornball conversation between a young couple, who are discussing her pregnancy  they turn out to be two actors rehearsing their lines. But by the end of the movie, the script is as clichd as anything it has made fun of, as when Miss Archer  restrained and quite appealing up until this point  bawls out Mr. Ritter for giving up his gumption. He is threatening to forget his whole Avenger escapade. ""I'll forget too,"" she cries. ""I'll forget I ever met you. We'll all forget you. We can forget anything, you know.""""Hero at Large"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains one bedroom episode, discreetly rendered, and a burning-building sequence that might frighten small children.",1980-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Discretion at 39 in Sautet's 'Simple Story':The Cast,"Largely because of the late, great, immortal Jack Benny, I can't hear someone say he's 39 without grinning in comic anticipation. No one, as Mr. Benny taught us, is ever seriously, certifiably 39. Being 39 is a joke, a vain attempt to stop time.This may explain part (though not all) of my skepticism about ""A Simple Story"" (""Une Histoire Simple""), a serious new film by Claude Sautet, the writer-director of, among other films, ""The Things of Life,"" ""Cesar and Rosalie"" and ""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others.""""A Simple Story"" is not a simple story, but there all irony ends. It is, instead, the discreetly poignant, mixed-up story of Marie who, at 39, must reexamine her life, the choices already made and those still to be faced. Marie is said to be a successful industrial designer, and though we see her looking very serious behind an easel, we never know what she is designing, as if that would be in some way indiscreet.We learn that Marie is 39 in discreet fashion  in the course of an interview with the doctor who's going to perform an abortion for Marie. This is a discreetly sad scene, and also a little unreal because Marie is played by Romy Schneider, a stunningly beautiful woman who is in her 40's but whose face suggests neither youth nor age but supernatural agelessness.Marie is vaguely discontented. Her 16-year-old son is growing up and away from her, as she knows he should, and she's in the process of splitting up with her lover Serge (Claude Brasseur), a foolish, weak man who doesn't measure up to Marie's ankles.Though we don't really believe it for a minute, Marie will grow old one day, and this has begun to haunt her. She knows there must be more to life than this, which is mainly what ""A Simple Story"" is all about. Because Mr. Sautet makes movies that are nothing if not discreetly realistic, we know that not much will have changed by the time Marie has weathered this particular crisis, except that she'll have grown up in some way that is photogenic but discreetly vague.Discretion, as you may have gathered by this time, is the operative word in Sautet films, which are hugely successful in France but which, with the exception of ""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others,"" tend to leave me unmoved and unconvinced. When I'm feeling depressed, I'm perfectly willing to admit that I've become too jaded by the rough-and-tumble of American films to respond to the subtleties of the Sautet work. When all is well, as right this minute, I'm convinced that Mr. Sautet's films are as empty, as I suspect, though they are attractively acted and mounted and sometimes unexpectedly cinematic in style.In the course of ""A Simple Story,"" there are lots of jolly get-togethers among Marie and her female friends, and among Marie and her female friends with their lovers and husbands. There are good times and bad on weekends in lovely country houses, happy-sad after-work drinks in favorite cafes, lovers' quarrels, discreet love scenes and one suicide. Marie and her ex-husband Georges (Bruno Cremer) have a brief affair, but the affair is an after-dinner brandy, not the introduction to a new meal. Food, its preparation and consumption, plays an important part in Sautet films.""A Simple Story,"" which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse, is a pretty movie, extremely well acted but anesthetizing. Mr. Sautet treats his characters as if they were gods, not (heaven knows) because they are powerful but because they are without connections to anything else. The world of his films is exactly the world seen by these people. There is nothing outside the movie frame.In serious movies, even if the scale is small and the method comic, we are aware of some larger scheme of things into which the characters fit. The people in ""A Simple Story,"" for all of the film's middle-class realism, are like the people in television commercials. They are contemporary myths.",1980-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Journeys From Berlin/1971':Avant-Garde Study,"FOR the first couple of minutes of ""Journeys From Berlin/1971,"" which opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema, sounds of running water and the murmur of voices are heard. The film is rolling, but the screen remains a restful dark gray.Gradually, gradations of tone, like those that characterize Ad Reinhardt's later paintings, and ripples and other minor imperfections in the screen itself become noticeable, although it may only be eyestrain.Whatever it is, it is a good deal less tiresome than the pastiche of nave and ignorant theorizing that follows about political events in West Germany in the past quarter century as seen from the point of view of the violent left. The heroes of the film are the Baader-Meinhof gang of terrorists.There are several recurrent, seemingly unconnected, scenes and images. A woman, Annette Michelson, who obviously is no actress, talks endlessly and without making much sense, with someone, apparently her psychoanalyst, who keeps changing identity.There are many shots of the stone circle at Stonehenge; of open country, apparently in West Germany, and cityscapes and street scenes of West Berlin, in washed-out color; views from train windows, and lingering shots of photographs and bric-a-brac on a shelf in an apartment.Over some of these scenes, voices are heard. A man talks about the Russian anarchist movement of the 1870's. A young woman, speaking too rapidly, expresses her banal opinions about life and politics in an inexpressive whine.""Journeys"" is the work of Yvonne Rainer, whose credentials as a maker of ""independent films,"" for which ""cinema obscura"" might be a better term, are impeccable. The Rockefeller Foundation and the New York State Council on the Arts are among the half-dozen organizations that provided funds for the film.However, it is doubtful that ""Journeys"" will engage the attention of anyone who is not a devoted member of the avant-garde film coterie. This reviewer, for one, came away with the impression of relentless, humorless self-indulgence that doesn't add up to very much.",1980-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'One and One' From Sweden:Scandinavian M. Hulot,"UNCLE DAN (Erland Josephson) is a well-to-do, middle-aged bachelor who's been called Uncle Dan since he was 5 years old. Uncle Dan has no need or desire to work. In seeming contentment, he stays in his room all day, in his nightshirt, unsuccessfully attempting to read ""Oblomov"" beyond page 22 and stuffing himself with pastries, which he keeps neatly lined up in a bureau drawer. ""I know I'm a parasite,"" he says cheerfully, ""but only a parasite on my poor dead parents."" When a relative asks him what he's doing these days, Uncle Dan answers, ""Grazing, grazing, like a good black sheep.""Ylva (Ingrid Thulin) is Uncle Dan's cousin, a cool, beautiful and unflappable woman, totally in charge of her life. Ylva and Uncle Dan grew up together with lots of other cousins, all of whom have gone on to marriage and families of their own. ""Well,"" says one of Uncle Dan's male cousins at a family get-to-gether, ""at least you're not queer."" ""No,"" Uncle Dan agrees, ""I'm not anything.""At the beginning of ""One and One,"" a 1977 Swedish film jointly directed by Mr. Josephson, Miss Thulin and Sven Nykvist, Ylva and her lover of many years are breaking up  at her insistence  and Ylva is taking it on herself to nudge Uncle Dan into what she calls maturity. Uncle Dan, though, is happy as he is.Ylva suggests they take a trip together. ""Nonsense,"" says Uncle Dan, popping a cream tart into his mouth, ""I don't even like you."" Ylva persists and finally, reluctantly, Uncle Dan sets off on a holiday in Denmark with Ylva. Among other things, she feels guilty for the terrible way she and the other cousins tormented the prim, proper and obedient Uncle Dan when he was a little boy.""One and One,"" which opens a limited engagement at the Performing Garage this evening, is a most peculiar but appealing movie. It's very much the kind of movie you'd expect to be made as a workshop enterprise by these three talented associates of Ingmar Bergman. By calling it a workshop enterprise, I don't mean that it looks unfinished or sloppy, only that it's composed of sometimes brilliant parts that don't make an especially brilliant whole.Though Mr. Josephson receives sole credit for the screenplay, I suspect that both Miss Thulin and Mr. Nykvist, who is also the film's cameraman, may have contributed to the film's dialogue and narrative as well as to its direction. What we see on the screen are two highly accomplished, intelligent actors working with their own material, which they study and refine in the course of the film's production.Uncle Dan and Ylva must have been great fun to create. He's a sort of brooding, Scandinavian M. Hulot who, in the course of the Danish holiday, emerges from the shadows of a wounded childhood to understand all that he's been missing as a man, and then to realize that it's too late for him to change.At the same time, Ylva, who undertook Uncle Dan's rehabilitation as therapy for herself, unexpectedly falls in love with him. It's a no-win situation for both.Though it sounds like a gloomy business, ""One and One"" is often funny. In these, its best moments, it has the air of something improvised, as in a long, rambling, comically self-conscious discussion among Uncle Dan, Ylva and a male friend about the joys of pornor-graphic films and how degrading they are for the poor people compelled to act in them.Uncle Dan really looks like M. Hulot as he goes hiking around a Danish beach resort wearing a crumpled hat, a sport shirt, which seems too small, and short pants, which seem too big and look decidedly odd with his black city shoes and short, black city socks.When Ylva is not reciting long, actressy monologues about such things as woman's identity and individualism, she's a warm, witty, fully realized character. Where Mr. Josephson and Miss Thulin have trouble is in convincing us that these two attractive, understanding, self-aware people could not work things out between them. The ending doesn't fit.The quality of the color print I saw at a screening was not great, but it was still apparent that the film has been elegantly, efficiently composed, with no superfluous visual flourishes. It unfolds in a series of swift, clean, simple scenes that often recall the unseen but always felt presence of Mr. Bergman. ""One and One"" is a fascinating footnote to the careers of three people who, while contributing so much to the work of the master, have learned a great deal from him.",1980-02-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Pacino Stars in Friedkin's 'Cruising':Another Country,"""IT'S a world unto itself,"" says a New York detective early in ""Cruising,"" William Friedkin's muddled melodrama about a particularly bizarre homosexual subculture in New York City. ""It's not the mainstream of gay life.""That's what the detective says but everywhere the movie goes, it sees nothing but young and not-so-young men who dress as if they were going to a costume ball in a garage for motorcyclists: leather jackets, leather vests, leather jeans, leather boots, leather caps, lots of superfluous chains, everything decorated with the studs that are sequins to members of the fancy s. and m. crowd.When Mr. Friedkin's camera passes through west Greenwich Village on a summer evening, it finds the streets and sidewalks teeming with men, seemingly hundreds of them, all of whom look exactly alike. When the movie goes uptown to seek out a late-night tryst, it finds more people milling around Central Park than you'd see in Times Square on New Year's Eve. According to ""Cruising,"" alien creatures have occupied New York, a city where it's always night for the living dead.Homosexual activist groups, which have been protesting the production of ""Cruising"" on the grounds that it would present a distorted view of homosexual life, were right. ""Cruising"" is a homosexual horror film. Even worse is that it's also a faint-hearted one, which is not to say that it's shy. It describes the s. and m. scene with far more leering attention to detail than most people will find necessary.These background images are rudely sensational and ugly, but they are far more plausible than the denatured narrative in the foreground. ""Cruising"" always seems to be doing its best to avoid admitting what it's about. Perhaps because of the complaints he received during production, Mr. Friedkin has ended up with a movie that's still in a closet.In adapting Gerald Walker's novel for the screen, the director-writer has made crude, sometimes totally confusing changes in the original. This was about a young policeman who goes undercover in search of a killer who's been preying on members of New York's s. and m. community. In the course of the assignment, the cop, finds himself changing, and not for the better. Assuming the identity and habits of a homosexual, he seeks the killer by identifying himself with the killer. Eventually he is the killer  which is the novel's twist.What happens to the film's cop, Steve Burns, is far from clear, though it's not especially ambiguous. The movie is only coherent if one knows Mr. Walker's narrative. In fact, I'm sure, the original story remains in the film, though it's held at such a distance I'd find that difficult to prove.In spite of the gaudiness of the locale, which has been well photographed by James Contner, ""Cruising"" is a very tepid personal drama. All of Mr. Pacino's best scenes seem to take place offscreen. There's one good moment in the film, when Steve Burns pleads with his boss, played by Paul Sorvino, to take him off the case. He can't take the life, he says desperately, and because he doesn't explain why, we suspect his fears have to do with more than his physical safety.Much of the time ""Cruising"" simply records the details of the cop's undercover activities  where he lives, how he makes friends, who these people are (professors, designers, actors, busboys, etc.) and, most important, what he sees when he hangs out at the leather bars.""Cruising,"" which opens today at the National and other theaters, is exceptionally unpleasant, not necessarily because of the subject matter, but because it makes no attempt to comprehend it. It just stares.The performances are not bad, but they aren't great either. Mr. Pacino, I suspect, knows what his character is up to even when Mr. Friedkin won't acknowledge it. Mr. Sorvino is once again Old Reliable in a movie that doesn't deserve him. Among the good supporting people are Karen Allen, as the girl Steve Burns leaves behind in the straight world, and Don Scardino, Jay Acovone, Arnaldo Santana and James Remar as some of the people the cop meets in the night. Richard Cox is effective as the cop's prime suspect, a psychotic Columbia music student.""Cruising"" is not really a murder-mystery. The killer is known early on. It's more on the order of a fictional travelogue, with an ending that is not a resolution of anything but a copout.",1980-02-15T05:00:00+0000

It is inhabited by only two people, Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett, and here is what they do: Jog. Grow houseplants. Shower together. Exercise a lot. Lounge around on padded pastel furniture, which would be lawn furniture if they had a lawn. And tell their one visitor, a menacing-looking Space Captain in black leather, ""We thought we'd have a welcoming drink first,"" this even before he can plunk down on a padded sofa and begin making trouble in paradise.The heavy of ""Saturn 3,"" a small and unattractive movie that opens at the roomy, handsome Ziegfeld theater today, is played by Harvey Keitel, who is ludicrously miscast but has the movie's funniest lines. (It is not supposed to be a comedy.) When Miss Fawcett calls attention to her cute little dog, Mr. Keitel pronounces the animal ""Just something to eat."" When she calls attention to herself, he says: ""You have a great body. May I use it?"" She says no. He becomes petulant. Trouble ensues. This is about as much of a plot as the movie ever develops.As directed by Stanley Donen, ""Saturn 3"" is horrendously gaudy, even though the cast includes a mere three principal players and the obligatory computer, with the fancy name ""Hector."" When Mr. Keitel's ship is launched for its visit to the way-station of the title, masked extras march solemnly down a runway as if they were contestants in a beauty pageant; behind them is a billboard reminiscent of the Columbia Pictures logo. Hector looks like a Visible Man model with a bad case of loosening of the arteries  and his appearance is not improved when he falls into the satellite's most dangerous region, a lagoon filled with deadly soapsuds. Saturn 3 itself looks like a set of mechanical entrails. And the action is so poorly staged that it's impossible to tell who is exactly where on the satellite. In a movie devoted almost entirely to chase scenes, this makes for considerable confusion.Mr. Douglas is perfectly affable. Miss Fawcett, as ever, is doe-eyed and delightful, and what she is doing in a movie this dim is anyone's guess. She deserves far better material than anything ""Saturn 3"" has to offer.Nine new films are being shown at the sixth annual Perspectives on French Cinema, which began yesterday at the Museum of Modern Art and will run Intermittently through Feb. 25.Today's attraction, at 2:30 P.M., is Herve Berard's ""Trs Insuffisant"" (""Very Unsatisfactory""), which is being shown without subtitles.Two films are scheduled tomorrow: Jean Eustache's ""Mes Petites Amoureuses"" at 2:30 P.M. and Pierre Kast's ""Le Solell en Face"" (""Facing the Sun"") at 5. Mr. Kast, one of several film makers scheduled to be present during the program, will introduce the picture.",1980-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Reminiscences Of Simone de Beauvoir:Documentary Portrait,"""SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR"" is more of a document than a documentary, because it devotes nearly two hours to the author's reminiscences, and never takes a keener attitude than one of admiration. Miss de Beauvoir, who was 70 years old when the film was made, two years ago, would have made a challenging interview subject at any point in her extensive career. But she has never seemed more formidable than she does now, when the power of her conviction has so evidently withstood the test of time.She is a relentless, overbearing speaker, and any film about her might have benefited from more interruption and illumination than Jose Dayan and Malka Ribowska, the co-directors, are able to provide. But at the beginning of the film, when an interviewer asks whether a film about her can amplify her writings, Miss de Beauvoir's response is affirmative, and the completed work does bear out her opinion. The film casts its share of new light as it reveals the exceptional tenacity of her conversation, the pugnacious intelligence with which she approaches any question, the extreme reluctance with which she yields the floor. Simone de Beauvoir brings her own brand of intensity to any subject, even the matter of why she and Jean-Paul Sartre served meat to Picasso and beans to Camus.Some of Miss de Beauvoir's reminiscences are relatively lighthearted, as she remembers which cafes she and Mr. Sartre, her companion for nearly 50 years, used to frequent, or the time she left Mr. Sartre for a brief hike in the woods and found him hard at work on ""Being and Nothingness"" by the time she returned. Mr. Sartre is one of several people who interview the author on camera, and his slow, gentle questions have a way of sounding clearer than her more extensive answers. A selection of still photographs shows the couple in their early days at the Sorbonne, as Miss de Beauvoir recalls their meeting in a voice-over. ""He really thought all day long,"" she says of the young Sartre. ""I thought a lot, but not all day.""A scene between the author and some of her former students shows an unexpected, easygoing side of her nature; she visibly enjoys one student's remarking that Miss de Beauvoir ""had a very abrupt and unpleasant way of asking questions."" Miss de Beauvoir is disarmingly unapologetic about this, as indeed she is unapologetic about every course she has pursued, every decision she has made. She is particularly affecting in speaking of why she does not regret not having had children, of her views on sexual fidelity and of her feelings about growing old.""Simone de Beauvoir"" will be shown tonight through Sunday, and next Thursday through March 2, at the Film Forum.",1980-02-21T05:00:00+0000

How can a director arouse such strong passions in her performers and still make her audiences drowsy? Pure exasperation seems to be the key. ""Blood Feud"" is Miss Wertmuller at her worst, which is just a hop, skip and a jump from her best, as far as I can see. Harsh words, perhaps, but then Miss Wertmuller makes hysterical movies. It's hard to respond generously to a harangue.""Blood Feud,"" which opens today at the Plaza, turns Sophia Loren into a harpy. That cannot have been easy. Otherwise, the film's accomplishments are muddled and minimal. Miss Loren plays a shrill Sicilian widow whose husband has been murdered by the town's richest man, soon to become the town's most influential Fascist (the story begins in 1920 and spans several years). Then she becomes involved with two other men, a socialist lawyer (Marcello Mastroianni) and a gangster who has gone to America and come back with a few phrases of English and a Victrola (Giancarlo Giannini). She winds up loving them both, but it takes quite a while for her to discover this, and meanwhile there is a lot of screaming.Miss Wertmuller, who fills the screen with messy camerawork and gorgeous scenery, presents three attitudes instead of three characters. This is by no means as simple as it sounds, because the attitudes aren't clearly rendered and they shift like the sands. But the gangster tends to be bad, although he is brave, which is useful. And the socialist tends to be good, although his helplessness doesn't help. The woman is clearly a heroine, because she defies the law to perform abortions. The men are terribly sexist about sex, which is a great big suprise for us all.""Blood Feud"" stays talky for a while, then builds to a number of action scenes that are staged almost comically, as if they were slapstick. The most remarkable thing in the film is a Greek temple in the Sicilian countryside, where sheep are seen grazing. The temple is also seen in a painting on someone's wall, and the sheep reappear periodically. So many characters turn up in black shirts by the story's doctrinaire ending that the sheep might well have been expected to saunter by in similar outfits. Fortunately, that doesn't happen.",1980-02-22T05:00:00+0000

Sitting on the jury is Claudia Cardinale, who also looks frightfully chic, but then one assumes she hasn't much to do except buy clothes because her husband, played by Vittorio Gassman, is a rich wheeler-dealer who is always too tired to make love to her.As the trial progresses, with many flashbacks to the tumultuous marriage of Monica and Giancarlo, Claudia realizes that she'd rather be married to a hot-blooded male chauvinist like Giancarlo than to the civilized, preoccupied Vittorio.The movie was directed by Marcello Fondato. It has the thinness of a very long revue sketch, peopled by characters without pasts and without futures. They are of so little substance, really, that they scarcely even qualify as stereotypes. The actors are photogenic and, without exception, tiresome. Adequate English subtitles translate the Italian dialogue, which has the peculiarly hollow sound of something badly dubbed.""The Immortal Bachelor,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some fleeting nudity and a few vulgar words, which, being in the subtitles, can only be understood by people who read.",1980-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Fog' Comes in at 3 Theaters:Revenge From the Past,"JUST 100 years ago, six leading citizens of the small Northern California community of Port Antonio did a nasty thing. Knowing that a group of rich lepers was planning to come to Port Antonio to set up a colony, the citizens moved the fog lights on shore so that the lepers' ship foundered on the rocks, allowing the Port Antiono people to steal the leper gold.This bit of intriguing exposition (I mean, have you ever before heard a ghost story about rich lepers?) opens John Carpenter's new film, ""The Fog."" The usually elegant actor, John Houseman, dressed up to look like a cross between Mack the Knife and Natty Bumppo, is telling the story to a circle of rapt children gathered around a campfire on the beach.""And when that fog reappears,"" the Storyteller (Mr. Houseman) goes on, ""the ghosts from that ship will rise from their watery graves to retrieve their gold and wreak a horrible vengeance,"" or words to that effect.Having given us a substantial start on a spooky, comfortably old-fashioned ghost story, Mr. Carpenter (""Halloween,"" ""Assault on Precinct 13""), appears to forget what kind of a movie he wants to make. ""The Fog,"" which opens today at Loew's State 1 and other theaters, is neither a rewarding ghost story nor is it science-fiction, though it borrows freely from both genres, to such an extent that air pollution or H-bomb testing might as easily be blamed for the film's mayhem as the leprous ghosts.Reduced to its particulars, ""The Fog"" is about what happens to the people of Port Antonio on the dreadful night when the fog does reappear and the late lepers do come ashore to take revenge.The fog that precedes the ghosts, however, seems to have a life and intelligence of its own, unconnected with the ghosts, and though the dead lepers would seem to have access to important supernatural powers, they are surprisingly slow on the uptake. Why, one wonders, didn't they come back before?Unlike ""Halloween,"" which was a model of straight-forward terror and carefully controlled suspense, ""The Fog"" is constructed of random diversions. There are too many story lines, which necessitate so much cross-cutting that no one sequence can ever build to a decent climax. The movie looks quite pretty but prettiness of this sort is beside the point in such a film.In addition to Mr. Houseman, who gets on and off the screen fast, the cast includes Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis (Miss Leigh's daughter who was the star of ""Halloween""), Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau (Mrs. Carpenter), Tommy Atkins, Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers. None of them disguises the fact that the material is thin.",1980-02-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Young and Rootless in 'Foxes':Some Teen-Agers,"""FOXES"" has a melting glamour that will some day smooth its way to the First Los Angeles Nouvelle Vague Film Festival, where it will perhaps turn up on a bill with ""California Split"" or ""American Gigolo"" or ""Welcome to L.A."" The characters are a little young for this genre, and a little tough. Nevertheless, in the movie's opening sequence they are seen sleeping like angels, prettily intertwined, four teen-age girls in a suburban bedroom bathed in early morning light.Whose room is this? Where are the girls' parents? What time does school start? The movie never becomes energetic enough to wonder. It simply follows four young actresses to concerts and parties and boulevards, to the beat of an incessant Donna Summer theme song. The actresses are quite appealing and a number of the film's teen tableaux have an impressive sense of style. But style isn't enough when questions of logic arise, which they do in ""Foxes"" with distracting regularity. The movie, which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is all texture, and the texture has plenty of holes.As a study of angry, rootless adolescents, ""Foxes"" bears a certain resemblance to such recent English films as ""Quadrophenia"" or ""That'll Be the Day."" It has more glitter than either of these, but less coherence: Adrian Lyne, the director of ""Foxes,"" was previously a director of commercials and he seems to have more flair for mounting scenes fashionably than for stringing them together. The screenplay, by the film's co-producer, Gerald Ayres, provides one dying-swan-on-drugs character to bind the story together, but there really isn't much of a thread. Only the actresses' high spirits hold the movie on track.Jodie Foster, whose performance is enough to makes ""Foxes"" worth seeing, plays the daughter of Sally Kellerman, whose performance is not. The fault is partly in the casting: Miss Kellerman, like Lois Smith and Randy Quaid who play the story's other adults, has a role that's virtually unmanageable. She's supposed to be a slatternly, negligent, faintly well-meaning mother who loses sight of her daughter for long periods of time, even though the girl and her three friends have taken over Miss Kellerman's household. Miss Foster is supposed to be adrift, although she is by far the strongest figure this story offers.Mother and daughter have two big scenes together. One is a fight that serves mostly to highlight the incompatibility of their acting styles: Miss Foster is stunningly direct, Miss Kellerman hopelessly stagey. The other scene is harder to describe. But it ends, after considerable rambling, with the two of them in bed, reading Plato.If ""Foxes"" were a better film, it would be able to make this scene's point more tidily, without invoking the Greeks. It would also be less full of surprises. Mr. Quaid, for instance, plays an older man, apparently an executive in the record business, who falls in love with one of the girls (Marilyn Kagan) and leaves her his house while he's out of town. We have seen very little of this couple before they come to a crisis; Miss Kagan and her friends give a party in the house and the house is ruined. When Mr. Quaid comes home, he and Miss Kagan have a brief fight, and she storms off childishly, refusing to apologize. That would seem to be the end of Mr. Quaid as far as the movie is concerned. But at the end of the film he reappears quite without warning. He and Miss Kagan are getting married.Miss Kagan, Miss Foster, Kandice Stroh and Cherie Currie (formerly of the Runaways, an all-girl rock band) give the film its spunk, and each of them emerges as a striking figure in the large-scale set pieces, the best parts of the film. At a rock concert, they strut and sass. At the supermarket, their principal acquisition is the boy at the checkout counter.The costumes and the soundtrack music contribute to the impression that ""Foxes"" is carefully detailed, terribly timely. Only in these departments, and in the performances of the principals, is ""Foxes"" really ahead of the game.",1980-02-29T05:00:00+0000
