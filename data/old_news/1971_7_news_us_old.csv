us,'Chocolate Factory',"The children have so few good films to claim as their own. Much as it pains us to say so, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is not one of them. Yes, it's clean. It's also tedious and stagy with little sparkle and precious little humor.The picture, which opened around town yesterday, cries out for animation, not live actors. Bright colorations and a mercurial animated flow could have done wonders to Roald Dahl's story of a little boy allowed to tour a magic chocolate factory, with his character tested by a nimble chocolate impresario.Most of the picture looks exactly like what it is, a fairly elaborate project shot by an American company inside a Bavarian studio. The three leads, Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and young Peter Ostrom, are quite appealing, unlike a pedestrian Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley score.Take the youngsters only if they're tired of ""Sesame Street,"" and why should they be?",1971-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Sweden's 'Language of Love',"Having been cleared officially, ""Language of Love,"" the Swedish-made color documentation of sex that was seized as obscene by Customs in October, 1969, turns out, unfortunately, to be somewhat of an anticlimax. Timing obviously is the villain here, for despite its quartet of sincere and frank experts and a variety of comely, unbilled volunteers, who expertly demonstrate the experts' observations, ""Language of Love"" adds nothing specially new to our movie scene, which, at this late date, already has been filled with practically every aspect of sex, educational, blue and in between.If this import is not particularly a pace-setter, it does leave the impression of trying to inform without leering. And, Dr. Sture Cullhed, a Swedish gynecologist; Dr. Maj-Brigt Bergstrom-Walan, a Swedish psychologist-educator, and Inge and Sten Hegeler, Danish psychologists-authors, who admittedly were inspired by Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, are sedately adult and direct in their approach to sexual anxieties and misconceptions, petting, masturbation, contraceptives, the organs and proper and improper practices.While the method of enlisting is not divulged, their obviously willing volunteers cooperate (via hidden cameras) with equal frankness and seeming sincerity. The uninitiate might be shocked by the varied, explicit nude sequences but an undisturbed adult viewer respecting the panel's intentions is still left wondering if the producers aren't interested in money more than they are in education.""The Language of Love,"" which arrived at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, the Agee Cine and the Kips Bay yesterday, is the English-language version that is reported to be shorter than the original, Swedish-language edition.

us,Film: 'What's the Matter With Helen?':Debbie Reynolds Stars With Shelley Winters Horror Movie Makes Fun of the 1930's,"""What's the Matter With Helen?"" belongs to that singular genre of screen horror literature that is almost as formal and unvarying in theme as that of Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales: Two women, beyond or just at middle age, abandoned by the men in their lives, find themselves isolated from the normally neurotic world and locked into a relationship of psychotic dependency.Helen (Shelley Winters) and Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) attain a certain notoriety in F.D.R.'s America when their two sons are convicted of an especially unwholesome murder (in the world of horror films, some murders must be less wholesome than others). Seeking anonymity, they move from the Middle West to Hollywood, where they set up a dance studio to train the sweet daughters of hideous mothers to tap-tap-tap their ways into careers as fourth-string Shirley Temples.The film, which opened yesterday at the Victoria and 86th Street East Theaters, spends quite as much time making sappy fun of the 1930's period  through things like Ovaltine ads and the self-conscious use of period slangas it does on its not terribly mysterious plot. The thing that's the matter with Helen is that she's a religious nut and definitely loony, which is obvious so early in the movie that ""What's the Matter With Helen?"" never has much place to go.Curtis Harrington (""Night Tide,"" ""Games"") tends to be a fancy director, but here, aside from some superfluous flashbacks that take the form of gruesome fantasies, he doesn't impose himself between his plot and his public. Miss Reynolds, looking like an ageless kewpie doll with platinum hair, and Miss Winters, wearing the expression of a reproachful pudding most of the time, apparently had a good deal of undisciplined fun making the film.If they seem to be following in the footsteps of Bette and Joan and Olivia and Geraldine and Ruth, it's because their screenplay was written by Henry Farrell, who also wrote ""Baby Jane"" and ""Sweet Charlotte,"" which inspired, in turn, ""Aunt Alice."" This new movie is so perfunctory, it's likely to give misogyny a bad name.",1971-07-01T05:00:00+0000

The bursting tanks, the frantic crew, the guttural cries of throats straining against the roar of the water rising higher and higherthere is perhaps no form of man's inhumanity to man quite so emotionally satisfying to the death lust of the normal moviegoer than the instant preparation of a watery grave for the predators to whom, until that second, submersion had meant safety.Some of the emotional satisfaction (though not exactly the situation) carries over into parts of Peter Yates's ""Murphy's War,"" which opened yesterday at the Music Hall, and which has Peter O'Toole as Murphy, the sole survivor of a World War II torpedo attack, using whatever means at his disposal to wreak single-handed vengeance on the German U-boat that sank his ship and then methodically gunned down the helpless crew.The means include a battered seaplane that Murphy does not know how to fly, an oil company's motor barge and crane and one-lung boat, and the very meager resources, of a medical mission located on the South American river that the submarine has made its secret port of refuge. Against Murphy are the pacifism of the mission's Quaker doctor (Sian Phillips), the lassitude of the oil company's man on the spot (Philippe Noiret), and time itselffor the war is ending, and with it will end the official rationale for revenge.The rationale for revenge takes a beating even before the war has ended, for ""Murphy's War"" pales over its decent adventure story with the sickly cast of second thoughts and some heavy irony about the senselessness of killing. Now, it so happens that most of the killing in the movie, though dreadfully brutal, makes perfect sense  for the U-boat, to maintain its secrecy; for Murphy, to pay them back. And when the movie, undercuts the impluses behind its action, as it does a little, the humanitarianism on the surface begins to look cheap and the savagery beneath to seem rather noble.The sense of a film in which nothing quite works with anything else pervades ""Murphy's War,"" and it extends from such crucial technical details as the sloppy and finally tedious cross-cutting between things (the seaplane, the motor barge, etc.) and the people who are supposed to be operating them, to the playing together of the principal actors.""Murphy's War"" is blessed with a very fine cast  that is quite simply never allowed the time or the involvement with one another to make an ensemble performance. This works especially against the excellent Peter O'Toole and Sian Phillips (who is in life the excellent Mrs. O'Toole), who treat each other with interesting complex respect when they get the chance but who rarely get the chance. Most of the time they are kept as far apart physically as ideologically, while she yells across a courtyard, a dock, a river, ""Mr. Murphy!,"" and he, never catching what she has to say, screams back in his best Irish brogue, ""Missus?""",1971-07-02T05:00:00+0000

In its length, its demands upon singers, its orchestral complexity and its sheer weight, it still poses all kinds of problems. In its new kind of chromatic, tonicavoiding har mony, it was an important (and per haps decisive) step in the dissolution of tonality. Its Schopenhauerian symbol ism is capable of all kinds or interpre tations; and while the libretto itself is wordy and static, the opera as a whole sweeps all before it. Tristan and Isolde is a mighty emotional experience. Books are still being written about it; singers are still worried by its demands; con ductors find it the greatest of all chal lenges; scene designers and directors approach it on tiptoe.",1971-07-04T05:00:00+0000

The method is scholarly scrubbing of in formation from hundreds of sources, with never a resort to hyperbole or frightwig. Though the word revolu tion appears infrequently and fascism only once, both are known to be in the wings. The center, Dut ton seems to say, will not hold, but it won't explode either if common sense is not altogether abandoned. There is tumult aplenty ahead, per haps even including a substantial withdrawal of consent. But on bal ance the prospect is for invigoration of the political body and a shedding of old skins for something more live ly and of more human coloration.Thus there are no revelations, no new actors here: Indochina, the ram paging young, crumbling cities and burgeoning suburbs, campaign costs, fumbling statesmen and inept par ties: Dutton almost never moves out side the standard currency of politi cal chatter.",1971-07-04T05:00:00+0000

us,A touch of nostalgia,"Nostalgia and romanticism may be news to the theater world, but to decorating, they are strictly old hat. Rooms rich with whimsey and houses that seem to have changed almost imperceptibly with each passing generation are the hall mark of one school of skilled decorators. Anything that appears too planned or matched or shines too brightly with newness is taboo in their romantic rooms. Instead, furnishings are softened and tempered with the patina of age (or its decorating equivalent). This small sitting room with walls of chrysanthemum yellow edged in white exemplifies the romantic spirit. Designer John Robert Moore 2d centered the Regency bull's eye mirror over the fireplace whose tiles are painted with trompe l'oeil animals. To its left, he placed an English lacquered writing table with a whimsical pagoda top. Botanical prints hang over it. On the right is a lacquered tea table with Chinese fretwork. Unmatched patterns vouch for the freedom of the romantic spirit seen here in the chintzcovered chair and its openarmed neigh bor, a gilt Adam chair covered in a silk sari print. The floors are covered in woven straw mats in stead of the tobeexpected heavy walltowall carpeting.",1971-07-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Adrift,' a Dream Anecdote:Work by Kadar Opens at the Rendezvous Life's Blessings Theme of Fisherman's Tale","The three movies of Jan Kadar that I have seen""The Shop on Main Street"" (1966), ""The Angel Levine"" (1970), and ""Adrift,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvousthough differing in story and details of situation, all share a distinctive technical vocabulary and a pervasive, perhaps obsessive, preoccupation with a theme.Actually, ""Adrift,"" which was begun in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and interrupted by the Russian occupation, mostly predates ""The Angel Levine,"" though it is a more assured and, in general, a more interesting movie.The Kadar theme concerns the failure to accept life's difficult blessings, and in each of the three films it is embodied in an anecdote having to do with a humble man who is strongly tempted to virtue but who, out of fear or skepticism or desire, resists the temptation and so loses the familiar giftin each case a womanthat he learns too late has given his life its value.In ""Adrift"" the hero (Rade Markovic) is a fisherman who rescues from the river a beautiful and utterly mysterious girl (Paula Pritchett). His interest in her, annoyance at first, grows until he can no longer make love to his wife (Milena Dravic) and when she takes sick and then miraculously almost recovers he prepares her medicine in a poisonous concentration  which he is about to give her when . . .""Adrift"" never quite ends; it circles. Its late sequences repeat its early sequences, and its central anecdote is told as a flashback in the course of an unreal inquisition that turns out to be a drunken dream. Dislocations between levels of reality are important to the movie, as its title suggests, and the deceptively simple, rather banal story is clearly intended to support a meaning structure that is at once demanding for its audience and, hopefully, magical in its associations.I must say that I think the magic at no time works, that the demands are purely gratuitous, that the simplicities of the story are every bit as real as they are apparent, and that its banality is only enforced by the devices  the shock cutting, the symbolic clues, the musical mottos, including the choir of heavenly voices that seems to travel from one Kadar movie to anotherby which the director intends to impress significance upon material from which he has been unable or unwilling to extract meaning on its own terms.Nevertheless, ""Adrift"" is serious work by a director who knows what he wants to do and commands the resources and the skill to do it. I continue to find Kadar a dull artist, but in the context of his particular kind of semimystical cinema he provides at least the example of a genuine intellectual ambition at work.In the previous Kadar movies I have seen, the prize neglected was played by Ida Kaminska, an actress with qualities calculated to bring out the worst in her director. The very lovely and talented Miss Dravic is in every way an improvement, except that stuck in bed and made feverish, she begins to seem, in Jan Kadar's hands, a little like Ida Kaminska. An American, Paula Pritchett, plays the girl in the river. Between the classic angularity of her face and the magnificent nonangularity of her body she combines the best of two erotic-fantasy worlds. But she does not, if you happen to notice, offer much of a performance.",1971-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Cross-Country Ride and a Chase in Spain,"In the hearts of many Americans, I suspect, faith in God is a lot less important, less immediate and even less mystical than faith in the internal combustion engine. It's no wonder. The internal combustion engine, especially when it is placed in an automobile, is something that can be touched, tinkered with, modified, souped up and, when necessary, dismantled, as well as worshiped as the means by which a man makes his way through life.When your destination is without meaning, your style must be expressed through transportation, according to the wisdom of the contemporaries. Thus, nothing becomes modern man as much as the wheels in which he makes his arrivals and departures.In Monte Hellman's new film, ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, the godhead is the crankcase of a 454-cubic-inch, high-performance '55 Chevy with aluminum heads, the car through which two young men, identified only as The Driver (James Taylor) and The Mechanic (Dennis Wilson), realize their destinies in a series of drag races in Esso country, across blacktop space and through stop-watch time.If my description so far sounds heavily metaphoric, it's because ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" looks very much like the sort of movie that was conceived as a metaphor and, only after some difficult labor pains, given form as a literal narrative. Ordinarily, it's the sort of movie I find easy to resist; since I prefer metaphors that, like friends, reveal themselves in the natural order of events, without proclamations.""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" however, is a remarkably engaging movie, mostly in spite of, rather than because of, its metaphorical aspirations. All of which was most surprising to me after having plowed through the screenplay, by Rudolph Wurlitzer and Will Corry, which Esquire published last April and, with a certain reckless optimism, described as its ""nomination for the movie of the year,"" even though there were still eight months to go.Monte Hellman, its 40-year-old director, has for some years enjoyed an underground reputation as the man who made not only ""Beast from Haunted Cave,"" for Roger Corman's atelier, but also two low-budget Westerns, ""The Shooting'' and ""Ride the Whirlwind,"" which received few, if any, theatrical dates in this country and yet were acclaimed in France as two of the most exciting, most objective, most nihilistic American films in years.On the basis of ""The Shooting,"" which I once saw on television,"" and ""Two-Lane Blacktop,"" it seems to me that Hellman's reputation may well be deserved, but for reasons that have not so much to do with his apparent fondness for elliptical, draw-your-own-conclusion narratives as for his humor, his appreciation of action as the caw material of film narrative and for a fine discipline of technique. All of these have helped to transform a sometimes pretentious screenplay into a real movie.Most of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" has to do with a cross-country race, from New Mexico to Washington, D.C., undertaken by The Driver and The Mechanic, accompanied by a teen-age hitchhiker, The Girl (Laurie Bird), in the back seat, with a fancy, 1970 Pontiac G.T.O., driven by a dapper, 30ish psycho known only as G.T.O. (Warren Oates). Each one of the characters is obviously damned, in one way or another, in his passage through the American landscape. The Driver and The Mechanic can relate, ultimately, only to their car; G.T.O. to the fantasies of what he once was (a TV producer, a dutiful son, a test pilot, or all or none of these things), and The Girl only to momentary fulfillment with whomever she happens to be.The movie, however, deals in specific encounters, in individual races, in meetings in roadside hamburger stands and tanktown bars, most of which vividly catch the tempo and rhythm of American life in much the same way that good rock does, even when the actual lyrics are fruity, or unintelligible.Perhaps because his role is the only one that suggests a past, Oates is the most interesting person in the film, a driving, driven middle-aged man, his handsome face beginning to collapse, who keeps talking about the need to settle down if he isn't to go into orbit, though he clearly already is in orbit and out of control. James Taylor, the recording star, and Dennis Wilson (of the Beach Boys) may or may not be actors, but they have the proper cool for contemporary mythic characters, and they look so much alike that I can't believe it's an accident. They are the two faces of the same man. Miss Bird's Girl, looking like a young, vulnerable Mimsy Farmer, is a lost seed that somehow grew.""Two-Lane Blacktop"" is a far from perfect film (those metaphors keep blocking the road), but it has been directed, acted, photographed and scored (underscored, happily) with the restraint and control of an aware, mature filmmaker.",1971-07-08T05:00:00+0000

Lacking them, and having instead George C. Scott, Tony Musante, Trish Van Devere, and Colleen Dewhurst, it stumbles along with determination, I guess, but some deathless lines and very possible situations are wastefully thrown away.""You were veryardent,"" says a soulful, heavily Latinate Miss Dewhurst, the local prostitute of a little Mediterranean fishing village, to Mr. Scott, an American expatriate and her current customer. Though I suspect the begining of some kind of family joke, Mr. Scott comes back with nothing worth repeating. But you can imagine a Rufus T. Firefly given that line for openers.And later, when he is explaining the sadness of his life to Miss Van Devere  the moll of the gunman he is helping to escape the police and everyone else  and she asks where his wife is, Scott answers, ""I don't know. Right after our son died she went to Switzerland to have her breasts lifted. I thought she meant by surgery. She never came back.""With only the slightest change in delivery it might have been Otis B. Driftwood playing for sympathy in the mighty heart of Mrs. Clay-pool, but George C. Scott plays for nothing except for Richard Fleischer, whose comic gift has never run wild and who here is striving for a kind of Hemingwayesque elemental truth amid the sun-drenched walls and deep interior shadows of an endlessly picturesque Spain.Facing that truth is one Harry Garmes, ex-get-away-man who comes out of retirement to drive a hood to safety  that turns out to be a trap from which the real escape must be made. Harry has been nine years away from the business, and he mostly wants to test himself (much talk about alternate ways of dying), but the hood calls him ""uncle"" and the hood's girl sometimes acts like his niece, and the test proves a little inconclusivethough I'd say he passes.Despite the profundities of the dialogue, ""The Last Run"" is a decent enough project that has been rendered ludicrous in its intimacies and dull in its excitements more by directorial misjudgment than by any necessity in the screenplay. Fleischer, a veteran of more than 20 years in the business (""Dr. Dolittle,"" ""Tora! Tora! Tora!,"" etc.) seems not yet to have mastered the reaction shot; and his automobile chase sequences, for all the billowing dust and squealing tires, seem to move at 30 miles an hour.I happen to admire all the cast, but from other movies.

us,Movies by Bayer and Rivette Begin Runs:Stage Troupe Tours in 'Mississippi Summer',"Meaning in movie titles goes as much by fashion as does anything else, and though most are merely inexpressive, those that aren't tend to carry connotations as much suggestive of their times as of themselves. Thus, in better and more innocent days, somebody about to see ""Christmas in Connecticut"" or ""Home in Indiana"" might at least have known what kind of film to expect. But I'd lay odds that almost anyone chancing on William Bayer's ""Mississippi Summer"" will assume a documentary on race relations. That would be wrong. It is a fiction film about race relations. And race relations all year long; there is a Christmas Party right in the middle of ""Mississippi Summer.""It concerns a troupe of actors, half black, half white, who in 1964 travel through Mississippi performing a voter-registration propaganda play in churches and barns before black rural audiences. At first, their leader, Michael, speaks noble words to them and they respond nobly. But gradually their audiences fall off and nobody wants to register anyway and the company begins to split, black and whiteuntil they part, the whites driving their car down one fork in the road, the blacks driving their bus down the other fork in the road, with Michael deposited in front of a stop sign at the intersection, without visible means of transportation.Symbolism at just this level typifies ""Mississippi Summer,"" which also fails in dialogue, direction, editing and acting. I have heard lines delivered more feelingly in Army training films, where, indeed, I have also heard better lines. I believe it is the custom in treating films of this nature not to question anyone's sincerity and generously to allow for everyone's ineptitude. But Mr. Bayer's performances seem to have come out of first year drama school, and his ideas, out of a Waring blender, and if his exploration of a tragedy of our times is to be taken for real, then he succeeds only in giving sincerity a bad name.""Mississippi Summer"" was made with the help of a grant from the American Film Institute.",1971-07-09T05:00:00+0000

Wallace smilingly transformed a Sen ate hearing here today into campaign platform for 1972. Although the Alabama Gov ernor had been asked to testify on the problems of rural development, he chose instead to restate his 1968 Presidential campaign themes and offer a broad hint, as he has before, that he will be candidate again next year. Senator Humphrey, the Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the subcommit tee holding the hearings, watched and listened from across a gleaming walnut table in the Alabama House of Representatives as Gover nor Wallace criticized the Su preme Court, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, busing, bureaucrats and superrich foundations. As the Governor ended his testimony he told Senator Humphrey that they might see each other again in 1972. Mr. Humphrey, who was the Democratic Presi dential candidate in 1968, smiled fleetingly. Of course, Governor, you meant that would be a strictly social oc casion, he said. The hearing today was part of a field trip by Senator Humphrey's Sub committee, the Agricultural Subcommittee on Rural De velopment. Another hearing is scheduled tomorrow in Georgia. Previously, the subcommittee had traveled to Iowa and South Dakota for similar meetings with state officials. But neither of those hearings attracted the attention focused on the en counter today between the two losers in the Presidential elec tion of 1968. The historic chambers of the Alabama House of Representatives, where in 1861 the state seceded from the Union, were jammed with partisan supporters of Governor Wallace and throngs of the curious.",1971-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,' Nun' Adapted From 'La Religieuse',"""The Nun,"" Jacques Rivette's film adaptation of Diderot's ""La Religieuse"" (published in English as ""The Memoirs of a Nun""), is a beautiful, calm, austere movie that somehow manages to be remarkably faithful to the original, yet quite different in tone. Here is a most curious example of the adaptation of a classic being more somber than the text from which it was adapted. Because we always like to think of ourselves as more sophisticated now than we were six weeks ago (to say nothing of 200 years ago), it usually works the other way around.Diderot's ""La Religieuse,"" written in 1760 but not published until 1796, had its origins as an elaborate and rather cruel practical joke, as a series of letters written by Diderot to his friend, the Marquis de Croismare, who had earlier assisted a certain Sister Suzanne Simonin in her unsuccessful suit to have her vows revoked. Attempting to lure his friend back to Paris from his country estate, Diderot, in the letters, represented himself as Sister Suzanne, newly escaped from her convent and in need of the marquis's aid.In addition to the letters, Diderot also composed a journal, supposedly kept by Sister Suzanne, in which she recounted how she had been forced into the nunnery by her family, had been coerced into taking her vows, had been tortured when she resisted the hair shirts and the whips, and had memorized the order's constitution to become, in effect, a nunnery lawyer.Things went no better for Sister Suzanne when she was finally transferred to another convent, which was run by a mad mother superior, a pretty, pudgy-faced lesbian, and where the sisters drank liqueurs, munched sweets and shrieked up and down the cloistered corridors, blowing kisses to one another. With the help of an erring monk, Sister Suzanne leaped over the wall one night to meet a death more precipitous than fate might reasonably have been expected to impose, principally because Diderot realized that the Marquis de Croismare had taken the joke seriously and was preparing to come to the sister's rescue.""La Religieuse"" was not as much an expos of convent lifethough it came to be known as thatas it was a romantic polemic on tyranny, written in the extravagant terms that its author knew would most fascinate and upset the good marquis. Even today it is quite out-rageous, as when, for example, Sister Suzanne and the crazy mother superior stage what amounts to a slapstick battle over Sister Suzanne's virtue, so amazingly well preserved that Samuel Richardson's Pamela would have been proud to call it her own.There is, however, behind all of the extravagances of ""La Religieuse"" the straightforward progression of tragedy, and it's this progression, this movement towards an inexorable fate, that Rivette's film details with almost classic simplicity. ""The Nun"" is theatrical, without in any way being uncinematic, beginning as if it were a ritual, or a play, the stage of which is the chapel where Sister Suzanne (Anna Karina) makes her first dramatic refusal to take the vows, and then is led away, crying, by the older, completely implacable brides of Christ. There are hardly any exterior shots in the film, but even the few exteriors have the sealed, exitless feeling of the convent interiors.Miss Karina's beauty, for which Godard once made movies that were also homages, is the perfect centerpiece for a film that looks cool and graceful but is passionately determined with the heart of a revolutionary. It's a lovely performance, one that never condescends to play on pathos but grows in strength with each new outrage so that the final, very wild moments of the film have the kind of conviction that transforms melodrama into something a good deal more important.The cast also includes Liselotte Pulver, Micheline Presle and Francine Berge, as mother superiors of varying degrees of correctness; Christine Lernier, as Sister Suzanne's real mother, who dismisses her daughter with the cheery reminder that ""my fate in the hereafter depends on you,"" and Francisco Rabal, as the monk who, with love, successfully dooms Sister Suzanne.Rivette and Jean Gruault (who also wrote Godard's ""Les Carabiniers"" and Truffaut's ""The Wild Child""), did the excellent adaptation, which, not so incidentally, has taken a long time to get here. The film, which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, was made in 1965, banned for a while by the French Government for reasons that were patently absurd, and then shown twice at the 1968 New York Film Festival. It's with pleasure I report its arrival.",1971-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,The New Play,"TIMON OF ATHENS, the New York Shakespeare Festi val's production of Shake speare's play in Central. Park, got unfavorable re views from the four critics who covered it. Clive Barnes: An institution like the New York Shakespeare Festival has a responsibil ity to stage the lesser known plays of Shake speare as well as the more celebrated major works. Unfortunately, when a play by Shakespeare is lesser known there is usually a very good reason for it. Timon of Athens is one of Shakespeare's mature trag edies and it has some most beautiful poetry in it. Yet the flat simplicity of the play's structure and its lack of any true develop ment does make it a little tedious. Also, in that worthy but foolish Athe nian, Timon, we have the dullest and least convinc ing of all Shakespearean heroes. For all this it is understandable why  once in every decade or so Timon has to be staged but it also has to be staged better than this. Gerald Freedman's direc tion seemed oddly flaccid. He is not much helped by the company. The verse speaking was the worst I have heard in Central Park for some seasons. For Walter Kerr see Page 1.",1971-07-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Bergman's 'Touch' Tells a Love Story,"Ingmar Bergman describes ""The Touch"" as his first love story, which just goes to prove that a director, even one of the best, may often be a most unreliable source of information about his own work. If they aren't love stories, whatin the name of God (who, in Bergman's world, is synonymous with enigmatic love)are ""Shame"" and ""The Passion of Anna?"" What is ""The Hour of the Wolf""? In each of these films, Bergman deals with aspects of lovewith the cruelties of love, with the terrible absences of love, and with the processes by which love, in its own time, can die.""The Touch,"" Bergman's first film to be shot in English, is certainly not his first love story, though it comes close to being the first outright soap opera that I can remember him making.Because ""The Touch"" is by Bergman, you may be sure that it's quite unlike any other soap opera you've ever seen, but it shares with that sometimes fascinating serial form a passion for detailing the gloomy side effects of passion, while communicating hardly any sense of the exaltation. Like ""The Secret Storm,"" it stands around talking its head off, in language that is neither rich, nor strong, nor funny, nor poetic enough to do real justice to its emotions.Unlike ""The Secret Storm,"" however, ""The Touch"" does have a beginning, a middle and an irrevocable end. It's the story of a rootless, neurotic, German-born American archeologist (Elliott Gould), on a dig in Sweden, a placid Swedish doctor (Max von Sydow), and the doctor's wife (Bibi Andersson) whom the archeologist, with the touch of love, brings to life, which may, in fact, be her destruction.At one point during their affair, the archeologist takes his mistress to the medieval church where he is working and shows her an ancient wooden madonna that has been walled up for something like 500 years. In the course of excavation, he tells her, larvae, of an insect long since extinct, have been reawakened and now are in process of destroying the madonna from the insidewhich is more or less the capsulated story of the middle-class wife.The trouble with ""The Touch"" is not in the situation, or in the ideas, but in the language. The English dialogue that Bergman has given his stars sounds like those early, grammatically perfect, and lifeless translations of Ibsen that Eva La Gallienne used to pump around the American stage. ""Go, now, Andreas,"" Gould says to von Sydow in a crucial confrontation between the lover and the husband. ''You've humiliated both of us long enough with this ridiculous visit of yours!""The banality of the language has no visibly ill effect on the performances of Miss Andersson and von Sydow, who, when they are speaking English, must sound a little bit strange and self-conscious. It is, however, fatal to Gould, who doesn't help matters by giving his lines those slightly flat readings that were so funny in ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,"" but, in ""The Touch,"" suggest that the actor is in a different dimension of drama from those of his costars.It's an extremely complex role that Bergman has written for Gould, that of a man who is haunted by the fact that he is his family's only male survivor (his father died in a concentration camp), and who is apparently his sister's protector and lover. But little of this complexity comes through and I, for one, never believed that his archeologist could find a cuff-link in a messy bureau drawer, much less an ancient shard on a hillside.Von Sydow has one of those roles, which, by definition, is impossible to respond tothat of the cuckolded husband  but Miss Andersson is as charming and affecting as a movie that is not dealing in charm and affection allows her to be.Bergman may occasionally make dull moviesas I believe ""The Touch"" to bebut he cannot be stupid, and ""The Touch"" is full of what might be called the innuendos of his genius. The opening sequence, where Miss Andersson visits the hospital room in which her mother has just died, is as lovely an evocation of loss as Bergman has ever done. There are fragments of love scenes, between the wife and her husband, and between the wife and her lover, that are so simple and personal you forget you are in detergent drama.Although it is often oblique, the drama is without mystery, and sometimes ridiculously blunt, as when Miss Andersson visits Gould for their first successful assignation and we hear, offscreen, the sound of a buzz saw. This is what some critics mean, I guess, when they say that the film is accessible.""The Touch"" opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater.",1971-07-15T05:00:00+0000

Their language, denoting an almost methodical drug addiction and most of it delivered in a paranoid whine or mumble, is filthy. The point, quite literally, is an interminable, almost loving focus on needle injections.The sound-track spice is an intrusion of caterwauled rock 'n' roll. The low-keyed color photography by a Hollywood ace, William Fraker, is excellent. Such is the modest production, written and directed by Floyd Mutrux, which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater, with a cast primarily of actual dope addicts ""doing their own thing."" One viewer frankly wishes they had done it privately.Young Mr. Mutrux had a sound enough idea in recruiting a cast of nonprofessionals, letting them speak spontaneously and looping the vignettes together with a final, melodramatic flourish to underscore their plight.The horror is here to see, explicitly detailed. But the droning and the people, both, are repetitious, dirty and, worse, dull. It becomes stultifying. To listen is to learn, at least about this bunch.One dolorous youth labels himself a homosexual hustler, a seducer of young boys, who might not be ""if the country were all it should be, ya know?"" No. An older junkie babbles with a kind of jovial pride, standing before his alma mater, the Los Angeles jail. A runny-nosed girl peddler tells us that she's really ""afraid of the junkies, ya know.""""Ya know I'll be comin' home,"" yodels a sound-track singer in a sickening scene, as a baby-faced couple in their mid-teens prepare an injection that kills the boy.

us,Light at the Edge of the World',"""The Light at the Edge of the World,"" which was switched on in various colors at local theaters yesterday, casts a weak light and considerable heat on a clutch of abnormal principals, who, it eventually turns out, didn't really deserve all that attention. As a period adventure culled from Jules Verne about a harried lighthouse keeper and a bloodthirsty band of ship wreckers out to destroy him, it is short on full explanations and long on aimless sound and fury.Program notes indicate that it takes place in 1865 on a craggy point at Cape Horn. Kirk Douglas, as a bearded, disenchanted, expatriate American with a vaguely spotted past, is the only witness to the murder, by invading wrecker-pirates, of Fernando Rey, the chief lighthouse man, and Massimo Ranieri, his other assistant. So, Yul Brynner, the vicious but sybaritic captain of the marauders, keeps chasing the tortured hero, whose will to survive such ersatz and gory circumstances is admirable.""Every ship that passes must pay tribute to me."" Brynner declares imperiously at one point. He seems to have done well, what with such spoils as an Arab stallion he uses to pursue Douglas; Samantha Eggar, whom he's plucked off a wrecked packet; a fur-lined kaftan I wears like a Mongol chief tain; paintings, silverwar and fine wines captured by wild, motley crew almost weird as their glowering captain.Kevin Billington, a comparative newcomer from Britain, unfortunately generate little excitement in direction these lurid goings-on in Spain Perhaps, like this viewer, was affected by Douglas who, long before he did patches Brynner in a field climax, says prophetical.

Jung was establishing a close relation ship between the spirit of mankind and the spirit of the earth, suggesting that the earth has a soul of its own. The visionary Swedenborg made similar suggestions. He wrote that the heavens took the form of a man's body. I be lieve that the earth is also divided into parts, like the body of a man. It has a head, a brain, a solar plexis, a heart, and sexual organs. Since these are all different, it follows that the people living in various parts of the world are not the same.

It's a see-through movie composed of a lot of clanking, silly, melodramatic effects that, like rib-tickling, exhaust you without providing particular pleasure, to say nothing of enlightenment.""The Devils,"" in fact, is of so little substance, obscene or otherwise, that I can only believe that the men and women of the Motion Picture Association, who rated the film ""X,"" must be in league with Beelzebub, or with Warner Brothers, the selfdescribed ""Kinney leisure company"" that financed the film. It just may be that there's still enough mystery in an X rating to make ""The Devils"" more popular than it has any right to be.In 1634, in Loudun, France, Father Urban Grandier, a handsome, sophisticated lay priest, who had been educated by the Jesuits, was convicted of witchcraft, largely on the hysterical testimony of a small group of Ursuline nuns, and burned at the stake, with the approval of Cardinal Richelieu, whose belief in witches was not noticeably great.Father Grandier was guilty of a number of cardinal outrages (among other things, he had married himself to Loudun's most virtuous heiress in front of his own altar), but his execution, as Huxley carefully detailed, was a badly disguised political act. It was a small, tragic skirmish in Richelieu's much larger campaign to reduce the power of the feudal towns, thereby to assure the absolute authority of the King, Louis XIII, and, through the King, the absolute authority of Richelieu.Although I rather liked Russell's adaptation of ""Women in Love,"" I was appalled by ""The Music Lovers,"" and thus I can't explain why I should have been surprised to find his approach to ""The Devils"" to be that of a hobbyist determined to reproduce ""The Last Supper"" in bottle tops. Russell, as writer and director, has simplified and reduced the complexity of the drama to the dimensions of that most boring kind of Pop art, which tries to forestall criticism by making fun of itself.How else to explain a sequence in which Richelieu attempts to lecture the King on the historical necessities of power, while the King busies himself taking pot snots at Huguenots who run across his lawn dressed in bird costumes? ""Bye, bye, blackbird,"" says the king as one uncredited extra explodes in a puff of feathers. It's not the fantasy that is objectionable, but the quality of the imagination behind it.A movie that opens with Louis XIII dressed as Botticelli's Venus, emerging from a half shell in a court tableau (to throw Tiny Tim kisses to his audience), is obviously a movie less interested in coherent thought than in spectacle. This includes crucifixion fantasies, in which Sister Jeanne of the Angels, Grandier's chief accuser, sees herself licking the blood off Christ's (Grandier's) hands, exorcism by enema, tortures, vomiting, and the final immolation.""The Devils"" is so concerned with the ""look"" of these experiences that it ultimately diminishes their meaning, and, in turn, the meaning of the lives of the people who lived them.In view of this, I suppose it's no special wonder that most of the performers behave like figures in an animated wax-works. When the screenplay allows, Oliver Reed suggests some recognizable humanity as poor Father Grandier, but everyone else is ridiculous. Vanessa Redgrave, who can be, I think, a fine actress, plays Sister Jeanne with a plastic hump, a Hansel-and-Gretel giggle, and so much sibilance that when she says ""Satan is ever ready to seduce us with sensual delights,"" you might think that Groucho Marx had let the air out of her tires.",1971-07-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Love of Rancher's Wife Is Spark for 'The Hunting Party,' a Western","I think it is proper to praise Candice Bergen, who has risen from the ephemeral celebrity stardom in which she began her career to the level of durable professionalism that characterizes her work today. ""Durability"" may not seem quite the notion for a beautiful young woman, but in Miss Bergen's performances it is as much an intelligent, sympathetic alertness  in a sense, a moral qualityas any gift of nature that accounts for her extraordinary appeal. And that appeal holds good not only for a showcase role in a movie like ""Carnal Knowledge"" but also for an utterly thankless role in a really stupid movie like ""The Hunting Party,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and 86th Street East theaters.Miss Bergen plays the wife of a rich Texas rancher (Gene Hackman), who is also an impotent sadist. One day she is kidnapped by a hard-riding outlaw (Oliver Reed) because he mistakes her for a school teacher and, anxious to improve his lot, means to make her teach him to read and write. They never get beyond the alphabet, but, what with one thing and another, they do fall in loveso that when the rancher gives chase, supported by a hunting party of business associates carrying high-powered rifles equipped with telescopic sights, it becomes something like the flight of passionate innocence from a methodical and psychotic rage.One by one the hunting party cuts down the outlaw's band (much colorful blood and gore) and at the same time loses its own members until there remains only Gene Hackman pursuing across the burning desert a lurching Oliver Reed leading Miss Bergen, who, by now somewhat dotty from the sun, has begun babbling of green fields.To the unwary, ""The Hunting Party"" might seem an all-out bid for family entertainment, combining as it does sex and violence with primary education. But in fact it neither teaches nor titillatesexcept as movies of this sort tend to get funnier as they become more stark, more elemental, more deadeningly expressive of elemental values in ultimate confrontation. To this end, Don Medford, the director, hokes up the action to a degree not required by the story and, with a stunning tactlessness, catches scene after scene at its dramatic limit and pushes it over into helpless banality.Given a less than perfect environment for actors, Gene Hackman actually improves upon his situation by looking as if he not only wished he could be, but actually were, someplace else. Oliver Reed, who is also not indigenous to the Old West, gives his role his allwhich is considerably more than it can take. Whether making love or dealing death or dying, he acts with a kind of drawn-out intensity that suggests nothing so much as grand opera in close-up. But Miss Bergen, mostly without tricks and without reservations, plainly succeeds with a part that is not so much a character as a test of character. Every so often, and only because it observes her, ""The Hunting Party"" seems to reveal something of human nature.",1971-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Julia Homburg, leading lady of the Burgtheater, has married her lover, George Kerenyi, an antiHitler journalist, after the death of her Jewish husband. Their attempt to regain a civilian equilibrium is jolted by the sudden reappearance of General Tenius, an SS veteran with blackmail on his mind. Why the Kerenyis and their friends have reason to fear Tenius, Miss Gainham tells us in her own sweet time, reweaving along the way the texture of the era. The distinguishing feature of these views of the AustroGerman side of the War is their subtlety. No crude stereotypes are to be found in this, postwar vortex.

Partly it's because the company crossed the sea, more for glory than for conquest, armed with audacity and derringdo. Also, Cranko himself is a kind of cross between Francis Drake and Henry Morgan, his revolutionary, lawless ballets fly the Jolly Roger, and his dancers disport themselves like swashbuckling buccaneers. Surprise is their weapon. Who ever heard of a German ballet company, much less one from Stuttgart? That's a large provincial town which combines the liveliness of Des Moines with the beauty of downtown Detroit. They make beer and MercedesBenz in Stuttgart.

Cape Goliard of London, publishers of the most magnificent books of poetry in English today, have given us in Archaeologist of Morning all the poems Olson published in his lifetime, apart from the Maximus sequence. The earliest of the poems (1946) are culled from established magazines like Harper's and Atlantic, the later ones from subterranean publications such as Matter and Magazine of Further Studies. Undoubtedly many poems exist in manuscript that have yet to appear, so this collection is incomplete against the larger effort of his lifetime; nonetheless, we are grateful for it. It is a beautiful and impressive tribute to Olson, a year after his death 59.To view the collected poems as this volume forces us to do is to get a confused sense of subjectThere are poems, that weave classical images through contemporary instances; that create Piero di Cosimo effects, luxurious yet deft. Poems that burst upon the tide of an established myth and seem to vivify it, as the beautiful ode to Aphrodite, The Ring Of. Poems written in the heat of Olson's dig among the Maya, unfolding his theories of body (and eye), against his enmity for modem civilization, and its usury of spirit. Poems that try to place everything in a happy parataxis of Sumerian drift, that root out beginnings to beginnings, prelogic, preliminary.

us,"Screen: 'Figures in a Landscape' Bows:Losey Work Appears at Festival Theater Robert Shaw, Malcolm McDowell Are Stars","Joseph Losey's ""Figures in a Landscape"" is a movie that intends to say more by going to rather great pains to reveal less.Mac (Robert Shaw), a rough, stupid, instinctive man, a sort of English hardhat, and Ansell (Malcolm McDowell), who is self-aware, sensitive and young enough to be Mac's son, are fugitives from an unidentified war, being pursued through a magnificently photogenic, unidentified landscape by an unidentified enemy, represented for most of the film, by a single helicopter, piloted by a man whose eyes are always goggled.Sometimes the helicopter just hangs over Mac and Ansell, as if waiting for them to kneel or to make some other gesture of supplication. At other times it comes down out of the sun to track them through an orchard, or to pin them to a hillside as it swoops and soars like a hawk preparing for a kill.Mac and Ansell, you realize very early in the film, are the complementary halves of a kind of contemporary Everyman, as much at war with each other as with their implacable pursuer, each absolutely dependent on the other, and, eventually, each as full of love for the other, as full of hate. That sort of realization has a tendency to make my heart sink, since it means that one is not going to be allowed to attend to the simple pleasures of vicarious adventure without also being forced to consider the film's aspirations as a metaphor.What Lossy and Robert Shaw (who, in addition to starring in the film, also adapted Barry England's novel) have attempted to do is to upgrade a genre movie by giving it an intellect. (You might also say they've attempted to downgrade a genre moviebut that depends on your point of view.) The result is decidedly mixed. The adventures are often stunningly realized, though they don't necessarily build in suspense, but run horizontally, as if filling in the time until the final, climactic confrontation, which, incidentally, says no more about Mac and Ansell than have any number of earlier sequences.""Figures in a Landscape"" is Losey's first film since his two-picture sabbatical as director-in-residence for the Richard Burtons (""Boom,"" ""Secret Ceremony""), during which time it seemed as if his work was evolving into that of a stylish but gloomy interior decorator. With this film, it is apparent that Losey is back in charge of his own career, which is to say he is conceding nothing to the demands of big stars and big properties. He is, instead, pursuing his own metaphysical concerns, which, as in two of his best recent films, ""The Servant"" and ""Accident,"" are so ambitious that one can admire the concerns even without responding to them.In this case, Losey's directorial talents are evident, though they never transform the Shaw screenplay with its Pinteresque dialogue, into an especially moving or meaningful experience. ""No bloody order! No bloody discipline!,"" Mac rants at the young Ansell, as if they were a father and son in a London suburb and not fighting for their lives in an alien land. They argue about marriage but never mention where they are going.""Why marry?,"" asks Ansell. ""With the pill you can have anyone you likemodels, wives, secretaries, physiotherapists."" There is a nice, irrelevant lunacy about this sort of exchange, and about the boy's concern that they eat a balanced diet, but, unlike Pinter at his best, these irrelevancies don't give the unspecified menace particular reality. They just distance it further, as the fancy drama it is.Although the figures in the landscape are rather blurred, the landscape itself is beautiful, and Losey builds his drama as much through it as through his two characters. They begin their flight by the sea and race through pastoral landscapes, deserts, canyons, swamps, until finally they meet their separate fates above the timber line, atop a mountain, on a field of summer snow. I liked both Shaw and McDowell, but my greatest admiration goes to Gilbert Chomat, the man who actually flew the helicopter in sequences that are terrifying in a completely comprehensible, nonmetaphysical way.",1971-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Intolerance,' Griffith's Spectacular, On TV Tonight in Near Its Entirety","D. W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" had its world premiere at the Liberty Theater on the evening of Sept. 5, 1916. It had cost a mind-bending $2-million to produce, starred just about everyone who was ever connected with Griffith, featured dozens of others not then very well known, like Eric Von Stroheim as a Pharisee (whom I've yet to find in the film), and it intercut four different stories of intolerance through the ages, locked together by the image (out of ""Leaves of Grass"") of a woman (Lillian Gish) rocking the cradle of humanity.The public, which has never liked to have its mind bent, was apparently confused. The film was a financial failure. The critics, who were in awe of Griffith, were respectful of the film, but bored by everything except its spectacle.It is not difficult to find flaws in such a giant work, but they are small flaws, and it is an idiot's pleasure to dwell upon them, as John Howard Lawson once did when he complained that nothing happened to the woman rocking the cradle. Knowing Lawson's ideas, I suppose he would have liked the woman, towards the end of the film, to abandon the cradle to take up arms at the barricades of Babylon, to kneel at the foot of the cross in Jesus's Judea, to throw a cobblestone at Catherine de Medici after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, and to be on hand, in the modern sequence, when The Dear One saves The Boy from the gallows.""Intolerance,"" however, doesn't have much to do with the sort of perfectly composed screenplays Lawson analyzes at such length in his ""Theory and Technique of Playwriting and Screenwriting."" Like all great art, it transcends the theories and techniques that give some order to lesser art.Tonight, almost 55 years after its New York opening, ""Intolerance"" will be shown for what I'm told is the first time in something approximating its entirety on New York television, beginning at 9 o'clock on Channel 13, as part of the series titled ""The Silent Years."" An uncommonly genial Orson Welles, who is a great moviemaker himself when he is not voicing the little homilies of Eastern Airlines (""It's impossible to remain a stranger when someone asks you to pass the yams""), is the host for the series that is allowing us to see, at home, some of the greatest films of the silent era (""Broken Blossoms,"" ""The Gold Rush""), as wel as a lot of representative ones, all from the collection of Paul Killam,Although I have some nagging reservations about the manner of this presentation of ""Intolerance,"" which I saw last week on a television monitor at Channel 13, I can't imagine that anyone who has the slightest interest in movies will miss this screening with a good conscience. I'm talking principally to those people who always mean to get to the Museum of Modern Art, and to Anthology Film Archives, but never quite make it.Of historical interest is the fact that the film, which is usually seen in conventional black and white, is being shown here in what are described as the original color tints designed by Griffith. Like so many silent moviemakers, Griffith sought to reinforce the moods of his drama by switching from one tint of color film stock to another, from scene to scene. The tints I saw the other day are lovely  soft blues, ambers, pinksand have the effect of giving mellow life to what Welles rightly describes as the 19th-century theater tradition out of which Griffith came.It is not difficult to marvel at the physical spectacle of ""Intolerance""  the Babylonian sequence and Griffith's extraordinary crane shots have never been equalled; nor does it take a film buff to appreciate what has been called (maybe twice too often) the fugue-like structure of the film, the careful tempo of the cross-cutting that finally culminates in a positive orgy of interrelated, simultaneous climaxes, in Judea, Babylon, Paris and ""a western American city"" in 1916.""Intolerance,"" however, has a lot more than this. It has, among other things, some beautiful performances, particularly by Mae Marsh as The Dear One, a modern strike sequence that is as stark and straight as a Dreiser exposition, and, over all, the sensibility of a romantic, extremely complicated man who, after the racial madnesses of ""The Birth of a Nation,"" came forth with an essay on intolerance, which so often gets away from its subject that, if the title cards were removed, you might forget about intolerance completely.Don't be bothered by those title cards (""The loom of fate weaves death for The Boy's father""). They are part of the literature of an era, and if you find them camp, the fault is not in the film.I'm bothered, however, by two aspects of this showingthe fact that it is accompanied by a busy piano score that I found insistent and intolerable, and not comparable to what I imagine the live symphony orchestra accompaniment to have been originally. It gets awfully cute. I'm also sorry that, because of technical problems, the film has to be projected at the sound-film speed of 24 frames a second, which is why all the characters seem to walk like penguins. The film was shot at speeds varying from 12 to 20 frames a second, which, when properly projected, give as life-like an illusion of action as do contemporary films.I would hope that people coming upon ""Intolerance"" will take this into consideration. Silent movies did not. in fact, look ""funny."" If you want to check this out, Anthology Film Archives, located in Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Theater complex on Lafayette Street, will next be showing ""Intolerance"" in their repertory on Sept. 29 at 8 P.M.",1971-07-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Black Peter':Forman's 1964 Movie at Cinema Village,"Although it opened only yesterday, at the Cinema Village, ""Black Peter"" was made in 1964 and was the first full-length movie by the Czechoslovak director Milos Formanwho then went on to make ""Loves of a Blonde,"" ""Firemen's Ball,"" and, in America, ""Taking Off."" I originally saw ""Black Peter"" six years ago, at the third New York Film Festival, and I didn't much like it. But I liked it a lot when I saw it again the other day, which may prove that anything, even a movie critic, can improve with time.It may prove something else, however; a law I'd never care to formulate, but which might suggest that certain works of art, and especially certain movies, only get to look as good and as individual as they really are after their time has past. ""Black Peter"" is very much a film of the early nineteen-sixties, of the life styles and movie styles of the time, and when it first played here, I think that many of us had grown prematurely weary of the early nineteen-sixties  and of the era of cultural cross-fertilization that brought the techniques and subjects of the New Wave and the Twist and the bikini to Eastern Europe.But now Forman's obligations, though no less apparent, seem less important. And the style, which had looked like feeble imitation, reveals itself as a personal understanding of a particularly subtle, genial, unassertive kind. ""Unassertive"" may be the operative word here, for Forman's specialty in ""Black Peter"" is a comedy so quiet that it sometimes becomes positively mute.Peter (Ladislav Jakim), at the age of 17, takes a job in a supermarket, where he is made store detective. Like Truffaut's Antoine Doinel, to whom he is a kind of inarticulate first cousin, he thus finds himself in a position of considerable low-level responsibility, with which he is completely unable to cope.He arrests no shopliftersthough he does follow one suspicious character all the way home without stopping him because he can't think of what he should say. With similar mastery he courts his girl (Pavla Martinkova) and suffers the lectures on success and manly labor, that are regularly provided him by his father (Jan Ostroil, in an ultimately hilarious performance).""Black Peter"" doesn't really have a story, even in the way that Truffaut's Antoine movies have stories, and, given Forman's comic vision, it is proper that it should not. Instead it has a series of events and interconnected anecdotes and a sense, absolutely unassailable, that even behind its most threatening mask, life bares a face of disarming helplessness. ""Black Peter"" isn't about anything so pretentious as the brotherhood of man, but it acknowledges a brotherhood of man (and women) that is at once consoling and quite sadly funny.For the most part, ""Black Peter"" is about a small town's summer months, and I cannot remember a film so wonderfully sensitive to summer pleasures. Teen-age dances, swimming in a river, a band concert, luncheons, songs by local talent at the central restaurant. Forman's studies of amateur musical aspiration would in themselves make a movie, and his willingness to value such aspiration at any level of achievement would go a long way toward indicating in what spirit a movie ought to be made.Nobody, finally, can say what he means, and so everybody stumbles into an embarrassed, or merely feckless, silence. This is very funny, but more importantly it is also very true. For in that pause between the gesture and the word, between the intention and the meaning, lies the unspoken, the all but unspeakable awareness of the painful joy of daily living.",1971-07-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Honor and 'The Horsemen':Afghan Tale Opens at Local Theaters Lead Roles Shared by Sharif and Palance,"The time is now and Uraz (Omar Sharif), the son of Tursen (Jack Palance), the master of the stable for one of Afghanistan's feudal lords, is meant to seem a classic hero to those of us for whom life's most intense physical tests come in occasional races for seats on the IRT, often against feeble old ladies.Uraz is a master horseman, brave to the point of selfdestruction, who lives by a primitive code. He puts such stress on his honor that when he loses the buzkashi, an extraordinarily brutal riding tournament staged for the king at Kabul, he does penance by riding home, accompanied by his syce (man servant), by the most difficult possible mountain route. His broken leg, which is encased in a plaster cast he calls ""the evil box,"" begins to putrify, but Uraz hardly flinches when it is amputated with an ax.John Frankenheimer, who directed ""The Horsemen,"" and Dalton Trumbo, who adapted Joseph Kessel's novel, never do tell us what the Chapandaz, the Afghan horsemen, call amputation. However, they fill their film with so much other local color having to do with words, with taboos, with sports, with food, and even with handicrafts, that ""The Horsemen"" comes to resemble one of those approved, quite humorless comic strips that are intendend to instruct while they entertain.The film, which opened yesterday at theaters throughout the city, is not entirely humorless. Quite early on, I was moved to senseless giggles by the King James dialogue (""Peace on you, oh master of the stables"") that Trumbo has more or less preservedor cannedfrom the book. However, that rather thin, low pleasure was immediately succeeded by the thought that maybe that's just the way the Chapandaz would sound to an Afghan-speaking foreigner and, for all I know, how they sound to each other.More off-putting, at least to me, is the kind of romance that ""The Horsemen,"" both as a novel and as a film, represents. Here is fiction designed to glorify machismo of the most ignorant, savage sort, the cult of manliness that has, I suspect, its closest civilized equivalent in the totalitarian political movements of the 1930's, which put so much stress on style and very little on content.This may be taking ""The Horsemen"" a lot more seriously than was ever intended, but the thought arises since the film is an extension of two other recent Frankenheimer films, ""Grand Prix"" and ""The Gypsy Moths."" Both of these movies also had to do with machismo, with men testing themselves, pushing themselves to new limits of endurance, not because of any special financial or material gains, but because of those mysterious, antisocial ego needs sometimes called honor.Wrong-headedness can occasionally be moving and tragic, but ""The Horsemen"" is a remote, choppy adventure, chiefly interesting as the work of a director who, though his strength is contemporary melodrama (""The Young Savages,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate""), persists in pretending he's a romantic.Some of the movie was shot in Afghanistan, which you don't often see in movies these days, and some in Spain, which you do, but I'm not sure I could always tell the difference. After a while, all postcards look alike. In addition to Sharif and Palance, the cast includes Leigh Taylor-Young who, in other movies, has shown herself to be a promising comedienne. Here she plays an Untouchable whose problem is that everyone feels free to touch her, just about any time and any place.",1971-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Unfortunately, this potentially mixed bag of abnormal surgery and abnormal education merely adds up to tepid, not divertingly chilling fare.In the Spanish-made, largely English-dubbed ""House That Screamed,"" Lilli Palmer, as the militantly strict widowed operator of a turn-of-the-century French school for teen-aged girls is faced with a variety of strange problems. Her pupils obviously care more for a visiting woodsman, other girls and her son, John Moulder Brown, a strange, Peeping Tom type, than they do for Molire, sewing or the niceties of cuisine. And, they can't be blamed for wanting to break out of this gloomy manse, since several of their classmates already have mysteriously disappeared.""I want you to live a normal life,"" the anxious but suspicious Miss Palmer fervently assures her son. However, it gorily turns out, young Mr. Brown is far from the normal, placid, handsome teen-ager he seems to be. Miss Palmer and moviegoer deserve all the sympathy they can get.On the other hand, Bruce Dern, as the dour scalpelwielder responsible for ""The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant,"" really doesn't rate much sympathy. As a dedicated researcher who has clicked with two-headed snakes, rabbits and monkeys, if not with his photogenic, blonde wife, Pat Priest, he might have demurred in using a sex-crazed, homicidal maniac and a giant, mentally retarded farm hand for his human experiment. Movie plots notwithstanding, it soon becomes obvious that the best results he could expect would constitute an economy size menace to the community.""Too much imagination can destroy a man,"" Dern's best friend warns long before the monster destroys a half-dozen citizens.

us,Screen: 'The 7 Minutes':Court Is Focus of Russ Meyer's Latest,"Among the people who take him seriously, it is widely accepted dogma that the really good Russ Meyer disappeared with the last of his independent exploitationswith, among others, ""Lorna"" and ""Vixen"" and ""Harry, Cherry and Raquel""and that it has not re-emerged since he left the Devil and sold his soul to 20th Century-Fox with ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls."" None of the evidence disputes this judgment.And yet, I suspect that the theory is wrong, though the facts are right, that one bad movie doesn't make a falien idol, and that Russ Meyer will triumph even over clothes and nice-girl heroines and medium-budget respectabilityas he begins to do in ""The Seven Minutes,"" another bad movie, which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.Unlike most of his colleagues in the sex-and-violence field, Meyer appreciates his subject not just for kicks or as theme, but rather as a mode of personal expressiona little specialized, of course, but none the less real for all that. He has never been so much concerned with undressing his girls (there are maybe five seconds of nudity in ""The Seven Minutes"") as admiring their appetites, their overwhelming proportions (but not so much their seductive flesh), their often destructive and self-destructive wills.Against them he matches men, often inadequate to the women but overpowering to everything else, who booze and brawl and with a kind of gigantic clumsy gracefulness establish the profound parody of elemental force that is the basis for action in the Russ Meyer world. It is that world, and its wonderful specific manifestations in the north woods, in Southern backwaters, in a kind of small-business subdomesticity of the Los Angeles suburbs, that is most fatally lacking in ""The Seven Minutes.""The film is based on an unreadable Irving Wallace novel that millions of Americans have read, for all I know, with pleasure. The subject is obscenity law and the method is to quote every authority on the subject from Richard Kuh on up. It has a story in which a bright, young lawyer loses his fiance and his fortune but finds his soul (and another girl) while defending in court a novel called ""The Seven Minutes,"" by one J J Jadway. Meyer keeps the story, keeps a rather depressing number of the quotations, and though he slightly spices up everybody's private life, he centers his attention on the court case and its ramifications.I don't think that a court of law is the right Russ Meyer arena, and ""The Seven Minutes,"" which had started out pretty well, bogs down hopelessly in its courtroom legalisms and its absolutely non-cliff-hanging rush to unearth the real identity of the mythical J J Jadway. The plot is very complicated, and the cast of characters is enormous (and in at least one case  Wayne Maunder as the lawyer  rather good) and none of it is really amenable to that reduction to monumental simplicities that is near the center of Meyer's dramaturgy.On some of the peripheries, the film does well enough, however. For example, any Russ Meyer fan will appreciate the symbolic background musicwhen, in the gung-ho prosecuting attorney's office, a portrait of General MacArthur behind the desk, we begin to hear the Field Artillery Song on the sound track; or when, in a distinguished Columbia University professor's office, books lining the walls and Morningside Heights outside the window, softly we begin to hear ""Far Above Cayuga's Waters."" Or at one point when the search for J J Jadway takes our hero to a pornographic movie studio, just in passing we catch, tussling naked on a bed before the cameras, a guy, a girl and a gorilla.Several recent Russ Meyer films have featured an extra, semisubliminal added attraction in the form of an absolutely incredible girl wandering through who has nothing to do with the story but whom one would like to see more of. The girl in ""The Seven Minutes"" is Mora Gray, who plays a certain Miss Novickthe lawyer's secretaryand one would like to see more of her.",1971-07-24T05:00:00+0000

The gray, weathered clapboards are never painted, simply given a thin whitewash to retain the ghosttown atmosphere of the little fourstructure complex (shown at left). Inside, though, the Prentices' six years of remodeling is delightfully apparent. A war ren of six tiny rooms in the orig inal house, c. 1790, was turned into one enormous room with ex posed beams and rafters. The old kitchen fireplace was framed with a bright red partition (shown at right) that screens an overhead sleeping balcony. Where Prentice added new architectural elements, such as staircases or partitions, he outlined them in vibrant pri mary colors. It's a symbol of respect to the first builders, he explains.

It is a city of 375,000, an estimated 61 per cent Negro, 11 per cent Puerto Rican. It is a city with an overall unemployment rate of 14 per cent (25 to 30 per cent among blacks and Puerto Ricans); around 25 per cent of those who are employed work only parttime, and there are virtually no summer jobs and few programs for the city's 80,000 school children, who now roam the streets. As a result, one of every three Newarkers is getting some form of public assistance. There are, by conservative estimate, 20,000 drug addicts in the city, and only 7 per cent of them are being treated. New ark has the highest crime rate of any city in the nation; the highest per centage of substandard housing; the highest rates of venereal disease, new tuberculosis cases and maternal mor tality, and it is second in infant mor tality. Most of these rates, like the crime rate, are still rising.

The title hero of this well-aimed but misguided drama is a muscular young Indian, an ex-Green Beret, who periodically appears to save a ""freedom school,"" a group of idealistic young people, from bald harassment by small-town bigots and worse.That's the set-up of the film, nicely photographed in color. And some of the sensible utterances of the harassed youngsters have the quiet, authoritative ring of truth. While Tom Laughlin is a stoically effective Billy, the strongest thing about the film is Delores Taylor, as the school head. A plain-faced young woman, making her first movie, she somehow makes a flat, singsong monotone as penetrating as a lance.But the rest of the picture works none too well, under the rather studied direction of T. C. Frank. And some of the non-professional delivery of lines in the script by Mr. Frank and Teresa Christina is incredibly awful.Furthermore, the violence commences to pile on predictably and endlessly, with an assortment of town bullies and psychopaths right out of Western stereotypes. As for the folks out at the school, which often amounts to a stockade, they certainly are a genial, harmless bunch, bent on doing their own thing. But some of their guitar whimpering is terrible and several of those ""now"" pantomimes, meant to be amusing, are too cute for words.The whole picture nicely conveys a Southwestern atmosphere. But much too often, at the cost of plain credibility, it stacks its cards, characters and even credo like any rootin', tootin' Western.",1971-07-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Von Richthofen and Brown' Opens,"""Von Richthofen and Brown,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is an extraordinarily impressive movie by a filmmaker whose career has not always been marked by success, or even noble failure. Everyone identifies Roger Corman as a director of horror and action, and almost everyone knows the underground reputation according to which, say, ""XThe Man With X-ray Eyes"" becomes a phenomenological investigation, and ""The Masque of the Red Death"" a major essay in cinematic style.But people tend to forget the Corman movies that only make money, if that, of which there have been a fair number recently and to which ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" stands in gratifying contrast.In outline it is a film of great simplicity, following the careers of the German, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen and the Canadian, Arthur Royal Brown from the time they join their respective fighter-plane units near the front during World War I until the day in April, 1918, when von Richthofen is killed in the air, presumably by a bullet fired from Brown's Sopwith Camel.Much of the film's material must have originated in the minds of Corman or his screen writers, but its major events appear to be factincluding the final, near magical landing of the red Fokker triplane almost intact, carrying the body of the dead baron.By this last most beautiful and mysterious transformationin a film that rather specializes in mysterious, beautiful transformationsvon Richthofen is made still in time, having become his own memorial. And Brown, the type of the modern man (""I'm just a technician. I change things. Put a man and a plane in front of me and I change them into a wreck and a corpse . . ."") has become the creator of that memorial. The accounts I have read of air war are of course full of von Richthofen; but they mention Brown only in connection with von Richthofen's death.However, it is not the film's intention to reproduce history so much as it is to produce something more like a philosophical meditation on historical process, interpreted dramatically and interspersed with episodes of mortal combat. The project may seem all too easy, with von Richthofen, the reckless aristocrat and former cavalry officer done in by the efficient, common Brownand often enough it is too easy as von Richthofen (John Phillip Law) is exactly balanced by Brown (Don Stroud, the best of several good performances), many of whose lines seem composed as if in dialogue with a man he never meets.But if you can take the idea of a philosophical meditation seriously, as I think the film does, then something happens, not so much to the talk as to the framework, to the magnificent aerial fights, which are important not for their suspense (they are not very suspenseful) or for their beauty but for their quality of almost disembodied freedom.They are very realin the sense that they capture the feeling of flight as a privileged way of being rather than as superheated adventure. But they are also very strange. And Corman uses them for his most mystical demonstrations of how one thing becomes another, in which what goes up never comes down quite the same.There are a good many embarrassments in the film, and not the least is the decision to have all the Germans speak rather slangy English but with heavy German accents. Language itself becomes a problem in one scene, in which von Richthofen is introduced to his famous Fokker, which is identified with a gorgeously seductive blonde (typically, Brown's female contact is a French girl who has lost a leg) who sings him a song that begins, I swear, ""High is up, my hero, like a fabled knight of old. . . .""This is either terrible translation or, given the general drift of ""Von Richthofen and Brown,"" the first stage in a teleological argument.",1971-07-29T05:00:00+0000

us,On Any Sunday':Bruce Brown's Documentary Studies the Motorcyclist's View of Racing,"Some men hunt the great white shark. Some men join roller derbies, while others go to the moon. Some men like to knit. Some are freefall parachutists. Some spend their lives searching for the perfect woman or the perfect movie or the perfect wave. With the possible exception of knitting, all of these endeavors involve an element of risk, either physical or psychological, to such an extent that the attainment of the end becomes less important than the excitation provided by the pursuit itself.Five years ago Bruce Brown recorded one, round-the-world search for the perfect wave in ""The Endless Summer,"" which was a very beautiful movie to look at (especially from the relative safety of a cloudy smoking section) andI've now come to thinkmuch less simple-minded than it originally sounded.On the basis of his new film, ""On Any Sunday,"" a feature-length documentary about motorcycles and the men who ride them in apparent pleasurable competition, Brown stands in way of becoming the unofficial poet of the sports world. He not only records and shares with us the often extraordinary physical sensations experienced by the cyclists, but he also manages to suggest, in the absolutely flat language of the nonverbal participants, that the joy of the sport may also be the mask that hides a curse.Like clean-cut, monosyllabic Flying Dutchmen, Mert Lawwill and Malcolm Smith, the professional cyclists whose exploits Brown follows through the film, lead lives of enchanted circularity: the winning of one event is not as much a goal as the preface to still another competition, and another after that. The monetary rewards are never great and, often enough, the prizes are simply trophies. At the end of one race in which death might not have been too far removed, Brown, as his own narrator, is likely to say with his unerring knack for the anticlimactic comment: ""There stands Malcolm with a big grin.""Malcolm himself is likely to say: ""That was really neat:""It is not as silly as it sounds because the shape of the lives recorded by Brown are almost necessarily anticlimactic; that is, until someone gets hurt or (off-screen) killed.The movie itself is anything but anticlimactic. By putting his cameras on the cycles, Brown achieves audience-participation effects with speed that amount to marvelous delirium. The camera work is fancy, but it's a fanciness for a specific purpose, and ""On Any Sunday"" is the first film I can remember in months in which I thoroughly enjoyed the slow-motion, the zooms, the helicopter shots, the superimpositions and all those other techniques that are the tired rhetoric of the narrative cinema.There is, I suspect, no other way by which to communicate the sense of the intoxication that is the real goal of the cyclists, and that can only be realized through the intensification of all the perceptions.Brown records just about every kind of cycling competition there is, going from southern California to Spain and back again, catching drivers who insist on racing with broken legs, broken noses, and, in one instance, with a back broken six weeks before in an especially hazardous competition. ""What kind of men are these?"" Brown asks, and the answer comes not from what anyone says, but from the crazy, sensational motion of the film, which is, I feel, in its own way, a remarkable adventure, as simple and as unique to film as the picturization of movement.""On Any Sunday"" which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill, was, I understand, financed by Steve McQueen, who also shows up in the film from time to time as the very creditable cyclist he is.",1971-07-29T05:00:00+0000
