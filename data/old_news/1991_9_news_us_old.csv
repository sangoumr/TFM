He pleaded guilty to two robberies in exchange for a 35-year sentence that will make him eligible for parole in about eight and a half years.

There are not one but several Ku Klux Klans, pockets of goose-stepping Nazis in the American heartland, extremist outlaws tied to groups like Posse Comitatus, Aryan Nations, skinheads and a host of others. There is the White Aryan Resistance, which last year was assessed $3 million in punitive damages in a civil suit for inducing skinhead thugs to beat an Ethiopian man to death on the streets of Seattle in 1988; there are the ministers of the Christian Identity movement who preach that Jews are the sons of Satan, and there are all sorts of racist cousins preaching hate under different names. Even for journalists who cover these groups, it is hard to know who's who. Fortunately, James Ridgeway, the Washington correspondent for The Village Voice, has written an excellent overview of the subject, BLOOD IN THE FACE: The Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, Nazi Skinheads, and the Rise of a New White Culture (Thunder's Mouth, Cloth, $29.95; Paper, $19.95). The provocative title refers to one racist formula for distinguishing who is ""Aryan"" and who is not: whether the person blushes, or gets ""blood in the face."" Mr. Ridgeway includes this and other tidbits in ""Blood in the Face,"" which is almost a guidebook through the nether regions of the racist universe. Here is the Order, a splinter group of the Aryan Nations, whose adherents machine-gunned the Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg in 1984. Here is Gordon Kahl, a member of Posse Comitatus who was involved in a shoot-out that left three law enforcement officers dead before he was shot to death in 1983 in Arkansas.

The conflict has its roots in separatist drives on the part of Slovenes and Croats who fear a new sense of assertiveness by Serbs in the post-Communist era; the situation is complicated by the fact that large numbers of Serbs have settled amid the other nationalities over the centuries. Since June 25, when Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence of the central Yugoslav Government, ethnic Serbs living in Croatia have revolted and about 350 people have died in violence in that republic, while more than 125,000 have left their homes. Last week, scores of people died in new clashes despite efforts to enforce a cease-fire between units of the federal army and the separatist republic's militia. The army claims only to be trying to separate Croatian units from the rebel forces of ethnic Serbs; last week, however, a European Community envoy, Henry Wijnaendts, agreed with Croatian accusations that the Serb-dominated army was taking the side of the Serb rebels. As the latest cease-fire came apart last week, tanks rolled, mortar fire resounded and Yugoslav army jets bombed targets in and near Vukovar and other Croatian villages. The most realistic prospect seemed to be for more fighting, on an even grimmer scale.",1991-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Last week, largely as a result of his mother's negotiating skill, the New York Yankees agreed to pay the 19-year-old Mr. Taylor a $1.55 million signing bonus, the most ever commanded by an amateur baseball draftee. An offer of $650,000 had been on the table for weeks, with Mrs. Taylor hinting that it might not be enough to keep her son from going on to college in September. Mrs. Taylor held firm at the family home in Beaufort, N.C., and the Yankees blinked. Scott Boras, a sports agent who advised the Taylors, said that when Mrs. Taylor met with the Yankees' general manager, Gene Michael, she was ""fully apprised"" of the value of her son's 98-mile-an-hour fastball. When Mr. Taylor arrived for the ceremonial contract signing, Mr. Michael recalled, ""He told me, 'I never saw this many cameras.' "" Mr. Michael added, ""I never saw that many myself.""

George: The former head of covert operations at the Central Intelligence Agency was indicted yesterday on 10 counts of obstructing Congressional and Federal investigations of the Iran-contra affair. Oliver L. North: The former Marine lieutenant colonel who served as a staff member of the National Security Council was indicted on March 16, 1988, on 16 counts. Four counts were dropped. He was convicted May 4, 1989, of three felony counts: aiding and abetting construction of Congress, destroying National Security Council documents and accepting an illegal gift. He was acquitted of nine counts. He was sentenced July 5, 1989, to two years' probation and 1,200 hours of community service and fined $150,000 On July 20, 1990, a Federal appeals court suspended all three felony convictions. The court reversed the conviction on the charge of destroying classified documents. The court also ordered the trial court to re-examine the evidence used against Mr. North at his trial to see if the evidence used to convict him had been tainted by Congressional testimony that he gave under a grant of immunity from prosecution. On May 27, 1998, the Unitied States Supreme Court let the appellate court decision stand. A hearing is scheduled next week that could force the judge in the case to throw out the guilty verdicts. Thomas G. Clines: The former C.I.A. agent was a business partner of Richard V.Secord, a retired Air Force major general, and Albert A. Hakim, an Iranian-born businessman, in supplying arms to Iran. He was convticed Sept. 18, 1990, on four felony counts involving the underreporting of his earnings to the Internal Revenue Service in 1986 and 1987 and falsely telling the Government that he had no foreign bank accounts. He was sentenced Dec. 13, 1990, to 16 months in prision and fined $40,000. He has appealed. John M. Poindexter: President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser from December 1985 to November 1986 was indicted March 16, 1988, on seven counts. Two counts, wire fraud and theft of Government porperty, were dropped and a charge of conspiracy to defraud the Government was narrowed to conspiracy to obstruct Congress. He was convicted April 7, 1990, on five counts involving charges that he obstructed, conspired to obstruct and made false statements to Congresss. He was sentenced June 11, 1990, to six months in prison. He has appealed his conviction. COOMPLETED CASES Mr. Hakim, Robert C. McFarlane, Mr. Secord, Carl (Spitz) Channell and Richard R. Millwer all pleaded guilty to assorted charges arising from their roles in the Iran-contra dealings. They were all sentenced to probation with some also required to pay fines or perform comunity service. Alan D. Fiers pleaded guilty on July 9, 1991, to withholding information from Congress. Mr. Fiers, the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency's Central American Task Force, had worked for Mr. George. The case against Joseph F.

us,Guidepost; Adjustable Mortgages,"Adjustable-rate mortgages, down to levels not seen in many years, are currently attractive alternatives to the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, which is now about 8.98 percent. A decision depends not only on rates but on how long an owner plans to stay in a home and how high interest rates might go over the life of the mortgage. (Someone who plans to move in five years, for example, may benefit more from an adjustable rate than someone who expects to stay a longer period.) In most cases the adjustables, known as ARM's, have caps, usually a maximum of two percentage points a year and six points over the life of the loan. The table shows the monthly payments on two $100,000 ARM's with an initial average rate of 6.78 percent. One rises a percentage point annually; the other, two percentage points. By comparison, the monthly payment on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on $100,000 at 8.98 percent would be $803.18; the four-year total would be $38,552.63. *2*ARM (w/1 point rise) *2*ARM (w/2 point rise) Rate Payment Rate Payment Year 1 6.78% $650.59 6.78% $650.59 Year 2 7.78 717.13 8.78 786.10 Year 3 8.78 784.79 10.78 927.80 Year 4 9.78 853.31 12.78 1,073.97 Total $36,069.84 $41,261.52 (Source: Bank Rate Monitor, North Palm Beach, Fla.)",1991-09-07T05:00:00+0000

us,THE STORY OF A STREET PERSON,"Elizabeth Swados's article ""The Story of a Street Person"" (Aug. 18) was one of the most moving I've read on the joys and agony of loving, living with and, ultimately, losing a family member to schizophrenia. These impossible but wonderful people are never ""just"" crazy, and their stories are never simple. There are no easy solutions, and there are times when there is no choice but to let them live their lives as they insist upon living them, wrenching as that may be. And while there is no one to blame, there is no way to protect oneself (or one's family) from the feelings of guilt and shame that come from watching these souls deteriorate. When you've lost a loved one to the street or to the ravages of mental illness, it becomes impossible to think of ""them"" and ""us.""

Last week, after 19 months of legal wrangling, all the parties involved, including the closest surviving relative of Officer Milledge, agreed on a disposition that would satisfy the law but set Mr. Strachan free. In return for pleading guilty to manslaughter, he is to be sentenced to the 19 months he has spent in a New York jail and seven years of probation.

Even before he became synonymous with crass commercialism, this pioneer of Surrealism was among the century's most controversial and colorful figures. Although his very popularity and buffoonery probably hurt his critical reputation, to all evidence Dali's work has been neglected and dismissed by the art establishment. Two years after his death, the arrival of DALI: The Salvador Dali Museum Collection (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $45) serves as a reminder that the range and caliber of his earlier painting were indeed overshadowed by the countless scribbles and blank-page signings he merchandised as ""Art"" in the later part of his career. Offering 92 paintings and 68 drawings and watercolors spanning the years 1917 to 1974, the book also includes a foreword by A. Reynolds Morse, the owner of the collection, and an introductory essay by Robert S. Lubar, a professor at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York City. Though it may be true, as Mr. Lubar says, that ""Dali's paintings offer more than a clever transcription of his systematized confusion,"" Mr. Lubar's own rather dense prose offers less. With Dali's ""adherence to a Hegelian dialectical model"" and his ""using vision to discredit reality"" offered by way of explanation, it's still hard to apprehend what Mr. Lubar means when he claims that ""Dali establishes a substitute world whose appearance is mediated by volition."" While apparently Dali was never really taken seriously enough, Mr. Lubar inadvertently demonstrates that it's equally possible to take him too seriously at the same time. As handsomely reproduced in these pages, the pictures themselves provide the best testimony for Mr. Morse's contention that Dali should be recognized ""as a major factor in twentieth-century art.""",1991-09-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Good Credit,"Some law enforcement authorities in Pakistan didn't think Asif Ali Zardari could have done nearly as well as he did in business if his wife, Benazir Bhutto, had not been Prime Minister. In particular, Mr. Zardari stood accused of using his wife's influence while she was in office to force the state-run Habib Bank to lend $34 million to a hotel in London. Ms. Bhutto's supporters insisted that and other charges against Mr. Zardari were politically motivated. And so far, at least, there is apparently no evidence to support the prosecution. In May, two bank fraud charges against him were dropped and last week the Habib Bank case was dismissed. But Mr. Zardari, who spent nearly a year in jail, still faces trial on some other charges, ones that, on conviction, are punishable by death by hanging.

Paris Descending a Staircase","The bronze heads of angry horses stand guard over a butcher's shop; sphinxes, fish and hydras spurt water in every direction; Napoleon waits behind a shop window; a waiter at Les Deux Magots looks just like the man in a ceramic shop sign. This is the city the photographer Michael Woods has recorded in recent years in PARIS AND THE SURREALISTS (Thames and Hudson, $35), a Paris more poetic and compelling than dreams, the city that the Surrealists cherished and that remains a Surrealist's paradise. The text by George Melly, the author of ""Revolt Into Style,"" skillfully blends his own observations with selective accounts of what Andre Breton, Louis Aragon and others made of Paris; he illuminates the power the city held, and still holds, over the imagination. Paris was the Surrealists' mistress, Mr. Melly writes, and ""its femininity acted as the ideal Surrealist muse; a role the movement assigned, much to the recent indignation of some women liberationists, to 'Woman' in general. No other city has this quality. Most cities are masculine."" And indeed, from stone statues in parks and squares to busts in a wax museum or a flea market, an antique medical corset or even legs dangling in a shop window advertising nylons, Paris still speaks of woman in an infinity of ways, many of which Mr. Woods has captured.

He warns against the spate of airline bankruptcies -- an excellent sign of vigorous competition. He tells us that profit margins at the major carriers are low -- again, precisely what you would expect of a competitive industry. Even the decrease in super-discount fares is quite consistent with a competitive market; when the Government stops fixing prices, we would expect to see a substantial dispersion in prices initially, as producers and consumers test out the newly freed market. Eventually, those producers who price too low (People Express) and those whose inefficiencies keep them from pricing low enough (Eastern) drop out, and an equilibrium price level emerges.",1991-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Celebrating the Day","The fiction and poetry of Grace Paley and the art of Vera B. Williams have always had a political edge. In LONG WALKS AND INTIMATE TALKS (The Feminist Press at the City University of New York, Cloth, $29.95; Paper, $12.95), these two women have collaborated on a book to protest against militarism, racism, sexism and, as Ms. Paley says, ""to celebrate the day, which is its own reason for peace."" Ms. Paley's fiction is inspired by folk tales; she writes jaunty, resonant stories that have their roots in the Old World but blossom fully in the New. The ""intimate talks"" that are collected here -- many just two and three pages long -- seem part of an oral tradition in the making. Indeed, several are called ""Conversations."" They often take place among Faith (Ms. Paley's familiar alter ego), her unruly parents in the Home for the Golden Ages, her circle of friends and her fellow resisters on marches and sit-ins. Readers will find here the quintessential Grace Paley: the fond attention to character, the amusing jumble of various dictions, the anger of love, the patience of understanding and the energy of commitment. She writes most brilliantly about the extended family, which in her vision includes people from halfway around the world whose suffering travels ""in no time at all into TV sets and newsrooms."" The poems focus mostly on these sufferers, and Vera B. Williams has painted rich accompanying portraits to illustrate them. She has a gift for evoking whimsy and pleasure, even amid destruction. The book, the first in a new series called Women and Peace, is a call for political action based on deep joy and a willingness to share in the suffering of others. It makes one wonder why art has ever wanted to transcend politics.",1991-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Guidepost; Lower Mortgage Rates,"To stimulate the real estate market, mortgage lenders have been lowering rates to levels not seen since 1978. For homeowners with mortgages negotiated in recent years, this offers an opportunity to refinance. Getting the most out of refinancing depends not only on the lower rate but also on how long an owner plans to stay in a house. For those planning on staying three years or less, the rule of thumb is that a new mortgage rate should be at least 2 percentage points below the old rate in order to realize a benefit from the new closing costs. Homeowners expecting to stay at least six years need a rate at least one percentage point lower than their current rate to recover closing costs. Here are the national average rates this week for the most popular mortgages compared to rates a year ago. The rate given for a one-year adjustable rate mortgage, known as ARM, is the average introductory rate for an ARM with a 30-year term.

An unusual number of films have incorporated sections of unrelated or incomplete material into their larger schemes. So Gus Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" combines a road story about Portland hustlers with latter-day Shakespeare. Arturo Ripstein's ""Woman of the Port"" tells parts of the same tale from three different viewpoints. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" has its parallel heroines; Atom Egoyan's film ""The Adjuster"" begins with seemingly disconnected elements and gradually brings together the pieces. And Peter Greenaway's ""Prospero's Books"" interweaves a dazzling array of disparate ingredients into a full-scale assault on ""The Tempest.""",1991-09-29T05:00:00+0000

Mr. DeCosta, a Rhode Island crane operator who began doing his Paladin act in 1947, said he first learned that he was being imitated when people began to congratulate him on having a television series in 1957, when ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" went on the air. Mr. DeCosta won the first of his several suits against CBS and its former subsidiary, Viacom International, in 1966, only to see the verdicts overturned on appeal. Last week, however, the 83-year-old horseman appeared finally to have won one. A jury in Federal district court in Providence ordered Viacom to pay Mr. DeCosta $3.5 million for violating his trademark, registered in 1977, by distributing the half-hour series in syndication.

Mr. Morehouse, a former reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, is more of a guide than a historian, embellishing his meanderings about the Waldorf with entertaining anecdotes and portraits of those who have been the lifeblood of its fame, such as Elsa Maxwell and Cole Porter. The Waldorf is 60 years old this year, and the author reminds us that it opened during the Great Depression, the descendant of the original Waldorf-Astoria that occupied the site, until 1929, where the Empire State Building now stands. It is a hotel big enough to handle Golda Meir and Yasir Arafat at the same time, without embarrassment to anyone, and vast enough to need computers to sort out the task of housekeeping, with a staff of nearly 400 for the 1,850 rooms to be cleaned. Mr. Morehouse writes of pleasures and scandals, of the hard facts of running a hotel and of its romance. This is not the last word on the Waldorf-Astoria, and the publisher is to be chided for neglecting to provide readers an index.

Except for their fluorescent lighting, these factories are not that different from the sweatshops that Jacob Riis uncovered a century ago. When Riis's ""How the Other Half Lives,"" a graphic chronicle of New York's slums, was published in 1890, it shocked the nation, prompting the city to pass the first important legislation imposing health standards to make tenements more livable. But some of the progress made has proved illusory. At the turn of another century, guns, drugs and race are redefining urban poverty, which seems to have grown deeper and more ubiquitous since the time Riis prowled the streets of the Lower East Side as a police reporter. Half the children born this year are likely to be on welfare before they turn 18; when they die, about 1 in 25 New Yorkers will be buried in a pauper's grave.",1991-09-29T05:00:00+0000
