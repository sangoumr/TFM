On the medal stand later, he didn't raise an arm in triumph; he didn't even smile. He didn't seem to be enjoying the moment, as Rowdy Gaines, Tiffany Cohen, Theresa Andrews and those on the American women's 400 freestyle relay team had in the gladness of their gold. Instead, he had wrapped himself in gloom, a golden gloom. ''I expected a little more out of myself for some reason,'' he was saying now. ''I've been that fast in workouts. I expected to be better in the Olympics.'' After leading the qualifiers yesterday morning with a time of 1 minute 58.99 seconds, Rick Carey had predicted that he would break his world record of 1:58.86 in Tuesday night's final. ''It will definitely be a world record,'' he had said. ''If I can bring it home, I hope I can go 1:57.'' In the final he didn't even break 2 minutes. His time was 2:00.23, fast for any other world backstroker, but slow for him. And in keeping with his reputation as a perfectionist, the 21-year-old University of Texas senior from Mount Kisco, N.Y., did not hide his disappointment.

Mr. Briscoe, a trucking executive, was the top bidder at an auction held in Mesquite, Tex., by the Internal Revenue Service.

After the phone company's big breakup, however, it's a whole new phone game, modeled on the old green stamp template. A.T. & T. has announced it will award ''Opportunity Credits'' on a dollar-for-dollar basis for each month's long-distance charges totaling $15 or more. The credits may then be used to buy consumer products at a discount. Call Seattle, say, and talk for two hours to reduce the price of a pickup truck. Call a friend in San Francisco for a lengthy palaver and earn credit for some corduroy trousers. A long telephonic klatsch with someone in Tucson helps with the purchase of a digital coffee maker or cordless shrub trimmer.","The long-distance credit, however, is not the same as a toaster for a bank deposit or a croquet set for supermarket receipts.

Mondale and many other Democrats have been trying to kill. Mr. Simpson called for the appointment of a House-Senate conference committee to develop a compromise version of the legislation acceptable to President Reagan and to the Democratic- controlled House. The Wyoming Republican said Mr. Reagan had given an assurance he would sign a compromise immigration bill if it were less costly than the one passed by the House. The White House said last week that the House version was ''unacceptable.'' Despite differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill, both measuress would prohibit employment of illegal aliens, authorize penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens and offer legal status to many illegal aliens already in the United States. The House passed the bill by a five-vote margin, 216 to 211, on June 20. The Senate approved a similar bill, 76 to 18, in May 1983. The bill has been back in the Senate for six weeks, but the Senate has not requested a conference, the normal procedure for reconciling differences on major legislation. Opponents of the bill said that if a conference committee came up with a compromise measure they had enough votes to block its approval on the floor of the House. The Democratic candidates for President and Vice President, Mr. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro, strongly oppose the measure and have denounced it in speeches.",1984-08-04T05:00:00+0000

''Murder for Pleasure,'' the first historical analysis of detective stories published in the United States, appeared in 1941, exactly 100 years after the publication of the first detective story - Edgar Allan Poe's ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue.'' Katherine Woods wrote in The Book Review that the book ''makes an encyclopedic appeal to real students of this genre; and not merely in the comprehensiveness of its main historical text, but also in its bibliography and lists of authors, in its detective story quiz, and in its chapters on the rules and the democratic alliances of detective fiction.'' THE BRIDGE ON THE DRINA, by Ivo Andric. (University of Chicago, $8.95.) A widely translated Yugoslav book, ''The Bridge on the Drina'' was published in 1945. In 1961 Ivo Andric won the Nobel Prize in Literature. The book is about Serbian men and women and how a bridge constructed in the 16th century and destroyed in World War I affected their lives. In his review, Stoyan Christowe wrote: ''Mr. Andric possesses keen insight into human motivation. His characters attain stature and become memorable not so much by their actions as by the author's probing into their souls and minds. He dissects, analyzes, interprets. There is no indirection or implication. Everything is said, stated, but always in readable prose.''",1984-08-05T05:00:00+0000

In ''Next Boat From Douala,'' Morgan Leafy, a youngish, fat, white diplomat in postcolonial West Africa, catches gonorrhea in a local brothel. Then, drunk after a Christmas party, he lies in a Volkswagen bus with Doreen, the wife of his colleague Brian. Conscience catches him at the crucial moment - ''Then he thought of impregnating Doreen, his putrid seed in her womb, Brian's innocent alarm at the diseased monster he'd inadvertently produced. He thought of Brian diseased too, a loathsome spiral of infection, a little septic carbuncle festering in Africa behind him.'' He desists, and the lady is displeased. This tale is told in graphic physical detail with what reads like a pastiche of Graham Greene as a backdrop: ''Fat sausage flies . . . whirled and battered about him. Ungainly on their wings, one landed in his gin and drowned there, straddled on the cubes.'' Comic? It's hard to supply the demanded hearty laughter. The moral too, is glib.",1984-08-05T05:00:00+0000

One analyst said that the cooling was caused by profit-taking, but said the rally was ''only resting temporarily.'' (Page D1.)

This week's flow of economic statistics should confirm this view. On Tuesday, for example, national retail sales figures for July should be up five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent in June. The gains will be relatively strong largely because of continued vigorous auto sales, said Jack W. Lavery, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. Auto makers are still subsidizing financing costs, he noted, and without auto figures, the gain would be considerably less. ''Consumers are still confident, but their mood may be changing,'' Mr. Lavery said. ''We expect the outstanding consumer credit figure for June on Tuesday to show a rise of $6.5 billion, down from the $10.2 billion rise in May.''",1984-08-12T05:00:00+0000

In the Yiddish tradition I will answer the question with a question: why shouldn't this legend have influenced and intrigued creative minds? It possesses the tension and the suspense of the supernatural. It is based on a faith almost as old as the human species - namely, that dead matter is not really dead but can be brought to life.

Police had to extricate the six employees trapped inside. Yet three days later, after more charges of abuse, some parents brought their children back. ''Why stop the whole world?'' one mother said.

Among the books to read, there are the memoirs of great European dealers of the recent past like Ambroise Vollard and Daniel- Henry Kahnweiler. There is S. N. Behrman's immensely diverting life of Duveen. Among American growths, there are Julien Levy's ''Memoir of an Art Dealer'' and John Bernard Myers's recent and hugely mischievous ''Tracking the Marvelous.'' It probably helps to have been to business school. It is also a help to have family money, if you know how to use it, and to have served an apprenticeship with the best dealer who will take you on. But fundamentally, like the aspirant conductor, you just have to stand up in full view of the public. If you're no good, they'll tell you.",1984-08-12T05:00:00+0000

''As I said it, I knew the danger of those kinds of comparisons,'' said Miss Switzer, who ran the 1967 Boston Marathon bundled in a sweatsuit because women were not allowed to compete and who led the successful lobby for the women's Olympic marathon as the director of sports programs for the Avon Company.

By Ron Suskind I'VE GOT THIS SENATOR in his office,'' says Robert Goodman, ''and I'm shooting for three hours.'' The 55-year-old media consultant leans over the dinner table in a Maryland restaurant, sharing the events of his day. As he talks, his taut, wiry body begins to vibrate, hands waving, voice rising with the measured beat of a theatrical entertainer. ''I fire questions at him. I berate him. I say, 'Don't give me that stuff. Answer the question. Tell me what you feel.' The whole time, he's on camera. I've never brought the camera in this close. Finally he forgets it's there. He's sweating, getting mad, tie loosened, vulnerable.''","There is no script to the television commercial Goodman is describing, just the lights and cameras and the consultant peppering the candidate with questions. The goal of the advertisements is to change the voters' perception of an already well-known public figure, and Goodman wants his subject - in this case, Senator Roger W. Jepsen, Republican of Iowa - with his defenses down. ''That works,'' he says. ''The voters have heard about this person, or seen him from a distance, but now they're close. Here's who he really is.

Our reviewer, Robert Shaplen, wrote, ''Roy relates the basic facts perceptively and brilliantly and uses his novelistic technique to examine the motives and personalities of the various participants; he makes the whole tragedy come poignantly alive.'' Mr. Shaplen added that Americans reading the book will better comprehend Asia's revolution. WINTER'S TALE, by Mark Helprin. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Mark Helprin won the National Jewish Book Award in 1982 for ''Ellis Island and Other Stories'' and lavish praise for ''Winter's Tale,'' published in 1983. The novel focuses on a series of interconnected heroic lives, chiefly that of Peter Lake, orphan, burglar, lover, idealist, mechanic first class. Benjamin DeMott wrote in The Book Review that ''a piercing sense of the beautiful arising from narrative and emotional fantasy is everywhere alive in the novel. And because the novelist commits himself throughout to the pursuit of nourishing truths - truths of justice, hope and cheer remote from the more fashionable truths of alienation and despair - 'Winter's Tale' stands forth in its own right as restorer and comforter.''",1984-08-12T05:00:00+0000

He completed the 26-mile-385-yard course in an Olympic record time of 2 hours 9 minutes 21 seconds. He bettered the time of 2:09:55 set by Waldemar Cierpinski of East Germany at Montreal in 1976. Lopes finished 215 meters ahead of John Treacy of Ireland, who won his country's first medal in the 1984 Games with a second-place time of 2:09:56, just a second behind the Olympic record that had stood before this evening. Charles Spedding of Britain was third in 2:09:58. Lopes had won the world cross-country championship and had world-class success at 10,000 meters. But that did not explain how a 37-year-old loan officer from a Lisbon bank could run away from the best-known and most successful marathoners in the world to win his nation's first gold medal in track and field. Especially since he had suffered minor injuries on his left leg and arm after being hit by a car less than a month ago. ''There is no explanation,'' Lopes said. ''That's how it is.'' While the capacity crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum waited for a field that included the dominant names of the last several years, it first saw Lopes emerge from the tunnel at the southwest corner of the stadium.",1984-08-13T05:00:00+0000

At a White House luncheon commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Warsaw rising against Nazi troops, he said the United States ''rejects any interpretation of the Yalta agreement that suggests American consent for the division of Europe into spheres of influence,'' and that he would ''press for full compliance'' with the agreement, specifically its stipulation on free elections. (Page 1, Column 1.) Peru has taken tougher action against guerrillas, according to military and police sources. They say a more severe and systematic strategy involves military and psychological tactics and includes the use of terror as a dissuasive method and the formation of antiguerrilla peasant militias. Peruvian judicial and church sources say the army and police are increasingly resorting to kidnappings, torture and executions of civilians in their fight. (1:1.)",1984-08-18T05:00:00+0000

On Wednesday, that was confirmed, as the thrift reported a $582 million loss of funds, primarily from $1.4 billion in institutional withdrawals. Moreover, Financial reported a $107.5 million loss for the quarter ended June 30, the result of changing its accounting procedures at the insistence of the S.E.C. It was thought to be the largest quarterly loss ever reported by a thrift, and it cut the bank's net worth to 2.3 percent of its assets, well below its required 4 percent minimum. As fears mounted that the U.S. had another major banking crisis on its hands, trading in the thrift's certificates of deposit almost stopped, adding to its liquidity problems.

High on the list is artist turnover: promising young conductors, orchestras new to recording, and new conductor-orchestra relationships all deserve a moment in the sun, and they all feel they'll shine brightest in the great works. Older conductors, meanwhile, have traditionally been allowed to remake their catalogues every decade or two; and improvements in recording technology are often seen as sufficient reason to re-record even the most ubiquitous works. But the bottom line, both figuratively and literally, is that no matter how many competing versions there are, new recordings of standard fare almost invariably sell a lot of copies - some of them to listeners who want to update their collections, and some to newcomers to the classical record market.",1984-08-19T05:00:00+0000

That was that absolutely everyone wanted to talk about the theater, and almost everyone had some connection with it. Before I'd recovered from my jetlag, I'd been driven across town by a cabbie who had toured Europe in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' been shown an apartment by a man who ran a theater museum, been offered another by a retired actor, been sold a phone by a resting actor, bought a book from a woman who insisted on doing her imitation of John Gielgud, and, needless to say, been brought food and drink by an assortment of aspiring hoofers and assistant stage managers masquerading as waiters.

Initially, children's fashion began as mere adaptations of adult clothing. Then, due to the pioneer styling of Florence Eiseman and others, clothes were designed that were uniquely for children. Today, though, there appears to be a movement back toward dressing children in clothes that suggest the adult world. One of the reasons for this is that many name designers of women's and men's wear, both here and abroad, have added children's lines - scaled-down and simplified versions of their grown-up clothes - with the same quality of design and styling that adults demand.",1984-08-19T05:00:00+0000

An audience that knows, either on record or in live performance, the historically faithful version that Daniel Hertz edited in 1972 really does not need a cropped and recomposed ''Idomeneo,'' even if its author was himself a certified great composer. But, putting pure logic aside for the moment, there was an undeniable fascination in hearing what changes Strauss thought this noble opera needed if it were ever to be palatable to a large public. His was an effort much like Mozart's own arranging of Handel's ''Messiah,'' which also grants us a look into the mind of genius, however misguided the genius may seem from a modern viewpoint.",1984-08-19T05:00:00+0000

A major objective of this sprawling, generous, sometimes inspired book is to recover the artistic language of Michelangelo and Renaissance Italy. This means tracking words like anatomy, concept, fantasy, form, imitation, judgment, movement, order, proportion and quality through the vast and sometimes overgrown Western cultural forest first settled by the Greeks. Michelangelo was acclaimed by many contemporaries as the greatest artist who ever lived in part because they believed all roads through that forest led to him.",1984-08-19T05:00:00+0000

When Ted Allan, the co-author of ''Love Streams'' was a boy, his father whom he loved, had beaten him, and what had been a lovely relationship of a toy inventor and a little boy exchanging philosophical ideas turned into bitter memories. Because I loved my father and because Ted felt just the opposite toward his, our working together on a story directly related to fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, husbands, wives and the delicate balance of love took us through a four-year episode in which a play with dark overtones titled ''My Sister's Keeper'' later turned into a new film called ''Love Streams.''

It's even been a while since, in the early 70's, changing perceptions of men's and women's societal roles left Hollywood increasingly unable to deal with romantic relationships at all. Hollywood's bewilderment in a period of vigorous social change brought about movies in which the lovers never quite fell in love, or the kinds of working-woman stories in which Jane Fonda (as she did in ''The China Syndrome'') came home alone to a pet turtle and an answering machine.

us,New & Noteworthy,"HISTORY: A NOVEL, by Elsa Morante. (Aventura/ Vintage, $8.95.) Our reviewer, Robert Alter, wrote that ''History'' ''has a good many arresting moments.'' He said, ''There is a peculiar Dostoyevskian visionary quality in (Elsa) Morante's writing that occasionally illuminates her somber Naturalistic landscape. At a number of crucial junctures she manages to carry out wonderful forays into the uncanny, moving from bleak earthbound things to metaphysical vistas.'' The characters in this 1977 novel are ''downtrodden and . . . oppressed,'' and the setting is akin to that of Italian postwar neorealist films. A MOVING TARGET, by William Golding. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $7.95.) William Golding won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1983. When his nonfiction collec-tion ''A Moving Target'' was published in 1982, our reviewer, Jan Morris, felt no ''rush of grace or vision as Mr. Golding passes by,'' but she allowed that the best pieces were about writing novels. ''The care and balance of his craft - the demands of artistry and readability, the matter of theme, the interaction of thought and feeling - all are delicately and thrillingly explored and ought to make the book essential reading for less articulate writers in residence or associate professors.''",1984-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,MONEY: MAKING IT AND MULTIPLYING IT,"Karen W. Arenson is a reporter for the Business Day section of The New York Times. CORPORATE MESSIAH: The Hiring and Firing of Million-Dollar Managers. A financially troubled International Harvester lured Archie R. McCardell from Xerox with a multimillion-dollar compensation package, only to dismiss him five years later as the scapegoat for its worsening problems. Burdened with a high debt and lacking a long-term strategy, RCA recruited Maurice Valente from I.T.T., providing him an annual compensation of at least $600,000. He lasted five and a half months before being asked to resign. Puritan Fashions snared Warren Hirsh - the marketing genius who scrawled Gloria Vanderbilt's signature across the hip pockets of blue jeans - with the promise of more autonomy. Eight weeks later he was out on the street, $1 million richer. For anyone looking for problems in corporate America, the tales of hirings and firings in ''Corporate Messiah'' are a good place to start. They offer a peek into a fascinating corner of corporate management, where executive psyches often override any semblance of management rules or even common courtesy. Musical chairs is being played in the executive suite with increasing frequency, Patricia O'Toole, a business writer, says. Economic problems have sent companies searching for salvation in the form of a supremely capable executive, or corporate messiah. And businesses have been willing to pay extraordinary sums to attract extraordinary leaders. But the strategy has often backfired. When a new executive proves ''unable to walk on water,'' Miss O'Toole notes, his days are numbered.",1984-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Experimenting with offbeat cone materials, more efficient magnets, and revving up their computers to ferret out previously unexplored design possiblities, these companies tackled the intractable problems of small speakers.

Such is the case with Tennessee Williams's ''Vieux Carre'' and Lanford Wilson's ''Balm in Gilead,'' both seen recently in revivals, the Williams at the Williamstown Theater Festival, the Wilson at the Circle Repertory Company. In each instance, events that the playwrights were later to shape into various artistic semblances are encountered in their natural state. It is almost as if after seeing art, we now are confronted with the reality that inspired it. The plays are prophetic as well as experiental. They tell us about the making of art and the making of a playwright - each a major American playwright with a lyric sensibility - approaching themes, attempting motifs and experimenting with style. We learn about the playwright's life as it crucially affects his work.",1984-08-26T05:00:00+0000

The team of Bromley/Jacobsen created an entire media world in a room they designed for the Kip's Bay Show House in New York. Sitting in a space-age love seat, one can, with a mere flick of a switch, control everything from television monitor to tape deck. ''Much of this new equipment is beautiful to look at,'' says Robin Jacobsen.",1984-08-26T05:00:00+0000
us,CLOUD OF COMPLACENCY SHADOWS G.O.P. 'SPRINGTIME OF HOPE',"DALLAS BY the standards that customarily apply to President Reagan, acknowledged by friend and foe alike as the nation's consummate political performer, last week's reviews and the response were surprisingly tepid. Mr. Reagan's speech accepting renomination lasted almost an hour. A laundry list of Democratic failings lent it an uncharacteristically negative tone. By the time the President reached his extended peroration, with its trademark rhetorical flourishes about ''a springtime of hope for America,'' both the speaker and audience seemed to be flagging. In the end, they were joined in a mood of subdued optimism. The convention closed without the cresting emotion that would seem to be in order for a candidate who many think may be on the verge of an electoral landslide, and for a party that seems to have a strong chance to achieve a new period of conservative ascendancy in American politics.",1984-08-26T05:00:00+0000

After-tax corporate profits pointed to slower growth, rising only 1.5 percent in the second quarter - substantially less than the 6.7 percent increase in the first three months of the year. And the Government adjusted second-quarter real gross national product a notch higher to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent.

According to a recent Rand Corporation study, the most able teachers are leaving, while ''fewer academically able young people'' are being hired.",1984-08-28T05:00:00+0000
