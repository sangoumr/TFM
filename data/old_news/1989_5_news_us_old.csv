His collections of short stories (''Greasy Lake and Other Stories,'' ''Descent of Man'') have also tended to pivot around the strange and the surreal: neighboring survivalists, holed up in the wilderness to await the apocalypse, come to blows; a group of hippies watches television and smokes marijuana as the skies begin to rain blood; a rowdy gang of teen-agers discovers a bloated corpse in the neighborhood lake.",1989-05-02T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 Soviet scholar ties Russian Army to Kabul Coup A6 In Beijing, an enthusiastic crowd of more than 100,000 workers and students forced its way through police cordons in the capital to demand more democracy. A8 Hope for a common Western position on short-range nuclear missiles was expressed by President Bush. But he did not indicate any change in his opposition to negotiations. A7 Because of new Soviet policies, a co-author of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment witholding trade benefits until Moscow allowed for free emigration urged that the amendment be waived. A6 Strugglers against tyranny gathered in Washington to discuss a revolution that was extending democracy through Latin America, Eastern Europe and China. A5 The U.S. will impose sanctions on countries that use chemical weapons and on companies that assist in the production of such weapons, the Bush Administration said. A3 In Senegal, menace lingers after strife A3 Israeli border police opened fire without restraint when they killed five Palestinians last month, before trying to subdue demonstrators, an investigation concluded. A10 In Britain's North Sea oil fields, a pair of production shutdowns in the past few weeks are the latest in a series of incidents that began last summer. D1 National A12-25, A36 Oliver L. North was convicted of shredding documents and two other crimes, but he was acquitted of nine other charges from his role in the Iran-contra affair. A1 Mysteries of the Iran-contra affair remained unsolved in the trial of Oliver L. North. But the case tossed off some tantalizing new leads about the role of George Bush. A1 After 12 days together, the 12 jurors said an emotional prayer that one juror said was the turning point in deciding the North case. A19 News analysis: Ollie-mania faded from the public mind by the time the verdict was finally handed up. Oliver L. North was not the shining patriot he once seemed. A18 The space shuttle rocketed into orbit as the astronauts aboard prepared to send a radar-mapping spacecraft on a journey to Venus. A1 To keep developing a Marine aircraft for another five months, the Pentagon is considering diverting millions of dollars even though Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to kill the project on Oct. 1. A1 Jim Wright received at least $22,000 from a $100,000 investment in a Texas nursing home business at a time when the company was in financial trouble. A1 Inquiry asked on Los Angeles Mayor's stock deals A12 California's car insurance rates, the third highest of any state's, may be in for drastic reductions as a result of a state Supreme Court decision that upheld a voter referendum imposing the cuts. A1 Four commodity exchanges are being investigated in New York; dozens of subpoenas were served. Federal postal inspectors searched two offices. D1 Dr. C. Everett Koop is resigning as Surgeon General after nearly eight years of surprising both liberals and conservatives with his stands on smoking, AIDS and abortion.

B1 A Staten Islander who was paroled recently was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl and may be charged in similar attacks on two other women in Manhattan. B1 A battle is raging in Hoboken, N.J., for the soul of the old seaport gone chic. On one side are residents; the other side is the Mayor. B1 Smuggling of illegal immigrants bound for Chinese sections of New York City is the charge faced by six people arrested by the authorities. Some were arrested in Toronto. B3 Criticism of the child-welfare agency was echoed by a report commissioned by the agency itself. The report found sloppy procedures within New York City's Child Welfare Administration. B1 Problems of the foster-care system are made worse when child-welfare workers permit monitoring procedures that are ''absolutely shocking,'' a Family Court judge said.B2 New York State's public universities have yet to achieve the reputation enjoyed by large universities in other states, a point that is emerging in the tuition debate.

''The Rainbow,'' adapted from Lawrence's 1915 novel, comes saddled with all the author's strengths and flaws - heavy symbolism, a feel for the land in the mortal grip of industrialization, swift turns of emotion, high-blown speeches about how men and women might love while remaining independent.",1989-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Long Trail of the Iran-Contra Case,"Aug. 4, 1981: Maj. Oliver L. North of the Marine Corps is assigned to the White House with the National Security Council. December 1981: President Reagan signs a ''finding'' authorizing a covert Central Intelligence Agency operation to support the Nicaraguan rebels. December 1982: Congress passes the first of several Boland Amendments barring use of Federal money to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua. 1984: Colonel North is assigned by security council superiors as the White House link to the contras. October 1984: Congress passes a stricter version of the Boland Amendment, cutting off all military aid to the contras. The ban held until October 1986. February 1985: Using dummy corporations abroad, Lieutenant Colonel North and two associates, Richard V. Secord, a former Air Force major general, and Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born arms dealer and businessman who is now an American, make the first of six arms purchases for the contras. Money comes from private contributors and a secret $32 million contribution by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Colonel North and his associates eventually spend $16.5 million for military aid for the contras. Mr. Hakim, Mr. Secord and a third associate, Thomas C. Clines, retain $4.4 million in commissions. 1985: Press accounts link Colonel North to a private network supplying military aid to the contras, promping Congressional letters of inquiry. Colonel North helps prepare answers denying any involvement but later admits the denials were false. July 1985: Israeli Government officials tell Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, that Iran wants to open a ''political discourse'' with the United States, an overture that leads to the first shipment of American arms to Iran and to the release of one of the seven American hostages held by terrorists. July 1985: Mr. Secord agrees to begin an airlift to supply the contras. Nov. 19, 1985: Mr. McFarlane assigns Colonel North to handle logistics for a second shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. He turns to Mr. Secord for assistance. The North-Secord-Hakim network ferrying arms to the contras also acts as the agent for future secret shipments of American arms to Iran. April 4, 1986: Colonel North outlines a plan to divert $12 million in profits from the Iran arms sales to the contras. The memorandum is prepared for Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, who succeeded Mr. McFarlane as the National Security Council adviser, to relay to the President. Admiral Poindexter later testifies that he never showed President Reagan the memo. May 25, 1986: Mr. McFarlane, Colonel North and other American officials fly to Teheran with spare parts for Iran's Hawk antiaircraft missiles. They meet for four days with Iranian officials, but fail to win the release of all the American hostages. Aug. 6, 1986: Colonel North meets with 11 members of the House Intelligence Committee and denies raising money for the contras or offering them military advice. Colonel North later testifies that he lied in this session. Nov. 3-6, 1986: Press accounts say Washington sent arms to Iran. Nov. 12-19, 1986: Colonel North and other White House officials prepare inaccurate chronologies of events in the Iran affair to deal with any repercussions that might arise. Nov. 21, 1986: Colonel North is told that Justice Department officials will inspect his files the next day, and he begins shredding documents. Nov. 22, 1986: Justice Department officials discover in Colonel North's office an April 1986 memo to the President mentioning the diversion of money to the contras. Nov. 24, 1986: Attorney General Edwin C. Meese 3d goes to the White House and tells the President of the diversion of funds. Nov. 25, 1986: Mr. Meese announces the diversion. The President announces the resignation of Admiral Poindexter and the dismissal of Colonel North. Feb. 26, 1987: A Presidential commission, headed by former Senator John G. Tower to study the operations of the National Security Council, concludes that the President's top advisers were responsible for creating the chaos that led to the Iran-contra Affair. The report asserts that Mr. Reagan Reagan was largely out of touch with operations by the council staff. July 7, 1987: Under a grant of limited immunity, Colonel North begins six days of televised testimony before Congressional committees investigating the Iran-contra affair. He says he has no idea whether the President knew of the diversion of funds. He also says that the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, approved the diversion and that the sales were originally intended as an exchange for the hostages. Nov. 18, 1987: The Congressional Iran-contra committees, which heard more than 250 hours of testimony from 28 public witnesses, concludes Mr. Reagan failed to live up to his constitutional mandate to ''take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' The committees say he bore ''the ultimate responsibility'' for wrongdoing by his aides. It finds Mr. North to have been the point man in a ''cabal of zealots.'' March 16, 1988: Colonel North, Admiral Poindexter, Mr. Secord and Mr. Hakim are indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the Government by illegally providing the contras with funds from the sale of American weapons to Iran. March 18, 1988: Colonel North resigns from the Marine Corps and says he might subpoena the Government's ''highest-ranking officials'' to defend himself. Nov. 21, 1988: Federal District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell says he will grant Mr. North's lawyers ''wide latitude'' to cross-examine Government witnesses about ''involvement in sensitive matters.'' Nov. 30, 1988: The White House announces that it intends to stop the release of secret documents Mr. North wants to use in his defense. Dec. 12, 1988: Judge Gesell gives defense lawyers until Jan. 3 to select 300 classified documents for public disclosure in the trial. Dec. 30, 1988: President Reagan and Vice President George Bush are subpoenaed to testify as defense witnesses; Judge Gesell later refuses to enforce the subpoenas. Jan. 5, 1989: Lawrence M. Walsh, the special counsel, asks the court to dismiss two important charges against Mr. North because of problems over the use of classified documents, after earlier dropping two lesser charges, leaving 12 criminal counts against him. Feb. 21, 1989: Main stage of Mr. North's trial opens after 11 months of delays and pretrial maneuvering. April 6-13, 1989: Mr. North begins six days of testimony. April 20, 1989: After reading final instructions for two hours, Judge Gesell sends case to the jury. May 4, 1989: Jury convicts Mr. North of three counts, obstructing Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity and acquits him of the other nine charges.",1989-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Simulated pearls are fine, but if your budget allows, cultured ones will make a more enduring gift. These are grown in oysters after the insertion of beads, causing the oyster to cover the bead with coats of nacre. There is no industry standard, but Mikimoto, one of the largest distributors, and other dealers grade pearls in descending order as AAA, AA, and A. An 18-inch strand of 6-millimeter pearls at Mikimoto ranges from $710 to $2,300. Here are some characteristics of pearls. Luster: Also referred to as brilliance. The longer the pearl remains in the oyster, the more nacre builds up and the deeper the radiance. Shape: Perfectly round pearls command the highest price. Odd-shaped pearls are called baroque and are less expensive. Color: Color produced by Japanese oysters is basically white, with varying shades of cream, gray, blue, gold, silver, pink and pink rose. Pink pearls are the most expensive, followed by white. Large blemishes decrease value. Source: Yoshi Watanabe, vice president, the Mikimoto America Company, New York.",1989-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 News analysis: Missile policy, especially President Bush's hard line on short-range missiles, dominates conversation in Washington and in capitals abroad, among those who follow foreign affairs. 6 Bush nominee calls treaty on strategic arms a priority 3 Soviet troops used a second toxic gas in a fatal clash with demonstrators in the Republic of Georgia last month. The second gas was a powerful tear gas that raised international concern during the Vietnam War. 1 In Afghanistan, devastation goes beyond what Westerners have previously known about the conflict. Dozens of ancient villages have been bombed, rocketed and shelled into oblivion. 1 An Iranian leader urged Palestinians to kill Westerners wherever they found them, attack American interests worldwide and hijack airplanes to obtain their rights from Israel. 3 Chinese newspapers displayed new openness in their coverage of a large demonstration on Thursday, after studiously ignoring pro-democracy protests for the last two weeks. 4 Britain expelled three South African diplomats in retaliation for Pretoria's involvement in a weapons deal with a paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. 3 South Africa rejects a U.N. proposal on Namibia 4 Western nations and Japan will help developing nations comply with a worldwide ban on certain chemicals that are destroying the protective layer of ozone in the atmosphere. 6 National 7-9, 28 Job growth slackened decisively in April, while the unemployment rate rose three-tenths of a point to 5.2 percent, the Government reported. The data confirms a weakening of the economy over several weeks. 1 Jobless rate up in New York and New Jersey 8 Jurors saw North as a scapegoat and several said they felt the defendant was blamed unfairly for following his superiors' instructions. That is why they voted to acquit him on nine of the charges. 1 George Bush's spokesman skirted questions about a pardon for Oliver North, who was convicted of shredding Government documents and two other crimes stemming from his role in the Iran-contra affair. 9 News groups in settlements with U.S. on North trial exhibit 9 The F.B.I. must overhaul its system for promoting Hispanic agents and those from other minority groups, a Federal judge announced. The judge said employment decisions had long been marred by discrimination. 1 Bound for Venus, the Magellan spacecraft cruised serenely far away from Earth on a course so accurate that only a few normal correction maneuvers should be required over the next 15 months of its planned journey. 7 The East could face shortages of electricity this summer because peak demand is rising so fast that it threatens to outstrip supply, according to utility experts. Brownouts and blackouts may occur on hot days. 33 Jim Wright pledged to block legislation in return for $250,000 in contributions to a political action committee, according to a savings and loan executive who testified in a Federal District Court. 8 Wright, in a speech at home, argues for his achievements 8 Dan Quayle, in a brief visit to Alaska, said the Exxon Corporation must do more than it is doing to clean up oil spilled by a tanker in Prince William Sound. Mr. Quayle was returning to Washington from a trip to Asia. 7 Governors from 10 states are angry about pollution at the government plants that make bomb material and laggard cleanup efforts. They released a strongly worded letter to the Secretary of Energy. 7 Rupert Murdoch agreed to sell his travel-related publications to Reed International, Britain's largest publishing company, for $825 million. The high price is an indication of the boom times in the travel business. 33 Regional 29-32 A police officer was shot and critically wounded by shotgun blasts during a drug-buy operation in New York City. The 26-year-old undercover officer was found on a sidewalk after entering a car to buy drugs. 29 Over 200 police officers guarded a two-block area around a demolished building three days after squatters vigorously protested its destruction. No one could enter the area without a police escort. 29 The Navy closed its investigation into the death of a Marine guard from Long Island who was fatally shot in El Salvador last year. The Navy said the death was self-inflicted, but the Marine's family is not so sure. 29 Gerald Cardinale offers himself as the Republican Party's most conservative choice for governor in New Jersey. But what seems to distinguish him most from the others is that his campaign is the angriest. 29 The Jersey City races are oddly dull as the campaigns for mayor and nine Council seats near Election Day on Tuesday. Elections used to mean excitement and street theater in the city. 30 Voter turnout was 6 percent Tuesday in New York City's school board elections. Fewer people voted than in any school board election since decentralized school operations began in 1970. 31 Two men accused in one rape in Brooklyn were charged with raping another woman on a nearby roof in March. The charges were filed after a 39-year-old woman saw the men's faces on a television news report. 31 The Central Park rape victim continues to improve 31 The Mayor and union leaders agreed on a plan that would save New York City $150 million a year in pension costs and avoid the layoffs of city employees in the coming year. 30 Borough chiefs on Council: plan attracts little support 31",1989-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Changing a View,"Liberals were wary and conservatives were elated when C. Everett Koop, an opponent of abortion, became the Surgeon General of the United States in 1981. Last week, some liberals probably moaned and some conservatives no doubt sighed with relief when he announced that he would resign in July. The 72-year-old pediatrician led attacks against smoking and the AIDS epidemic. His stands at times were surprising, like his statement that there was no conclusive evidence that abortions harmed women. Dr. Koop gave no reason for resigning, but friends said he was angered that President Bush had not asked him to stay beyond the end of his current term in November. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, called him ''a voice of honesty, integrity, compassion and plain good sense.''",1989-05-07T05:00:00+0000

King Richard the tyrant, the arrogant ruler of Chicago, the enemy of the masses - or so the national image of Richard J. Daley was often cast. Why then, it might have been asked, did so many people vote for him? In ''Legend,'' a highly readable, insider account of the man some described as ''America's most powerful and controversial urban official,'' Daley's press secretary Frank Sullivan explains how the former Mayor of Chicago understood the people and how they understood him. ''He talked to real people, not intellectuals or moralists,'' Mr. Sullivan writes. ''He cut through the distancing layers of political rhetoric which separate most elected officials from their constituents. Daley was the essence of all the people who live on the side streets of any great city and he spoke to these people directly.'' A populist, a loyalist and an autocrat - a politician who never entered a television studio - Daley ran the city in a manner that will likely never be repeated by his successors, including his son Richard M. Daley, who was elected last month. Mr. Sullivan paints a favorable but not cheerleading portrait of the last of the big-city bosses. The Mayor's admirers and detractors alike can find plenty of ammunition in this book to justify their claims. Mr. Sullivan defends Daley, who died in 1976, against charges that he was a racist or an anti-Semite, but notes that the Mayor had no blacks and only one Jew in his inner circle of advisers. But there is little question about how Daley felt toward reporters. Mr. Sullivan, a former reporter for The Chicago Sun-Times who says he had not always voted for Daley - until he came on the payroll - recalls the enmity the boss held for journalists. ''There is nothing more immoral than a newspaper man,'' Daley once said to Mr. Sullivan. ''You ought to know, Frank, you were one of them.''",1989-05-07T05:00:00+0000

(Vincent Canby) The Lair of the White Worm 1988. Vestron Video. 1:23. $89.98. LD (Image), $39.95. R. Suggestions of snakiness are everywhere in Ken Russell's tongue-in-cheek horror tale, loosely based on the Bram Stoker novel, of a huge legendary white serpent and present-day snakepersons who are very much caught up with the idea. ''Slither in,'' says one, himself secretly a reptile. With ''at least as much potential to give offense as some of the director's more frenzied efforts, [ the film ] also has a welcome element of droll humor.'' (Janet Maslin) Full Moon in Blue Water 1988. Media Home Entertainment. 1:26. $89.95. LD (Image), $39.95. R. A number of talented actors try to get in touch with their characters' feelings in this comedy-drama set in Texas. Floyd (Gene Hackman) wrestles with the mysterious disappearance of his wife; Louise (Terri Garr) loves Floyd despite his preoccupation with his missing spouse; the General (Burgess Meredith) is the local eccentric that every film about life in a Southern town feels it must have. ''The most interesting character is Floyd's missing wife, who, though mourned, is never explained.'' (Canby) Madame Sousatzka 1988. MCA Home Video. 2:01. $89.95. LD (Image), $39.98. PG-13. Shirley MacLaine plays a ''magnificent relic'' of a piano teacher shepherding a hand-picked group of prodigies in this film by John Schlesinger. ''Festooned with fringed shawls and clanking beads, spraying herself furiously with perfume when she becomes flustered, and made up garishly as the very essence of faded glory, Miss MacLaine rivets the attention at every turn.'' (Maslin) The Iron Triangle 1988. International Video Entertainment. 1:24. $89.95. LD (Image), $39.95. R. The Viet Cong are freedom fighters and Haing S. Ngor, who won an Oscar for his role in ''The Killing Fields,'' is a fair-minded North Vietnamese officer in Eric Weston's film about the other guys' side of the war. As a U.S. Army captain who is taken prisoner, Beau Bridges gives a solid performance, but though the film ''means to inform as well as entertain, its main problem is that it is clumsily written and directed.'' (Canby) Mr. and Mrs. Smith 1941. Turner Home Entertainment. 1:25. $19.98. LD (Image), $39.95. Alfred Hitchcock had his own way with comedy, too, even this mountain of nonsense about a marital contretemps starring Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery. ''When Mr. and Mrs. Smith try to recapture an ardent courtship in a half-forgotten spaghetti tavern,'' wrote one reviewer in 1941, ''the director sets a most sinister cat on the table to stare at the soup.''",1989-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"BANANA DIPLOMACY: The Making of American Policy in Nicaragua, 1981-1987, by Roy Gutman. (Touch-stone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) Step by step, a Newsday correspondent traces the decisions that led to the United States' entanglement with the Sandinistas and the contras. Last year our reviewer, Linda Robinson, said the book is ''superb journalism, asking the right questions and making crucial distinctions - rare qualities in this polarized debate.'' CHILDREN OF THE ARBAT, by Anatoly Rybakov. Translated by Harold Shukman. (Dell, $4.95.) DuringJU the early years of Stalin's reign, a group of young friends in Moscow's bohemian quarter learns the limits of free expression. When it was published in 1987, after two decades of suppression, this semi-autobiographical novel was called the most anti-Stalinist work ever to appear in the Soviet Union. Last year our reviewer, Irving Howe, said although the writer stays well within the officially countenanced confines of dissent, for some ''this novel will come as a revelation. In its depiction of the years of terror, it is candid and strong.'' AMERICAN HIGH: The Years of Confidence, 1945-1960, by William L. O'Neill. (Free Press/Macmillan, $9.95.) A historian looks back on the Eisenhower era and decides that it wasn't really so boring after all. In 1987 The Times's Walter Goodman said the author ''gets a little Panglossian'' at moments but the book ''should set readers of a certain age to musing fondly over what it was about the postwar decade that made it the best years of so many American lives.'' THE GREENLANDERS, by Jane Smiley. (Ivy, $4.95.) For 500 years, the Norse emigrants who followed Eric the Red to Greenland built a life of prosperity, then slowly they began to disappear. ''Like a minutely detailed tapestry, 'The Greenlanders' chronicles hundreds of episodes and tributary episodes,'' our reviewer, Howard Norman, said when this historical novel was published last year. ''Given the vast template of History, it is impressive how Ms. Smiley is able to telescope certain incidents, unravel personalities in a few paragraphs, delve into a kind of folkloric metaphysics - she is a diverse and masterly writer.'' O COME YE BACK TO IRELAND: Our First Year in County Clare, by Niall Williams and Christine Breen. (Soho Press, $8.95.) This true story about two Irish exiles who flee Manhattan for a cottage in their native land is ''a delightful romance about what some guardians of the national reputation have called 'the Ireland that matters,' '' John P. Harrington said here in 1988. MY FIRST LOVES, by Ivan Klima. Translated by Ewald Osers. (Norton, $7.95.) In a series of four tales of love and politics, a Czechoslovak writer tells about growing up in a land under siege by Nazism, Communism and other obsessions. Last year our reviewer, Jack Sullivan, noted that none of Ivan Klima's work is published in his own country. ''This seems a peculiarly defensive kind of repression, even for a totalitarian state, for 'My First Loves' is a deeply personal book, more given over to restless fantasies about sex, death, and coming of age than to political commentary. . . . These stories carry the burning authority and desperate eloquence of a survivor.'' THE GROUNDING OF MODERN FEMINISM, by Nancy F. Cott. (Yale University, $10.95.) A historian shows that from the beginning, the feminist movement has been split between the conflicting needs of more radical career women and comparatively conservative members of the working class. The book is ''detailed, well-written, scrupulously documented,'' Nina Baym said in The Book Review last year. BINO, by A. W. Gray. (Onyx/New American Library, $3.95.) When his client is murdered, a Texas lawyer finds himself pursued by drug dealers and politicians. ''Mr. Gray writes with a pen dipped in hemlock,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''Repulsive fat cats, unscrupulous politicians and shameless hypocrites are taken for a lovely ride. So is the F.B.I.'' STEINBECK: A Life in Letters, edited by Elaine Steinbeck and Robert Wallsten. (Penguin, $14.95.) This collection of John Steinbeck's letters is ''surely his most interesting, plausibly his most memorable, and in the oddest ways arguably his best book,'' our reviewer, Saul Maloff, said in 1975. WHISTLEJACKET, by John Hawkes. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) A young fashion photographer documents the decay of a rich family with some strange ideas about horses. Last year our reviewer, Patrick McGrath, called the novel ''a brilliantly sustained reflection on surface and depth, illusion and exposure, and the construction of meaning.'' FAMILY MEMORIES: An Autobiographical Journey, by Rebecca West. Edited by Faith Evans. (Penguin, $7.95.) When these recollections about the writer Rebecca West's relatives were published last year, our reviewer, Humphrey Carpenter, said they struck him as ''little short of a miracle. It is almost entirely about grandparents, aunts and uncles, and it is one of the most absorbing memoirs I have ever read.'' THE CONGRESSMAN'S DAUGHTER, by Craig Nova. (Seymour Lawrence/Delta, $8.95.) Pregnant and unwed, teen-age Alexandra Pearson returns home and finds herself trapped into marriage by the terms of her father's will. In 1986 our reviewer, Sven Birkerts, said Craig Nova brings the story ''to a flashing finish, balancing off the requisites of plot with the resolution of his deeper concerns.''",1989-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"GOLDILOCKS. By Andrew Coburn. (Scribner's, $17.95.) Crime novels - unlike mysteries, which usually rely heavily on plot - are successful largely due to their interesting characters and their mood of psychological tension. The most effective, like those by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, create sinister worlds we don't mind visiting, but certainly wouldn't care to live in. In ''Goldilocks,'' the former crime reporter Andrew Coburn (the author of ''Off Duty'' and ''The Babysitter'') has created just such a world of small-town corruption and double-dealing. Set in New England, the novel opens as Louise Baker dumps her latest paramour, Henry Witlo, a psychotic Vietnam veteran, because her invalid, blue-blood husband has just been released from the hospital. Louise has worked her way up the ladder of criminal success by taking over an ex-boyfriend's loan-sharking business. This fragmented novel chronicles her struggles as she strives to handle an insurrection by her own henchmen (including the local chief of police), as well as a Government investigation into her criminal activities. Mr. Coburn, using a series of short takes, alternates the woes of Louise Baker with the misadventures of Henry Witlo as he sinks his hooks into the newly widowed Emma Goss, who, using an interesting form of passive resistance, gives Henry more than he bargained for, slowly turning him from victimizer to victim. Although Mr. Coburn is not quite in the class of Hammett et al., he does have a nearly flawless ear for dialogue, which makes this tautly written novel move along at a smooth and satisfying pace.",1989-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Reading this delightfully unexpected, offbeat little book is like taking a ride on the Crazy Mouse at the carnival: you never know what twists or turns it will take next. Mary-Ann Tirone Smith's third novel, ''The Port of Missing Men,'' is set in 1936; as it begins, our heroine, 15-year-old Lily Neelan, and her mother, Gertie, are on board the Normandie. Lily has just won two gold medals for diving at the Olympic Games in Berlin. Naturally, Lily is the toast of the luxury liner; for her part, Gertie is wasting no time trying to snag a rich man. Through a series of cleverly interwoven flashbacks, we learn that Lily has no father, that Gertie has been a prostitute and that one of her tricks, a down-and-out former baseball player named Johnny Q, used to baby-sit with Lily while Gertie was working. A friend of Johnny Q's, a swimming pro named Eddie G, took one look at the shy, skinny Lily and announced she was ''built to dive'' - and the two of them proceeded to train her. Meanwhile, back at the boat, Gertie gets her man, a very rich German named Albert Rexhault whose father, just like Lily's, is a missing man. Kindred spirits, Lily and Rexhault decide to trace their origins together, and the adventure begins, taking them from New York to New Haven to New Orleans and finally to a lost island off the Florida Keys. Lily meets Cary Grant, Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, falls in love, becomes a spy, lives in a brothel and, in a hilarious episode, discovers that she was named by her grandmother's parrot, Rum Keg - and that she just may be the great-granddaughter of the pirate Jean Laffite.

In this collection of adventure stories, Tim Cahill, a columnist for Outside magazine, says offhandedly that ''every once in a while, I like to flirt with some physical challenge in which the price of failure is death.'' He recounts, in much the same manner, such challenges as squeezing through barely passable openings a half-mile beneath the earth, diving off the Philippines for poisonous sea snakes and hiking Death Valley in the summer. No wolverines, though; the title ''A Wolverine Is Eating My Leg'' is a play on adventure-magazine headlines. What seems to draw him to his chosen subjects is a combination of fear and fascination with death. The closer he gets to what he calls ''Grand Terror,'' the sharper his perceptions and the tighter his writing; his article about Jonestown after the Jim Jones tragedy is one of the best in the book. Even on the way to witness a total solar eclipse in Montana, Mr. Cahill makes a detour to find the shadow of death at a lake where a man had recently drowned. In a piece on observing gorillas in Rwanda, he lingers over the murdered gorilla expert Dian Fossey's collection of photos of the dead animals. None of this is as morbid as it may sound. Mr. Cahill manages to balance a sense of peril with playfulness and tells stories that are often suspenseful, educational and fun to read. As the adventure magazines like to say, he laughs in the face of death, and we laugh along.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

In this, her third novel, Barbara Chase-Riboud takes on one of the most fascinating episodes in the history of the slave trade, the successful rebellion of a group of Africans on board the Spanish slave ship Amistad. Led by the man who would be known in America as Joseph Cinque, the intended slaves killed the captain and crew of the ship and, with no maritime knowledge, attempted to sail back to West Africa. Instead they charted a wandering course up the coast of the United States and ended up in Sag Harbor, L.I., where they were imprisoned and made to endure four years of trials (which eventually reached the Supreme Court, where the defense was led by John Quincy Adams). Ultimately the survivors of the Amistad were declared free men who had fought for their liberty and were allowed to return to Africa. Considering that this took place years before the Dred Scott decision or the Civil War, it is an extraordinary story - and Cinque is an extraordinary character. Unfortunately, Ms. Chase-Riboud renders the events and the men who lived them only sporadically interesting. In the novel's opening sections she partially succeeds in conveying the unrelenting horror of the Middle Passage, but as the story proceeds Ms. Chase-Riboud's attempts to give the story an epic feel too often result in overblown and awkward prose. The novel is also damaged by rather flat characterizations, particularly in the case of Cinque, and by an overabundance of arcane historical detail. Within the story of the Amistad mutiny, there may be a great novel. But ''Echo of Lions'' isn't it.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

The rise in the Producer Price Index matches the March increase and is well below the 1 percent monthly increases recorded early this year. Other statistics pointing to a slowing economy also helped ease inflation worries. April retail sales were up only four-tenths of a percent, about half what had been anticipated.

Fred Warshofsky has taken his tape recorder and toured the American semiconductor industry, recording the anguish of its leaders as they watch their markets relentlessly eroded by Japanese competition. He has also traveled to Japan and visited factories, universities and Government officials to paint a picture of a near-invincible rival. The image that emerges in ''The Chip War'' is of an industry that is dangling by a thread, in danger of going the way of the television and videocassette recorder industries before it. In his final chapter Mr. Warshofsky, a science writer, captures the bitter frustration of the president of a modest-sized Silicon Valley chip-making equipment company. The businessman is trying to match the investment of his Japanese competitors, with their easier access to capital and their insulation from greedy Wall Street shareholders who look no farther than the next quarter's profit-and-loss statement. Mr. Warshofsky's answer for bringing the American industry back from the brink? The Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology Institute, or Sematech, the fledging semiconductor industry research consortium, financed half by industry and half by the Government, is this country's best hope, he suggests. By imitating Japanese consortiums like the Ministry of International Trade and Industry we can match our Eastern competitors, combining American skill at technological innovation with a new-found mechanism for creating manufacturing excellence. But Sematech has gotten off to a ragged start. Its executives are squabbling and its members are complaining that it is transferring technology too slowly. Rather than creating a new bureaucracy, perhaps the answer to Japanese competition is a return to the entrepreneurial spirit that created Silicon Valley in the first place.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"CHATTERTON, by Peter Ackroyd. (Ballantine, $8.95.) Keats wrote a sonnet to Thomas Chatterton, the young and unappreciated poet who killed himself in 1770 at the age of 17. Peter Ackroyd has made him a character in a story that takes place over three centuries and the result is ''a wonderfully vivid book,'' Denis Donoghue said here last year. SOMEONE WAS HERE: Profiles in the AIDS Epidemic, by George Whitmore. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) George Whitmore, the playwright and novelist, tells three true stories about victims of the AIDS virus. One is about a gay couple in Greenwich Village, one is about a Mexican-American mother who goes to San Francisco to bring her son home to Colorado to die, and one is about a hospital in the Bronx that treats infected drug addicts and their families. ''At their best, these snapshots give us crisp, sharp, well-focused glimpses of an almost impossibly large tragedy and help us begin to understand the disease,'' Stephen S. Hall said here last year. Mr. Whitmore died of AIDS on April 19. He was 43. MAMA DAY, by Gloria Naylor. (Vintage Contemporaries, $8.95.) On an isolated island off the coast of Georgia, a black matriarch named Mama Day exercises her magical powers. ''Gloria Naylor has written a big, strong, dense, admirable novel; spacious, sometimes a little drafty like all public monuments, designed to last and intended for many levels of use,'' Bharati Mukherjee said in The Book Review last year. THE LAST INTELLECTUALS: American Culture in the Age of Academe, by Russell Jacoby. (Noonday/ Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $9.95.) What, Russell Jacoby asks, ever happened to the likes of Edmund Wilson, Lewis Mumford and Malcolm Cowley? Instead of a new generation of versatile public intellectuals, we have specialists more interested in tenure and academic politics than in speaking to our cultural woes. Last year The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called this book narrow but absorbing. DALVA, by Jim Harrison. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $7.95.) In search of her lost illegitimate son, a middle-aged white woman leaves California for Nebraska and the land of the Sioux. ''The people in 'Dalva' emerge as full-blooded individuals, who almost incidentally embody much of the innocence, carelessness and urgency that played so large a part in the settling of this country,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. ''Best of all, perhaps, are Mr. Harrison's descriptions of the land - the untamed deserts, plains, forests and arroyos of what was once the Western frontier.'' She said it is his best book since LEGENDS OF THE FALL, a collection of three novellas about revenge, which is being republished by Seymour Lawrence/Delta ($8.95). Delta is also reissuing four of Jim Harrison's novels, WOLF: A False Memoir, WARLOCK, A GOOD DAY TO DIE and FARMER, as well as his SELECTED AND NEW POEMS ($8.95 each). THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM: A Year in the Life of America's Oldest Zoo, by John Sedgwick. (Fawcett, $4.95.) For the good part of a year John Sedgwick observed the curious interactions between people and animals at the Philadelphia Zoo. Last year our reviewer, Harriet Ritvo, said the book is engaging and contains a ''wealth of fascinating anecdotes.'' AFTER DELORES, by Sarah Schulman. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) When her would-be lover Punkette, a go-go dancer in New Jersey, is murdered, the waitress who stars in this novel seeks the killer among the lesbian subculture of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Last year our reviewer, Kinky Friedman, said ''the book is as raw as fresh-shucked oysters and redolent with ragged charm. . . . Ms. Schulman writes with a stumbling grace, and she looks at the world from a fragile, refreshingly jaded angle.'' THE PRESENT AGE: Progress and Anarchy in Modern America, by Robert Nisbet. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) The author believes that if the Founding Fathers were alive today they would be appalled by rampant militarism, big government and our decaying, materialistic culture. Robert Nisbet's arguments are forceful and eloquent but sometimes overstated, Richard Caplan said here last year. ''E'' IS FOR EVIDENCE, by Sue Grafton. (Bantam, $3.95.) Kinsey Millhone, the female sleuth in Sue Grafton's novel (there are four others, including '' 'D' Is for Deadbeat''), is framed when she investigates a fire in the Southern California town where she works as a private eye. This is ''the best detective fiction I have read in years,'' Vincent Patrick said in The Book Review in 1988. ELIA KAZAN: A Life, by Elia Kazan. (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.) Among the director Elia Kazan's movies are ''On the Waterfront,'' ''Viva Zapata,'' ''East of Eden'' and ''Splendor in the Grass.'' In this autobiography, which includes the story of his decision to name names before Senator Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, is ''an indispensable account of American theater and film in our time and the impassioned testament of an artist who has done his valiant best to tell the truth about himself,'' Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said here last year. DOMESTIC REVOLUTIONS: A Social History of American Family Life, by Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg. (Free Press, $11.95.) Americans have bemoaned the decline of the family for three and a half centuries, but there is no sign that this resilient institution is going to fade away. ''In 'Domestic Revolutions' we see, in fresh detail, just how the family has adapted to the stress of unprecedented change and how it has endured,'' Glenn Collins said here in 1988.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

Tricia, abandoned by her teen-age mother at a mission hospital in India, has been raised by adoptive parents in suburban Connecticut. Now, at the age of 20, she has returned to her native land, hoping to find Mamta, the mysterious tribal woman who she believes is her mother. In the process, she hopes to learn something about her own identity as well. Among the people she meets is Gautam, an angry young Indian trying to solve his own dual identity problems by abandoning Christianity for an idiosyncratic brand of communism. Mamta, the focus of their search, is an elusive, fascinating figure, a victim but also a proud survivor of the cruelest poverty. And it is her presence that unifies this skillfully plotted novel, with its rich variety of characters and voices. Mamta comes to life gradually, recalled in sorrow by the missionaries who cared for her, evoked with longing by the Indian man who loved her. When Tricia finally arrives at Mamta's ramshackle village, she finds she must learn to communicate with this woman in ways that transcend their two cultures. Stephen Alter, an American who has spent almost all his life in India, is at his best when evoking the mystery and complexity of that country. Though he sometimes makes the American missionaries too good to be true, he renders the singular world of the Indian Christian community with absolute authority. There is no colonial or neo-colonial condescension to be found in ''The Godchild,'' his third novel. Stephen Alter's vision is both unsparingly realistic and compassionate. He is a sensitive observer with an unusual ability to see a foreign culture from the inside out, making its people alive and compelling to Western readers.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

us,RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Josquin: 'L'homme arme' Masses The Tallis Scholars. Gimell CDGIM 019; CD and cassette. Every century or two a composer comes along whose music seems to transcend creative struggle completely. Bach and Mozart were such composers, and so was Josquin Des Pres, the great Flemish contrapuntalist. Though written around 1500, Josquin's two masses based on the chanson ''L'homme arme'' (and included together on a single, generous CD for the first time) contain the kind of elevated structural trickery (the tune sung forward and backward, against itself at different speeds and in various canons) that brings one to mind of both the Serialists and Minimalists of our century. But what is astonishing is how effortlessly and inevitably all the parts can mesh into moments of stunning beauty or rise to ecstatic heights. The Tallis Scholars can be a touch tame for such extravagantly expressive music, but the high voices are particularly lovely and the ensemble does very well when Josquin wants rapture. -Mark Swed Gounod: 'Faust' Marcel Journet, Cesar Vezzani. Conducted by Henri Busser. Legendary Recordings 1012; CD only; distributed by Koch Import Service. This fabled 1931 complete Paris Opera performance, now digitally remastered from 78 rpm pressings, is easily the most important ''Faust'' on compact disk because it is the most idiomatically French: Just listen to the way the singers wrap themselves vocally around the language. Even at 64, Marcel Journet - who made his debut when Gounod was still alive - sings Mephistopheles with a suave elegance that has vanished from most modern interpretations of the role. Vezzani's heroic Faust is equally striking, and Mireille Berthon's Marguerite is stylish. There are few cuts, and the quality of the early electrical sound is a surprise. -Barrymore L. Scherer Leyla Gencer: Arias from 10 Italian Operas With various orchestras. Nuova Era 2266-67; two CD's only. While Renata Tebaldi and Maria Callas pursued their international careers, their somewhat younger Turkish-born (in 1928) contemporary, Leyla Gencer, was acclaimed in Italy in a remarkable range of lyric and dramatic roles. Ten of these are represented in this set, embracing the years 1957-68. The early recordings reveal a Callas-like intensity of expression and a sovereign technical command. In the later years, the intonation becomes less dependable and the register separations more noticeable, but Gencer still comes across as a heart-rending Norma and an exciting Maria Stuarda. The audio quality ranges from barely acceptable to surprisingly good. -George Jellinek Mussorgsky: 'Pictures at an Exhibition'; Scriabin's 'Black Mass' Sonata (Op. 58), Balakirev Sonata in B flat minor Ronald Smith, piano. Nimbus NI 5187; CD only This generously packed collection of Russian works is not without drawbacks that, in the end, make it a marginal choice. Nimbus's resonant sound, effective on its orchestral disks, makes for muddy textures here, and within that haze Mr. Smith is not always as fastidious as one would hope. The ''Pictures'' reading itself is painted in faint watercolors rather than vivid oils. The Scriabin and Balakirev are more vividly played. -Allan Kozinn Schumann: The Four Symphonies The Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi. Nos. 1 and 2, London 421 439-2; CD and cassette. Nos. 3 and 4, London 421 643-2; CD and cassette. Some 30 years ago the Cleveland Orchestra recorded the four Schumann Symphonies under George Szell in performances highly regarded at the time. These new recordings, under the orchestra's current music director, have some of the virtues of the Szell performances: lean textures, clear articulation, natural balance between the sections of the orchestra. But despite fine playing, the performances have an ordinary and faceless character with no sense of wonder or discovery. Even when Mr. Dohnanyi attempts some ''Romantic'' indulgences - slight retards at the end of some sections, for example - they sound calculated rather than spontaneous responses to the music's core. -Martin Bookspan POP/JAZZ Cyndi Lauper: ''A Night to Remember'' Epic 44318; all three formats. Anonymous vocals, songs full of submissive cliches and slapdash production make it hard to believe that ''A Night to Remember'' is a Cyndi Lauper album. Where her first album offered boisterous, eccentric intelligence and her second aimed for earnest benevolence, her third sounds like the work of a beginner cleaving to commercial formulas. Most of the songs are about romantic attraction or post-breakup loneliness, and where a pop gloss might have carried a few selections, the arrangements sound flat and unfinished. Only one song, ''Like a Cat,'' shows both spirit and verbal flair. -Jon Pareles Sarah McLachlan: 'Touch' Arista 8594; all three formats. On her debut album, the 20-year-old singer, songwriter and classical guitarist from Halifax, Nova Scotia, sings her own mystical ballads filled with vague pulsing emotions and overripe images of ''moonlight in the mist,'' ''dying swan songs,'' ''brooding storms'' and ''pristine velvet walls.'' Like the English singer-songwriter Kate Bush, who is an obvious inspiration, Ms. McLachlan sings in an ethereal soprano. Enhancing the echoey cathedrallike atmosphere are delicate textures of classical guitar, harplike keyboard, gentle whirring percussion and an occasional dusting of strings. -Stephen Holden 'ReR Records Quarterly Vol. 2 No. 3' Re 0203; LP only, available from NMDS, 500 Broadway, New York, N. Y. 10012. If the newest edition of ''ReR Records Quarterly'' says anything in its choices of underground music from around the world, it is that the underground they chose to compile is defined less by a style than by the sound of low-budget technology. Everything from bad art-rock fusion from Sweden to a funny, nonsequitur of a pop tune by the American group the Tone Dogs to Canadian John Oswald's computer-generated-and-stored two-minute sound poem all feel low-tech, gritty. And oddly, they all work together. -Peter Watrous Hadda Brooks: 'Romance in the Dark' Jukebox Lil JB-1107; LP only, available from Down Home Records, 10341 San Pablo Avenue, El Cerrito, Calif. 94530 In a typical story, Ms. Brooks, after studying classical music for most of her childhood, went into pop music in the 40's. Not knowing much about it, she went into boogie woogie, and came out with a career as a blues and boogie pianist. Not knowing much about singing, she went into it and came out with a career as a soaked-in-whisky singer of ballads. Together, her playing and singing made her famous, at least for a time, and ''Romance in the Dark,'' with its boogie versions of ''Hungarian Rhapsody,'' and ''Minuet in G,'' contrasting against rocking boogies and standards, give a view of both the commercial ideas of the time and the work of an unfairly forgotten pianist. -P. W. Joe Jackson: 'Blaze of Glory' A&M 5249; all three formats. As both a composer and a lyricist, Joe Jackson has a comprehensive sensibility that reaches out to encompass as much of the world as he can gather in. ''Blaze of Glory,'' his most sweeping album to date, offers a rough chronological history of his generation's feelings about love, politics and fashion, all filtered through a somewhat acerbic personal viewpoint. The inspirations for the album's 12 songs run from space travel to rock-and-roll mythology to television to aerobics. The songs trace an emotional path, from idealism to anger to tempered affirmation. While Mr. Jackson's edgy singing can't express the entire emotional range of the songs, the music is an interesting agglomeration of rock, Latin American, semiclassical and other textures translated by Mr. Jackson into a jangling personal style. -S.

The gay teen-age boys who populate this short, brutal novel are not entirely indistinguishable from one another, but their energetic couplings betray a fatal sameness that is only occasionally relieved by the homicidal fetishes of their older lovers. Some readers have found similarities between the novelist and art critic Dennis Cooper's work and that of Jean Genet or William Burroughs, but it must be said that he lacks the ordering instincts of the one and the wild comedy of the other. Indeed, Mr. Cooper's offerings seem to have more in common with run-of-the-mill pornography, particularly its grinding obsessiveness and fantastic lack of material consequences. In ''Closer,'' a novel whose action occurs in the mid-1980's and whose characters constitute a rather large circle of ever-shifting sexual partners, it's curious that the nightmare of AIDS is nowhere mentioned. Personal style, it seems, is the sole determinant of destiny (''He would have been nothing without punk''; ''His room was so dazzling it made the rest of the world seem as dull as a parking lot''), and human emotion is a continuing mystery (one boy reports experiencing something that might have been love, except that it ''was too manageable and kind of coldly interesting''). Certain of Dennis Cooper's people, particularly the older men, find their interests moving toward snuff movies, coprophilia and erotically inspired disembowelments; yet even their less dramatic activities are so gratuitous, so random and formless, that everything seems to gravitate naturally toward death.",1989-05-14T05:00:00+0000

[ Page A1. ] INTERNATIONAL REPORT Soviet-American trade prospects are brightening as business contacts increase and President Bush leans toward easing a law that imposes stiff tariffs on Soviet imports. [ D1. ] East German growth may be grinding to a near halt, after serving as a symbol that a Communist economy can be highly productive. German leaders have flatly rejected the market-oriented reforms that are gaining favor in some Communist countries.

There are latex (water base) floor paints, and most dry to a semigloss rather than a high gloss finish. As for the caulking, I'm afraid nothing will hold up long, as no caulking materials are made to be walked on. However, latex caulks stay more flexible than oil based caulks, so you might try one of these (test in a small section first).",1989-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Breaking Away,"As temperatures rise, bicyclists by the thousands take to the streets and parks of the city and the back roads of the countryside. Before you join them, it is a good idea to have your bicycle overhauled by a qualified mechanic. A thorough job by a bikeshop can cost anywhere from $45 to $75 or more for a 12- or 18-speed. If possible, bring your bicycle in during the week - when the shop is less busy and more likely to pay closer attention to both you and your machine. Here are some key repairs: Brakes: Adjust for quick, smooth response by tightening cables; replace old, worn brake shoes Brake and Gear Cables: Replace frayed cables; repack cables with fresh grease; replace worn cable housings Hubs, Bottom Bracket and Head Set: Clean and repack with fresh grease once a year; replace ball bearings if necessary Chain: Clean; replace if necessary (especially if rusted); replace freewheel when replacing chain Wheels and Tires: Wheels should be true (round without any side-to-side wobble); spokes should be tight; rims should have no bulges; tires should be properly inflated.

Emerging from partial amnesia, a Canadian novelist realizes that as a child she developed an alternate personality to repress the fact that she had a sexual relationship with her father. Sylvia Fraser has written ''a case history that doubles as literature,'' Jill Johnston said here last year. ''But it's something more as well - a fast-moving detective story in which the author uncovers her own past as victim.'' THE WOMAN WARRIOR: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts, by Maxine Hong Kingston. (Vintage International, $6.95.) Before ''Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book,'' her recent novel about a Chinese-AmericanJU playwright who tries through his art to make sense of his strange cross-cultural experiences, Maxine Hong Kingston wrote two surrealistic memoirs that seem to blur the line between fact and fiction. In ''The Woman Warrior,'' she writes of her childhood ''with bitter and relentless love,'' Jane Kramer said in The Book Review in 1976. ''Her voice . . . is as fierce as a warrior's voice, and as eloquent as any artist's.'' Vintage International has also reissued CHINA MEN ($7.95), in which she tells the story of Chinese immigrants laboring in the alien land called America. In 1980 Mary Gordon called it ''a triumph of the highest order of imagination, of language, of moral perception.'' ELEPHANT MEMORIES: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family, by Cynthia Moss. (Fawcett Columbine, $10.95.) A denizen of Kenya's Amboseli National Park tells what she has learned from her life in a community of elephants. ''However much one may resist at the start, one is soon swept away by this 'Babar' for adults,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ''By the end, one even begins to feel an aversion for people. One wants to curse human civilization and cry out, 'Now God stand up for elephants!' '' CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE, by Rodney Hall. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $7.95.) Isolated on a farm called Paradise, an Australian family descends into a pathological life of brutality and violence. The novel ''is as grim and harrowing and beautiful as the wilderness it evokes, a raw spiritual landscape that brings to mind Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner,'' Joyce Reiser Kornblatt said here last year. ''This is a book that makes demands on the reader's soul.'' SPIRIT SEIZURES, by Melissa Pritchard. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) It is appropriate that this collection of stories about the physically and spiritually afflicted won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction, Elizabeth Tallent said in The Book Review in 1987. ''Melissa Pritchard treats odd, cruel dilemmas with dispassion, and as if by some fictional law the absence of overt charity toward deprived or crippled characters produces in the reader a sense of their memorably unmediated presence on the page.'' ELLEN TERRY: Player in Her Time, by Nina Auerbach. (Norton, $10.95.) Trapped by her society's notions of what a woman should be like, the British actress Ellen Terry had to play as many roles off stage as on. In 1987 our reviewer, Margot Peters, said Nina Auerbach ''brings her considerable skills of analysis, scholarship and persuasion'' to ''a richly colored, challenging and often illuminating piece of work.'' COME SUNDAY, by Bradford Morrow. (Collier/Macmillan, $10.95.) An expert on longevity is offered the opportunity to meet a 500-year-old Spanish conquistador who walked away from his own beheading. Last year our reviewer, Lawrence Thornton, said that he had mixed feelings about this novel, but that it was written ''with considerable panache and virtuosity.'' SEASON OF GLORY, by Ralph Houk and Robert W. Creamer. (Pocket, $4.50.) Sharing the stage with the veteran baseball writer Robert W. Creamer, the manager who took over the job from Casey Stengel tells about the 1961 Yankee team, which most baseball fans consider one of the Yankees' two best. Last year our reviewer, Diane Cole, said the book ''overflows with vintage baseball lore - the kooky stories, cagey insights and esoteric statistics that no fan can resist.'' In SIXTY-ONE: The Team, the Record, the Men (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $9.95), Tony Kubek, who was the Yankees' starting shortstop, and Terry Pluto, the coeditor of ''A Baseball Winter,'' tell their version of the story. ''Peppered with anecdotes (like the time Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle put pine tar in Mr. Ford's deodorant - which Yogi Berra had the annoying habit of borrowing), this is an insider's view: lively, entertaining and, perhaps best of all, nostalgic,'' Charles Salzberg said here in 1987. BLOOD SHOT, by Sara Paretsky. (Dell, $4.50.) On a visit back to her dying old neighborhood in south Chicago, V. I. Warshawski uncovers a chemical company's crime against the environment. Sara Paretsky ''does her best and boldest work to date in creating a criminal investigation that is a genuine heroic quest,'' Marilyn Stasio said here in 1988. LAST LETTERS: Prisons and Prisoners of the French Revolution 1793-1794, by Olivier Blanc. Translated by Alan Sheridan. (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $9.95.) On a search through the French National Archives, the author came across letters home from prisoners condemned to death during the Terror. He ''asks us to look at the victims, and to approach them as individuals, without any intervening theory,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1987. ''The result is both moving and full of interest.''",1989-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Suddenly their fondness for painting, now in acrylics on canvas, is landing them squarely in the lap of the international art world, for which they are adapting their grand creation myths, maps of the land and ceremonial symbols to the West's easel- painting tradition. Once, the rectangular format of Western painting was totally foreign to the aborigines.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"Everybody's All American 1988. Warner Home Video. 2 hours, 7 minutes. $89.95. Laser disk, $29.95. Closed captioned. R. Over a period of 25 years a Louisiana football hero named Gavin Grey (Dennis Quaid) gradually goes from the top of the heap to over the hill while his wife, Babs (Jessica Lange), blossoms from Magnolia Queen into a strong woman with plenty of grit behind her Dixie sweetness. Miss Lange gives a ''stellar performance,'' both breathlessly sexual and touchingly authentic. Mr. Quaid establishes himself as an actor of ''real weight and mutability.'' The film, by the director Taylor Hackford, matches his ''Officer and a Gentleman'' in the ''sharpness of its sense of place, the sureness of its storytelling momentum and the larger-than-life performances of its stars.'' (Janet Maslin) Coming to America 1988. Paramount Home Video. 1:56. No price suggested. LD, $24.95. CC. R. As Prince Zamunda, an African prince who travels to New York to find a wife, Eddie Murphy tries his hand at what is supposed to be a romantic comedy but is more often a series of in-and-out comic gags set amid hookers and hustlers in Queens. Arsenio Hall, as the prince's friend Semmi, performs some amusing cameos, and James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair, as the Zamunda's regal parents, ''display comic authority that is not evident in the rest of the film . It's possible that [ John ] Landis, the director of what is still Mr. Murphy's best comedy, 'Trading Places,' couldn't care less about consistency.'' (Vincent Canby) Another Woman 1988. Orion Home Video. 1:21. $89.98. LD (Orion/Image Entertainment), $39.95. CC. PG. Woody Allen's film concerns Marion, a beautiful and respected professor of philosophy (Gena Rowlands) who has just turned 50 and is feeling much in need of self-reassessment. Something's missing. Children, for one thing. Passion, for another. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of stuffily successful Upper West Siders who talk too elaborately and way too much. What's also missing is Mr. Allen, who takes no role. He ''is becoming an immensely sophisticated director, but this screenplay is in need of a merciless literary editing.'' Still, the film is his ''most personal and self-searching . . . utterly serious and from both the head and the heart.'' (Canby) Burning Secret 1988. Vestron Video. 1:47. $89.98. LD (Image), $39.95. PG. It's 1919 and 12-year-old Edmund (David Eberts), asthmatic and sheltered, journeys to Switzerland for treatment with his beautiful, proper mother, Sonya (Faye Dunaway). There they encounter the Baron (Klaus Maria Brandauer), suitably cynical and charming, who captivates the boy and seduces his mother. The Baron, one of the war's bitter walking wounded, is a ''fully conceived character . . . When playing a genteel lady, [ Ms. Dunaway ] becomes very actressy.''

us,'THE WORLD HAS CHANGED ON US',"Cray Research Inc., the nation's biggest maker of supercomputers, announced last week that it would split into two companies. After the announcement, its chairman, John A. Rollwagen, met with reporters and editors of The New York Times to discuss the future of supercomputing and how this development affects it. Question: There has been a lot of attention on supercomputers recently. Is Cray a national resource? Mr. Rollwagen: Yes. Certainly we are perceived that way. Q. If so, what should President Bush do to help Cray? Mr. Rollwagen: First, recognize that we are in a critical period in the industry in the U.S. To have an industry you need at least two thriving, profitable companies. He has to recognize that splitting into two means a certain period of vulnerability for both companies. The best way to support those efforts is to buy from both. That could really accelerate the development of both. Q. Is that all? Mr. Rollwagen: No. Second, he has to recognize that these two companies are competing on a global scale and that they have tough competition from Japan. They need help doing more business in Japan. And he has to look at export control policy, and not just for supercomputers, but in general. He needs to ask: ''What should our policy be on technology exchange?'' Q. Are export controls a problem? Mr. Rollwagen: Yes, every time we want to sell outside this country. Obviously, some countries are more sensitive than others. The world has changed on us and we have to recognize that. Q. What has changed? Mr. Rollwagen: The value added in a product now comes from the design, the technology, the information. That changes the nature of the transaction. For instance, it does not cost a whole lot to build a Cray computer. So why do we charge so much? The value is in the design, the information. Q. How does the exchange of high technology affect trade? Mr. Rollwagen: If I sell you a supercomputer, I am selling you information and at the end of the day, I have your money and I still have my information. That sounds like a good deal, but it is actually a bad one for me. Sure you do not have your money anymore, but you have my information and your information as well. Now you have a tremendous competitive advantage over me. So the best transaction is to trade information. Q. You have talked about relations with Japan. Are national boundaries becoming less important? Mr. Rollwagen: They are certainly becoming blurred. Fujitsu is a key supplier of ours, but Fujitsu in Japan is our key competitor. It is ridiculous to think of Japan or the United States totally creaming the other. If we fight to the death and one wins, we both lose. That might be better recognized here than there. But we have a lot to gain by working together. Q. Often when we ask a company about American competitiveness, we get a puzzled response. They say, ''We think about being globally competitive,'' as if they've moved past the notion of identifying their fate with the national fate. Mr. Rollwagen: If you ask about Cray Research, yes, we are a global competitor. We will get our parts and people where we can. We don't think of ourselves in that sense as a U.S. company. However, the world is not perfect, either. It is very clear in Japan that we are not able to compete on the same footing as our Japanese competitors. Q. Would you ever consider allowing one of the big Japanese computer companies to take a 10 or 15 percent interest in Cray Research? Mr. Rollwagen: We would not seek it out, but we would not get terribly upset if it happened. It depends on their intentions. If they got close to a controlling interest, then you would get worried. You would have to ask what their intention is. If Fujitsu bought us to shut us down, it would not be a good deal. Q. But what if they bought you in order that you all prosper? Are you such a national resource that the nation, as a matter of public policy, could not sit still for foreign ownership of Cray? Mr. Rollwagen: Let's turn it around. Say Fujitsu bought us and said they were going to make us prosper. What are they really thinking about? At a minimum, access to technology to build into products made in Japan, maybe insist on using all Fujitsu parts in new computers. If they were totally passive shareholders who owned the company, obviously that does not make any difference. It is not enough to say, ''What if they bought 10 or 15 percent?'' We have to know what the next step would be. Q. How do trade issues figure in this? Mr. Rollwagen: We have to look at the business on a global basis. But on the other hand, if you looked at it from Washington's viewpoint, it is clear there are countries and borders and they have a role.",1989-05-21T05:00:00+0000

J. Foyt. The field average of 216.588 miles an hour smashed the Indianapolis record of 210.280 m.p.h. set in 1986. Rutherford was bumped from the lineup by Rich Vogler with fewer than 15 minutes remaining. But Foyt put Rutherford into a Cosworth-powered Lola and got the car onto the oval one minute before the scheduled close. Rutherford's crew said his warm-up lap was more than 217 m.p.h., well above what he needed to get back into the field. But less than 100 yards after taking the green flag for the start of a 4-lap, 10-mile qualifying run, smoke poured from the engine. It was the second year in a row that Vogler has been the final qualifier, bumping a former Indy winner.

So far, there have been two, both in Arizona; a third is scheduled for June 23 and 24, in Scottsdale. A fourth, with prizes totaling $7,000, is to be held in Tucson in August. According to Balaianu, foot tennis is already played professionally in Hungary, and informally, without standardized rules, in soccer-playing nations worldwide. By the dictates of his new federation, the game is to be played on a regulation doubles tennis court with either three or four players on a side, who use their heads, shoulders, knees or feet to bat the ball back and forth across the net. A serve, with the feet, must bounce in either service box. Returns may be volleyed or allowed to bounce once, each team having a maximum three hits to keep the ball in play.

A physicist shows that understanding light can lead to an appreciation of every level of the universe, from atoms to animals to stars. The author ''is a popularizer in the best sense, the expert witness clearly and concisely explaining complex concepts,'' James Cornell said here in 1987. ''He makes points with conviction and considerable grace, and highlights his straightforward narrative with some fascinating insights.'' THE SUGAR MOTHER, by Elizabeth Jolley. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) When Cecilia, his barrenJU obstetrician wife, goes off on sabbatical, an introverted professor named Edwin Page finds that his neighbor and her beautiful daughter, Leila, want to move in. This is Elizabeth Jolley's ''warmest novel, her most moving and possibly the best introduction to her fiction,'' Stephen McCauley said here last year. '' 'The Sugar Mother' gently lures the reader into Ms. Jolley's world. The eccentric (often delightful, sometimes nightmarish) extremes of her other novels are relatively muted here. But beware of the book's seductive charm.'' THE ADAMS WOMEN: Abigail and Louisa Adams, Their Sisters and Daughters, by Paul C. Nagel. (Oxford University, $9.95.) In the Adams family, the men got to be Presidents while the women stayed home and assumed the enormous burden of putting up with them. ''In this worthy sequel to 'Descent From Glory,' his study of the Adams men, Paul C. Nagel again proves himself a shrewd psychologist and a gifted biographer,'' Jan Lewis said in The Book Review in 1987. THE TOYNBEE CONVECTOR, by Ray Bradbury. (Bantam, $3.95.) In the title piece of this collection of short stories, an inventor tries to cure the world of its cynicism by perpetrating a hoax: a time machine that brings back news of a wonderful future. ''For all the familiarity of his materials, Mr. Bradbury, in his best work, demonstrates a sure-footed storytelling talent, creating tales that boast the sort of easily accessible morals so dear to high-school teachers and that also stand up as memorable pop entertainments,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. RUSSIA AND THE NEGRO: Blacks in Russian History and Thought, by Allison Blakely. (Howard University, $12.95.) This history of how blacks have influenced Russia and vice versa includes a cast of characters ranging from Pushkin to Angela Davis. In 1987 our reviewer, William C. Fuller Jr., said the book is ''unusual and entertaining.'' It won an American Book Award in 1988. OUT ON THE MARSH, by David Updike. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) Last year our reviewer, Joyce Reiser Kornblatt, said that the best work in this first collection of short fiction by David Updike is characterized by a ''Zenlike repose.'' A HISTORY OF THEIR OWN: Volume One. Women in Europe From Prehistory to the Present, by Bonnie S. Anderson and Judith P. Zinsser. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $12.95.) Most of the history of the world has been written by men. Last year our reviewer, G. W. Bowersock, said that some of the feminist analysis in this report from the other side is too simplistic but that the book is ''an honorable initiative in giving women the history they deserve.'' NOT THAT SORT OF GIRL, by Mary Wesley. (Penguin, $6.95.) When her husband dies after half a century of marriage, Rose Peel must decide whether to take up with Mylo, who has been her sometime lover for all those years. Last year our reviewer, Julian Moynahan, said Mary Wesley ''pushes things to excess in an imaginative, sometimes idiosyncratic way.'' HOW CAN AFRICA SURVIVE? by Jennifer Seymour Whitaker. (Council on Foreign Relations, $12.95.) The best thing the West can do to help Africa solve its own problems, the author argues, is to provide support without trying to impose ideology. This is ''a clear-sighted examination of why Africa has been unable to fulfill the promises of independence and how, with luck, courage and serious planning, it may one day be able to play a meaningful role in the global community,'' David Lamb said in The Book Review last year. CAROLINA SKELETONS, by David Stout. (Mysterious Press, $4.95.) A black journalist tries to discover whether his uncle really killed two white girls 40 years ago. Based on the story of a real murder, this novel ''is full of compassion and understanding,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''It is a plea for people of different ethnic and social backgrounds to understand one another and come together.'' BUYING INTO AMERICA: How Foreign Money Is Changing the Face of Our Nation, by Martin Tolchin and Susan Tolchin. (Berkley, $4.95.) One of the unexpected effects of our laissez-faire system is that it has allowed foreigners to gain control quietly over our economic and political affairs. ''It is the Tolchins' great accomplishment that they manage to explore the benefits, costs and policy questions raised by disproportionate foreign investment without ever becoming alarmist or jingoistic, yet still persuading the reader that a real problem exists,'' Robert Kuttner said here last year. LETOURNEAU'S USED AUTO PARTS, by Carolyn Chute. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) The author of ''The Beans of Egypt, Maine,'' tells more about what it is like to live on hot dogs and baloney in a trashy trailer park from which there is no escape. ''Carolyn Chute, along with Russell Banks, Raymond Carver and a few others, shatters the myth that characters have to be Southern to be grotesque,'' Clarence Major said here last year. ''To her credit, unlike Steinbeck, Ms. Chute makes no attempt to preach a philosophy of liberation.''",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

A third mistrial was narrowly averted in Brooklyn when one of the 12 jurors whose identities were supposedly secret said that two men had threatened him in his driveway. After the juror was dismissed, the remaining 11 last week returned a guilty verdict against Mr. Gotti and an associate. Defense lawyers said they would appeal.

While Stalin favored inflated, wedding-cake-style architecture to express the state's authority, Khrushchev wanted quantity - especially mass-produced housing, roughly built with large prefabricated panels. What had been an elitist profession under Stalin became subsumed within a centrally planned, bottom-line-only bureaucracy intent on the industrialization of all building. In 1957, Khrushchev abolished the Academy of Architecture; some architecture schools closed; enrollment in others declined. Diminished responsibilities and freedoms lowered expectations and reduced the profession's ability to attract talent. Architecture was humbled and marginalized.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

The ''frivolous society'' of turn-of-the-century New York, Edith Wharton claimed in her 1905 novel ''The House of Mirth,'' ''can acquire dramatic significance only through what its frivolity destroys.'' In this volume, Louis Auchincloss - like Wharton, a novelist of manners and a scion of the patricians he chronicles - calls this the society of ''The Vanderbilt Era.'' There are several handsome group portraits among its illustrations of three generations of Vanderbilt physiognomy and architectural indulgence. But the accompanying prose amounts less to a group portrait, or even the ''profiles of a gilded age'' announced in the subtitle, than to a slight collection of biographical highlights, of which the nine-page treatment of Cornelius, the patriarch, is by far the longest. Mr. Auchincloss has a fine ear for anecdote, and his accounts are burnished with family feeling: his wife, Adele, is descended from Cornelius Vanderbilt, while his mother's uncle, Edmund C. Stanton, merits a chapter as the general manager, from 1886 to 1891, of the Metropolitan Opera House, one of William Henry Vanderbilt's projects. Of the Commodore's famous family, Mr. Auchincloss disarmingly writes, ''I chose them because they were richer and more numerous than any of the other clans that dominated business in the decades that followed the Civil War, and because they made a greater splash with their money.'' His assertion that this splash was crucial in generating the American Renaissance manifests itself in treatments of magisterial figures like Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Henry Adams and Stanford White. These, alas, reveal the sketchiness of his sketches and undermine his opportunity to offer for the Vanderbilt decades other criteria than their destructive frivolity.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

For years, women have been told that the most effective preventive medicine they could practice was getting an annual Pap smear. Yet here, suddenly, were women like Barbara Arbuckle of Seattle, telling a Congressional hearing that, even after two of these tests had indicated she was fine, she really harbored a fast-growing cancer. The woman, who had no children, was forced to have a hysterectomy at age 23.

us,FICTION,"THE ICE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD. By Mark Richard. (Knopf, $16.95.) Abandoned children, bereaved lovers, victims of flood and other devastations - these are the characters who inhabit Mark Richard's first collection of short stories. Set somewhere in the South in bleak landscapes that mirror the futile existence of those who live there, the stories depict a world wracked by emotional, economic or natural disaster. Though their lives have been whittled down by harsh circumstances, most of Mr. Richard's characters can claim one victory: they are survivors. It is what they survive on - sharp, insightful humor; friendships that sustain betrayal; the games and fantasies that distract children from the vagaries of their elders - that is most intriguing. The stories about children are especially convincing. ''This Is Us, Excellent,'' for example, is an account of domestic violence, told in the breathless language of a tough little boy whose life tumbles chaotically from his own rough games to his father's brutal beatings, which in turn are followed by riotous family outings to amusement parks and restaurants. Skillfully handled, the kaleidoscopic contrast is chilling. Unfortunately, other stories that have more elliptical themes, including the title piece (a contemplation of marriage and other bonds), are weak in comparison. This is due, in part, to Mr. Richard's style. His attempts to duplicate colloquial language sometimes seem self-conscious and contrived, and they slow the reader down. However, the best stories in this collection tell, in an authentic, clear voice, the ways in which adversity strips character and relationships down to their most rudimentary and durable elements.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

We know that athletes are able to reach the zone with simple stimulus-response patterns, such as the snapping of one's fingers. Just as aromas proliferating from a bakery may trigger profound memories of Mom's apple pie, so too can stimuli be used to elicit powerful and specific past experiences in sport. For example, Denise Parker, the Olympic archer, might use the simple action of taking an arrow out of her quiver as the stimulus - or anchor - that enables her to attain the zone. This anchor (or optimal performance state) comes about through the continued association of the stimulus with the zone state. The more frequently the anchor is activated, the more automatic the response becomes.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

us,GUESSING GAMES,"Someone once asked Harry Waugh, the grand old man of the English wine trade, how long it had been since he'd mistaken a Bordeaux wine for a Burgundy. ''How long is it since lunch?'' he replied. No single part of wine lore is more beset by myth and misinformation than the vague area of wine tasting. Fiction is filled with stories about legendary feats of wine detection. At some climactic point, while the rest of the characters hold their breath and the tension is almost painful, the hero, brow furrowed and eyes closed in concentration, swirls his glass a bit and says: ''I may be wrong, but I'd say this is a '64 Bordeaux and, because it's a bit light, it was probably one of the chateaux that picked during the awful rain that year. Because of the water, there isn't much body, but the structure is there and the elegance one finds only in Pauillac. I'd say it's the 1964 Chateau Pontet-Canet.'' And, of course, it is. In the story, anyway. Bordeaux wine people play these games from time to time, but only among themselves, because they know the reality of wine tasting. One can pull off astonishing feats of detective work one day and not recognize one's own wine the next.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

Even a really horrible theatrical movie will be advertised for a couple of weeks or so and is more noticeable than ''Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure'' on ABC last Sunday or ''Out on the Edge'' (CBS, May 14).

If you haven't been paying attention to them, you probably think that a lot of people are getting sick and dying in TV movies. That's the general perception, but in reality only certain people are dying. Kids are dying. Women are getting extremely ill, being diagnosed as terminal, defying expectations and bouncing back.

A bunch of medicalschool types gang up on her and accuse her of practicing medicine without a license. Much moral ground is covered.

us,FICTION,"EMILY L. By Marguerite Duras. Translated by Barbara Bray. (Pantheon, $15.95.) Marguerite Duras, the Goncourt Prize-winning author of many novels, including ''The Lover,'' again combines her gifts for the literary and visual arts in this arresting novella. In a French quayside cafe in late summer, the French narrator, accompanied by the man with whom she's been having an affair that is ''taking forever to die,'' grows absorbed by a British couple sitting nearby. Impelled by an inescapable fear that is her ''main point of reference,'' the narrator, a writer, projects onto the wan Englishwoman a life history that seems inextricably tied to her own. The Englishwoman, the narrator imagines, has been with the British captain all her adult life; in fact, he was her first lover. But, as is often the case with Miss Duras, love is accompanied by destruction. The woman, whom the narrator calls ''Emily L.,'' had written poems in her youth, poems that years later win high praise; the captain, however, is unable to understand them (or the part of her that needs to create) and destroys the most important one, the poem-in-progress that would have cast light on the ''internal difference where the meanings are.'' The poem remains unfinished, the couple remains together, the woman remains unfulfilled. Barbara Bray's restrained translation never obtrudes on the precision and spareness of Miss Duras's prose, the deadly accurate realism juxtaposed against the surrealism. With a depth that shines through the minimalist surface of her story, Miss Duras raises probing questions about love, art, fear and haunting sadness.",1989-05-28T05:00:00+0000

Thousands of machine-gun-carrying soldiers were packed in the backs of trucks fitted with swing-type machine guns, which I always thought were for shooting down airplanes. The soldiers were kicking the Tibetans and hitting them with their rifles. What had started as a peaceful protest was deliberately escalated into a bloodbath.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Bach: ''Magnificat'' (S. 243); Vivaldi: ''Gloria'' (R. 589) Dawn Upshaw, Penelope Jensen, Marietta Simpson, David Gordon, William Stone and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Chorus conducted by Robert Shaw. Telarc CD-80194, CD only. The unsurpassed smoothness of these performances may surprise listeners accustomed to the lean, accented style of presenting Baroque music currently in favor. Both works are exceptionally rich in beautiful melodies, and certainly lend themselves to Mr. Shaw's uncomplicated, pervasively musical treatment. The many solo arias and duets are so handsomely sung by the soloists that stylistic questions subordinate themselves to sheer musical enjoyment. By allowing Bach and Vivaldi to speak for themselves without distortion, Mr. Shaw's excellently recorded versions have earned their place in the enormous discography of both works. -Paul Turok Brahms and Ligeti: Trios for Violin, Horn and Piano Bridge BCD 9012; CD only. There is a small but notable tradition of composing works to ''go with'' existing masterpieces for unusual combinations of instruments. The trio of Gyorgy Ligeti recorded here falls more frankly into that category than most; it is openly subtitled ''Hommage a Brahms,'' and puts the idiomatic horn-call motives of Brahms's Op. 40 through various transformations. It is hard to hear it as much more than an appendage, gloss, recollection or commentary - but it is one that engages the attention. William Purvis's first-rate horn playing links the works; he has ''new music'' collaborators (Rolf Schulte and Alan Feinberg) for the Ligeti and ''standard rep'' collaborators (Daniel Phillips and Richard Goode) for the Brahms, an intent but somewhat sluggish performance. -Will Crutchfield Haydn: Symphonies Nos. 26, 52 and 53 La Petite Bande; Sigiswald Kuijken, conductor; Virgin Classics VC 7 90743; CD and cassette. Haydn's symphonies before the familiar clutch of late masterpieces are full of gems still undiscovered by all but specialists, and these scores most definitely fall into the gem category. Whatever one may feel about Beethoven on original instruments, there can be no doubt that Haydn benefits from the clarity of texture and pungency of timbre of groups like the 25-member Petite Bande. And Mr. Kuijken's interpretations sound particularly buoyant and rhythmically alive. -John Rockwell New Computer Music. Works by Paul Lansky, Curtis Roads, James Dashow, Clarence Barlow, Stephan Kaske, Michel Waisvisz Wergo 2010-50; CD only. The six works in this collection of 1980's electronic music show different ways of manipulating the genre's increasingly sophisticated gadgetry. Paul Lansky, for instance, makes interesting textures and rhythms out of the unintelligible, computer-generated voices in ''Idle Chatter.'' Curtis Roads's ''Nscor'' and James Dashow's ''Sequence Symbols'' are of the more traditional bleep and buzz school, but unfold with a sense of drama and direction. Clarence Barlow's ''Relationships'' is for all intents and purposes a jazz-rock work, for synthesizer bass and drums. -Allan Kozinn Havergail Brian: Symphony No. 3 BBC Symphony Orchestra, Lionel Friend, conductor. Hyperion CDA66334; CD only. The English composer Havergail Brian (1876-1972) was a legend during his lifetime, if only for the indomitable self-confidence that allowed him to compose 32 symphonies (among other works) in the face of nearly total neglect. Toward the end of his life, there was a modest surge of interest in his music. The Third Symphony, dating from 1932, is a monumentally conceived work that easily accommodates two pianos into its immense orchestral fabric. It is Malherian in scope, Elgarian in sound and has a ruggedness particular to its composer. The performance is powerful, the recording superb. -P. T. POP/JAZZ Buster Poindexter: 'Buster Goes Berserk' RCA 9660; all three formats. No rock-and-roller generates a more infectious sense of fun than Buster Poindexter. On his second album, as on his debut, the best cuts are those that suggest scenes from a wild party in progress where the host is the rambunctious, half-pickled singer, who has immersed himself in the persona of a funky soul man. The performances of soul standards (''Hit the Road, Jack'') and obscure soul novelties (''International Playboy''), and of original funky novelties (''DeBourge Yourself'') are uproarious turns full of fun and personality. But when Mr. Poindexter turns introspective for the Frank Sinatra standard ''Deep in a Dream,'' his personality becomes dull, his singing merely crude. -Stephen Holden Loudon Wainwright III: 'Therapy' Silvertone 1203; all three formats. During his nearly 20-year recording career, Mr. Wainwright has accumulated a body of brutally candid comic songs that has almost become a folk genre unto itself. The chemistry between Mr. Wainwright's simple good-timey melodies, his cheerfully acidic singing and his cathartically confessional light verses can elicit laughter at things one usually sheds tears over. In recent years, Mr. Wainwright's humor has darkened. Beneath the smart-aleck tone one senses a profound bemusement. The cast of characters in ''Therapy'' includes ex-wives, children, aging parents and other folk singers. Much of the writing is first-rate, and the confessions cut more deeply than ever. Consider this the latest absorbing chapter in a lifelong oeuvre. - S. H. Darling Buds: 'Pop Said . . . ' Columbia 45208; all three formats. A decade after the Go-Go's and Blondie, Great Britain is enjoying a miniwave of guitar-charged, pop-centered girl groups, among them Voice of the Beehive, the Primitives and now the Darling Buds, from South Wales. Yet where their cohorts undercut old girl-group attitudes, the Darling Buds proceed without irony. In most of their songs, by Andrea Lewis (vocals) and Harley Farr (guitar), the singer lives for romance and awaits absent boyfriends' whims; only ''Shame on You'' takes a 1980's twist. But as the guitars surge and the catchy choruses pile up, the Darling Buds supply unrepentant pop pleasure. -Jon Pareles Bill Frisell: 'Before We Were Born' Elektra-Musician 60843; all three formats. Bill Frisell is a master of the amorphous guitar sound - eerie sustained melodies, floating tones that seem to peek in from another time-space continuum, splotches and spatters of distortion. While he has worked with jazz's structural experimenters, his own albums have been relatively conventional - until now. ''Before We Were Born'' includes ''Hard Plains Drifter,'' a series of country-tinged tunes and abstract interludes shredded and patched together by John Zorn; ''Some Song and Dance,'' a string of bop-flavored tunes with a saxophone section, and ''The Lone Ranger,'' a slow-building dream-waltz. By following through on the implications of his unfettered sounds, Mr. Frisell has made his best album. -J. P. Djivan Gasparian: 'I Will Not Be Sad in This World' Opal/Warner Bros. 25885; all three formats. From absolute stillness comes a sound that floats, croons, quivers as it carries an ancient melody - the sound of Djivan Gasparian playing the Armenian duduk, a double-reed instrument with a rich, doleful, flutelike tone. On ''I Will Not Be Sad,'' a collection of folk melodies recorded in 1983, Mr. Gasparian is accompanied only by a second duduk carrying a quiet, steady drone. As with the Bulgarian choirs on ''Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares,'' the silence of the studio brings out every sustained nuance of inflection, and the songs are almost heartbreaking in their eerie slow motion. -J.

Thirty years ago last week, Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates pitched one of baseball's masterpieces, working 12 perfect innings, retiring 36 batters in a row, but, incredibly, losing the game in 13 innings to the Milwaukee Braves. Counting his game before that one, how many straight batters did Haddix retire over the two games and is that a major league record? A. Before Haddix set down 36 batters in a row, the left-hander had knocked off the last two batters in his previous start, on May 21, 1959, so the perfect effort versus the Braves on May 26 gave him 38 in a row, which stood as the major league mark for 13 years. Then in 1972, Jim Barr, a right-hander with the San Francisco Giants, won consecutive shutouts against Pittsburgh (8-0) on Aug. 23 and St. Louis (3-0) on Aug. 29, and in doing so, retired the last 21 Pirate batters he faced and the first 20 Cardinal batters.

us,East-West Friction: The NATO Years,"March 1946 Winston Churchill, the leader of Britain's Conservative opposition, warns of Soviet expansionism in his Iron Curtain speech at Fulton, Mo. With President Truman present, he calls for the United States and Britain to unite as guardians of the peace. March 1947 The Truman Doctrine begins with economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey, initiating the policy of containment. February 1948 Stalin completes the takeover of Eastern Europe as the Communists gain control in Czechoslovakia. June 1948 Stalin blockades West Berlin; the Allies respond with the Berlin airlift. April 4, 1949 The United States, Canada and 10 European countries form NATO; Greece and Turkey join in 1952 and Spain in 1980. May 6, 1955 West Germany joins NATO. May 14, 1955 The Soviet Union signs the Warsaw Treaty with its East European allies. 1966 President Charles de Gaulle removes French forces from the alliance's command structure and asks NATO units to leave France. 1979 NATO decides to deploy cruise and Pershing 2 nuclear missiles in Europe but to seek talks on reducing such intermediate-range forces in Europe. 1983 Despite major antinuclear protests, deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces begins in Britain, West Germany and Italy under the 1979 agreement. 1985 President Reagan starts his Strategic Defense Initiative, known as ''Star Wars.'' December 1987 Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and President Reagan sign an agreement to eliminate their land-based intermediate-range nuclear arms in Europe, leaving French and British weapons in place. Giving their consent, NATO allies suggest further superpower talks about conventional forces and short-range, or battlefield, nuclear arms. March 1988 Mr. Gorbachev, in Yugoslavia, calls for an integrated Europe with fewer weapons and more economic coherence. December 1988 Mr. Gorbachev, at the United Nations, asks for basic changes in relations between the superpowers. He announces cuts in Soviet military strength and phased withdrawals from Eastern Europe. April 1989 Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany demands prompt superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons, most of them in Germany and under American control. May 1989 Mr. Gorbachev surprises Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d by announcing the removal of 500 short-range nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe and detailed proposals on conventional forces.",1989-05-29T05:00:00+0000
