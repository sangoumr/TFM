us,Dining Out Guide: New Jersey,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in the New Jersey Weekly section of The New York Times. Ratings are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. The Brass Rail Very Good (March 12, 1989), 135 Washington Street, Hoboken (201-659-7074) - The restaurant, behind etched-glass doors that mute the sounds of the pub downstairs, has the luxurious style of a French dining salon. This is accomplished with extravagant bouquets, red velvet banquettes and painted cherubs on the ceiling. A new menu for summer is in the works; for now one can still order the recommended lobster bisque and seafood salad served with a raspberry vinaigrette. Entrees of note include medallions of veal with chanterelles and shelled lobster in puff pastry in a rich shellfish sauce. Petal-thin cookies, layered with cream and strawberries, make a delicious mille-feuille dessert. Appetizers are $7.50 to $17.50, entrees $18.50 to $24.50. Dinner from 6 to 10 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Hamilton's Grill Very Good (Jan. 1, 1989), 8 1/2 Coryell Street, Lambertville (609-397-4343) -A charming courtyard is the scene of this year-old restaurant near the Delaware River in Hunterdon County. An open grill and adobe oven dominate the front room, while the back dining area presents a conversation piece with its large, gilt-framed ceiling mirror surrounded by a celestial mural. Most of the salads and shellfish appetizers can be recommended. Crisp-crusted pizzas include one with shrimp, pesto and cheese. Seafood is a strong suit at Hamilton's, and flash-grilled and lightly charred salmon fillet is a standout. Other good choices are the roast chicken, grilled lobster and, for dessert, the lime tart. There is no liquor license, but patrons may bring their own wine or beer. Appetizers are $4 to $60 (for 3.3 ounces of caviar), entrees $6.95 to $30. Open 6 to 10 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday and 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. for Sunday brunch. Margaux Very Good (Jan. 22, 1989), Route 34 South, Colts Neck (201-431-7594) - A provincial French style lends atmosphere to this casual restaurant in an area known for its scenic horse farms. A wood-burning grill is used to cook several dishes on the summer menu. One is an appetizer called grilled shrimp cocktail; marinated goat cheese with olives, and a salad of dandelion greens and radishes in a walnut vinaigrette are other seasonal starters. Entrees include grilled chicken breast (marinated in tequila and lime); soft-shell crabs with smoked salmon and bacon butter, and ''London broil'' of American lamb. Appetizers are $3.50 to $9, entrees $13.50 to $22.50. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5 to 10 P.M. Monday to Thursday, 5 to 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday, 5 to 9 P.M. Sunday. Patrice Very Good (Oct. 23, 1988), 555 Passaic Avenue, West Caldwell (201-808-0555) - Contemporary eclectic cuisine is served in a serene dining room designed in tones of pale green and sandstone. Hand-painted marbled columns and service pieces and graceful architecural details belie the location upstairs in a shopping center. A small terrace has been opened for outdoor dining. Appetizers on the new menu include calamari and scallops with eggplant and red-pepper coulis and crab cakes with red-pepper mayonnaise. Among the entrees are grilled tuna given a Japanese twist with ponzu, wasabi and pickled ginger; black sea bass with tangerine and basil sauce, and grilled loin of lamb with mint pesto. The pastry chef creates, among other desserts, a peach shortcake. Appetizers are $4 to $12, entrees $15 to $26. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5:30 to 9:30 P.M.

But in more recent years, he has also managed other musicians and restarted some careers, including that of the pianist Gene Harris (who led the group called the Three Sounds in the 1960's and is now the pianist in the Brown trio), and Jeff Hamilton, a former drummer with Woody Herman and now the third member of the Brown trio.

us,Mike Schmidt and the Good Now Days,"He was batting .203 with six homers, but when his glove also betrayed him, Mike Schmidt knew it was time. With two on and two out in a 3-3 game in San Francisco a week ago, the Phillies' third baseman booted a grounder for what would have been the third out, a grounder he would have once handled routinely. When the next hitter, Will Clark, smashed a grand-slam homer, the Phillies were on their way to an 8-5 loss. And at age 39, Mike Schmidt decided that he won't be playing baseball anymore. It's baseball's loss, not his. Too many baseball fans yearn for the good old days, as if nobody playing now could possibly be as good as the old-timers. But too many baseball fans don't always appreciate the good now days. Over nearly two decades, Mike Schmidt was the third baseman of the good now days. While accumulating three National League most valuable player awards, he hit 548 homers and was voted 10 Gold Gloves. No other third baseman ever did what he did with both his bat and his glove.

No longer could anyone just ''get 'em out as fast as you can'' and worry later about what to do with them in the middle game. Yet every once in a while, quantitative development seems to work. Capablanca had turned what had been considered elementary by strong players into an immensely sophisticated process involving the strategy of the whole game. His idea of qualitative development often required a slowing of the entrance of the minor pieces into the battle in favor of a delicate, positional queen move. Sometimes it was necessary to break off development for a preventive pawn move. His underlying thought was that the pieces should not just come out, but come out with some strategic aim. The eventual goal was harmonious cooperation in an attack.",1989-06-04T05:00:00+0000

It has been said that ''If Auschwitz was hell, Theresienstadt was the anteroom.'' While deprivation, disease and death were commonplace (during one period 150 people died each day), the camp, located in Czechoslovakia, was used as a showplace to persuade international organizations that the Jews were being well cared for. To perpetuate this facade prisoners were allowed, at times even encouraged, to participate in cultural activities. After brutal days of physical labor there were poetry readings, lectures on literature and philosophy, and even opera productions in the barracks. For many people art became a strategy of survival. In 1944, for example, there was a poetry competition and of the then 37,000 inmates, 3,000 submitted poems. And that was only in German. Ruth Schwertfeger, an assistant professor of German at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, has translated and edited the poetry and memoirs of Theresienstadt's women. Their writing on children, loss, death and hope are powerful documents - certainly nothing that the Nazis planned for when they sponsored poetry contests. The worst fear of life in Theresienstadt was transport to the east, which meant Auschwitz. Ilse Blumenthal-Weiss wrote of the farewell from her husband, ''And now without you I go towards you / And bear your death across a wide world.'' In her poem ''Resonance,'' another survivor, Gerty Spies, writes eloquently of living with her memories: ''The chains lie now / At my feet and I am free / But now I know / How heavy freedom weighs on me.''",1989-06-04T05:00:00+0000

On the water, a few wisps of morning sea smoke drift in raggedly from Fundy Bay; they'll soon burn off as daylight stirs the crisp night air. Vaguely, this June morning, one can make out the glint of white lobster boats heading out from nearby island villages to tend their traps. Nearer to shore, other boats are bobbing silently around the herring weirs - Indian fishing mazes spun from cedar poles and kelp-tattered netting. St. Andrews, about three hours north of Bar Harbor and minutes past Maine's easternmost coastal border, lies at the heart of the Maritimes, deep in a baffle of islands and coves known as the Fundy Tidal Region.",1989-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Kim Basinger, in a role that is ''as winningly played as [ it ] is annoyingly written,'' is Celeste, an alien sent to Earth to sweet-talk a scientist (Dan Aykroyd) out of secrets that will save her planet. This entails sleeping with and cooking for the fellow, which seems hardly worth the effort with Mr. Aykroyd, ''who isn't the least bit funny . . . in this role, nor remotely suited to play a romantic lead.'' Miss Basinger ''ought to be more than enough to make the film interesting. But, unfortunately, she's not alone.'' (Janet Maslin) The Prisoner 1955. RCA/Columbia. 1:31. $69.95. Not rated. Charged with treason, Alec Guinness, as a character based on Hungary's Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty, is psychically pulled apart by a skillful state interrogator (Jack Hawkins) in a film that, in the words of a reviewer in 1955, says much ''about the character and dignity - or lack of dignity - of men who live under the rule of political tyrants.'' Mr. Guinness, in a role of ''tremendous intellectual complexity,'' performs with ''such clarity and feeling that it strikes the very marrow of your bones.'' Random Harvest 1942. MGM/UA. 2:08. $29.95.

Butterfield 8 1960. MGM/UA. 1:49. $29.95. Not rated. Elizabeth Taylor won the Academy award as a pricey call girl in Daniel Mann's film derived from the novel by John O'Hara. ''I was the slut of all time,'' Gloria Wandorous (Miss Taylor) tells her mother (Mildred Dunnock) at one point.

Furthermore, Harvard was spending $13,000 to redesign its football field and Yale planned to acquire property near its campus and build a new field of its own.

us,NONFICTION,"OUT OF THE BLUE. By Orel Hershiser with Jerry B. Jenkins. (Wolgemuth & Hyatt, $17.95.) In 1988, Orel Hershiser had a dream season. Though there is no such thing as a two-man baseball team, the Los Angeles Dodgers came close with Kirk Gibson's bat and Mr. Hershiser's incredible arm - he won 23 games and pitched 59 consecutive scoreless innings, breaking Don Drysdale's record of 58Z. As a result, an only slightly better than mediocre Dodgers team managed to wrest the National League crown from the Mets, then proceeded to swipe the World Series rings right off the fingers of the favored Oakland A's. With the help of the sports biographer Jerry B. Jenkins, Mr. Hershiser has produced one of those quickie books that hit the shelves just months after the season ends. Usually these books, dictated in the heat of the moment, are superficial rehashes of the season meant primarily for die-hard hometown fans. Alas, for the most part, this is the case with ''Out of the Blue.'' In the first half of the book Mr. Hershiser, a modest man who insists ''I'm proof that great things can happen to ordinary people if they work hard and never give up,'' gives the reader a fascinating look at what it takes to become a major-league pitcher - and it takes a lot more than those of us who have never stepped to the mound can imagine - as well as a brief notion of what makes Orel Hershiser, a deeply religious Christian, tick. However, the second half is little more than a lackluster synopsis of the season, sadly lacking in insight. If you are a Mets or A's fan, this is somewhat akin to listening to your dentist give a postoperative blow-by-blow description of your root canal.",1989-06-04T05:00:00+0000

The Catskill Mountains are full of myth and mystery in this striking first novel, which takes us beyond the region's resorts, ski slopes and second homes and into the life of Margaret Becker. A single mother who ''just about always cleaned houses for a livin','' Margaret tells her story in the unvarnished vernacular of the farmers and laborers who make up her world. These are people rubbed raw by poverty, but they seem burnished, not dulled, by it. As she struggles to make a life after the death of her 3-year-old son, Margaret can't help connecting - at times, quite mystically - with the stark landscape and with the women and children who become her adopted family. Men are not at the center of this clan. It is the women, by turns stoic and sensual, who heal, nourish and, when necessary, banish the ghosts of past griefs. Margaret's own preternatural power is that she can ''switch over,'' can enter the blood and brain of other creatures and see events through their eyes. That is the author's power, too. The themes in ''Same Blood'' may be familiar, but in Mermer Blakeslee's capable hands, the story - of loss and renewal - is fresh.",1989-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Ratings are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Chez Noelle Excellent (Oct. 9, 1988), 34 Willowdale Avenue, Port Washington (516-883-3191) - A street of lumberyards and auto-body shops in a modest corner of Port Washington yields one of the Island's best restaurants. Chez Noelle has a classic decor with white linen tablecloths, candlelight and a handsome Art Deco service bar. Dishes are carefully cooked and sauced, and the presentation is Japanese inspired. Appetizers include langoustine mousse and frog-leg ravioli with watercress sauce. Among the entrees are rack of lamb Provencal (prepared with garlic, herbs and fresh tomatoes); poached salmon with basil sauce, or breast of free-range chicken. Appetizers are $4 to $7.50, entrees $15 to $25. Dinner 6 to 9:30 P.M. on Sunday and Tuesday to Thursday, 6 to 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Monday. La Estancia Very Good (Jan. 22, 1989), 481 Hempstead Turnpike, a half-mile east of Belmont Race Track, Elmont (516-328-8481) - Serious eating means steak to many Argentines, and this authentic restaurant specializes in beef at reasonable prices. The name means ranch, and the appropriately horsy decor includes stylized drawings of gauchos and photographs of Thoroughbreds, jockeys and trainers from the nearby race track. Pastas, made with a light hand by the owner's wife, are all recommended, as are the charcoal-grilled chicken and chicken scarpariello. The best of the beef dishes is Milanese con papas fritos, a robust relative of chicken-fried steak. Also good are filet mignon and sliced steak. Homemade peppery Argentine steak sauce adds spark to all grilled meats. Entrees are $5.50 to $15. Hours: 11:30 A.M. to 10 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11 P.M. Friday; 1 to 11 P.M. Saturday, until 10 P.M. Sunday. La Ginestra Very Good (May 14, 1989), 4 School Street, Glen Cove (516-671-3184) -Despite red roses, crisp white tablecloths and waiters in tuxedos, the atmosphere at La Ginestra is that of a Sicilian country inn. Hearty red sauces of southern Italy are here in abundance, but so are light meals featuring vegetables and meats from the wood-fired grill. Baby eggplant, sliced and lightly charred, is paired with fresh chopped tomato for a good starter. Another delightful choice is the antipasto vario.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Martinu: Cello Sonatas Steven Isserlis, cello; Peter Evans, piano. Hyperion CDA66296; CD and cassette. A surprising number of Martinu's countless works are just as appealingly fresh and cosmopolitan as are his three cello sonatas. The sonatas all contain irresistible airy melodies and swaying syncopations that make you want to wiggle in your seat, and that subtle and sometimes cocky sense of layered counterpoint that characterizes Martinu at his best. These are wonderful pieces, instantly accessible but just unusual enough to retain a sense of mystery. Steven Isserlis plays with an ingratiating lyricism, if not as much color as the music can take, and Peter Evan partners him fluently. The sound, too, is warm and inviting. -Mark Swed Barber: 'School for Scandal' Overture, Adagio for Strings, Three Essays for Orchestra and 'Medea's Dance of Vengeance' St. Louis Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leonard Slatkin. EMI 49463; CD and cassette. This collection adds luster to the record of service to American music compiled by Mr. Slatkin and his Missourians. Lyricism and introspection predominate in the six selections, which have established themselves as American classics. The pieces have a 1930's and 1940's flavor in their plain-spoken, passionate honesty. The performances are superbly disciplined yet fiery in pursuit of Barber's melancholy vision. -Andrew L. Pincus Barber: Cello Concerto; Britten: Cello Symphony Yo-Yo Ma and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra conducted by David Zinman. CBS Masterworks MK 44900; CD and cassette. This disk explores several less central branches of the cello repertory, with brilliant results. Barber's concerto is, comparatively, one of his more astringent scores. It is good company for Britten's alternately brooding and triumphantly extrovert masterpiece. Britten's accompaniment raises the orchestra to nearly equal status with the cello soloist, perhaps the reason for calling his work a symphony. In both works, the orchestral support offered by the Baltimoreans is exemplary. Add Yo-Yo Ma's masterful playing, and this release of two important but not often heard 20th-century works is irresistible. -Paul Turok Raff: Symphony No. 5 ('Lenore'), Opus 177 The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Matthias Bamert. Koch Schwann CD 311 013 H1; CD only. Joachim Raff (1822-1882) was a popular and prolific composer: among his 214 opus numbers are 6 operas and 11 symphonies. His Fifth Symphony was inspired by a German poem about a maiden whose lover, killed in war, returns as a specter; they both perish in a wild night-ride. Raff's music is structurally naive, but it does capture some of the imagery of the story, in sound reminiscent of Mendelssohn and Schumann, with suggestions of the Mahler to come. This performance, conducted by the former associate conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, is caring and sensitive. The recorded sound is lean. - Martin Bookspan Donizetti: 'La Fille du Regiment' June Anderson, soprano; Alfredo Kraus, tenor; Bruno Campanella, conductor. EMI/Angel CDMB 7 63128; two CD's only. This is a reasonably trim and spirited run-through of Donizetti's delightful score, taken from live performances in 1986 and having at times some of the advantages that come from recording in the theater rather than in the studio. While one would probably not regret an evening spent hearing these artists at the opera, there is not much that I would especially like to hear again on the record. The conducting can turn soggy in slow passages. June Anderson has a lovely voice, but sounds tired and lacks spirit, charm and style. Alfredo Kraus has preserved his voice admirably; still, I would sooner go back to the 1975 performance (in Italian, which he sings better than the French used here) issued on Legato (SRO 513-2). For sheer vocal eclat, the new set offers little competition to the Sutherland-Pavarotti classic on London. -Will Crutchfield POP/JAZZ Jackson Browne: 'World In Motion' Elektra 60830; all three formats. Mr. Browne has been groping for his political voice for almost a decade, and on ''World in Motion,'' his most compelling album since ''The Pretender,'' his leftist rhetoric and romantic folk-rock finally blend. Mr. Browne's oratorical lyrics, his hymnlike melodies, his clear, passionate singing and a production that enriches the California folk-rock sound of the 70's with expressive, pointillistic electronics combine to evoke a high-minded vision of human possibility shaded by deep alarm. Mr. Browne's finest new songs - the bluesy ''World in Motion'' and the majestic ''Anything Can Happen'' - effect a smooth fusion of the personal and the rhetorical sides of his sensibility. -Stephen Holden The Jacksons: '2300 Jackson Street' Epic 40911; all three formats. ''We're all united/ And standing strong'' goes the title song of the Jacksons' first album as a family group in five years. The lush, official-sounding state-of-the-family message is the album's only cut in which Michael participates (as a harmony voice, along with assorted Jackson relations), and the address of the title becomes a chanted leitmotif throughout the album. With various cuts supervised by such hot producers as Teddy Riley, Michael Omartian and the team of L. A and Babyface, ''2300 Jackson Street'' sounds opulent. But beneath the gloss, the songs are formulaic. -S. H. Pere Ubu: 'Cloudland' Fontana/Polygram 838273; all three formats. Longtime Pere Ubu fans should ease into ''Cloudland'' by starting with side two, the slightly unbuttoned half of the Cleveland band's most conventional album. Perhaps to prove a point, Pere Ubu has made an album of mostly straightforward rock, with clean-cut melodies, foreground vocals, neat guitar hooks and hardly any of the band's old gleeful noise. David Thomas's lyrics (now fully audible) still dispense skewed insights about everything from parking lots to the music of ice-cream trucks, and Pere Ubu can certainly knock out post-1960's garage-rock - even a gimmicky would-be single. But those who prized Pere Ubu's old anarchic genius may wonder, as one song asks, ''What are we doing here?'' -Jon Pareles Frank Allison and Odd Sox: 'Monkey Business' Relapse 802; LP and cassette only. Relapse Records, Box 611, Plymouth, Mich. 48170. A low-budget production - recorded in Frank Allison's kitchen and onstage in Ann Arbor, Mich. - perfectly suits Mr. Allison's scrappy, hard-nosed, good-humored songs about living on the fringe of an insatiable consumer economy. His car eats cash, a girlfriend is a compulsive buyer, a broke couple can't believe they own ''So Much Junk,'' and when the singer attends ''Bart's Reunion Party,'' ''they're all doing better than me.'' The tunes are steeped in guitar-driven 1960's rock - early Beatles, Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival - but the attitude is from the 1980's, at street level. >-J. P. Wayne Shorter, Eddie Gomez, Jack DeJohnette, Dave Liebman, Richie Beirach: 'Tribute to John Coltrane' Columbia 45136; all three formats. Despite the billing, on ''Tribute to John Coltrane'' the saxophonist Wayne Shorter only sat in with the saxophonist David Liebman's group on three of the album's five Coltrane compositions, recorded live in Japan - but when he does, the music levitates. In quick bursts and streaks, in brilliant sprints, in urgent outbursts and songful curves, Mr. Shorter's soprano saxophone solos break free and fly in ways his studio albums rarely capture. Mr. Liebman has hardened the Coltrane influence into a steady torrent of four-note groups, but Mr. Shorter's unfettered solos are cries of passion and exaltation. -J. P.",1989-06-11T05:00:00+0000

Like most Americans, when she picked up the telephone and punched the ''O'' button for operator assistance, she had assumed she would be dealing with A.T.&T., which would have charged $5.51 for the call.

No wonder, then, that Bartok's concerto has received dozens of recordings since its first performance on Dec. 1, 1944, by Serge Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. What is wonderful is that every so often a new recording comes along that takes a refreshing look at this familiar music. Of two recent recordings, by Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (London 421 443-2; CD only) and by Andre Previn and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (Telarc CD-80174; CD only), it is Previn's that makes the stronger impression.",1989-06-11T05:00:00+0000

It gave every appearance of having been recently scrubbed down, no doubt with Bounty paper towels and Mr. Clean. After all, if Procter & Gamble doesn't have a clean kitchen, who does? Even more exciting, however, was the reaction I elicited from the company.

By John Michael Montias. 407 pp. Princeton University, $49.50. Vermeer the artist is everyone's favorite. Vermeer the man, on the other hand, is famously inaccessible. No one knows what he looked like. Not a letter, not a diary entry, not an eyewitness account of no matter how noncommittal a kind has come down to us. For all we know, Vermeer (1632-75) had no close friends. He went nowhere (except perhaps in the horse-towed barges that linked one Dutch town to another). Unlikely as it may seem that in such a life there were no epiphanies, no inconvenient emotions, no place for pity or terror, no formative or re-formative experiences, Vermeer in human terms is a beloved blank.",1989-06-11T05:00:00+0000

At the next table, a ruddy Norwegian fumbled happily with Great Wall tour pamphlets.

The museum has observed the date in part by unveiling a handsome and discreet renovation of its sculpture garden, also 50 years old, by the architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee and the landscape architect Robert Zion. Otherwise, the anniversary passed quietly, without the hoopla that has surrounded many other milestones in this institution's life. Perhaps that is just as well, since while the great structure of 1939 designed by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone still technically exists, it is a very different building in 1989: its interior has been completely rebuilt, and only the upper stories of its facade remain more or less as they were 50 years ago. And even the facade has been overshadowed and obscured by the large additions to the museum by Philip Johnson and Cesar Pelli, additions that make the Goodwin and Stone building no longer a free-standing structure in itself but merely a single element in a much larger architectural composition.",1989-06-11T05:00:00+0000

Yet a diary kept by a 14-year-old girl hiding in an Amsterdam attic managed to capture the essence of the monstrousness.

She quickly grabbed another torch: same result. And another: again the flame went out. A standby torch was rushed in from the wings, but Brunnhilde by this time was fed up. Waving a flameless baton toward the hero's bier, she rushed to her death, no doubt glad to end it all.

Page A1 China expelled two U.S. journalists, including one from the Voice of America. The Government accused the two reporters of violating martial-law regulations in Beijing. A16 China's expulsion was protested by the Bush Administration, saying the move would not keep ''the truth about what is going on in China from being heard.'' A16 On evening television news in China, the Government has reverted to the kind of indoctrination that was familiar during the Mao years. A16 A key murder case in Mexico, the 1984 shooting of the country's best-known journalist, appears to have been cracked with the arrest of a former security official who headed the initial investigation. A1 After years of terror, Uganda has emerged as a major hope of the World Bank and the United States. The three-year-old regime has achieved an unprecedented measure of political stability. A1 Vietnam and Britain were at odds over the forced repatriation of boat people now in Hong Kong as an international conference on Indochinese refugees ended. A19 In Stuttgart, Mikhail Gorbachev was welcomed with enthusiasm that appeared to confirm a West German perception of him as an extraordinary statesman. A10 Currency devaluations in Nicaragua have sent consumers reeling and provoked new doubts about the Government's ability to control the economy in a crucial election year. A3 News analysis: Dan Quayle is emerging as a defender of the Nicaraguan ''freedom fighters,'' pressing the U.S. policy adopted in a bipartisan compromise with Congress. A3 In the Olof Palme murder trial, key prosecution witnesses have given testimony far more favorable to the defendant than expected.

A1 The largest unmanned U.S. rocket to climb into space, and the first one big enough to rival the space shuttle, was launched in Florida, marking the debut of a multibillion-dollar fleet of Titan 4's. A1 The discovery of radioactive metals at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, produced only by splitting atoms, has raised tantalizing new questions about the plant's troubled history. A1 A ''frequent shopper'' program at supermarkets would award rebates to regular buyers of certain name-brand goods. Pathmark, Giant Food and Vons will begin testing. A1 A vote on the Pentagon's package for buying weapons was called for by the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin, provoking a frenzy of lobbying and political maneuvering. B11 The victor in Virginia's primary for the Republican nominee for governor, former state Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman, plunged into the campaign. A20 A fire at the Jackson Laboratory, one of the world's leading suppliers of re- search mice, has caused major disruptions for medical scientists in the United States, Canada and other countries. A20 House Democrats failed to override the President's veto of a bill to increase the minimum wage. But the Democrats vowed to seek compromise legislation. A21 Labs that do DNA ''fingerprinting'' analyses to be used as evidence in criminal cases need a set of national reliability standards, experts in the new field say.

B1 A stormy dispute over the Tongass, the huge rain forest along western Canada, has involved Representative Robert J. Mrazek of Long Island in a peculiar mixture of bicoastal grudges and alliances.

Because adjustable rates respond slowly to interest-rate fluctuations, some homeowners could save up to $30,000 in interest payments over the life of a typical 30-year $100,000 mortgage by switching to a fixed rate. Two years ago, an adjustable rate made sense because interest rates were higher and adjustable rates offered the least-costly path to owning a home. But the buyer who borrowed $100,000 two years ago at 7.89 percent, a typical introductory rate then, might do better by converting to a fixed rate. The table shows the savings on a $100,000 mortgage at 9.98 percent, the current national fixed-rate average, as opposed to the current average adjustable rate of 11.15 percent.

For devotees of cop tales and mob lore, few situations are as tantalizing as that of the undercover police officer, who struggles to keep from becoming what he is impersonating, ever edgy that his cover will be blown, unable to confide in family or friends. Chris Anastos, of the New York City police, lived that life for nearly five years. He was such a convincing ''wiseguy,'' or mob soldier, that he wound up having Sunday dinner every week at the home of a Long Island capo - and ended up in a love affair with the man's daughter. This was no simple story, and Mr. Anastos was no simple character. When he reluctantly accepted the undercover job, he was 33 years old, happily married to a professional singer and determined to earn his gold detective's shield through buy-and-bust arrests with the narcotics squad. By the time the assignment ended, he was physically ravaged by alcohol and cigarettes, unable to sleep without lights on, a stranger to his wife and incapable of informing on the mobster who regarded him as a future son-in-law. ''Love or Honor,'' by Joan Barthel, whose previous books include ''A Death in Canaan'' and ''A Death in California,'' is told entirely from Mr. Anastos' viewpoint, with extended segments of reconstructed dialogue. It is not clear whether any names have been changed. We never learn the last name of John, the capo who took on Mr. Anastos as his chauffeur, or of Marty, John's daughter, who never discovered her lover's true identity. Mr. Anastos emerges as a tarnished hero who wins his gold shield, but loses life as he knew it. Two lives, really.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Jacek Jost, a 33-year-old chemical engineer, husband and father, hates his dull but comfortable suburban existence. He feels suffocated by his work, his marriage, even his child, and wants to escape them all, yet he can't bring himself to do it. Then one day, as he is riding home from work, his commuter train suddenly jerks to a stop and Jost is hurled into the lap of a young woman, with whom he proceeds to have an affair. So begins this hilarious and tragic novel. Originally written in 1967, it is the first work by the acclaimed Czechoslovak writer Vladimir Paral to be published in English, in a skillful if at times too literal translation by William Harkins. Jost eventually finds seven lovers, each in a different town along his train route, and spends his days traveling from one to another. Each mistress offers an alternative life, and Jost might have any of them if only he could choose. But he can't. Instead, he's trapped by his neuroses and his chronic ambivalence. Unable to take any decisive action, he tries to force others to catapult him into change - by trying to get fired, for example, or to make his wife divorce him. But his efforts are always frustrated, and usually in comic fashion. Yet ultimately ''Catapult'' is a serious book. Mr. Paral masterfully switches from farce to drama and back again, so that in the end we feel Jost's dilemma even as we're laughing at him.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE POWER GAME: How Washington Works, by Hedrick Smith. (Ballantine, $5.95.) Because of Congressional reforms, the advent of political action committees, the proliferation of lobbyists and the ever more pervasive forum provided by television, power in Washington has become fractured into hundreds of centers, each hard-pressed to garner enough influence to get things done. ''Most of this very long book is . . . an effort to explain how the new game is played,'' Alan Brinkley said here last year. ''It is knowledgeable and informative. And it is often highly entertaining, filled with enough inside information and spicy anecdotes to satisfy even the most jaded political junkie.'' BAD BEHAVIOR, by Mary Gaitskill. (Vintage, $7.95.) For the unhappy people in these matter-of-fact stories, there is nothing very remarkable about sadomasochism. The world, after all, is a painful place. Why should it be any different in bed? ''Remember the late stories of John O'Hara?'' our reviewer, George Garrett, said last year. ''How well he used the shock of sexual perversity as the central revelation? Here we go a step further. It is never revelation, just another quality in the cumulative discovery of character. Wise beyond her years, utterly unsentimental, Mary Gaitskill is at once ruthlessly objective and sympathetic.'' HAING NGOR: A Cambodian Odyssey, by Haing Ngor with Roger Warner. (Warner, $12.95.) The Cambodian doctor who played Dith Pran in the movie ''The Killing Fields'' and won an Academy Award tells how he himself suffered under the Khmer Rouge. Last year our reviewer, Rod Nordland, called this ''a book of punishing introspection. . . . This is a thoughtful, well-educated man, reduced to slavery and suffering, who never fails to bring his intelligence to bear on the events around him.'' SUCH GOOD FRIENDS, by Lois Gould. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $6.95.) As she waits loyally at her husband's deathbed, Julie Messinger discovers that his life was a marathon bout of promiscuity - and that he recorded the sordid details in a diary written in code. When Lois Gould's first novel was published in 1970, our reviewer, W. G. Rogers, called it ''witty, scintillating, peppery and fast-paced,'' though he wasn't sure readers under 18 should be admitted. Farrar, Straus & Giroux is also republishing four other Gould novels. In LA PRESIDENTA ($8.95), Rosa Andujar, a woman who seems a lot like Eva Peron, uses myth and magic to rule an imaginary Latin American land. ''Rosa Andujar is an extraordinary creation, fierce and gentle,'' Jerome Charyn said here in 1981. ''But the novel that surrounds her doesn't have Rosa's strengths.'' In A SEA-CHANGE ($6.95), a former model flees to a remote island after she is raped in her New York apartment and embarks on a strange new life. In 1976, our reviewer, Anne Tyler, called Ms. Gould's ''crisply written'' book ''a bizarre fantasy about one mild woman transformed by rage.'' FINAL ANALYSIS ($6.95), published in 1974, is about a journalist who has an affair with her former analyst, and it's not clear who is analyzing whom. One reviewer described the novel as ''a slick romance . . . which is occasionally quite funny.'' In NECESSARY OBJECTS ($7.95), four rich sisters, heiresses to a department store fortune, engage in sexual exploits and power plays worthy of the people on ''Dynasty.'' The sisters ''are horrible people, and their author depicts them here pitilessly and with an almost ferocious relish,'' Sara Blackburn said in The Book Review in 1972. LONGING FOR THE HARMONIES: Themes and Variations From Modern Physics, by Frank Wilczek and Betsy Devine. (Norton, $9.95.) With the mad confusion of subatomic particles and quasars, pulsars and black holes, the music of the spheres sometimes seems more like Stockhausen than Brahms; but beneath it all, physicists like to think, there is a subtle, enduring order. ''Mr. Wilczek and Ms. Devine describe the current research into their universe, and many of the researchers, with zest and humor,'' David Perlman said here last year. ''And if their descriptions at times demand a lay reader's closest attention and thought, the effort is immensely worthwhile.'' WHAT IS IT THEN BETWEEN US? by Ehud Havazelet. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) When this first book of short stories about urban life was published last year, The Times's Michiko Kakutani said Ehud Havazelet is ''an agile ventriloquist, practiced at throwing his voice and making it emerge convincingly from a wide variety of characters. . . . He is also the owner of that rarer gift of sympathy, an unsentimental compassion for bruised and disordered lives.'' FLANAGAN'S VERSION: A Spectator's Guide to Science on the Eve of the 21st Century, by Dennis Flanagan. (Vintage, $8.95.) After spending 35 years as editor of Scientific American, Dennis Flanagan learned that science is the greatest spectator sport of all. Last year our reviewer, James Trefil, called this book ''a raconteur's ramble along the highways and byways of modern science. . . . Mr. Flanagan's descriptions occasionally rise to the level of poetry.'' THE SHIFTING POINT: 1946-1987, by Peter Brook. (Bessie/Perennial/Harper & Row, $9.95.) When this collection of essays was published in 1987, our reviewer, Francis King, said the director Peter Brook is the ''most original and creative theoretician'' of the theater. ''There is hardly a piece [ here ] that does not have something fascinating to say - not merely to those who look to the theater for their livelihood, but to those who go to it for enjoyment, instruction and, above all, for the 'interest' that, in his final essay, Mr. Brook interprets as taking in all those aspects of living that are directly related to essential questions of being and becoming.''",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

In his second novel, Ralph Peters, a United States Army intelligence officer, has concocted a might-yet-be tale of conventional war on the terrain where, according to the conventional wisdom, the Western allies would logically expect to meet the forces of the Eastern bloc - namely, the same German plains that have seen other invaders, from the Goths of the late Roman Empire to the Soviet troops of World War II. The tactics and strategy in ''Red Army'' are those of conventional armor and infantry, the weapons state-of-the-art for the near future. In other words, there's no high-tech gimmickry here. Instead, Mr. Peters attempts to paint a picture not of tanks and helicopters but of Russian fighting soldiers. Curiously, however, his officers, although well drawn, are more or less what one might expect. Among these are Chibisov, the general who feels ''compelled to struggle relentlessly against every last vestige of his Jewishness,'' and Malinsky, the commander of the Western front, a realist whose family has fought for Russia since Peter the Great. But if the generals are out of Tolstoy, the ordinary soldiers are out of Stephen Crane by Bill Mauldin. The war itself is bloody, and is fought against a Western alliance whose members (particularly the Germans) are uncommitted to a united defense. As with most wars, the ending of this one is inconclusive. Indeed, what comes out of this very readable novel is a feeling that while the wars change, the soldiers remain the same.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Had Henry Benjamin Greenberg lived to complete his autobiography, the story of his life in baseball would probably have been as flat as his big feet. Happily, his family sought the help of Ira Berkow, a New York Times sports columnist. The collaboration was unusual. Greenberg died at the age of 75 on Sept. 4, 1986. Mr. Berkow inherited 800 pages of rambling conversation that Greenberg had dictated, and edited those words into the heart of the book. Greenberg, who played for the Detroit Tigers from 1933 until 1946, with four years out for military service during World War II, relates the usual baseball lore. He tells stories of players' shenanigans, names the greats of the game and recalls his good and bad days at the plate. He was contentious during the annual contract talks and explains why. He was contemptuous of managers who coldly cut aging veterans, even Babe Ruth, from the roster. Latter-day players who outdistanced Greenberg in the record books have written similar stories. What was special about this player beyond his 6-foot 4-inch frame, dedication to the game and courtly manner? Greenberg is one of two Jewish players - Sandy Koufax is the other - to be named to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Greenberg does not deny his heritage, but he does not make much of it. It is Mr. Berkow who adds perspective and stature to Greenberg through interviews with sportswriters and the player's family, friends and colleagues. Greenberg was remembered by players and writers for his grace under the almost daily pressure of anti-Semitic vulgarities shouted by opposing teams and fans. He was regarded as the model by Jackie Robinson and other minority players who tried to concentrate on the game and ignore the viciousness of racial discrimination. Such a contribution is reason enough to celebrate Greenberg's life.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Jazz's big stars, the ones who can fill concert halls for the JVC Jazz Festival-New York (which starts Friday) and for similar festivals around the world, are becoming a gerontocracy with no obvious successors. As time passes and the obituaries mount up, a vacuum grows in what festivals define as the jazz mainstream: the recognized names - like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Lionel Hampton, Sarah Vaughan or Joe Williams - who command large, loyal audiences. Meanwhile, New York's other summer jazz festivals - Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center, Jazz in July at the 92d Street Y and three Carnegie Hall Jazz Heritage Concerts - are largely archival. Hence, the laments and the extrapolation: jazz has no future, and its glories are all in the past.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Why You'll Never Have Fun in Russian,"If Russians and Americans are really beginning to talk together, how do we sound to each other in translation? Even when all borders are open, language can still throw up surprising barriers. Translation as a form of glasnost was the subject of a recent conference at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Aleksei Mikhalev, the translator of John Steinbeck's ''East of Eden'' and Muriel Spark's ''Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' described the difficulties of turning English into Russian. Richard Lourie, who published two suspense novels about Soviet-American relations and translated Andrei D. Sakharov's memoirs and Andrei Sinyavsky's novel ''Good Night,'' took on Russian to English. Here's part of what they said. Richard Lourie: In his brilliant and vastly entertaining biography of Gogol, Vladimir Nabokov devoted 12 pages (out of 155) to defining and musing upon a single ''pitiless'' Russian word, poshlost. An abstract noun, poshlost means moral tackiness and all its works, everything that is ''falsely important, falsely beautiful,'' everything that is mediocre and proud of it. Nabokov, the patron saint of the Russian-English continuum simply by virtue of his achievements in both languages, devoted nearly 10 percent of his book to a single word, but the translator encountering that word must render it with considerably more brevity.",1989-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Before that he set records in high school in New York City and at the University of California at Los Angeles.

us,Question Box,"Temperamental Golfer Q. Tommy Bolt was reputed to have the worst temper in golf years ago, but he had some successes in the game, too. How good a player was he? A. Good enough to win the United States Open by four strokes over Gary Player in Tulsa, Okla., 31 years ago, and impressive enough to have won 14 other tournaments. Though he never led the annual money-winning standing in his years on the tour from 1950 to 1964, Bolt, now 71 years old, might have led in club-throwing as he drew warnings, reprimands, fines and even suspensions for his outbursts on the course. Still, he earned $320,792 and finished ahead of the field in such major events as the Los Angeles Open (1952 and 1955), the San Diego Open (1953 and 1955), the Tucson Open (1953 and 1955) and, of course, the United States Open (1958). In that tournament, which required 36 holes on the last day, Bolt led after each round with scores of 71, 71, 69, 72 for 283 at the Southern Hills Country Club. A Slugger, Briefly Q. When Davey Johnson, now the manager of the Mets, was a player, he hit 43 home runs in 1973 for Atlanta and earned a place in the record book with Rogers Hornsby for the most home runs by a second baseman in one season. What was Johnson's next-highest season total and what was his career total? A. If anyone had saluted Johnson's achievement that season with the expression ''more power to him,'' he could not have been more wrong. When it came to power, Johnson never had a season remotely close to that one during a 17-year career with the Baltimore Orioles, the Braves, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs. His second-best home run total was 18 with the Orioles in 1971, and the season after he belted 43 homers he managed only 15 for the Braves. Over his career Johnson hit 136 homers, which means his 1973 total was nearly one-third his career total.",1989-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'It's a Cruel Game Sometimes',"IN the scorer's tent, Tom Kite turned and stared out under his white visor at the 18th green where he had hoped to be but where Curtis Strange soon would be presented with the United States Open trophy. Over nearly two decades, the sturdy little 39-year-old Texan has earned more than $4 million on the PGA Tour without winning a major championship. And with 14 holes remaining yesterday at Oak Hill, he had a three-stroke lead. But he collapsed with a 78, eight over par, finishing five strokes behind the first repeat champion since Ben Hogan in 1951. ''Too bad,'' an official told him. His face tight and grim, Kite nodded and walked down behind the scorer's tent, past where Strange was being interviewed on television and toward the golf cart that would take him to the media center's interview area. When some spectators noticed him, they called, ''Nice try'' and ''Nice tournament'' and he nodded. Then he looked over to where some friends were standing. But his wife wasn't with them. ''Have you seen Christy?'' he said. Without a word, they shook their heads. ''Meet us back at the house,'' he said. The golf cart was moving now. ''It's a cruel game sometimes,'' he said quietly. ''It's a cruel game.'' Without another word, he sat there as the golf cart weaved through more spectators who called, ''Nice try'' and ''Nice tournament.'' But he knew he hadn't really given it a good try. He knew that his tournament had turned into a disaster just when he thought he might win not only the Open but also, even more important, his first major title.",1989-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Columbus Park Trattoria Very Good (Nov. 6, 1988), 205 Main Street, Stamford (203-967-9191) -This storefront restaurant has the ambiance and clientele of a comfortable neighborhood spot where the menu inspires memories of hearty Italian home cooking. Appetizers excel here, and one might consider ordering an appetizer and pasta rather than a full meal. Some choice starters are the bruschetta; fried calamari with fra diavolo sauce, and shiitake mushrooms grilled with garlic halves and served on arugula. Other exceptional dishes are orecchiette with broccoli and sun-dried tomatoes; scampi alla romana, and coniglio alla cacciatore. Appetizers are $3.50 to $7.50, pastas $9.95 to $12.95, entrees $12.95 to $17.95. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5 to 10 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Harry's Texas Barbecue And Arizona Grill Good (May 21, 1989), 934 Hope Street, Stamford (203-348-7427) - Old-fashioned Southern-style barbecue is the specialty of this house, where the hickory-fueled smoker turns out savory beef, chicken and pork. Stucco walls are painted in a Southwestern palette, and cactus plants and Western art posters evoke a pleasant if minimal sense of place. Barbecue is served in combination platters along with potato, corn bread and cole slaw. Recommended menu items include barbecued chicken wings; baked beans; potato skins; herbed chicken, and the sparerib platter. ''Lites'' are smaller portions of spareribs and chicken that could appeal to families with children. Entrees are $4.95 to $11.95. Open 11:30 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Closed Monday. Maison le Blanc Very Good (Aug. 14, 1988), Route 7, New Milford (203-354-9931) - One of the better new restaurants in the northwest corner of the state, Maison le Blanc incorporates cozy dining rooms in a white colonial house on the Housatonic. Lace curtains and flowered wallpaper decorate the rooms; the menu is country French. Escargots Madagascar (prepared with green peppercorns in a cream sauce, served in puff pastry) and seafood sausage with lobster sauce are acclaimed appetizers. On the entree side are sweetbreads braised with shallots; bourride Provencale, a terrine of fish with garlic, tomato and saffron; loin of lamb with a tarragon-meat glaze, and lobster Marie Antoinette, the lobster meat poached and placed back in the shell and served with a sauce of Pernod, an herb beurre blanc and julienne of vegetables. Entrees are $13.50 to $19.50. Open 5:30 to 8:30 P.M. Tuesday to Thursday, until 9:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday and 3 P.M. to 8 P.M. Sunday. Peppercorn Grill Very Good (Feb. 14, 1988), 357 Main Street, Hartford (203-547-1714) -Bring a healthy appetite to this colorful cafe where mesquite-grilled entrees compete for attention with pizzas, small plates and inventive pasta dishes. Neon sculpture and park-bench seating offer visual appeal. From the grill there is a a variety of fish or breast of free-range chicken. Pastas include scallop-and-lobster ravioli; linguine with clams, shrimp, calamari, tomato and chilies, and pasta with five cheeses and grilled vegetables.

Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5:30 to 9 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Saigon City Very Good (March 26, 1989), 1180 Chapel Street, New Haven (203-865-5033) - New Haven, like many other college towns, supports many restaurants serving international cuisines. One of the newest is Saigon City. The moderately priced menu uses one to three stars to indicate mildly spicy, spicy and very spicy dishes. But even the no-star items are deftly seasoned. As starters, lime chicken, spring rolls or Vietnamese salad are recommended. One successful entree is called Saigon sound pancake, a plate-sized, browned pancake filled with shrimp, pork, chicken and vegetables. Other good choices are ginger squid sauteed with scallions, and lemon grass chicken. Prices are $3.95 to $5.75 at lunch, $8.25 to $13.95 at dinner. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M.

Chiggers, flies and other insects will also be out looking for food. Here are ways to keep flying pests, particularly mosquitoes, from assaulting you. Repellents: Repellents containing DEET are most effective, but apply with care. Do not apply to hands or face or use in concentrations stronger than 50 percent; 15 percent is recommended. Clothing: Don't look like a flower. Many bugs are attracted to bright colors. Perspiration: Wash off perspiration. Sweat produces a scent that attracts bugs. Chlorine: Add a capful or two of chlorinated bleach to your bath water or take a swim in a chlorinated pool. The smell repels most insects. Sun oil: Oily sun screens make skin too slippery for insects to get a grip. Food and fragrance: Avoid alcohol and foods high in serotonin, like bananas and nuts. Mosquitoes are attracted to those scents. Avoid perfume, cologne and hair spray. (Sources: Dr. Roger Grothaus, Raid Center for Insect Control, Racine, Wis., Dr. Jeffrey D.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CROWN OKLAHOMA. By Jim Lehrer. (Putnam's, $18.95.) This book is a perfect example of why it's dangerous to advertise a novel as humorous. When, exactly, are we supposed to get to the funny parts? In ''Crown Oklahoma,'' Jim Lehrer, of television's ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,'' has written the further adventures of One-Eyed Mack, a character he created in a previous novel called ''Kick the Can.'' In this installment, set in the early 1970's, Mack has grown up to become ''the first one-eyed lieutenant governor in Oklahoma history,'' a joke that is tossed out whenever the going gets slow, which is often. Mack, whose job description is not lengthy, is supposed to watch the television news so he can tell the governor if anything important happens. Sure enough, while Roger Mudd is substituting for the vacationing Walter Cronkite, there's a story about a new crime organization, based in ''a state known for its football.'' The group, dubbed the Okies, is apparently set to battle it out with the Mafia. Tracking both this mysterious organization and Archibald Tyler, the CBS correspondent who keeps making the story juicier, is now Mack's mission. Unfortunately he can't get much help from the governor, whose goal in life is to see that the state Capitol gets a dome. (The novel's title refers to this obsession.) The Okie crime organization scheme is meant to sound farfetched, and Mr. Lehrer uses it to get in his licks about responsibility, and the lack thereof, in television journalism. In doing so, ''Crown Oklahoma'' is good-hearted and inoffensive. Occasionally it's even funny.",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

''Among democratic nations, ambition is ardent and continual, but its aim is not habitually lofty; and life is generally spent in eagerly coveting small objects.'' Toqueville's observation was written more than 150 years ago, but it still applies today, Laurence Shames asserts in his suggestive study of contemporary American mores, ''The Hunger for More.'' Mr. Shames, the author of ''The Big Time: The Harvard Business School's Most Successful Class and How It Shaped America'' and a former columnist on ethics for Esquire, chronicles the social and economic forces that gave rise to the yuppies and the materialistic fast-track America of the 1980's. He begins by placing the current decade's fixation on glitz and money in the broader context of the United States' centuries-old romance with business success. But the love affair of the 1980's, Mr. Shames argues, is based on an assumption that no longer holds: that the economic boom would last forever. This new reality was brought home with a shock by the stock-market crash on Oct. 19, 1987, an event that Mr. Shames believes helped many to realize the emptiness of careerist values. The author is at his most persuasive when analyzing what he calls the ''war between life and lifestyle'' - the tendency to confuse style with substance, a fashionable surface with authentic feeling. His critique is on the mark, but unfortunately he tends to be overly abstract and facile. The single case history he uses to tie his book together, however - the Colliers, a dual-career couple on Manhattan's Upper West Side who realize that they must change their lives - makes concrete, compelling argument in itself.",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Soviet Union,"To the Editor: My husband's and my experiences on three recent trips to various parts of the Soviet Union differ greatly from the complaints of Betty Tyler of Monroe, Conn. (Letters on Travel, April 2). On one trip to Leningrad, my husband and I purchased taxi chits one morning from a young woman stationed near the front entrance of Hotel Pribaltiskaya and were escorted by her to a waiting cab. She instructed the driver as to our destination, the Hermitage Art Museum, where we spent several hours, having the third floor (French Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings) almost entirely to ourselves. Throughout the Soviet Union we have found attendants at cloak check rooms (a Soviet custom to avoid having heavy coats take up needed seat space at performances or restaurants) to be kind and helpful, especially to foreigners. One evening in Kiev's concert hall, following a piano concert by a superb recent participant in the Tschaikowsky competition, my husband and I, evidently the only foreigners attending the performance, lined up with the Ukrainians to get our coats. We were near the end of a long line when an attendant behind the cloak room counter began beckoning vigorously to us. People ahead of us turned around and explained that she wanted us to come up and be served first. We demurred and replied that we would wait our turn; but everyone insisted, saying, ''You are our guests.''",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"JAMES BALDWIN: Artist on Fire. By W. J. Weatherby. (Fine, $19.95.) For nearly two decades, beginning in the 1950's, James Baldwin was one of America's leading writers. An accomplished novelist and relentless traveler, he was best known for works of essay-reportage - such as ''The Fire Next Time,'' first published in 1962 in The New Yorker - that explored black sensibilities in the civil rights movement, with a strong commitment to interracial harmony. W. J. Weatherby has written a moving account of Baldwin's life, especially the early years. Mr. Weatherby, a correspondent for The Manchester Guardian in New York, knew Baldwin for many years and interviewed him often, along with writers, activists, editors and others of his friends. The book suffers from excessive focus on the author-as-personality, with little analysis of Baldwin's writing. Footnotes are minimal; there is no bibliography. In his prime, James Baldwin was a magnificent writer; his later books proved a disappointment. By Mr. Weatherby's lights, that decline was the price of celebrity. At the end, Mr. Weatherby writes: ''A life was a journey, [ Baldwin ] was fond of saying, and you had to pay the price of the ticket. . . . What an incredible journey it had been.''",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

The soul standards are uproarious turns full of personality. (Holden) RCA 9660. LOUDON WAINWRIGHT 3D: ''THERAPY'' - Over 20 years Mr. Wainwright has accumulated a body of brutally frank comic songs that has almost become a folk genre unto itself.

Casals' robust dynamism is so gripping that certain exaggerations frowned upon today seem just right for Dvorak's music in his hands, and Szell's accompaniment is fully integrated with the soloist. Mark Obert-Thorn's transfers are expert; one soon finds oneself listening to the performances rather than the antiquated sonics. -Paul Turok Beethoven: The String Trios Anne-Sophie Mutter, violin; Bruno Giuranna, viola; Mstislav Rostropovich, cello. Deutsche Grammophon 427 687-2; two CD's only. This seemingly unlikely combination of superstars with disparate temperaments, nationalities and constituencies may be just the thing to draw broader attention to these voluble, vibrant creations of a burgeoning master - the six-movement, serenadelike Op. 3, the five-movement Serenade, Op. 8, and the three four-movement works of Op. 9, all completed before Beethoven turned 28. Ms. Mutter, sometimes cool in approaching the classics, and Mr. Rostropovich, as often superheated, meet somewhere in the vicinity of Mr. Giuranna's enveloping warmth in compelling performances, not as consistently bottom-heavy as the indomitable cellist's presence might lead one to fear. -James R. Oestreich Walton: 'Facade,' 'Facade 2'; Stravinsky: 'Renard' Peggy Ashcroft, Jeremy Irons, narrators (Walton); Philip Langridge, tenor, Robert Lloyd, bass, others (Stravinsky); London Sinfonietta conducted by Riccardo Chailly. London 421 717-2; CD only. Walton's sassy setting of 29 Edith Sitwell poems for rhythmic narration with small instrumental ensemble here fully lives up to its subtitle, ''An Entertainment.'' Ms. Ashcroft and Mr. Irons not only supply superb diction, enhanced by digital clarity, but reveal a dimension of emotion lurking under Sitwell's strange wordplay not often felt in other performances. Mr. Chailly and the excellent instrumentalists prove unfailingly precise as well. ''Facade 2'' consists of eight interestingly sparse settings that Walton excluded from the published version. Mr. Chailly's ''Renard'' is an urbane affair, lacking the rough-and-tumble atmosphere others have (perhaps more aptly) brought to the work. -P. T. '1588': Music From the Time of the Spanish Armada The York Waits. Saydisc CD-SDL 373; CD only. The York Waits, a British Renaissance band, recorded this collection last year to mark the 400th anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada. The battle serves as context and connective tissue (a few of the ballads describe it, or the men and ships that fought in it), but the Waits have wisely not made it the recording's sole focus. Included, too, are many more familiar tunes that were popular in Elizabethan England - most, domestic (John Johnson's ''Delight Pavan,'' the anonymous ''Robin Is to the Greenwood Gone'' and ''Watkins Ale''), with a sprinkling of dances imported from Italy and France. The works are arranged for shawms, sackbuts, lute, hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes and other gamy-sounding period instruments, all played spiritedly. -Allan Kozinn Weinberg: Symphony No. 6 (Op. 79); Shostakovich: From Jewish Folk Poetry (Op. 79) Lily Tuneh, soprano, Mira Zakai, alto, Neil Jenkins, tenor (Shostakovich); Neve-Shir Children's Choir (Weinberg); Jerusalem Symphony conducted by Yuri Ahronovitch. Stradivari Classics SCD 8005; CD only. These works have more than an opus number in common: Both reflect Jewish suffering and heroism. The Sixth Symphony of the Warsaw-born (1919) Moise Weinberg, who fled to the Soviet Union when Germany invaded Poland and became a leading musical figure in Moscow, is powerful and evocative. Three movements are settings for children's choir of poems about youth, death and hope. Shostakovich's score is arguably the most arresting of his Jewish-inspired works. These committed performances were recorded live at the Israel Festival in 1984 and 1985, respectively. What a difference a year made: The 1985 Jerusalem Symphony is a much better orchestra. Choir and soloists sing sensitively but with appalling diction, and no texts are provided. - Martin Bookspan POP/JAZZ Todd Rundgren: 'Nearly Human' Warner Bros. 25881; all three formats. ''Nearly Human'' finds the 41-year-old ex-boy-wonder of the recording studio still sorting through the hippie dreams of the late 60's and early 70's in songs that meditate on the gulf between everyday pain and cruelty and humanity's loftiest ideas of itself. Musically, this is Mr. Rundgren's most accessible album in years, still using the vocabulary of late-60's Philadelphia soul. To insure spontaneity, the album was recorded live in the studio after extensive rehearsals with a pop-soul band. Many of the cuts use at least five backup singers, whose elaborately arranged parts give the feel of a pop-jazz chorus. The recorded sound is oddly dry and trebly. -Stephen Holden Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan: 'Two of a Mind' Bluebird/RCA 9654-2-RB; all three formats. Like the poet Philip Larkin, the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond has honed his passion into a restrained lyricism. His orderly solos and vibratoless, liquid tones show a thorough knowledge of modern chord changes and time. But he often sounds like a New Orleans clarinetist who enjoys contrapuntal play rather than the dirty blues. In this collaboration with Gerry Mulligan, their third date together and their best, the saxophones chase each other without worry about a piano. The players' rapport throughout, especially in ''Out of Nowhere'' and ''Two of a Mind,'' and the fine solos - Mr. Mulligan in an elliptical ''Stardust,'' Mr. Desmond in his overdubbed specialty ''The Way You Look Tonight'' - offer evidence of a shared sensibility: a cooler, paler, slower Bird and Diz. -Richard B. Woodward Mavis Staples: 'Time Waits For No One' Paisley Park 25798; all three formats. The first solo album since 1976 by the Mississippi-born gospel singer was primarily produced by Prince, and its mixture of warm Southern soul-singing and gimmicky Minneapolis studio funk, though not always comfortable, is more harmonious than one might have expected. In the best cuts, like the lovelorn ''Come Home,'' which Prince wrote and produced in a style that deliberately echoes Willie Mitchell's 70's productions for Al Green, he extends himself knowledgeably into Ms. Staples' territory. In other cuts, like ''Interesting'' and ''Jaguar,'' her personality is all but smothered in Princely sound effects. -S. H. L. L. Cool J.: 'Walking With a Panther' Def Jam/Columbia 45172; all three formats. Fast, offbeat rhymes and a skill with polysyllables made L. L. Cool J. a rap phenomenon. Now the 21-year-old James Todd Smith, a k a L(adies) L(ove) Cool J(ames), has followed his second album, ''Bigger and Deffer,'' with more of the same on his self-produced ''Walking With a Panther.'' Over plain, midtempo funk, he glorifies himself and dismisses other rappers as imitators and other males as cuckolds and losers; elsewhere, he totes up his sexual conquests or speaks honeyed come-ons. One ballad, ''Two Different Worlds'' cleverly juxtaposes a cooing singer (Cydne Monet) and his own rap; of the boasts, ''Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?'' has the most motor-mouth virtuosity. But it's about time for Mr. Smith to look somewhere besides the mirror. -Jon Pareles Strata Institute: 'Cipher Syntax.' JMT/Polygram 834 425-4; all three formats. Despite a pretentious title (a note says it refers to a dialect of the M-Base language - ooh, cool), this group, featuring Steve Coleman and Greg Osby atop a brilliant rhythm section, means business when it starts to play. Neither nostalgic nor eclectic, it has created a dense, thrilling sound unlike anyone else's. Several songs could have used more cooking in the group's Brooklyn laboratory, but the album closes with a flourish of original music: the full-tilt ''Micro-move''; ''Humantic,'' a dark, sexy ballad with odd time changes; Mr. Osby's eerie ''Abacus''; and ''Ighnat,'' like a discourse on a James Brown riff. Even when trading fours, the players acknowledge tradition with a nod rather than a bowed head. -R. B. W.",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

He is a professional football player, a defensive lineman for the Atlanta Falcons. When he could be taking the summer off, relaxing before training camp starts in August, the Massapequa resident is busy rescuing people from the Atlantic surf. ''There's nowhere else I'd rather be on a summer weekend,'' he said. Being a lifeguard and playing professional football is a Baldinger family tradition. There are three Baldinger brothers; all are professional football players and all have been Tobay lifeguards during the off season.",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING. By Gilda Radner. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.) Gilda Radner, who died of cancer May 20 at the age of 42, yearned to close her cathartic memoir with the words ''and she gets well.'' But she writes that the discovery a year ago of new sites from the ovarian cancer first diagnosed in 1986, on the heels of national publicity about her supposed cure, forced her instead to face cancer's treacherous realities for the first time. The spirited star of ''Saturday Night Live'' has laid out all the horrors of surgery and chemotherapy, but there are also lighter moments, like her 1984 marriage to the actor Gene Wilder; reminiscences from her childhood and career; and sappy stories about the dog who fulfilled her painfully thwarted maternal instinct. Radner, who knew herself well, has commented insightfully about how the performer's need for control conflicted with what a friend calls the ''delicious ambiguity'' of living with cancer. Though rich in friends, loved ones and paid helpers, she found the support group called the Wellness Community her most effective prop, and an outlet for her comedic talents. ''Cancer, I decided, needed a comedienne to come in there and lighten it up.'' There were joyful moments even during the period, after the recurrence, when she turned to alternative therapies, but her final pages are deeply somber, the sense of doom palpable. Though slow, meandering, detailed to a fault and sometimes marred by forced humor, ''It's Always Something'' is compelling as testimony from the cancer wars by a courageous and much-loved entertainer who liked herself enough to share her suffering in her own style.",1989-06-25T05:00:00+0000

Suppose that a peeved Darryl Strawberry manages to hit 32 home runs by the All-Star Game one of these seasons, but is so unhappy playing for the Mets that they decide to trade him to an American League team, such as Toronto, during the All-Star Game break. If Strawberry hits 30 home runs for the Blue Jays during the rest of the season for a total of 62, will he be recognized as baseball's career leader for most home runs in a season? A. He would go down as the major league leader for one season, but the American and National League leaders would not be dislodged from their places in the record book, according to the commissioner's office, which had to deal with a similar problem 28 years ago. When Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961 and broke Babe Ruth's sacred mark, Maris created a quandary of Ruthian proportions because the American League played a 162-game season that year and Ruth had made his mark in the 154-game format of 1927. So the record book now lists Maris as the American League (and therefore major league) leader for 162-game seasons and Ruth as the leader for 154-game seasons. It also singles out Hack Wilson (56 homers for the Chicago Cubs in 1930) as the National League leader for a 154-game schedule and Willie Mays (52 in 1965 for the San Francisco Giants) and George Foster (52 for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977) as the National League co-leaders for a 162-game season.",1989-06-26T05:00:00+0000

Bartlett Giamatti: The commissioner of baseball, whose office is conducting the Rose inquiry and who can suspend Rose for life if he determines he bet on his team. Judge Norbert A. Nadel: A Hamilton County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas judge who granted a temporary restraining order Sunday that blocked the baseball commissioner from holding a hearing with Rose into the manager's betting activities, saying the commissioner has prejudged the case. John Dowd: A former Justice Department lawyer now in private practice in Washington who led the investigation of Rose for Giamatti. Ron Peters: A bookmaker and bar owner who told Dowd's investigators in April that Rose bet more than $1 million with him over a two-year period, including bets on Reds' games. Paul Janszen: A body-builder friend of Rose, who told Dowd he placed bets for Rose with Peters. Rose's attorneys say he said in the presence of a friend, Danita Marcum, ''that he was going to take Pete Rose down with him unless he was paid money.'' He gave the F.B.I. betting sheets, which included bets on Reds games, that he said he took from Rose's home. Tommy Gioiosa: A longtime friend of Rose who lived in the manager's home for several years as a teen-ager. He was a regular at Gold's Gym, a reputed center for drug traffickers and gamblers and allegedly ran bets for Rose. He is facing Federal charges of tax evasion and conspiracy. Mike Bertolini: A Brooklyn resident and business partner of Rose whom the Dowd report says handled bets for him with New York bookies. Val: A Staten Island bookmaker Janszen told investigators had taken bets from Rose through Bertolini. At one point he refused any further bets because Rose owed him $34,000. Steve Chevashore: Handled bets for Rose in Florida during spring training of 1987. The report says Janszen as the intermediary was never to use the word ''bet'' nor Rose's name. They did have an understanding, however, that the bets Janszen was placing for Rose would always be for $2,000.",1989-06-27T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current. Amsterdam's Bar And Rotisserie * (March 3, 1989), 428 Amsterdam Avenue, at 80th Street (874-1377) -This popular Upper West Side establishment has a front room with bar, an open rotisserie section and an elevated back room with whitewashed brick walls, black tin ceiling and cafe tables. For a late-night supper, you might try Amsterdam's signature dish: roast chicken, which is usually moist with a nice blistered skin and is served with clean and crisp french fries. Light dishes for late at night would also include spaghettini with tomato, basil and mozzarella; sesame ginger noodles, and assorted crostini of roasted red peppers, chicken livers, and tomato, garlic and basil. Appetizers are $5.95 to $6.95, entrees $9.95 to $15.95. Open noon to 12:30 A.M. Sunday to Thursday, until 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday. Canal Bar * (Dec. 16, 1988), 511 Greenwich Street, at Spring Street (334-5150) -From outside, the restaurant has all the charm of a muffler repair shop. Inside, though, it is as hip as a 1957 Chevy convertible. This former diner has been converted into a stylishly tacky nightspot where restive downtowners display their latest vintage clothes and hair colors. There are three dining areas, all explosively noisy. For starters the late-supper menu offers fish chowder with corn, green salad with fresh herbs, red-pepper-and-mozzarella salad, melted chevre on toast, a leek-and-tomato tart and Nicoise pizza. Then there are such possibilities as a pasta of the day; croque-monsieur; grilled chicken, arugula-and-Parmesan sandwich, and the old standby, hamburger. For desserts there are hot apple tart with ice cream, and chocolate cake. Late-supper dishes are $4 to $9.50; Black Angus steak with french fries is $24. Dinner is 7 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. daily, late supper 12:30 to 2 A.M. Tuesday to Saturday. Maxim's ** (April 21, 1989), 680 Madison Avenue, at 61st Street (751-5111) - This clone of Paris's legendary nightspot has multi-level dining rooms that shine with burnished rosewood walls, vines of hammered brass, sylvan murals, stained glass and plush banquettes and tables. A late-night supper could begin with tuna carpaccio - a glistening sheet of fresh tuna garnished with asparagus spears, colorful salad greens, fresh herbs and caviar. This could be followed by braised red snapper over a slice of fennel. One of the bright and intense sorbets would make a light finale. Appetizers are $9 to $18, entrees $24 to $36. Dinner is 6 P.M. to midnight Tuesday to Thursday (music begins at 7 P.M., dancing at 9); 6 P.M. to 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday (music from 8 P.M., dancing from 10). Mezzogiorno ** (May 13, 1988), 195 Spring Street (334-2112) - At this buoyant North Italian restaurant, you encounter a long marble-topped bar at the entrance flanked by cafe tables along the white-paned windows; the playful back room has a long tan banquette on one wall and tables around a faux marble column. There are sprightly carpaccios, salads and vivid pastas, and from 10 P.M. until 1 A.M. the menu expands to include excellent brick-oven pizzas (behind the bar is a giant ceramic mask whose mouth is the opening for the pizza oven). The thin crusts are nicely charred, with toppings ranging from potato and sun-dried tomato to pancetta and onion, mixed vegetables and wild mushrooms. Appetizers are $9 to $12, carpaccios $10, pastas $11 and $14, pizzas $11 to $12. Lunch is noon to 3 P.M., dinner 6 P.M. to 1 A.M. Monday to Friday. Open noon to 1 A.M.
