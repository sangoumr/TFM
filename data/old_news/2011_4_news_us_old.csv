Historical fiction is typically so ample and epilogic that the historical short story may seem a contradiction in terms, but Shepard has made himself, in particular, a master of this small, tricky subgenre.

A lifelong outsider and champion of the underdog, Murray grew up among impoverished farmers in rural Australia, where, as an overweight redneck teenager, he was mercilessly tormented at school. Today he is the closest thing Australia has to a national poet. A sui generis autodidact (he now suspects he has Aspergers syndrome) equipped with a fierce moral vision and a sensuous musicality, he writes subtly about postcolonialism, urban sprawl and poverty and, in his most intimate poems, reminds us of the power of literature to transubstantiate grievance into insight. (His admirers have argued he ought to be considered for a Nobel.) But he is equally capable of writing emotionally simplistic and strangely soured poems in which the enraged adolescent emerges all but unmediated. This mercurial doubleness can make his work hard to categorize or describe: this is a mind at once revolutionary and reactionary. Or maybe just a poet whos willing to show more id than most.",2011-04-01T16:42:14+0000

The Hollywood Reporter said that Mr. Hayes will join Will Sasso, of Mad TV and $#*! My Dad Says, who is set to play the follicularly deficient Curly Howard. The movie is not a biographical film and will instead feature a slapstick trio in new comedy sketches based on the original Stooges. It has already taken a few eye gouges en route to the big screen: at one time, the planned cast included Sean Penn as Larry, Jim Carrey as Curly and Benicio Del Toro as Moe, but that fell apart like a high-society pie dinner after Mr. Penn withdrew from the project.

It features more than 220 artifacts, including a Dansk ice bucket, a Norman Bel Geddes soda siphon, Paco Rabanne purses and lots of little black dresses (as well as the red one shown below, by Norman Norell). The show begins in the 1920s, when American cocktail culture was mostly confined to the home, and the French, with their beaded cocktail dresses and Ren Lalique Art Deco glass, set the standard for a night on the town. But the most durable pieces, the ones that youd still want to break out for guests today, date from the 1950s, when every hour was happy hour and cocktail design was strained through a Modernist sieve.

As my colleague David Brooks writes today, it is the most comprehensive and most courageous budget reform proposal any of us have seen in our lifetimes. It puts flesh on the bones of the standard-issue conservative pledge to limit governments growth, and it does so not with evasive pledges on process (like the risible idea of a balanced budget amendment) or dishonest suggestions that the deficit can be erased by defunding N.P.R. and slashing foreign aid, but by attacking entitlement spending deeply and directly. George W. Bush touched the third rail of American politics with his Social Security gambit, and lived to regret it. With their proposal to transform Medicare from an open-ended entitlement to a system that provides support for seniors premiums, Ryan and the Republicans are reaching out and grabbing it with both hands. In the process, they are being brutally honest with the American people, in ways that the Obama White House has repeatedly refused to be, about the scale of the deficit challenge and the scope of the reforms needed to address it.",2011-04-05T15:49:32+0000

Although final audience figures for CBSs live broadcast of the N.C.A.A. mens championship game were not immediately available on Tuesday, preliminary overnight estimates were down slightly compared with last year, when 23.9 million watched the title matchup on CBS. Despite that modest decline, the games ratings were still high enough that CBS might have led the night over all were it not for lower ratings preceding the basketball coverage for sitcom reruns at 8 and 8:30, The Big Bang Theory (9.6 million) and Rules of Engagement (7.4 million). The repeats lagged in comparison with ABCs 10 p.m. audience for Castle (11.7 million) following Dancing With the Stars. NBC ranked third with Harrys Law at 10 (7.4 million) following a rerun of Chuck at 8 (2.5 million) and The Event at 9 (3.9 million).

Their Salento Farm in Shelton, Conn., may not be monocultural, but its close to it. They grow only garlic and eggplant. Their garlic is German hard neck, and they chop it up with garlic scapes, adding olive oil and Parmigiano-Reggiano to make a garlic pesto, so you can banish mint jelly forever for that spring lamb roast. They also dry and pulverize it to make first-rate pungent garlic powder to use in dry rubs, to season your pizza dough, and so forth. Ours is all garlic, nothing else, not like the commercial brands, Mr. Salvati said, as he won over a garlic powder skeptic at his new stand in the Greenmarket. Their tangy pickled eggplant is excellent on a bruschetta. In fall and winter, they sell the garlic heads, too. ",2011-04-05T22:38:35+0000

We did parties last month for the First Precinct and the Hells Angels, said Paul Sevigny, who, along with Nur Khan, began working with Hill about seven months ago to bring some new blood to the place. Thats how universally loved he was. Loved, yes, but also a mystery even to those who knew him  details about his family and childhood remain fuzzy. Youd go in there with someone whod never been and youd be like, Oh, theres Don! And people would be like, Theres actually a Don Hill? said the makeup artist Mike Potter. People didnt know he was a real person. Like many, Potter, a club regular in the 90s, has Don Hills to thank for his career: After John Cameron Mitchell recognized him from the SqueezeBox party, the two became friendly, which led to Potter doing the makeup for Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Brendan Manning, of the New York City chapter of the Hells Angels, points out that Hill, whose memorial service is tonight at St. Patricks Cathedral in NoLIta, had booked  for $200 a week  a guy named Bruce Springsteen, back in the Kennys Castaways days. The Moment asked a few who knew Hill personally to tell us about him (in more than 140 characters).",2011-04-06T17:30:42+0000

A team from Cardiff University in Britain found the gene, NDM-1, in 11 different types of bacteria, including those that cause cholera and dysentery. Bacteria with NDM-1 have caused fatal infections in people hospitalized in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and in a few foreigners who visited those countries for surgery, but this is the first time they have been found in the environment. Their presence in water has not caused any known outbreaks of untreatable disease, but experts fear it could, especially in the rainy season. ",2011-04-08T01:47:07+0000

In the film Summertime, Katharine Hepburn played such a woman, on a solo vacation in Venice, winking back tears while maintaining perfect posture and a rigid smile.

What if a man was coming to lay claim to that chair, that coffee, that woman; and what if that woman wished he wouldnt, doesnt at all want a coffee and is aware now that were at an age when we must take care not to be embarrassing. Might the mans presence make the woman lonelier than his absence? In her new novel, The Love of My Youth, so nostalgic in its title, Mary Gordon overturns sentimental assumptions, redirecting the readers sympathies from what could have been to what in fact was  and to what therefore followed.

Random mutation and natural selection have indeed been powerful motors for change in the natural world  the struggle for existence pitting the fit against the fitter in a hullabaloo of rivalry.

Scott looks back at the trial and execution of St. Joan as recounted in the silent classic by the Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928). The film is based on the transcripts from the trial and explores it from a political and religious perspective. Theres something powerful and mysterious about beholding the image of a human face, Mr. Scott says about the films use of close-ups to build a kind of spiritual intensity. The entire first half is a succession of close-ups, which, Mr. Scott says, create a feeling of intimacy and confinement. And the drama, even the narrative itself, are contained within these faces. The film is ultimately more concerned with emotion than politics, making it that much more of a human story. The Passion of Joan of Arc creates an uncanny, unforgettable, almost unique sense of connection to its main character, Mr. Scott says. We may not ultimately understand Joan, but we know her.

In the journal Sociological Spectrum, she reports that blacks have lower rates of drug use than whites during early adolescence, but this gap gets inverted as they age. That is to say, whites are more likely to age out of drug usethey stop as they get older. Blacks, perhaps because of work, economic and family conditions, age out less, so by middle age they are using drugs more than whites. This would seem to put a dent in the theory that blacks suffer higher rates of drug use because they are more likely to grow up in single parent homes.

But when you consider the evidence, its hard not to believe he created it himself. Decades before YouTube and years before the video camera became a common artists tool, Mr. Whitman, a kind of junkman of fleeting imagery, extolled the virtues of television as a great way to collect stuff; besides whats on the air, a camera on anything brings it in live. In 1972, in News, the first of his telephone pieces, he enlisted people around the city to use pay phones to call in descriptions of what they were doing or seeing at that moment, which the radio station WBAI broadcast live, a kind of aural Twitter stream. In one of his earliest theater pieces, American Moon, in 1960, he split the audience apart in separate tunnels to give each person a slightly different sense of the action. In doing so, he fulfilled what the curator Lynne Cook once described as his distinctive desire to work collectively to construct an experience intended for the solitary individual, a phrase that could just as well describe a lot of the social and cultural architecture of the Web.",2011-04-14T21:56:31+0000

Mukherjees writing is precise and vivid and you feel like youre in the hands of a very thoughtful, exacting authority.

us,Shakespeare Subpoenaed,"Kenji Yoshino is a respected legal scholar (the Chief Justice Earl Warren professor of constitutional law at New York University) who regularly teaches a course on literature and the law. The device he has come up with in A Thousand Times More Fair is to match a play of Shakespeare with some modern event or issue. One can see how this might stimulate class discussion, and it seems to succeed, since he tells us that his course on constitutional law is oversubscribed by two to one, but the class on literature and law has more applicants by six to one. The process apparently works. But what of the product? Considered apart from the give-and-take of the classroom, one of three things can be the result. First, the stereoscopic approach can deepen ones understanding of both a play and the event matched with it. Second, at least one of the pair can be given new understanding. Third, meaning can be drained, not deepened, on both sides of the matchup.",2011-04-15T16:05:11+0000

Fox led the night with 21 million viewers tuning for an elimination episode of Idol and 11.9 million at 9 p.m. for Bones. CBS placed second, despite broadcasting a line-up of all repeats.

Ms. Ni and her husband, Dong Jiqin, were taken on April 7 from a Beijing hotel where they had been living. Ms. Ni has not been charged with a crime. So far, four people have been criminally charged during the crackdown. Ms. Ni is likely to have come under increased scrutiny after Jon Huntsman Jr., the American ambassador, visited her in February. Mr. Huntsman and the United States government are suspected by some Chinese officials of promoting the calls for a so-called Jasmine Revolution to challenge Communist Party rule.

The median income figure the C.B.O. used (see Table 4-4 on p. 65 of the report) is $94,900 for a family of four, which (as a number of readers have noted) seems much higher than the usual estimates for median income in a four-person household. It turns out that I didnt catch a crucial footnote in the C.B.O. document: All income is assumed to be from compensation, which includes employment-based health insurance and the employers share of payroll taxes. That is to say, the $94,900 in income includes the estimated value of the median familys health care plan as well as their salary, which is not what most people think of when they hear the term median income.

He had the studied casualness of a catalog model, in khakis, at home in the viewfinder. She met the camera head-on, dressed in hand-loomed textile dyed indigo, a silver earring half-hidden in the cascading curtain of her dark hair. She carried her chin a few degrees higher than most. His right hand rested on her shoulder, lightly. The photograph, taken on a Manhattan rooftop in August 1987 and e-mailed to me 20 years later, was a revelation and a puzzle. The man was Barack Obama at 26, the community organizer from Chicago on a visit to New York. The woman was Stanley Ann Dunham, his mother.

Another festival organizer, Li Shanshan, told Global Times that about 20 overseas guests, 10 directors and around 40 fans had registered to attend the festival. The cancellation of the festival, which is usually held every year in Songzhuang, on the outskirts of Beijing, was first announced Monday on the festivals microblog on sina.com.

The Unknown is not a Lindbergh retrospective, says the museums director, Jerome Sans, but a body of work specifically assembled to mark his first experience with China. A gigantic remix without order or chronology, the installation is a visual journey through decades of the photographers career, including photos of supermodels like Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, most of which were commissioned for Italian Vogue by Franca Sozzani (who was present for the opening). Visitors enter the exhibition in a space surrounded by video images from Lindberghs recent cinematic series, Invasion, a film that depicts a crowd in slow motion moving into a cloud of smoke. Visitors to the exhibit suddenly realize they have become part of the silent choreography, as they watch their own shadows entering and exiting the images projected onto the walls.

Through the ministrations of a widowed aunt, Mary ultimately adopts a new vision of heaven  one in which peoples primary end is not union with God, but being reunited with loved ones.",2011-04-22T17:00:33+0000

In a preface to the new Bible, Miles Smith, one of the translators and a man so impatient that he once walked out of a boring sermon and went to the pub, wrote that anything new inevitably endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition. So there must have been disputes  shouting; table pounding; high-ruffed, black-gowned clergymen folding their arms and stomping out of the room  but there is no record of them. And the finished text shows none of the PowerPoint insipidness we associate with committee-speak or with later group translations like the 1961 New English Bible, which T.S. Eliot said did not even rise to dignified mediocrity. Far from bland, the King James Bible is one of the great masterpieces of English prose.",2011-04-23T17:22:31+0000

us,For the Record,"Indie record shops generally look like Championship Vinyl, the music-geek hangout owned by John Cusack in High Fidelity, which is to say the closest they get to dcor is the album covers on the wall. Everyone asks why we dont have records on the wall, says Ian Marshall, the co-owner, along with his wife, Jade Gordon, of L.A.s Wombleton Records. Its like its some sort of requirement. But when we opened the store we knew wed be spending a lot of time here and thats not really the kind of environment we wanted to be in. Instead, the couple has created a used-record shop that resembles a Victorian parlor, right down to the embossed wallpaper and potted plants. Marshall, a self-described Anglophile who grew up outside of Toronto but spent his school holidays visiting family in Britain, wanted the Highland Park store to have an English feel, a conceit that extends to its name, a play on the popular British childrens books (and later a BBC series) about the Wombles. To get Wombletons 19th-century ambience just right, the couple spent hours trawling eBay for vintage furniture and prevailed upon friends like David Donohue, a graphic designer and surf board builder who made the harpsichord-shaped record bins, and Nic Taylor and Jennifer Brandt-Taylor of Thunderwing Press, who created the stores logo, a stagecoach on LP wheels. Which is very apt, Marshall says. We spend a lot of time in foreign countries, driving around in rental cars looking for records. But perhaps the most refreshing quality about Wombleton is its lack of snobbery. Unlike Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Todd Louima), the musical moron twins who staffed Championship Vinyl, Marshall and Gordon, who stock an eclectic mix of British pop from the 60s, 70s and 80s, wont deride your taste.

Since those days, weve regressed to the (very human) mean: Were fascinated by the royal family that we once overthrew, we have our own hereditary dynasties (and the slobbering coverage to match), and weve gradually turned our presidency into a quasi-imperial office, complete with coronations and cultic devotions and all the rest. True, by the standards of modern history, with its parade of strongmen and caudillos and presidents-for-life, our republican institutions have been impressively resilient. But even the American experience suggests that the anti-monarchical temper Oppenheimer invokes is ultimately artificial and unnatural, a triumph of theory over instinct and idealism over human nature. In their hearts, most people want a king and queen. ",2011-04-28T17:43:49+0000

At least two women were killed in the operation, which was spurred by a shootout between security forces and militants in the village of Progress on the border with the Stavropol Region and the mostly Muslim region of Kabardino-Balkaria, Russias Investigative Committee said in a statement. It was the latest in an intensified campaign to eliminate Islamist fighters and their bases in the North Caucasus after a deadly terrorist attack at a Moscow airport in January that was linked to militants there. No one on the side of the security forces was wounded in the operation, officials said. ",2011-04-29T15:29:02+0000

Yet they were, and Maya Jasanoff, who teaches history at Harvard, has provided a richly informative account of those who made the choice to embrace imperial Britain. As earlier historians of the Revolution have pointed out, the loyalists tended to have strong connections to the imperial administration, belong to the Anglican Church and possess close business or family ties to Britain. But not all who left fitted such a profile. Escaped slaves had obvious reason to depart, and so did those whose property was confiscated by the revolutionaries. Most pervasively, of course, the loyalists shared a loyalty to the king. ",2011-04-29T16:52:23+0000

Her husband, a neuroscientist named Boris Izcovich, has asked for a pause in their marriage so he can take up with a younger colleague, a woman with whom he had no past. After a short, agonizing stay in a psychiatric ward, Mia decamps from her Brooklyn apartment to tiny Bonden, seeing no choice but to wait out the cruel crack of hope in her husbands request. There she finds herself immersed, somewhat accidentally, in an all-female world that includes her mothers five lively geriatric friends, the seven adolescent members of a poetry workshop and the young mother next door, whose husband travels often for work. Over the course of the summer, Mia confronts, with the help of phone sessions with her (female) therapist, her own history as a willing second-class citizen, a scribbler of the stolen interval who hadnt fought for myself.

In the scene, shown above, Ms. Rice, a former secretary of state and classically trained pianist, challenged Mr. Baldwin, a Lincoln Center regular himself, to a musical face-off. (Mr. Baldwin does not actually perform in the episode.) We asked Anthony Tommasini, the chief classical music critic of The Times, who interviewed Ms. Rice about her chamber music experience in a profile in 2005, to identify the pieces. They are all by Mozart, he said. The first is the opening of the third movement, the Rondo, from the Piano Quartet in G minor. The second is the opening of the first movement, the Allegro, of that same Piano Quartet in G minor. The third, and this gets complicated, is the slow movement, the Romanze, of the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, not the opening of the movement, but the beginning of the fast middle section of that movement. Whew. For insiders, Mr. Tommasini said, the joke is the snippets of pieces played are not at all pieces for flute. He added, He tried to match her playing this music on the solo flute, an unfair match.",2011-04-29T19:48:09+0000
