The heroine of Gibson's seventh novel is Cayce Pollard, a ''coolhunter'' hired by advertisers to penetrate happening neighborhoods in search of the next big thing. An assignment to track down the creator of a mysterious series of film clips that have gained a cult following on the Net sends her from London to Tokyo; along the way, she pursues a secret quest: to find out what happened to her father, a retired C.I.A. man who vanished in New York on Sept. 11, 2001. ''Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture,'' Lisa Zeidner said here in 2003.

us,Make It Nouveau,"Two sights define Paris: the Eiffel Tower and the entrances for the Mtro, some of which have disappeared into museums and collections over the past few decades. Between 1900 and 1904 Hector Guimard produced the subway's marquees and railings, stunning gems of art nouveau, the sinuously curvilinear design style inspired by nature that became the dominant international architectural, furniture, and graphic movement from the mid-1890's until just before World War I. Guimard was the movement's most inventive proponent, probably the most prolific in any medium, and decidedly the most eccentric, given the excessive floriated madness that characterizes even his most simplified creations. Although some of the exquisitely decorative work in wood, metal, ceramic, and stone has been destroyed, enough has been preserved to illustrate the beautifully produced HECTOR GUIMARD: Architect, Designer 1867/1942 (Delano Greenidge Editions, $85). Through color photographs of buildings and details, as well as painstakingly researched original drawings, sketches, blueprints and other historical documentation related to the design of everything from intricate banisters and window frames to innovative cemetery memorials to casts of building numbers, Guimard's style is not just resurrected from the past but made to appear almost new.

Former member of the Board of Directors and Executive Vice President of the Prudential Insurance Company, responsible for all sales activities, group insurance and group annuities, and planning and development, died on Monday, at a rehabilitation facility in Jupiter, FL. He was 84. A 1940 graduate of Harvard University, he began his career as an actuary with the Prudential where he met his wife to be, Rita Emmett. During WWII he served for four years in the US Army Air Corps as a navigator, rising to captain. After returning to the Prudential, in the words of former president Orville Beal, ''Bob Harvey had moved out of the Actuarial Department into Administration. Then I chose him to succeed me as head of sales operations for Prudential. That's quite unusual--to have an actuary as head of sales-but he was that kind of man-highly respected by everybody.'' Then came ''a very heavy blow.'' Near the top of the company, Harvey's career ended in 1967 following a tragic automobile accident. Beyond his activities in the insurance business, he served as Chairman, Scholarship Committee of Harvard; President, Health and Hospital Council of Newark and vicinity; and member, Boards of Directors, Life Office Management Association, Welfare Federation of Newark, and United Community Corporation (Newark). As part of his civic activities, Mr. Harvey worked closely with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. on what he found to be ''one of the most stimulating and potentially rewarding fields of all,'' assisting urban youth in Newark. A man of admirable strength and perseverance, in the accident's aftermath he maintained his uncanny intelligence and wit along with love and care for his family. Besides his wife he is survied by his daughter and son-inlaw, Judy and John McCormack, and son-in-law Joseph McNamara, all of New Jersey, five grandchildren, brother-in-law and sister-inlaw Robert and Lynn Emmett, and two nephews.

In his new play, ''Valhalla,'' which opens on Thursday at New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, Mr. Rudnick brings that sensibility to a new realm, literally: ''Valhalla'' stars Peter Frechette as mad King Ludwig of Bavaria, the notoriously insatiable aesthete who in the mid-1800's bankrupted his treasury by building (among other follies now adored) fairy-tale castles, underground grottoes and the Festspielhaus at Bayreuth. In his own mad castle -- a downtown loft so encrusted with Gothic froufrou you would not be surprised if King Ludwig himself were the decorator -- I spoke to Mr. Rudnick about recent developments in gay theater, and his role in it.

Kaplan, 82, was the quintessential ''Deli Man,'' creating Kaplan's at the Delmonico Delicatessen-Restaurant on 59th Street in New York, Jack Kaplan's on West 47th Street, and Kaplan's Olde New York on Broad Street in the late 1970s and early 1980s. An instant hit with jaded New Yorkers, international visitors, and celebrities alike, Kaplan's became one of the city's top delis in its heyday, serving up generous portions of corned beef, pastrami and Jack Kaplan's own gregarious, boisterous humor, as he greeted customers in his trademark red suspenders. Born in Brooklyn in 1921, Kaplan graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1937, and attended City College with dreams of teaching mathematics, before joining the Army Air Force in 1942. A Purple Heart veteran of World War II, Kaplan was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Eighth Air Force, navigating B24s out of Wendling, England. On his 18th mission, he was shot down over Germany during the ''Maximum Effort'' Gotha raid on February 24, 1944, and served out the remainder of the war as a POW at Stalag Luft I in Barth, Germany. After returning to the U.S. Kaplan met his future wife Lee and they married in 1947, he formed what would become a 30-year business partnership with his brother Howard Kaplan and brother-in-law Aaron Stein, transforming candy stores into bustling luncheonettes in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. They opened restaurants at the Barbizon Hotel for Women at 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue in New York from 1964 to 1976. Kaplan went solo with the Kaplan's Delicatessen-Restaurants, which he launched with his wife Lee in 1977. In his retirement, mourned by deli - lovers throughout the world, Kaplan volunteered in the New York City Public Schools, the Beth Israel Hospice Program, and the Temple Emanu-El lunch program for the homeless. Kaplan is survived by his wife Lee Kaplan; daughters Marcy Kaplan of Downers Grove, IL; Debby Kaplan (Francis Keenan) of New York; Cindy Kaplan Rooney (Stephen P. Rooney) of Montclair, NJ; grandson Stephen Charles Kaplan Rooney; granddaughters Ava Pat Kaplan Rooney and Nellie Bowe Kaplan Keenan; sister Felice Stein and brother Howard Kaplan, both of New York. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, February 1, at 11 a.m. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street.

Rothman, a Democrat from Bergen County, said last week. The Federal Aviation Agency had proposed lifting a 37-year old ban on overweight planes at Teterboro, a move that prompted concern and anger in the densely populated towns around the airport. Legislation drafted by Mr. Rothman to keep the ban became part of the annual appropriations bill in Congress. That passed the House in December and passed the Senate last month, with the support of New Jersey's Democratic senators, Jon Corzine and Frank Lautenberg. The measure will have to be renewed next year, but Mr. Rothman was confident a precedent had been set. ''We don't want your jumbo jets in our backyards and we never will,'' he said in a statement. He was also instrumental in getting a measure passed recently permanently banning scheduled charter service at the airport. George James",2004-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Net income was 70 cents a share on sales of $385 million in the quarter that ended on Jan. 31, a spokesman, James Ankner, said yesterday.

Shipments of ''Mafia'' for Microsoft's Xbox game console and for Sony's PlayStation2 in Europe were delayed until this quarter, Take-Two said. Also, holiday sales of games ''Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne'' lagged forecasts, and there were costs for bad debt from KB Toys, which has requested bankruptcy protection, Take-Two said. Take-Two shares rose 73 cents, to $29.73.

The change applies to orders placed online and customers who buy certain other services, like local and long-distance calling. The lower price will still apply when customers buy a range of services that include wireless calling. SBC cut the prices last quarter to extend the company's lead in DSL. The discounts ended to help fulfill a pledge by the chief executive, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., to stem profit-margin declines this year. Shares of SBC rose 96 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $26.46. At the end of last year, SBC had 3.5 million so-called digital subscriber lines, which let customers download information more quickly than dial-up connections.

Ciba -- which is based in Basel and makes plastics, car paints and textiles -- said profit for the year was down 15 percent, to 344 million Swiss francs, while sales were down 6 percent, to 6.65 billion francs. Analysts said the figures were below expectations, and the share price fell 2 percent. The chief executive, Armin Meyer, said Ciba had done its homework by cutting costs. Those cuts included expenses of a 2 percent reduction of the work force, but Mr. Meyer said the company's results would pick up only when market conditions improved. Despite a tough year, Ciba said it cut its debt 28 percent and had cash reserves of 728 million francs. He said Ciba was considering 10 takeover candidates but declined to identify them.

She had recently undergone surgery for colon cancer that had spread to other vital organs of her body, according to a family spokesperson. She was 80 years old. Mrs. Kayes was born in Chicago, where her father, Cecil Elmes, an Englishman who had become an American citizen, headed a firm of engineering consultants. When her family moved to New York City, she was enrolled at the Nightingale-Bamford School and subsequently on graduation, Vassar College. Her collegiate studies ended when the Women's Air Force Service Pilots lowered its age limit and she promptly withdrew from Vassar to join the volunteer organization headed by Jacqueline Cochrane. Mrs. Kayes entered the WASP as a licensed aviation pilot. At the age of fifteen she had begun taking flying lessons in Sarasota, where her parents had a winter home, and she joined the WASP as a qualified flight pilot and instructor. In addition to her duties as a flight instructor, she piloted B-26s on target towing missions during gunnery practice for Air Force and Navy student pilots, remaining with the WASP until it was disbanded shortly before the end of the war. In later years Mrs. Kayes, a member of the New York Junior League, served as its vice-president and was actively involved in its volunteer social work programs. In addition to participating in its annual Mardi Gras fundraising events as a Beauty Queen, she focused on the activities of the Women's Prison Association, where she served as a member of its board of directors and as president of the organization. Despite her commitment to volunteer social service work and the rigorous task of raising 3 children as a divorced single mother, Mrs. Kayes had a professional career as Cecily Crawford in residental real estate in New York City. Her specialty was cooperative apartment sales, and she had a long association with the firm of Kenneth Ives, which was subsequently merged into the Douglas Elliman organization. Surviving are 3 children by her marriage to James W. Crawford: James W. Crawford III of New Berlin, WI, Lillian Aronow of Coconut Grove, FL, Elizabeth Crawford of Lambertville, NJ, 7 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. Her husband, Alan Kayes, a longtime resident of Water Mill and Southampton, who now resides at Peconic Landing in Greenport, NY also survives.

For the year, Serono said profit rose 22 percent, to $390 million, and sales rose by a greater-than-expected 31 percent, but its share price declined more than 2 percent because of a cautious forecast for 2004. Andrew Fellows, an analyst for Pictet & Cie, said that investors were disappointed because Serono did not appear to be coming up with enough new products and that growth prospects for its rivals in the United States appeared to be better.

The original building was destroyed in the trade center attack. Although Mr. Silverstein has been at odds with Industrial Risk Insurers over the value of the property, he has started building a $700 million skyscraper on the site, at Washington and Vesey Streets.

Mr. Barr has published poetry but is known mainly as a businessman and investment banker with the firm SG Barr Devlin, which handles mergers and acquisitions that sometimes exceed the billion-dollar level. Before becoming a co-founder of the firm in 1990, he was a managing director at Morgan Stanley. Financial dealing, however, does not take all of Mr. Barr's attention. He is also on the boards of Bennington College and the Yaddo art colony. The Chicago-based Poetry Foundation was for years a respected but decidedly low-budget operation known as the Modern Poetry Association. It announced its huge gift from the pharmaceutical heiress Ruth Lilly in November 2002 and changed its name soon afterward. A large part of Mr. Barr's role will be to decide how to use the money. ''This is a chance for me to combine and create a point of conjunction for what have been the two principal paths of my life, writing poetry and being a businessman,'' Mr. Barr said. ''I dream of seeing the Poetry Foundation built and operated like a well-run company. The business purpose is to make an important home for American poetry, but I also hope to set an example by making this run well from a business point of view.''

Nestl bought the Brazilian company, at the time one of the largest chocolate makers in the country, for $230 million two years ago. Analysts expected the agency to approve the sale with some conditions, allowing Nestl to overtake Kraft Foods as the market leader in Brazil. ''It wasn't the decision we expected,'' said Ivan Zurita, chairman of the Brazilian operations of Nestl. Kraft and Cadbury Schweppes of Britain, which lost out to Nestl in the original bidding, had lobbied the government agency to block the deal. Kraft cannot buy Garoto because it already has a market share of more than 20 percent, but the ruling could lead to a second chance for Cadbury to enter the Brazilian market.

It is unclear whether Mr. Simmons shot himself before the police arrived or after the tear gas was used, the police said. The police had identified Mr. Simmons as one of two men who opened fire in the Galaxy Diner in East New York on Jan. 17, sending customers diving under tables for cover before taking jewelry and money and fleeing. Another suspect, Mark Blount of East New York, was arrested the following week. The police are seeking a third suspect, possibly a driver, an investigator said.

The problem, according to the transit agency, is that some gates along the line are getting stuck in the down position during trial runs. In addition, since there has to be a weeklong stretch of test runs with no problems, the severe weather has not given the agency a sufficient window to complete the tasks. The River Line, whose cost has amounted to nearly $1 billion, has been criticized as unnecessary and overly expensive. New Jersey Transit estimates that when the line opens, it will carry 5,700 passengers a day, operating every 15 minutes at rush hour and every 30 minutes at other times on the 34-mile route. Initial fares will be $1.10 each way. But because the line will use the same tracks as freight trains, it will operate only between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. For now, New Jersey Transit estimates that the River Line will operate at a deficit of $75 million a year.

And he will almost surely be asked about his service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War, an issue that Democrats are using to draw a distinction with their front-runner, Senator John Kerry, a decorated war hero. If nothing else, his appearance shows that Mr. Bush, who so far has tried to hold himself above the political fray, is starting to act like a candidate. Richard W. Stevenson",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

The more time passes, the more it appears that both arguments were wrong. Not only are the weapons probably not there, but a decade of international import restrictions, United Nations arms inspections and United States military deterrence look far more effective than once thought. That is a crucial lesson for Americans to digest at a time when other countries dream of building biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and when the risks of waging preventive war on the basis of faulty intelligence have become so starkly evident.",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

Now 57, he has long since left performance behind to make sculptures that are discourses on military might, ominous models of overbuilt civilizations and experiments with art and technology. His current exhibition, at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, is his first New York solo show since 1996. It includes recent work from a series of large-scale model bridges, made from originals and replicas of Erector-set parts, that he's been working on since 1997.

us,Cotton-Picking Aryans,"Just when you thought you'd investigated the American experience of World War II from every angle imaginable, along comes Steve Yarbrough with his fine third novel, PRISONERS OF WAR (Knopf, $23), the story of a makeshift German P.O.W. camp built in the Mississippi Delta in the summer of 1943. Well before the captured Germans arrive to pick cotton for local farmers, the inhabitants of Loring, Miss., past and present, have struggled against the complex terrors of war. It has roiled not just the lives of the boys off fighting, but those impatient to be, those who dodged and those who returned disillusioned or demented, as good as dead. Without neglecting the requisite small-town stragglers in this richly populous novel -- the aging sexpots and spinster telephone operators, the small-fry entrepreneurs and smarmy draft board officers -- Yarbrough writes with quiet compassion about Loring's black population, its reluctance to fight for a country that has so consistently betrayed its democratic promise. To this combustible setting will come a peculiar prisoner, one with an ''angry purple stain, either a birthmark or a rash,'' who speaks broken English and haunts one of the Loring natives assigned to guard him. It is the fate of this mysterious captive that once again forces the people of Loring to confront what it means to be American, and all the unexpected -- and often unwarranted -- sacrifices that identity might comprise.

us,A Stone of Hope," In his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C., in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. said that he was going back to the South with faith that his people could hew ""a stone of hope"" from ""a mountain of despair."" That image captures the philosophy of the civil rights movement. The faith that drove black southern protesters to their extraordinary victories in the mid-1960s, this book argues, grew out of a realistic understanding of the typically dim prospects for social justice in this world. Despair was the mountain. Hope was by comparison small, hard to come by. ""Freedom isn't free,"" one of the movement's songs observed: ""You gotta pay a price, you gotta sacrifice, for your liberty."" In another one of his 1963 speeches King said that the jailed black children of Birmingham were ""carving a tunnel of hope through the mountain of despair."" ",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

He spent his entire career in the Specialty Food Business, including President and Chairman of Louis Sherry, Senior Vice President of Norin Corporation, Founder and President of Iroquois Grocery Products, Executive Vice President and the President of Iroquois Brands, where he made the acquisition of Romanoff Caviar from Colgate Palmolive.

us,The Sound,"In 1966, the jangle of a 12-string Rickenbacker electric guitar or the resonating overtones of a sitar made clear that today had replaced yesterday. In 1978, a pumping 4/4 beat and squeaky strings watermarked the music. In 1985, a comically large snare drum told the time. What typifies Right Now in 2004 are the sharp beats of three producers from the Virginia Beach area: Timothy (Timbaland) Mosley, 32, and the Neptunes, a k a Pharrell Williams, 30, and Chad Hugo, 29. Turn on any pop radio station in America and you'll hear their work. The song may be nominally pop or R&B, but you'll hear a genetic link to hip-hop. The surface is shiny and the beats are proudly digital, articulated to the point of restlessness. The melodies are flecked with eruptions of the mechanical, as if NASA were hacking the signal.

us,"A Cold War Battle, Fought on the Ice","THE canon of watchable or even semi-watchable hockey movies is pitifully small: ''Slapshot,'' ''Youngblood'' (a now forgotten Rob Lowe vehicle that was part teen romance and part coming-of-age story, about learning to drop your gloves and throw some punches out there on the ice), the three installments of the ''Mighty Ducks'' saga, ''Mystery, Alaska'' and just a few others. These movies, like sports movies in general, divide into two categories, or sometimes vibrate between them. There are the earnest, uplifting movies -- the ones that celebrate hard work, team spirit and the importance of staying faithful to one's dream. And then there are the movies, often funny and raunchy, that try to tell the truth, and to convey some sense of what athletes who play team sports are really like. Fans of this second kind of movie -- and hockey purists especially -- are apt to have mixed feelings about ''Miracle,'' which is only partly a hockey flick. Inevitably, it's also a flag-waving tearjerker about the last great battle of the cold war -- the one at Lake Placid in 1980, in which a bunch of clean-cut American college kids beat the grizzled lifers from the Soviet Union, restoring our national pride and striking a liberating blow against the entire Soviet athletic system.",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

I realize this is irrational -- there's no rule that says the Super Bowl show must honor America's soldiers at war. But that halftime show has become a kind of national moment and the grotesque way it came out really captured what has bothered me most about how this war is being conducted: The whole burden is being borne by a small cadre of Americans -- the soldiers, their families and reservists -- and the rest of us are just sailing along, as if it has nothing to do with us.",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"No Running Away, Either","Paul Fleischman's story THE ANIMAL HEDGE (Candlewick, $16.99; ages 5 to 9) is as simple as a folk song. Its illustrator, the Russian-born Bagram Ibatoulline, has followed the style of American folk painters of the 18th and early 19th centuries, and the result is as haunting as a loved melody. As the book opens, a farmer lives with his three sons in a peaceable kingdom of cows and chickens, pigs and sheep. His heart ''glowed like a hot wood stove'' with the love of animals; he and his boys sang as they worked. This idyll appears in ovals of color, set in sepia frames adorned with folk motifs, like a songbook or the pages of a family album. Then a drought comes. The pictures now glow with terrible heat, the animals' ribs show, and a heartbreaking little pig peers hopelessly at the bottom of a dry and empty wooden basin. The farmer is desolated; by the time rain and new growth return to the land, he has lost almost everything; the animals are gone, and the farmer has no money to buy more. He and his sons live in a tiny cottage, sharpening tools for a living. One day, preparing to trim his rough hedge, the farmer seems to discern the shapes of his vanished animals in his hedge and clips it to bring out their forms. Soon he is surrounded by green leafy cows, goats and sheep. The sweet and solemn story circles around until the farmer has back what was lost, the same but changed. The illustrations, apparently artless, are uncannily beautiful, filled with light and feeling. Beth Gutcheon",2004-02-08T05:00:00+0000

But first, Eurotunnel wants its financial and industrial partners, including its banks, to help it shore up its balance sheet, which lists 9 billion euros of debt left over from its construction and delayed opening. Eurotunnel posted a net loss of 1.89 billion euros as a weak economy and a price war with ferry services battered its operating results.",2004-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Even though more than 90 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United States, Mexico's recovery has lagged that of the United States. But the figures for December exports suggest that the economy may finally be starting to rebound. Exports rose 11.2 percent, to $14.9 billion, in the last month of 2003.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled that a federal judge in North Carolina incorrectly interpreted patents related to on-screen TV program guides. The judge had ruled that EchoStar, Hughes Electronics' DirecTV unit and Thomson's consumer electronics division did not infringe the patents. Gemstar settled a patent suit with Thomson last year and reached an agreement to license the program technology for Thomson's RCA and General Electric televisions. It also settled a dispute with TiVo Inc. The appeals court ordered the EchoStar case returned to the trial judge for reconsideration. The ruling came on the same day that Gemstar said it settled consolidated shareholder lawsuits for $67.5 million: $42.5 million in cash and the issuance of 4.1 million shares at $6.09 each.",2004-02-13T05:00:00+0000

One tip for visitors: if the combination of the high altitude and the high-quality beers sold at many of the town's restaurants and bars proves to be a debilitating combination, take advantage of the town's free bus shuttle that operates every 20 minutes from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. each day.

Passengers began using the spartan, temporary, open-air station on Nov. 23, after more than two years of having to find other ways to get between New Jersey and Lower Manhattan.

us,The Man Who Could Carve Tears,"In 1784, when Thomas Jefferson arrived in Paris to help represent the fledgling American republic, one of his missions was to locate a sculptor to create a statue of George Washington. Jefferson recommended Jean-Antoine Houdon: ''I find that a Monsieur Houdon of this place possesses the reputation of being the first statuary in the world.'' Houdon (1741-1828) was already widely recognized as the greatest European sculptor of his age. His remarkable career, which spanned the Enlightenment, both the American and the French revolutions, and the Directory and the Napoleonic era in France, is the subject of the essays by Anne L. Poulet, an emeritus curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and others in JEAN-ANTOINE HOUDON: Sculptor of the Enlightenment (University of Chicago, $85). They detail Houdon's artistic development and provide insights into his working methods and his relationships with his subjects, a group that included Molire, Diderot, Voltaire, Franklin and Napoleon. Houdon was obsessive in his attention to muscle and bone structure, using calipers to measure his sitters' features. He could do teeth, the pupils of the eyes, soft dimples, even tears; details that, two centuries later, still catch the breath. In 1783, a critic said of Houdon's portrait busts of contemporary celebrities: ''M. Houdon lacks only the means to make his portraits speak, since, as for likeness, he lacks nothing.''

At Christmas, Kim surprised him by sending back a plush-toy version of Wage, about a foot high, that she had sewn herself. Horvath was so excited that he showed it off to Eric Nakamura, the owner of a store in Los Angeles called Giant Robot, which sold art books and magazines as well as toys and T-shirts made by artists.

us,The Closing of the Western Mind," Amonk in the black-and-white habit of the Dominicans sits in a niche set within an elaborate columned edifice crowned by a vault. Carved on the panels either side of him are fasces, rods bound together, a symbol of authority that reaches back through the history of ancient Rome to the Etruscans. Conventionally, as those who are attuned to the more sinister aspects of modern European history will be all too well aware, an axe is fixed within the bundle, but here it is omitted and the fasces are lit. Even in ancient times the presence of the axe was associated with tyrannical authority, so the omission suggests a deliberate attempt to evoke an authority that is benign rather than menacing. A setting in Rome is confirmed by the views behind the imposing structure. On one side there is part of St. John Lateran, the cathedral church of Rome, fronted by an equestrian statue believed in the 1480s, the date of this fresco, to be of the emperor Constantine, its founder. On the other is the Porta Ripa Grande, the port alongside the river Tiber in Rome. The fresco itself is in the Carafa Chapel in Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, a Dominican church in the city. Even if the fasces are not menacing, one aspect of the fresco nevertheless is. The monk crushes a scowling old man beneath his feet. The old man is a personification of evil, and he clutches a banner with the Latin inscription ""Wisdom conquers evil."" The monk himself is none other than the great Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-74). Above him in a roundel are the verses from the Book of Proverbs with which he chose to begin one of his finest works, the Summa contra gentiles, ""a summary of the case against the heretics"": ""For my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips."" Also above him, on panels held by putti, appears a declaration of the importance of the revealed word of God: ""The revelation of Thy words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple."" The most important text, however, must be that which Thomas has selected to hold in his left hand; it is from the Apostle Paul, sapientiam sapientum perdam, ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise."" As this book will suggest, the phrase, supported by other texts of Paul which condemn the ""empty logic of the philosophers,"" was the opening shot in the enduring war between Christianity and science.

Waterfowl and wildlife were abundant, offering hunters as rich a harvest as that gathered by those who cultivated the land.

The United States government dispatches an agent, a former ambassador, to an African country that is rumored to be selling uranium to a crazy dictator. The diplomat reports that the rumors are unfounded, much to the annoyance of his superiors, and shortly afterward his wife, a spy for the C.I.A., is outed. Meanwhile, over in England, a scientist has quietly been questioning his government's assessment of the mad dictator's threat. A few days later he turns up dead in a remote country lane, his wrist cut, a packet of pills by his side.

The motivations for running away are no mystery; however, in many cases the methods of escape remain unknown even to this day. Despite stepped-up efforts in Maryland and other southern states to thwart escapes during the ten years before the Civil War, some slaves did marshal the strength and courage to take their liberty. But few returned to the land of their enslavers, risking capture and reenslavement, even lynching, to help others seek their own emancipation. ",2004-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The New Golden Age of Acting,"IN his review of Patty Jenkins's ''Monster,'' Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times declared that Charlize Theron's performance as the executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos, for which Ms. Theron has since been nominated for an Oscar, was ''one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema.'' Such hyperbole on the part of a critic is always apt to raise an eyebrow or two -- not least among other critics -- but in this case my own brows are not budging. This is partly because I, too, admire Ms. Theron's work in ''Monster'' -- her intensity, her empathy and her ferocious dedication to expunging all vanity or irony from her performance. But it is also because for me to mock such a grand historical claim would be blatantly hypocritical. A few months before Mr. Ebert unleashed his praise on Ms. Theron, I was similarly extravagant in heralding the achievement of one of her fellow nominees, when I called Sean Penn's portrayal of Jimmy Markum in Clint Eastwood's ''Mystic River'' one of the definitive pieces of screen acting in the last half-century.",2004-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Paths of Desire," One day, soon after we had moved into the house, I walked out the back door from the kitchen and saw a couple of mysterious plants poking, with great determination, their way out from the edge of the driveway. Fugitives from a buried bed. I had never seen such plants in my life. Two strong stalks of dusty green with thick leaves ranked up the sides, they grew taller and taller - I felt like Jack watching his beans rise - until they reached a height of five feet. The stalks were noble and erect, as if they were flagpoles from which would unfurl heraldic banners. Then the stalks began to bloom, a profusion of blossoms up and down their length of a mottled, breathtaking, unnameable blue. A Botticelli blue. A blue close to the clearest depths of southern seas, or the celestial orbs frescoed on the ceilings of old churches. And then again, a blue that lay closer to the inky mauve of a slow dusk. The color was shifting, changeable. This was my introduction to the aristocratic delphinium. For years afterward, I searched the garden catalogs to find a flower that resembled the ones that seemed to have come down to my backyard from the heavens; I figured out that they were a hybrid of the elatum group, but I have faltered in finding the color, which hovers elusively, winking at me, somewhere between the ""Blue Nile"" and ""Bruce."" It is like that blue spot in the middle of the darkness behind your eyeballs, the so-called Blue Pearl at the heart of meditation, that the seeker finds only upon transcending time and place and the need to scratch an itch. I have read about it, but will never find it. I had seen the mythic delphinium; I was soon to lose it forever. Those flowers that appeared at the back of the driveway came bearing a message, I was sure. It was time to start a new bed in the back. That was how we came to rip out the parking lot.

us,Everyone Else Must Fail," The saying ""It is not sufficient that I succeed. Everyone else must fail"" has been associated with Larry Ellison so often that most people think it originated with him. Actually, it came centuries ago with Genghis Khan. Ellison has referred to the quote in conversations, then laughed rather unconvincingly and tried to distance himself from the sentiment. But it sticks nonetheless. For Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle Corporation, is like a modern-day Genghis Khan who has elevated ruthlessness in business to a carefully cultivated art form. His weapons are not the marauding hordes but his company's possession of a key technology platform, his willingness to exploit it, and his disdain for anyone who gets in his way. That includes subordinates, whom Ellison runs through and discards with unusual ferocity. He cannot tolerate executives who dare to stand up to him and has systematically purged Oracle's senior ranks of much of their talent. Many of the departed, among them Tom Siebel and Craig Conway, are running Oracle competitors, while others, such as Ray Lane, have notable second careers. But Oracle remains in their veins. Siebel is head of Oracle competitor Siebel Systems, Conway of PeopleSoft, and, as a venture capitalist at famed investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Lane is busily searching for the next Oracle.

us,Stage Appears to Be Set for a 2-Way Race in March Primaries," MILWAUKEE, Feb. 17 - The Democratic presidential nomination battle turned into a two-person contest on Tuesday as Senator John Kerry narrowly defeated Senator John Edwards in the Wisconsin primary. Howard Dean suffered a dismal third-place showing that Democrats said would effectively end his campaign. At 10 p.m., with 72 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Kerry had 39 percent of the vote; Mr. Edwards had 35 percent; Dr. Dean 18 percent; Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio 3 percent; and the Rev. Al Sharpton 1 percent. The finish by Mr. Edwards startled Democrats here - as well as those in the Kerry and Edwards camps - who had been looking for Mr. Kerry to post another decisive victory in Wisconsin, based on his performance so far this year. And it set the stage for what Mr. Edwards said he has long wanted after trying to break through what wasonce a very crowded nomination competition: a clean two-way race with Mr. Kerry, played out over a relatively long period. ``The people of Wisconsin spoke loudly and clearly tonight,'' Mr. Edwards said in a speech. ``They want a debate. They want this campaign to continue.'' Mr. Kerry, who stepped out to give his victory speech as Mr. Edwards was speaking, knocking him off live television, made no mention of the thin margin. ``The motto of the state of Wisconsin is forward,'' said Mr. Kerry, who has now won 15 of the 17 contests. ``And I want to thank the state of Wisconsin for moving this cause and this campaign forward tonight here in this great state.'' Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, said even before the polls closed that he would continue his campaign no matter what the outcome in Wisconsin, a state he once said he had to win. ``We are not done,'' he said in his own speech on Tuesday. But leading Democrats said that in light of his latest disappointing loss, they saw little hope for his continuing as a serious candidate. And while Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards turned their attention to March 2, when there will be 10 contests, Dr. Dean prepared to head back to his home in Burlington to determine where to take his campaign from here. A critical question now, some Democrats said, is whether Dr. Dean, who has not won a single contest, withdraws from the race and throws his support to Mr. Edwards or Mr. Kerry. The survey of voters leaving the polls found that voters who said they had once intended to support Dr. Dean split evenly between Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry. Mr. Edwards's strong showing came in a state that has a maverick tradition, going back to when John F. Kennedy upset Hubert Humphrey in the 1960 Democratic presidential primary. It also came in a state where any registered voter is allowed to participate in the Democratic primary, and 40 percent of those who voted on Tuesday said they were not Democrats. As in Iowa, Mr. Edwards appears to have gained strength in the final days of the campaign, in what many Democrats said was a testament to strong campaign skills. He won the endorsement of the state's two major newspapers here. And not incidentally, several Democrats said, he might have benefited from what had been Dr. Dean's central message, as he urged voters here not to rubber-stamp the Kerry nomination, and allow the process to continue. ``Everyone I talk to, conservatives and liberals, say we want to keep it going at least until sometime in March,'' said Mary Citizen, 59, who lives in West Bend and was waving a flag at Dr. Dean's election-night party in a Madison hotel. ``Every time these guys get up on a stage they're throwing ideas at us. We're still shopping. It's not a done deal.'' Mr. Edwards's aides expressed confidence that the jolt of excitement that would accompany his second-place showing would bring him enough favorable publicity to help compensate for any financial advantage Mr. Kerry might have. They argued that this two-week period would allow Mr. Edwards to capitalize on what his aides have long argued are misgivings among Democrats about Mr. Kerry, and give voters more time to get acquainted with Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards won the support of 50 percent of the Democrats who say they made up their minds over the last three days, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls. And should the race go on until March 9, Mr. Edwards of North Carolina will be competing with Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts in five Southern states. ``We've been saying all along that voters are still looking for a choice,'' said David Ginsberg, Mr. Edwards's communications director. ``It's a pretty good thing to have a candidate that the more they see him, the more they like him.'' Mr. Kerry's advisers noted that Mr. Edwards had so far won only in the state of his birth, South Carolina, and expressed doubt that he could catch up. Before Tuesday, party leaders from across the nation had been urging Democrats to coalesce around Mr. Kerry as the party's likely nominee. And they noted that in Wisconsin, any registered voter is permitted to vote in the Democratic primary; 10 percent of the electorate here on Tuesday said they were Republicans, and 40 percent of them voted for Mr. Edwards, suggesting that the results here should not be seen as an indication of any general dissatisfaction among Democrats with Mr. Kerry. Still, the developments here on Tuesday signaled that a race that many Democrats had seen as all but over would roll on - at least into March. And while Mr. Kerry would appear in some ways to have a lopsided advantage over Mr. Edwards - before Tuesday, he had 448 delegates compared with 161 for Mr. Edwards - the result in a swing state in a general election seems certain to raise questions about the central claim of Mr. Kerry's campaign: that he is the strongest Democrat the party has to send up against Mr. Bush. Mr. Edwards's showing came as a surprise both because Mr. Kerry had swamped him in state after state and because a series of pre-primary polls showed Mr. Kerry with a large lead. Because of the open primary, Wisconsin is a difficult state to poll. Still, the practical result was that anything less than a substantial victory by Mr. Kerry could be portrayed by his opponents as a setback, which is what was happening throughout the day as the campaigns got early glimpses of the results of surveys of voters leaving the polls. Mr. Edwards suggested in an interview this week that Mr. Kerry's run of victories was a function of his riding the wave of support created by his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, and that his standing would erode under the scrutiny of Democratic voters. He argued that he tended to grow in strength the more time he spent in a state, as was the case here. That said, Mr. Edwards has only South Carolina, despite a substantial investment of time and money elsewhere and what many Democrats describe as extraordinary skills as a candidate. Tuesday's contest was the sixth in which he placed second; he has come in fourth seven times. And Mr. Kerry's advisers scoffed at the notion that Mr. Edwards had a legitimate claim on being part of two-person contest. ``I don't see this as a two-person race because we're running against someone who has won one state,'' one senior Kerry adviser said. ``This whole idea that you sort of cherry-pick the states you are going to compete in - that's a vanity game, it's not a real game.'' Mr. Kerry said Tuesday, before the polls closed, that he would campaign aggressively across the nation. ``I'm not selectively picking one state or another to wage my campaign in,'' he said. ``I'm waging my campaign all across the country in all states.'' The survey of voters leaving the polls found that in Wisconsin, as almost everywhere else this year, voters were looking for a strong challenger to Mr. Bush. Mr. Kerry did best with those for whom electability was most important - getting 70 percent of their support. Mr. Edwards drew the support of about 45 percent of those who said caring was the most important quality, compared to about a third for Mr. Kerry. The survey of voters leaving the polling places throughout the state was conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for the television networks and The Associated Press. In Madison on Tuesday, Mary Crave, 47, an adult education teacher, said she voted for Mr. Kerry. ``He's the most electable,'' she said. ``I like Edwards, but I don't think he's ready yet to gather the troops. I'm sort of an anybody-but-Bush voter.'' Steven Kleiss, 36, a banker - said he voted for Mr. Edwards. ``He stayed the most consistent throughout the debates and the race,'' Mr. Kleiss said. `` It seems like the other candidates have shifted based on what's popular, but he stayed on message better.'' Vicki Webster, 57, a medical records clerk from Madison, said she considered voting for Mr. Kerry, but went with Dr. Dean after deciding that Mr. Kerry seemed ``too aloof.'' ``Howard Dean seems more down to earth,'' she said.

Cattle were once sold mainly at cash auctions to bidders who included buyers from different packing plants. But there are virtually no independent packers left. Four companies -- the three largest are named in this suit -- now control 82 percent of the slaughter market, up from 36 percent in 1980.

At the company's annual meeting yesterday in Wilmington, Del., shareholders voted to have each director face re-election annually, beginning in 2005. One-year terms give shareholders more authority by letting them evaluate directors each year, the chief executive, Patricia F. Russo, said. Lucent's 11 directors had served three-year terms that were staggered so that three or four director posts were up for election each year. Shareholders also gave the board the authority to conduct a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-5 to as much as 1-for-30. Directors may consider the reverse split as a way to reduce administrative costs relating to the company's 4.2 billion common shares and to raise the share price, which could make the shares more attractive to institutional investors, Ms. Russo said. The board won the right for a reverse split of shares at last year's meeting, but did not carry it out. At the time, the company wanted to make sure shares remained above $1, after they dipped as low as 55 cents in October 2002. Shares of Lucent fell 8 cents, or 2 percent, to $4.20.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the settlement on Friday, denied that claim. Bonnie Bellow, a spokeswoman for the agency, said yesterday that the settlement was a better way to bring about a cleanup than extensive litigation. Under the settlement, the Occidental Chemical Corporation and its affiliates agreed to pay for a study of industrial contaminants, including cancer-causing dioxins, in Newark Bay at an estimated cost of $7 million to $10 million. The settlement came just three days before the two environmental groups, New York/New Jersey Baykeeper and the Hackensack Riverkeeper, said they planned to sue.

The suit is one of just a handful of countersuits. Even critics of the recording industry view the suit as a long shot but one worth trying, and as a sign that lawyers are working on arguments against the recording association. Through her lawyers, Ms. Scimeca contends that by suing file swappers for copyright infringement, then offering to settle instead of pursuing a case in which liability could reach into hundreds of thousands of dollars, the association is violating the laws that are more typically applied to gangsters and organized crime. According to the association, which filed its latest round of lawsuits against 531 as-yet-anonymous individuals on Tuesday, it has settled with 381 people, including some who had not yet actually had suits filed against them.

Running through Sept. 19 at Mies van der Rohe's framed glass and steel New National Gallery, the exhibition, ''MoMA in Berlin,'' includes ''Starry Night'' by van Gogh, ''The Dance'' by Matisse and ''Drowning Girl'' by Roy Lichtenstein. Among other artists represented in the event, whose honorary patrons are Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, are Picasso, Hopper, Mir, Dal, O'Keeffe and Pollock. ''This exhibition shows what Berlin might have become without Adolf Hitler, without the banning of so-called degenerate art, without the East German ghetto,'' Peter-Klaus Schuster, the director of the New National Gallery, said at a news conference yesterday. German and American organizers depicted the display of painting and sculpture not only as the year's cultural highlight in Germany but also as a special gesture of trans-Atlantic friendship between their countries after tensions over the war in Iraq and as a symbol of Berlin's swift return to European cultural prominence. In return for the loan from the Museum of Modern Art, which is undergoing renovation, the New National Gallery will send some of its most famous Expressionist works to New York for an exhibition at the Neue Galerie from March 12 through June 7.

Yet for all its wealth of charm and sunshine, Tampa's twin city suffers a periodic identity crisis. Named in 1892 after the hometown of a Russian railroad magnate who helped develop it, St. Petersburg was long known for its Old World character as well as for the white-haired legions who occupied green benches along the streets and boulevards. In an image upgrade, the green benches were removed, and a local landmark, the ramshackle Million Dollar Pier, was torn down in 1967 and replaced in 1973 by a charmless steel and glass structure known simply as the Pier. Nearby St. Petersburg Beach took the image remaking a step farther in 1994 and officially changed its name to the more zingy St. Pete Beach. Despite these efforts to reverse the aging process, remnants of old St. Petersburg remain, including the Sunken Gardens flora sanctuary and a sleepy complex that must make the image boosters cringe: the St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club.

But the renaissance has included at least one species, according to wildlife authorities, that is most unwanted -- the notorious Amazon piranha. Environmental officials reported that a four-inch red-bellied piranha was found dead on the deck of a boat moored in the river. Paul Hale, curator of the London Aquarium, theorized that a private aquarium owner had released the fish into the Thames, where it was picked up by a sea gull that did not have a taste for it and spit it out. There seemed to be no concern that schools of piranhas could be lurking in the river. The temperature of the Thames is too cold to support the fish, though officials sent out a warning that it is illegal to release non-native species into the wild. Patrick E.

us,Experimental Fiction's Test Pilot,"David Markson is often labeled the avant-garde writer's avant-garde writer, the cult favorite of a tiny cult. David Foster Wallace called Markson's novel ''Wittgenstein's Mistress'' (1988) ''pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country'' -- for some readers, probably less high praise than a warning. But while even fans of Markson's witty, moving un-novels might admit that they're not for everyone, perhaps they should be. It helps to love poetry. Like Markson's other books, VANISHING POINT (Shoemaker & Hoard, paper, $15) strings together a series of atomic factoids about artists. ''Giacomo Puccini's fanatic addiction to duck hunting,'' reads one fragment. ''Nathaniel Hawthorne never learned which side won the Civil War,'' says another. At first, these tidbits seems random. But uneasy themes begin to build, among them the slicing intensity with which one artist critiques another (''A latrine, Baudelaire called George Sand.'') It emerges that these notes are research, the notecards of a elderly narrator called simply ''Author.'' And the facts he has compiled suggest a set of terrifying anxieties, all related to the possibility of creating lasting art. Our shadowy narrator seems to be struggling against time, and against his own material -- trying to erase his authorial presence, but leaving, despite (or because of) his best efforts, a trail of anxious footnotes in the sand. It's a structural trick that's both evocative and gimmicky. And by its conclusion, ''Vanishing Act'' emerges as an effectively eerie act of ''seminonfictional semifiction'' -- less storytelling than meditation, a musical rumination on the fear that underlies all creation.

us,Tongue And Chic,"Since we are going back to fashion, it's not absurd to wonder what's out of fashion -- the laws of cultural physics state that what's in is defined by and dependent on what's out. One fashion legend who's on the far side of chic these days is the late Romain de Tirtoff, whose initials, if you pronounce them with Parisian flair, are air-TAY, written ''Ert.'' His influence on fashion in the 20th century cannot be underestimated, even though few of his visions were ever spun into cloth. He had no ''house'' from which to work or issue fiats on the fate of hemlines. But his cover illustrations for Harper's Bazaar from 1915 to 1937 put a new spin on glamour and turned women from hausfraus into femmes fatales with the stroke of a pen. Ert was more than a fashion illustrator, in fact; he was an artist and designer as well. A man of many hats, he is often considered the father of Art Deco.",2004-02-22T05:00:00+0000

The plan, carrying a price tag of about $125 million in the next fiscal year, would also limit to 15 the number of children for whom individual caseworkers are responsible and create teams of forensically trained investigators required to respond more quickly to reports of child abuse. An independent panel overseeing the changes in the system will review the plan and either approve it or ask the state for revisions.

Ms. Landauer was the daughter of Dr. Karl Landauer, a prominent German-Jewish psychoanalyst who was one of the founders of the Frankfurt Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1933, the family had to leave Nazi Germany and established residence in Holland, where Dr. Landauer started a private practice and the Landauer children, Eva, her younger sister (Susan) and brother (Paul) resumed their schooling. It was Eva's intent to follow in the footsteps of her father as a psychoanalyst. However, all that was to change as a result of the harsh realities of the German conquest of Holland. Schooling was no longer an option for Jewish children. Eventually, Dr. Landauer, his wife Karolina, and Eva were transferred to a Dutch internment camp and later shipped to the German concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen, where Dr. Landauer died of starvation. Miraculously both Eva and her mother survived and later emigrated to the United States, where they were joined by Susan and Paul, both of whom had managed to avoid capture with the assistance of the Dutch underground. Once again the family had to start life anew. Eva was able to resume her schooling by obtaining a scholarship to Columbia University where she eventually obtained a Master's degree. Later she attended the London School of Economics on a Fulbright scholarship and also attended the Hempstead Clinic. She then returned to the United States and was able to work as a child analyst for the rest of her professional life. She became a member of The New York Freudian Society, International Psychoanalytic Association and The Association for Child Psychoanalysis where she served on the Executive Committee. In addition, she worked for the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, both at the Child Development Center and later as a valued senior clinical supervisor in the agency's Advanced Training Program. She will be greatly missed by her colleagues, students and friends, many of whom were unaware of the horrors of her past since she was never one to invoke the sympathy of others by dwelling on her personal hardships. She is survived by her sister Susan, her brother-in-law, Dr. Martin Fleishman, her sister-in-law, Joyce Landauer, her nephews Matthew and Charles Landauer and Charles' wife Susan Stafford Landauer and children, Ben and Megan Landauer.",2004-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Tasty Ways to Stay Clean,"A bath-and-body store that gained cult status in London, Lush will open in New York on Monday. Lush, in Herald Square, takes its cue from a country store, stocking a selection of handmade, preservative-free hair and skin care products (about $4 to $30) packed with a grocery list of fresh ingredients: grapes, papayas, ground almonds, olive oil, yogurt, honey and mushrooms. Handwritten signs, set amid fresh-cut soaps piled high like blocks of cheese, list each ingredient. Products are marked with use-by dates; some, like the company's Bio Fresh face masks, require refrigeration. Expiration dates run from several weeks to a little more than a year, while conventional cosmetics can last up to five years. Lush's farm-fresh approach has already caught on with several celebrities, according to the company: Julia Roberts uses the Angels on Bare Skin facial cleanser; Liv Tyler is a fan of the Mask of Magnaminty. The Manhattan store (212-564-9120) is Lush's fifth branch in the United States. There are shops in San Francisco, Boston, Washington and Los Angeles. STEPHANIE HUSZAR",2004-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Star Power,"The relationship between celebrities and Broadway shows goes both ways. Ideally, a clever bit of stunt casting will draw audiences to a show, and the right material will allow a star -- a refugee from film, television or pop music -- to establish a reputation for genuine, non-camera-enhanced acting talent. The results are hard to forecast: ''The Graduate'' suffered when it cast Lorraine Bracco, from The Sopranos, one of the most beloved shows on television, while ''Rent'' benefited from the addition of Joey Fatone, who isn't even the most famous member of N Sync, a slowly fading pop group. This spring, a new crop of stars will arrive on Broadway: Sean Combs (better known as P. Diddy), making his stage debut in a revival of ''A Raisin in the Sun''; Richard Dreyfuss and Elizabeth Berkley in ''Sly Fox,'' Alec Baldwin and Anne Heche in ''Twentieth Century,'' Ray Liotta and Frank Langella in ''Match,'' Laura Linney in ''Sight Unseen,'' Christopher Plummer in ''King Lear,'' Alfre Woodward in ''Drowning Crow'' and Alfred Molina in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' How will they and their shows fare? There's no way to predict, of course. But here's a look at the track records of some of their recent predecessors. ZACHARY PINCUS-ROTH",2004-02-22T05:00:00+0000

The back pockets are positioned and angled to make the backside appear smaller and higher; a darker rinse on the inside of the thighs makes legs seem leaner. Whiskering around the fly front is short, so hips appear narrower. And denim highlights that usually start midcalf begin above the knee, so the lower leg seems longer and thinner.

One of that generation's greatest pictures was still in the pipeline, Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull , but so was Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, which is to say, the palace of wisdom to which that decade's road of excess had led would soon come crashing down.

In my household, such emotions don't always run as high as they might: here is the response of one of the younger members of the family: ''Gag! That good-old-days stuff is so over.

us,The Da Vinci Con,"The ever-rising tide of sales of ''The Da Vinci Code'' has lifted some pretty odd boats, and none odder than the dodgy yet magisterial ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. A best seller in the 1980's, ''Grail'' is climbing the paperback charts again on the strength of its relationship to Dan Brown's thriller (which has, in turn, inspired a crop of new nonfiction books coming out this spring, from ''Breaking the Da Vinci Code'' to ''Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci Code''). ''The Da Vinci Code'' is one long chase scene in which the main characters flee a sinister Parisian policeman and an albino monk assassin, but its rudimentary suspense alone couldn't have made it a hit. At regular intervals, the book brings its pell-mell plot to a screeching halt and emits a pellet of information concerning a centuries-old conspiracy that purports to have preserved a tremendous secret about the roots of Christianity itself. This ''nonfiction'' material gives ''The Da Vinci Code'' its frisson of authenticity, and it's lifted from ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' one of the all-time great works of pop pseudohistory. But what seems increasingly clear (to cop a favorite phrase from the authors of ''Grail'') is that ''The Da Vinci Code,'' like ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' is based on a notorious hoax.",2004-02-22T05:00:00+0000

At 42, she has reason to be radiant: she runs her own jewelry business in London and is the creative director of Boucheron, where sales are up by a sparkling 86 percent. She was also nominated as Designer of the Year at the Design Museum in London. (The Apple maestro Jonathan Ive walked off with the prize.) It is all the more surprising that she has had no formal training. Her break came in 1987, when she designed her own engagement ring, which became the talk of smart West London (Kate Moss and Madonna requested commissions), and in 1995 she opened her store. Her designs are remarkable for their slinky moving parts and lushness. (The white gold ring, left, has 28 diamonds. Price on request. At Boucheron.)

Last month, as a protest, mayoral appointees to the authority's board voted against a plan to spend more than $200 million on new cars for the Metro-North line. The city is continuing to lobby against the release of funds for the purchases. It was the second time in three weeks that the mayor, who wants the M.T.A. to take over bus service in boroughs outside Manhattan that costs the city $150 million a year, accused the M.T.A. of neglecting New Yorkers. ''The M.T.A. has resisted this idea by crying poverty,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the authority, said the M.T.A. could not absorb the full cost of running the bus lines. ''We agree that we could do a better and more efficient job,'' he said, ''however we could not take over the buses without the subsidy that the city currently provides.''

The show, also starring Ned Beatty and Jason Patric, is to play three more weeks. Ms. Judd, one of the drama's major draws, will be replaced by her understudy, Kelly McAndrew. Discussing the show's future, a producer, Bill Kenwright, said, ''It is my intention to certainly perform this week and my hope that we can continue the run.'' Ms. Judd, who played the long-suffering wife, Maggie, tore a ligament in Act I in a scene that called for her to jump off a bed. Instead of landing on her feet, she fell awkwardly and tore a ligament. Citing great pain and discomfort, she left after the second act and was replaced by Ms. McAndrew in Act III. Ms. Judd missed the Wednesday matinee and Thursday evening performances, but against the advice of her doctors soldiered through all of the weekend performances except the Saturday matinee. Yesterday it was announced that Ms. Judd could not continue and would undergo surgery tomorrow. ''Cat'' received mixed reviews when it opened last October but achieved box-office success, earning around $500,000 a week for most of its run until the post-holiday slump, when the show, like many on Broadway, suffered a drop in sales.

But it has proved to be a white elephant bigger than those atop its fake Babylonian towers. The owners, Trizec Properties, are selling it to the CIM Group for around $200 million. (It was once said to be worth more than $600 million.) The CIM Group hopes to turn Hollywood and Highland around, but it faces a serious challenge. Not only did the project suffer from a dramatic downturn in the economy and initially annoy drivers with expensive parking, but it wavered between the theatrical and the tasteful: ''It looks like it was designed by some Romanians based on a postcard of Las Vegas,'' said the Los Angeles architecture critic Michael Webb. And the development largely faces away from one of the few streets in Los Angeles that has a lot of foot traffic. ''Hollywood is about its pedestrian night life,'' said Rose Apodaca Jones, the West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily and a co-owner of three popular Hollywood bars.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates the airport, will select a ferry operator later this year, a spokesman said. New York Waterway ran a ferry service to La Guardia's Marine Air Terminal, but discontinued it. The company recently submitted a proposal for the planned service, a company spokesman said last night. Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. said he hoped the service would help kill a plan to extend the N subway line to the airport, which he said would put a ''horrible, loud, noisy ugly elevated train line through the heart of a vibrant Astoria community.'' Mr. Vallone said he was told that the planned ferry service could begin by the end of the year and connect to airport buses with routes to terminals. Corey Kilgannon (NYT)",2004-02-26T05:00:00+0000

In effect, Verisign says that Icann has illegally prevented it from selling services that do not fall under Icann's purview, as it is set forth in the companies' contract. ''Our contract spells out Icann's jurisdiction, and what a registry service is, but by trying to assert that essentially every service is a registry service, it has led to delays and mission creep,'' said Tom Galvin, Verisign's vice president for government relations.

us,The Age of Shakespeare," The first task of one who sets out to write briefly on Shakespeare and his age must be to move the focus back from the life of the playhouse and say something about the greater world of national politics. One dominant concern in that world throughout the Tudor period was the precariousness of the royal succession. If this now seems a relatively remote and unimportant matter, it is worth recalling that Shakespeare's history plays, a good quarter of his entire output, dealt with anxieties, indeed with civil wars, about succession, and even portrayed the events leading up to the dubiously valid accession of Henry VII, Queen Elizabeth's grandfather. The succession was a matter of concern to everybody, not only because the monarchy then had more personal power than it has been able to keep, but because in Tudor times the whole issue was bound up inseparably with religious differences, and religion could mean war. The expansion of the empire under the Protestant Elizabeth inevitably caused conflict with Catholic Spain and allowed her the triumph over the Spanish Armada; but there were still English Catholics who had been instructed by the Pope that Elizabeth was an illegitimate usurper and that one could be forgiven for eliminating her. The plots against Elizabeth of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, and Mary's Catholic followers were a serious recurrent anxiety. ",2004-02-28T05:00:00+0000

Giuliano, a Sicilian bandit who operated from the mountains around his hometown, Montelepre, in the years after the Second World War, is such a mysterious figure, in fact, that Mr. Rosi's camera can't manage to get a good look at him. We see Giuliano first as a corpse -- face down in a sunny courtyard, two guns lying next to him -- and when, soon after, the film flashes to the beginning of his criminal career, we expect to see him more clearly, perhaps as the hero of a gangster movie. But he isn't a hero, and this isn't a gangster movie, and all we ever get are brief sightings of the man: in a long shot, or from the back, or in deep shadow.

When the film was up for Oscar consideration a second time, this time in the general competition, it scooped up four prominent nominations, including best director and best adapted screenplay. So what was not, a year ago, one the best foreign films is now one of the best films, period. One voting member said of ''City of God'': ''That itself is a real insult to our committee.

The murder investigation at the center of ''Mystic River'' is only a distraction from Sean Penn's anguished and complex performance.

us,An Eye on Appalachia,"For more than 25 years, Tim Barnwell has been keeping a close eye on the people and topography of Southern Appalachia, a region of family farms and tobacco fields, rolling hills giving way to steep mountain passes and communities that have, in their relative isolation, developed a distinctive way of life. Equipped with a 4-by-5 camera, Barnwell, who was himself raised in the area, combed the back roads of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee to find its tobacco farmers, quilt makers, ballad singers and molasses brewers not only to photograph but also to gather testimonies on a way of life that has been slow to change over the years. Yet, with the advent of new highways and new housing developments, change is the inevitable theme of THE FACE OF APPALACHIA: Portraits From the Mountain Farm (Norton, $29.95). Stirring as the more than 100 black-and-white photographs are, the book's 37 pages of interviews are equally riveting. Here you will learn a few tips on making molasses (''when it drips off in about an inch-long drop,'' it's ready), when to harvest tobacco (the cut stalk should resemble ''corn bread that's been cooked with too much baking soda''), how to avoid getting jumped on by a bear (''you never want to get below him. . . . I've seen 'em leap 12 feet at a bound even uphill and if you're below 'em, they can be on you before you know it'') and, repeatedly, the theme of independence: ''All we have is what we can make,'' says Marian Anderson, who once used leftover yarn from hosiery mills to make her hand-hooked rugs. More than a volume of photographs, ''The Face of Appalachia'' is a notable work of anthropology. Suzanne MacNeille",2004-02-29T05:00:00+0000
