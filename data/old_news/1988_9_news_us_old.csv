us,Dining Out Guide: Near Shopping and Movies,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Alo Alo ** (June 21, 1985), 1030 Third Avenue, at 61st Street (838-4343) - Alo Alo's wraparound glass walls invite people-watching after a day of shopping or an evening at the movies. This is a cheerfully noisy Italian bistro designed in the grand-cafe style. For starters, try the carpaccio of raw, marinated swordfish with vegetable and herb garnish, or the steamed and roasted vegetable plate. Among the crowd-pleasing pastas are the conchiglie alla bolognese, small shells with Bolognese sauce, mushrooms and fresh rosemary, and farfalle primavera. A good seafood choice is poached salmon with tomato coulis. Appetizers are $6 to $11, main courses $11.50 to $22. Open noon to 11:45 P.M. Friday to Sunday. Arizona 206 Cafe Diner's Journal (Dec. 26, 1986), 206 East 60th Street (838-0440) - Aficionados of blazing Southwestern cooking will appreciate the chili-stoked cuisine at this smart-looking annex to the Arizona 206 restaurant. Bleached wood, stucco and fabric-covered banquettes in desert colors provide an evocative setting for the food. The chef has created an all-day tasting menu (different each day) offering appetizer-size portions. There are some standards, however, and these include hacked smoked chicken with vegetable slaw, empanaditas (cornmeal meat pies filled with minced pork, dried apricots and spices in ancho chili sauce), and grilled vegetables with cheese. Grilled fish is also served, and marinated shrimp and chayote squash salad are sometimes on the menu. The tasting menu ranges from $4 to $12. Open noon to midnight Friday and Saturday and (beginning Sept. 11) 5 P.M. to midnight Sunday. Contrapunto * (Nov. 23, 1984), 200 East 60th Street (751-8616) - Pastas are the main attraction at Contrapunto, an informal, glass-walled restaurant a flight above street level. The menu begins with several good salad appetizers: grilled mushroom salad with garlic and olive oil, or a salad of tomato, sweet pepper, fennel and mozzarella in Tuscan olive oil. Twenty pasta dishes follow, with a small selection of seafood specials. Some recommended choices are angel-hair pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, leeks, basil and clams, and fusilli with bitter greens, Parmesan cheese, tomato, garlic, jalapeno peppers and virgin olive oil. One of the best seafood dishes is brodetto (fish stew), a carefully prepared melange of seafood and shellfish, garlic and herbs, served over angel-hair pasta. Entrees are $11.75 to $18.75. Open noon to midnight Friday to Sunday. Primola ** (Feb. 20, 1987), 1226 Second Avenue, near 65th Street (758-1775) -Primola's spare decor contrasts with the lively crowd it attracts. The extensive menu of fresh and vividly seasoned dishes is enhanced by many specials. Two that excel are the homemade ravioli filled with seasoned ricotta, spinach and herbs, and fettuccine with assorted wild mushrooms and tomato. Among the regular appetizers are sauteed sliced artichokes, and salmon marinated with fennel, red onions and capers. An impressive special entree is roasted whole sea bass for two; other good selections are grilled giant shrimp seasoned with lemon, garlic and oregano, and grilled baby snapper with balsamic vinegar sauce. Grilled quails, another special, are served with polenta. Prices at dinner are $7 to $9 for appetizers, $13 to $22.50 for entrees. Open noon to 2:30 P.M. Friday and 5 P.M. to midnight Friday to Sunday. Yellowfingers di Nuovo Diner's Journal (Sept. 4, 1987), 200 East 60th Street (751-8615) - This updated version of the old Yellowfingers has an exposed kitchen and a terrace behind glass for dining with a view of this neighborhood's busy street life. The rosemary-roasted chicken salad is highly recommended: it has still-warm pieces of white meat on fresh greens with pine nuts and sweet pepper. A special summer appetizer is a salad of fresh figs, prosciutto and Gorgonzola. Small pizzas have many toppings, incluuding tomato, buffalo mozzarella, eggplant, roasted peppers, basil and aioli. The grill turns out an appealing selection that includes swordfish with herb butter, snapper with braised greens, and roasted vegetables dressed with balsamic vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil. Appetizers are $3.50 to $9.75, pizzas $5.75 to $12.50 and grilled items $9.50 to $17.50. Open noon to 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday, noon to midnight Sunday.",1988-09-02T05:00:00+0000

The arbitrators met in Denver after a lengthy hearing that ended early yesterday morning. The deadline for United States athletes to be certified by the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee was 11 A.M. Eastern daylight time yesterday. The Olympic swimming coach, Richard Quick, said Jill Sterkel would take Myers's place in the 50-meter freestyle, an event in which Myers set a United States record at the Olympic trials in July. Janel Jorgensen will replace Myers in the 100-meter butterfly, and Dara Torres, who is an Olympic team member, will take her place in the 100-meter freestyle, another event in which Myers set an American record during the trials. ''Most of the people on the team now are my friends,'' Myers said at a news conference. ''I wish them all the best of luck. I wish I could be with them.'' Myers, of Americus, Ga., testified for 10 minutes before the arbitration panel. ''I told them the truth,'' she said. ''To my knowledge, I have not taken anabolic steroids.''

Nov. 20, 1985: Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court rules that Yonkers's housing and schools were intentionally segregated by race. A Housing Remedy Order directs the city to build 200 units of public housing and to plan additional subsidized housing. Jan. 28, 1988: City Council approves consent decree that sets timetable for building 200 units of public housing and commits city to an additional 800 subsidized units. July 26: Court sets Aug. 1 deadline for Council to adopt zoning amendment needed to build the 800 units. Aug. 1: Council rejects amendment in a 4-3 vote. Aug. 2: Judge Sand finds city and the four Council members who voted against the amendment in contempt of court and imposes fines. The city's fines start at $100 and double daily. The Councilmen are fined $500 a day. Aug. 9: Fines are suspended by a Federal appeals panel while the contempt ruling is appealed. Aug. 26: Appeals panel upholds contempt ruling and fines against Councilmen, but caps fines against city at $1 million a day. The fines remain suspended so city can appeal to Supreme Court. Sept. 1: Supreme Court refuses to grant city a further suspension of fines, but does continue stay of fines against Councilmen so they can seek high court's review of their contempt rulings. The Players and Their Positions The defiant Councilmen: Peter Chema, Edward J. Fagan Jr., Nicholas V. Longo, Henry Spallone: Mr. Spallone says he will not accept any new public housing in Yonkers. His three colleagues say the court-ordered housing plan must be changed to reduce its impact on the city's neighborhoods. Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko: The City Council must approve the housing plan. Governor Cuomo: The law must be obeyed and he will act to remove the four Councilmen from office if they run out of appeals but continue their opposition. Judge Leonard B. Sand: The city must approve the housing ordinance that the City Council agreed to in a consent decree or suffer bankrupting fines. Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, chairman of the Emergency Financial Control Board : The City Council must stop incurring the contempt fines or be prosecuted for unauthorized spending. The Price Fines levied against the City of Yonkers, which started accumulating Aug. 2, were suspended from Aug. 9 to Sept. 2 while contempt ruling was appealed. $ Day's fine Cumulative total Day 1 $ 100 $ 100 Day 2 200 300 Day 3 400 700 Day 4 800 1,500 Day 5 1,600 3,100 Day 6 3,200 6,300 Day 7 (today) 6,400 12,700 Day 8 12,800 25,500 Day 9 25,600 51,100 Day 10 51,200 102,300 Day 11 102,400 204,700 Day 12 204,800 409,500 Day 13 409,600 819,100 Day 14 819,200 1,638,300 All days thereafter 1,000,000 When the city would run out of cash: About Nov. 13 Total fines paid by that day: $66,638,300 Budget for 1988-89 fiscal year: $337,000,000",1988-09-03T05:00:00+0000

Primerica, the former American Can Company, has been transformed into a financial services conglomerate by Gerald Tsai Jr., who made a fortune during the stock market's ''go-go'' years of the 1960's. Mr. Weill began building his Wall Street firm in the 1960's and in 1981 sold Shearson to American Express for $1 billion. In 1986 he bought into Commercial Credit, which provides consumer loans. The new company will be known as Primerica, and Mr. Weill will hold the top offices.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"L.A. IS THE CAPITAL OF KANSAS: Painful Lessons in Post-New York Living. By Richard Meltzer. (Harmony, $16.95.) A native New Yorker who moved to Los Angeles in 1975 at the age of 30, the rock critic Richard Meltzer enterprisingly turned his dissatisfactions with his new home into a series of humorous pieces chronicling his anomalous life as a ''writer in a town where nobody reads.'' This book collects those essays and, in the interest of coherence, unites them by advancing the (not particularly original) thesis that Los Angeles is the purest expression of American culture - thus making the author's loony rants a type of social critique. Taken individually, many of the articles are entertaining enough, and some are simply hilarious. The section titled ''The Everyman Blues,'' which tells of the author's loneliness in Tinseltown and his struggle to make a living as a writer, moves beyond laughs and fashions a powerful blend of edginess and poignancy. Mr. Meltzer's prose style, however, finally emerges as the book's main delight as well as its most serious problem. Racketing and energetic at its best, his writing combines a slouching adolescent casualness with grudging high culture allusions and a use of odd contractions, abbreviations, italics and capitals to dramatize his impatience with ''the cagelike prison geometry of the printed page.'' But over the course of the more than 30 pieces, his ceaseless quest for originality of expression proves just as desperate, confining and dull a prison. L.A. as the capital of Kansas is a clever conceit. But it's not too tough to figure out in which locale twaddle like ''the given sports qua form/fulfillment mind-manifestingly merit, leaving this town an easy 20-30 years behind even . . . Detroit in terms of, y'know, eschatological sportish etc.'' originated.",1988-09-04T05:00:00+0000

The pipes leading to my bathroom fixtures were not replaced because my problem was not too bad then and the co-op reserve fund was limited. At the time, the co-op paid for all interior repair work except for repainting the walls that had been opened. Now I have minimal water flow in my bathroom and the building has a substantial reserve fund. Am I correct in believing that the co-op must replace the pipes and pay to replace the wall and tile, even if my bathroom will need more extensive work than the other apartments did? . . . . J. Z., Manhattan Answer: Not necessarily. According to Marc Luxemburg, an attorney who is president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the typical proprietary lease provides that the co-op is responsible for maintaining common facilities including pipes within walls.

For another, they are rarely seen noshing anything mundane. Peanut butter sandwiches are O.K. for Jones Beach, where sand gets in them anyway, but not for places like Central Park. There, sesame chicken is eaten with chopsticks, champagne is sipped from long-stemmed flutes and candelabra illuminate an alfresco repast.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ALMOST LIKE BEING HERE. By Tom Leopold. (Dutton, $15.95.) It's not a good week for Sandy Bayard, the narrator of Tom Leopold's occasionally diverting first novel. His shrink is getting senile, there's no hot water in his Manhattan apartment and his ex-girlfriend has just killed herself, apparently because of something he did. The play he was in has folded, and now a succession of women keep distracting him while he's trying to have an existential crisis. Sandy's solution is to get drunk and stoned immediately - yet still keep his grip on the old sense of humor. Using this basic scenario, Mr. Leopold has produced a work reminiscent of Jay McInerney's popular novel ''Bright Lights, Big City,'' which portrayed hip, urban youth adrift in the mid-1980's. Mr. Leopold can write entertainingly, and he keeps his narrative moving at a good pace toward an unexpected conclusion as Sandy gravitates between New York and Boston, moving from woman to woman, seeking to acquit himself of blame for his former girlfriend's death. Nonetheless, the reader is tempted to tell Mr. Leopold to relax and not try so hard to be funny or insightful. Another problem is the patronizing tone the book occasionally takes toward women: Sandy, for example, apparently doesn't have his tongue in his cheek when he refers to his current flame as ''a good girl.'' Mr. Leopold, who has written material for a number of well-known comedians, has got thumbs-up dust-jacket quotes from Chevy Chase, Steve Allen and Paul Shaffer. Readers whose tastes are in sync with this crowd may well agree.",1988-09-04T05:00:00+0000

A Time magazine correspondent at the Vatican for more than 25 years, Wilton Wynn has written a gentle apologia for the recent pontiffs, in whom he sees a common journey of faith. Unfortunately, he offers little analysis of the shifting attitudes among many Roman Catholics that create distance between them and church authorities. Still, the range of anecdotes - from Pope John XXIII's private diplomacy with the Soviets to the rehearsing of ostensibly spontaneous moments on Pope John Paul II's trips - gives these profiles a fine human texture. One wishes ''old'' were used fewer times in reference to John XXIII, but the image of a clever man bypassing the Roman Curia and opening the church to modern winds is vivid. Pope Paul VI emerges as a more compelling, if elusive, figure: a liberal intellect, obsessed with bureaucracy, whose support of liberation theology was greatly overshadowed by Humanae Vitae, his encyclical banning artificial contraception. The section on Paul's Hamlet-like agonizing over the encyclical is rather weak, and Mr. Wynn gives scant coverage to Pope John Paul I, whose brief papacy showed clear signs of reversing the ban. The author quotes eloquent writings by John Paul II about conjugal intimacy, yet fails to consider arguments of dissident theologians against the 1987 papal instruction forbidding artificial insemination. But the church is vast, and the wealth of information and character insights, especially about Curia figures, makes this an irresistible book.",1988-09-04T05:00:00+0000

His design for the Issey Miyake shop on London's Sloane Street includes only one rack to display clothes. ''It is a far more luxurious attitude than the normal method of retailing,'' Chipperfield says. And one that is thought to boost sales.

The main character in ''One Size Doesn't Fit All'' -the third book written by John Madden with the New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson - is the Maddencruiser, a deluxe, oversize bus designed for the television broadcaster and former football coach by Greyhound as a publicity gimmick. (He has refused to fly since retiring as coach of the Oakland Raiders.) Long rides on the Maddencruiser allow plenty of time for reflection, and Mr. Madden guides us on a lighthearted cross-country tour as he muses on ''pets and golf and broadcasting and having kids.'' He comes across much as he does on television, as an emphatic, unpretentious, slightly goofy sports enthusiast who also loves to eat. Mr. Madden's homespun charm can be delightful. The maxims he lives by, he tells us, include ''Never go to a restaurant where you need a reservation'' and ''Never go to a golf course where you need a tee time.'' But there are times when he lets his whimsy ramble too far. He devotes a whole chapter, for instance, to football players' uniform numbers and the hypothetical numbers he would assign dozens of celebrities. To this fan's taste, Mr. Madden is at his best when he sticks to football. It is in his discussions of why Super Bowl champions are unable to win in successive years, why Astroturf is a player's worst enemy or how to avoid athletic scandals at academic institutions that we see not John Madden the celebrity, but John Madden the shrewd sports analyst.",1988-09-04T05:00:00+0000

Merrett Stierheim, executive director of the Women's International Tennis Association, called it a long overdue restructuring of the computer point system. Either way, the result will be the same: Steffi Graf, the No. 1 player in the world, will be unable to dominate the women's tour in the future the way she has the past two years. This has incensed her father, who said that Steffi may not meet her commitment of playing in 11 Virginia Slims series events in 1989, exclusive of the four Grand Slam tournaments. If that occurs, then Graf will be ineligible for the bonus pool awarded at the Virginia Slims championships in November, although she can enter any of the tournaments on the calendar. If she plays only sparingly, it could also endanger her No. 1 ranking. The ranking system is cumulative, each year carrying over from the previous one. Points are distributed on the basis of the importance of a tournament. In the past, a top player who participated in a lesser tournament to help that tournament's gate and the W.I.T.A. meet its contractual obligations was not penalized. Her overall point average was adjusted so that the event would carry the weight of a bigger tournament. On Sunday, however, in a W.I.T.A. meeting attended by 111 players, the membership voted to abolish the ''play down'' or adjustment rule. Thus, Graf, who has won 18 tournaments during the past two years, will be penalized the most, her average dropping no matter what she does next year.",1988-09-07T05:00:00+0000

Would the room be cooler if it had an insulated wood roof, with regular shingles that matched the rest of the house? A. It probably would. However, you may also get a good deal of relief by installing vents or louvers in the existing roof - the kind that will let the hot air escape but will not allow rain to come in. These are sold in home centers. Q. The wood on the front of my nine-year-old condominium has been stained several times and each time the stain peels in three or four months. Also, some of the wood has rotted. What causes this and what can be done to correct it, short of removing the wood and starting over? A. A true stain cannot peel; only paint peels, so you apparently have not been using a stain. Some companies make heavy-bodied finishes they call ''opaque stain'' or ''solid color stain,'' but these are really paints made to look like stain. Take all of it off by sanding or by using a remover, then apply a semi-opaque or transparent single stain.",1988-09-08T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"MARKETS Drexel Burnham Lambert was charged with a two-year scheme of illegal insider trading, defrauding clients, stock manipulation and other securities violations. Some of the long-awaited charges by the S.E.C. were more severe than had been anticipated. Four Drexel employees were named, including Michael Milken, the head of its junk-bond department, whose lucrative deals have been responsible for the firm's enormous growth within the last decade. The complaint also accused the Miami industrialist Victor Posner and his son Steven of violating Federal securities laws. [ Page A1. ] In all but two of the 18 instances in which the S.E.C. found fault with Drexel, Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted arbitrager, served as a ''front'' for Drexel, the S.E.C. said. [ D6. ] The U.S. sold $2.93 billion in dollars at the end of June and in July to try to slow the dollar's summer rally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. That was the most concerted attack on the dollar since the second half of 1985. [ D1. ] Investors can tie C.D. deposits to the Presidential election, earning bonuses if their candidate wins. Several savings institutions are offering what they call ''Presidential C.D.'s.'' [ D1. ] Yields rose on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds for the week ended yesterday. [ D17. ] French Government bonds will be traded as A.D.R.'s, starting later this month, on the New York Stock Exchange. [ D1. ] Stock prices edged higher as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.53 points, to close at 2,065.79. It was the third consecutive gain for the Dow. [ D10. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds ended slightly lower, as market participants cast an apprehensive eye on the dollar. [ D16. ] Coffee futures prices rose sharply for the second day on fears that a dry spell in Brazil could lengthen into a drought. [ D18. ] Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr. pleaded guilty to charges that he engaged in an illegal insider trading scheme. [ D6. ] THE ECONOMY A bill to limit the growth of imports of textiles, clothing and shoes cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, virtually assuring its passage later this week. That would set the stage for another trade confrontation with the Reagan Administration. The Senate voted, 68 to 29, to restrict debate on the measure, which would allow imports of textiles and clothing to increase 1 percent a year, compared with the 16 to 17 percent annual increases of most of this decade. [ A1. ] COMPANIES G.M. reached agreements with the nation's major steelmakers on purchasing contracts. G.M., the nation's largest steel buyer, would not disclose the terms of the agreements, but steel industry officials said the increases averaged about 3 percent. [ D1. ] Gold Circle discount stores will soon cease to exist. Campeau said it had sold its 76 Gold Circle stores to Kimco Development, which in turn will sell most of them to Target and Hills. [ D1. ] R. J. Reynolds sent an extensive scientific assessment of its new ''smokeless'' cigarette to members of Congress. [ D5. ] Ireland's High Court delayed a ruling for at least a month on whether the handshake agreement between Irish Distillers' largest stockholder and one of its suitors is binding. [ D2. ] Goodyear paid $1 million in bribes to Iraqi officials several years ago, a company spokesman said. [ D5. ] Carl C. Icahn won overwhelming investor support to convert T.W.A. into a private company. [ D5. ] Southmark was found liable for more than $130 million in a suit brought by a San Diego businessman whose company Southmark bought.

Dent and Calvin Thomas, a running back who violated the N.F.L.'s substance-abuse policy for the second time, were suspended by the league Wednesday. Thomas has already begun treatment. But in an interview with WLS-TV in Chicago, Dent said he was not a drug user. Zucker asked for an emergency hearing in Cook County Circuit Court on the matter today, seeking to clear the way for Dent to play with the Bears in Indianapolis Sunday. ''They didn't have reasonable cause,'' Zucker said, referring to the N.F.L.'s request for Dent to take the mandatory drug test. ''We are for a good drug policy, a strong drug policy, but it must be based on strong cause.'' The N.F.L. reserves the right to ask for a urine sample any time a player has tested positive in the last two years. If a player declines, the league treats it as a second drug offense and suspends him. ''I haven't seen anything that says he has tested positive in the past,'' Zucker said. The Players Association also backed Dent's position, saying that Commissioner Pete Rozelle had ''gone beyond the parameters set by the 1982 collectively bargained drug program.''(AP)",1988-09-09T05:00:00+0000

Political killings and imprisonment have not abated. 2 Fears of epidemic in Bangladesh are rising as flood waters recede. Illness and death from gastrointestinal disease have begun to increase; supplies of medicine and water purification tablets are scarce. 4 Members of Burma's air force defected to the opposition, hours after a former leader declared a provisional Goverment. Diplomats said the move could signal a weakening of military support for the Goverment. 3 The political upheval in Burma is a genuine democratic revolution, according to experts on Burma, who wonder why it took the Burmese so long to rise up against the authoritarian Government. 3 Washington stood behind its charge that Iraq had used poison gas against the Kurds. The Iraqis continued to deny the charge. The Senate approved a bill that would ban American commodity credits to Iraq. 4 Turkish examinations of Kurds have turned up no evidence to support claims that Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurds, Turkey said in a statement that did not directly contradict Washington. 4 Life at a Canadian weather station in Eureka, Northwest Territories, is severe, but the crew is bothered more by the way American television reports the weather than by polar bears or the cold. 4 Times are trying for Soviet readers, who now face limits on subscriptions to some of the most popular and provocative magazines and newspapers.

King, who started the day at one-under par, shot a two-under 70 for a two-day total of 141 over the 6,285-yard course at Riverside Golf and Country Club. Stephanie Farwig, Sandra Haynie and Penny Hammel were tied for second. King emerged as the leader late in the afternoon as Hammel took a double-bogey and Farwig took a bogey on the 18th hole. King said she did not feel like she had played particularly well and was happy to have the lead after two rounds of the 54-hole tournament. The first-day co-leader, Colleen Walker, missed an 18-inch putt for birdie on the first hole and went on to take bogeys on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and ninth holes. She shot even par on the back nine to fall to one over for the tournament, four shots off the pace. The other first-day leader, Susan Sanders, was four-over for the day and alone at even par 144 for the tournament. Hammell, who started the day at two under, took the lead briefly on the back nine when she birdied 11, took a par on 12, and sank three consecutive long putts, including a 40-footer on 15, to move to five under headed to the 16th tee. But Hammell, looking for her second title in her fourth year on the tour, bogeyed 16 and took the double-bogey on 18 to slip back to two under. Farwig, looking for her first victory, said her chipping and putting kept her in the tournament. With all her miscues, she said she was surprised to find herself near the top at the 14th hole.(AP) Player Wins by Two: Gary Player, tied for the lead with Dave Hill going into the par-five 17th hole yesterday, knew he would have make something happen if he was going to win the inaugural GTE North Senior Classic in Indianapolis. Player's second shot, which he estimated went almost 230 yards, rolled to within two feet of the hole. When he tapped in for an eagle 3, Player held a two-stroke lead going into the final hole, which he held for the victory in the $350,000 tournament with a 54-hole total of 201, 15 strokes under par. Hill, with a seven-under-par 65 for the final round, finished two strokes back at 203. Player's victory was his fifth on the senior circuit this season. (AP) Course Record for Green: Ken Green shot a course-record 11-under-par 61 to take a two-stroke lead after three rounds of the $700,000 Greater Milwaukee Open tournament in Franklin, Wis. It was the best 18-hole score in a PGA Tour event since David Edwards shot a 61 in last year's Bob Hope Classic. Green, winner of the Canadian Open in a playoff last Monday, birdied eight holes and eagled two to break the previous record of 62 at the 7,030-yard Tuckaway Country Club course. Green's total was 16-under 200 going into today's final round for the $126,000 first prize. Dave Barr, co-leader with Jim Gallagher Jr. at 10-under starting yesterday's round, was at 14-under 202 after shooting a 68. Next at 205 were Donnie Hammond, who had a 68, and Billy Andrade, who shot a 67.(AP) Dog Show Great Pyrenees Is Best: A Great Pyrenees, Ch. Rivergroves Run for the Roses, owned by Jean Boyd and Judith Cooper, was judged best in a field of 2,378 at the 54th Somerset Hills Kennel Club show yesterday on the County Fair Grounds at North Branch, N.J.

When a Hollywood agent saw him in a professional production of ''The Beggar's Opera'' and urged him to audition for a movie, the 20-year-old college student promptly got the part. Before long, he had appeared in a number of television and movie roles (among them as Robin Williams's amiable escort and buddy in last year's ''Good Morning, Vietnam''). This year, his first leading performance, as the legendary jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker in the movie ''Bird,'' won him, at the age of 26, the best actor's award at the Cannes Film Festival.

For most economists the period from 1974 to the present is filled with inconsistencies, which Joyce Kolko does her best to explain from an orthodox Marxist perspective. Much of the world during the mid-1970's and the first half of the 1980's was in a profound state of economic, financial and even agricultural crisis, as Ms. Kolko terms it, and the third world especially was hard hit by famine and debt. This period, which came on the heels of nearly 30 years of steady global economic growth, was full of some of the strangest bedfellows any economist could imagine. Inflation, which usually accompanies overheated growth, found itself coupled with slow growth and even economic decline - the infamous ''stagflation'' of the Ford and Carter years; some third world countries saw prices for their raw materials skyrocket while they ran up astronomical levels of debt. Many such problems are with us still, but the analysis presented by Ms. Kolko (the author of ''America and the Crisis of World Capitalism'') sheds no new light on the problems or the solutions. Her book, which reads like the United Nations reports from which much of the research was derived, often simply describes the rapid changes that are under way internationally. It rehashes the failings of the world economic system but offers few practical insights into ways to correct them. Yet despite its shortcomings, this book should still be of interest simply because its Marxist point of view is so fundamentally opposed to that of Reaganomics - but so in line with the prevailing thought in much of the third world.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

At this year's fair, which opens Wednesday and runs through Sept. 19, the usual bravado will be in evidence. But bravado of a more subtle nature. According to experts, designs will be a bit more subdued than in past seasons. ''The era of wild, grabby pie-in-the-sky furniture is over,'' says Sam Friedman, president of I.C.F.

About $5 billion of American's bad loans and $13 billion in mortgage-backed securities will be placed in a separate bank for liquidation.

us,ONOFICTION,"SOUL OF THE TIGER: Searching for Nature's Answers in Exotic Southeast Asia. By Jeffrey A. McNeely and Paul Spencer Wachtel. (Doubleday, $19.95.) The rural people of Southeast Asia believe that a close spiritual tie binds wildlife with humans. Though recognizing the many differences between humans and animals, they think they have similar and transferable souls. Most Balinese families, for example, have animal totems, which usually commemorate a deer, bear or other animal that figures in their history and might harbor the soul of a departed ancestor. Tigers, in particular, are assumed to possess the souls of those they devoured. The members of a hill tribe in Vietnam thought a tiger that killed and ate only women was inhabited by the soul of a deceived husband; as a result, marital fidelity swept through their village. In one fascinating account after another in ''Soul of the Tiger,'' Jeffrey A. McNeely, an anthropologist and zoologist, and Paul Spencer Wachtel, a journalist and psychologist, explain the folklore in which animals are an everyday part of community life as mythological symbols or ancestors incarnate, as well as being sources of meat, leather and medicine. The tales are told with humor, but without condescension. The authors, who went to Southeast Asia in the l960's as Peace Corps volunteers and remained until recently as conservationists, look with favor on the harmony of human-wildlife relations they encountered and conclude that these traditional approaches to conservation should be encouraged in a third world that seeks to balance economic growth and environmental preservation. As Mr. McNeely and Mr. Wachtel note, ''The belief in universal souls means that we are all veritable soul brothers.''",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

Her eye is kindly, wise and versatile (an eye that you would want on your jury if you ever had to stand trial), and after going at each new set of characters with authorial eagerness and an exuberant tumble of details, she tends to arrive at a set of conclusions about them that is a sort of golden mean.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,SEASON PREVIEW: PHOTOGRAPHY,"The sesquicentennial of photography's birth approaches, a number of individual and group shows will demonstrate that the medium's future is as bright as its past, and every bit as diverse. This is especially true in September, when the season kicks off with images ranging from the picturesque (''Odyssey,'' a survey of 100 years of National Geographic photography) to the socially concerned (''Homeless in America'' and Nicholas Nixon's portraits). Beginning in January, at least a half-dozen major exhibitions are planned to mark the 150 years since Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre announced to the French Academy his method for fixing light and shadow. New Yorkers will have to hold their applause until 1990, however, since that is when the Museum of Modern Art's 150-year survey, entitled ''The History of Photography,'' will appear. A SELECTIVE GUIDE September Arnold Newman: New Collages, New Photographs and Unseen Vintage Prints. Known for his ''environmental portraits'' of artists, Newman also has an experimental side, featured in this show. Sept. 15-Oct. 8, Sidney Janis Gallery, 110 West 57th Street, 586-0110. The exhibition is a companion to his retrospective at the New-York Historical Society. Homeless in America. Five of the most respected photojournalists working today - Mary Ellen Mark, Bill Pierce, Eli Reed, Eugene Richards and Stephen Shames -assay the visual manifestations of homelessness, in a project sponsored by Families for the Homeless and the National Mental Health Association. Sept. 16-Oct. 22, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, 869-8089. Nicholas Nixon: Pictures of People. This 120-print, 10-year retrospective will chart the photographer's passage from formally complex pictures of children and family groups to close-to-the-bone portraits of nursing-home residents and people with AIDS. The constant of his career has been the 8-by-10-inch contact print. Sept. 15-Nov. 13, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, 708-9480. A companion exhibition, focusing on Nixon's most recent work, will be held Sept. 16-Oct. 22 at the Zabriskie Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, 307-7430. Odyssey: The Art of Photography at National Geographic. Part of the National Geographic Society's 1988 centennial celebration, this mammoth survey (more than 250 prints) includes pictures familiar to readers of its magazine as well as images culled from its substantial archive. Sept. 16-Oct. 30, International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, 860-1777. The Starn Twins. The precocious and ubiquitous brothers receive the imprimatur of Leo Castelli. Sept. 24-Oct. 15, Leo Castelli, 420 West Broadway, 431-5160. October New Photography 4. Once more the Museum of Modern Art sallies forth into the breach of contemporary image making. This year's nominees are Patrick Faigenbaum, Reagan Louie and Michael Schmidt; the pictures were taken in China, Italy and Germany. Oct. 20-Jan. 10, Museum of Modern Art, 708-9480. November Master Photographs from Photography in the Fine Arts, 1959-67. This exhibition reflects upon one of the postwar era's more quixotic artistic efforts, the Photography in the Fine Arts Project. Organized by the photographer Ivan Dmitri, the PFA Project mounted a series of group shows intended to prove, once and for all, that photography was indeed an art. Assembled here are images from the most illustrious of the exhibits, by Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson and others. Nov. 8-Jan. 8, International Center of Photography, 860-1777. December Perpetual Motif: The Art of Man Ray. Bringing together the artist's photographs, works on paper and objects, this exhibition promises to be the most penetrating look yet into a career that has been simultaneously influential and perplexing. Dec. 2-Feb. 20, National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C., 202 357-2700. Robert Mapplethorpe. The second United States exhibition this year devoted to the photographer's career features 170 works and a traveling schedule that will take it to Chicago, Boston and Washington. Dec. 9-Jan. 29, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, 215 898-7108. January Experimental Photography: Discovery and Invention.

Walker Evans: American Photographs. It has been 50 years since Evans's classic volume, ''American Photographs,'' was first published, which is occasion enough for presenting the original prints once again.

February The Art of Photography: 150 Years, 1839-1989.

us,NONFICTION,"TO THE MEMORY OF CHILDHOOD. By Lydia Chukovskaya. Translated by Eliza Kellogg Klose. (Northwestern University, Cloth, $24.95; Paper, $9.95.) This memoir by the novelist and dissident Lydia Chukovskaya is a charming and powerful tribute to her father, Kornei Chukovsky, the Russian critic, translator and author. A reminiscence of the years 1910 to 1917, when she was a child and the family lived in Kuokkala on the Gulf of Finland, the book describes a man who was a self-made intellectual, passionate about language and fanatical about poetry. The sense of humor and fun that later made Kornei Chukovsky an extremely popular writer of children's verse (many of his fairy tales are still available in this country) is apparent here. My favorite example is the story about a guard dog that escapes and starts after the terrified children. ''Do exactly as I do!'' Chukovsky shouts, and then drops on all fours to the dust. ''We follow suit right next to him,'' the author says, and the dog immediately backs off, surprised at the sight and sound of the whole family on hands and knees, barking. While Lydia Chukovskaya writes primarily of his role as a father, it is clear that Chukovsky's business was literature. He ate, drank, breathed and - when he could - slept literature. (He was an insomniac who could fall asleep only as young Lydia read to him.) Fortunately for the readers of ''To the Memory of Childhood,'' published here in a graceful translation, Kornei Chukovsky also was a gifted teacher who passed on the love of language to his daughter.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

Her art has served her as a way to reconstruct and preserve the spiritual fabric of her life, which began in a provincial Galician town in 1908. While A MIRROR TO MY LIFE (Holt, $29.95) reproduces in color more than 90 of the paintings Mrs. Hessing has made in the last 30 years, it is as much a memoir and affirmation of her essential humanism as it is an art book. After a brief autobiographical introduction, Mrs. Hessing comments on the paintings, describing the stories they tell, their iconography and how she came to make them. Many paintings re-create well-known stories from the Bible and Jewish folklore; others recall her childhood in Zaleszczyki, where she lived until she was 6. A few pictures relate to the places she has lived since the end of World War II, particularly Israel (briefly) and Australia. Mrs. Hessing's ingenuous style is strikingly reminiscent of Chagall in some particulars. The paintings reveal an exuberant colorist and an intuitively efficient organizer of pictorial space, especially when she chooses to tell a story like that of Abraham and Hagar sequentially on a single panel. The real text of this charming book is subliminal, however; it is a morality tale that preaches faith and optimism in the face of adversity and a resounding belief in the essential goodness of one's fellow man. In transmuting her life into art, Mrs. Hessing has obviously edited out the distressing episodes (only two pictures depict the Holocaust), choosing instead to idealize beauty, the verities of religious and cultural tradition and the wonder of childhood.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

An Olympic sport for men since 1908, field hockey became one for women in 1980, when the United States boycotted the Games. Surprising many, the American women won the bronze medal in 1984 in Los Angeles; they are seeded fifth in the eight-team Seoul tournament. (The United States did not qualify for the 12-team men's tournament.) The sport is like soccer in strategy - 11 players on a soccer-sized field trying to propel a ball into a goal - and a bit like ice hockey in implements. The stick has a short, blunt head curved on one side, and only the flat side may be used to strike the ball, which is about the size of a baseball and rock-hard. Artificial turf fields, now used in all major tournaments, have made the sport even faster, putting premium on rapid-fire passing, not to mention aerobic conditioning.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

Alice Bettonville, the narrator of this first novel by Sally Savic, is an Ohioan working for a New Orleans newspaper and living in a house she has inherited from her step-grandmother, a family outsider with whom Alice identifies. It seems that the naive Alice has fallen in with some unsavory characters. One of her co-workers is a malicious conniver. Her neighbor's son, Boy, who makes menacing advances to her, stores stolen property in her attic. And she is married to the irresistible but unfaithful Marshall Bettonville, who has abruptly disappeared. Marshall's shrewish mother believes he is dead. The hideously obese Penny Lapere, Alice's neighbor and friend, thinks he has abandoned his wife. Penny's son, the delinquent Boy, tells Alice her husband is on the lam from his creditors. ''Elysian Fields'' is the story of Alice's search for the truth - about Marshall and herself. Part mystery, part psychological study of despair, part caricature, the novel mingles rich, sensuous imagery with descriptions of grotesque characters and seedy places. Taking her title from the legendary New Orleans street named for the Greek paradise, Ms. Savic displays a good ear for dialogue and an eye for authentic local detail. Indeed, in her description of a wide range of New Orleans eccentrics, she echoes John Kennedy Toole's ''Confederacy of Dunces.'' However, where Toole's novel was consistently satiric, Ms. Savic's fluctuates between the farcical and the serious, and her characters are overdrawn. But although the plot in ''Elysian Fields'' is too thin to support such a heavy cast of grotesques, the novel bodes well for Sally Savic's future. She is a promising writer with a rich, atmospheric style.",1988-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"WILLIAM EVERSON: The Life of Brother Antoninus. By Lee Bartlett. (New Directions, $25.95.) The poet William Everson has had a dramatic life. As a teen-ager in 1930 he started a sexual affair with a girl in his California hometown that lasted eight years before they were married. But then, fearing his Oedipus complex would make him a bad parent, he had a vasectomy. While he spent World War II in a conscientious objectors' camp his wife became the lover of one of his friends. He married again after the war but separated in a year. Then, having been always an agnostic, he was baptized as a Roman Catholic in 1949 at the age of 36 and shortly afterward became director of the new Catholic Worker house in Oakland, Calif. In 1951 he entered the Dominican order as a lay brother, and it was as Brother Antoninus that he gained national attention as a poet - a most conspicuous San Francisco Beat poet. His asceticism was so fierce that even priests protested, but he conceived intense passions for several women, one of them celebrated in the mystical and erotic sequence ''The Rose of Solitude.'' In 1969 he left the Dominicans, married a woman 35 years his junior and became a college teacher. Parkinson's disease ended his career several years ago. Some of his poetry may endure, but it is his printing that should be revered for ages.

Saadat Hasan Manto never lived to see his work translated; given the quality of this English edition, he was probably lucky. Born a Moslem in the Punjab region of India, Manto was forced by the violence that accompanied partition to leave for Pakistan, where he died in 1955 at the age of 43. His fiction, written in Urdu, has since maintained a large following throughout the subcontinent. Most of the stories in this collection protest communal and sectarian hatred. (In ''The Dog of Titwal,'' for example, a stray mutt wanders between warring Pakistani and Indian troops. When each side discovers that the other has been caring for the animal, the dog, like the civilian population, comes under fire from both armies.) In making Manto's work available to English readers for the first time, Khalid Hasan has rendered it into wooden, obscure prose that is studded with anachronisms. But even after this is taken into account, Western readers accustomed to sharply focused plots and economy of literary effect are likely to find Manto's stories amateurish and predictable.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

Together with Frank Harris, who edited The Evening News, Stead altered the character of daily journalism in Britain during the mid-1880's. Papers became simpler - as he wished the world to be. He popularized interviews, added illustrations, invented picturesque headlines, pursued virtuous crusades. ''All his indignations did him credit,'' Shaw affirmed; but his ''infatuation with his own emotions'' made him deeply untrustworthy. His emotions were sacred to him. When he was angry it was obvious to him that everyone shared his anger; when he wept, he took it for granted that the world wept with him. People read his paper to find out what on earth he was up to next. One day he would drop in on General Gordon at Southampton and call for him to be sent to Khartoum; next he was warning Gladstone against declaring war on Russia; then, switching his energies elsewhere, he fell strongly behind Mrs. Gordon-Baillie's scheme for establishing fishing settlements in Tasmania for Scottish crofters; and, most extraordinary of all, as part of his campaign against London vice, he had procured five virgins for seduction and landed himself in prison.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

His hero, Stephen - idiosyncratic, vaguely misanthropic, bisexual - becomes obsessed with Gilberte, a manipulative and ambitious young photographer. But when Stephen secures a position for Gilberte at the SoHo bookstore where he works as manager, she proceeds to have a professionally expedient affair with the shop owner's wife. In compulsive detail, Stephen recounts Gilberte's rise to ingenue art star, deconstructing her every strategy and motive and examining his own role as artistic conscience, lover and collaborator. Through this sardonic and cerebral confession, Mr. Dess considers art and authenticity, love and exploitation, appearance and reality. Ultimately, Stephen comes to believe that both love and art in their purest forms should involve honesty, sacrifice and the gut-wrench of recognition that makes visceral communication possible. If, like his narrator, Mr. Dess harbors such impeccable esthetic ideals, then he has written a novel worthy of his own standards. Like the Picabia painting on its cover, ''His Vision of Her'' is a palimpsest: expressive but tantalizingly elusive. Its characters emerge and retreat, their images distorted by the narrator's edited perspective or their own self-presentations. It is a tribute to Mr. Dess's technical precision and to his compassion that, even through the medium of Stephen's rarified vision of Gilberte, we get an indelible and poignant vision of them both.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

The lure of the five- or six-course lunch, followed after a decent interval by a 10-course banquet in the evening, calls for a breakfast strategy. You might be tempted to have that meal in your hotel.

Then there are many millions who are simply underinsured.

When the story flags, he whips out a last-minute disease to provide a perfunctory climax. And the prose? Some is elaborate. (''While his fellow classmates thought they were in hell, he felt like a purified soul, who in a few brief days would leave this transient purgatory and soar up to be emparadised in Cheryl's arms.'') Some is cliched. (''We're in this together.'') ''Doctors'' is what happens when you fuse a professor of classics and comparative literature with a pop novelist: the idealistic academic prescribes doses of serious issues and major moral dilemmas, while the pragmatic pop novelist wants to get on with it and make this book a hit. The latter hatches characters so fast their faces blur and zips them through multiple adventures, pausing only occasionally to let the former drop in historical and medical nuggets. And the story? Will childhood friends Barney and Laura find love? What about the other members of Harvard Medical School's class of 1962? What will happen to Dr. Perfect, the brilliant black Rhodes scholar with the Holocaust survivor foster-parents? Fortunately, Erich Segal the pop novelist manages to grapple the more ambitious (and somewhat boring) Professor Segal into submission in time for a happy conclusion.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Review/Music; Mehta, Webern and Schoenberg",It is rough on the symphony orchestras of America that they should play best a repertory for which few of their subscribers want to pay. The presence of Webern's ''Six Pieces for Orchestra'' on the New York Philharmonic's first subscription concert of the season Friday evening no doubt played its part in keeping the hall appreciably less than full. And the warmest applause of the evening certainly went to Schubert's Ninth Symphony. But that should probably be interpreted as an endorsement of the score; Zubin Mehta and the orchestra got much closer to the gist of the Webern than of the Schubert. Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony in E came out somewhere in between.,1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,HIS OWN BIG PICTURE,"Stuart Davis (1892-1964) was an artist whose biography is that of American 20th-century art. It is not that Davis was at the center of the mainstream art world. Rather, as we learn in Karen Wilkin's book STUART DAVIS (Abbeville, $85), a lavishly illustrated and handsome coffeetable volume, he was an important and representative figure, one who started in the socially conscious Ashcan School tradition and became an outstanding Cubist. Davis was inspired by technology and city living, and he translated this into work that featured brilliant colors and intriguing spatial relationships. Ms. Wilkin, an art historian and critic, places him in the context of his times. Hers is more a biography of the artist than of the man and that is all to the good, although the Davis we see here is a fascinating personality. He was articulate, even scathing, in speech (and used words as elements in his paintings) and was as intensely political as he was eloquent in his condemnation of the harnessing of art to political ends, either by Stalin or Hitler or by American conformists. The pictures, in color and in black and white, are beautifully reproduced. Ms. Wilkin writes interestingly about the developments in American art in the 20th century, and she has provided a valuable summary of events, concepts and techniques that knits together a history too often fragmented by discursions that obscure the big picture. ''Stuart Davis'' puts it all together in a most attractive way.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,My Birth And the Great Hurricane of '38,"WITH a mighty and explosive burst, the wind split the giant elm, sending it crashing through the garage; the lights went out, the trolleys stopped and my whole birthday party was forced to sleep over. It was 1945, the night of my seventh birthday. It was a night of cozy excitement and as the wind whistled, my family sat around the candle-lit kitchen table. ''This is how it was the night you were born,'' one aunt told me. ''Only worse,'' piped in another. ''No one will ever forget the night of the Great Hurricane of '38!'' ''The hospital lights were all dim,'' my mother told me. ''But I wasn't at all surprised there was such a storm the night you were born!'' Much laughter. My brother poking me in the ribs. ''Hold it, hold it,'' I cried. ''What's so funny? Wasn't it scary?'' More laughs, my grandmother with the unmistakable gesture of Italian love, tweaking both my cheeks, my mother exchanging the female's knowing looks with her sisters. More rib pokes and tousling of hair. As the 50th anniversary of that great storm arrives along with my halfcentury birthday, I look back to this sequence of memory for the start of my curious and paradoxical bonding to the hurricane of 1938. For the stage was here set for a theme of my life and of the lives of many who have made this trip with me. The mythology of the hurricane was insinuated into my life much like an astrological sign. It was a source of personal identity, individual mystique, and it was a historic connection with the lives of others. From that birthday party, I learned of what a difficult pregnancy I was for my mother, how much I kicked and squirmed and how long was the delivery and recovery. ''Like a storm coming that finally arrived,'' she would say from time to time. To which there was always someone to say (often myself), ''And you've been checking out the damage ever since!'' And what was the damage of this coincidence that impressed itself on my young psyche? I seem always to have known that hundreds of people perished that tempestuous night so that, when the going got tough for the little kid, having survived the birth storm was a source of confidence and optimism. When I was a teen-ager, too freely expressing criticism of my parents, I could not be told, ''An apple falls not far from the tree,'' for I always had the ready response, ''It does in a hurricane!'' I believed it and I lived it. The cosmic connection I bear to hurricanes was reinforced at every turn. With uncanny consistency, a hurricane hit the East Coast of the United States every seven years as I celebrated my birthday for over a quarter-century. Rarely has there not been a stormy landfall for me to receive as nature's birthday gift. When ''camp'' was in, I searched for my personal camp hero. No doubt about it: Richard Widmark, for his otherwise unremarkable performance in ''Slattery's Hurricane.'' I have met dozens of people who witnessed the famous storm and volunteered their stories for my memory. It was natural, for every offhanded reminiscence of that night precipitated a mutual interest. No one who lived through the ''Great Storm'' forgot where he was or what he was doing at that moment. A typical conversation took place at Woods Hole, Mass., when, during a chance encounter with an elderly mason repairing an old stone wall, it was volunteered that he ''first built it 33 years ago, after the storm.'' That would be my invitation to say, ''That was the night I was born.'' His memory was immediately loosened as I learned how this man had spent the better part of that night in 1938 ''rope-tied to that there post,'' as he pointed to it, ''10 feet off the ground and two feet out of the water, fearing for my life up there.'' I have met people who spent the night in Long Island Rail Road cars with their feet wet, who had their front yards end up on their neighbors' backyards, whose boats moored in Southampton Sound traveled overnight to Peconic Bay where there had not previously been a waterway and some who woke up the next morning to find the sand bar of Long Island's South Fork had been moved hundreds of yards east and north. So fearful was the darkness that night that the town fathers of Southampton vowed ''never again'' and invested in their own gas-powered generator. Twenty-seven years later, in October 1965, when the rest of the Eastern United States was plunged into darkness in the ''Great Blackout,'' Southampton's lights merely flickered once. The folklore is endless, and even though I could not possibly have had any of the experience, much of it is collected in my memory. In some part of my identity, I have thought of myself as born as much of storm as of woman. As a professor to the generation of the 1960's when asked that obligatory student question, ''What sign were you born under?'' my unblinking answer was ''Hurricane.'' It was, of course, with great interest that I came upon a book-length account of my stormy day shortly before the crisis of my 40th birthday. I bought it on the spot! I could hardly wait to immerse myself in a subject so intimate to me but still so unstructured in a mosaic of anecdotes. I never got past the first page. The hurricane of 1938, which had played a role of continuity in most of my life, became a symbol, once again, but this time it was of the discontinuity of midlife reconsideration. I thought the author was mistaken when he dated the storm as Sept. 21, 1938. A misprint, I was sure: I was born on Sept. 14! Who at age 55-minus-10 has not felt the famous lack of sufficient substance of those first four decades? Who has not wished to celebrate the truths of his life if only to eclipse the lies, to fete the successes and regret not the untraveled paths? Who has not struggled, at that age, with the downside?",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

For instance, Charlie Rosner, creative director for a New York City advertising agency, favors very short nails for drawing, and delights in his periodic pilgrimages to Manhattan's Gio Hair Stylists because the manicurists there, he says, ''are kind enough to give me half an hour of complete silence once every 10 days to two weeks.'' Si E. Knee, a New Jersey leather-goods consultant who is a frequent manicure customer at Joseph Hair Stylists in Manhattan, has been getting his nails done - buff, no polish - for 30 years simply because ''it makes me feel good.''",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THEN AGAIN. By Sue McCauley. (Hodder & Stoughton/David & Charles, $22.95.) Even when outcasts find each other, that may be all they find: society has usually closed and locked the door. In her very good first novel, ''Other Halves,'' the New Zealand writer Sue McCauley vividly portrayed two of society's rejects struggling to build a life in a highly industrialized country that is secretly sick of itself. Here, condescension if not dislike is the normal approach to ''misfits'': the poor, the Maori minority, single mothers on welfare, homosexuals, the insane. In ''Then Again,'' her second novel, Ms. McCauley approaches the same theme from many directions but is not as successful. In alternating sections she develops the lives of a larger cast of characters who assemble on a bucolic island near Auckland, trying to escape the buttoned-up society that has rejected them. Maureen and her three anxious children are on welfare; Keith, who drinks too much, has quit his reporter's job after siding with a Maori in a labor dispute; beautiful, middle-aged, overweight Josie is afraid after several bad marriages to try again with Geoff, who loves her. Ms. McCauley uses a houseful of militant lesbian feminists to raise some women's issues, but she has a bigger aim in mind: the irony of ''safety'' in a nuclear-free zone. ''Sometimes,'' says one woman to Keith, it ''seems so futile. . . . Yet I can see if we were all . . . determined . . . well then we'd have disarmament tomorrow. So the reason for despair lies in what we are.'' As the characters meet, and as one of them, in despair, chooses violence, the author's preaching clouds the story. Yet her portraits, especially of the women, stand out above the fog.",1988-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,The Games at a Glance,"Diving Greg Louganis, who required four stitches in his scalp after hitting his head on the board yesterday during a dive in the preliminaries of the 3-meter springboard, got all the comfort he needed when the gold medal was wrapped around his neck today. It was the third gold medal of the American diver's career. Gymnastics The bars were uneven, the ruling unusual. The result was that the United States women's team, caught in a technical violation on the uneven parallel bars, cried foul. The Americans, in the middle of a surprisingly strong showing in the compulsory portion of the team competition Monday night, had half a point deducted when a committee ruled that Rhonda Faehn had remained on the raised stage surrounding the uneven bars as one of her teammates completed a routine. The ruling on the obscure violation, which was unsuccessfully appealed by American officials, dropped the team to fourth place behind East Germany. The Soviet Union was in first place, getting a perfect 10 in the vault from Elena Shushunova. Daniela Silivas of Rumania, which was second in team scoring, turned in the most spectacular individual performances, earning scores of 10 on the uneven bars and the floor exercise. Volleyball China, whose women's team is virtually unchanged from the one that captured the gold medal in 1984, again demonstrated skill virtually unapproached by anyone else. Today, China easily whipped the United States, 15-9, 15-5, 15-7, in a repeat of the match that decided the gold medal four years ago. Basketball The United States borrowed a page from Oscar Schmidt's handbook on how to shoot from long range this morning, hitting a trio of 3-point shots down the stretch to hold off Canada, 76-70. Having emulated Schmidt, the Brazilian scoring machine, the Americans now get to encounter him. The United States will face Brazil on tomorrow (tonight, 7:45 P.M., Eastern time). Schmidt led Brazil to a 130-108 victory over China. Swimming Tamas Darnyi of Hungary and Silke Horner of East Germany left Olympic records in their wakes today as they each set marks in qualifying heats. Darnyi, the men's world record-holder in the 400-meter individual medley, completed the event in 4:16.55. Horner smashed the women's Olympic record in the 200-meter breast-stroke with a time of 2:27.63. Matt Biondi of the United States qualified for the finals in the 100-meter butterfly in continuing his pursuit of seven medals. Boxing Unlike his teammate, Anthony Hembrick, Kenneth Gould arrived three hours before his fight. And unlike his teammate, Kelcie Banks, he was still standing three rounds after it began.

Pallone gained publicity this spring when he ejected Manager Pete Rose from a game in Cincinnati after the two bumped during an argument that sparked an angry crowd reaction, causing Pallone to leave the field. He was reportedly told by league officials that he could either leave now or be dismissed at the end of the season. Pallone last umpired a game on Thursday night in Philadelphia and is not scheduled to work again this season. ''He has asked for a leave of absence for personal reasons,'' said Kathy Feeney, a spokeswoman for the league. ''It was granted by Mr. Giamatti.'' Pallone, who lives in Manhattan, could not be reached for comment. Pallone was one of eight umpires who joined the National League in April 1979 during the umpires' seven-week strike. He never joined the umpires' union and, like the other seven replacements, was ostracized by regulars when he returned. (AP)",1988-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The Battle Over Disclosure: A Chronology,"FROM the beginning, labeling issues have been as important as health concerns in discussions concerning mechanically boned meat. 1976 - Earl Butz, Secretary of Agriculture in the Ford Administration, gave the meat industry permission to use mechanically boned meat in processed meats. The department was sued by several consumer groups arguing that consumers were not given an opportunity to comment on whether they wanted ground bone in food. Objections were made to the department's plan to exempt this mechanically separated meat from labeling requirements. The court agreed with consumers: the regulation was struck down. 1977 - Safety studies on mechanically separated meat were conducted by the Agriculture Department under the Carter Administration's appointee, Bob Bergland. Mechanically separated meat was allowed on the market, limited to 20 percent of the meat portion of processed meats. Labels were to indicate the presence and percentage of such products. The meat industry claimed such labels would deter sales. 1981 - The meat industry repeated its request for less restrictive labeling. John Block, Secretary of Agriculture, agreed to amend the regulations. References to bone would be deleted; the prominently placed phrase ''mechanically processed beef [ or pork ] product'' also would be deleted. Instead, mechanically separated meat was listed only in the ingredient list. Labels now indicated presence of ''calcium.'' 1982 - Consumer groups sued the Agriculture Department, contending that the reference to calcium made processed products seem nutritionally superior to regular meat products; the consumer groups lost. 1986 - Four sausage makers sued the Agriculture Department seeking regulations to label mechanically boned poultry the way mechanically boned meat was labeled. The department promised to consider more lenient regulations for the meat industry. The industry wanted elimination of the mechanically separated meat label requirement if no more than 10 percent of a product was such meat.",1988-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Games at a Glance,"GYMNASTICS The exercises may have been optional, but the rest of the competition had little choice but to watch in admiration as the Soviet Union won the gold medal in the men's team competition. The Soviet athletes, the dominant force in men's gymnastics, put on a stunning display of individual talent and collective strength, garnering at least one perfect score in five of the six events and three from Dmitri Bilozerchev as they easily outpointed East Germany, which took the silver. SWIMMING When Matt Biondi buried his head in the water to glide the final meter of the men's 100-meter butterfly final, he had the lead and every reason to believe the gold medal, as well. When he resurfaced, he had only regret. Anthony Nesty of Suriname used a final surge to edge Biondi and capture his country's first Olympic swimming medal ever. Nesty's time of 53.00 seconds was one-hundredth of a second faster than Biondi and shaved .08 off the Olympic record. Biondi, who won the bronze in the 200-meter freestyle, settled for the silver. He then returned hours later to earn his third medal of the games when he swam a brilliant anchor leg as the U.S.'s 800-meter freestyle relay team won the gold and set a world record of 7 minutes 12.51 seconds. CYCLING If it wasn't tough enough getting air into his lungs, Aleksandr Kiritchenko had the added problem of losing air out of his tire as he came down to the final 100 meters of the men's 1,000-meter time trial. The 21-year-old Soviet cyclist ultimately finished on a flat tire, but he completed the course in 1 minute 4.49 seconds to win. WEIGHT LIFTING Every time Naim Suleymanoglo got the bar over his head, another world record seemed to fall. Suleymanoglo, of Turkey, set three world marks on the way to the gold medal in the 132-pound class. Suleymanoglo, who defected from Bulgaria in 1986, lifted 336 pounds in the snatch, 419 in the clean and jerk and 755 over all. WATER POLO Revenge could not have come a moment too soon for the United States. As it happened, it came with only seconds left. The United States, whose bid for a gold medal was sunk by Yugoslavia four years ago, kept its current hopes afloat when James Bergeson scored with five seconds remaining as the Americans beat top-ranked Yugoslavia, 7-6, in the opening day of the tournament. BOXING Michael Carbajal cleared one of the major stumbing blocks to a gold medal when he won a 3-2 decision over Oh Kwang-soo of South Korea in the 106-pound class. Carbajal, a native of Phoenix, won the brawling fight by a single point on the cards of three judges in knocking off one of the favorites for the gold. WRESTLING When he left Italy, Vincenzo Maenza, promised his 6-year-old son Yuri he'd return from South Korea with a gold medal. Wednesday, he took the gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling when he defeated Andrzej Glab of Poland in the 105-pound division.",1988-09-21T05:00:00+0000

Workman played in both the 26-9 victory over Syracuse on Sept. 17 and the 42-10 loss to Pitt last Saturday. Workman said he accepted $1,000 from a San Francisco-based agent, David Lueddeke, to help his kid brothers. Workman testified Tuesday before a Federal grand jury in Chicago. ''There was no way to know anything about this because it was a grand-jury matter and was secret,'' Jones said. The grand jury is investigating the dealings of Lueddeke and the New York-based agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom. The three are accused of offering athletes cash, cars, clothing and trips for signed agreements allowing the agents to represent them in professional contract negotiations. The grand-jury investigation is part of an inquiry that last year cost the wide receiver Cris Carter his senior year of eligibility at Ohio State. Workman rushed for 1,030 yards in 1986 and led the Buckeyes in rushing last season with 470 yards on 118 carries. (AP)",1988-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"THE ECONOMY The Treasury began an investigation of the savings industry in an attempt to develop an accurate estimate of the cost of resolving the status of the nation's 500 insolvent savings institutions. Senator William Proxmire, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the next Congress would have to appropriate at least $20 billion to liquidate and merge these institutions. [ Page A1. ] The Consumer Price Index rose in August by 0.4 percent, the same as in July. Sizable increases for gasoline, cereals and other grain products, used cars and auto financing were partly offset by a huge drop for clothing and lesser declines for meats, fish and household fuels. The report reinforced the view that inflation is unlikely to climb to worrisome levels. [ D1. ] Prices in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area rose 0.5 percent. [ D6. ] Americans' personal incomes increased only half as fast as inflation in August. [ D6. ] Housing construction fell 3.3 percent last month; a decline in apartment construction outweighed a small gain in single-family homes. [ D6. ] Some lawmakers rejected the idea of cutting Social Security benefits. Robert S. Strauss, co-chairman of a bipartisan commission on deficit reduction, had said Tuesday that a proposed package of $68.5 billion in spending cuts would affect Social Security and other benefit programs. [ D1. ] COMPANIES A takeover battle between the largest gold-mining powers in the non-Communist world began when a unit of South Africa's Anglo American group made a $4.9 billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields, a London-based company with extensive gold-mining operations in South Africa. If successful, the takeover would bring about a restructuring of the gold-mining industry. [ D1. ] Polaroid filed a lawsuit that seeks to block a $2.4 billion hostile takeover bid from Shamrock Holdings. [ D5. ] McDonnell Douglas will lease a closed aircraft plant in Columbus, Ohio, to produce parts for its C-17 cargo jet. [ D5. ] Lassiter Properties will pay $17 million for 96,000 acres in New York's Adirondack Park. [ B1. ] Digital Equipment and MIPS Computer will share technology for reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. [ D2. ] KDI accepted a $19-a-share management-led buyout offer, valuing the diversified manufacturer at about $184 million. [ D5. ] MARKETS Massachusetts will ban mandatory arbitration agreements by brokerages, the first state to do so. The securities industry said it would sue, calling the plan ''clearly unconstitutional.'' [ D7. ] Stock prices were mixed, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 3.02, to close at 2,090.50. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers on the New York Stock Exchange, 697 to 689. [ D8. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds again advanced, despite a string of favorable economic reports. [ D16. ] Gold prices dropped below $400 an ounce for the first time in 19 months, as worries over inflation continued to ease. [ D6. ] Copper futures prices posted a sharp decline. [ D17. ] The dollar rose mildly in light trading. Gold fell $6.90 an ounce on the Comex, to $398.40. [ D17. ] Yields rose on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds for the week ended yesterday. [ D21. ] Shares sold short and not yet covered rose 0.3 percent on the Big Board. On the American Exchange, short interest was up less than 0.1 percent.

us,The Games at a Glance,"Gymnastics The three, all from the same country, were separated by the smallest of differences. Vladimir Artemov edged teammate and his countryman, Valeri Lyukin, by one-tenth of a point yesterday to capture the gold medal and lead a Soviet sweep of the men's all-around gymnastic competition. Dmitri Bilozerchev was third for the bronze. Artemov, who has a history of faltering in major competitions, registered two perfect scores. In women's competition, the Soviet team, which remained well above the fray concerning the bronze medal, finished just above its chief rival for the gold. While East Germany and the United States traded charges in their squabble for third place, the Soviet and Rumanian athletes battled with grace and skill. In the optional portion, Yelena Shushunova posted perfect scores in the vault, uneven bars and the floor exercise to carry the Soviet Union to a satisfying triumph over the country that beat them in the world championships a year ago. The United States which lost the bronze to East Germany by three-tenths of a point, blamed its finish on an East German official who had invoked an obscure rule to penalize the American team five-tenths of a point in the compulsory segment. Basketball Around the track or up and down the court, it has never really mattered. Americans have always run well at the Olympics. The women's basketball team ran early and often and as a result Yugoslavia no doubt spent most of the second half wanting nothing more than to hide. The Americans led by 15 at intermission and by as many as 28 in the second half as they went on to defeat Yugoslavia, 101-74, and gain a spot in the medal round. In men's play, the Soviet Union, which had already lost to Yugoslavia, barely squeaked past Puerto Rico in overtime. Weight Lifting Mitko Grablev of Bulgaria was stripped of his gold medal and banned from the Games after testing positive for drugs. Grablev, who won the 123-pound class, was found to be using furosemide, a diuretic and one of the roughly 100 drugs on the I.O.C.'s banned list. Wrestling His hold on the audience was as good as his grip on his opponent. South Korean Kim Young Nam, a hometown hero, delighted a partisan crowd of his countrymen by outpointing Daoulet Tourlykhanov of the Soviet Union, 2-1, to capture the gold medal in the 162-pound class of Greco-Roman wrestling. Other gold medal winners included Jon Ronningen of Norway and Andrzej Wronski of Poland. Dennis Koslowski of Minneapolis took a bronze in the 220-pound class. Boxing The bout was rough and tumble, but not nearly as ugly as what followed. South Korean boxing coaches attacked a New Zealand referee after one of their boxers lost a decision to a Bulgarian boxer. Water bottles and at least one chair were thrown into the ring as referees, coaches and competitors roamed the canvas in confusion. The judges had awarded Aleksandr Hristov a 4-1 decision over Bun Jong Il in a 119-pound fight.",1988-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Following Doyle's lead, the impressionable Wade breaks into a house, goes to a parade where he spots the girl of his dreams and robs a bank. But while he is fleeing the bank, a car carrying the Governor's small daughter falls into the river, so Wade saves the child from drowning, runs away and hides the money - all this before lunchtime. Soon he finds work at a farm owned by the father of the girl of his dreams, a convenient place to roll in the hay, literally, while the town searches for the mystery hero.",1988-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Management seems completely receptive to the idea. ''He's done a marvelous job,'' said Carl Barger, the Pirates' president. ''I would have no problem with that. I couldn't be higher on him.'' Barger also indicated that he would like to rehire Leland's entire coaching staff of Ray Miller, Gene Lamont, Milt May, Tommy Sandt and Rich Donnelly.

Mota, the world champion from Portugal, easily won the women's marathon, jogging the final 100 meters with a raised fist and shining smile. Mota, who finished third at the Los Angeles Games in 1984, completed the course in 2 hours 25 minutes 39 seconds. Lisa Martin of Australia captured the silver and Kathrin Doerre of East Germany the bronze. In other events during the first day of track and field competition, Jackie Joyner-Kersee built a 101-point lead after two events in the women's heptathlon. Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson advanced to the semifinals in the men's 100-meter dash. Swimming It is a reversal of the standard behavior at wishing wells, but it has nonetheless allowed Matt Biondi's dreams to come true. Biondi takes gold and silver out of the water at Olympic Park. The American swimmer won his fourth medal of the Games when he finished first in the men's 100-meter freestyle. Biondi, who has a chance to come home with seven medals, won his second gold in an Olympic record time of 48.63 seconds. In women's competition, Janet Evans, acknowledged as something of an aerobic wonder, had her breath taken away when she got a look at the clock after the 400-meter freestyle final. Evans, the California high school senior, shaved an astonishing 1.6 seconds off her world record, finishing in 4 minutes 3.85 seconds for her second gold of the competition. Volleyball The United States women, already in trouble in their effort for the gold medal, found themselves in danger after four games against Brazil. However, they managed to remain in the race for medals. The Americans won the final game against Brazil to complete a 14-16, 15-5, 15-13, 12-15, 15-7 victory. Gymnastics Yelena Shoushounova stood at one end of the long runway to the vault understanding that anything less than perfection would have meant something less than gold. Shoushounova then promptly nailed her vault and got to hang the top medal from her neck. The Soviet gymnast produced a perfect 10 in her final apparatus to capture first place in the women's individual all-around competition. Rumania's Daniela Silivas was just .025 points back in claiming the silver. Weight Lifting The Bulgarians, who have dominated both the competition and the headlines concerning drugs at these Games, won another gold medal when Borislav Guibikov took first place in the 165-pound class. His combined total of 805 pounds easily topped the silver medalist, Ingo Steinhoefel of East Germany. Boxing The bout was rough, but not nearly as ugly as what followed. South Korean boxing coaches attacked a New Zealand referee after one of their boxers lost a decision to a Bulgarian boxer. Water bottles and at least one chair were thrown into the ring as referees, coaches and competitors roamed the canvas in confusion. The judges had awarded Aleksandr Hristov a 4-1 decision over Bun Jong Il in a 119-pound fight.

us,NEWS SUMMARY,"International 2-5, 28 Two groups claim to lead Lebanon now that the Presidency is vacant. A Christian-led Cabinet and a Moslem-led Cabinet each claimed to be the legitimate government, raising new fears of civil war. Page 1 Progress was reported in arms talks between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze toward resolving U.S.-Soviet differences that are holding up new negotiations on reducing conventional weapons. 1 A U.N. team may enter Namibia, South Africa said, to start planning the deployment of United Nations military and civilian personnel there once the territory's transition to independence begins. 2 A major cause of the Haitian coup last week was a terrorist attack against a church six days earlier. The incident appeared to undermine Government authority in the eyes of many citizens. 4 Salvadoran troops killed 10 peasants in a village 30 miles from San Salvador, relatives and neighbors of the victims say. A spokesman for the armed forces first said the villagers were ''subversives'' killed during ''fierce combat.'' 3 A furor has erupted in Nicaragua over a statement by the House Speaker, Jim Wright, that the C.I.A. is manipulating opposition political parties, which the Sandinistas say proves their much-repeated contention. 3 A provisional government in Chile would be established immediately by the oppostion if Gen. Augusto Pinochet does not win the plebiscite on Oct. 5, a Chilean Communist Party leader asserted. 3 A formula for a Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that would seek to be placed under U.N. trusteeship and would not necessarily recognize Israel is close to being agreed upon within the P.L.O. 4 Thousands waited to wish Hirohito a speedy recovery from his illness, standing in a line that stretched for blocks outside the gates of the Imperial Palace to sign get-well messages. 5 A Mexican priest will be beatified by the Roman Catholic Church, making him the nation's first modern candidate for sainthood. Because the Government shot him 60 years ago, the action could also create political tensions. 4 National 6-8, 34-35 A House vote to limit textiles imported by the United States was 17 votes short of the two-thirds needed to override an almost certain veto by the President. The Senate approved the identical bill last week by 59 to 36. 1 A drug that induces abortions was approved for sale in France. The drug, RU 486, is expected to replace as many as half of all surgical abortions in France. 1 Michael Deaver was sentenced to a suspended three-year prison term, placed on probation, fined $100,000 and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for lying about his lobbying activities. 1 Charred Yellowstone has new charm, official say. As nature restores the trees and meadows that have been destoyed by wildfire, tourists will be asked to visit ''nature's laboratory.'' 6 The House passed an AIDS bill that calls for spending $1.2 billion over three years to combat AIDS through testing, counseling and research. A previously approved Senate bill emphasizes education of the public. 6 The resignation from the A.C.L.U. by the Attorney General in 1969 was prompted, a member of the group at the time said, by a coming government appointment, not because he thought the group had a political agenda. 7 The Food and Drug Administration proposed that standardized absorbency testing and labeling for tampons be established to help women minimize their risk of toxic shock. 8 Sleep loss said not to harm medical residents' work 6 Navy instructor guilty of negligent homicide in death 6 Filibuster on minimum wage withstands second assault 7 U.S. charges executives in health care kickback scheme 8 Politics 34-35 Dan Quayle has not moved opinions toward one Presidential ticket or the other in one Midwestern town in Ohio, which is fortunate for Republicans because many voters do not think much of Mr. Quayle. 1 Michael Dukakis would not use taxes to pay for many of his Government programs, economists say, pointing to his three most important economic-policy proposals, which rely on businesses and the beneficiaries of his programs. 34 Bentsen invades Quayle territory 34 Regional 29-32 An operating license for Shoreham should be issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a Federal licensing board recommended. 1 A sentence in the Howard Beach case was handed down to Robert Riley, a principal assailant, who was given a six-month jail term and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. 29 Four inspectors were sentenced in New York City after having pleaded guilty to soliciting bribes. The sentences ranged from one to eight months in jail. 31 A State Senator was indicted in New York on five counts of fraud after an investigation into allegations that the senator, Richard Schermerhorn, had taken contributions from organized-crime figures. 30 An overhaul of electronic cab meters in New York City's 11,787 yellow medallion taxis to make it easier for passengers to tell if they are being overcharged is planned by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. 29 New York City revenues declined, creating a $71 million shortfall in July and August, the Koch administration reported, saying fiscal flexibility could be limited. 29 The usher at St. Patrick's Cathedral who was killed in the church by a deranged man Wednesday night, used to regale and worry his wife with stories about ''weirdos'' coming into the cathedral from the streets. 31 Comptroller Edward V. Regan of New York State was questioned on fund-raising records showing that many of his contributions in the last five years were from companies doing business with his office. 30 The Grateful Dead are in town, and their fans, known as Deadheads and recognized by their long hair and tie-dyed shirts, have been hanging out near Penn Station, perplexing afternoon commuters. 29",1988-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Games at a Glance,"Track and Field Everything else had been broken -the world record, the Olympic mark, the American standard - so Ben Johnson completed the amazing collection of physical performances by cracking something really surprising: a smile. Johnson, the superb sprinter from Canada, left Carl Lewis in his tailwind and his world record in the past when he won the men's 100-meter dash in a breathtaking 9.79 seconds. Then Johnson, a man who goes about the business of rewriting track history with a grim seriousness, allowed himself the smallest trace of a smile. Lewis's disappointment was considerably more obvious. Lewis, who had the fastest times by far in qualifying for the finals, was left in the blocks at the start and then only to stare at Johnson's back. In taking the silver in 9.92, Lewis had to console himself with a new American record. In all, four runners finished in under 10 seconds - the first time that has been done. Florence Griffith Joyner of the United States set an Olympic record in the women's 100 meters when she ran her quarterfinal heat in 10.62. Swimming This is Kristin Otto's first Olympics. It is also, she promises, her last. Indeed, it would probably be greedy (to say nothing of being unfair) were she to perform in another. Otto, a 22- year-old from East Germany, won her fourth gold medal yesterday when she set an Olympic record in the women's 100-meter butterfly. Otto, whose remarkable efforts have been somewhat lost in the blitz and glitz of attention detailing every stroke and statement of Matt Biondi and Janet Evans, earlier won gold medals in the 100-meter backstroke, the 100-meter freestyle and the 400-meter freestyle relay. She has two remaining events and a reasonable shot in each. Biondi claimed his fifth medal and third gold when he anchored the United States world-record performance in the 400-meter freestyle relay. Volleyball They have blamed early starting times for their sluggish play so far in the tournament. Somehow, though, the American men's team rises when it counts and as a result will awake tomorrow to find themselves assured of a place in the medal round. The defending world and Olympic champions overcame yet another lackluster start to defeat France, 17-15, 15-6, 15-13, and run their record to 4-0. They are likely to face the Soviet Union or Brazil in the semifinals. Boxing American boxers, having absorbed both shock and embarrassment earlier this week, have been hit with very little of anything lately. Kenneth Gould of Rockford, Ill., extended the Americans' recent ring record to 7-0 when he easily outpointed Alfred Addo Ankamah of Ghana for his second victory of the tournament. Weight Lifting Once again, the ink was barely dry in the record book before a test turned up positive. Anguela Guenchev, who set three world records in the 148-pound class, became the second Bulgarian to lose his gold medal and world records when analysis showed he had been using a banned diuretic. In the wake of the latest embarrassment, the entire Bulgarian weight-lifting team was withdrawn from the Games.",1988-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Do they number 300,000 (one of the Reagan Administration figures), asks Mr. Clendinen, an assistant managing editor at The Atlanta Constitution, or three million (according to advocates for the homeless)? A tattered army, is it they who are defeated, or the America in which they cannot find housing? The purpose of this joint photographic project of the National Mental Health Association and Families for the Homeless is ''to raise the level of public awareness and concern over the plight of America's homeless population.'' Who are the homeless? According to this book, they are us: mothers, fathers, children, veterans, the aging, the sick, laid-off workers and - a rapidly increasing segment - the employed. Families in which both parents work live in tents or cars because they cannot afford basic housing. In black-and-white photographs that document the pervasiveness of homelessness around the country, it is the children - the smaller army within the larger - who appear the most vulnerable: a defiant girl eats from a metal bowl under a California overpass; a toddler, serene in sleep, lies beside his mother on a patch of grass in New York City. For individuals and communities that want to help, the book lists public and private ways to do so. The photographs - by Eugene Richards, Stephen Shames, Mary Ellen Mark, William Pierce and Eli Reed, among others, edited by the photojournalist Michael A. W. Evans - are also part of a traveling exhibit that will be at the New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, through Oct. 22.

In the spring of 1970, when college campuses around the nation were exploding in the wake of Kent State and Richard Nixon's bombing of Cambodia, Yeshiva University was faced with a dilemma. Should it close down, like other universities, or should it keep its doors open? Yeshiva's solution was appropriately Solomonic: it decided to close the college but keep its Jewish studies programs going. The incident is just one telling detail in this well-written and lively account of Yeshiva's first 100 years by Jeffrey S. Gurock, a professor of history at the school. For most of its life, Yeshiva has walked the fine line between American culture and Orthodox Judaism and come up with something unique - American Orthodoxy, which says Jews can be true to their traditions while playing full and active roles in the modern world. Mr. Gurock traces Yeshiva's history from a small Jewish school on the Lower East Side to a major university. I graduated from Yeshiva College in 1971, and I maintain strong personal and familial ties with the school. I found ''The Men and Women of Yeshiva'' worthwhile, not only because I am among those invoked in the title, but because the book has something to say to a much broader audience. After all, Yeshiva is only one of hundreds of universities, Harvard and Yale among them, that began with a distinct religious mission. While the religious dimension of many of the other schools is today but a memory, Judaism remains at the core of Yeshiva. That has not always made life easy for Yeshiva, but it has made it - and this book - interesting.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

No gold for foresight there. Today I am wired to $80,000 worth of video equipment and I am almost too hip to be happy. I can see those two Olympic moments not only with the clarity of hindsight - replay, slo-mo, freeze frame - but I can see them as a double exposure: Beamon's incredible leap was an expression of muscular joy that made possible the Smith-Carlos rage.

One competitor, a judoka, is allowed per country in each of eight weight classes. The strategy is to use an agressor's weight and momentum to your advantage (pushing when being pulled, pulling when being pushed) and defeat him through a series of holds and throws. Matches are 5 minutes long for men and 4 minutes in women's judo, which is a demonstration sport. Victories are determined by an ippon (a clean and forceful throw) or by points. Terms Ippon: Throwing a rival on his back or side, pinning him for 30 seconds or choking or arm-locking him into submission. Waza-ari: Given for a less-than-perfect throw or for immobilizing an opponent for between 25 and 30 seconds. Two equal an ippon. Yuko: A throw less than a waza-ari, or a hold lasting between 20 and 25 seconds. Koka: A hold lasting between 10 and 20 seconds or a throw that knocks an opponent to his hips. Han-soku make: Disqualification for repeated infractions. In one of the most humiliating penalties in sports, the offender must kneel for public dishonor by the officials. Infractions Penalties are levied at the end of a match if it is not decided by ippon. Infractions include: throwing an opponent with one leg entwined around the opponent's; using locks on joints other than the elbow; using an arm or hand on an opponent's face; stepping outside the contest area; grabbing the inside of an opponent's judogi; applying any hold that could injure the neck or vertebrae, and kicking or hand-slashing.

Fields stomped out of the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's ''City Lights,'' growling loudly, ''That man's no comedian, he's a [ expletive deleted ] ballet dancer!'' One recalls that tale after reading the newspaper columnist and novelist (''Fall Guy,'' ''Screwballs'' ''Funny Farm'') Jay Cronley's latest effort because, while a visit to the ballet figures in the story, there is no ballet dancer in the magical sense Mr. Fields intended - and this book needs one badly. The putative hero, John Grape, a novelist in the throes of divorce and divestiture, never dazzles us with fancy footwork, never elicits admiration of any sort, not even for his undeniable doggedness. Taken to the cleaners in the first chapters by his soon-to-be-ex-wife, Delores, Grape broods a bit and then grimly launches himself on a course of total reconstruction, removing or concealing everything she found objectionable about his life, from obesity to drunkenness, compulsive gambling to tobacco addiction. Then it's on to cosmetic surgery, hair transplants and a whole new identity so he can woo her (and, much more to the point, the divorce settlement) back again. The kicker - and also the source of some truly hilarious scenes - is that Grape's agent is out peddling this scheme as a book and a movie even while Grape is trying to pull it off. Will he succeed? We'd care a lot more if Mr. Cronley had given us a single reason why Grape deserves any better than he got in the courtroom opening. But he's such a relentlessly loutish, unlovable loser we find ourselves wishing we could warn Delores of what's afoot -if only she weren't such a hopeless ninny that we're forced to conclude they deserve each other.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Some experts are beginning to ask whether the thrift industry will survive the crisis. Others say that maybe it should not survive because the business has so changed that the traditional savings and loan association is obsolete. There are predictions, too, that Washington might seek to reorganize the industry, possibly merging the thrifts into the banking industry. Nathaniel C. Nash, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times discussed the thrifts' future with three experts: R. Dan Brumbaugh, a former economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and now a consultant in San Francisco; Gerald J. Levy, chairman of the Guaranty Savings and Loan Association of Milwaukee and former chairman of the United States League of Savings Institutions; and Richard T. Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital Inc. and former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank. Here are excerpts. R.

Now, with the greater war stilled by a ceasefire that took effect Aug. 20, President Hussein had deployed the full might of his forces - armor, helicopter gunships and, according to an official United States assessment, which Iraq denies, chemical weapons - in the lesser war against the Kurds in their mountain fastnesses.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

In this book of previously published essays on the strange and sometimes indigestible fruits of postwar American culture, Mark Crispin Miller, an associate professor in the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins, shows a goatlike intellectual appetite uncommon in an academic. Concentrating on television and its influence on culture at large, Mr. Miller is as comfortable discussing the metaphysics of ''The Cosby Show'' as he is meditating on Theodor Adorno. This amphibious quality is rare, although not quite so rare as the author's sometimes self-congratulatory prose tends to imply. Mr. Miller loves to examine the archetypes hidden in the images of mass culture. His hilarious and chilling close readings of commercials, the game show ''Family Feud'' and the Jerry Lewis telethon are, or will be, classics, and his remarks on television's effects on politics are eloquent and damning. His diary of the 1984 Presidential campaign is a field guide to the techniques of network news; sharp, funny and finally horrifying, it is a welcome companion to this year's race. Mr. Miller says that criticism such as his is ''the one action that could still counteract'' the distortions and philistinism of the ''culture of TV,'' a notion that suggests he leaves the ivory tower only through television's magic window. Perhaps as a result, half-baked assumptions and unreliable conclusions accompany brilliant insights. But for readers who can keep their heads while the author occasionally loses his, ''Boxed In'' is an extremely valuable and entertaining guide to our electric landscape.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

When Edith Iglauer, a frequent contributor to The New Yorker, went to British Columbia in 1974, she knew nothing of salmon fishing or the rigors of a fisherman's life. A year later, having met and married an eccentric local fisherman named John Daly, she began what was to become a four-year adventure, until his death, aboard a 41-foot troller. This graceful, well-written book is the record of her experience. In the beginning, fishing with John was anything but easy. An idealistic, feisty, deeply principled man with a near-religious love for nature and an aversion to cities, big government and bureaucracy, he had a system for everything, all of which Ms. Iglauer had to master. His was a difficult but exhilarating routine of 14-hour workdays, with stretches of 10 to 12 days at sea. Despite the cramped living quarters, inclement weather and repetitious domestic chores, life with John had its own special ease: spontaneous poetry readings at sunrise, excursions for berry picking, a soak in a wilderness hot spring. And there were always visits and shared stories with fellow fishermen. It is in the precise telling of these anecdotes that Ms. Iglauer reveals her marvelous eye for detail and her unerring ear for the quirky syntax of colloquial speech. Yet she is also able to make the technical aspects of salmon fishing - including the dangers of pollution and overfishing - an integral part of what is otherwise an elegantly understated love story as well as a quiet account of personal metamorphosis. Ultimately, hers is a plea for the respect of nature through the finding of our own humanity.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Moses, whose career accomplishments will stand out for years, faded in the sprint to finish just third. Amadou Dia Ba of Senegal was a stunning second. In the women's 100-meter dash, Florence Griffth Joyner, racing in an unusually understated outfit, turned in another flabbergasting time, capturing the gold in an Olympic record time of 10.54 seconds. Diving Gao Min of China made the entire morning's degree of difficulty appear minimal. Gao, with as much bounce around the pool as off the board, easily captured the gold medal in the women's springboard event. Gao, the world champion, totaled 580.23 points to win by nearly 50. Page 3. Swimming A couple of Californians got even more deeply golden as Matt Biondi and Janet Evans both won again. Biondi captured his fourth gold medal when he won the 50-meter men's freestyle. Evans, a high school senior, was again at the head of the class when she claimed her third gold in the 800-meter freestyle. Kristin Otto won her fifth gold, as a member of East Germany's 400-meter medley relay. Page 3. Boxing The American boxers, according to their coach, are finally putting punches together.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE MEDIA LAB: Inventing the Future at MIT, by Stewart Brand. (Penguin, $10.) Among the projects being pursued by the zealous denizens of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory is an artificially intelligent electronic newspaper that, anticipating its readers' interests, selects with them in mind. Stewart Brand ''does a good job of translating the arcane language of M.I.T. engineers into English,'' our reviewer, Lawrence Hunter, said last year, though at times he ''seems overwhelmed by imminent utopia.'' THE CHILD IN TIME, by Ian McEwan. (Penguin, $7.95.) One Saturday morning, on a trip to the supermarket with her father, 3-year-old Kate Lewis disappears. Devastated, her father, Stephen, is set mentally adrift, withdrawing from those around him as he embarks on a personal exploration of the meaning of time. Ian McEwan ''is something of a master at representing misery,'' Rebecca Goldstein said here last year. Though she thought the novel's ''powerful empathetic current [ was ] occasionally frozen over by something cold and overly calculated . . . we are carried to an ending as artfully conceived as it is poignantly realized.'' The same publisher has reprinted Mr. McEwan's novel THE CEMENT GARDEN ($6.95), in which four children hide their mother's corpse in the basement to keep from being institutionalized as orphans. In 1978 one reviewer said the book was evidence of ''an original talent that . . . can only advance and grow.'' THE FIREBRAND, by Marion Zimmer Bradley. (Pocket, $8.95.) The author of ''The Mists of Avalon'' retells the ''Iliad'' from a woman's point of view. This popularization, ''a very different vision,'' one reviewer said last year, ''is full of flesh-and-blood characters.'' FIRST CONTACT, by Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson. (Penguin, $10.95.) In 1930, the people of isolated valleys in the interior of New Guinea experienced a strange visitation of ''skymen,'' who turned out to be Australians seeking gold. Through photographs and narratives of the highlanders, the authors ''succeed here in re-creating one of the last great adventures of exploration on our planet,'' Michael Fobes Brown said in The Book Review last year. THE ANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE, by John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler. (Oxford University, $15.95.) Purveyors of the anthropic view - who believe that, by the very act of observation humans create the universe - have an easy answer for those who ask why the universe is so old: if it were any younger, carbon atoms never would have developed and we carboniferous creatures wouldn't be around to ask questions. The authors ''understand their subject very well indeed, and they have written a clear, rigorous and exhaustively researched book that promises - or threatens - to keep the principle kicking for years to come,'' Timothy Ferris said here in 1986. ''I was infuriated by it, disagreed with it and loved reading it.'' THE RIDDLE OF THE THIRD MILE, by Colin Dexter. (Bantam, $3.50.) A dismembered and beheaded body found in a canal is apparently that of an Oxford don. But as more bodies turn up, ''the plot assumes the complexity of a computer chip,'' Newgate Callendar said here in 1984. ''There has been nothing like it since the days of Ellery Queen. Preposterous? Perhaps. But also mischievous, tongue-in-cheek and an utter delight.'' EVERYTHING TO GAIN: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life, by Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. (Fawcett, $4.95.) When the Carters' combination memoir and self- help book was published last year, our reviewer, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, called it ''inspiring.'' ''They describe their last seven years with endearing honesty - and with the fervent wish that you, dear reader, apply to your own retirement or middle age the lessons learned by the involuntarily unemployed First Family.'' LITTLE EDEN: A Child at War, by Eva Figes. (Persea, $8.95.) The author of this recollection was 6 years old when she fled Germany with her family in 1939, settling in England, where she began her assimilation into British culture. Last year, our reviewer, Lore Segal, said the memoir of childhood and war was ''nostalgic and lyrical.'' NEW ISLANDS: And Other Stories, by Maria Luisa Bombal. (Cornell University, $6.95.) When this collection, translated from the Spanish by Richard and Lucia Cunningham, was published in English in 1982, our reviewer, Ronald De Feo, said these ''evocative, haunting stories,'' written in the 1940's by a Chilean, anticipated the magic realism of later Latin American writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez. GRAND OPENING, by Jon Hassler. (Ballantine, $3.95.) During World War II a family of newcomers tries to start a supermarket and a life in a small, xenophobic Minnesota town. ''Despite a few slow moments and stock secondary characters, this well-constructed novel effectively portrays human weakness and triumph,'' Gardner McFall said here last year. ''Without sentimentality, Mr. Hassler illustrates - in the spirit, if not the virtuosity, of Flannery O'Connor - that we often learn more about God from misfits than do-gooders or saints.'' LETTERS FROM THE COUNTRY, by Carol Bly. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Carol Bly's essays, written when she lived in Madison, Minn., with her former husband, the poet Robert Bly, are not aimed at city folk, Noel Perrin said here in 1981. ''These are letters to small towns [ and ] a very readable mixture of sociology, secular sermons and good stories. All are intended to raise rural consciousnesses.''",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

The ''great'' debates of Presidential politics have been, by and large, neither great nor, in many ways, debates. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communications at the University of Texas, and David S. Birdsell, who teaches in the speech department at Baruch College, review the history of debating in American politics and conclude that debates could be a lot more useful in helping voters to select Presidents. They would discard the format George Bush and Michael Dukakis are due to use tonight in their first of two televised debates, with reporters throwing questions. ''Lincoln, not a panel of journalists, posed the questions for Douglas and vice versa,'' they note in reference to the 1858 Senate debates in Illinois. The larger point is that debates are better designed to elucidate issues than to illustrate character. But in the rigid form evolved for Presidential campaigns, issues are rarely explored. The authors recommend debates that are more conversational, where more time is allotted for each answer and where a considerable block of time is devoted to a single topic. If they ruled the political world there would be at least three televised debates, each with a different format, supplemented by televised news conferences and televised speeches. Their proposals are at once reasonable and utterly romantic. Several were considered this year and rejected, largely by Mr. Bush, who saw no advantage to experiment. But debates are relatively new to Presidential politics, and their form and role may yet be susceptible to good ideas whose time has not yet come.",1988-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Ereng, a Kenyan who had hung back through nearly 700 meters, quietly burst from the back of the pack and into the lead to capture the gold medal in 1 minute 43.45 seconds. But throughout his surge, Ereng was misidentified as Nixon Kiprotich, his teammate from Kenya, by Charlie Jones, NBC's veteran track announcer. Ereng beat Aouita, the best middle-distance runner in the world, and Cruz, the gold medalist at the distance in 1984. But it was not until at least a minute after the result was official that Jones correctly announced Ereng as the winner. ''We just entered the world record book of blunders,'' said Jones. Cruz took the silver and Aouita the bronze. In the women's 800, Sigrun Wodars of East Germany claimed the gold with a time of 1:56.10. Her teammate, Christine Wachtel, took the silver and Kim Gallagher of the United States was third for the bronze. Basketball The United States women's team expected it would have to defeat the Soviet Union in order to win the gold. It didn't, though, anticipate having to beat the Russians just to guarantee winning something other than the bronze. Australia, the team from down under, stood the tournament on its head when it upset the Soviet Union, 60-48, to move into the semifinals against Yugoslavia. The loss for the Soviet women - their first ever in Olympic competition - set up a early showdown with the Americans in the other semifinal tomorrow. In the men's quarterfinals, the United States' pressure defense cracked apart another opponent's gameplan and the Americans spent the rest of the game waltzing through the openings. The Americans, sparked by Danny Manning's 18 points in the first half, raced to a 94-57 elimination of Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals. Volleyball The American women's team was ahead by 2 games to 0 against Peru when it was officially eliminated from the Olympics. Odd? Yes, but then the Americans had been faced with an unusual and extraordinary assignment. The United States not only had to beat Peru to gain the last spot in the semifinals. The United States had to beat them badly. And for a brief couple of minutes, the chances looked good. The Americans, who had to both sweep three games from Peru and hold them under 33 combined points, took the first two games while yielding only 21 points. But Peru's 12th point of the third game ended the American bid for a medal. Peru, which went on to beat its disheartened opponents, 3-2, joined China, Japan and the Soviet Union in the medal round.",1988-09-26T05:00:00+0000

The Hawks' general manager, Stan Kasten, confirmed yesterday that Washburn was suspended without pay until doctors clear him to return to basketball. Kasten said no decision has been made about replacing Washburn on the roster. The team could replace Washburn with a minimum salary player but Washburn's $777,000 contract will continue to count against the club's salary cap total. Washburn confessed to cocaine abuse during the 1986-87 season, while he was with the Golden State Warriors. Thus, he is one step away from being banned by the N.B.A. for at least two years in the event of a third offense. Washburn was acquired by the Hawks last Dec. 15. He worked 174 minutes while playing in 29 games for the Hawks. He averaged 2.0 points and was benched in the playoffs.(AP)",1988-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Club officials were silent after Sunday's announcement. Players didn't seem too surprised or concerned, and some were relieved. ''I think it's the best way for the organization to go,'' the pitcher Andy Hawkins said of Saturday's incident. ''Last night couldn't be overlooked.'' The obscene gesture was prompted by two fans who paraded along a stadium walkway during the seventh-inning stretch of the San Diego-Houston game with a banner urging the Padres' owner, Joan Kroc, to ''Scrub Chub.'' Feeney, 67 years old, who was in the owner's box, then waved and retreated to the rear of the box as a chorus of boos erupted from many spectators who witnessed the gesture. Feeney initially denied making the gesture, which was captured by television cameras. He issued an apology Sunday along with his resignation but said the two were unrelated. ''I was going to announce this Wednesday, but I figured I might as well do it now. I will not be coming back next year, not at all,'' Feeney said. ''This was a decision I made about 10 days ago.'' Kroc, owner of the Padres, was unavailable for comment Sunday. Vice President Dick Freeman declined to talk with reporters.(AP)",1988-09-27T05:00:00+0000
us,Patterns; Hue and Cry,"Color, like fashion, runs in cycles.

Taking the designers' lead, fashion magazines emblazon the new season's message in their headlines: ''Fall Flash,'' ''Full-Throttle Fuchsia,'' ''Shocking Shearlings,'' ''Color for a Change.'' Elle magazine headlined its September issue ''Knockout Color,'' and featured an essay on color by the French novelist Madeleine Chapsal, who wrote: ''I believe color is life. Color is also love.'' In keeping with such journalistic effusions, retailers seeking to revive sales have stocked displays that fairly scream with chromatic urgency. They hope that after years of neutral colors for daytime clothes, women will be ready to add some color to their closets.

Witnesses said the fan, identified as John Knapke, 25, of Dayton, Ohio, was stretching to catch the final extra point booted by the Cleveland Browns' kicker, Matt Bahr, in Sunday's 24-17 loss to Cincinnati when he fell 25 feet from behind a railing to a concrete runway. He was flown by helicopter to the University of Cincinnati Hospital, where he was reported in serious condition yesterday. Mayor Charles Luken has asked City Manager Scott Johnson to investigate improvements that can be made to prevent other such accidents. Those improvements could include using nets behind the Riverfront goalposts to keep kicked footballs from going into the stands, or raising the height of railings at the stadium, Luken said. . . . Bernie Kosar, the injured Cleveland Browns' quarterback, has begun throwing a football lightly as he continues his rehabilitation from a badly sprained elbow. ''He threw a football 20 times for 10 yards Friday,'' Coach Marty Schottenheimer said yesterday. ''They're going to continue with the rehabilitation.'' Kosar was hurt in the Browns' opening game at Kansas City when he was hit on the throwing arm.

Johnson, the Canadian sprinter who holds the world record in the 100-meter dash, now also holds the ignominious distinction as the most prominent athlete to have tested positive for use of a banned substance. The urine sample Johnson submitted Saturday after he captured the gold medal in the men's 100 meters, which he won in the astounding time of 9.79 seconds, was found to contain traces of an anabolic steroid. As a result, the International Olympic Committee voted unanimously to strip Johnson of his gold medal. Carl Lewis, who finished second to Johnson in an American record time of 9.92, was awarded the gold medal by the International Amateur Athletic Federation. That decision suddenly gave new life to Lewis's bid to repeat winning four gold medals as he did in 1984. Diving The dive was a reverse 3 1/2-somersault tuck. It was a lot more than that, too. Among other things, it was vintage Greg Louganis and the difference between upset and history. Louganis, requiring a spectacular dive to catch China's 14-year-old Xiong Ni, executed a perfect dive and thus barely edged his upstart rival for the gold medal in the men's platform competition. Louganis also became the only diver ever to win both the springboard and platform events in consecutive Olympics. He won both golds four years ago in Los Angeles. Boxing In a display of common sense rare for this implausible and unpredictable competition, Ken Adams, the coach of the American boxing team, warned his fighters to get their minds off the pot and on the gold. Common sense and Michael Carbajal quickly prevailed. Carbajal, the 106-pound boxer from Phoenix who had done his best to win the team's betting pool for the fastest knockout of the competition, earned a 5-0 decision over Scott Olson of Canada that was as convincing as it was sensible. The quarterfinal victory assures Carbajal of at least a bronze medal. Romallis Ellis, at 132 pounds, also advanced to the semifinals for the United States, beating Emil Tchuprenski of Bulgaria. Basketball It took a dozen years for the Soviet Union's women's team to suffer its first loss in the Olympics. It took only another roughly 48 hours for them to experience their first rout. The United States, getting a combined 53 points from Cynthia Cooper and Katrina McClain, easily handed the Soviet Union its second defeat in Olympic competition, 102-88, as the Americans advanced to the finals on Thursday. The undefeated Americans bolted to a 36-17 lead in the first half and comfortably withstood a pair of late challenges before putting the Soviet Union away for good. The Americans will face Yugoslavia, who they beat by 27 points earlier in the tournament, for the gold medal.",1988-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Following is the question, with his complete answer: Q. Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you met Secretary General Gorbachev, you have met with Mr. Shevardnadze, but for the last 40 years, Americans have been taught to regard the Soviet Union as the enemy. Yet President Reagan has signed two arms control treaties and he has promised to share ''Star Wars'' technology with the very country he once called the evil empire, so perhaps you could tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long considered as an adversary? BUSH: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open, be cautious, because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them, but I don't want to see us exporting our highly sensitive national security oriented technology to the Soviet Union. I don't want to see us making unilateral cuts in our strategic system, while we are negotiating with them, and so I'm encouraged by what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze.

According to Capt. George Dickscheid of the Newark Police Department, the 24-year-old Washington, a guard, was arrested by two policemen in Newark last Sunday after they investigated a car that was parked on the wrong side of the street with Washington in the driver's seat. Washington tried driving away but was blocked by a double-parked car, the police said. While questioning Washington, the police reported, they spotted several clear glass vials believed to be cocaine in a pouch on the inside of the driver's door. Washington was charged with possession of cocaine and possession of a controlled substance in a vehicle. He was released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond. Aside from a conviction, if there was evidence of cocaine or heroin use, the N.B.A could request permission from an arbitator to test Washington for drug consumption. If he tested positive, he would be banned from the league for failure to come forward. Brian McIntyre, an N.B.A. spokesman, said yesterday that the league was investigating.",1988-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Games At a Glance,"Basketball This game was taken from the Americans, too. Only it was taken from them both early and legally. No, the Soviet Union didn't need chaos to defeat the Americans. Its court order and strategic discipline were more than enough. As a result, the Soviet Union, which moved to a 10-point lead by intermission, had little trouble fending off a belated and erratic American comeback to beat the United States, 82-76, and move into the final of the men's competition. Sixteen years after the Soviet Union dealt the Americans their first defeat in Olympic play in a controversial and bitter 1972 game in Munich, it dealt them just their second loss fairly and emphatically. The Soviet Union was scheduled to face the winner of Yugoslavia-Brazil for the gold medal. On the women's side, Coach Kay Yow of the American team insisted the gold medal was not now going to be handed to her squad ''on a silver platter.'' The general consensus, though, is that it will no doubt eventually be handed to the team at the end of the standard ribbon. The Americans, who took apart the Soviet Union, 102-88, in the semifinals, only have to beat Yugoslavia - a team they trounced by 27 points earlier in the tournament - to claim their second consecutive gold. Track and Field Steve Lewis and his coach from U.C.L.A. stood in Olympic Stadium waiting to watch the photo finish of the men's 400 meters. Finally, the image was flashed on the screen and instantly the two became the picture of joy. Lewis, thought to be the weak link, turned out to be the golden boy. Lewis, the youngest, most inexperienced of the three American runners entered in the 400-meter final, also happened to be the best as he finished first in 43.87 seconds. Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder and prohibitive favorite from Ohio State, was second by a milisecond for the silver. Danny Everett was third for the bronze. In the men's decathlon, Jurgen Hingsen, the chief rival to the defending gold medalist, Daley Thompson, was disqualified from the 100 meters after his third false start. The West German protested, lost and withdrew from the rest of the competition. Volleyball The Soviet Union's women's volleyball team entered these Olympics almost entirely rebuilt, and now, its international stature has been largely regained, a process that took a shockingly brief hour to accomplish. The Soviet Union overwhelmed China, the defending champion, by taking three straight games, including a rare shutout, in the semifinal. The rout, in which the Soviet Union lost just 11 total points, moved the Soviet Union into tomorrow's final against Peru, a 3-2 victor over Japan.",1988-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Games At a Glance,"Track and Field For those who watch Florence Griffith Joyner run, the Olympics have been a blur. Already the gold-medalist in the 100-meter dash, Griffith Joyner ran to a world record on the 200-meter semifinals with a time of 21.56 seconds. Her sister-in-law, Jackie Joyner-Kersee fouled in her final jump and her last attempt to set a world record in the long jump. After all, her leap before had already taken her where no American woman had ever gone. Joyner-Kersee's jump of 24 feet 3 1/2 inches, an Olympic record, made her the first woman from the United States to win the Olympic long jump. It also completed a spectacular double for Joyner-Kersee, who last weekend won the heptathlon by some 400 points. Her victory in the long jump marked the first time an American women had won a field event in 32 years. Joe DeLoach, who as a teen-ager considered it a great thrill to get Carl Lewis's autograph, reacted with mixed feelings after he had outrun Lewis in the men's 200 meters. DeLoach, a friend and protege, upset Lewis by finishing in an Olympic-record time of 19.75 seconds. Afterward, DeLoach was torn, grateful for his success and saddened that it came at Lewis's expense. DeLoach's victory ended Lewis's bid to repeat his four-gold-medal performance of four years ago. Weight Lifting He may not have the irrepressible charm of Olga Korbut, but Aleksandr Kurlovich will return to their shared hometown in the Soviet Union with something Korbut never did: a gold medal. Kurlovich, a 292-pound sports instructor, earned the unofficial title of world's strongest man when he took first place in the superheavyweight class. He lifted a total of 1,017.5 pounds. Boxing The competition is there, said Kennedy McKinney. It just isn't there for long. McKinney stopped Pahjol Moolsan of Thailand at 2:32 of the first round. McKinney thus became the second of three American fighters to advance to the finals. ''The competition is there,'' said McKinney, who fights at 119 pounds. ''But I'm not giving them a chance.'' Michael Carbajal, too, will have a chance at gold thanks to his artful and aggressive 4-1 decision over Robert Isaszegi of Hungary. The 106-pound Carbajal, up against it after two rounds, backed his opponent in the third to advance to the final. Ray Mercer, fighting at 201 pounds, halted Arnold Vanderlijde of the Netherlands, the European champion, in the second round to earn a shot at a gold medal. A pair of American boxers, though, had to settle for bronze medals. Kenneth Gould lost a 4-1 decision to Lauraent Boudouani of France. And at 132 pounds, Andreas Zuelow of East Germany won a 5-0 decision from Romallis Ellis of Ellenwood, Ga. Basketball Kay Yow, who had been emphatic about not assuming success or celebrating early after her team beat the Soviet Union in the semifinals, could have begun relaxing anytime after the second half began against Yugoslavia. The United States women built a lead as large as 17 points in the second half on the way to a comfortable 77-70 victory over Yugoslavia and an untainted second gold medal. With no boycott this year, there was nothing less than full satisfaction for the Americans.",1988-09-29T05:00:00+0000

The front office, which used the expiration of Oh's five-year contract as a graceful moment to ease him out, appointed Motoji Fujita as manager. Oh, 48 years old, took full responsibility for the team's third-place finish in the Central League. ''I had expected this to come,'' said Oh. ''Over the past five years I have not been able to meet expectations, and I accept that. In this world of professional sports, you have to win. That's the bottom line.'' Oh's entire career was spent with the Giants, starting in 1959. During his 21-year playing career, the team won 13 pennants and 12 Japan Series titles, and Oh hit 868 home runs, exceeding the 755 by Henry Aaron and the 714 by Babe Ruth.

Competition is in singles and duet and is comprised of compulsory figures, done without music (55 per cent of the score), and routines, with music (45 per cent). Swimmers compose their own routines, which have time limits of 3 1/2 minutes for singles and 4 for duet. Underwater speakers allow the swimmers to hear the music. Look Good but Don't Touch Swimmers used an ''egg-beater'' kick, adapted from water-polo players, to tread water, and propel themselves by sculling with their hands. They cannot touch the bottom or sides of the pool. A panel of seven judges award from 1 to 10 points, with the highest and lowest discarded. Keep an Eye on . . .

Her eyes are so heavy with makeup it's a wonder she can blink. And her slinky black dress might make Cher jealous or Frederick of Hollywood blush. Cut up to her thighs and down to her navel, it is designed to expose Elvira's proudest comic prop, a gravity-defying bosom more believable on Jessica Rabbit than on any real-life woman. Elvira the spoofy-sexy witch (the persona of an actress named Cassandra Peterson) is not what you'd call a class act, but she is a successul one. She began by introducing old horror films on television in Los Angeles, and soon spread her trashy-comic image nationwide in syndication and on video. Like Pee-wee Herman, Elvira is a walking visual joke, a cult figure trying to break through to the mainstream. And if you had to ask about any of this, you don't want to see her movie.",1988-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,THE GAMES AT A GLANCE,"Track and Field The Games are nearing completion, but for Florence Griffth Joyner, it's all been a blur: a glorious, glamorous blur. Griffith Joyner, who sets world records with all the evident effort of someone going to the corner for milk, won her second gold medal when she took the women's 200 in a world-record time of 21.34 seconds. Indeed, Griffith Joyner, who has the world mark and the gold medal in the 100, can't even run qualifying races without lowering world bests. The world record she broke in the 200 final was the one she had set in the semifinals. In the men's decathlon, Daley Thompson of Britain, whose pole snapped in the middle of his vault, was left in midair and, for all intents and purposes, out of the race for the gold. Thompson, attempting to become the only man to earn medals in three Olympic decathlons, injured his hand and thigh in the mishap and was never the same competitor, finishing 22 points shy of the bronze medal. Christian Schenk of East Germany won the gold. Volleyball Three times, the women's team from Peru was one kill from the gold medal. Each time, though, the Soviet Union somehow came away with new life. Ultimately, it also came away with the gold medal. The Soviet Union, after having lost the first two games of the match to Peru, staved off three match points in the fifth and final game to gain the singular prize of the tournament, 10-15, 12-15, 15-13, 15-7, 17-15. In men's play, the American team needed just 70 minutes to eliminate Brazil and move into the gold-medal game against either the Soviet Union or Argentina. The United States, defending its Olympic title, won 15-3, 15-5, 15-11. Boxing Riddick Bowe took a shot to the body and, as he said, ''saw Brownsville all over again.'' As a result, he slowly began to see reason, as well. Bowe, the New York City boxer who is hoping to cash his gold medal in for a ticket out of the inner city, was knocked down in the first round of his superheavyweight semifinal fight with Aleksandr Miroshnichenko of the Soviet Union. But he survived the round, gathered his wits and started unleashing punches. Two rounds later, he was awarded a 5-0 decision. His move into the finals meant the United States would have six boxers poised for a gold medal. The others are Michael Carbajal, Ray Mercer, Kennedy McKinney, Andrew Maynard and Roy Jones. Wrestling Dan Gable, who in his day liked to mix it up in the wrestling ring, tries to keep it pretty simple when it comes to metaphors. Here then is Gable, the assistant coach of the American team, talking about John Smith and trying to pin down just the right image. Smith is, Gable said of the world champion, like air. ''And it's kind of hard to take air down,'' he said. Smith took the gold in the 136 1/2-pound class of freestyle wrestling when he shut out Stephan Sarkissian of the Soviet Unions, 4-0. Team Handball It was a small revolution in a largely minor sport. But it produced a major upset. The Korean women's team, whose young, small, but very fast squad befuddled opponents throughout the competition, surprised the powerful and heavily favored team from the Soviet Union, 21-19, to win the gold medal.",1988-09-30T05:00:00+0000
