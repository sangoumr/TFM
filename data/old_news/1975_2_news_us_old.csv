us,The Killer Mustang of the Knicks,"Once upon a time, like last season, the New York Knicks strutted through the National Basketball Association with the elegance of thoroughbred race horses or at least working jumpers. But now they've got a mustang in their midst. They would prefer to rope and brand Mel Davis, just for their own safety under the boards. But they don't dare. They've got to give Mel Davis his head, and his shoulders and his elbows. No matter who gets trampled. If the Knicks are safe, opponents would be safe, too. And the Knicks can't be that choosy anymore. The Knicks probably will qualify for the National Basketball Association playoffs under the new formula that includes the Eastern Conference's best thirdplace team. It's whispered that the new playoff formula was devised to assure that the Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers qualify in their seasons of transition, but the Lakers need a formula for a lastplace team. All the Knicks need is a better wonlost record than either the Houston Rockets, their opponents today at Madison Square Garden, or the Cleveland Cavaliers, whichever team finishes third in that division. To lump the Knicks, after all their glory years, with the Rockets and the Cavaliers explains what they are now. It also explains why they need their mustang.",1975-02-01T05:00:00+0000

It is like the recent work of Norman Mailer in its hero's attempt to sniff out and soak up the power, energy, magic or mana released by violence and fear.

So he wrote a novel about sharks and called it Jaws and became therewith the third Benchley in direct line of descent (son of Nathanicl, grandson of Robert) to slap the bestseller lists into the next county. This is what people mean by the term, typical American success story. At last report, total production costs on a movie version of Jaws, which was filmed last year on Martha's Vineyard, were approaching $15million. Growing up on Nantucket, Peter Benchley learned early that islanders considered the mako shark good to eat and other sharks thought the same about islanders. His research for the book taught him that there were 250 known species of shark, but he hadn't met any of them personally until last November when he went to Australia with a television crew. The ones he met there will be introduced to viewers Sunday afternoon at 3:30 on the American Broadcasting Company series, The American Sportsman.",1975-02-07T05:00:00+0000

Ali described his new life causefor all my championship fights from here on out, after I pay my taxes, after I pay my expenses and my helpers, I don't want no money. He mentioned that his earnings will be distributed by the United Negro College Fund, by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, by the Black Muslims, among other organizations. I got about $2million I can put my hands on for myself, he said. I got enough for me. But it won't be enough unless he organizes a foundation with honest supervision. It won't be enough unless the Internal Revenue Service approves the details of his donations. Joe Louis once thought he had all the money he needed, too. Ali's promise, while admirable, must be suspect until proven. Equally suspect is Ali's promise that he will rely on body punches to deflate Wepner, whose credentials as a challenger have been questioned by purists because of his tendency to bleed around the eyebrows. At least Chuck didn't bleed at the Plaza yesterday when the title bout in the Cleveland Coliseum was formally announced.

The movie was directed, written and photographed by John Waters, the Baltimore film maker responsible for ""Pink Flamingos"".A lot of people would say that Dawn goes from bad to worse, but it's just one of the dozens of often predictable reversals in ""Female Trouble,"" that Dawn sees herself as going from good to better, finally winding up in the electric chair for murder, an occasion she proudly describes as ""the page one of my life.""""Female Trouble"" is regional camp of very limited appeal, a movie that celebrates tackiness in a way that was revolutionary and sometimes very funny in the sixties when Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey did it. Now it seems almost provincial, though I realize that too could be interpreted as a plus by people who are willing to work very hard to rationalize small laughs.Divine, who looks like a hippo in drag even when he's not in drag, may not be an untalented comedian, though it's impossible to tell in a movie in which the second-rateness of everything is the point. In the Warhol-Morrissey films such as ""Trash"" and ""Women in Revolt,"" the wit and the idiosyncracies of the performers (Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, Candy Darling) had the effect of reversing the reversals, so that the films were funnier (and more serious) than was immediately apparent.Mr. Waters's actors work hard to achieve some of that same quality, but with one exception they never achieve it. The exception is an actress named Mink Stole, who occasionally displays a fine madness as Dawn's 14-year-old daughter who doesn't look a day less than 30.",1975-02-13T05:00:00+0000

Dwarf trees are recommended for home gardens as they do not require the greater space of fullsized trees and they are easier to care for. These trees are grown by nurseries where the fruiting variety is grafted on a dwarfing rootstock which controls the size. The fruit produced is normal size and the harvests are generous. Apples, pears, plums and sweet cherries are not selffertile and two different varieties of each fruit must be planted for crosspollination. Peaches are selffertile. The local office of Cooperative Extension can supply lists of recommended fruit varieties for the area. Grafted trees are available from many mailorder nurseries and from some quality local garden centers.

When he was born, somebody suggested to his mother that he be named George Washington Erving, but she replied, You have a baby and name him after George Washington.

But beyond that he is an old pro, with an attitude and an understanding that some players never develop. And for all his remarkable repertory on the court, he prefers to understate everything else.

us,Screen: Three Experiments of 1960's,"It's always fascinating to re-encounter experimental works after some years have passedto see them outside the period that seemed to frame them. I first saw Kenneth Anger's ""Scorpio Rising"" in 1965, and it's pleasing to report that it holds up very well. The movie is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room, and anyone who missed what was once called the underground should catch it.""Scorpio,"" made in 1963, mocks the motorcycle cult and the voluptuous toughs who worship their machines. Blue-tinted shots of Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" and pin-ups of James Dean alternate with glimpses of Cecil B. De Mille's silent ""King of Kings,"" and a Walpurgis party where genitals are plunged through a cardboard skeleton and mustard is squirted in a man's navel. The rock sound-track is hilarious: ""Wind Up Doll,"" ""She Wore Blue Velvet,"" ""Baby, You're Torturing Me"" and ""I Will Follow Him"" pound away throughout the proceedings, and there are flashes of some admirable abdomens. However, a few too many death's heads are included.Oddly enough, the references to the nineteen-fifties, which seemed dated and rather ponderous in 1965, don't make the film appear old-fashioned now. Admittedly, one then saw it in an unfortunate contextdraped in the mystique of the underground, when a number of inferior films employed some similar imagery, such as the juxtaposition of Christ and hipsters, or close-ups of all-purpose skulls. But after a decade's education in put-ons, one can savor the impudent freshness of ""Scorpio"" today.Jack Smith's ""Flaming Creatures"" (1963) has agedbut so has the print, hence it's hard to fully imagine what the impact would have been in 1966, when the film was judged ""indecent, lewd, and obscene,"" and the theater that showed it was closed by the police. (Also, I suspect that this print may have been cut.) Now, this lighthearted pantomime of a group-grope seems almost as genteel as your in-laws' home movies. Since many of the participants are male transvestites, some in quasi-Victorian costume, it's occasionally startling to see a real breast. Though the turn-ons are elderly, they're still amusing, and the film has acquired a historical interest.""Rite of Love and Death"" (1968) produced, directed written and performed by the late Yukio Mishima, was based on his fine short story ""Patriotism,"" which concerns a young lieutenant who committed suicide in 1936rather than fight against his friends and fellow officers who had failed in a military coup against the Government. Both the story and the film are intensely romantic about death, but the strength of the prose version springs from anticipation as the man and his wife prepare to kill themselves. However, the silent movie is mannered, creaky and unintentionally comica warped recording of ""Tristan and Isolde"" dispels the soberness that was intended.",1975-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Presently, his American publishers are hailing The Seven Days of Creation as a monumental novel and calling Maximov a worthy successor to Pasternak gad Solzhenitsyn.

Here she is talking about herself: Sometimes I dream I am in Belsen, sorting through a pile of bodies rather like a postal clerk until I reach one uncannily familiar  a starved woman at the bottom of the pile  it is myself. I somehow feel I ought to have pity on her, but I won't. She'd only ask for food I hadn't got. Emily Stone is a disturbing study of two prevalent personality types: the bleeding heart and the computer mind. Peter is a bleeding heart, not in the usual political connotation but in an entirely egocentric sense. Caving in is the only kind of commitment he can manage. Irony and style are his sole restraints; beneath these, he is a swamp of sentimentality. A theatrical suffering is his way of mourning for the lost paradise of his childhood. No one will ever love him again as his mother did, his mother who, in the zoo, made him see so vividly the stretch of the panther's neck and the anachronism of elephants.",1975-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,American Film Theater's 'Jacques Brel Is Alive ...',"""Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris,"" the American Film Theater's second presentation of the season, has less importance as a movie than it has as a public service for those people who somehow managed not to see the Off Broadway stage show during its nearly five-year run at the Village Gate.Maybe not. Maybe the people who did not see the original show chose not to. In that case they may now choose not to see this very fancified film version, which opened at selected theaters here yesterday and will be given two more performances today.The movie, directed by a young French-Canadian named Denis Heroux, tries very hard to recreate the sense of intimacy and spontaneity of the plotless show, which is actually 26 Brel songs performed by Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, Joe Masiell, a chorus and by Mr. Brel himself, who makes a fine and much too brief appearance in the film to sing one song.Mr. Heroux, with the obvious cooperation of Eric Blau and Mort Shuman, who conceived the original show and wrote the English translations of Mr. Brel's French lyrics, has transformed what was essentially a concert into an extravaganza of surreal images that keep messing things up. The images are vivid and disconnected to one another (good) but they inevitably wind up being visual translations of the lyrics (bad). It's a rather classy variation on the format employed by the old ""Hit Parade"" television show, though it's seldom as witty.I should admit that I've never been a Brel maniac. Some of his songs are most engaging, (""Timid Frieda,"" ""The Taxi Cab,"" ""Amsterdam"" and ""Carousel""), and some make one long for the lyrics of Rod McKuen as comic relief. Mr. Brel is something else as a performer, which is apparent here when he comes on after intermission to sing his own ""Ne Me Quittes Pas.""The song is not great, but the performance isdeadpan and pseudo-world-weary in the cabaret tradition of chansonniers, and Mr. Brel was one of the best until he decided officially to retire from performing to devote his full time to composing. Which was too bad.Other people take Mr. Brel's songs too seriously. Or, to put it another way, they lack that touch of redeeming ham that can sometimes make charming and even moving a truly rotten lyric about love or death or war or some other little flea in mankind's ear.Mr. Brel, you see, is inclined to write about rather large subjects, and the movie treats them so portentously it doesn't hesitate to give us a crucifixion scene. The song is ""Sons of . . ."" in which Miss Stone mocks Jesus for the world's ills, seriously, I think.Furthermore, the camera isn't always kind to the performers with the exception of Mr. Shuman, a burly, comic man with a fine voice and an aggressive way of singing that turns criticism into nitpicking. Miss Stone, a small, Giulietta Masina-type with a voice big enough to stop a clock at 300 yards, and Joe Masiell, who might be described as the romantic lead, are continually being caught in the act of hard-selling songs that ought to erupt with feeling.What's worseif not for me but for people who take the Brel lyrics to heartis that a lot of the lyrics are difficult to hear and understand.

us,"'Boss Nigger,' Black Western, Proves a Surprise","""Boss Nigger,"" the black Western that opened in neighborhood houses yesterday, is the kind of unpretentious, ramshackle movie that can be a pleasant surprise if you stumble upon it without warning. To anticipate it with pleasure is to put a hex on it, however. Such anticipation is a burden that movies of this sort immediately collapse under. You've got to discover them yourselves, which means that writing about them becomes a discreet form of public disservice.""Boss Nigger"" stars Fred Williamson, one of the more popular of the new crop of black actors. He also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the movie with Jack Arnold, who directed it. Unlike most leading actors, black or white, Mr. Williamson seems to possess a genuine sense of humor that hasn't yet been systematizedlike Burt Reynolds'sas part of a public personality. I have no idea whether Mr. Williamson is witty or not, though his movie is.In ""Boss Nigger"" he plays a bounty hunter who, with his black sidekick (D'Urville Martin), finds he has to take over the law office of a frightened frontier town in order to collect a debt. The West is that timeless West where it's always 1870, but the complications of the plot suggest the kind of West where Roy Rogers used to ride in the nineteen-forties; the villains are immediately identifiable, the heroes incredibly noble as well as bullet-resistant, and coincidence is a fundamental narrative device.The wit of the film is in Mr. Williamson's performance, which is an immensely self-assured parody of the Man With No Name played by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's films. Though the screenplay gives the supposedly comic lines to Mr. Martin, it's Mr. Williamson who is responsible for most of the good humor, ambling through the movie, doing the old Eastwood act of squinting, shooting and being irresistible to women with less effort than it takes most other men to select a tie.Most black Westerns either ignore race or make it the fundamental point of the movie. ""Boss Nigger"" somehow manages to do both quite successfully. There's a lot made of the bigotry of the small Western town in which the black sheriff operates, but the effect of Mr. Williamson's Eastwoodesque performance has less to do with his color than with details observed and gently sent skyhigh.",1975-02-27T05:00:00+0000
