us,"'MURDER: BY REASON OF INSANITY,' CBS DOCUDRAMA","MADE-FOR-TV dramas are notoriously partial to detailed portraits of psychopathic murderers, preferably based on a true story. The latest example, on CBS this evening at 9 o'clock, is ''Murder: By Reason of Insanity.'' For nearly two hours, a deranged man threatens and stalks his former wife until, as the title reveals, he gets to stab her to death in a brutish scene of violence. This is followed by some brief and unconvincing reassurances that minor changes in the law may help prevent similar situations in the future. Cut. Wrap. Take the money and run. As true-story treatments go on television, the script for ''Murder: By Reason of Insanity,'' written by Scott Swanton and Marjorie David, stays fairly close to the known facts. The film is based on a Newsday article, entitled ''Always a Victim,'' by Marilyn Goldstein. The case was also covered in a 1980 segment of CBS's ''60 Minutes'' series. And a note in the final credits, requiring a speed-reading degree to catch it, discloses: ''This motion picture is based in part on the interviews of Adam Berwid conducted by Lawrence Schiller.''",1985-10-01T05:00:00+0000

It is this largess that accounts for the presence within the city's walls of a considerable section of the population; for the residents of Manhattan are to a large extent strangers who have pulled up stakes somewhere and come to town, seeking sanctuary or fulfillment or some greater or lesser grail. The capacity to make such dubious gifts is a mysterious quality of New York. It can destroy an individual or it can fulfill him, depending a good deal on luck. No one should come to New York to live unless he is willing to be lucky. - ''Here Is New York,'' from ''Essays of E. B. White'' (1977) Wilbur never forgot Charlotte. Although he loved her children and grandchildren dearly, none of the new spiders ever quite took her place in his heart. She was in a class by herself. It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both. - The last paragraph of ''Charlotte's Web'' (1952) I am a member of a party of one, and I live in an age of fear. Nothing lately has unsettled my party and raised my fears so much as your editorial, on Thanksgiving Day, suggesting that employees should be required to state their beliefs in order to hold their jobs.

Then he went grocery shopping. He spent hours in the supermarket in the small town where he lived, comparing prices, examining new products, reading the fine print on labels - anything to spend time. Late every afternoon, he watched television, like a child watches it - staring with dull eyes. In the evenings, he would watch more television, sometimes falling asleep by its flickering light.

Much of the score of this 1953 Broadway hit was begged, borrowed or stolen from Borodin's ''Prince Igor,'' and that opera occasionally peers out at us through the cotton candy spun by the team of Robert Wright and George Forrest. Such logic, however, proved to be very shaky in the New York City Opera's new production, which had its first performance last night. Of this rather aimless show it may only be said - to resort to an ancient critical dodge -that if this is the sort of thing you like, you will like this ''Kismet.''",1985-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,PROSPECTS,"Housing Finally Starts Housing starts have been a disappointment this year. With mortgage interest rates down, housing activity should be up. Instead, housing starts soared to an encouraging 1.9 million unit annual rate in April and never hit that level again. But Rosanne Cahn, of Goldman Sachs Economics, says that housing may still wind up the year on the strong side of the ledger. She expects starts of single and multifamily housing units to total 1.85 million for 1985, solidly ahead of last year's 1.75 million units. The September number, due out next week, will show the housing sector's growing strength, said Mrs. Cahn. She expects a 6 percent jump in starts over the August level, the second strong monthly rise in a row. Michael Carey, of Citicorp Investment Bank, is also optimistic about this key sector. ''We expect housing starts to continue to rise through the fourth quarter,'' he said, as lower mortgage rates and gains in real personal income encourage home building and buying.",1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AN EVENING PERFORMANCE. By George Garrett. (Doubleday, $18.95.) Though best known for his historical novels - ''Death of the Fox'' and ''The Succession'' - George Garrett has also produced a large body of short fiction encompassing the American experience of the last 30 years. The stories collected here describe the conflicts of adolescence, romantic and domestic turmoil, life in small Southern towns, academic life and wartime experiences, and they range in manner from the naturalistic to the near-farcical. Never less than workmanlike, solidly traditional in form, Mr. Garrett's stories frequently sound the theme of human cruelty. ''Human beings are the foulest things in all creation,'' says a character in ''Wounded Soldier,'' while the boy-narrator of ''The Last of the Spanish Blood'' is made to confront his own potential for evil and violence. ''What's the Purpose of the Bayonet?,'' a powerful story of wartime, ends by indicting ''the whole inhuman race.'' This abiding misanthropy does, however, allow for the saving grace of humor. ''Bread From Stones,'' an amusing tale of a feckless gigolo, also forms a tiny critique of the American dream. Perhaps the best story in the volume, ''Texarkana Was a Crazy Town,'' tells of a likable former soldier who finds ''real life'' much more fearsome and wondrous than anything he had encountered in the military. With few exceptions, the stories seem defiantly ''unfashionable'' in style. In our age of pared-down realism, Mr. Garrett's flaws as a writer - a fondness for elaborate similes, an occasional straining after poetic effects and a general prolixity -are particularly noticeable.",1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000

MESSAGES FROM MILAN","MILAN IS THE FIRST place to spot new spring and summer fashions. And the 1986 season there, opening today, offers two basic themes - both, let it be said at the outset, subject to wide interpretation. There is the Orient, notably in the form of clean kimono shapes by Gianfranco Ferre and translations of handmade Japanese papers into exquisite silks and linens by Gianni Versace. Then there is something that might be loosely gathered under the heading ''safari cum military'' - jackets that includes a subtle cut by Giorgio Armani, a skirted look by Laura Biagiotti and the complicated patterning of a Complice outfit by Claude Montana that manages a camouflaged look via a photojournalistic collage. Throughout, there is also a renewed emphasis on legs through above-the-knee skirts, Bermuda shorts and pants that fit second-skin tight. Shoulders, though still emphasized, are evoluting. Designers have been walking about with clouds of shoulder pads - sticking them into jackets, pulling them out, snipping at them with scissors or, even, tossing them away. ''Shoulders still have to be important,'' as Armani put it, ''but somehow smaller.'' For sheer luxury, there are light, beaded jumpsuits by Versace, adorned with variations on the Japanese symbol for happiness. Ferre drops his restructured kimonos over what he calls his ''energy dress'' - a tank-topped slink of black leather pulled even tighter with a suede obi. At Krizia, Mariuccia Mandelli has paired down her signature big-shoulder shapes and shortened her skirts. ''The mood perhaps is military - but by that I mean the rigorousness and cleanness of uniforms emphasized with touches of white,'' she says.",1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000

It goes without saying that Ravi Shankar, the sitarist, is better known today than his brother - for reasons that cannot be entirely divorced from the Beatles' discovery of his art. It is not surprising that Zubin Mehta, conductor of the New York Philharmonic and Indian-born himself, invited Ravi Shankar to perform with the orchestra when the Festival of India launched its opening week in New York last month (the official nationwide starting date was in June in Washington).",1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Historians, to whom we once confidently entrusted the custody of our public memory of ourselves as a nation, have been unable to pull together the vast mountain of scholarship produced in the past quarter century and make of it a coherent and explanatory account of American life. Both readers and writers have been drawn or directed, by a variety of social and cultural mechanisms, to histories of their chosen or inherited group.

Stanley started across Africa from Zanzibar to rescue Emin Pasha, a German appointed by Gen. Charles George (Chinese) Gordon as Governor of Equatoria, a territory near the upper reaches of the White Nile plagued by the the Mahdist uprising, a messianic movement that had isolated the province. The privately financed expedition consisted of ''eight white officers, 623 Zanzibaris, sixty Soudanese armed as soldiers, four Syrians, 13 Somalis . . . stores supplied . . . as an advertisement by different manufacturers . . . and Stanley's Madeira.'' Emin Pasha wished to be left where he was. But Stanley, ambitious for another triumph after finding David Livingstone in 1870 and inspired by the press's fanciful portrayal of Emin Pasha's heroism, was determined to take the man to Cairo, where he feared an obscure end as a pensioned-off civil servant. In the end, Emin Pasha went, no match for the imperious egotist Stanley. He returned in service to the Germans, and was beheaded in the Congo in 1892. In the course of the two-and-a-half-year expedition, 655 people were abandoned along the way, and more than 80 died. After a dense scene-setting introduction, the novelist Olivia Manning launches her wry comedy of imperialism, a complicated tale of frustration, waste and boldness in which she distributes blame and praise evenhandedly, showing each character's absurdities and capacities. Manning, who died in 1980, worked on this book during World War II while undergoing many of the experiences she used to brilliant effect in her books about the Balkans and the Levant.",1985-10-06T05:00:00+0000

This time, Texas seems the ideal subject: vast, sprawling, and eclectic in population and geography, the state has just the sort of larger-than-life history that lends itself to Mr. Michener's taste for multi-generational epics; and the story of its emergence - from frontier outpost to proud flagship of the New South - personifies the sort of old-fashioned American values that the author likes to examine in his fiction.",1985-10-09T05:00:00+0000

The Circle in the Square's new production of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' is the barely living proof, if any were needed, that even performers as fetching as Anthony Heald, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Dana Ivey - or a playwright of the caliber of Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais - stand little chance against a director with his own set of self-aggrandizing priorities. As staged by Andrei Serban, this ''Figaro'' is first and last the Andrei Serban show; its subject is the director's artifice rather than that of Beaumarchais's civilization. The evening is most likely to be enjoyed by audiences with an undying nostalgia for avant-garde gimmicks of 10, even 20, years ago, as well as by those who prefer a ''Figaro'' more suggestive of the Three Stooges than Mozart.",1985-10-11T05:00:00+0000

They said that an Egyptian plane carrying the hijackers of an Italian cruise ship had been intercepted by United States Navy planes and forced to land at a United States-NATO air base in Sicily. [Page A1, Columns 1-6.] The four Palestinian hijackers had not intended to seize the cruise liner but did so in desperation after the crew uncovered their weapons, according to Israeli and Arab sources. They said the four had boarded the Achille Lauro for the purpose of getting into Israel at Ashdod, the next port-of-call. [A1:3-4.] Passengers from the Achille Lauro were quoted as describing how the hijackers had dragged an elderly American tourist from his wheelchair and fatally shot him in cold blood. The Italian Ambassador, Giovanni Migliudo, put together his account of the killing of Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old resident of Manhattan, after six hours of interviews with some of the former hostages. [A1:4-6.] International A Salvadoran leftist unit killed at least 40 soldiers and wounded 68 in a lightning raid before dawn at the main training base for Government recruits. [A3:1-3.] National Pentagon arms policy is inadequate, according to a Presidential commission that is preparing to recommend a major overhaul. David R. Packard, who was named chairman of the commission in June, said the panel had concluded that fundamental changes should be made in the Defense Department's organization to correct weapons problems involving poor quality, high prices and long delays in purchasing.",1985-10-11T05:00:00+0000

It's a vision of the world as a dangerous, predatory place, peopled by two sorts of individuals - sophisticates and innocents. And while Miss Brookner always sides with her naifs - in each case, a Pym-like spinster, diligent, correct and impeccably earnest -she also makes it clear that she regards them as losers in society's hypocritical games. It's the careless, tempestuous people who get ahead and who win the love of others - not her discreet little heroines, who seem doomed by their own good intentions.",1985-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Harper. 97 pp. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. Cloth, $12.95. Paper, $6.95. A POET who fashions an extreme individual style, as Robert Bly surely has done, may find he has forged his own manacles to a limited means of expression. Whatever his subject or emotions, his poems may melt together in a monochrome haze. The ostensible subject of ''Loving a Woman in Two Worlds'' is romantic love, but many of the poems - even those containing the phrase ''man and woman'' - are hard to distinguish from Mr. Bly's other poems of landscape and mystic reverie. The verses become creatures of a habit not necessarily their own. The problem is aggravated by the kind of idiom Mr. Bly has fabricated. So many lines weighted with reverent pauses, stolid with monosyllables, muffled by end stops, can make poems not suggestive but stonily incommunicative. There is too much easy Orientalism, as in ''The Turtle'': Rain lifts the lake level, washing the reeds. Slowly the milkweed pods open, the yellow lily pads. Through the mist man and woman see the far shore. The turtle's head rises out over the water. In ''The Roots'' and ''The Hawk,'' he is still playing Tarzan; and he still takes flying leaps - ''I float in the current, calm and mad as a sleepy cork.''",1985-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Two principal British ticket agencies that have offices in New York will book tickets in advance. They are Keith Prowse (212-398-1430) and Edwards & Edwards (212-944-0290). In addition, there is the Group Sales Box Office for buying 20 or more tickets. It has numbers in New York (212-398-8383) and London (011-44-1-930-6123). It is frequently possible to get tickets to shows that seem to be sold out. In this, as in other ways, hotel concierges have been known to work magic. A booth in Leicester Square sells half-price tickets on the day of performance (open matinee days from noon to 6:30 P.M. and Monday to Saturday from 2:30 to 6:30). Otherwise, for performances at the National Theater, the Royal Opera House and the Coliseum, you can get in line before 10 A.M. and try to get one - they sell only one to a customer - of the small number of tickets held back each day.",1985-10-13T05:00:00+0000

It starts with the first rooms constructed in London particularly for the pleasure of ''lovers of musick'' and ends with 20th-century world's fair pavilions specially devised to house works by Edgard Varese and Karlheinz Stockhausen. In between it delivers a feast of revelations, like Friedrich Gilly's project for the Berlin Schauspielhaus, Ernst Haiger's Symphoniehaus or Harvey Lonsdale Elmes's titanic St. George's Hall in Liverpool, England, and of pleasures, like its thorough documentation of the Neues Gewandhaus in Leipzig, East Germany.

These criticisms mean that writers judge what they do by standards they continually fail to satisfy - as if, with the best will in the world, their works cannot lead them to that dreamed-of grace. The idea is that, like Tolstoy (or his inspiration, Harriet Beecher Stowe), we could effect good things and momentous things by the use of our pens, if only we could break out of preoccupations we scourge as indulgent, trivial or safe.

All the scoring yesterday occurred late in the final quarter, when Tom Bill hit Tim Apgar with a 23-yard touchdown pass and when Kendall Williams ran in from the 16 to complete a short drive set up by a fumble recovery by Ken Puttlitz.","Undefeated Eastchester (3-0) watched its 14-0 lead evaporate in the second half but held on to defeat visiting Westlake, 22-15, in a see-saw battle yesterday.

The time would be spring or summer next year. - E. K., Randallstown, Md. Answer:Several wholesale tour companies that specialize in Israel have long experience of arranging this kind of trip, which is sold through travel agents. Generally, they don't deal directly with the public. Among such companies are: Unitours (60 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10165; 212-949-9500), Isram (630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-661-1193) and Foreign Tours (5 Penn Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10001; 212-947-9595 and 800-223-7500). A tour by minibus, larger bus or limousine usually starts in Tel Aviv and stops for overnights in Haifa, Tiberias and Jerusalem, with accommodations in first-class hotels. Most Israeli hotels provide a full buffet breakfast that is included in the rate. Company representatives said the land cost of an escorted tour would be about $100 to $150 a day a person, depending on the hotels used, and would include sightseeing. They said that while the current round-trip, New York-Tel Aviv air fare was $799, fares varied according to season.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE TIGER. By Lisa St Aubin de Teran. (Franklin Watts, $16.95.) The third novel by this prize-winning young British author is her most ambitious and most imaginative. Like her first book, ''Keepers of the House'' (first published in the United States as ''The Long Way Home''), ''The Tiger'' unfolds against the decay and drought of an unforgiving Venezuelan landscape. But whereas ''Keepers'' and its successor, ''The Slow Train to Milan,'' dealt with a young Englishwoman married to a Venezuelan (as the author once was), ''The Tiger'' partakes less of autobiography and more of the mysticism and legend that are popular symbols of South America. Its protagonist, a German family scion born in 1911 and known simply as Lucien, grows up under the tutelage of his grandmother, Misia Schmutter, a despot who rules her Venezuelan estate as if she were a spider who spins a web not so much for killing (although she does this too) but for the fascination of power. She molds Lucien to her will, and after dying becomes a supernatural presence clinging to his back like the predatory tiger the boy once killed. But while her creed seems vaguely fascist, it is transmuted by Lucien's somewhat gentler spirit into a kind of existential obsession with pure action. This is, in fact, a story of obsession: Misia's for order and the will; Lucien's for architecture, gardens and gambling, and those of other characters, whose feelings range from love to bitterness.",1985-10-13T05:00:00+0000

''UNEXPECTED'' is the crucial word in Lenore J. Weitzman's subtitle. It goes along with its mates - ''unintended'' and ''unfortunate'' - to describe the results of the new divorce laws.

us,  Payments Supported,"Wilt Chamberlain, recalling that he was secretly paid $4,000 to play basketball at the University of Kansas 30 years ago, said yesterday that a system of standardized payments for college athletes should be established to keep them from being corrupted by unscrupulous boosters. ''It's time to revamp the codes and be more honest,'' he said. ''These players need money to live and go to school and learn. And they shouldn't be forced to take money under the table and make them do illegal things at such an early age.'' Chamberlain, who played at Kansas from 1955 to 1958, said he had received the cash from Jayhawk boosters known as ''godfathers'' at the school. ''I had two or three godfathers,'' he said. ''That way I wasn't sure where the money was coming from. Everyone was assigned at least one godfather when I was at Kansas.'' Told of Chamberlain's remarks, Doug Vance, the director of sports information at Kansas, said, ''There's no such program in existence now.'' Chamberlain, who suggested a standardized system that would allow colleges to pay athletes a legal stipend of $300 to $400 a month, was reluctant at first to say just how much he had been paid at Kansas. ''It would make it look like I wasn't worth very much,'' he said. Actually, the figure is somewhat misleading. The $4,000 Chamberlain said he was paid in the late 1950's would be worth some $16,000 today, or close to the $18,000 that Kenneth Davis, the suspended Texas Christian running back, said he was paid by T.C.U. boosters. . . .

Anne Rice has what might best be described as a Gothic imagination crossed with a campy taste for the decadent and the bizarre. Her last novel, ''Cry to Heaven,'' was about castrati; and her latest novel, ''The Vampire Lestat,'' is about - what else, vampires. It's not just the exotic subject matter that makes these books feel so baroque; it's Mrs. Rice's whole sensibility and use of prose. She loves to sling around phrases like ''Children of Darkness'' and ''the Devil's Road''; displays an equal fondness for such words as ''chaos,'' ''ecstasy'' and ''death'', and she likes to give her characters romantic names like Armand, Gabrielle and Marius. Reading ''The Vampire Lestat,'' in fact, is a lot like spending an entire day in a museum featuring only works by Henry Fuseli - all hung in heavy, gilt frames decorated with curlicues and malicious cherubs. By the end, you're reeling from both the strangeness and the surfeit of ornamentation.",1985-10-19T05:00:00+0000

The attitude of concert artists toward the new phenomenon might best have been summed up, though, by Ossip Gabrilowitsch, then conductor of the Detroit Symphony. At a social gathering one evening at which the indefatigable George Gershwin was, typically, demonstrating his piano prowess for hours on end, Gabrilowitsch began to beat an early path for the door when someone asked him what he got out of jazz.

It's a dark fable, a literary western by a serious young writer, that employs the town's tribulations - and the mayor's attempts to record them - to explore grand themes: the nature of American culture, the mortality of men and their civilization, the eternalness of art. ''The letter was from Texas,'' Doctorow says, ''and obviously from an elderly woman, written in a shaky hand.

I have agreed to pay my landlord a 10 percent rent increase; now, he tells me I am required to tell him how much my tenant pays me. Is this true? . . . D.K.B., Manhattan Answer: There is no requirement in the rent-control law for you to provide rent information about an additional occupant, says Thomas Viola, assistant commissioner for public information in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. A Question of Stabilization Question: I've lived in my apartment since 1972. All my leases have followed the rent guidelines for stabilized apartments. My building, which has five units, and the building next door, which has three, and a third building, which has eight, all share a boiler that provides heat and hot water. The new owner says my building is not stabilized because it does not have six or more units and is offering a lease with a 50 percent increase. Could this be? . . . J.T., Manhattan Answer: If the heat and hot water are supplied to all three dwellings Redinger from one source then, based on past housing policy decisions and court cases, you probably reside in a rent-stabilized apartment, according to Mr. Viola. Your case would have to be determined by the state division or by a court should the landlord pursue it there.",1985-10-20T05:00:00+0000

Will the concessionaires of the campgrounds honor our Golden Age Passport, issued by the National Park Service, which provides 50 percent discounts on camping fees? - G. L., Oakdale, N.Y. Answer:The two campgrounds within the park on St. John, Cinnamon Bay and Maho Bay Camps, are under no obligation to honor the Golden Age Passport, which is issued by the Park Service and the Forest Service to citizens age 62 and over. Holders of the pass are given discounts on fees for camping and use of boat facilities operated by the two services. The Cinnamon Bay site is on National Park Service land but it is managed by RockResorts, the hotel corporation founded by the Rockefeller family. Maho Bay is on private land within the park, is owned by a private company and has no legal relationship with the Park Service. (Cinnamon Bay offers tent cottages, tents and tent sites: Maho has tent cottages.) According to Duncan Morrow, an official of the Park Service, a few campgrounds in national parks within the 48 states have been turned over to private concessionaires on condition that they honor the Golden Age Passport.

Some of the natives recall the 1938 disaster, but Hurricane Gloria was my first experience with a misplaced tropical storm. I offer 10 perceptions gained by living in Gloria's path. 1. Having remained glued to the television, then to a battery-operated radio before the storm arrived, I conclude that when anticipating a potential disaster, one will listen eagerly to the same information no matter how many times it is repeated. 2. Of the things one hopes to accomplish in the time off bestowed by a storm, all require electricity. 3. Abe Lincoln deserves more credit for his willingness to study by the light of a flickering fire. 4. The least romantic hardship of lack of electricity is living without the pump that assures us of running water. 5. The luxury most taken for granted in America is the flush toilet. 6. Ben Franklin advised us that after three days, guests, like fish, begin to smell. A refrigerator deprived of electricity can accomplish it in less than that. 7. Just as there is more than one way to skin a cat, there is more than one way to clean out a refrigerator, the most thorough and least satisfying of which is tossing out a freezerful of spoiled food. 8. Cheerfulness has a correlation to the length of time since the last shower. The longer it has been, the more disagreeable one becomes. 9.",1985-10-20T05:00:00+0000

Our reviewer, Norman Davies, said last year that the book ''examines Milosz's state of mind and intellectual preoccupations,'' and it ''exudes the defiant stance, the freedom of spirit and the depth of cultural commitment of his homeland.'' Translated from the Polish by Louis Iribarne. THE CRAZY KILL, by Chester Himes. (Allison & Busby/Schocken, $5.95.) Chester Himes wrote close to 20 novels, and he is best known for his Harlem detective series. In ''The Crazy Kill'' - reportedly the author's favorite - a theft and a defenestration stir the intrepid detectives Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson to action. In 1959 our reviewer, Anthony Boucher, called this one of Himes's ''wild caprices of Harlem crime'' and ''a perverse blend of sordid realism and macabre fantasy-humor.''",1985-10-20T05:00:00+0000

I speak of a time before ''Burnt Norton'' appeared, when Joyce's ''Ulysses'' had just been published in the United States - to the shocked fascination of Miss Hughes, my charming, encouraging English teacher in Cleveland, where in 1933-34 my stepfather had a job. The year before, we had lived in Boston, where my previous little gang and I had taken to Eliot over the dead bodies of our teachers.

It was the trauma that changed all literature, demanding that writers find a new esthetic language for describing a civilization whose pieces could never be put back in coherent order again. In Stephen MacDonald's ''Not About Heroes,'' the new play at the Lucille Lortel, we are invited to spend an evening with two pioneers in the art of antiheroics, the English soldier poets Siegfried Sassoon (1886-1967) and Wilfred Owen (1893-1918). Yet, curiously enough, ''Not About Heroes'' is itself written as if the war didn't happen: the evening often seems more like a genteel Edwardian theatricale than a jagged modern excavation of the bloody waste land.",1985-10-22T05:00:00+0000

The season's first performance of ''La Traviata'' last evening could easily be entered in evidence to support such a contention.

This weekend, the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens is presenting a program of films by one such figure, Alice Guy-Blache, the first woman film maker. Miss Guy-Blache started making movies in 1896 in France, and later came to the United States to become the first woman to own and operate a movie studio. From 1910 to 1914, she supervised the production of more than 350 films - at least 35 of which she directed herself - under the auspices of her studio, the Solax Company, which began in Flushing, Queens. The current series of programs honors the 75th anniversary of the Solax Company. Being screened tonight at 7:30 will be ''Greater Love Hath No Man,'' ''The Detective's Dog,'' ''His Double,'' ''Canned Harmony,'' ''The Girl in the Armchair,'' and ''Beasts of the Jungle,'' an extravagant production that reportedly cost more than $18,000 and has the distinction of featuring the first scenes in which actors, lions and tigers appeared in the same shot. On Saturday at 7:30 P.M., the program is ''Officer Henderson,'' ''The Burstup Homes Murder Case,'' ''A House Divided,'' ''Matrimony's Speed Limit'' and ''Brennan of the Moor.'' The screenings will be in the Zukor Theater at 34-31 35th Street of the Kaufman Astoria Studio Complex. Tickets are $4. Information: (718) 784-4742.",1985-10-25T05:00:00+0000

At the top end of the price that analysts are estimating, U.S. Steel would pay about $5.2 billion. [Page 33.] Texas Instruments lost $82.8 million in the third quarter and said it would lay off 2,200 more employees. The loss, which included a $63.8 million writedown for plant closings and layoffs, put the company in its deepest financial crisis since a foray into home computers cost it hundreds of millions of dollars two years ago. [33.] Monsanto plans to take a $559 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter for divesting itself of certain assets, withdrawing from several low-return businesses and cutting its work force. [35.] Ford earnings fell 17.5 percent, to $313.1 million, in the quarter, hurt by cut-rate financing programs. Analysts said the results were about what was expected. [45.] Delta Air Lines said profits dropped 51 percent, to $29.5 million. [45.] Aetna operating earnings soared 36.8 percent, to $111.5 million. [45.] Armco's 62-year-old chairman, Harry Holiday Jr., will retire on Jan. 31. His successor will be Robert E. Boni, who will remain president and chief executive.

George Grey, the hero of Jonathan Raban's new novel, has spent the better part of his life on the road - moving from city to city, country to country, one set of rented rooms to another. He believes that ''the safest way to live was to assume that your marching orders would arrive tomorrow,'' and having lived so many years ''a lodger in other people's houses,'' he's ''picked up the lodger's habit of passing through without leaving tracks. He'd been born in a rectory that belonged to the Church and gone on to Navy quarters and Company apartments; and he left each billet exactly as he'd found it.'' If such a restless life has freed him from responsibilities, however, George has also begun to realize that it's made him a stranger to his family and friends - he has become one of those unannounced, nervous-making guests who drop by in the night and then are gone the following morning. At the age of 60, he decides to leave Bom Porto, the small African nation where he's lived for the last couple years, and return home to England.",1985-10-26T05:00:00+0000

A novel about Germany from the invasion of Poland to the fall of Berlin and, more specifically, two industrialist brothers who survive World War II by following different paths. In 1962 our reviewer, the British journalist Richard Hughes, termed ''The Birthday King'' a ''haunting and terrible book.'' He continued, ''Gabriel Fielding has turned his brilliant and precise genius to a ruthless examination of 'Hitler-Time' in Germany, skillfully interweaving fiction with historical fact.'' THE BURN, by Vassily Aksyonov. (Aventura/Vintage, $9.95.) ''The Burn'' sheds light on everyday material life in the Soviet Union in the late 1960's and early 70's. Yet as the author sees it, Russians, like everyone else, must go beyond mundane existence to a saving vision of past and future. Last year our reviewer, Anatole Shub, wrote that ''The Burn'' is the novel ''of a unique writer, at the height of his powers. . . . It is in turn hilarious, tragic, evocative, mystical.'' Mr. Aksyonov, who now lives in Washington, was forced to emigrate from the Soviet Union when ''The Burn'' was published in Italy. Michael Glenny did the translation. OUT OF THE FORTIES, by Nicholas Lemann. (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) In 1943 Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon) commissioned outstanding photographers to record ordinary Americans in ordinary pursuits. The now-famous project produced 85,000 photographs, and scores of them are in this large-format paperback. Peter Davis wrote here in 1983 that the illustrations alone would make an excellent book.",1985-10-27T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ONE OF MY VERY BEST FRIENDS. By Shirley Lord. (Crown, $16.95.) Readers will have their Perry Ellis socks knocked off by Shirley Lord's steamy new novel of sex and success. Beginning in 1950 London, it tells of two teen-age ''very best friends'' - beautiful Nell and sweet Sylvie. Both are hired by a Fleet Street newspaper and fall in love with the same man. That's where the similarity between the two ends. Nell, as loathsome as she is toothsome, begins her vertiginous climb up the ladder of success by abandoning an illegitimate child, escaping to Canada with the man Sylvie loves and involving herself with a Mafia boss while stealing cosmetic secrets from the chemist she lured from Sylvie's Aunt Gert. Her big break comes when she marries a much older millionaire who sets her up in the beauty business and enrolls her in a private course in the art of public manipulation taught by a lesbian Hungarian harpie. Nell, who has become known as ''the Godmother'' of beauty and independence to millions of women worldwide, has one stab of human feeling: she falls for her very married son-in-law. Sylvie, meanwhile, has married a top composer, but her happiness is shattered by Nell's compulsive evil. Sylvie survives and becomes a crack gossip columnist. Although the action takes place in some of the world's very best places, it winds down in Palm Beach, Fla., in 1975, with both women getting their just destinies, and the cast of characters from their pasts all present and accounted for.",1985-10-27T05:00:00+0000

Klaus Barbie, the Nazi ''butcher of Lyons'' who fled to Bolivia in 1951, is in a French prison awaiting trial for war crimes. This well-researched book by the French journalist Ladislas de Hoyos is crammed with information from interviews and government records and focuses on the maneuvers that got Mr. Barbie expelled from Bolivia and sent back to France. In February 1983, after years of diplomatic wrangling, Mr. Barbie was led into Lyons, where as head of the Gestapo he tortured and murdered Jews, civilians and Resistance fighters. Mr. Barbie, twice condemned to death by French courts in absentia, felt safe in Bolivia when the 20-year statute of limitations on war crimes ran out. This book gives names, places and other information likely to be used by the prosecution as evidence of Mr. Barbie's crimes. But Mr. de Hoyos also tries to determine why it took France 40 years to get Mr. Barbie back. Mr. de Hoyos writes that the French Government was afraid of what Mr. Barbie might say in his defense if he were prosecuted. Mr. Barbie is notorious in France as the killer of the Resistance leader Jean Moulin, but has claimed since the Allies liberated Lyons that Moulin was betrayed by Rene Hardy, another member of the Resistance. In 1948 Mr. Barbie was interrogated by French investigators, but only in connection with the trial of Hardy, who was exonerated. Mr. Barbie's testimony, which is reprinted in the book's appendix, would, if proved accurate, be an intense embarrassment to the French.",1985-10-27T05:00:00+0000

Chambliss, Figure in '63 Bombing","Robert Edward Chambliss, the Alabama Ku Klux Klansman who was convicted of murder in the 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church that killed four black girls, died yesterday in a hospital in Birmingham. He was 81 years old and had a history of heart problems. The dynamite bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning, Sept. 15, 1963, was one of the most infamous incidents of racial violence in that era of the civil rights movement. Mr. Chambliss, a truck driver for an auto parts company, joined the Klan in 1924 at the age of 20 and was known as ''Dynamite Bob.'' In 1977 he was convicted of the murder of only one of the four girls. She was Denise McNair, the 11-year-old daughter of Christopher McNair, then a Birmingham photographer and today a member of the State Legislature. The other victims were Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins, all 14. At least four other Klansmen were identified as suspects in the bombing, but none were ever indicted for the crime. John Hale, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, said Mr. Chambliss was taken Monday to the Lloyd Nolan Hospital and Health Center from the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Ala., where he was serving a life sentence.

He was 70 years old. Mr. Wolfe's best known work was ''The Great Prince Died,'' a novel published in 1959, based on the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico in 1940. The novel centers on Victor Rostov, a Russian revolutionary who was living in exile in Coyoacan, a suburb of Mexico City, and includes his feelings of guilt and the impending murder. Explaining the novel, Mr. Wolfe wrote: ''This work cannot be called history. It is, rather, a fiction based upon, derived from - dogged by, if you will - history.'' In 1955, Mr. Wolfe adapted his novel for an NBC Playhouse drama called ''Assassin.'' After ''The Great Prince Died'' went out of print, Mr. Wolfe revised the novel and retitled it ''Trotsky Dead.'' Among Mr. Wolfe's other books are ''The Late Risers,'' ''In Deep,'' ''Limbo,'' ''The Magic of Their Singing,'' ''Lies'' and ''Logan's Gone.'' With Mezz Mezzerow, he was co-author of ''Really the Blues,'' the life story of Mr. Mezzerow, the jazz musician who became a drug addict. Mr. Wolfe was born in New Haven and received a degree in psychology from Yale University in 1935. Two years later, he became Trotsky's secretary.

Lindsay, died of a heart attack Monday at Brookhaven (L.I.) Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Elmira, N.Y. Mr. O'Donnell, a former reporter, had been the most prominent government press aide in the state for nearly 30 years. He had been a top aide in 11 statewide campaigns for president, governor and senator and two New York City mayoral campaigns. Although he fervently believed that press secretaries should not upstage their political clients - ''a public-relations man should rarely be seen, and heard only indirectly,'' he said - he became as well known among politicians and reporters as many of his clients. Mr. O'Donnell, a student of history and government who knew the political history and geography of the state as few did, went considerably beyond the role of press spokesman to lay the groundwork for governmental decisions and political campaigns. He moved easily between the executive chamber in Albany and campaign headquarters in New York City. A Compiler of Statistics Every year, he compiled statistics on voter trends that were the forerunners of the data used in modern, scientific political campaigns. Mr. O'Donnell, who was born in Elmira on Oct, 9, 1914, started his 20-year newspaper career with The Elmira Advertiser in 1933 and later worked at The Elmira Star Gazette, where he rose to sports editor, The Buffalo Evening News and the Albany bureau of The Associated Press, where he eventually became bureau chief. In 1952, he was appointed press secretary to the State Comptroller, J. Raymond McGovern, but soon moved to the post of press secretary to Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. He later served as a special assistant to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and as press secretary to Gov. Malcolm Wilson. All were Republicans, but a Democrat, Gov. Hugh L. Carey, appointed Mr. O'Donnell as his communications director. Spokesman for Republicans Between governmental stints, he was the spokesman for the Republican state committee. He also served as first deputy commerce commissioner during part of the Rockefeller administration. He is survived by his wife, Alice Gaffey O'Donnell; two daughters, Ellen Williams of Brookhaven and Ann Prichard of Washington; a brother, Jerome, of Elmira, and eight grandchildren.
