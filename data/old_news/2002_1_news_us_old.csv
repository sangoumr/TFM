EchoStar planned to drop the Family channel and ESPN Classic at midnight yesterday because it did not have enough capacity. A hearing is expected on Jan. 10 when the order expires. The two companies have been negotiating over the Family channel since October, said Disney's president, Bob Iger. It was then that Disney bought the channel, called Fox Family, from the News Corporation and Saban Entertainment for $5.2 billion. But in recent talks with EchoStar, Mr. Iger said, ''We felt their intention to negotiate was not as real as expressed.'' The tussle comes at an awkward time for EchoStar, which recently said it would merge with Hughes Electronics, which is controlled by General Motors and owns DirecTV, making it the dominant American satellite operator. ''EchoStar stands firm in its belief that it has the right to discontinue broadcasting ABC Family,'' said Judianne Atencio, an EchoStar spokeswoman. Laura M. Holson (NYT)",2002-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Persky was born in Cleveland, OH March 4, 1919 and graduated from Cleveland Heights High School. He subsequently attended The University of Michigan on a football scholarship, where his interest in medicine blossomed after a hip injury ended his football career. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Michigan and pursued his medical studies at The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. Dr. Persky was a Captain in the Army Medical Corps from 1946-48. Subsequent training was in general surgery at the Beth Israel Hospital (Boston). After serving as the Damon Runyon Research Fellow at Harvard University in 1950-51, he returned to Cleveland as a faculty member of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, where he was Professor of Surgery as well as Chairman for the Division of Urology for nearly 30 years. Dr. Persky is widely considered one of the most published urologists in the United States, having authored more than 200 scientific articles; he also trained many urologists including six active university department chairpersons. He was a member of every prestigious urologic society in the world, and the Lester Persky Endowed Professorship at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine was established in his honor. Aside from his busy urology practice, he took great pride in his skill as a general practitioner of medicine and in his tennis game. He was a member fo the Cleveland Racquet Club and the Quail Creek Country Club of Naples. He was a member of the Inaugural Class of Inductees into the Cleveland Heights High School Hall of Fame. Dr. Persky ''retired'' to Florida in 1988 when he jointed the faculty of the University of South Florida College of Medicine as an Emeritus Professor of Surgery. However, his sizable monthly long-distance phone bill reflected his continued dedication and devotion to his former Cleveland patients. He was a member of the medical staff of the VA Clinic in Fort Myers at the time of his death. Dr. Persky is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Mary Elizabeth Connor, sons David (Mary) Persky of Tampla, FL and Dr. James (Cindy) Persky of Cleveland Heights, OH, daughter Katherine Persky of Manhattan, NY; five grandchildren, Zachary, Paige Abigail, Rachael and Allyson; sister Gladys Yanow of Sarasota, FL and sisterin-law Rosalyn Persky Sugarman of Shaker Heights, OH.

The new funds should sustain its operations into the second quarter of next year, the company said. The offering price was $9.85 a share, less than half the $21 a share the company commanded when it sold 10 million shares last February. The Sirius network, which includes 100 channels of digital radio programming, is to begin limited service next month and is expected to be available nationwide by the third quarter. Sirius is highly dependent on the willingness of auto companies to equip cars with digital receivers. Only a few luxury vehicles are currently equipped to receive the signals. The stock sale, managed by Lehman Brothers, removed doubts about Sirius's near-term financial condition but reminded shareholders that much more money will be needed to carry the company into 2005, when analysts expect its revenues to finally catch up with spending. The company's shares fell $1.42, or 13.1 percent, to $9.46. Coincidentally, shares of Sirius's main rival, XM Satellite Holdings, fell 8.5 percent, to $15.59, after a report in The Wall Street Journal questioned the expense and signal reliability of XM's service, which began in November.

It was opposed by the head of the tribunal in the case and by Mr. Berlusconi's opponents, who called it a ''shameless move'' to protect the defendant, Cesare Previti, who was minister of defense in Mr. Berlusconi's first government, in 1994.

The United Nations agency in charge of monitoring trade in endangered species could ban caviar exports from Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan if they failed to follow a 12-month plan devised last summer to save the plunging sturgeon population in the Caspian, the primary source of black caviar. Poaching, pollution and oil drilling have decimated the sturgeon, scientists say. The countries have been allotted quotas for this year ranging from 423 tons of sturgeon catch and 32 tons of exported caviar for Russia, to 69 tons of sturgeon and 6 tons of caviar exports for Turkmenistan. Iran, the other country on the Caspian, is allowed unlimited exports because it controls the sturgeon catch in its waters. Sophia Kishkovsky (NYT)",2002-01-05T05:00:00+0000

Memorial services for Dr. Harden will be held on Monday, January 7, at Mary Star of the Sea Catholic Church, 7727 Girard Ave., La Jolla, at 3:00P.M. Dr. Harden was a native of Rochester, NY. She began her modeling career at age 13 with Eastman Kodak Co. and B. Forman Dept. Store, later earning a scholarship to Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY where she studied fashion design. She was featured on the cover of numerous magazines including Parade, Look and Life. When she married she used her public relations flair to help her husband, Frank E. Harden, build two successful companies, Harden Furniture Co. and The Camden Wire Co. In the 1950s while working for Bausch and Lomb Optical, Ms. Harden was selected by the U.S. Government to participate in a tour of the Soviet Union to educate the USSR on ''what the women of the 50's were really like''. Her next career was on television. Her TV shows took her from Rochester to Miami where she had an early morning TV show, news spots, cooking demonstrations, interviews, exercise shows, and even did the weather. While in Miami Ms. Harden became one of the first woman stockbrokers in the state of Florida, catering to a large and mostly wealthy female client base. Dr. Harden moved to Italy in the 1960s where she lived and concentrated on her artistic talents. After 5 years she returned to the U.S., making her home in La Jolla, CA. She earned her Ph.D in art Therapy in the 1980s. Until 2001, she continued to teach art classes, most recently for the Parks and Recreation Department in Ja Jolla, encouraging new students to paint. Dr. Harden's paintings are in many outstanding private collections throughout the world. Dr. Harden was active in community activities and organizations including the San Diego Opera, The Museum of Modern Art in La Jolla, The Charter 100, ChildHelp USA, American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the Food and Wine Club.

Pony trainers ($60 at Canal Jean Company in New York and Fred Segal in Los Angeles) have been spotted on celebrities like Luke Wilson, Pamela Anderson, Rob Lowe and Ingrid Casares, the Miami club impresario. ''They're more original than Adidas,'' Ms. Casares said, ''and they remind people of their childhoods.'' Other designs enjoying a renaissance are classic low white K-Swiss sneakers ($57 at Foot Locker and www.vimsneakers.com), canvas Nylite tennis shoes by Tretorn ($35 at www.classicsportsshoes.com) and checkered Vans ($26 to $40, depending on size, at www.vans.com).

She was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, the youngest child of Emil Mlynarski, composer, violinist, co-founder 1901 and first Conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic, and later Director of the Warsaw Opera for 20 years. In her youth, she studied dance in Dresden with Mary Wigman. She was briefly married tothe pianist, Mieczyslaw Munz, who later taught at Juilliard. Her 50 year marriage to Arthur Rubinstein lasted until his death in 1982. They lived in Paris until the outbreak of WW II in 1939, when they were forced to leave, later joining the emigre artistic community in Hollywood. They became US citizens in 1946. After 1954 they reclaimed their house in Paris, and also maintained homes in New York and Spain. Our mother was known for her wonderful cooking, her memorable parties, her great charm, her elegance and beauty. She spoke seven languages, was immensely musical, sculpted, painted, and even embroidered with talent. She was a co-founder of the annual Polonaise Ball and played a major role in making it a highly successful event for the benefit of Polish Assistance, Inc. In 1983, Alfred A.

In my experience, Canadian cuisine consists mainly of doughnuts and beer. Canadians have also have developed a certain dry ginger ale. Yet, aside from Canadian bacon, the Maple Leaf has nothing to do with our neighbors to the north. The menu is that of a diner: every conceivable dish for breakfast, lunch and dinner, all at very reasonable prices. But the mood and spirit of the Maple Leaf is that of an old-fashioned Main Street U.S.A. family restaurant. If there wasn't a teriyaki wrap on the menu, you'd have no idea what decade it was. I tried a specialty sandwich -- the open sliced Romanian steak deluxe (with fries, $6.95). The manager explained that ''Romanian'' is just another name for marinated skirt steak. Regardless, this succulent sandwich is the best export from that country since Nadia Comaneci. My friend Joe ordered the grilled Cajun chicken sandwich (with bacon, mozzarella cheese, and fries, $5.55) and proclaimed it ''Tasty.'' (He did precede it with a word not fit for a family restaurant.) He also enjoyed an egg cream ($1.10). We both sampled the French onion soup ($2.95) served in a crock with melted mozzarella crusting over the sides. How else would it be served?

Adler, who traced the crack cocaine trade in his first book, ''The Land of Opportunity,'' has taken another look at American society, this time examining how manufacturing jobs move from place to place. ''Mollie's Job: A Story of Life and Work on the Global Assembly Line'' (Scribner, $27.50), starts with Mollie James, who moved to Paterson from the South in the 50's and went to work a manufacturing plant in Paterson making fluorescent light parts and heading the local union, the first woman and one of the first African-Americans to hold the position. Then it traces the job as it reverses Mollie James's journey, leaving Paterson in 1989 and heading to the South, to a factory in Mississippi, and then, under the free trade agreement between the United States and Mexico to Matamoros, Mexico. By looking not only at the job but also at the women who hold it, Mr. Adler puts a human face on global economics.

When E-ZPass was installed, it was said that the fines from toll cheaters would pay the cost of the system. In a written statement issued on Wednesday, Mr. Gross said: ''It is the prerogative of the incoming governor to request the Turnpike Authority Board of Commissioners to select a chief operating officer of the Governor's choice.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PETERKIN, KATHARINE URBAN","PETERKIN-Katharine Urban. Of Darien, CT, died at her home on January 3, 2002. She was 82. Mrs. Peterkin had been involved in local activities such as the Yellow Balloon and Tots and Teens consignment shops, the Darien/New Canaan Smith Club, the Junior League, and New York City's Foreign Policy Association. With her husband DeWitt Peterkin, Jr., who predeceased her, she was a member of the Tokeneke Beach Club, the Wee Burn Country Club, the Noroton Yacht Club and Ox Ridge Hunt Club. Before his death, Mr. Peterkin had worked for 60 years with JP Morgan, where his positions included Vice-Chairman of the Board and member of the Director's Advisory Council. Mrs. Peterkin was born in Buffalo, New York on May 17, 1919, to the late Florence Zeller Urban and George P. Urban. Her father was head of Buffalos George Urban Milling Company, as was his father and grandfather before him. The Urban family has figured very prominently in Buffalo industry and civic life for well over 150 years and continue to do so. Mrs. Peterkin's great-grandfather was a pioneer in the use of electric power and in 1899 was the first to operate a milling company with electricity generated by Niagara Falls. Mrs. Peterkin graduated from the Masters School and, in 1941, from Smith College. She then became a copywriter with the Young & Rubicam advertising agency in New York City before her marriage in 1948 to Mr. Peterkin. Besides her husband, Mrs. Peterkin is predeceased by her sisters Florence Wyper and Ada Marie Urban, as well as her son Christopher Cameron Peterkin. She is survived by her brother Henry Zeller Urban and his family, as well as her children Clare, DeWitt III, George, Kate, and Patrick, and three grandchildren, Jennifer, Stephanie and William.

us,Eaten by Boston,"William F. Weld's elegiac third novel, STILLWATER (Simon & Schuster, $23), is set in western Massachusetts in the late 1930's and is full of ''simple people, accustomed to hard physical work but without any instinct for confrontation.'' They shuffle from primarily agricultural jobs into Ripton Congregational Church to hear dour sermons instructing them of their ''bounden duty to submit to the order of things,'' or they linger at Conkey's Tavern. They have few radios and ''no idea there was a government, except in the towns.'' These are people whose imaginations rarely extend beyond the place and the moment where they are, and their blind acceptance of the hand they're dealt makes them especially susceptible to a corrupt scheme conceived in Boston, where power brokers intent on building a reservoir decide to bribe prominent individuals in the community, displace the residents and put five farming towns under water. Weld's story tells of one valley's last year through the eyes of 15-year old Jamieson Kooby. During this time Jamieson also falls in love with a girl who remembers having lived several other lives in the area, befriends a vagrant who challenges the local officials' corruption and learns from the intelligent and spirited grandmother who raises him. The plot develops as slowly as a Sunday in the valley, and there is a plaintive, lullaby quality to the prose that grows soporific in places. But Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts whose previous novels were both about contemporary politics, succeeds in creating a haunting kind of ghost story about a place stewing in its own slow history until it vanishes forever.

Complex negotiations are nothing unusual for Mr. Varnedoe -- as chief curator of the Modern's department of painting and sculpture since 1988, he has spent roughly a quarter of his life as the steward of the world's premier collection of modern art, a role in which scholarship and aesthetic decisions are always tempered by the practicalities of loans, bequests and purchases. But this acquisition is different. In October, Mr. Varnedoe announced that he was leaving the Modern.

''There are some people who think that white men are the only ones who can do things the best they can,'' he told Ernie Wolfe in an interview in ''Dateline Kenya: The Media Paintings of Joseph Bertiers.'' ''So I use that name so many people can be confused. They think I am a Frenchman, and when they come to the real man, they see a black man.'' Bertiers began by painting signboards and then moved on to events. Today, his incisive commentary can be on pop culture, like his painting about Tonya Harding's ''Tarnished Victory'' (1994) or politics, whether it's the L.A. riots, the Waco showdown or the O.J. trial. The work can be cryptic or concise, but it is always opinionated. ''Our Boy Is Free,'' a portrait of Johnnie Cochran, O.J. and Robert Shapiro, was painted before the end of the trial. Shapiro is wearing a shirt that says, ''It's Only a Painter and a Lawyer Who Can Change Black 2 White.'' Bertiers says: ''O.J.'s trial was pumped with permanent difficulties, which included racism.

Far left, five pictures of Isabel Dupr, a stylist at the American edition of Elle, whose informal but creative mix of designers' separates infallibly expresses her personality.

William championed the redevelopment of disadvantaged communities in New York City devastated by the effects of decades of rent control laws and led the battle, with his close friend Sheldon Katz, in the late 1960s and 70s to win control of the Rent Stabilization Association (RSA), where he remained on the Executive Committee of the Board, passionate about the organization's purpose and devoted to his colleagues. He co-founded the Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP), dedicated to the issues of small property owners, where he remained Chairman Emeritus, always devoted to its members and leaders. Together these two organizations represent the owners of all rent regulated apartments in New York City. He was a lifelong member of the Real Estate Board of New York, member of the Board of Directors of the Realty Advisory Board and accomplished Chairman of his family real estate investment firm.

Suggested prices are $1,300 for the IP5 and $1,700 for the IP7BT. The cameras display a thumbnail image of the first frame of each scene; touch the image and the tape fast-forwards to it. Users can also electronically enter a title for each cassette, which appears once the cassette is reinserted. The more expensive Handycam model stores still digital images on Sony's removable Memory Sticks.

The increase is the first sign of a recovery in the steel industry after prices fell to their lowest in 20 years. Usinor said it was able to raise prices because it was experiencing increasing demand. Some analysts viewed that as a sign that world economies might be recovering, although they cautioned that the surge in demand might be a result of a concerted effort by steel producers to reduce output as a way to drive up prices. Last month, the governments of about 40 countries agreed to reduce steel output over 10 years by almost 100 million tons. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2002-01-12T05:00:00+0000

The increase was almost 9 percent when adjusted for currency exchange-rate fluctuations. Carrefour, which operates 9,000 stores in Europe, Latin America and Asia, but whose biggest markets are in France and Spain, reaped the harvest of an aggressive promotion program that included an offer in December to pay consumers 10 times the price difference if they discovered a product selling for less at a competing store.

They are are inmates of the Garden State Correction Center, a minimum security facility, and the building houses a restaurant called the Mates Inn. The program began as way to train inmates to cook for juvenile inmates, but in 1978, Agnes Naughton took over and opened the restaurant to the public. Now Department of Correction employees, neighborhood residents and students and faculty from Mercer County College stop in for breakfast or lunch. Menu items might include prime rib, seafood, chicken or pork chops ($5.95 to $6.95). Lighter lunch items include a Cajun wrap with shrimp, lettuce and rice on a honey-wheat flat bread ($4.75) and a mixed fruit salad ($1.75).

us,Where's Nina?,"In the course of immortalizing countless stage performers with his animated drawings, Al Hirschfeld has become synonymous with the American theater. Even his most ardent admirers might be surprised, however, to discover just how extensively Hirschfeld has also rendered Hollywood figures during the past eight decades. Two new volumes celebrate the artist's bicoastal career. Hirschfeld's New York (Abrams, $15.95) includes an affectionate tribute by Frank Rich and a biographical sketch by Clare Bell, an art historian, who tells us that Hirschfeld ''drew constantly'' as a boy. Though his first job was sculpturing architectural reliefs, he was hired as the advertising art director at Selznick Pictures in 1921, when he was only 18. Hirschfeld's breakthrough caricature for The New York Times was a woolly depiction of the Scottish vaudevillian Harry Lauder, in 1928. In his essay for Hirschfeld's Hollywood (Abrams, $15.95), David Leopold, a curator and the artist's archivist, says that Hirschfeld was as closely associated with MGM in the 1930's and 40's ''as he is with The New York Times today.'' Many of the posters and film ads have been handsomely reproduced in the graphic equivalent of Technicolor; they conjure familiar images of the Marx Brothers in ''A Day at the Races'' or Judy and Mickey in ''Strike Up the Band.'' In his humorous, loving foreword, Larry Gelbart refers to Hirschfeld as both a ''sit-down comic'' and ''the undisputed Chairman of the Drawing Board'' -- apt designations for a supremely witty artist who wields a wry pen.

Ten minutes off the thruway, the abruptly thriving area wasn't long removed from its earlier life as farm country; most of the old sagging barns were bought up and knocked down to make way for new construction, but a few of the better-preserved ones were left on the vistas to go about the picturesque business of their own slow decline. They stand there today, swaybacked, holes punched in their steep roofs by years of snowfall; and the regional sales division has shut down. Roger Howe was offered a job there, a job that effectively represented the promotion which had not been forthcoming in his four years at the office in Westchester. He and his wife, Kay, with a small relocation allowance from the company and what remained of her inheritance from her father, moved upstate in the fall of 1970, when their son Richard was three years old, and Kay, though she didn't know it at the time, was pregnant with Molly.

The commentary was of surprisingly low quality on the whole, but I made no effort in my book to account systematically for this surprising fact. Second, a review I did for the New York Times of public intellectual Gertrude Himmelfarb's book on the crisis (as she sees it) of contemporary American society provoked a surprising number of comments, many positive. It had struck a chord and led my longtime editor at Harvard University Press, Michael Aronson, to suggest that I attempt a fuller analysis of the deficiencies, as they seemed to me, in the treatment of political and social questions by &quot;public intellectuals&quot;&#151;intellectuals who opine to an educated public on questions of or inflected by a political or ideological concern.

He worried about his comportment at social events, particularly in the presence of the great George Washington. He worried about Washington himself, fearful that the new president would allow corrupt friends and advisers to surround him with monarchical pomp and splendor. He worried about the political implications of almost everything; French lace, fancy carriages, and formal ceremonies all reeked of monarchical corruption, threatening the foundations of the new republic.

It is set in a remote plot (or was when it was built). The oldest churches were made of wood only when a congregation could not afford brick or stone. The building is not always recognizable as a church; it could be a schoolhouse or town hall. It may be one of several denominations -- the state was always more religiously diverse than New England.

Mr. Gianninoto was the comptroller and Ms. Lane was a data processing supervisor with the First Interregional Equity Corporation., which is defunct. Federal prosecutors said the company sold phony leases for office equipment. Both defendants received leniency, their lawyers said, because of their cooperation, which led to the convictions last year of three members of the Goettlich family, who controlled the company.

The system has been plagued by crashes, delays, emergency track replacements, shortage of drivers and aging of rolling stock and equipment, and the collapse in service has become the principal complaint of Britain's voters. The spending figure is 15 percent higher than a provisional figure given last year, and the government hopes for matching private investment to meet the estimated $100 billion that the modernization program is expected to cost. The Rail Passengers Council said the plan offered only a ''glimmer of hope'' and said the industry remains dangerously underfinanced. Warren Hoge (NYT)",2002-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Assorted hot chocolates head the list: Mexican frothed with spices and chilies, Cuban with coffee and whipped cream, Argentine with dulce de leche. The chef, Orlando Len, left, gives a nod to his native Colombia in Agua de Panela, made with a dark, molasseslike brown sugar paste called panela dissolved in hot water with cinnamon, cloves and ginger, and topped with whipped cream. Latin Apple, a mixture of warm apple cider and dulce de leche, is crowned with whipped cream drizzled with more dulce de leche. For an easy home version, just heat cider in a saucepan and add dulce de leche to taste. Mosaico Moo is simply milk combined with a little honey and almond syrup and steamed, also easy to make if you have a milk frother. The drinks are $2.25 for 10 ounces, $2.50 for 12 ounces and $3 for 16 ounces, and each comes with a warm Colombian cheese biscuit.

us,World Briefing | Europe: Germany: Muslim Animal Slaughter Approved,"The country's highest court overturned a ban on the traditional Muslim slaughter of animals by slitting their throats and letting them bleed to death, ruling that Muslim butchers do not have to lessen the animals' pain. The Constitutional Court said the ban, imposed by a lower court in 1995, impermissibly interfered with professional freedom as it effectively barred Muslims from working as butchers. Animal protection laws prohibit the killing of animals without anesthetic but allow exceptions for religious reasons. Overturning the ban will make it easier for German Muslims to observe the Id al-Adha holiday next month, when families sacrifice animals, Muslim officials said.

The S.E.C.'s complaint accused BellSouth of paying $60,000 to the wife of a congressman who was chairman of a legislative committee with oversight of Nicaragua's telecommunications industry. That committee proposed repeal of foreign ownership restrictions, later approved, that allowed BellSouth to take control of its Nicaraguan subsidiary in June 2000. The S.E.C. also contended that employees of BellSouth's unit in Venezuela made about $10.8 million in payments to offshore companies from 1997 to 2000 and improperly recorded the disbursements based on fictitious invoices. The S.E.C. said BellSouth was unable to identify the circumstances of the payments and the identity of their ultimate recipients.

RIVERA of the Bronx has introduced a bill that would allow all immigrants who graduate from a New York high school, or earn an equivalent degree in the state, to pay in-state tuition, now $1,600 a semester at a four-year CUNY college. (Students without legal immigration status -- there were more than 2,000 last year -- will now have to pay the out-of-state tuition of $3,400.) The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and other opponents have sued to stop the increase. And a group of students and faculty members started a three-day hunger strike yesterday in protest. MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN, CUNY's chancellor, said that he supported Mr. Rivera's legislation, noting that CUNY adopted the higher tuition to conform to federal law. Karen W.

A Professor of French with the Department of Modern Languages at the College of William and Mary (1946-1968), he is survived by his son Roland, two grandsons and a great-granddaughter. Sylvia, his wife of 60 years and a longtime elementary teacher in Williamsburg, died in 1992. He was born in Chateau-Renault, France and maintained his French citizenship after seventy years residence here. He attended Ecole Normale Superieure (training as a teacher's college instructor) in St. Cloud, a suburb of Paris. There he met Sylvia Lesser, an American college student from Kansas City traveling with fellow students from Columbia University Teacher's College. Around 1930, Marcel arrived in New York City having won a scholarship to study English at Columbia University on the basis of a thesis on ''Moby Dick''. Following a renewed courtship, the couple married on August 27, 1932. Marcel's first job was as Civilian Instructor of French with the US Military Academy at West Point. Roland was born in 1935, while they resided at the West Point Bachelors' Quarters. In June the family moved to France. They lived in Evreux, Normandy for three years while Marcel taught Ecole Normale. There he met lifelong friends, painter Paul Perraudin and poet Pierre Menanteau, and passed his exams for the Aggregation at the Sorbonne. After the death of his mother in 1939, Marcel returned to his former job at West Point again, leaving his wife and son in Washington, DC. He sailed across a much more dangerous Atlantic Ocean with the goal of liberating his country from Nazi occupation. On his 36th birthday in 1942 he left Halifax with a convoy of 24 ships. After a brief detainment by the British authorities, he finally met DeGaulle in London and was promoted to Captain in the Free French Army. Marcel was assigned to a military liaison position at Pointe-Noire, French Equatorial Africa. He arrived in Brazzaville in September 1942. He was ordered to Morocco and then Paris towards the end of the war, spending a short time at the front as Free French forces re-occupied their country. He remained in Paris briefly after the war, before returning to his family in the US. Marcel. Marcel took a job teaching French at William and Mary in 1946.

It was seeking to thwart an offer made earlier this month by Pierre Berg, at left, the business partner and companion of Yves Saint Laurent, himself an avid collector. Drouot became a hot property under a French monopoly that formerly required all French auctioneers to sell through its 110 shareholders, who are also its auctioneers. They hold about 2,000 auctions a year out of a busy building on the Rue Drouot. But removal of the monopoly last year opened the French market to major international competitors, notably Christie's and Sotheby's, prompting Mr. Berg to offer 122 million euros, or $108 million, to buy out the Drouot shareholders. Barclays says it seeks to be a passive but long-term investor and wants to forge a partnership with Drouot's shareholder-auctioneers. It says many of them want to continue in the business and are eager to preserve their independence. John Tagliabue (NYT)",2002-01-18T05:00:00+0000

He said he expected Micron and Hynix to sign a memorandum of understanding in the near future as a prelude to a final agreement. Micron is reported to be willing to pay only $2 billion, however, for the seven Hynix plants that produce memory chips. Hynix, burdened with liabilities of approximately $8 billion, had hoped to get considerably more from Micron, which surpassed it last year as the world's second-largest manufacturer of memory chips after Samsung Electronics. Micron's estimate of the value of the Hynix plants was in line with the $300 million that it agreed to pay for a Toshiba semiconductor plant in Virginia. Don Kirk (NYT)",2002-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Gartner Dataquest said computer vendors sold 128 million PC's worldwide last year, a 4.6 percent decline from 2000, and 44 million units in the United States, an 11.1 percent drop, because of the poor economy and a saturated market. In the fourth quarter, PC shipments fell 6.7 percent from the period in 2000, but rose 16.9 percent from the dreary third quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. Businesses continued to delay computer upgrades, but improving confidence in the economy and price cuts prompted consumers to buy more PC's than anticipated last quarter. Unit sales declined by double digits last year for every PC vendor expect Dell Computer, whose sales rose 18.3 percent, enabling it to take over the worldwide lead from Compaq Computer early in 2001.

us,'John Maynard Keynes'," Dominating the upper part of the vale of the Clwyd, in north-eastern Wales, is the ruin of Ruthin Castle. It stands on a rock 270 feet above sea level. Nestling under its walls on their northern slope is the ancient town of Ruthin. Rhudd-ddin means Red Fortress in Welsh, and it was so called because it was built from the red sandstone on which it stood. The original castle was founded by Edward I in 1281 as a royal base, part of a chain of forts built to garrison the country he had just conquered in a brutal war. The outer walls, fortified by seven great towers, enclosed an area of about a hundred acres, including the castle proper, a chapel and a well a hundred feet deep. It was at Ruthin that the Welsh patriot Owen Glendower raised the standard of revolt against Henry IV in 1400, plundering the English who had come [to the fair] with their goods, slaying many of them, sacking the town and concluding his day's work by firing it. In the Civil War the Castle was held for the King by Colonel Marcus Trevor, who surrendered it to Parliament after a two months siege on 12 April 1646. General Thomas Mytton wrote to Parliament: The reducing of the Castle of Ruthin has cost me more time and ammunition than I expected .... It was then demolished. From the Myddletons who owned it, the property came, by marriage, into the hands of the West family, which, in the mid-nineteenth century, built a strange three-storeyed, red-sandstone, castellated edifice on the edge of the old ruins. Colonel William Cornwallis West entertained the Prince of Wales there in 1899; a year later his son George (aged twenty-six) married another of his house guests on that occasion, the widowed Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston Churchill's mother (aged forty-six). The Colonel started selling off the Ruthin Castle estate in 1919. Today it is a luxury hotel. ",2002-01-20T05:00:00+0000

The school attracted altruistic mainline lawyers as faculty, including Dean L. Anthony Sutin, a Harvard graduate and Clinton administration veteran, and Thomas Blackwell, a Duke law school graduate. They were shot to death when a troubled and failing student went on a gun rampage that also took the life of Angela Denise Dales, a local resident inspired to become a lawyer.

The owners, Oliver Pihlar and Peter Kane, kept the pink awning that reads ''Yie He Health Club,'' and patrons can watch an original surveillance video of the private rooms downstairs that was edited and looped by Noah Klersfeld, an artist. The bar's designers, Girth, of Brooklyn, styled the main lounge, above, after 1950's Las Vegas, with red velvet banquettes and walnut paneling. Downstairs, they converted the sauna rooms into hangout nooks illuminated with red lights. The hot tub area now houses group seating and a D.J. booth. But the waist-high shower decorated with the image of a rapturous woman riding a swan is still there. Anthony Bernard, a 24-year-old model, who was lounging in one of the ex-saunas with two women said, ''It's very 2002 to be able to go out and feel illicit thrills without actually engaging in any.''

Tino Merli, the chief concierge at the Plaza Hotel in New York, says the number of hotel guests sending and receiving luggage by Federal Express, U.P.S. and similar services has skyrocketed. ''Just the other day, two women traveling back to Mexico shipped a tower of suitcases home,'' he said. He said that not long ago it was only the rich who shipped their luggage. But now shipping luggage is becoming more commonplace. ''We think this trend is only going to increase,'' he said. That seems a safe bet, now that under a law that went into effect Friday, the nation's airlines will have to do some form of screening for all checked baggage. Jennifer McGowan, a spokeswoman for Federal Express, said the cost of shipping bags can be easily calculated at its Web site, www.fedex.com: just plug in weight, dimensions and ZIP code. For instance: If you are leaving New York City and heading to Aspen, Colo., and you want to ship a 30-pound suitcase along with your skis, it will cost about $100 for overnight service, or just $50 for the five-day option.

Although the director is imprisoned, his victims are never the same: Peter, whom Fee loves, dies after setting himself on fire; Fee's friend Zach shoots himself; Fee himself attempts suicide, does too many drugs and has random, dispiriting sex. Chee's tone never slips into bathos -- not even when, years later, Fee moves back near his hometown with his lover to teach. Among his students is the choir director's son, Warden, who doesn't know his father's history and bears a startling resemblance to Peter. The complex plot strands come together when Warden develops a crush on Fee -- and ultimately discovers Fee's connection to his father -- forcing both of them to face an ugly past. Chee skillfully interweaves his story with scientific imagery, Korean mythology and spirituality, and Western literary allusions. If his metaphors occasionally seem more sophisticated than his teenage narrators, it's forgivable because they're generally so evocative: ''Sometimes the scattered thoughts of their deaths run like a jagged red seam of fire inside me,'' explains Fee of Peter and Zach, ''and I burn from the inside out, like a lightning-struck tree: the outside whole, the inside, that carried the lightning's charge, a coal.'' Chee frequently says volumes with just a few incendiary words. Ann Abel",2002-01-20T05:00:00+0000

He earned the medal by hiding in a water tower for days intercepting German radio transmissions during the seige of Anzio. Mr. de Saint Phalle proudly told the story of his responsibility to deliver a decoded message he received from then President Franklin Roosevelt to alert General Eisenhower of his promotion to Allied Commander. General Eisenhower exclaimed to Mr. de Saint Phalle ''Well it's about time!''. Mr. de Saint Phalle grew up in Philadelphia and graduated from the William Penn Charter School in 1936. He earned a Bachelor's Degree from Yale University in 1940. For more than 50 years, he worked as a Textile Industry Executive in Philadelphia and New York. He enjoyed golf, bridge and watching football. He often reminisced of fond childhood memories spent in France.

The values -- courage, independence, camaraderie -- are honorable. J. K. Rowling can plot as well as any thriller or television drama writer.

us,N.J. VINES/Ringoes; A Riesling With a Smidgen of Sweetness,"The Windfall Riesling from Unionville Vineyards never disappoints. The 2000 edition, like such predecessors as the 1994 and 1998, resembles a German riesling from the Mosel: light, piquant, charming. Drunk ice cold, as too many whites are, this riesling shows little. Drunk cool, the peaches-and-apricots bouquet gives way to a creamy texture and to a complex fruit salad flavor with orange zest notes. A smidgen of sugar was left in the wine during fermentation, keeping it off-dry. On Tuesdays, it may come across as an aperitif; on Fridays, it will want to wash down fish and chicken. The wine's name derives not from a stock market boon but from the Windfall Vineyard in East Amwell Township, Hunterdon County, which Unionville once leased. Like Mosel rieslings, Unionville's ($13 at the winery) has less than the 12 percent alcohol usually found in most whites: in this case, 11.5 percent, which can translate into an extra half-glass without noticeably diminishing one's alertness. Unionville also turns out a pleasing Chambourcin ($14), a red wine from a hybrid grape with a long history of success in the Northeast. Having undergone a two-week fermentation on the grape skins and then spent a year maturing in barrel, the 2000 Chambourcin begins with a sweet aroma, which gives way to a darkish, meaty, brooding wine with something of a raspberry and plum character. I'd drink it with beef stew or lamb dishes. Howard G. Goldberg",2002-01-20T05:00:00+0000

Susan was the Administrative Director of Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and the Development Director of its educational foundation, the Rampant Lion Foundation, which she and her husband David, attorney and DKE Executive Director, helped found in the 1980's. Unique in her twentyyear leadership role in a men's fraternal organization, she was the spark that continually advanced the spirit and the services of the fraternity. The 35,000 alumni and 2,500 undergraduate members of DKE will greatly miss her. Her unique package of skills included an eye for decorating, and she was President of Park Avenue Designs, her own interior design firm. An early and strong admirer of President Bush, in the 2000 elections Susan single handedly organized ''Grosse Pointers for George W. Bush,'' hosting a breakfast during the primaries and serving as the official greeter for an early Economic Club of Detroit campaign visit. She and David continued as proud members of the Republican National Finance Committee until her death. They relocated to Washington, DC from their Grosse Pointe Farms, MI. home, where they had resided for 15 years, in February 2001. She was a graduate of Dwight School for Girls in Englewood, NJ, Bennett College, and attended Finch College. An avid sailor, she directed junior sailing programs at the Shelter Island Yacht Club and Grosse Pointe Club. Susan was a sustaining member of the Junior League of Washington, DC and a member of the Grosse Pointe Junior League Gardeners. She also held memberships in the Yale Club of New York, the University Club of Washington DC, the Grosse Pointe Club, and the Detroit Club. A member of St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Washington, she had previously served on the vestry of St. Elizabeth's Church in Ridgewood, NJ, and directed its children's choir.

A number of start-up and large companies are now pursuing the idea of molecular electronics, which might come into play at the end of this decade, when traditional silicon-based microelectronics are expected to reach fundamental limits. The patent, issued to Philip J. Kuekes and R. Stanley Williams of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and James R. Heath of U.C.L.A., is titled Molecular-Wire Crossbar Interconnect for Signal Routing and Communications. No one has yet proved that molecular-scale computing is possible, but some researchers are increasingly confident that they will be able to make machines of Lilliputian size, several orders of magnitude smaller than the tiniest transistors now forecast.

The reopening would go far in restoring the subway map ever closer to its old appearance and easing subway congestion on the A, C and E lines. The E train station, almost untouched by the Sept. 11 terror attack, is beneath the northeast corner of ground zero and has remained closed mainly because the recovery work above it meant that passengers leaving the station would have nowhere to go. The station is the nearest to the trade center except the Cortlandt Street 1 and 9 station, which was heavily damaged and will be demolished. Randy Kennedy (NYT)",2002-01-25T05:00:00+0000

It's hard to remember at this remove of years how profoundly the South then was like another country within the United States. Locked into its own massive apartheid system, implacably enforced by legal and political authorities across the whole spectrum of its social life, it really had more in common with the South Africa of that day than the rest of the nation. At the same time, the South seemed a region that belonged to some older, more primal and guttural script about the human situation, tribal, stark, fatal, that was wholly outside the general American sensibility of rationality and optimism. Even so, it had fallen the lot of the South, formed by slavery and its camouflaged sequel of segregation, to serve as the crucible for the whole nation's periodic struggles of conscience over its own endemic and pervasive racial malaise. As early as Jefferson, the recognition was already gathering that the only fundamental and intractable crisis this Republic finally faced was that of racial schism&#151;that the American political adventure, conceived in such brave hope and largeness of idea, may have also held from its very inception, when the first black man in chains set his foot on the continent's shores, the seeds of its undoing. Indeed, that aboriginal crime has been with us, one way or another, ever since. And it was the South, living more directly and intimately in that crime than anywhere else, that seemed appointed the violent ceremonial ground for America's intermittent travails to purge itself of that primeval shame and guilt.

''It's sexy without being intimidating or obvious,'' Ms. Green said. ''It's a totally natural look -- although you really have to work to get it.'' Ms. Green uses Sephora Collection No. 609M ($10), a baby pink lipstick, as a base coat with a top coat of No. 01 Chantilly gloss ($12, at Sephora). Other pale pink ''twin sets'' include Stila's Kelly lipstick ($16, at Saks Fifth Avenue) and Apricot lip glaze ($24, at Saks), and Delux Beauty's Clive sheer lipstick ($18) with sparkly Denton gloss ($15, at Henri Bendel).

He was 77 years old. Husband, father and grandfather, he is held in loving memory by wife Greta, sons Jan and Per and his grandchildren Nina and Anna who are all immeasurably grateful to have shared his life. Born in Malmo, Sweden, Mr. Brandin rose above difficult childhood circumstances to enjoy a long, successful career in international reinsurance. He had a remarkable facility with mathematics and briefly considered becoming a teacher before beginning his reinsurance career in 1950 at AEquitas in Malmo, Sweden where he worked until 1954. He moved to Atlas Reinsurance Company in Stockholm where he stayed until 1959. Mr. Brandin was recruited by Casten von Otter to immigrate to Toronto, Canada as Assistant Manager of Gerling Global Reinsurance Company, and then became Manager in 1962, and Assistant General Manager in 1963. In 1964, Mr. Brandin was offered the opportunity to represent Gerling Global Reinsurance Company of Cologne for the American market and became President of the New York office in 1967. In 1969, he additionally took over as President of Gerling Global in Toronto and also became President of Gerling Global General Insurance Company in Toronto in 1970. Mr. Brandin's dynamic innovative management style was responsible for turning the companies into profitable enterprises. In the 1970s, he expanded the operation and became President of Gerling Mexico while also establishing branch offices of the New York office in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston. New Canadian offices were opened in Calgary and Vancouver. Mr. Brandin considered this period to be among the most gratifying and exciting times of his career. In 1980, Mr. Brandin took on a new challenge and started his own company, StellaRe Management Corporation, to manage two newly created reinsurance companies, Hansa Re of America and Zurich Re of New York. He had a true passion for his work and enjoyed many close business relationships. His longest working associations were with Gunter Dahling of Sleepy Hollow, New York and Ulla Sjoo of New York City. He retired in 1991. He will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, his keen intellect, and charm. His ability to contribute to the success of colleagues and family gave him the greatest happiness. A Memorial Service was held in Tarrytown, N.Y. on January 25, 2002.

It's also an invitation to a tiny, friendly cafe and creperie with flavors of France and the Middle East. Stopping there while waiting for a commuter bus on a recent morning, I tried a lemon crepe ($3.50) so light and intensely lemony, the memory lingered for days and drew me back again and again. The other crepe offerings, like cinnamon apple ($4.50) or ham, cheese and mushrooms ($6.50) have their appeal and tabouleh salad ($5.50) or a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich are better suited for lunch, but that simple lemon crepe is my new breakfast ideal. And for commuters heading for a bus or train, it's more portable than a crepe loaded down with chunks of strawberry or apple. Mike and DiDi Tuma opened the cafe in early December, encouraged by the raves their crepes drew at a festival in Montclair last year. Every Sunday from last April through September, they sold crepes at festivals, working 18- to 20-hour days. With a young daughter, they wanted a routine. Raised in Nazareth, Israel, Mr. Tuma has worked at a string of restaurants. His mother used to make crepes for him, he said, but he recognized their commercial potential on trips to Paris. ''They have crepes on the street, and people carry them along,'' he said. He spreads batter into a thin circle on a special round griddle, adds the filling and folds it into a rectangle. The sweet crepes get a dusting of powdered sugar and perhaps a drizzle of sauce. That seductive lemon flavor is nothing more than fresh lemon, squeezed over the crepe's warm, eggy surface.

us,In Memoriam,"Adorned with votive candles, flowers and handwritten prayers, many of New York City's firehouses seem like red brick chapels since Sept. 11. BROTHERHOOD (American Express/Sterling, $29.95) memorializes these improvisational offerings and gives a glimpse into the firefighters' lives after the tragedy. With more than 300 images by over 60 photographers, the collection includes a prologue by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a foreword by his fire commissioner, Thomas Von Essen. A lively introduction by Frank McCourt reflects on the civic connection we feel with firefighters, whether we see them shopping at the local deli or racing past on a fire truck. The book is organized into several thematic sections, like ''The Fallen,'' which shows snapshot displays of lost firefighters pasted up in firehouses, and ''Grief,'' a showcase of the shrines that sprouted on the city's sidewalks in their memory. In ''The Living,'' two adjacent black-and-white portraits of older firefighters, their faces stoic beneath leather helmets, convey a sense of quiet perseverance. The personalized spaces within the firehouses -- an old poster of Babe Ruth, a musty library of fire records more than a century old -- resonate as powerfully as the portraits of the firefighters themselves. But it's the book's least prominent feature that is also its most stirring: from cover to cover, in tiny, fine silver lettering, the names of the fallen form an unbroken chain across the bottom of each page.

us,'Jane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy'," Jane Addams lived a quintessentially public life; there are no mysterious lost periods in her story. Records are sparse from the six months she spent bedridden following back surgery performed by her brother-in-law Harry Haldeman&#151;probably due to her relative inactivity during this period and to her state of mind (she had reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown). But apart from this six-month period, her whereabouts and her actions are well documented. Born September 6, 1860, she was christened Laura Jane Addams; but throughout her childhood and youth, she was called Jennie by her close family members and friends. She was the eighth of nine children of John Huy and Sarah Weber Addams, and one of only four (three girls and one boy) to reach adulthood. Her mother died when she was two years old. She was cared for by her older sisters until 1868, when her father married Anna Haldeman, a widow with two children. Jane Addams entered the Rockford Female Seminary in 1877, and graduated in 1881. She was retroactively awarded a bachelor's degree in 1882, when Rockford Seminary became Rockford College and gained the right to confer that degree on students who had completed qualifying work in science.

Her sense of fun, her warmth and gentle manner belied an inner core of strength. She had a passion for sports. She actively competed during the 1930's and 1940's in New York State alpine ski racing with her mother and her identical twin sister, the late Lisa Gratwick Nagel, often the three of them placing first, second, and third. She was also a tennis player, a golfer, and an avid ice dancer. In addition to her parents, husband and twin sister, Mrs. Knapp was predeceased by her brother Stephen Gratwick.

Intel reduced prices as much as 18 percent for some of its desktop Pentium 4 chips. The 1.6 gigahertz Pentium 4 was cut to $133 from $163 for orders of at least 1,000 units. Advanced Micro Devices, which also introduced a 1.3 gigahertz microprocessor for mobile computers yesterday, cut prices on several products. The price of the Athlon XP 1900 dropped to $231 from $269, a decrease of 14 percent; and the Athlon XP 1600, is now priced at $130, which is 19 percent below its previous price. Last year, Advanced Micro hoped that price cuts would help it take 50 percent of the United States retail laptop market, but fell short of that goal.

Duck is, in fact, valued for its rich, dark flesh; when prepared well, it's more flavorful than chicken, with a skin that crisps in a way that chicken skin often doesn't. Sadly, home cooks shy away from duck, often because of its fatty reputation (it is, of course, a water fowl, so it needs the protection of the fat). We'll solve that problem, and show how easy it can be to quarter a whole duckling. We'll prepare duck legs by braising them (always a great technique for dark meat) and the breasts with a simple sear. We'll also make a sauce of ginger and cassis that is a perfect, tempered accompaniment. ",2002-01-30T05:00:00+0000

The 25-page report, prepared by Mr. Hewlett's investment adviser, Friedman, Fleisher & Lowe, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reviews mergers in the computer industry over the last two decades. A leading example is Compaq's purchase of the Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998, in which management's optimistic predictions were followed by falling profit and share value for the next three years. Compaq executives have said recently that the company would have been even worse off without the Digital merger. Mr. Hewlett, a Hewlett-Packard director, said the report ''clearly illustrates the extreme risk involved in the proposed H.P.-Compaq merger.'' Steve Lohr (NYT)",2002-01-31T05:00:00+0000
