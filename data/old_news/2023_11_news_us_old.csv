Steps from the original location, it has dropped the Market from the name. Enter into the bar, forest green with fanciful wallpaper, then proceed to the main dining room with rough brick and plaid on the walls, tablecloths and a mural showing regulars from the original restaurant.

us,Figure Eight Takes a Southern Approach to Chinese Cuisine,"Emmeline Zhao, an owner of Silver Apricot, where Chinese food is interpreted through a new American lens, has created her own competition. Next door to Silver Apricot she has opened this new spot, in the brick-walled premises that previously housed the beloved Pearl Oyster Bar. So far the two restaurants seem to reinforce each other, Ms. Zhao said. Weve had people come here for a drink and a snack, because Silver Apricot doesnt have a bar, and then have dinner at Silver Apricot. The Chinese American approach, intended to express something of the immigrant experience, is given a narrower frame than at Silver Apricot, with emphasis on the Southern Atlantic region where Ms. Zhao, a North Carolina native, was raised. So youll find turnip tots with lap cheong mayo and shrimp ketchup; shrimp cocktail with Chinese horseradish; Hong Shao collard greens with pork belly and Thai chile; grilled branzino; soy-poached chicken with collard greens and crispy hoppin John; and hot fried skate with chile crisp, buttermilk ranch dressing and sesame biscuits. Like its sibling, the tables are not set with chopsticks but they can be requested. The executive chef, Calvin Hwang, who grew up in New Jersey, worked at Crown Shy and Saga. The pastry chef, Janice Sung, was at Saga and One White Street; among her creations is a banana custard pie seasoned with Chinese five-spice. The restaurant has three areas. At the entrance is a 12-seat bar with a standing rail and a jazzy dragon splashed across the wall. The main dining room is done mostly in blue and white in homage, Ms. Zhao said, to Pearl Oyster Bars seafood. And theres an intimate semiprivate room.",2023-11-21T19:56:18+0000

The total cost for four people on three flights was an affordable $939.75, including a $99.99 Discount Den membership on Frontier. (We also spent $1,269.52 on tickets at Universal.) But our first flight was delayed and eventually canceled, and Frontiers staff told us the next available flight was three or four days later  too close to our return flight to India. We were given a QR code at the Philadelphia airport to file for a refund, which we did for all three flights. But all we got was an email with a credit worth $339.92 and good for three months, plus four additional messages with a $100 voucher for each of us. Since Frontier does not operate in India, the credit and vouchers are useless. I fought Frontier through my Discover card, but lost. (Meanwhile, Universal reimbursed us in full.) Can you help?

us,A Scottish Bakery With Crme Brle Danishes,"The line for croissants forms early outside Lannan Bakery in the Edinburgh neighborhood of Stockbridge, where the self-taught baker Darcie Maher has been whipping up intricate pastries since the end of July. The name Lannan comes from a Gaelic word meaning house, and Mahers choice of baked goods is intentionally nostalgic. Staples include an apple-and-custard-filled croissant and a custard slice with pink sour cherry icing. Growing up, we made a chocolate sponge with little crunchy flaked almonds for birthdays, Maher says. Wed pour ganache over the top and I thought it was the most amazing thing to see it drip down the side. (The chocolate cake at Lannan is now made with buttermilk and rye.) Maher, who grew up in the Scottish Borders with an artist mother and a scientist father, appreciates the way baking fuses creativity and precision. It takes three days to produce all the laminated dough pastries in preparation for the bakerys Thursday through Sunday open hours. After the pain Suisse or crme brle Danishes disappear, inevitably by around 9 a.m., out come the cakes (from fig leaf sponge to quince Bundt), jambon beurres and finally a few sliced-up Roman pizzas and oatmeal raisin cookies. instagram.com/lannanbakery.",2023-11-30T14:00:32+0000
