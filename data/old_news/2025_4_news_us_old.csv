us,These Are the Buildings You Need to See in Milan,"Milan is among Italy’s largest and most influential cities: Founded in 590 B.C., it eventually became the capital of the Lombardy region. Yet for centuries, it was somewhat overlooked as a cultural hub; while Rome, Florence and Venice were widely viewed as Italy’s seats of intellectual and artistic production, Milan was seen mainly as a gray, unromantic city of industry and finance. However, during the so-called Italian economic miracle, the boom that followed World War II, Milan emerged as a design center. Large companies like Pirelli, Olivetti and Fiat — manufacturers of tires, office equipment and automobiles, respectively — began to provide patronage to designers such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, resulting in enduring examples of Italian design such as the former’s 1958 Pirelli Tower skyscraper and the latter’s 1969 Valentine typewriter. Milan’s rise to a fashion capital in the 1980s added to its prestige, and many of the architecturally significant buildings constructed since then were created for and financed by its leading brands in manufacturing, publishing and, especially, fashion. Below are 10 sights, listed in the order in which they were built, that showcase the diversity of Milan’s centuries of architecture.",2025-04-09T21:28:42+0000

Much of her appeal stems from the striking looker who plays her, Ariella Mastroianni, who wrote the script with the director, Ryan J. Sloan. Although indebted to its influences to the point of self-sabotage, the movie manages to surmount enough of its flaws — including some shaky acting and distracting awkwardness — to hold your own gaze, more or less. Like Frankie, who watches others with visceral intensity, you keep looking as you wait on events, wonder and wait some more.",2025-04-03T09:00:32+0000

I canceled the reservation exactly two minutes after purchase and went about my business, bailing water out of my basement as Hurricane Helene approached our home in the Asheville, N.C., area. We soon lost power for days, and in early October, when I got back online, I found a $560 charge on my credit card for the canceled reservation. I twice called the customer service number listed on the email but could never reach anyone, so I disputed the charge through my credit card, but lost. I have nearly given up. Can you help?

A circulating screenshot shows Fox News has pegged the number at 155, citing Sociosite, a junk website.

us,These Are the Buildings You Need to See in Milan,"Milan is among Italy’s largest and most influential cities: Founded in 590 B.C., it eventually became the capital of the Lombardy region. Yet for centuries, it was somewhat overlooked as a cultural hub; while Rome, Florence and Venice were widely viewed as Italy’s seats of intellectual and artistic production, Milan was seen mainly as a gray, unromantic city of industry and finance. However, during the so-called Italian economic miracle, the boom that followed World War II, Milan emerged as a design center. Large companies like Pirelli, Olivetti and Fiat — manufacturers of tires, office equipment and automobiles, respectively — began to provide patronage to designers such as Gio Ponti and Ettore Sottsass, resulting in enduring examples of Italian design such as the former’s 1958 Pirelli Tower skyscraper and the latter’s 1969 Valentine typewriter. Milan’s rise to a fashion capital in the 1980s added to its prestige, and many of the architecturally significant buildings constructed since then were created for and financed by its leading brands in manufacturing, publishing and, especially, fashion. Below are 10 sights, listed in the order in which they were built, that showcase the diversity of Milan’s centuries of architecture.",2025-04-09T21:28:42+0000

The on-site bodega, Windsong, is stocked with wine and provisions, including organic Italian pasta and tinned fish. There is also a community pantry with free herbs and seasonings, and the complimentary breakfast includes eggs and locally made bagels.

In the early 17th century, wealthy merchants of the Edo period hung lavishly decorated inro — cases made from wood, metal and ivory with nested boxes for medicine or tobacco — from their kimono sashes; as the accessories became more sophisticated, men stopped using them as storage containers and began wearing them as design objects instead. And as recently as the mid-19th century, the most beautiful lacquered tomobako, boxes built to carry precious items such as artworks or ceramic bowls, were reserved for aristocrats or shoguns.",2025-04-22T09:00:50+0000

At the idol bars and theaters — venues dedicated to musical acts like AKB48, which was named after the area — they wave glow sticks in colors that correspond to their favorite performers. And at the maid cafes, they pay to take pictures with young waitresses in petticoats and pinafores, many of whom hope to become stars themselves one day. Since the Japanese anime boom of the past few decades, Akihabara has been a refuge for the otaku — someone who would “go beyond the lengths of any normal person to pursue their interests,” according to the 2004 documentary film “Otaku Unite!” Kaede, 29, a member of F5ve, a girl group based on the 1990s manga series “Sailor Moon,” calls the neighborhood their “holy land.”",2025-04-22T09:01:07+0000

In the films of Yasujiro Ozu, the most famous of which are quiet domestic dramas set in Tokyo after World War II, that feeling is often manifested in what critics have come to call pillow shots: Every so often, the camera cuts away from the main action to a nearby object — a tree stirred by wind, a vase near a moonlit window, a passing train. It isn’t usually the case that a character in the movie is meant to be seeing that object at that moment, as another director might imply. Rather it’s the filmmaker who’s gently guiding our perspective away from the action, reminding us of the material world that persists outside of the story’s concerns. Ozu once spoke in an interview about deliberately leaving “empty spaces” in his movies as a means of revealing “the hidden undercurrents, the ever-changing uncertainties of life.”",2025-04-22T09:02:17+0000

The offer: an $800 credit for a future flight. (Or was it multiple future flights? This was the subject of debate among passengers.) I stepped forward, and was asked to write my email address on a piece of paper, which was passed around for the other volunteers to do the same. The gate agent was patient and polite, but didn’t provide me with any receipt. When I returned the next day for my makeup flight, he was there again, so I asked why I hadn’t received an email with the credit, as other passengers had. He didn’t know. Later, I reached out to Frontier, but the carrier made it very hard to reach a human by phone and sent me emails that didn’t really make sense. I did get a $384 payment — not a voucher — a few days after the flight, but since Frontier still owed me about $300 from a cancellation the year prior, I thought it was for that. Can you help?

Based on Shannon Pufahl’s 2019 novel, the story is set in the 1950s, in a world in which characters might act on desire but do not really speak of it directly.

us,A Paris Hotel With Rooftop Views and a Rock-Climbing Wall,"Paris’s 17th Arrondissement, near the city’s northwestern limits, is mostly residential, so it’s not typically front of mind for visitors to the French capital. But the opening of La Fondation, a 58-room hotel with interiors by the New York-based design firm Roman and Williams, might shift that mind-set. It’s part of a new 10-story complex that also includes an office space with rooftop gardens, a gym — which features a rock-climbing wall, 80-foot-long pool and multiple fitness rooms — and a spa with saunas, a hammam and treatment rooms. Hotel guests get access to all of this, along with two French restaurants — a classic bistro and a fine-dining option, both helmed by the local chef Thomas Rossi — and a rooftop bar that offers sweeping views spanning from the Sacre Coeur to the Eiffel Tower. For the hotel décor, Roman and Williams referenced the city’s late Modernist period: rooms feature color-blocked walls bordered by oak frames — a nod to Yves Saint Laurent’s 1965 Mondrian dress. In the common areas, large-scale commissions such as a wooden wall sculpture by the Croatian artisan Vedran Jakšić or the painted ceramic tiles by French artist Pierre Yves Canard, merge with the architecture. “There’s a constant interplay between refinement and rawness, fashion and function, Paris then and now,” says Robin Standefer, a co-founder of Roman and Williams.

He was on some kind of official Vatican interfaith-outreach tour, which involved paying visits to a couple of nations with tiny Catholic populations, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is, of course, a Muslim country. Fewer than a thousand Catholics lived there in 2016, with only about 300 of those being native Azeris. As for Georgia, something like 84 percent of its people belonged to a branch of the Eastern Orthodox faith.

He’s been scrapping for this showdown since before he entered politics, so you’d think that before taking on such a global powerhouse, he’d strengthen every alliance, game out every possible countermeasure and get his leadership team in peak condition. The mouthiest barroom brawler knows not to pick a fight and then turn his back, but that’s what the president is doing.
