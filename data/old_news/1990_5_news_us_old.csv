Between the stages, stands sell the greatest fast food in America, including Creole stuffed bread (smoky with Acadian andouille sausage), alligator gumbo, crayfish etouffe and oyster po' boy sandwiches. The 21st annual festival winds up this Sunday, and its last six hours, from 2 to 8 P.M. Eastern daylight time, are to be broadcast live on many public radio stations in a program distributed by WGBH in Boston. (It is not being broadcast live in the New York area.) The radio people will need a detailed itinerary, fast footwork and considerable serendipity to capture the joyful abundance of a festival that's intended to be simply too much of many good things. On the opening weekend, I found the festival to be its usual mixture of easy pleasures and tough choices. From 11:30 A.M. to 7 P.M. there are continually overlapping sets of brass-band music, zydeco, jazz, blues, rock, Caribbean music, rhythm-and-blues, Mardi Gras Indian chants, country, Cajun music, African rock, even rap - all the strands of Louisiana's popular music along with selected offshoots and influences.",1990-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Now, video technology has been combined with computers and tiny sensors that monitor muscle movements to give a far more detailed analysis of human motion. According to Gary L. Scheirman, manager of biomechanics at Peak Performance Technologies Inc. in Englewood, Colo., a new system developed by his company uses a high-speed shutter and a video camera to capture images of an athlete in action. At 2,000 frames a second, the camera is fast enough to divide the video image of a movement into hundreds of sequential pictures. The computer digitally converts these pictures into simplified stick figures (left, person lifting box) to make it easier to follow the movements of the various muscle groups. Data from electromyographic sensors attached to the body are fed into the computer and matched to the image on the screen. This provides information about whether the muscles are contracting or lengthening at precisely the right times for peak performance. The system, which costs $20,000 to $60,000, depending on its configuration, can also be used to monitor muscle performance during rehabilitation programs and to fit artificial limbs.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Arpino also withdrew from the repertory the works of Robert Joffrey, the company's founder, who died in 1988, naming Mr. Arpino executor of his ballets. By the end of the week, Mr. Arpino was negotiating with the Joffrey's representatives, and his lawyer said that the company, which is in the midst of its Los Angeles season, could continue staging the Arpino works currently on the program while the talks continued. Mr. Arpino resigned after the board of directors in New York City voted to establish a nine-member operating committee for the Joffrey, which has a deficit of $2 million. The proposal would effectively strip Mr. Arpino and the 55-member board of power. Some board members felt the streamlining was a precondition to the Joffrey's receiving assistance from its co-chairman, David H.

us,  SHADES OF WHITE,"White. It's the most basic of colors, yet the most complex. Indeed, the very word conjures up a host of contrasts. White connotes purity and cleanliness, simplicity and elegance. It also represents the harsh, crisp lines of modern architecture as well as the almost chalk-like quality of rustic rooms. ''People think of white as the absence of color,'' says Donald Kaufman, the Manhattan-based color specialist. ''It is actually the presence of the whole color spectrum.'' As a result, white is a particularly hard color to formulate. The minutest change of pigmentation can produce a whole different shade. For this reason, Kaufman has created about 15,000 different variations of white over the years. ''It's the toughest of all shades to work with,'' he says.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

The newest addition to the decadent hip ranks of Jay McInerney, Bret Easton Ellis and Tama Janowitz is Paul Russell, founder of the Hudson River Ennui School. In his first novel, ''The Salt Point,'' Mr. Russell introduces his readers to the bruised souls of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a tangled web of friends who compulsively shred the ties that bind them, willing their milieu into corruption out of sheer alienated boredom. Anatole and Lydia grew up together; both are in love with Chris, a self-exile punishing himself for an earlier three-way disaster. Enter Leigh, the enigmatic drifter with the perfect profile. It's not long before Leigh has moved into Anatole's apartment and, with his touch ''at once electric and neutral,'' wreaked his own personal brand of havoc on everyone around him. The book takes its title from that indefinable, ever-shifting spot in the Hudson where the river changes from fresh to salt water. Perhaps a similarly balanced place exists in the emotions, a place where true friends can meet as equals, but it's clearly beyond reach in the bars of Poughkeepsie; these characters seem doomed to endless moral fumbling as they despair over how nice it would be ''not to exist for a while.'' Waiting for someone or something to save them from themselves, they casually torment one another and beg mutely for deliverance from ''this impossible present tense.'' In a disturbing way, these people are actually very good at what they do, and Mr. Russell's slightly numb prose style, though occasionally heavy-handed, is perfectly suited to their hollow search for affirmation.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

The conferees talked mostly about history, but they could not avoid, and they did not want to avoid, moral judgment. Despite the passage of a decade or so, Hannah Arendt, in her account of ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' (1963), had raised a question that was still painful: Had the Jews, and especially their leaders, done enough to save themselves? Arendt had maintained that the Jewish organizations in Europe should have dissolved and burned their records. Some kept registers that the Nazi authorities used, and others were even forced to choose whom to send to the ''labor camps.'' It would have been better, so Arendt had argued, if the Jews had been left with no leaders.

us,  NONFICTION,"COVERING THE PLAGUE: AIDS and the American Media. By James Kinsella. (Rutgers University, $22.95.) The AIDS epidemic is an enormously significant social phenomenon, and the general public's recognition of the outbreak, its attitudes toward the disease's victims, its perception of the threat - and the limits of that threat -and its responses to it are important aspects of the social history. Since the news media are among the most powerful determinants of what the public knows and feels about AIDS, a balanced and thoughtful history of press coverage as the epidemic unfolded throughout the 1980's would be welcome. Sadly, this book does not provide it - surprisingly, since James Kinsella, the former editorial pages editor of The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, is a seasoned journalist. ''Covering the Plague'' recounts in useful and often compelling detail the skimpy, floundering and often misleading early coverage of AIDS, the long periods in which major newspapers paid little attention and the reporting ''errors'' that in fact faithfully reflected the early years of medical and scientific confusion about the disease. But Mr. Kinsella is single-mindedly determined to prove that it was solely a matter of bias - that ''members of the media . . . refused to believe that the deaths of gay men and drug addicts were worth reporting,'' either because of prejudice or because they personally knew no one in those groups. Newspapers and television did not consider AIDS a big story until it posed a threat to the average American, he contends. But of course that is true; by definition, general significance is what makes an event newsworthy. ''Covering the Plague'' does record the dreadful silence from the Reagan White House and the confusion and delays in the medical community, although its observations are generally illuminated by hindsight. The early years of the epidemic are much more clearly understood now than they were then. But the book is replete with egregious overstatements, like the claim that ''no one is writing,'' even today, about preventable tragedies afflicting the poor, minorities and the homeless.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"THE EVENING NEWS. By Arthur Hailey. (Doubleday, $21.95.) Arthur Hailey's 10th novel is a literary example of an old boxing adage: if you don't have the fistic power, dazzle them with footwork. ''The Evening News'' is painstakingly researched, convolutedly plotted, peopled with poster-paint characters and written in a relentlessly breathless style. Its central characters are a television anchorman, Crawford Sloane, and his wife, Jessica, who live an opulent Ken-and-Barbie life in Larchmont, N.Y., until some nasty Shining Path terrorists come north to stage a kidnapping. The plot revolves around the efforts of the network folks to free Sloane's captive family. The settings are the New York corporate offices and newsrooms of the network and the Peruvian jungle, with flashbacks to Vietnam thrown in for good measure. There are the obligatory steamy sex scenes (one between a network correspondent and a flight attendant on the papal aircraft, no less) and a couple of plugs for Mr. Hailey's favorite Manhattan restaurants. So far, so good: at first ''The Evening News'' looks like yet another quick-paced novel written with an eye on movie or mini-series rights. But Mr. Hailey irks as he embellishes the telling of a reasonably good story that has some reasonably interesting characters. He manages to condescend to nearly all his women (the head of the network, for example, makes Medea look like Mary Poppins) and he downshifts into low stylistic gear with depressing regularity. We learn, whether we want to know it or not, how Opa Locka, Fla., and White Plains, N.Y., got their names. We also get, between quotation marks, lectures on the past, present and future of the television and print news business, including a prediction that The New York Times will soon be using full-color photographs on page 1.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,  When Three Beats to a Bar Became Magic,"What makes Johann Strauss' waltzes so irresistible? Melody? Offenbach and Emil Waldteufel composed melodies that are often as memorable as Strauss'. Harmony? Strauss' vocabulary is notably rich, sometimes implied in the melodies themselves, sometimes exhibited for its own sake in piquant, Schubertian key progressions within and between the sections of a waltz set. Yet Franz Lehar's harmony is even more sophisticated, though fewer of his waltzes are as endearing. Rhythm? They all played with those three beats to a bar. The quality that sets Strauss apart from his colleagues is rooted in his ambition to ennoble dance music, which led him to treat it with the seriousness of a symphonic poet. In the unforgettable introduction to ''The Blue Danube,'' a masterpiece of romantic tone painting, Strauss, with high tremolando strings, solo horn and divided cellos, gradually presents the primary theme, builds to a climax and descends from it while maintaining a sufficient atmosphere of expectancy to go on to the waltz proper. The evocation is comparable with the opening of Bruckner's Fourth (''Romantic'') Symphony.

Anyone who wants to know what the American theater would say if it could talk need only read ''My Life in Three Acts'' by Helen Hayes. In her memoir, written with the freelance journalist Katherine Hatch, Miss Hayes reflects on her towering life and career as the first lady of the American theater, beginning with her Broadway debut in 1909, when she was 9 years old, and continuing through her retirement from the stage in 1972 and her occasional film assignments and philanthropic work since. The predictably becoming modesty of a grande dame is offset by Miss Hayes's surprising candor, divulging a wry and accurate perception of her public image. ''People assume that I am a strong person. We all have to develop strength, backbone, to survive, but in my case that was a slow process,'' she writes in a discussion of her early years, when she had to contend with her mother's love of both the theater and alcohol. Throughout the book, she makes no secret of her animosity toward Hollywood (''It's depressing to think that such an artificial and unbalanced community exerts so much influence on our country''), which she blames for a deterioration in more than just acting standards. She can be equally outspoken on the many peers and colleagues who bring vinegar to these pages even as they added spice to her life. Lynn Fontanne ''had no class whatsoever'' before her alignment with Alfred Lunt. Clifford Odets was ''a crashing bore'' and a hypocrite. Richard Burton ''cared only for himself.'' Harold Clurman ''talked too much.'' Gloria Swanson, Katharine Cornell, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Charlie Chaplin are among the others who make brief but vivid appearances. With anecdotes, insights and advice, Miss Hayes captures the history of the American theater by merely focusing on her own story.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Entitled ''Domestic Arrangements: A Lab Report,'' the exhibition is a kind of rumination on living patterns and their architectural expression. If it looks at first like a model for a new, highly abstract kind of residential interior, it turns out instead to be more a series of separate but related experiments in which plain, industrial materials are used in new ways, to yield new kinds of furniture, new kinds of walls, new kinds of spaces. The whole thing comes off as a plea for an architecture of restraint, discipline and serenity - for an architecture that is in many ways the opposite of the opulent forms that have had so conspicuous a presence in the lavish 80's.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,  HOLY OBSESSIONS,"The so-called outsider artist is usually driven by an obsession that is inaccessible to the general population. As a result, his work communicates arcane truth, when it manages to communicate anything at all. Howard Finster is different. Since 1976, when he was inspired by a vision to ''paint sacred art,'' Mr. Finster has created thousands of paintings and sculptures that preach his version of Christian truth and salvation. His chef d'oeuvre is Paradise Garden, a biblical theme park in his hometown of Pennville, Ga., that attracts thousands of visitors every year. Mr. Finster, who is 74 years old, is often called a folk artist, but the persistence and intensity of his compulsion to save mankind from eternal damnation through art is more consistent with outsider art. Topical references to celebrities like Elvis Presley aside, his work is self-referential and egocentric. J. F. Turner, a curator at the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum, has produced in HOWARD FINSTER: Man of Visions (Knopf, $40) a book that is essentially a running monologue in which Mr. Finster, a gifted storyteller, rambles on about his life before and after art. The book's strength is not so much what Mr. Finster says (he's more entertaining as a raconteur than believable as an autobiographer) as the spirit in which he says it. Mr. Turner conveys the passion and single-mindedness of Mr. Finster's artistic zeal. However, by letting Mr. Finster sing his own song, he has produced only half a book. The more one listens to the self-proclaimed ''man of visions,'' the more one needs someone to provide a reasoned exegesis of his art. Mr. Turner does not attempt to place Mr. Finster within a broad socioreligious context informed by Southern folk traditions.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Ms. Routh, a vegetarian, also rejected the option of observing a partner's work. The course is a requirement for biology and biochemistry majors. In her suit, Ms. Routh argues that the requirement violates her First Amendment right to exercise her moral and religious beliefs. Ms. Routh's lawyer, Gary Francione, said the lawsuit is the first time a university has been sued over participation in dissection, although many high schools have been successfully sued. Mr. Francione said he hoped the case ''would finally crystalize what is a clear rule of law, that the state can never make a person engage in conduct inimical to religious and moral beliefs under these sorts of circumstances.''",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Barry Gifford's fourth novel (which David Lynch, the director of ''Blue Velvet,'' is bringing to the screen) is made up mostly of conversations in cars, Southern variety. In ''Wild at Heart,'' Sailor Ripley, fresh from two years in a North Carolina prison farm, breaks parole and hits the road for dream-bright California. Along for the ride is his girlfriend, Lula Pace Fortune. On their tail is a private investigator, Johnnie Farragut, who's trying to win the affections of Lula's disapproving mother, Marietta. Sailor is thoughtful but spacey, a sweet boy who nonetheless suffers an amoral lack of judgment. Lula, barely out of her teens, is the one to reckon with - dreamy, poetic, persevering, meditative, perspicacious, heartsore and practical to boot. Her past is disturbing, too. When the others are on stage, Barry Gifford's brief gab-driven novel offers a tangy low-life farce, spiced by eccentricities but never quite achieving full novelistic pungency. The lovelorn tracker Farragut, a bit of a writer himself, seems likable, but he's a desultory detective at best. The man never figures out enough of what's going on to deserve genuine sympathy. And Bobby Peru, the bad boy who comes to threaten Sailor and Lula's flight, has some awfully familiar elements: bigotry, misogyny, bloodlust left over from Vietnam, even steel-toed boots. Whenever Lula is at the center of events, however, the drawling sideways talk can hurt like fine fiction should hurt; she delivers surprises at once artful and humane. Not for nothing does Mr. Gifford give her the novel's title line: ''The world is really wild at heart and weird on top.''",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

After adjusting for an influx of census workers, non-farm payroll jobs declined. Because the employment figures run counter to other recent data showing the economy to be relatively strong, the betting is now likely to change on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.

Science fiction is sometimes closer to and often farther ahead of the truth than hard, cold reality. In 1990, it is difficult to remember just how new and mind-boggling were some of the concepts in Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 novel ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' Mr. Clarke was in on the early, golden-age days of science fiction, from 1930 through 1971, the period covered in his curious ''science fictional autobiography,'' ''Astounding Days.'' Each of the book's three sections is dedicated to a science fiction magazine editor (and friend) who influenced Mr. Clarke's writing and thinking. Mr. Clarke gives a chatty, anecdotal account of science fiction, his career and his famous friends through the years. Parenthetical reminiscences and asides are included with references to and quotes from the author's works. Science fiction in the early days, he writes, was neither science nor fantasy, but a world of action, adventure, romance - a realm of the imagination. If the pulp magazine covers featured lurid monsters and damsels in distress, much of the old science fiction writing presaged today's hard science. Many of the creative, speculative writings of the 1930's and 40's are little dated, even now; even the fourth dimension, Mr. Clarke writes, suddenly became quite respectable after Einstein announced his theory of relativity. In this world of curiosity and wonder, even the creators of imaginary worlds don't know in advance what the endings in real life will be. Even Arthur C. Clarke will have to wait to find out what really happens in 2001.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Though the occasion of his crisis is the need to avenge his father's murder, something far less specific is involved: a universality of dilemma and anguish; a noble soul forced to act ignobly, an honest one forced to lie. Compelled to ''play'' at the edge of an abyss, fatally intelligent, he sways between thought and action as he enacts a drama of will and its afflictions. For to will anything, the play tells us, is to bring about the unforeseen; to act is to injure, not to act is to be sterile. Creatureliness, the risk of being, the painfulness of choice, ardor and despair: no other play incorporates so much of our humanity.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Last week rumors circulated about just where some of the money might go. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the cash flow fell sharply last year at two of Mr. Trump's Atlantic City casinos, the Castle and the Plaza. The problems are expected to be compounded by competition from his own Taj Mahal, which opened in April. Last week a group of contractors complained that Mr. Trump still owed them $30 million for building the casino billed as ''the eighth wonder of the world.''

It comes as no surprise to a reader of William Bohnaker's lively and gracefully written book that he is a student of Zen. He peppers ''The Hollow Doll'' with pronouncements that resemble Zen Koans, or parables, that he clearly knows so well - alternately insightful, maddening, profound and simplistic. Mr. Bohnaker, a teacher and freelance writer, has a keen eye for the absurdities and tragedies that underlie Japan's widely publicized success. In prose that is sometimes exquisite and sometimes wickedly funny, he identifies the tensions trapped under the surface of Japan's industrial machine. His central thesis is perceptive: the Japanese do not live by a set of principles, but by a rigid collection of formulas, which allows them to behave in ways that often seem contradictory and violate Western notions of right and wrong. But like a koan, ''The Hollow Doll'' can seem too telegraphic and one-sided. At times, the picture is too bleak. Mr. Bohnaker does not discuss the rewards that bolster the Japanese system and so far appear to have kept most Japanese from rebelling - the acceptance and companionship a group provides, for example. Sometimes he presents oddities without perspective, which is like analyzing American culture after a romp through a tacky souvenir store. Finally, he does not explain why the Japanese have failed to act on their demonstrable frustrations. Despite these flaws, however, ''The Hollow Doll'' is a provocative and interesting glimpse under the veil that cloaks modern Japan.",1990-05-06T05:00:00+0000

''Give me twenty days and I could make a splendid regiment of this,'' wrote Col. William F. Bartlett, ''but man proposes and Grant disposes.'' Hurriedly raised around Worcester, Mass., in 1864, when the need for Civil War cannon fodder was still acute - though the war had lost all its luster - the 57th had more than its share of reluctant recruits, bounty jumpers and deserters, but the unit soon distinguished itself by its ability to absorb punishment in battle. Suffering under the command of the Union's worst general, the ambitious drunkard James H. Ledlie, the regiment's baptism came in one of the most terrible battles of the war, the Wilderness campaign in May 1864, in which 262 men were killed or wounded in the marshy Virginia thickets. Subsequently, the battles of Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor and Petersburg whittled the regiment down further - to the point where it could be argued that no other Union regiment in the war lost more men, killed and mortally wounded, than the 57th Massachusetts. Warren Wilkinson, an independent scholar, has done a splendid, prodigious job of research in ''Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen,'' tracking down scattered diaries and letters, combining them with official records and previously published material to produce a remarkable day-to-day account of the hell that was this Massachusetts regiment's Civil War. Sensitively evoking the moments of fear, bravado, heroism, cowardice and numb stoicism, the author has re-created for the reader the mud, the dust, the smell of gunpowder and the stench of the unburied dead. Seldom does one encounter a history of a military unit that so compellingly reproduces its experiences.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Netter's parents wanted for him. Despite his early success as an illustrator in the 1920's, they persuaded him to go to medical school. But they never could make him reject his drawing entirely. During classes, he would fill his notebooks with pictures, and these eventually won the admiration of his teachers. Soon they were asking him to illustrate their lectures and textbooks, and the freelancing eased the costs of a medical education. In 1938, now trained as a surgeon, Dr. Netter illustrated a pamphlet on the heart as an advertisement for a medication produced by the Ciba Pharmaceutical Company. The drawings were so exquisitely detailed that physicians everywhere admired them, and this response was not lost on Ciba, which signed Dr. Netter up to do additional illustrations. Ultimately, he created more than 4,000 drawings for the company and for its magazine Clinical Symposia, moving from one human organ system to another and filling several volumes. Now, in ''Atlas of Human Anatomy,'' the 83-year-old Dr. Netter has produced a comprehensive single-volume color atlas of 514 plates of human anatomy. Many are new, and scores more are revisions from earlier volumes to reflect medical advances. Modern techniques like CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging - technology that can see the body as it has never been seen before - have not been lost on Dr. Netter, and his illustrations have grown ever more revealing. Dr. Netter has always sought a balance between complexity and simplification, an objective that makes his work broadly appealing. This atlas should be useful for premedical students, health workers and anyone curious about what lies beneath the skin.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,  REFERENCE,"HUNTING HUMANS: An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers. By Michael Newton. (Loompanics Unlimited, $34.95.) Why an encyclopedia of serial killers? There is probably no satisfactory answer, and perhaps a publisher whose previous efforts include a manual of bodyguarding and a catalogue of poisons (''sold for informational purposes only'') doesn't need one. Still, for anybody with a taste for this sort of thing, Michael Newton's ''Hunting Humans'' appears to be relatively complete. The entries number 544, covering approximately 750 individuals who committed every imaginable variety of mayhem: mutilation, necrophilia, cannibalism, dismemberment, vampirism, human sacrifice. Only 20th-century serial killers are dealt with; absent are such earlier monsters as Gilles de Rais and Jack the Ripper - though the book does have two Jack the Rippers of its own, as well as a Jack the Stripper. Many of the murderers fit the stereotype of the rootless male drifter, but by no means all. At least two had been Eagle Scouts; one was a Sunday school teacher. About 8 percent are women, and they tended to stay close to home, doing away with husbands, children, boarders - almost invariably by poison. Without the contexts true-crime books provide, the entries often consist of little more than lists of killings, and a reader who proceeds from cover to cover is likely to start skipping around, searching out oddities in this already odd crowd: the man who fed the corpses to his pet alligators, the fellow who ''developed a bizarre, abiding hatred'' for the Domino's Pizza chain. Nonetheless, reading through the entries from A to Z is the best approach, since the volume's main impact is cumulative. There are so many! Serial killing is not an uncommon phenomenon that occasionally erupts into headlines with the apprehension of a Charles Manson or a Theodore Bundy. As this book makes abundantly and depressingly clear, it is something going on all the time and, apparently, with increasing frequency.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,  REFERENCE,"THE ALMANAC OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: What's New and What's Known. Edited by Richard Golob and Eric Brus. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Cloth, $59.95; Paper, $29.95.) It takes a lot of guts to try to squeeze everything the thinking person needs to know about science and technology into a 530-page book. The sheer scope of this enterprise is captured in the dizzying mix of topics advertised on the cover: AIDS, Hubble Space Telescope, Punctuated Equilibrium, Brain Grafts, Mount St. Helens, Quarks, Acid Rain, Coronary Bypass Surgery, Black Holes - and on and on. It is hard to imagine a scientific subject that has been in the news in the last decade that is not touched upon somewhere in ''The Almanac of Science and Technology.'' Yet for a book with such a high fact-per-sentence ratio, the writing is very clear. Naturally, trade-offs between breadth and depth were necessary. There is far more technology here than science, much more medicine than basic biological research. The section called Brain and Behavior, for example, concentrates on the great new gadgets and techniques - PET scanners, computerized electroencephalography, and so forth - that allow scientists to monitor the brain; it includes, as well, pages on sleep disorders, stress-caused illnesses and fetal-cell therapy. But nowhere to be found is the most basic concept of neuroscience: how a neuron works. When it comes to chemistry, the entries on quasicrystals, antirubber, caged atoms and other recently synthesized curiosities are right on the technological cutting edge. But why, in a chapter that devotes half a page to automotive catalytic converters and a page to radar-absorbing paint, is there nothing about the periodic table of the elements? The book is much broader on physics, describing not only the nuts and bolts of giant accelerators but also the intellectual milestones in the quest for a grand unification theory. Ideally, this balance between the theoretical and the technological would have been struck in every chapter. Even so, this is a very useful book. In the few weeks it has been on my desk I've referred to it several times, usually finding just what I was looking for.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"  In Today's TV Families, Who Knows Best?","Recently, on ABC's ''Growing Pains,'' Mike (Kirk Cameron) got what he thought was his big break - a walk-on part in a TV series as a nameless cop dying of gunshot wounds. Mike's sister, Carol (Tracey Gold), recognized the part for the inconsequential bit of body spasm it was and offered only the most measured of congratulations. But Dad (Alan Thicke), a psychologist who's supposed to know better, was mostly interested in having Mike get the autograph of the buxom series star. Who was the center of moral authority in this TV family moment? Certainy not Dad. Almost as recently on ''Roseanne,'' also on ABC, the eponymous heroine's adolescent daughter, Darlene, wrote a poem good enough for her to read aloud before a nighttime parent assembly. But Darlene balked, saying she wasn't going to go because she didn't want to look like a nerd. Conflict ensued between her and Roseanne (Roseanne Barr), who herself had written a notebook full of poetry as an adolescent. Roseanne prevailed. Darlene read. Both these instances illustrate where the center of authority lies in two different families; though opposite, each is becoming predictable on nighttime TV series. When the TV family in question is working class, or minority, the heavy-duty moral considerations, when they need to be made, are typically made by the parents.

In this second volume of his autobiography, Karl Shapiro describes his years as a ''career poet'' - poetry consultant at the Library of Congress, editor of Poetry, professor of English and creative writing - while ruefully lamenting the idea that poetry should ever have become a career at all. Some of the most engaging parts of ''Reports of My Death,'' in fact, are those that take an ironic look at the professionalism that has afflicted poets since World War II, a phenomenon Mr. Shapiro attributes to the proliferation of grants and creative writing programs and the competition for worldly success. He also has some comments about the deleterious effect of the freedom-mad 1960's on the practice of poetry: ''Poetry plunged out of the classics, out of the modern masters, out of all standards, and plopped into the playpen.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Shapiro's account of his life, related in the third person, is disappointingly flat: his descriptions of people and events are oddly flavorless, and his labored analyses of his own states of mind fail to illuminate much. Mr. Shapiro also makes far too many disclaimers of interest in fame, money, prizes (''He was constantly turning down invitations which others would kill for'') or the adoration of various beautiful and brilliant women (''He was too innocent to know that his going to bed with them was part of their program''). Only when he is considering the present state of poetry or describing his loving pilgrimage to the grave of Auden does Mr. Shapiro's tone take on the urgency and elegiac quality that make his book truly sound like the autobiography of a poet.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,  The 'Historic' Era Is Coming Closer to Us,"During the stereo LP era, the term ''historical'' was traditionally used for recordings originally issued at 78 rpm, and the field was naturally dominated by the descendants of the companies that were dominant in the years before LP - above all the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA, now BMG) and the Gramophone Company (EMI/Angel). The current Polygram companies (Deutsche Grammophon, Philips and Decca/London) have a comparatively meager and parochial inheritance in that area. But now the period during which those companies came into their own, the 1950's, has receded far enough into the past to earn the adjective ''historic'' in London's new midprice, CD-only series bearing that name. (Philips uses ''legendary.'') Bargain-priced reissues of distinguished early-LP recordings are nothing new, of course. But it is a little startling to realize that the performances in this generally rewarding batch of nine single disks and one three-disk set (featuring Josef Krips, Julius Katchen, Lisa Della Casa, Clifford Curzon and others) are mostly older today than those classic Galli-Curci, Bauer, Kreisler and Bori records were when they began appearing as historical reissues in the 1950's.

us,  REFERENCE,"''E'' IS FOR ELVIS: An A-to-Z Illustrated Guide to the King of Rock and Roll. By Caroline Latham and Jeannie Sakol. (NAL, $19.95.) ''E'' is also for enormous: Elvis Presley, a man of enormous talent and enormous excess, has inspired books of enormous ambition (Greil Marcus's ''Mystery Train''), enormous contempt (Albert Goldman's ''Elvis'') and enormous triviality (too many to single out just one). '' 'E' Is For Elvis'' is among the most trivial of all, yet it's not without a certain goony charm. The book is organized as an alphabetical listing of notable people, events and items in Presley's life. Caroline Latham and Jeannie Sakol's concept of notable, however, may differ from yours or mine: ''Crazy,'' for example, is one entry under ''C.'' What's that? Why, it's ''one of the nicknames frequently used for Elvis Presley by members of his entourage.'' Oh. But wait, on the same page there's an entry for George Cukor. What's the great film director's Elvis connection? He apparently spent one day on the set of a Presley movie and is quoted as saying of the rock idol: ''He can do anything! He would be a dream to direct. His comedy timing is faultless.'' Dropping the guise of objective historians for just one minute, Ms. Latham and Ms. Sakol cannot resist adding, ''What a pity Cukor never worked with Elvis on a film.'' How true: in the Spencer Tracy role opposite Katharine Hepburn in ''Pat and Mike,'' perhaps? So it goes, from A to Z, including ''sooties'' (''the baby-talk word Elvis used for feet''). Almost inadvertently, there is a serious subtext beneath this book's stream of silliness: Presley's talent and image exerted such an influence on millions of people that, 12 years after his death, no fact or detail of his pop myth remains too unimportant to be pondered by his fans. (There's a first-rate scholarly book about this phenomenon, by the way: Neal and Janice Gregory's ''When Elvis Died.'')

Then on Friday, the other shoe fell, as the dollar plummeted against the Japanese yen. The dollar has been weak against the mark and most Europen currencies all year but strong against the yen. The move last week was triggered by a change in sentiment about interest rates in the United States. Until last week, the odds favored an increase in rates. Now the betting is for no change or maybe even a decrease. Friday's inflation report, showing a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, just reinforced the belief that interest rates might actually decline. $ Last Previous Year Week Week Ago Japanese Yen 152.70 158.25 135.85 per Dollar W.German Mark 1.6380 1.6662 1.8917 per Dollar Canadian Dollar 1.1763 1.1630 1.1878 per U.S. Dollar British Pound 1.6778 1.6630 1.6630 U.S. Dollar per British Pound Gold $368.50 $371.30 $376.25 Republic National Bank",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,  Released Harmed,"However bad the living conditions for most foreign hostages in Lebanon, Frank Herbert Reed said they were worse for him. Mr. Reed, one of two recently released American hostages, said at news conference last week that he was singled out for harsh treatment by his Shiite fundamentalist abductors and that his 43 months in captivity were punctuated by beatings that at various times left his feet, ribs and nose broken. The 57-year-old Mr. Reed, who at the time of his capture was a director of the Lebanese International School in Beirut, said the beatings were punishment for his two attempts to escape. Most of the time, he said, he was blindfolded and manacled. ''I have been lying on my back for literally three and half years chained either to a wall or a radiator,'' he said. Robert Polhill, a 55-year-old accounting professor who on April 30 became the first to be released among eight American captives held in Lebanon, said he was ''shocked to hear what Frank was saying,'' about his treatment by his abductors. Said Mr. Reed, ''Thank God they didn't kill me.''",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,  REFERENCE,"THE BFI COMPANION TO THE WESTERN. Edited by Edward Buscombe. (Atheneum, $50.) Remember the western? Edward Buscombe of the British Film Institute does, and he and a legion of contributors have produced a magnificent, lavishly packaged compendium of facts, figures, maps, thumbnail biographies and capsule reviews for the enjoyment and edification of fans of this fast disappearing cultural product. It is ironic, but perhaps fitting, that a book like ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' becomes possible only when its subject is dying or dead, and thus a fit specimen for cultural archeologists. It is paradoxical as well that it has been left to Britain to produce a book on what is, after all, often regarded as the essentially American genre of the essential American art form. If the western is indeed dead, it is enjoying a brisk afterlife on videotape, and Mr. Buscombe's book should become an essential companion for the armchair aficionados of classics like ''My Darling Clementine'' or ''Red River,'' as well as for enthusiasts of such genre benders as ''One-Eyed Jacks'' and ''The Missouri Breaks.'' The first third or so of this volume is devoted to a ''Culture and History'' dictionary, wherein we find entries ranging from ''Abilene'' to ''Zapata'' and learn things like ''three dentists have made a notable contribution to the Western''; that wooden Indians in films were often the ''occasion of a joke''; that the Sharps rifle was the favorite gun of buffalo hunters; and that John (Liver-Eating) Johnson was ''reputed to have killed over two hundred Crow'' Indians, although it is not known whether he ate their livers. Many of these entries are disappointing, low on facts and high on all-too-obvious academic observations about metaphors, themes and the like. The rest of the book is divided among a selective (as opposed to exhaustive) collection of film summaries, a section of biographical sketches of actors and directors and an annotated list of television westerns. Although the entries in these sections, too, are uneven, most of the significant films and film makers are cited. And Mr. Buscombe has included an additional treat: 22 color plates reproducing the work of celebrated painters of western scenes like Thomas Cole and Frederic Zimmerman.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000
us,  REFERENCE,"WICKED WORDS: A Treasury of Curses, Insults, Put-Downs, and Other Formerly Unprintable Terms From Anglo-Saxon Times to the Present. By Hugh Rawson. (Crown, $24.95.) This compendium of epithets, pejoratives, blasphemies and obscenities manages to be informal in its style without succumbing to idiosyncrasy or leering. It also manages to be scholarly without being didactic or dry - always a hazard for those who want to achieve respectability and objectivity about any vulgar subject. The tone here is urbane, amused; and the result is that one ends up reading ''Wicked Words'' as much for enjoyment as for information. The nine or 10 major expletives receive essay-length treatment, including combinative forms and phrases, etymological facts and speculations. For example, we learn that the commonest obscenity meaning ''vulva'' - ''the most heavily tabooed of all English words,'' according to Mr. Rawson - may well be derived from the same root that appears in ''gynecologist,'' and that many Anglo-Saxon words became taboo only after the Norman conquest. Mr. Rawson, in his introduction and in the entries themselves, writes with a nice, funny, Latinate turn of phrase - ''Shakespeare also seems to have been using lay down with more than pure recumbency in mind.'' And under the word ''hot:'' ''That passion elevates the temperature has long been known.'' It may be a little confusing to list minor geographical insults - like ''Bedlam,'' ''Buncombe County, North Carolina,'' and ''Shanghai'' - under ''Peoria,'' but generally the book is clear and well organized, and many entries end with enlightening cross-references and excellent bibliographical material. As it should be in any such collection, the implicit feeling here is wonder at and delight in that most complex, expressive and spontaneous work of art, language.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

''One is political here just by being human,'' an Indian businessman says in Richard Stengel's portrayal of a midsummer's day in the life of an Afrikaner, an Indian and a black South African who live in the small Transvaal town of Brits. Unfortunately, both the human and the political elements are curiously muted in a book that seems to have borrowed its style from documentary television: everything that falls within the camera's focus is minutely examined to the accompaniment of a dispassionate and disembodied voice-over narration. Mr. Stengel, in his first book, has selected his facts with little regard to what might interest or inform his audience. The number of taxis owned by a particular taxi company, the names of each factory in the town, routes taken to and from work, every gesture made by a shoe salesman or customer are carefully and solemnly noted to stultifying effect. We come to know exactly what these characters do, but remarkably little about who they are. Yet the book has its rewards, particularly when the principal figures are allowed to speak. Referring to the homelands, the black man says, ''In South Africa . . . the white man has names for places where there are no places.'' The Afrikaner veterinarian, whose specialty is artificial insemination, waxes eloquent on the type of cow known as the Africander: ''Our cattle are less calm, less docile than European cattle. The Africander likes freedom.'' The effect is chilling when he speaks of the human population in similar eugenic terms. These are a few of the book's occasional patches of light, but for the most part, ''January Sun'' fails to illuminate.",1990-05-13T05:00:00+0000

In Dori Sanders' striking first novel, Clover, a 10-year-old black girl from a small town in South Carolina, chronicles her bewildering but gradually deepening relationship with her white stepmother following her father's tragic death only hours after the marriage. Clover's tumbling, unpredictable first-person narrative mixes standard grammar with black dialect, precocious insights with meandering prattle and memories of the past with a present in which her father still has a ghostlike presence. The story is sprinkled with a hilarious, highly specific commentary on food, which is both Clover's favorite way of describing her world and Ms. Sanders' shrewd means of illuminating the subtleties of racial conflict. Sara Kate, Clover's stepmother, is a ''real smart'' textile designer, but she doesn't have any more sense than to boil turnip greens ''flat-out in water, without a speck of grease'' and then dot them with cubes of Jell-O. Her new neighbors find her habits peculiar, but their customs are equally strange to Sara Kate. In one striking scene, she even sneaks into the cemetery to snatch away the mayonnaise jars full of plastic flowers from K-Mart with which her new family and friends have decorated her husband's grave. The author, a banquet manager who still spends the growing season on a farm in South Carolina, has staked out an impressive new territory here, replete with peach farmers, textile workers, drunks and crazy people, with the newly middle class as well as the terminally poor. As a specimen of the new realism in regional fiction, ''Clover'' is very much the genuine item.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

Like other researchers in this growing field, Dr. Kavey said last week that too many Americans do not get enough sleep and that the situation isn't getting any better. For one thing, sleeping a lot does not improve one's image. ''In our society,'' Dr. Kavey said, ''it's considered dynamic, a feather in one's cap, to say you only need five and a half hours' sleep. If you say you've got to get eight and a half hours, people look at you askance, as though you lack drive and ambition.'' Dr. Kavey does not mean to joke around - he said at least 40 percent of the Columbia-Presbyterian center's patients suffer from ''some sort of extreme sleep deprivation'' - but in the case of ordinary harried people, he can see how it's hard to put things off just in order to go to bed earlier.

us,  Everything for N.Y.U.,"At the graduation ceremonies last week at New York University, it was the school that received the biggest present: $20 million from the estate of Paulette Goddard. Students cheered at President John Brademas's announcement of the bequest, the largest ever for N.Y.U. Ms. Goddard, who died April 23 at the age of 78, left everything to the university. She was wealthy in part from her films, which reached from Charlie Chaplin's ''Modern Times'' in 1936 to the Italian ''Time of Indifference'' in 1964, and she had more yet from her marriages to Mr. Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque. Ms. Goddard did not go to N.Y.U., and she lived mostly in Switzerland, but she gave to the school more than generously. After Mr. Remarque's death, she donated his library and his working papers for ''All Quiet on the Western Front,'' and from 1977 to 1979 she provided $3 million in scholarships for students at the Tisch School of the Arts. Ms. Goddard was also more of a New Yorker than people might think. She was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,  WINDY CITY DREAMING,"THE COAST OF CHICAGO. By Stuart Dybek. (Knopf, $17.95.) Stuart Dybek could flip a coin and win a bet that it would land on its edge. In his second collection of stories, he gambles (usually successfully) that the paradoxical borders and margins of life are the most interesting places to locate his fiction. Some of these 14 stories are big and rich, long enough for a leisurely pace and pleasant reiterations of themes and motifs without running the least risk of seeming overstuffed or repetitious. The other stories, interleaved, are extremely short, ranging from a few paragraphs to a few pages. But these brief illuminations are no less effective, and they stand alone with a deft elegance that makes them far more than amusing little palate cleansers between courses. Crossing over to the lost territories of childhood is a recurring theme in ''The Coast of Chicago.'' Memories that are intensely dreamlike, as opposed to nostalgic, seem to drive many of Mr. Dybek's characters, whose thoughts circle and hover over old Chicago neighborhoods. One of the longest and most moving stories, ''Nighthawks,'' has clearly been inspired by the eponymous Edward Hopper painting of a cafe and its middle-of-the-night denizens. Mr. Dybek names the night counterman Ray and imagines him trying to sleep during the day: ''Perhaps it's something other than insomnia, to lie listening to children yelling as if they've re-created light; to try to dream, but succeed only in remembering.'' Laden but not burdened with significant imagery, this story exemplifies Mr. Dybek's persistence in examining the edge between wakefulness and dreaming, where memories lie coiled.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

When the Germans swept through the Baltic states in the summer of 1941, they left behind scores of ghettos, each with its own ''Elders' Council'' answerable to Gestapo overlords. When they came to the Lithuanian city of Kovno, a young Jewish lawyer, Avraham Tory, began writing a diary about the transformation of his city into his prison. The Kovno council made Mr. Tory its secretary; he started adding documents to his collection - as many Nazi decrees and council reports as he could obtain - and buried them, along with installments of his diary, underneath a ghetto workshop. The resulting book, ''Surviving the Holocaust,'' benefits from Mr. Tory's mobility as a council official; he moved freely inside the ghetto and out, meeting as often with German commandants as with members of the council and with the Jewish underground. Particularly revealing are Mr. Tory's accounts of daily battles between the council and Jewish collaborationists over how far to go when enforcing Nazi orders, and of the bitter doubts inside the council as to whether its chosen policy - cooperation - would avert annihilation. The most vivid passages, however, describe direct encounters with Nazis, transactions that ranged from the psychotic to the oddly banal. The diary, which has already been used in the trials of four war criminals, has been edited by the historian Martin Gilbert, who gives much-needed background notes on Mr. Tory (who now lives in Tel Aviv), the ghetto and the harrowing dangers of preserving the manuscript during and after the war. The excellent translation from the Yiddish is by Jerzy Michalowicz.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

GILROY (''Match Point,'' Series A): ''One-acts have the same relevance that short stories have vis a vis novels, or sprint races vis a vis a long-distance run.

us,  FICTION,"MIGRANT SOULS. By Arturo Islas. (Morrow, $16.95.) In this second novel by Arturo Islas, we meet three generations of a Chicano family as they sink roots in the fictitious Texas border town of Del Sapo. The Angel family - which also figured in Mr. Islas' first novel, ''The Rain God'' - wrestles with problems of identity and values: Are they Mexicans or are they Americans of Mexican heritage? Descendants of conquistadors or Indians? Modern free-thinking Roman Catholics or followers of the traditional church? Even the most self-assured members of the clan seem cast adrift; historically, they have been ''migrant, not immigrant, souls. They simply and naturally went from one bloody side of the river to the other.'' With such marked dichotomies and a cast of complex characters, Mr. Islas has all the raw materials for an affecting saga, but ''Migrant Souls'' fails to deliver. The characters choose to preach instead of interact, and they rarely break out of their typecasting. Ofelia, the eldest of three sisters, is always cloyingly obedient; her sister Serena is the eternal peacemaker; their cousin Miguel Chico, an alcoholic homosexual writer, is forever brooding. The third sister, Josie, is outwardly defiant; she bucks tradition and marries a half-Mexican soldier, Harold Newman, who takes her away to California. Ten years race by: Josie sleeps with Harold's best friend, who is probably the father of her second daughter; Harold unexpectedly deserts the family; and a divorced Josie returns to Texas. Unfortunately, we never learn how Josie feels about all this because the tragic turns in her life are related through expository passages or through artificially staged dialogue. And, since we don't feel sufficiently connected to the characters, their suffering fails to move us. When Mr. Islas simply steps back and lets his characters be - as in a scene in which Josie's father smuggles a Mexican turkey across the border - his writing can be fresh and humorous. Unfortunately, ''Migrant Souls'' contains too few passages like this one.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

Meanwhile, Dave Winfield did not exactly belong to anybody, at least until an arbitrator could decide how much permission was required for the trade and how much was given. But negotiations produced a deal: Winfield gets a three-year contract extension, although the Angels may cancel the second two years, at an annual rate higher than his 10-year contract with the Yankees had given him. (The Yankees get a pitcher, Mike Witt.) ''This is good for Dave Winfield,'' he said before joining his new team in Milwaukee.

us,  BETWEEN HERSELF AND HERSELF,"PRACTICALITIES: Marguerite Duras Speaks to Jerome Beaujour. By Marguerite Duras. (Grove Weidenfeld, $15.95.) Marguerite Duras is probably best known in this country for her autobiographical novel ''The Lover'' and her script for Alain Resnais's film ''Hiroshima Mon Amour.'' Readers will recognize the fragmented, elliptical style of these works in ''Practicalities,'' a collection of transcribed conversations with her friend Jerome Beaujour. Pruned and polished after the fact by Ms. Duras, these 48 brief pieces contain little in the way of casual chat; the author calls them ''return journeys between you and me, and between myself and myself.'' Like her prose outings, they package considerable pain and self-revelation in a controlled, almost cool voice. Broadly speaking, the subject matter is autobiographical, following Ms. Duras's belief that ''you can talk about your life your whole life long.'' She describes an early sexual encounter on a train, her alcoholism, a love affair with a man 35 years her junior and her unchanging ''uniform'' of a ''black cardigan, straight skirt, polo-neck sweater and short boots in winter.'' These notations of her life's ''practicalities'' often rise to a bleak poetry. She is also amusingly tart on the subject of other writers: Sartre, for example, is ''the Solzhenitsyn of a country without a Gulag.'' When she starts ruminating, though, the book sometimes founders under its cargo of epigrammatic goods - phrase upon fluent phrase, all of them seemingly assembled from a kind of philosophical Lego set whose main elements are death, madness, memory and sex. Granted, these same elements form the backbone of Ms. Duras's best fiction. But there, under the pressure of narrative, they combine in a mysterious and powerful fusion. In conversation, they remain diffuse abstractions - a brilliant writer's table talk, forgotten halfway through dessert.",1990-05-20T05:00:00+0000

If you want to join the flow, and sample a weave of rich conversation that literally goes back to such tough customers as Parnell and Michael Collins, the Bailey on Duke Street never seems to fail, except when the singing breaks out. Better for sipping in solitude, though, is Doheny & Nesbitt's on Lower Baggot Street, a marvelously dark place of cut glass, mahogany, blue smoke and brass fixtures, where the customers tend more to live and let live, with a brief nod or not, and where you are free to watch your pint settle like the cares of tomorrow, no questions asked. The best perch of all to sip some Jameson's, for my money, has been the front parlor at the Shelbourne Hotel during afternoon tea and scones.

Csonka has no particular background for it, aside from listening to his father and uncles (who would lapse into Hungarian when the shop talk sped up), but says that as a former general manager of a United States Football League team, he knows how management thinks. The former Dolphins and Giants fullback also has a plan for new free-agency rules. What he needs is signatures from 751 of the 1,200 players he mailed packets to. Then, he says, he needs 90 days to negotiate. ''Just sign the card and I'll have a go at it,'' he said. ''If not, I'll get out of the way.''",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Business executives, members of Congress, academics and other experts on American industrial policy said in the article that such financial engineering often reflects short-term thinking and is sapping American competitiveness. G.E. officials defended the plan to buy back $10 billion of its stock over the next five years, pointing out that the company is a world leader in those fields in which it has chosen to compete and that its research and development is adequately funded.",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

The long voyage from Greece to Australia begins hopefully enough for Ilias Verginis, the title character of this first novel by a writer born in Greece who also left his native island to find a new life on the other side of the world. It is 1928, and Ilias arrives in Melbourne with a simple five-year plan: he will work hard, save money and return home to buy his own fishing boat. This is not a triumphant story, however; good-hearted though Ilias may be, he is destined for mediocrity and frustration. He never becomes fully assimilated in the new culture, even though in time he has a devoted Australian wife and three fine children. When his grocery store fails, he moves inland to work in a timber mill, and as the years pass, like it or not, he becomes part of this foreign land. Gambling and drinking take their toll, alienate him further from his wife and provoke the inevitable separation. In ''Ilias,'' Jim Sakkas reveals another side of the immigrant experience, and he does so with admirable and deceptive simplicity. At the end, Ilias is alone but not broken, for as long as there is life, there is hope. His flaw is the flaw of many other damaged souls: ''There had been too much change for him in one lifetime.''",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

If you truly, truly care to know every single detail of the Detroit Pistons' 1988-89 championship season, then Cameron Stauth's book ''The Franchise'' is for you. If, however, you're a basketball fan but only mildly interested in the Pistons, it's highly unlikely you'll make it past February in this chronological account of ''basketball's bad boys.'' The author's fatal mistake is taking the fly-on-the-wall approach to the nth degree; the unceasing accumulation of detail about the Pistons' general manager Jack McCloskey, the coach Chuck Daly and players such as Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer and Dennis Rodman soon becomes trivia instead of insightful information. It's a shame, because Mr. Stauth is a tireless reporter and a talented, graceful writer. By not widening his horizons to give the reader a more rounded picture of the state of professional basketball outside Detroit, Mr. Stauth paints himself into a well-researched but claustrophobic corner. The author's other miscalculation is mistaking moderately interesting personalities for genuinely fascinating ones. Mr. Stauth's heroes, principally Jack McCloskey, are hard-working basketball professionals with rather ordinary careers now highlighted by one championship. And one championship doesn't turn the prosaic travails of the N.B.A. grind into poetry. By the time the Pistons do get their coveted rings, ''The Franchise'' has exhausted the reader.",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

us,  NATURE'S WAY OF RECYCLING MEN,"MY LIFE AND DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A Novel in Stories. By Kelly Cherry. (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, $14.95.) Kelly Cherry has managed a rare accomplishment: she has transmuted the annoying jargon common to psychological support groups into prose of outstanding lyrical strength. Who would have thought it could be done, especially in a book with the cutesy-wootsie title ''My Life and Dr. Joyce Brothers''? Well, forget the title and the classification of the book as ''a novel in stories,'' which sounds as if Ms. Cherry is trying to have things both ways. This whatchamacallit is about Nina, a woman alone trying to make sense of things in a time of shifting, befuddling mores. She is attempting to overcome her incestuous past (her brother was the victimizer) and make a happy life for herself - if not by securing a suitable man from her parade of inappropriate suitors, then at least by raising a child. In ''My Life and Dr. Joyce Brothers,'' Nina not only talks about her own past but also recapitulates the quirky biographies of her perfectly imperfect brother and of her father and mother, musicians who settled for less and whose talent and lives atrophied. Ms. Cherry is spot on with the one-liners. (''Divorce,'' Nina remarks, ''is nature's way of recycling men.'') And she also has an ability to zero in on a heartbreaking scene, like the one in which Nina comes upon her father, beset by Alzheimer's disease, as he stares at a grandfather clock: ''After a while I realize that he is not trying to tell time; he is trying to figure out why anyone would put numbers in a circle, making it difficult to add or subtract them.'' Kelly Cherry's fifth novel is so unexpectedly idiosyncratic and fresh that you forgive the occasional comment that trips over the line into whimsy. In this slim but rich work, the promise of her earlier fiction is bountifully fulfilled.",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Shulman said here in 1988, ''and if he succeeds in bringing home to that audience the logic of the imperatives imposed by a world of nuclear weapons and turbulent international politics, he will have made an important contribution to the maturation of American foreign policy.''

So it happened last weekend, at the German Open final in Berlin, that 20-year-old Graf lost to 16-year-old Monica Seles of Yugoslavia. The 6-3, 6-4 victory gave Seles her fifth tournament title in a row. More important, it ended the West German's winning streak of 66 matches, which started last June and was interrupted only for a few months earlier this year while she recovered from a thumb injury that she suffered when she tried to escape from photographers while she was cross-country skiing in Switzerland. She was uncharacteristically shaky on a few occasions after her return to the courts. After her loss to Seles, Graf said: ''I was so far away from playing my best tennis, it was difficult to get into it. If I play like that, I can't expect to win.'' But in Paris on Friday, drawing opponents for the French Open this week, Graf began to do better.

Profits from the enterprise are split equally, with the cathedral's half being applied to its own building project, which has been going for almost a century.

We loved being scared. But ''The Premature Burial,'' Roger Corman's cheap, trashy version of Poe, was more frightening than anyone had expected. When Ray Milland, buried while he was merely in a coma, woke up and started gasping for air and struggling to push the lid off his coffin, my cousin jumped in the front seat with his father, and my aunt climbed in back with me. We hadn't even done that during ''Psycho.'' It was then that my aunt demystified the film maker's art. ''Remember,'' she said in a reassuring voice, ''there are lights and cameras and makeup people and a director standing all around, just off the screen where you can't see them.''

In those days, the boys were given swimming lessons at the local Y after school and the girls were left home. Most of the girls didn't care, but I was desperate to learn to swim. I remember once sneaking off to the Y pool after school, against the wishes of my mother. But she had only to see my wet hair and smell the chlorine to guess, and I was punished. I was almost 30 years old before I mastered the crawl, back, side and breast strokes and the correct breathing technique that permitted me to do lap after lap in the pool.

But there was net selling of gold in North America and Europe. After the supression of the democracy movement in China, gold purchases soared in Hong Kong and rose 57.9 percent for the year. In Brazil, gold buying was sparked by the decline of the country's economy and currency, pushing net purchases up 136.2 percent. These increases, along with a rise in Saudia Arabia after the Iran-Iraq war, more than offset sharp declines of 29.3 percent in Japan and 8.3 percent in Taiwan. In Japan, some gold buying may have shifted to London to avoid the new 3 percent consumption tax. In Taiwan, the stock market and new investment opportunites the Government encouraged abroad offered nice alternatives.

us,  GETTING OFF THE STAGE,"ACTING IN FILM: An Actor's Take on Movie Making. By Michael Caine. (Applause Theater Books, $14.95.) Few other leading film actors in the last quarter-century have delivered as many good performances as Michael Caine; certainly no other actor, with the possible exception of Gene Hackman, has been so consistently good in otherwise unwatchable films. Thus, no one is more qualified to discuss the craft and business of film acting. Wisely, Mr. Caine does not talk about the art of acting - he assumes that even a stage actor must be remade for film. ''Acting in Film,'' the edited transcript of a BBC program, is largely a book on what stage-trained actors need to unlearn. ''On stage, the basic premise is action; you have to sell your attitudes to the audience. In movies, the microphone can always hear you. . . . In movies, it is reaction that gives every moment its potency.'' Mr. Caine skewers the stage snob's disdain toward film acting. ''Film acting is about danger. . . . If you rehearse a risk, it is no longer a risk.'' In fact, he occasionally reverses the old argument that a film performance is largely the result of such artificial elements as editing and amplification. ''On stage, technique can often fool an audience,'' Mr. Caine says, ''but in film, you cannot fool the camera with technique.'' However, ''Acting in Film'' is not a stage-versus-film debate. It is an insider's look at the difference between the two, of as much interest to members of the audience as to actors. Mr. Caine advises the film actor to learn to direct himself: ''Plays are performed. Movies are made.'' The English often have difficulty adjusting to film making in the United States, he says, because ''the British make talking pictures; Americans make moving pictures.'' And, finally, Mr. Caine says it pays to steal: ''If you see Vivien Leigh do something, or Marlon Brando or Robert de Niro or Meryl Streep do something that fits your character, steal it. Because what you're seeing them do, they stole.''",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000

''We've all come to see me,'' begins this strange, dense story of life entangled with death, first published in Spanish in 1982. It is the fourth anniversary of the day that a small-time rural wheeler-dealer named Poncho Fernandez accidentally blew his brains out, and the family has come to tend the grave. While the widow and her daughters busy themselves, 19-year-old Luis Alfonso remains aloof. The son has put on his father's dark suit, taken his father's old job and mistress, stuck the fatal Colt revolver in his belt and become Poncho's representative among the living. ''I could tell you what it's like to be down there with you, in your presumed death,'' he informs the grave, ''and what it's like up here with you, in my presumed life.'' In the course of Luis Alfonso's intense monologue, which has been smoothly translated by Peter G. Earle, resentment builds toward this identity that is shared so the dead might be kept alive. ''I had transformed myself into you,'' he says, ''so you could go on living.'' But what is left now of Luis Alfonso himself? ''Am I sick of being your accomplice?'' he asks the memory that inhabits him. And if so, what can he do about it? The answers come gradually, if at all, and in an Oedipal form that only invites more questions: ''I wanted to kill you, Papa, for if you're still living, Papa, it's only because I wanted and decided it that way.'' This brief example of what Mr. Earle, in his introduction, calls ''necrophiliac'' fiction, by the novelist and screenwriter Josefina Vicens (1911-88), continues a powerful strain in Mexican literature most famously represented by the work of Juan Rulfo (who sometimes collaborated with Vicens on film scripts), an odd but inventive school that has had a major influence on modern Latin American writing. In ''The False Years,'' the dislocations, the strange blending of personality, the overwhelming presence of ghosts all create a magical fictional environment, one that illuminates Luis's most tortured question: ''Do you know what it is to remain at the edge of yourself,'' he asks his father's shade, ''just looking at yourself?''",1990-05-27T05:00:00+0000
