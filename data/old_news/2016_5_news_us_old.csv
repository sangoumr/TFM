Almost invisible, except to those in the know, Velandia runs the international circuit as the preferred conservator for major-league fairs (including Frieze New York, which begins this Thursday). Im the doctor on call, Velandia says of her unique position under the fair tent. My role is primarily to help make sure, one, people have an understanding of what they are purchasing, that would be for condition reporting; and two, helping ensure that the artworks are in the best condition for display and sale. Her now-ubiquitous presence at fairs came out of a casual conversation in Paris with the former Art Basel director Sam Keller. Who does something for the exhibitors if something happens? she asked Keller, referring to works being damaged, however slightly, during the bustle of the fair. He said they had no one, and invited me to give it a try. Sixteen years later, Velandia is the go-to for Art Basel, Frieze and the Armory  with a masters degree in chemistry and conservation, shes the person you want on the scene when a vacuum-cleaner hose fondles a floor piece or a painting gets hassled during the V.I.P. bum rush.",2016-05-03T19:49:44+0000

Importantly, he treated these projects as a form of art. The flowers and the plants were his brushes and his colors, and the landscape became the canvas, says Jens Hoffmann, the deputy director of exhibitions and public programs at the Jewish Museum. And there was an added dimension of time. He became very, very sophisticated in his understanding of the way that things grow, when, under what conditions  and he could influence these conditions, too, by planting things next to one another, or he sometimes created shadows so certain plants werent exposed to light.",2016-05-04T20:49:37+0000

Having those elements come about at the beginning of my career really opened my eyes to this whole other creative world. Flemings fascination with fashion has come to saturate his aesthetic, including his videos, which have been directed by big-name photographers such as Kenneth Cappello and Yoann Lemoine (a.k.a.

But the sprawling 400-seat restaurant never opened. It was a lucky thing, Mr. Saran said. It was difficult to fill all those seats. San Francisco is dead after 9 p.m. So he is back in New York, in partnership with Roni Mazumdar, an entrepreneur in art and entertainment who owns MasalaWala restaurants with his father. Joel Corona, a former private chef in California, and Aarti Mehta are chefs de cuisine. The white brick restaurant, with a swath of white quartz bar and polished woodwork, is hung with pieces by Indian artists. Mr. Sarans food is a mix of Mexican, North African, French and Italian, all liberally exploiting the Indian spice cabinet. When you think about it, Mexico and India both have a lot of cumin in common, Mr. Saran said. Some ingredients, including pork and eggs, come from his upstate farm.

Sunshine streams into the double-height living space, where no fewer than eight sash windows look out onto a palatial Chelsea Square. Today, the celebrated chef and proprietor of what is surely the citys most cherished Italian dining room, the River Caf, is wearing a knitted dress in shocking pink (the favorite hue of her husband, the architect Richard Rogers). On the far wall, a smudgy Cy Twombly canvas hangs above a row of ceramics. The unglazed vessels look very Edmund de Waal, but in fact are the creation of Rogerss mother-in-law, Dada, who first taught her to cook. Edmund de Waal admired them when he came to dinner, says Rogers of the ceramicists handiwork, as she scales a ladder to reach a vertiginous kitchen cupboard. The whisk she procures proves essential in the days delicious agenda: the preparation of white and green asparagus served with a sparkly take on a traditional Bagna Cauda (meaning hot bath) sauce. Here, the red wine that typically makes up this centuries-old northern Italian recipe, featuring garlic and anchovies, is swapped for Prosecco (the full recipe for which is detailed below).",2016-05-10T18:14:53+0000

The group has condemned the law as a hate bill that discriminates against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, and as an unprecedented attack on its profession. No other state has passed such a law, the group said, vowing to work to get it repealed and to keep similar measures from passing around the country. The conference would have brought 3,500 to 4,000 to Nashville, said the counseling associations chief executive, Richard Yep, and generated what Nashvilles Convention and Visitors Corporation estimated as $2.5 million in direct spending and $444,609 in tax revenue for the city and state. Nashvilles mayor and tourist officials feared the city could face a backlash because of a law that it did not create or support. This is the second group to cancel a convention in Nashville because of the law, Bonna Johnson, a spokeswoman for the convention and visitors group, said in an email. She would not identify the other group. State Senator Jack Johnson, a Republican who sponsored the bill, has said counselors must refer patients they decline to treat to another therapist and must treat those seen as an immediate danger to themselves or others.

It was an opus of Whitmanesque proportion, a heroic rendering of the American landscape; every last whorl and hachure and dotted line of actual topography  not to mention the name of every last desert wash, old mine or glorified goat track  was exhaustively cataloged. This 54,000-tile mosaic was not, of course, done in the cause of aesthetics, but it nevertheless represents as gorgeous and complete a depiction of the country as any ever made.",2016-05-11T11:00:04+0000

When I consider that her life span is already more than half over, I suspect that I will eventually get another dog. When I do, Im sure I will go to a breeder again. (I wont get into the reasons for this, although there are many.) Is this ethical? Is it relevant that I have taken in strays in the past and given them a loving home for the rest of their lives? Is it relevant that I have never abandoned or failed to neuter or spay a pet? Is it relevant that, given a choice between a shelter dog and no dog, I would choose no dog at all? What if I give money to shelters for neutering stray dogs? What if I give money for education to prevent people from adopting puppies without properly training or socializing them, thus preventing those dogs from ending up in shelters? How much money must I give to justify getting a dog from a breeder? Or should breeders donate a certain amount for each puppy sold either to shelters or to education programs? Is such a trade-off ethical? Name Withheld",2016-05-11T11:00:04+0000

The bill also criminalized the unauthorized killing of the horses, which Mr. Ducey described in a statement as beautiful, majestic and a treasure to our state. The horses came under threat last year when federal officials announced their imminent capture, in part because of the risk of accident they could pose to drivers and passengers who go tubing in the river, a popular summer attraction. The new law also creates a private-public partnership to manage the herd, estimated at about 100 horses. FERNANDA SANTOS",2016-05-12T02:20:17+0000

DeLillo is well known for his attention to the music and even the visual appearance of his sentences: The words typed on the white page have a sculptural quality, he told The Paris Review in 1993. But to judge from his interview with The Los Angeles Times, this devotion to craft doesnt extend to shoptalk with writer friends. When I talk to novelists, we tend to talk about movies, he said. Its true. Its much easier to talk about. I just dont talk much about my work with other writers, and I dont talk much about their work. A few sentences.

The move comes as Republicans in a number of other states have opposed the guidance, with some seeking to join legal challenges.

The move came as opposition to Ms. Wrights earlier announcement that she would comply turned into a landslide.

us,Le Nain Brothers Prescient Work at Kimbell Art Museum,"One of the least-known sources of modern realism will be honored Sunday, May 22, in Fort Worth, where the Kimbell Art Museum is opening The Brothers Le Nain: Painters of Seventeenth-Century France. Contemporaries of Velazquez and Georges de La Tour, the brothers  Antoine, Louis and Mathieu  were prominent in Paris in the 1630s and 1640s. Often signing their efforts simply Le Nain, they elevated genre painting with dignified depictions of peasants usually seated, motionless, in landscapes or plain interiors. Odd in scale, spatial illusion and gravity of mood, these images are fittingly painted in a solid, workmanlike style and are startlingly prescient of 19th-century French artists like Courbet and Manet. Collective anonymity has always seemed appropriate to the way the Le Nain brought painting down to earth, but this rare overview of 44 paintings  including less radical religious works  also presents new scholarship regarding which brother did what.

They just havent earned her a reputation for, you know, humor. So its striking that reviewers of her latest novel, LaRose  new at No. 8 on the hardcover fiction list  have singled out what Mary Gordon, in these pages, described as this serious novels unexpected comedy. (Gordon cited a scene in which the residents of an assisted-living home tamper with a villains medicine to give him an unstoppable erection and uncontrollable diarrhea. This in a book about the shooting death of a 5-year-old boy.) In a profile for Erdrichs hometown newspaper, The Minneapolis Star Tribune, the journalist Laurie Hertzel also praised the storys comic elements. Oh, good, Erdrich said. I was looking over my notebook a while back, and I had this giant note in the middle of my pages. And it said: Problem. Big problem. There is no humor whatsoever in this manuscript. Its the hardest thing, writing humor into a book. But its also essential. I just dont feel like Ive got a book unless theres something funny in it.",2016-05-20T15:06:48+0000

As the convoy rumbled past the border gate, the road for miles ahead was lined with thousands of ecstatic Kurds, who clapped, cheered and waved the Kurdish flag. Many had tears in their eyes. Some even kissed the tanks and trucks as they passed. The soldiers, Iraqi Kurds, were on their way through Turkey to help defend Kobani, a Syrian border city, against ISIS. Their route that day traced an arc from northern Iraq through southeastern Turkey and onward into northern Syria: the historical heartland of the Kurdish people. For the bystanders who cheered them on under a hazy autumn sky, the date was deliciously symbolic. It was Turkeys Republic Day. What had long been a grim annual reminder of Turkish rule over the Kurds was transformed into rapture, as they watched Kurdish soldiers parade through three countries where they have long dreamed of founding their own republic.",2016-05-24T09:00:05+0000

The recipes were first collected by an assistant registrar at what is now the George Eastman Museum, drawn from an array of contributions by over 120 notable photographers of that era, most of whom included photographs or imagery with their submissions. As telling as they are of trends and cultural backgrounds  like Arnold Newmans dieters choice of cottage cheese salad, or Betty Hahns kolacky (an Eastern European cookie)  the dishes offer a unique snapshot of the artists personalities. Some, like Joseph Jachnas potato chip cookies  which predated Momofuku Milk Bars famous compost cookies by about 40 years  could even be considered visionary.",2016-05-24T16:48:05+0000

Me and manual labor dont really mix, Jury says, adding that his co-workers  mostly truck drivers picking up work in their off-season  didnt treat me very nice.

What appeared at the time to be unprecedented about the novel seems more mundane to us today, whereas what then came across as mundane now seems unprecedented. Joyces novel remains vital, in contrast to almost all other novels published in 1916, because he forcefully strived toward an idiosyncratic form of expression, a language intrinsic to the story he wanted to tell, about the young protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, and his formative years in Dublin, in which uniqueness was the very point and the question of what constitutes the individual was the issue posed.",2016-05-25T19:44:54+0000

As an adult, I dont subscribe to any religion. My immediate family, however, continues to be deeply religious and very much adheres to what I now believe are extreme views. They are, of course, free to worship as they please. I, however, take issue with the hypocrisy in their own lives. For example, they are strongly anti-choice, yet one had an abortion during a complicated pregnancy. They are pro-family, yet gave up an adopted child that became too difficult. They boycotted a parental wedding because the bride and groom were each previously married; participating would have blessed the sin. There is also a personal aspect for me in that they openly oppose L.G.B.T. rights, support politicians and groups that are extremely anti-gay, attend schools that require opposition to gay civil liberties in their codes of conduct and belong to anti-gay churches. Im openly gay. I have been told that I am not welcome in certain family members homes because of my lifestyle choice. ",2016-05-26T11:00:05+0000

An E.P.A. health advisory is not a regulation; it is nonbinding and nonenforceable. It does, however, require a public water system to notify its customers of the presence of the chemical and the dangers it poses. As a result, the E.P.A.s announcement had immediate effects. Within hours, public wells were shut down in Horsham, Pa., and Maricopa County, Ariz. West Virginias Bureau for Public Health ordered a do not drink advisory for the water in three communities: Parkersburg, the site of a Teflon factory that until recently was operated by DuPont; the adjacent town of Vienna; and Martinsburg, four hours east, near the Maryland border.

us,Documentary Retries Kitty Genoveses Neighbors,"A brutal crime takes place; onlookers shrug and do nothing. The stabbing death of a woman named Kitty Genovese outside her apartment building in Queens in 1964 was the archetypal instance of such a social phenomenon. Or was it? The Witness, a documentary opening on Friday, June 3, calls the familiar version of the case into question. The specter of public indifference was carved in stone by reporting in The New York Times that said dozens of witnesses ignored the victims calls for help. This film, directed by James Solomon, challenges that contention, using witness accounts, police reports and more as Bill Genovese, Kittys brother, searches for a less callous version of her death. In re-examining the case, the film becomes a study of how the news media shapes narratives that can take on a life of their own when, as in this case, they capture an attitude or opinion that was waiting to be crystallized.",2016-05-27T13:00:05+0000
