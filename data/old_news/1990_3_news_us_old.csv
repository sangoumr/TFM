us,"Reviews/Theater;   Part Love, Part Siege in a Romance","In her plays, ''Warriors From a Long Childhood'' and ''Five in the Killing Zone,'' Lavonne Mueller wrote with effortless authenticity about men in battle. In ''Violent Peace,'' the third play in her war trilogy, she writes about a man and a woman locked in a lifelong relationship that is part love, part siege. Both characters - a general's daughter and her father's adjutant - are permanently wedded to the military. They are a family within a family. Ms. Mueller writes with authority about the strictures and rituals and the emotional dress code of Army life. Her two characters are keenly observed and the dialogue has a visceral quality that overcomes occasional moments of artificiality. At the same time, the play, a production of the Women's Project (at the Apple Corps Theater), has unresolved dramatic problems, beginning with a central premise that is unusual to the point of being bizarre.",1990-03-03T05:00:00+0000

Who could deny that a lot of the freewheeling skyscrapers of the last decade are the architectural equivalent of junk bonds, putting instant visual impact ahead of any kind of rational structure?",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Newhouse Jr. and his brother, Donald, walked out of Federal Tax Court in Washington last week with a victory in one of the biggest tax disputes in I.R.S. history. The court ruled that the estate of Samuel I. Newhouse, the media mogul, was a lot less at the time of his death in 1979 than the $1.32 billion assessment made by the I.R.S. The court agreed with the Newhouse brothers, who are executors of the estate, that their father's holdings were worth only about $237 million. The I.R.S. claimed that based on its valuation of the Newhouse companies - Advance Publications, which controls around 50 newspapers and the Conde Nast magazine group; and Newhouse Broadcasting, then the owner of five television stations -the estate owed more than $600 million. Last week's ruling meant that the I.R.S. would have to settle for what the Newhouses have already paid, $48 million. Said a Newhouse lawyer, ''We are very pleased.''",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Its interior has been designed to resemble a bare-beamed SoHo loft, and its sound system speaks riffy American jazz. The food, however, is spicy Taiwanese: pork dumplings, sauteed pumpkin with garlic, minced chicken in lettuce. The restaurant is the second of this name to be opened in Tokyo by Kiddieland, an upscale Japanese toy store. To find most places in Tokyo requires elaborate directions since locations aren't numbered - there are no addresses - but you can get your bearings from the Famous Amos shop near nearby, and the Mexican restaurant, La Jolla, which is just across the street. Young mothers naturally frequent Dynasty Hao after purchasing Cabbage Patch dolls and Babar books at Kiddieland. I'm told that their favorite drink is Perrier flavored with a Japanese plum brandy. The restaurant's liquor list spells it ''Perie'' but Perrier is what it is. Misspellings are part of the fun. So is incomprehensibility. (A place in Nagoya calls itself Cafe L'emoi. I don't know whether the sign is trying to advertise the Me Cafe, or whether it really means to call itself Cafe Flutter - better yet, Cafe Anxiety. Perhaps, to the Japanese, it only says French.) Minced pigeon is a popular dish in many of Tokyo's Chinese restaurants, although the bird is sometimes surreptitiously replaced by chicken. However, if your food is Taiwanese, your surroundings American, your management Japanese, your owner a toy store with a California-style name, then it scarcely matters what has been minced and hidden in the hay: what you are eating is pidgin.",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

The ballet, a lighthearted tribute to fashion in the 1920's, starred the 20-year-old dancer Anton Dolin in a role created to show off his gymnastic skills. Adding to the work's allure was its cast of artistic collaborators: Bronislava Nijinska, Vaslav Nijinsky's sister, contributed the choreography; Jean Cocteau, the libretto; Darius Milhaud, the score; Gabrielle ''Coco'' Chanel, costumes; the Romanian sculptor Henri Laurens, sets, and Pablo Picasso, curtain. Despite its popularity, however, ''Le Train Bleu'' vanished from the Ballets Russes repertory in 1925 when Dolin left the company.

us,  NONFICTION,"THE VOICE OF THE CITY: Vaudeville and Popular Culture in New York. By Robert W. Snyder. (Oxford University, $19.95.) Vaudeville may be dead, but traces definitely remain. Comedians like George Burns and Milton Berle have enjoyed long careers based on timing and sketches perfected in front of vaudeville's unforgiving audiences. At the height of its popularity, vaudeville theaters stretched in a circuit that covered most of the country. But, more than any other city, New York represented the economic, spiritual and performance center of vaudeville. Robert W. Snyder, a research fellow at Columbia University, traces the story in ''The Voice of the City,'' a rather academic study of the ways vaudeville reflected and exploited popular culture in New York. The book is well researched (with an exhaustive bibliography) and tells some interesting stories about vaudeville's evolution, as the noisy and often unsavory patrons dubbed ''gallery gods'' were cleaned up and cleared out, and vaudeville became ''decent'' family entertainment (and more profitable as well). There were many conflicts behind the song and dance, Mr. Snyder writes, and this was not surprising given vaudeville's adaptable partnership with an ethnically diverse New York; the Keith-Albee organization's booking monopoly; the union-busting efforts by management; the treatment of black performers, who were usually limited to one per vaudeville bill and imitated by white entertainers. These stories, quirky profiles and excerpts from vintage vaudeville routines reflect the vitality of the performers. But the many repetitions and detours in ''Voice of the City'' make Mr. Snyder's journey seem longer than its 220 pages.",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

In fact, I wonder why I've never been on a gorgeous tropical island. My favorite Broadway number is still ''Bali Ha'i,'' from ''South Pacific,'' with its romantic longing for lush, waterlapped surroundings, and its seductive refrain, ''Come to me, come to me.'' And there's probably something innate that keeps drawing me, like a lemming, to water. As a child in Brooklyn, I headed for Coney Island every chance I had. When I was a suburban housewife, it was the sirens of Long Island Sound whose song I heard. Now, my midday respite from the computer usually includes a short walk to Carl Schurz Park, where staring at the East River clears those lines of green letters from the backs of my eyes. But there are no palm trees or bougainvillea in any of these places, and most of my recent, work-related travels have been to landlocked universities. No writing workshop on Aruba or Tahiti has ever crooned, ''Come to me, come to me.'' There have also been perfectly valid reasons for not choosing a tropical vacation: hurricanes, political unrest, overbooked airlines and hotels . . .",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Gradually it attained the status of a disreputable Mecca, something between Anthony Hope's Ruritania and Malcolm Bradbury's Slaka. It was with alarm that I read of Ceausescu's attempts to raze the familiar outlines of the old city, replace it with stony monoliths in his own image. For cities can be destroyed - are indeed terribly fragile things: go looking for true monuments of Dickens's London and see how many you find. But I still hope that, once I go behind the hard-faced boulevards celebrating the (temporary) victories of Ceausescuvian Communism, I will find the sleazy back streets, the decrepit churches with the peeling gold leaf and the unsavory cleric, the unimportant government offices where one must slip bribes to get anything done, the peasants selling half-rotten produce from barrows, the bawling fishwives and the street urchins who will practice their English on you and pick your pockets while they are doing it.",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

us,  THE COURT PHOTOGRAPHER OF BEBOP,"If the kingdom of bebop had a court photographer, it was surely Herman Leonard. Among his sharply etched black-and-white studies are some of the most famous images of such musicians as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Fats Navarro and the others who spearheaded modern jazz during the 1940's and 50's. Shot mostly in nightclubs, Mr. Leonard's photographs have an almost film-noir drama about them; the musicians are often back- or side-lighted and crisscrossed with shadows. His characteristically high focus caught every pore and every drop of sweat on his subjects' faces, and every curl of cigarette smoke hanging in the air. Partly for this reason, THE EYE OF JAZZ (Viking, $29.95), a handsome collection of Mr. Leonard's photographs, has a somewhat static feeling about it. Most jazz photographers like to give a sense of time moving around their images. Mr. Leonard did not; he tended to apotheosize his subjects by his exquisite attention to composition and photographic values, in somewhat the same manner as his mentor, Yousuf Karsh. The short portfolios here are arranged by subject, and each has a brief introduction by Mr. Leonard. If this collection sometimes resembles a gallery of icons more than a series of moments snatched from the stream of time, the best of these photographs nonetheless manage to evoke the mordant precision of the music itself.",1990-03-04T05:00:00+0000

The fact that a month-old baby ''should be calm'' but isn't is used as evidence that the infant is suffering from the effects of prenatal substance abuse.

Father Ritter repeatedly denied the charges, but prosecutors began looking into his alleged financial improprieties and the Franciscan order suspended him from Covenant House.

Moates in her prologue to ''A Bridge of Childhood.'' ''He was a squeaky-voiced homosexual who drank too much.'' A rather crotchety view, but typical of the unreverential squint taken at Truman Capote in this homespun reminiscence. A series of anecdotes narrated by Capote's cousin, Jennings Faulk Carter, the book was edited and polished by the unapologetically middlebrow Ms. Moates, a freelance writer. ''Never know what he'll write next,'' she quotes Mr. Carter's mother as remarking. ''He told me he was going to write about some hooligans who murdered a whole family out in Kansas. Can't imagine why he'd want to write about that!'' Mr. Carter's own voice is just as folksy but, fortunately, shrewder. Much of his material would be fascinating simply as a social history of a vanished world - rural Alabama in the 1930's - even if it offered no insights into the growth of a writer; many of the episodes read like the adventures of an Alabama Tom Sawyer, as Mr. Carter, Capote and their good pal Nelle Harper Lee (later to write ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' in which the character of Dill is modeled on the boy Truman) get up to all kinds of high jinks staging homemade freak shows, digging up skeletons and nearly breaking their necks at the old millpond.

The former K.G.B. major said that after escaping from Moscow with the help of Central Intelligence agents in 1981, he had told the Americans that there were two State Department sources who were helping the K.G.B., that the K.G.B. had deeply penetrated French intelligence agencies, and that the K.G.B. was behind the 1981 attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II.

Are they still there? I do not know. But in that room an old man of 82, taken ill while in secret flight from his unhappy marriage, from the pitiless glare of the world's admiration, from the contradictions of a life lived in luxury while he preached poverty, lay doing as he had always done, writing, until at last, his notebook fallen on the floor, his fingers traced words on the bed sheet. He had hoped to go away and die in peace and anonymity, but there in Astapovo, the world claimed him one last time. Journalists, government officials, disciples, priests and police settled in a thick mass outside the little tin-roofed shack. His estranged wife chartered a special train to bring her to his side but was not allowed to see him. There, on Nov. 7, 1910, Count Leo Tolstoy died. Mankind erects monuments to great men, statues, triumphal arches, tombs. From that little room in Astapovo his body went out to a funeral such as no other novelist has ever known.

The hair styles! What pretensions! What a hoot it all was! Weren't we silly! That about sizes it up for SIXTIES PEOPLE (Knopf, $24.95) by Jane Stern and Michael Stern, whose previous books include ''Elvis World'' and ''Square Meals.'' The current book is packaged as a collection of sociological essays on the generation that was. The chapters have titles like ''Perky Girls,'' ''Playboys,'' ''Hippies,'' ''Folkniks'' and ''Young Vulgarians.'' The content is part humor, part insightful observation and part just self-congratulatory in-jokes that tend to overstate the obvious. Everyone knows people dressed and acted bizarrely in the years between 1958 and 1967. But the reasons everyone was so durned peculiar and angry is never satisfactorily addressed. The essays are exceedingly sarcastic, a tone not tempered by the confession of the authors that they too were 60's people of the pseudo-hippie variety. Heaven knows, it's easy enough to make fun of the 60's generation - it's a bit like shooting fish in a barrel. We need some explanations, and the Sterns never provide them. The book is well researched and chock-full of fun facts - did you remember that Casey was Barbie's English friend? But that just leaves you wanting more: why were things that way, and have we changed at all? Even more irritating, the writing is erratic. Sometimes the essays are engaging, others plod like a 60's term paper. There is a wonderful book in here somewhere, but finding it is difficult. SHARON LIVETEN",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The ethics panel looked into whether hebroke the rules when he allowed a group of investors to raise $105,000 to promote the book, paying his wife, Marianne, more than $10,000.

At the Chicago conspiracy trial 20 years ago, the judge gently scolded Tom Hayden: ''Fellows as smart as you could do awfully well under [the American] system.'' Those words would have been lost on Abbie Hoffman, who remained, in his actions and, as this book shows, in his writings, incorrigibly and imaginatively subversive to the end. The self-styled ''cultural revolutionary'' - who committed suicide last year at the age of 52 and has since become, as Norman Mailer says in his foreword, ''our own holy ghost of the Left'' - chose the selections here from ''Revolution for the Hell of It'' (1968), ''Woodstock Nation'' (1969) and ''Steal This Book'' (1971). To those Daniel Simon has added essays and speeches from the 1980's, when Hoffman, no longer on the run from a drug charge, was working as an environmentalist and still trying to stir up student activism. What set him apart was his wit, a virtue as rare in American politics as it is in American comedy. This is his account of the ''language barrier'' between a zonked Yippie and members of the House Un-American Activities Committee: ''They spoke of Marx and I thought they meant Groucho. My interpreter said, 'No, they mean Karl Marx.' They spoke of Lenin and I thought they meant John Lennon of the Beatles. My interpreter said, 'No, they mean the guy without a first name.' '' If you liked Abbie - and don't mind reading about be-ins, bad acid trips and ''the politics of ecstasy'' - you'll like this collection. But it isn't really ''The Best of Abbie Hoffman.'' We saw the best of Abbie Hoffman inside a Federal courthouse, and outside the walls of the Pentagon.",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

Jonathan, a much beloved American who teaches literature and poetry in Rio de Janeiro, has been set up. A guerrilla named Verlande has tricked him into a compromising situation and the innocent academic has become ''a temporary liability'' who must be sent stateside. Eventually, Jonathan will depart as ordered, but before then he'll endure a rush of death squads, psychic rambling, political machinations and renewed love, all washed down by prodigious amounts of alcohol. Jonathan, aside from being a borderline drunk, is also something of a mystic, and so he is perfectly at home in Brazil, a surreal country where ''two parallel streets meet'' - although to Arthur, a hard-nosed diplomat, Jonathan is ''in the wrong time'' and doesn't realize that what's real ''can't be wiped away by dreams and by the imagination.'' Because he doesn't know this, Jonathan is delighted to enter a bizarre universe of plot and counterplot in which revolutionaries are closet Jesuits, while beggars turn into Nazi-hunting philosophers. In the course of their last days in Brazil, the scholar discovers himself; his wife, Carol, rediscovers sex; and readers find themselves weaving through a sometimes impenetrable jungle of metaphor and symbol. An unfinished cathedral; Jonathan's unbuilt dream of a literature center (his ''White Dove''); a ''mulata princess''; Roberto, the professor's double; even Burt Lancaster and Sir Thomas Browne come to represent different shades of the story's meaning. All this imagery is fine, if laid on a bit too thick, since a tangled plot sometimes needs a tangled telling. But the occasional overwriting (''I walk on the borrowings of the sun'') does give pause, for it detracts from an otherwise fine and engaging novel.",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, does not want the vote to take place. Nor does the Mayor of New York City, David N. Dinkins. Nor, it seems, do most state legislators from New York City, who were responsible for scheduling the vote in the first place. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely, no matter what Staten Island voters want, that the borough will ever separate from New York City. So why is the vote taking place? The answer is a lesson in the twisted logic that sometimes prevails in the State Capitol.

No one goes there to eat. Of all the Tuscan towns, Siena has the worst reputation for restaurants. One guidebook advises avoiding restaurants altogether; just buy some cold cuts, it says, and head out of town for a picnic. Other guides are similarly unenthusiastic. But then most of the travel books we get are not written by Italians.

The 10 stories collected in ''Economies of the Heart'' document a poor boy's introduction to the brutish world of manual labor, a world he chooses to enter so he'll make enough money to escape to college. Christopher Zenowich's protagonist is Bob Bodewicz, a younger version of the hero of Mr. Zenowich's recent novel, ''The Cost of Living.'' In the first two stories, which tell of abortive attempts to make money by raising chinchillas and reopening an old nickel mine, Bob learns that schemes will not suffice. The subsequent stories recount Bob's real jobs, first cleaning up a rat-infested factory and then toiling on his cousin's farm. The most inspired story is ''Field Work,'' in which Bob's near-Sisyphean task is to clear a seven-acre field whose stones have risen to the surface, as they do every few years. But while Mr. Zenowich is adept at evoking the spirit as well as the mechanics of hard physical labor, his portrayal of people is less than convincing. Even Bob, who is depicted almost exclusively at work, remains thinly drawn. The problem is partially a function of the book's form: the discrete stories inhibit the development of character, which might not be the case in a novel. The stories do not always add new dimensions, and at times the author repeats himself unnecessarily. The stories - selected snapshots of Bob's life - consider only the worst labors he must endure, such as picking out the stones and spreading manure in the fields. A bountiful harvest, however, is never reaped.",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,  FICTION,"IF I NEVER GET BACK. By Darryl Brock. (Crown, $18.95.) Submitted for your approval: Sam Fowler, a frustrated crime-and-disaster reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle whose wife has left him for a television anchorman, boards a train in Cleveland after his father's funeral, collapses and wakes up in 1869, surrounded by the Cincinnati Red Stockings, just as they are about to begin their legendary 64-0 season. The team invites Fowler to join them on their tour. Darryl Brock has researched the period so minutely and writes of baseball's early years with such affection that the reader cheerfully surrenders his disbelief to this winsome fantasy. Fowler visits Rochester, the ''Flour City'' filled with wheat dust, and Troy, N.Y., then a larger steel capital than Pittsburgh, with a mutton-chopped band of athletes whose future Hall of Famer, George Wright, makes less for the season than Will Clark now earns in an inning. Armed with 120 years of baseball history unknown to his teammates, Fowler invents the bunt, the intentional walk, even hot dogs, hamburgers and Cracker Jack. But the course of time-travel adventure does not run entirely smoothly. Our hero enrages sinister gamblers and falls in love with a teammate's sister, who embroils him in the doomed Fenian political intrigue to free Ireland. In his spare time, Fowler tours Manhattan with his literary idol, Mark Twain, to whose ''Connecticut Yankee'' Mr. Brock's book owes tribute. Hunted by gunmen and revolutionaries, will Fowler ever get back to his own century? Does he want to? Mr. Brock keeps the reader eager to find out. Beyond the first-novelist flaws - some fatty prose, a narrative viewpoint a bit inflated and self-conscious - this is an engrossing, even charming tale. By its final inning, the reader is sad to see it end.",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

At first glance, Mr. Minkow had the look of a modern-day Horatio Alger hero - an energetic if rough-edged lower-middle-class teen-ager who, while still in high school, had made the startling entrepreneurial leap from cleaning carpets after school to founding his own carpet-cleaning company, ZZZZ Best. From there, Joe Domanick says in ''Faking It in America,'' he catapulted his small business into a fast-growing concern; in April 1987 he was reputed to be worth $100 million. The news media soon touted Mr. Minkow as a rising star, and he did deserve scrutiny, but not for his business acumen: a multimillionaire at the age of 21, by 22 Mr. Minkow had been convicted of defrauding banks and investors of an estimated $40 million and sentenced to a Federal prison term of 25 years. It turned out that the charismatic Wunderkind had been a schemer from the start; at one point he even stole his grandmother's jewelry to stay afloat. In fact, all along ZZZZ Best seems to have been an elaborate pyramid scheme, powered by extravagant lies and fabricated deals. Mr. Domanick documents Mr. Minkow's rise and fall in vivid and painstaking detail. Unfortunately, what is lacking is a deeper probing of both the self-aggrandizing (and ultimately self-destructive) psychology that drove Mr. Minkow and his associates to defraud, and the dreams and illusions that allowed his investors to be duped.",1990-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, recently introduced a ''two-step'' mortgage for first-time buyers, and now 80 lenders around the country offer it. To date these lenders have committed $800 million to the new mortgage. The two-step mortgage, a cross between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages, begins with a low interest rate, which is adjusted only once, after seven years, to a new rate that cannot be more than 6 percentage points higher than the initial rate. Rates on these mortgages are based on a formula tied to the 10-year United States Treasury bill. Here is a national sample of the range of interest rates being charged for various mortgages. Banks will charge points, each point being 1 percent of the mortgage; the more points a buyer can pay, the lower the mortgage interest rate will be. $ Type of Mortgage Current Rate Year Ago Two-Step 9.825%-10.25% N.A. 30-year fixed 10.25%-10.75% 11.00% Adjustable 8.40%-8.50% 9.00%-9.50%",1990-03-17T05:00:00+0000

''Successful counterfeiting requires not only skill, patience and a great deal of capital to buy the range of complex machinery which is the forger's stock-in-trade, but an intense appreciation of security.'' So instructs Charles Black, a British master forger who in the 1970's devised and developed a sophisticated method of photolithographic counterfeiting. With Michael Horsnell of The Times of London, Mr. Black tells the strange saga of his escapades in counterfeiting, which began at his home in Kent, where he assembled a cedar shed that, he boasts, was ''the finest forger's den in the history of counterfeiting.'' Police officials later discovered the plates for dollar and pound notes and traveler's checks drawn on the Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster banks, along with an offset litho machine, a hand letterpress printing machine, numbering boxes and a supply of magnetic ink. Mr. Black claims that his operation was the biggest forgery production center in the world. A set of his printing plates and a series of his forged bank notes are preserved in Scotland Yard's museum of criminal artifacts. However, the story of Mr. Black's techniques, goals and encounters with the law is less amusing than he and Mr. Horsnell seem to think. Mr. Black is a little too pleased with his accomplishments in ''the art of counterfeiting.'' He forgets that the ''art'' is also a threat to national security and international economies - and a felony.",1990-03-18T05:00:00+0000

All the more reason to welcome the spring of 1990 as a season of real - and sometimes radical - shifts in style. Conventional tailoring hasn't been scrapped so much as re-examined, with the emphasis on comfort, mobility and self-expression. It is Giorgio Armani who has made the first move to alter the shape of the 1990's. In a surprising about-face, the Milanese inventor of the angular, big-shouldered and much-imitated power suit has turned away from his own tradition. The new Armani jacket - patterned on the English model, with its natural shoulders and nipped waist - is long, lean and liberating. Its loose fit and non-aggressive spirit have left their mark on men's fashions this year. Also changed is the way clothes are worn. Combinations that seemed jarring a decade ago suddenly make sense. It's a rare man these days who hasn't tossed a foul-weather parka over a business suit or dressed down a blazer with a rugged denim shirt.

Half of ''Night and Fog'' is the story of the Norwegian Arne Brun Lie's year as a political prisoner of the occupying Nazi Government. The other half is the story of how Mr. Lie got up the nerve to talk about that year. The two halves run alongside each other the length of the book and somehow never quite cohere. That can be a bit jarring, but it is not really a problem, because Mr. Lie, an inexperienced writer who worries about ''the clumsy feel of a pen in my hands,'' with the help of Robby Robinson, an English teacher in Massachusetts, writes engagingly and well. Mr. Lie was a schoolboy who had just begun training with the Norwegian Resistance and had not yet shot a gun when the Nazis ''disappeared'' him and put him in a special ''night and fog'' camp for enemies of the state. (''Night and fog'' was the Nazi designation for their program for political prisoners; they stamped its initials on uniforms, broke its victims down with ''cat-and-mouse torment instead of instant death'' and called them ''the already dead.'') Forty years later, Mr. Lie skippered a 37-foot cutter from Boston to Oslo and, during long watches, talked out his repressed memories. The moral of the story is that he survived through dreams: Arne Brun Lie the camp prisoner dreamed of meat pudding, sailboats, fjords and even elephants, while Arne Brun Lie the survivor dreamed guiltily about surviving and was finally tortured by dreams into speech. The tragedy of it, for a world where ''disappearing'' and abusing political prisoners is still commonplace, is that it took Mr. Lie so long to talk - and, by talking, to heal.",1990-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Though millions of other Americans uprooted themselves in those years, the travails of the ''Okies''captured attention in a way those of other groups did not.

When the aliens land, I hope Carol Emshwiller is around to explain what's up with Earth women these days. She certainly knows how to take the Martian view of ordinary domestic life - how to get at the truth of things by rendering them strange. The best tales in ''Verging on the Pertinent,'' her second collection of short stories, accomplish this with sly wit or brainy despair; more often it's both. There's a neglected wife who tries to escape her marriage by trekking into the mountains and taking up with a bear who might be better suited for family life. Soon, though, he's lumbering in at 3 A.M. ''As usual,'' she thinks, watching him turn his shaggy back on her and fall asleep. Disappointments are lurking for men, too, especially the ones who go in for the apotheosis of feminine beauty. Thus a nice-enough guy guarding a statue of a woman in Washington Square is horrified when a real woman is found to be living inside. She has a breakfast nook and dusty window sills. She strings her wash between the statue's knees. ''You can't hang underwear here,'' the man protests feebly. ''You have to find another place. This is art.'' Then there's the saga of Queen Kong, a giantess who scales the World Trade Center clutching ''a fairly important and rather fat executive'' at the end of a bad day. Only some of the 17 stories are this fierce or funny; others seem to lose their way. And it's tough to curl up with the whole collection at once; it's too cerebral, too coolly ironic for that. But read this book slowly, with time off between the tales, and you start to appreciate how often Ms. Emshwiller works like some intrepid surveyor, stepping back as far as possible without falling over the edge.",1990-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,  NONFICTION,"The quincentenary of Columbus's discovery of the New World is upon us, and Franco Cardini's EUROPE 1492: Portrait of a Continent Five Hundred Years Ago (Facts on File, $50) is disguised as a commemoration of that event. More accurately, the book is a general treatment of European life at the end of the 15th century. (Mr. Cardini seldom uses the word Renaissance, preferring to think of the period as an overlap of the Middle Ages and the modern world.) His book begins with a portentous description of Columbus's first sighting of land at San Salvador and a hint that other events of 1492 (the death of Lorenzo de' Medici and the expulsion of the Arabs and the Jews from Spain) were equally symbolic of the transition from the old world to the new. But those ideas are never developed, and Columbus is scarcely to be heard from again. That quibble aside, ''Europe 1492'' consists of page after page of beautiful, wonderfully well-chosen details from paintings, woodcuts and manuscript illuminations by Botticelli, Bosch, Memling and other masters, which cast light on diverse aspects of life in the period. The intelligent but undemanding narrative, sprinkled with passages from Vasari, Machiavelli and other Renaissance figures, provides an agreeable accompaniment to the illustrations. There are routine sections on the politics, religion and cultural differences of Europe, but Mr. Cardini, a professor of medieval history at the universities of Bari and Florence, is most entertaining in his discussion of the somewhat offbeat: peripheral populations in Europe (Africans, Muslims, gypsies, Jews), other alienated groups such as beggars, foundlings and lepers, and the widespread poverty, cruelty, disease and physical discomfort that are not always a part of the popular view of the Renaissance.

The symphonies with which he is most readily identified, though, are Beethoven's, and in that material his recording statistics are impressive. He made no fewer than four complete recordings of the nine in less than 35 years, following individual recordings of Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 9, and managed to work in another one of No. 7 along the way (for a total of six versions of that work).",1990-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The architect the museum hired was Michael Graves - not the internationally famous Michael Graves of today, architect of Whitney Museum additions and Walt Disney World hotels, but the young and struggling Michael Graves of 1967, a faculty member at the Princeton University School of Architecture. That was the year Mr. Graves was recommended to the Newark Museum's director, Samuel C. Miller, as a talented comer.

Mrs. Reagan said that Ms. Quigley's advice had nothing to do with policy. But Ms. Quigley contends in her book, ''What Does Joan Say?,'' that through Mrs. Reagan she had ''a direct line to the President'' that she used to persuade him to, among other things, change his attitude toward Mikhail S.

The novelist Marilyn Coffey has put together an entertaining, insightful collection of stories, combining fact and legend, about her beloved central plains between the mid-1880's and the late 1950's. ''Like a speck on the eastern horizon appears a wagon loaded with Coffeys,'' who in 1885 migrated west to the Great Plains from Illinois. There were 10 of them - great-grandfather James, his wife, Mary, their seven sons and a daughter. The Coffey boys were a raucous bunch who liked a good joke, usually physical, and would try anything once - great-uncle Ben even entered a ''bear-wrassling'' contest and won. Stories of the family are integrated with graphic firsthand descriptions by survivors of the natural disasters that periodically struck the Plains - floods, grasshopper infestations, tornadoes, man-made mischief on a grand scale. Ms. Coffey offers insights on what it is to grow up in Middle America. It ''gives one a different perspective on history than the typical Easterner has, an inside-out view.'' As a child, she ''never doubted for an instant'' that she ''was dead center in the middle of everything . . . a world narrowed by dust storms, bread lines, and Al Capone.''",1990-03-25T05:00:00+0000

I decided that I should buy an Italian book; I went into a bookstore and my eye fell on Natalia Ginzburg's Le piccole virtu. I don't know why that was the book I decided to buy; there were other Italian writers I knew and had read. Perhaps it was her name - suggesting ethnic complications. Perhaps it was the title - ''The Little Virtues'' - which appealed to me as a new way of looking at the moral life. Perhaps it was the fact that it was by a woman - Ginzburg may have been the only woman writer whose books were in the bookstore - and in 1971, a fledgling writer myself and a feminist enthusiastic at the birth of the new movement, I was eager for connections with writers of my own sex.",1990-03-25T05:00:00+0000

He loves comfort, especially comfort of the high-tech, high-gloss kind. He would be indistinguishable from any other fashionably louche high roller were it not for his more or less selfless interest in the affairs of others. Like any self-respecting devil, he enjoys watching others go wrong. Seducing his prey, however, is a very different game compared with what it used to be. It was once easy enough to further the cause of corruption simply by playing upon the avarice of potential victims. But today's target could be too well- heeled to care about financial temptation. If anything, the reverse may even be true: today's bright-eyed young corporate type may already have been showered with more material success than he knows what to do with.

Hotchner, the author of ''Papa Hemingway,'' a classic of Hemingway hagiography, has hit the trail again and served up in HEMINGWAY AND HIS WORLD (Vendome Press, $45) an encyclopedic buffet, full of fascinating rare photos of Hemingway and others, as well as color photos of book jackets, memorabilia and scenes from such favorite locales as Paris, Italy, Spain and Africa. The text is arranged chronologically, with entries on the novelist's friends, wives and favorite places, as well as cities and historical events identified with him. Although he works almost exclusively with information that has been sitting out on the literary steam table for years, the author manages to give a sense of the wide swath that Hemingway cut through this century. Mr. Hotchner, who was a friend of Hemingway's, tends to insert himself into the book at inappropriate times, like someone straining to be included in a group photograph, and more than a few warmed-over chestnuts from ''Papa Hemingway'' are served up undisguised. As a result, ''Hemingway and His World'' plays musical chairs, circling memoir and biography but never sitting down. But, even with its weaknesses, this handsome, appealing book provides a satisfying overview of the trajectory of the novelist's life, a movable feast if ever there was one.",1990-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,  Small World,"Sometimes science is served best by unscientific methods. For years researchers wondered if the hairy-eared dwarf lemur still existed; they had never seen one alive. Last week it was reported that the animal, the second smallest primate (the mouse lemur is smaller in dry seasons), was alive and well in a Madagascar rain forest. Braving leeches and malaria, a West German biologist, Bernhard Meier, spotted four of the creatures last year. The event was called one of the biggest rediscoveries of a mammal in a decade. Just 5 1/2 inches long, with a 7-inch tail and weighing 3 1/2 ounces, the animal jumps like a cricket and eats bugs while hanging from branches. How did Mr. Meier find them? One lemur appeared in his headlight beam one night. And the others? The key was a stray dog that joined his search party. The guides lifted the dog up to sniff holes in trees, and at one point he began to bark. ''That was the secret to how we found them,'' Mr. Meier said.

us,  THE AUTHOR FROM CALCUTTA,"SATYAJIT RAY: The Inner Eye. By Andrew Robinson. (University of California, $29.95.) Film buffs will be fascinated by ''Satyajit Ray,'' a study of India's most widely acclaimed director. Born into a gifted Calcutta family in 1921, Mr. Ray shot his first movie, ''Pather Panchali,'' with amateur actors and no script; its budget was so minuscule that at one point the director had to pawn his wife's jewelry to buy lunch for his crew. The film went on to win him international recognition for its haunting, lyric beauty, and his subsequent work has put him in the ranks of the leading directors. Most of Andrew Robinson's impressively researched book discusses the 34 movies Mr. Ray made from 1950 to 1989, as well as his music, his fiction and the children's magazine he has edited since 1961. There are shooting diaries, detailed backgrounds to the scripts and insightful critiques of Mr. Ray's films gleaned from reviews and interviews with the film maker. Only about a quarter of the book is biographical. Even here, the author is more interested in discussing Mr. Ray's development as an artist than in giving a personal account of the man himself. A single paragraph covers Mr. Ray's courtship and marriage; his wife is scarcely mentioned thereafter, though his close family life has been very important to him. He emerges as a modest, friendly but extremely private person. Still, Mr. Robinson, a television producer in England, uses his informal writing style to illuminate the director's genius, and the 150 photos and illustrations provide visual testimony to Satyajit Ray's immense contributions to the world of film.",1990-03-25T05:00:00+0000

As Seventh Avenue's top designers and manufacturers gear up for the all-important showings that start this week and crescendo the next, it is clear that no dramatic silhouette shifts are in store. Hemlines are staying short (designers showing them mid-thigh, but planning to ship them above the knee); shoulders keep some padding (but only a bit); shorts often replace skirts; dresses become as basic a necessity as skirts, and clothes still delineate the figure (though in a less structured manner). Layering continues to be the most desirable way to dress. No controversy here. The kick will come from the contradictions. For example, designers have become captivated by a pastel palette that conjures up Easter more than it does Labor Day. Fabrics usually associated with daytime, like tweed and flannel, are being cut up for evening wear - or the other way around. Bare dresses that one would think appropriate for night are being shown for day, under coats or jackets.

us,  FICTION,"LOOSE JAM. By Wayne Wilson. (Delacorte, $17.95.) Poor Henry Brown. Standing on his redwood porch in yuppified Morro Bay, Calif., this Vietnam veteran, sometime guitarist, record-store manager and reluctant hero of Wayne Wilson's ''Loose Jam'' sees his old Army buddy Miles Duckworth coming right for him. Miles, a one-legged casualty of the war and the 60's, is ''humping along between those crutches like some strung-out apostle with a load of bad news that just couldn't wait.'' The news is that a maniacal veteran, nursing a grudge from the war, has found Miles and wants his blood - and maybe Henry's too. Miles, who once played a mean piano (''the voice of a generation,'' said the album notes), is disgusted by the new life Henry has made for himself in their 15 years apart. So he helps Henry lose his job as ''a flunky for a bunch of . . . suits'' and nearly destroys his house. Henry and Martha, his beloved, are compelled to help Miles escape to Ventura, but the wrathful veteran, known for more than half the book only as the Policy Man, tracks them down for the novel's predictably violent denouement. And, in the process, what might have been a series of bluesy riffs on redemption or reconciliation, or the inevitability of retribution, turns into a plodding arpeggio. In this first novel, the characters mouth cliches that recall the worst excesses of Kerouac, and there is very little that is evocative, insightful or sympathetic. The fractured plot cuts between the here-and-now, the way-back-when and the just-a-few-hours-ago, and coincidences wait in ambush like snipers. But the brief excursions back to Vietnam are diverting, if only because they distract us from the dreariness of Mr. Wilson's boozy, dope-filled New Age California.",1990-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Martinez will be the first to turn up under the Governor's second-floor window at the State Capitol in Albany selling hot dogs, knishes and soda. Mr. Martinez, a former heroin addict who was often described as ''inspiring'' by Mr. Cuomo, was pressured into resigning as the state commissioner of drug treatment in December after an investigation found that drug-treatment money he had steered to programs run by his friends failed to treat anybody. Mr. Martinez, who denies the accusations, said last week that he had obtained his vendor's permit for a spot on the sidewalk next to the Capitol and will open his hot dog cart for business tomorrow. The former commissioner, who now calls himself ''the knishener,'' said he just wanted to sell hot dogs and was not trying to annoy the Governor. Mr. Cuomo, he said, is still one of his heroes.

It would probably be impossible to see Miss Smith in a play or movie - or, for that matter, the subway - without realizing who she was; there is something about Maggie Smith that announces itself. But it would be quite easy to watch Miss Tyzack in a riveting solo performance one night and fail to recognize her at breakfast the next day.

Among the problems most deserving of attention: How to turn the Presidential debates into substantive exchanges rather than packaged preenings? How to resist cluttering the evening news with ''photo opportunities'' that allow press agents to peddle their goods? How to combat political commercials that play loose with facts? And how to counter the predilection of television news itself for the peppy picture and the snappy quote?",1990-03-26T05:00:00+0000
