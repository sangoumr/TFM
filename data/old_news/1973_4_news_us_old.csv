us,"Who, Said Sue, Said Whoo?; By Ellen Raskin. Illustrated by the author. Unpaged. New York: Atheneum. $4.95. (Ages 4 to 8)","A familiar guessing game receives fresh and funny treatment in Ellen Raskin's little teaser about a small girl and her unlikely hitchhikers. Sue, fashionably 1930ish moppet drives a roadster of comparable vintage through a maze of stylized vegetation that hides an assortment of animals making a corresponding assortment of sounds. What's the animal, and can you find it? And who's making the offstage chitterchatter? Therein lies the game. Miss Raskin's departure, however, lies in the art. In a delightful variation on the old joke about fitting elephants into a Volkswagen, the tiny twoseater and its diminutive driver pick up a zoofull of riders, ranging from a small black shrew to a huge orange gnu. (My favorite is a gentle yellow cow obviously in search of mother.) As the passengers increase in this unlikely ark, so does the ingenuity of Miss Raskin's design, a blend of visual elegance and pure slap",1973-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Richardson, who spoke on the Meet the Press television program, said that it would be very difficult for the Cambodian Goyernment to survive without United States air support because of a massive threat by wellarmed, wellorganized guerrilla forces, which include forces from North Vietnam itself. [Page 1, Column 8.]President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam arrived in Los Angeles for two days of meetings with President Nixon at his home in San. Clemente, 60 miles south of Los Angeles. Mr. Thieu's visit, his first since he became President in 1967, is intended mainly to enhance his stature at home, but also to change the minds of at least some American critics who regard him as a petty dictator. [3:4.8.]Capt. Robert T. White of the Army, the last United States war prisoner in Indochina, arrived at Clark Air Base in the Philippines after a release that until the last minute he feared might be a trick. Captain White, 32 years old and from Newport News, Va., was flown from Saigon after his release in a Mekong Delta village. Meanwhile, the last group of American war prisoners arrived at Travis Air Force Base in California, ending Operation Homecoming, which brought back 587 men freed from Communist prison camps. [2:46.]Under James R. Schlesinger, its new director, the Central Intelligence Agency is apparently planning to curtail some of its old activities, notably clandestine military operations, and undertake new ones, including action against political terrorism and the international drug traffic. [1:67.]NationalSenator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut and a member of the Senate committee investigating the. Watergate bugging case, said that James W.

It's not the cheap sightandsound effects in his opening segment I'm referring tosights like old Doc Metcalf's hair, which at the touch of the sunappears to flare into incandescent white ash like the mantle of a lamp (Gadzooks!

""I'm going to be the meanest mack there ever was!"" Goldie vows. He then adds: ""They're going to talk about me the way they used to talk about Jesus.""That doesn't make much sense, but nothing does in this essentially sentimental melodrama. The screenplay by Robert J. Poole uses lines that seem to have been saved from a sophomore's notebook. ""Truth,"" says a white cop, ""is pimples, garlic and armpits."" Says Goldie to a hooker whom he'd known when both were children: ""I thought you'd become a nurse or a lawyer or something heavy."" Or, and this is my favorite wisdom of the week: ""A pimp is only as good as his productand his product is women!""Even as action melodrama of a ""Shaft"" sort, the film is inept, so confused that occasionally it seems surreal???. ???lieve that Goldie, with five girls out hustling on what looks like Skid Row, could clear $3,000 a day.Max Julien seems vaguely uncomfortable impersonating another fantasy-fulfilling movie superblack, but he's genuinely funny in a couple of scenes with Richard Pryor, a first-rate comedian who plays his sidekick.

That is, that a middle-aged man's sexual satisfaction is quite as dangerous as the coronary it will lead to.Are Italian menfor all of their eyeball-rolling when a pretty girl walks by a sidewalk cafe, and for all of their appreciative pinches in crowded busesso guilt-ridden that only death can offer true relief? It would seem that way according to the subcategory of Italian comedy to which ""Come Have Coffee With Us"" belongs. It's, not something that most American men think much about, possibly because we are being constantly reassured of our inexhaustible energy by everything from television commercials to porno films.Yet even if the fear does lurk somewhere within us, it's probably not the reason that ""Come Have Coffee With Us"" seems quite as funny as it does, or, for that matter, why Marco Ferreri's ""The Conjugal Bed"" and Pietro Germi's ""The Climax"" also were so amusing (some years ago). The reason, principally, is Ugo Tognazzi, a fine, very comic actor who, for approximately 20 years now, has been defining the pitfalls of middle-aged passion so eloquently.As in the Ferreri and Germi films, the really ageless Mr. Tognazzi is again impersonating a man whose desires are bigger than his ventricles. This time he plays a petty tax official, assigned to a small town in southern Italy, where he decides to settle down as the husband of a well-to-do but no longer young bourgeoise and finds himself also the lover of his two equally over-age sisters-in-law. It all works beautifully until his roving eye falls on the unattended serving girl.The idea is not terribly funny, but Mr. Tognazzi, and the small town setting provided by Mr. Lattuada, are. The actor is a model of what I can describe only as a thoroughly masculine but dainty self-assurance, whether he is carefully placing a toothpick in an ashtray (after cleaning one ear and one fingernail) or pompously explaining to the three sisters, on an early meeting, how an old war wound has left him with a troublesome (but not incapacitating) deviated rectum. The three women are so smitten that not even a stroke cools their devotion.The sisters are admittedly grotesque (especially the tall one with a huge mole at the side of her mouth), and Mr. Lattuada treats them with a certain comic awe, if not fear. Never for a moment do they suspect their capacity to wound with love. This fantasy, I should emphasize, is not only a man's, but also an Italian man's, and all objections should be directed to him in Rome, where, according to my fantasy, he is at this very minute, sitting in a cafe enjoying the passing parade and the exquisite guilt pangs the parade prompts.",1973-04-06T05:00:00+0000

St. Louis, unlike some smaller towns and rural communi ies up and down the river, ascaped major damage. Most of the city sits on high ground. Lowying commercial areas near the river are protected by levees and flood walls built by the Army Corps of Engineers after the last great flood in 1951. A corps spokesman here estimated that the protective system had prevented $150million worth of damage. Damage was confined to the first floors of few commercial buildings along the downtown waterfront and to about 100 houses in lowlying areas in the southern part of the city. After the flood in 1951 caused several million dollars damage here, the corps upgraded the protection system with $90million worth of new Levees and concrete flood walls. Work Begun on Wall One 300foot section of flood, wallin southern St. Louis remains to be built. Work was begun on it last fall, but the heavy winter rains overtook it. The corps had to throw up temporary earthen dike covered with sheet plastic to block the rising river last week.

But when they Move close to home especially where large numbers of people are hoosed, they become nuisances and can in some instances cause a great deal of damage. One of the most frequently asked, question by homeowners who are plagued by the presence of an unwanted animal, is how do I get rid of it?There are many solutions. Two of the disposal methods that have been used in days past are shooting or poisoning. Both of these methods still work, however, they are not very satisfactory in the confines of our present day communities where unforseeable outcomes may result in most communities, it is unlawful to shoot anything and wisely so as you may hit more than the pest that you wish to get out of your hair. Poisoning, on the other hand, is more controlled than shooting, but it has its drawbacks under our present close living conditions. The number of animals that roam about under such conditions are not all bad. Think of the number of cats and dogs that live within your own neighborhood. What are the alternatives? To select the most, feasible method, consider some of the animals that often visit the home property and explore some of their habits. By knowing something about the animal and its habits, one can focus on these and often devise an effective method to discourage its presence.Moles:.At this time of year, one of the little pests that may have visited you during the past few months without too much notice may have been the mole which is first noticed in the spring often while looking over the condition of the lawn. Ridges and valleys throughout the lawn indicate this little fellow is or was present. Moles are insect  eating mammals and are highly specialized for living beneath the soil so you are not likely to see them above ground. They live almost continually in a. highly organized Systent of tunnels. Moles prodtice only a single litter of young in late April or early May When: their tunnels are made just under the surface, you can: see the ridges clearly. This up rooting of the grass or other plants in the area is what causes plant damage. The mole itself does not feed on plant materials. The mole's damage is caused by tunneling in search of insects and worms, within the soil environment. Since they live underground, moles are difficult to control. Special traps have been designed to enable one to trap them within their tunnels. They are available at most hardware stores. If you choose traps, you must determine where the active tunnels are, as many are only temporary. To find active tunnels, walk across the ridges to push them down. Then keep an eye on them to see if they are repaired. If they are, the tunnels are active and a trap should be placed there. Another method to eliminate moles is to control the bisects that formulate their food supply. Grubs are one of their favorites. These are easily controlled by the use of insecticides such as chlordane or milky spore disease which is specific for Japanese beetle grubs. When the food source is no longer available, the moles will venture elsewhere.",1973-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Zeffirelli's Film Study of St. Francis:The Cast,"Franco Zeffirelli's ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" is the sort of movie that tries to make poverty look chic, and almost goes broke in the attempt.It's the splendiferously costumed, fancily photographed (through rain, smoke, mist or muslin, whenever possible), multimillion-dollar, near-musical life of Giovanni Francesco Bernardone (1181-1226), the cloth merchant's son who later became St. Francis of Assisi. The title is taken from Francis's ""Canticle of Creatures,"" and it could be worse, since Francis had a way of referring to everything as his ""brothers"" or ""sisters,"" including his illnesses. These he called his ""sisters"" and on their part he once begged the pardon of his ""brother ass the body.""Like Roberto Rossellini, who sought the essence of St. Francis more in fable than in fact, Zeffirelli makes no special claims to historical accuracy. However, unlike Rossellini, whose ""Flowers of St. Francis"" is a film of sweet purpose and simplicity, Zeffirelli has made a big, absurd doodad, a movie that confuses simplicity with simple-mindedness and that makes saintliness look like an extreme form of Asian flu.When Francis comes down with it, he gets feverish, hallucinates, goes off into a long coma and then wakes up as a Good Person. We know this because he spends a lot of time weeping for the underprivileged, giving away his daddy's yard goods and hanging out with birds, bees and flowers.The screenplay, written by Zeffirelli with three other people who should be nameless but aren't (see listing), opens with Francis's return from the war with Perugia and his vow to follow the life and teachings of Christ covers the years that finally culminate with the recognition of what was to become the Franciscan order by Pope Innocent III.In a film that isn't exactly devoid of unintentionally funny moments, this last sequence is a standout, when the sack-clothed Francis and his little band of barefoot followers confront Innocent III in a St. Peter's throne room so photographed as to look like a set from a ""Ziegfeld Follies."" Francis's philosophy consists entirely of assorted cribs from the Gospel according to St. Matthew, which Francis hurls around the throne room as if they were thunderbolts instead of familiar quotations. The Pope is so impressed he falls on his knees in front of Francis, at which point we suddenly recognize Innocent III as old Alec Guinness, wearing his famous Fagan beard but not the controversial nose.Guinness and Valentina Cortese (who plays Francis's mother) are the only familiar actors in the film. Graham Faulkner (Francis), Judi Bowker (Clare) and the men who play Francis's followers are all young English actors making their film debuts. They are noteworthy only in that they share a prettiness that is barely distinguishable from the landscape's.Although Zeffirelli has a fondness for posing Francis in attitudes suggested by Christ on the cross, he downplays the visions to, literally, one blinkof the eyes of a statue. Zeffirelli makes Francis seem such a bland sort of fellow that we spend most of the time looking at the scenery, the auroral photographic effects and the costumes, which were also the chief attractions of the director's hugely popular ""Romeo and Juliet.""The film is scored to a point that makes your teeth hurt with awful songs (""Birds are singing sweet and low/ From the trees that gently grow . . ."") by Donovan, sung by him on the soundtrack in a role I assume to be God's.",1973-04-09T05:00:00+0000

The causes range from fascism (Juraj Herz's ""The Cremator"") to anarchy (Claude Faraldo's ""Themroc""), but the movies share a tendency to replace dramatic development with thematic or historical demonstration. For this they pay a high price.The Czechoslovak ""The Cremator"" was made in 1968, and so is not a new film. But, like its director, it is new to us. The central character, a Mr. Kopfrkingl, is the director of a fancy crematorium, happy in his work, who finds that almost without his wishing it the spirit of his times (the very late nineteen-thirties) is propelling him toward the peak of his career: directorship of a super crematorium with massive ovens and all the necessary bodies to burn in them.Kopfrkingl's story, how he feels rising within him the power of his one drop of German blood, how he finally solves the problem of his beloved half-Jewish wife and quarter-Jewish children, is treated with a blend of intelligent theatrical irony and inflated film technique that is so typicaland so typically the limitationof East-European cinema. But Kopfrkingl himself, played by Rudolf Hrusinky, with the face of a gently demonic Charles Laughton and the manner of a malevolent Herbert Marshall, is a creation of considerable interest.I suspect that almost everything outside the film is more interesting than what actually gets into Paul Leduc's ""John Reed: Insurgent Mexico."" It is an account of a famous journalist's involvement with the revolutionary forces of Pancho Villa under Gen. Tomas Urbina that began as a magazine assignment and became a process of personal radicalization.Leduc obviously means to keep his film low keyat which, alas, he more than succeeds. But he seems also to claim for it a quality of authenticitypartly by way of soft sepia-tone photography, like the reproductions in old photo-journalismthat it never earns. The pseudo-documentary style of ""John Reed"" isn't a style at all, but rather an affectation hopefully overlaid upon a flaccid, didactic, fairly conventional treatment of political biography.Shinsuke Ogawa's ""The Peasants of the Second Fortress"" really is documentary, 2 hours of it, dealing with a 1971 struggle by farmers to stop the construction of a Tokyo airport on their land. The movie has a characteristic look, the look of the wet gray spring during which it was filmed, and it is sometimes very beautiful. More often it is dull.Ogawa's uncanny selectivity in photographing the actual combat between peasants and riot police (like a medieval battle staged by Kurosawa at his best) contrasts with his seemingly total indulgence of every random conference among the peasants, to produce a movie that appears always at odds with itself.Because it uses big stars, and because it is the most ambitiously imaginative, I suppose place of honor should go to Claude Faraldo's ""Themroc,"" though I do not much like it as a movie. Themroc, a Parisian laborer, gets bounced from his job one day. He goes home, seals off his room in his mother's apartment, breaks open the outer wall, and begins living like a happy caveman, making ardent love with his kid sister and feeding himself on roast policeman, captured during nighttime raids in the city streets.There is much more to the movie than this, but not enough to hide the earnest propagandizing behind its fantasywhich, for all its daring, might have come from a Stanley Kramer slightly high on pot. But the real pleasure comes from the performances. In ""Themroc"" some speak a nonsense language, while everyone else merely makes noises or acts in mimeand it is fun to watch Michel Piccoli, so often the fastidious hero of boulevard romances, cope with a role in which he can only grunt and groan, and to see Batrice Romand, the extra-articulate teen-ager of ""Claire's Knee,"" as the kid sister, a part that enforces total silence. In fact they both do very well.One further film, ""Kodou,"" by the Senegalese director Ababacar Samb, arrived in an unsubtitled print. Because I do not understand its language, I do not think it proper to review it at this time.",1973-04-11T05:00:00+0000

It's June, and Hermie, Oscy and Benjie, the three friends of Robert Mulligan's ""Summer of '42,"" are graduating from their Brooklyn high school to face not the terrors of a world at war but those of a sequel gone suddenly, hopelessly flat.The only things worth attention in ""Class of '44"" are the period detailsthe cars, the billboards, the haircuts, the songs, the suits and dresses and shoes, all soberly researched and reconstructed as if they were artifacts for Colonial Williamsburg. But because nothing much happens with these props, ""Class of '44"" seems less like a movie than 95 minutes of animated wallpaper.The new film takes Hermie (Gary Grimes) and Oscy (Jerry Houser) to college (Benjie joins the Marines), where Hermie falls in love while Oscy provides the comic relief by, among other things, installing the town whore in his fraternity house for one busy night. The boys have intimations of mortality, and there are jokes about making out, but ""Class of '44"" has about as much relation to what growing up was like then (and may still be now) as did the Henry Aldrich radio series of that period.The screenplay is by Herman Raucher, who also wrote ""Summer of '42."" Those were the good old days,"" I assume we're supposed to say, but the good old days in ""Class of '44"" seem incredibly unimportant and Hermie and Oscy essential clods, fellows who've most likely grown up to be legendary bores on their respective Thursday night bowling teams.Paul Bogart directed the film, which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater.",1973-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,2 Drifters on a Photogenic Landscape:The Cast,"Max and Lion (full name: Francis Lionel) are classic drifters. Cut loose from their lower-middle-class backgrounds, for various, probably neurotic reasons, they float across the face of America with all of the resolution of a couple of cheerful mongrels checking out the bushes, trees and lampposts on any new street that happens to cross their field of limited vision.They never quite get where they're going, which, I suspect, seems more poetic and tragic to the makers of a movie like ""Scarecrow"" than it does to the Maxes and Lions of real life. It's the moving around, not the getting anywhere, that counts.For most of ""Scarecrow""for as long as the movie doesn't intrude on their essential aimlessness  Max (Gene Hackman) and Lion (Al Pacino) are two marvelously realized characters.Max, a big, near-sighted clown with a bad temper, has just finished an extended stay in San Quentin for assault. He's always a bit cold, which is why he wears a half-dozen layers of long johns, shirts and sweaters. He wants to open a carwash in Pittsburghnot because he knows Pittsburgh but because that is where his savings account happens to be.Max is not without a kind of sloppy sex appeal. When he enters a cocktail lounge, a female barfly named Darlene issues an invitation by screaming: ""Shut the door, you big dope! You're letting all the smoke out!""Max neither loves nor trusts anyone until he meets Lion, an ex-seaman hitching his way from California to Detroit to see the wife he deserted six years before and a 5-year-old child who may be either a boy or a girl. He doesn't knowwhich is why the present he carries is a lamp. A lamp, he figures, is a suitable way to avoid the issue.The friendship of Max and Lion, as they lurch across the United States, with time out for a visit with Max's sister Coley (Dorothy Tristan) in Denver (as well as for a month's stay on a Denver Honor Farm), is genuinely moving and funny. It all goes decisively wrong when Jerry Schatzberg, the director, and Garry Michael White, who wrote the screenplay, decide to saddle the pair with a poetic vision that suddenly makes everything needlessly phony.This doesn't come as a complete surprise. There have been hints earlier in the picture that Schatzberg and White want to impose their own sensibilities on Max and Lion. The hints are in the title (Max and Lion and all of the other drifters are life's scarecrows) and in the spectacularly beautiful landscapes, photographed, by Vilmos Zsigmond, through which Max and Lionel move, unaware (though we aren't) that they are in the world as it might be seen by Peter Hurd. No amount of time and no expenses have been spared to obtain the right light.The hints are also there in the supporting performances, which aren't bad, just too busy. There is a definite limit on the number of nose-wipings on sleeves, speeches said with mouths full and elegant burps that any movie can contain before it begins to turn back on itself, like parody. Which is too bad because both Hackman and Pacino are fine and so many of the early, character-setting scenes are so accurate.I assume that Schatzberg and White wanted somehow to ennoble Max and Lionel, but they sentimentalize them in ways rigidly avoided by both John Huston's ""Fat City"" and Barbara Loden's ""Wanda,"" two other films about a similar kind of sad, almost national witlessness. ""Scarecrow"" opened yesterday at the Cinema I.",1973-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Book of Numbers':St. Jacques Focuses on Southern Town The Cast,"For reasons I can only guess at, ""Book of Numbers"" seems a lovely title for a movie. And neither the title, nor its quality, is wasted on Raymond St. Jacques's film about the adventures of two benevolent entrepreneurs who bring the numbers game to the grateful black population of El Dorado, Ark., sometime in the nineteen-thirties.Before their story is over, the younger man finds a sense of purpose and a marvelous girl, the older finds the means to an act of heroism he had never imagined, and El Dorado finds a whole new interest in such simple pleasures as learning the number of the hymn the pastor wants them to sing in church on Sunday.This is a lot to expect from the numbers game, and ""Book of Numbers"" doesn't expect it with too much seriousness. The film has all the standard accouterments of crime melodrama, including real danger and real death. But its spirit comes mainly from its musicbackground music, blues and spirituals, dance tunesrather than from the requirements of melodramatic plotting. That may be why it moves with such efficiency and agility (there is almost nothing wasted in its mere 80 minutes of running time), why it spends no energy on examining profundities where none exist, why the faults of some parts never really threaten the success of the whole.I don't mean to make ""Book of Numbers"" sound like a perfect movie, which it surely isn't. But it does seem an uncommonly well-balanced movie, intelligently directed, very cleverly edited (by Irv Rosenblum), with an air of real enjoyment in what it is about.The characters are all stereotypes of greater or lesser intricacy  which is what they ought to be. The situations are fairly predictable, though no less exciting for all that. And life itself, as the movie sees it, is just enough show-biz so that cardboard characters can run through it as it were on railroad tracksand still maintain the illusion of exceptional grace and freedom.The cast, headed by Mr. St. Jacques (the numbers chief), Philip Thomas (his protg), and Freda Payne (the girl) is expert and very attractive. Sometimes they seem to be having more fun with their material than the screenplay strictly allowsan agreeable kind of excess. In a supporting role, Hope Clarke plays a knowing charmer with the wonderful name of Pigmeat Goins and she is so outrageously good that if I had to see the movie again, she would be reason enough.""Book of Numbers"" opened yesterday at the DeMille Theater.",1973-04-12T05:00:00+0000

The significance of his subtle humor at lunch today was that the captain of the New York Rangers was acting like himself. One reason was that last night he had scored the winning goal in a 41 victory over the Chicago Black Hawks in the opener of their Stanley Cup semifinal series. The goal represented a private drama. For the last six weeks, ever since he was struck in the face by a puck on Feb. 28, he has been living and playing in the drumming daze of a concussion. With every body check, his headaches pounded louder. His wife and children were aware of its effects. So were his coach and teammates. But spectators didn't understand what he was going through. Quickly, most of them had forgotten about his concussion. When they saw him on the ice, they assumed that he must be all right. Often he wasn't.

us,Parties to Hold Talks:The Cast,"Costa-Gavras's ""State of Siege"" is a riveting film and possibly an inflammatory one. It oversimplifies recent history, but raises so many complex and important moral questions that to attack it for oversimplification may be just a discreet form of rationalization, of looking the other way.The screenplay by Franco Solinas, who wrote ""The Battle of Algiers,"" is based on the kidnap and murder of Dan. A. Mitrione in August, 1970, in Montevideo, Uruguay. Mr. Mitrione, an Italian-born American, the father of nine children and a former police chief in Richmond, Ind., was an official of the United States Agency for International Development assigned as an adviser to the Uruguayan police. Officially he was an expert in traffic control and communications, and in this capacity he had earlier been an adviser to the police in Brazil and the Dominican Republic.On July 31, 1970, Mr. Mitrione and the Brazilian consul in Montevideo were kidnapped by the Tupamaros, a group of Marxist-oriented, urban guerrillas who demanded the release of 150 political prisoners. The Uruguayan Government declined, and 10 days after his kidnapping, Mr. Mitrione was executed by the Tupamaros who, until then, had mostly refrained from violence in their efforts to discredit the Government and what they called its repressionist policies.Much of the world was appalled, as it was by the Black September massacre at the Tel Aviv Airport, by the killing of the Israeli athletes in Munich and by the more recent murders in Khartoum.After Mr. Mitrione's murder, information began to be published here and abroad that suggested that Mr. Mitrione's specialty was not necessarily traffic control and communication, but internal security, more specifically, antiguerrilla warfare, with close associations to those responsible for the systematic torture and liquidation of the revolutionary opposition.Among the many questions raised by ""State of Siege"" is one relating to the film maker's responsibility to stick to the truth of an event even when it might be inconvenient. The Solinas screenplay changes the names of the principals (I suppose releases would be hard to get from those alive) and only indirectly alludes to the Uruguayan setting (the film was actually shot in Salvador Allende's Chile). It very carefully never puts the Mitrione character (named Philip Michael Santore in the film and played by Yves Montand) at the scene of any tortures, but the inference  very loud and very clear  is that Mitrione-Santore was a major architect of those policies.Thus to the extent that Costa-Gavras and Solinas suggest that the A.I.D. man was secretly involved in the internal affairs of a foreign government, the film is a rationalization of a terrorist act. However, in its biased but elegantly cool way, it's much more than that. It's an examination of an event first, then of national policies that led to that event (including the United States' historical role as Big Daddy in Latin America through economic programs that help others to help themselves as well as our industry), and lines of responsibility.Finally, it's an examination of our capacity to be shocked, a capacity that may have begun to run out with the disclosures about the Bay of Pigs, so that now, when we read the stories about the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and Chile, we are as much inclined to laughter as we are to grief or even to surprise. We shrug and ask ourselves, in effect, what will they do next? Self-interest carried to the limit is no longer evil, or a matter for review by one's conscience, but a kind of dumbfounding rascality, a high form of scalawaggery.What makes ""State of Siege"" so harrowing is not that it is all true (I'm not in a position to know), but that it could be true, and all of us could be responsible. This is more important, I think, than carping over details of the film, over the fact that no effort is made to define the inflationary economic conditions in Uruguay that first prompted the press censorship and other repressive measures that, in turn prompted the revolutionary opposition.Strictly as an example of film-making, ""State of Siege"" is exceptionally shrewd. Although we have no doubt what the outcome of the narrative will be, Costa-Gavras and Solinas maintain our interest at what is sometimes called (in admitted desperation) a fever pitch. Through the kind of rapid cross-cutting made familiar in both ""Z"" and ""The Confession,"" they manage to make straight exposition hugely dramatic.Will or won't the police find the kidnapped officials? Cut to the Uruguayan legislature where a report is being read concerning the existence of ""an uncontrollable and autonomous organization"" within the national police. Cut to the rebels' interrogation of Montand, cut to . . . cut to. . . . The movie's pace is unrelenting, and it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I recognized the essential monotony of the techniques.Most shrewd is the casting of Montand, who, because he is Montand, evokes sympathy for a character who remains at best sincerely wrongheaded, at worst a fuzzy villain. Were this American played by an American actor, the film might well be insupportably antagonizing.""State of Siege,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman, also raises the question about what the American Film Institute was up to when it first booked the film to open its new Washington theater at the Kennedy Center. It should have been apparent to anyone who had seen it that ""State of Siege"" would ruffle a lot of people in Washington, but then to cancel it, as was done last week, suggests incompetence of an order as scary as outright censorship.",1973-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:'How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman',"Anybody confronting a film with a title like ""How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman"" has a right to know what it is about. Well, it happens to be about eating a Frenchmanthough that's not all. And even that isn't quite the simple gastronomic thrill the average moviegoer may have come to expect from his celluloid cannibalism.In the coastal wilds of 16th-century Brazil, a French soldier (Arduino Colasanti) escapes his officersonly to be captured first by the Portuguese and then by a tribe of man-eating Indians. Mistaking him for one of their mortal enemies, the Portuguese, the Indians decide to kill him for his crimes and then to eat him for his powers. But first he is given a long period of relative privilege, enjoying a young Indian wife (Ana Maria Magalhaes) and counseling the tribal chief (Ital Natur). This period is the central concern of the film.But it is not the only concern. ""How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman"" means to be a meditation on the past and perhaps the future of Brazilironic, often comicand it mixes fictional drama with allusions to economic, social and religious history. In portraying its Indians, it exercises great care (there is an elaborate Indian village, which looks for all the world like a superb, animated textbook reconstruction), and if they sometimes suggest too much the noble savage, they at least represent an attempt at verisimilitude.The verisimilitude, of course, is something of a joke. The Indians are middle-class white Brazilians (ordinary men and exceptionally beautiful young women) stripped down and reddened up for the occasion. ""How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman"" is the first absolutely non-exploitative (not nonerotic) movie I have seen to require almost total nudity from its cast, both sexes. Everyone is very convincing, but not always so convincing as to dissociate daily life in a 16th-century Indian village from just having an awfully good time.But in the last analysis the film isn't all that funny, and it doesn't really mean to be. A very uneven work, its best passages are among its most seriousespecially one sequence near the end, when the Indian wife describes for her captive husband the ritual that is to be his death. Half-dancing, sometimes smiling, sometimes almost crying, she re-creates on a barren placea huge rock by the seashoreall the elements and emotions of a complex and fateful drama. It is a lovely performance, and, in its respect for space and movement, it seems very close to the spirit of classic cinema.""How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman,"" which was directed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos, opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.",1973-04-17T05:00:00+0000

But then I think it fair to ask where have you been hiding yourself for the last 10 years, as spy melodramas have come and gone, and double agents have multiplied, selling their secrets but saving their soulsfor whatever tragic, trendy, ironic fate awaits them at the end of the sordid alley-way that the rest of us call life.Set in Vienna, Paris suburban Georgetown and other fleshpots of the world, ""Scorpio"" pits C.I.A. agent Cross (Burt Lancaster) against his boss McLeod (John Colicos), while between them stands Laurier (Alain Delon), hired assassin, the Scorpio of the title, hired by McLeod to kill Crosswho happens to be the closest thing he ever had to a best friend, and who also taught him everything he knows about the hired-assassination business.What Cross wants to do is go off and relax with his wife Sarah (Joanne Linville), and what Laurier wants to do is go off and relax with his girl Susan (Gayle Hunnicuttin this movie all the men have only last names and the women have only first names). But there remains the problem of the contract on Cross's life, and why it is there. The situation sounds like elemental anguish, except that in ""Scorpio"" nobody stops long enough to feel anguishand so it all becomes merely elemental, or elementary, if your critical facilities are so disposed.The dialogue consists mainly of aphorisms. Actually, the aphorisms come only from Cross and from Zharkov (Paul Scofield), Cross's Russian counterpart and a pal from the old days when we could all be anti-Fascists together. Everybody else gets told what to think. But the aphoristic style, combined with Winner's unwavering visual instinct for crushingly obvious detail, helps to push ""Scorpio"" out of low dullness into vertiginous absurdity. This is almost enough to save the movie from suffocating in its own clich's.There are people who take Winner seriously (""The Jokers,"" ""Chato's Land,"" ""The Mechanic,"" etc.), but I doubt if anyone could take ""Scorpio"" seriously, and that is the best I can say about it. Sitting in the theater, begrudging every minute and yet slightly hoping it would not end, I am caught in the moviegoer's age-old agony, between heart felt derision and guilty delight.""Scorpio"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.",1973-04-19T05:00:00+0000

There is a type of novel that seems to be terribly random, that reads as if it had been written simplybecause the author could not endure another moment of having nothing to do and had fastened on the first subject that came to mind.

us,'High Plains Drifter' Opens on Screen,"Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) is indignant. Having so successfully caught the eye of The Stranger (Clint Eastwood) that he has carried her into the livery stable and had his way with her (with her cooperation), she complains to the sheriff: ""Isn't forcible rape in broad daylight still a misdemeanor in this town?""It is not, and has not been for some time, not since the good citizens of the little frontier community of Lago banded together to murder their former sheriff, an honorable man who had wanted to reveal that the town's mining company was on Government land.""High Plains Drifter,"" with Eastwood as director as well as star, is part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you have lost your good sense. The violence of the film (including a couple of murders by bull-whipping) is continual and explicit. It exalts and delights in a kind of pitiless Old Testament wrath.However, it is also apparent that neither Ernest Tidyman, who wrote the screenplay, nor Eastwood are taking themselves too seriously. Eastwood's characterization of The Stranger, who settles God's score with Lago, is a high parody of the soft-featured, brutal Man With No Name he played in those bitter Sergio Leone Westerns. Tidyman's dialogue is funny, and the physical settingsome weatherbeaten shacks on the edge of a body of water that looks like a dead seais startlingly beautiful.Eastman, who earlier directed ""Play Misty for Me,"" has also surrounded himself with a group of good supporting actors, including Verna Bloom, Mitchell Ryan and a 65-year-old midget named Billy Curtis.",1973-04-20T05:00:00+0000
us,Fun of 'Love and Pain' Yields to Ethic,"""Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing,"" directed by Alan J. Pakula and written by Alvin Sargent, is most of the time such a funny and eccentric romantic comedy that you have to excuse the attack of Anglo-Saxon ethic that finally overwhelms it.Despite almost everything written by Colette, despite the experience of even Benjamin Franklin, popular American and English fiction writers persist in spreading the gloomy word that the conjoining of an older woman and a younger man is a near-mortal sin, usually punishable by death. It may not be so in life (Mary Pickford and Buddy Rogers made a go of it), but the audiences for which Hollywood thinks it is making its films (if not the film makers themselves) are afraid to believe otherwise.This is what's wrong with ""Love and Pain,"" which is about the thoroughly revivifying love affair of an English spinster in her late 30's, Lila Fisher, who's supposed to be plain, although she is played by the spectacularly engaging Maggie Smith, and a troubled, asthmatic American college boy, Walter Elbertson (Timothy Bottoms). The setting is Spain, which, in summer, becomes a giant, open-air museum and parkland to be overrun with organized tours by bus and bicycle.Their meeting is not auspicious. Walter, taking the seat next to Lila on a bus, inadvertently squirts her with his breath-freshener and then allows her to sit on his Mounds barbut they both seem to be neurotic messes at the start.Lila is running away from Bournemouth, where she lives with two elderly aunts and lodgers who must be propped up in their baths and who misplace their teeth in the piano. Walter's background is also forbidding. His father has won a Pulitzer Prize for a book called ""The Identity of Man,"" and his sister can build her own cellos.Lila and Walter are clearly made for each other, and the film is charming so long as it focuses on the details of their growing love and need for each other. Miss Smith, who was so fine in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and somehow completely out of step with ""Travels With My Aunt,"" is again magnificent (and magnificently funny), whether locked in a ladies room and crying out a dainty, plaintive ""por favor"" (read from a phrase book), or putting off an ardent Spaniard, who tries to seduce her with bird-calls. ""I'm not too familiar with birds,"" she says with a mixture of hautiness and desperation. ""I have a fish.""Mr. Bottoms, the hero of ""The Last Picture Show,"" is equally funny and believable, full of wonder at the intensity of purpose (and intensity of clichs) that Lila awakens in him. It is something of a breakthrough for him when he finds himself saying, quite seriously: ""We have to smile in the rain and be cheerful losers.""""Love and Pain"" was photographed in front of, around and through somewhat more scenery than is absolutely necessary, and it eventually goes to soap suds, but that happens late. In the meantime, you can enjoy two of the most intelligently comic performances of the year so far.",1973-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Soylent Green',"New Yorkers certainly have problems these daysgraffiti, income tax, the Yankees  but nothing like the horrors due in 2022 as depicted in ""Soylent Green,"" which arrived at local theaters yesterday. To begin with, the Gotham of 2022 teems with 40-million citizens; overpopulation and its concomitant horrors aside, the erosion of the environment is such that there's little to eat other than ""Soylent Green"" which, we're told, is synthesized from plankton. Unfortunately, the script, direction and the principals involved in this struggle for survival often are as synthetic as ""Soylent Green.""There is, of course, every reason to view the next century with some fear. But ""Soylent Green"" projects essentially simple, muscular melodrama a good deal more effectively than it does the potential of man's seemingly witless destruction of the earth's resources.Charlton Heston, as a harried detective investigating the murder of Joseph Cotten, a bigwig in the dictatorial Soylent Company (whom we see only fleetingly), is aided by the late Edward G. Robinson in his last role as an aged, wise, suspicious researcher, who remembers the good old days of steaks and the like. And, finally exposed by a bewildering succession of hungry citizens, overcrowded streets, fancy pads and the resident, luscious lasses (called ""furniture"" here) of the rich few, is the awful truth about the secret ingredient of ""Soylent Green.""We won't reveal that ingredient but it must be noted that Richard Fleischer's direction stresses action, not nuances of meaning or characterization. Mr. Robinson is pitiably natural as the realistic, sensitive oldster facing the futility of living in dying surroundings. But Mr. Heston is simply a rough cop chasing standard bad guys.Their 21st-century New York occasionally is frightening but it is rarely convincingly real.",1973-04-20T05:00:00+0000

Soaring lumber prices as well as the scarcity of some woods, such as the cedar planking that sheathes the house, account for most of the increase. To stay within his original budget, Moger had designed in many economical features and acted as his own general contractor. The house smaller than one thinks, only 1,500 square feet. The open plan, which eliminates most interior walls and circulation areas, and the generous deck reaching out from the living and dining areas give a sensation of space.

us,Screen: 'To Be Free',"""To Be Free"" is a very bad, very self-indulgent first feature written, directed and produced by Ned Bosnick, a native of Pittsburgh who is reported to have studied film at the University of California at Los Angeles under the great Jean Renoir.It's a humorless psychological fantasy about a girl named Carole (Barbara Douglas), a sort of pretty Barbra Streisand type, who goes to see a psychiatrist because she can't enjoy sex with her fianc, Bruce, although Bruce has, in Carole's words, ""unlocked my love balloon."" Thinking that Carole may be afraid of pregnancy, the doctor suggests birth control.

Rosenberg do little to enhance the creepy legend or spooked stately mansion movie genre with ""And Now the Screaming Starts."" Their latest consignment from Britain, which landed at the Juliet 2 and Forum Theaters yesterday, may have a few shocks, but they're not enough to overcome a padded plot and the mounting feeling that the screaming is being done for the wrong reasons.Stephanie Beacham, as the pretty, full-bosomed but timorous 18th-century bride of Ian Ogilvy, the handsome lord of Fengriffen manor, tips the bloody mitt at the start when she observes that the house ""filled my nights with horror."" And before you can say ""Long live the King!"" the screen is filled with dire implications, bloody-eyed specters at the windows, a crawling, severed hand and five corpses, to send our now-pregnant heroine screaming out of her wits.It's not ungallant to note that Herbert Lom, as the late grandfather of the bridegroom, was the dissolute baronet who brought the curse down on the Fengriffens when he violated a local woodsman's bride and lopped off the hand of the frenzied bridegroom, who then puts the hex on future Fengriffens.Miss Beacham is decorative even when screaming. Ian Ogilvy, as her worried husband, Patrick Magee, as the family's kindly doctor, Geoffrey Whitehead, as the woodsman's strange grandson, and Guy Rolfe and Rosalie Crutchley, as Fengriffen retainers, are simply dour or frightened as they stretch the mystery.Peter Cushing, however, adds a singular bright note to the dark proceedings directed in somber, largely measured style by Roy Ward Baker. He has apparently beaten Dr. Freud by about a century as the genteel specialist in the ""distress of the mind"" called in to aid our obviously distressed heroine. As the script says a good deal of ""torment is caused by the written word, not fact.""",1973-04-28T05:00:00+0000

There is a reliance on classic, triedandtrue fabrics, which can no longer be dismissed as mere nostalgia. The revived popularity of madras, seersucker, cotton and chambray is due, above all, to their good looks and proven performance. Even colors have cooled it. While redwhiteandblue is still the favorite warm weather combination, white has left that everpopular trio and this summer solos most impressivelythe season's freshestlooking suits are frosty whiteand, with black, provides an elegant alliance in everything from shirts to shoes. In sportswear, softer tones have superseded yesterday's cartoon colors: even the ice cream shades are more Louis Sherry than BaskinRobbins. The sense of fun, has not fled, however.

us,' Wedding in White' Views 40's Family:The Cast,"William Fruet's ""Wedding in White"" is a good, tough, clear-eyed Canadian film about a working-class family and the sweet, dim-witted, 16-year-old daughter, Jeannie, who finds herself ""in trouble"" (the euphemism she favors) after a singularly quick and joyless seduction by her brother's best friend.The time is midway through World War II, when being in trouble meant instant disgrace, especially to a father like Jeannie's, a hard-working, hard-drinking, narrow-minded man who would say that boys will be boys but that the girls who do are whores. His solution: marry Jeannie off to his best friend Sandy, a robust Scot of about 60 who is a drunk.""Wedding in White"" is the sort of domestic drama that most playwrights and film makers botch, either because they determinedly explain away the characters as sociological phenomena, as in another Canadian film, ""Go-in"" Down the Road,"" or because they invest the characters with inclinations to doggedly banal self-analysis. People in plays like Robert Anderson's ""I Never Sang for My Father"" and Frank Gilroy's ""The Subject Was Roses"" tend to talk about themselves as if they were not there, and to conceptualize problems that in life, arguing by the kitchen sink, remain specific.Mr. Fruet, who wrote the screenplay for ""Goin' Down the Road,"" directed ""Wedding in White"" and adapted the script from his stage play. The dialogue is so faultless that even the slang defines the era as much as the skirt lengths and the automobiles. ""My dad would crown me if I did that,"" Jeannie says at one point. More important, never does the writer-director allow his characters to talk above their station, to describe the overview that we in the audience can see for ourselves.""Wedding in White"" is not really tragic, nor is it as bleak as it might sound. It is a closely observed chronicle of one family's life, moving and funny and a little scary, full of unexpected stoicism and the kind of boozy jocularity that can suddenly erupt into violence. It is also marvelously well acted.Donald Pleasence is Jeannie's dad, ""a top-notch bowler and a triple-threat man at darts,"" who also manages to suggest the existence of evil in the most commonplace of personalities. Jeannie's mother is played by Doris Petrie, a Canadian actress of unaffected beauty and great discretion of gesture. Also, fine are Paul Bradley and Doug McGrath (the born losers of ""Goin' Down the Road""), as, respectively, the soldier son and the best friend who so casually gets Jeannie into trouble.At the center of the film, looking oddly like a Jan van Eyck subject transplanted to a land of five-and-tens and drug stores, is Carol Kane, whose Jeannie is someone obviously destined to go through life with nothing ever fitting.When her father brings home a second-hand dress for her to wear to the wedding she doesn't want, Jeannie's first thought is to call her friend Dollie, as if she had just received a birthday present. The world, the passions of others, her clothes, even her masses of frizzy reddish hair, are too big for her, and her brain is too small.""Wedding in White"" opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie.",1973-04-30T05:00:00+0000
