Analysts said the move was an apparent attempt to assure investors that relations have improved between the brothers and to shore up the stock prices of the companies in the Reliance group, India's largest industrial conglomerate. Shares of Reliance Industries fell about 10 percent and Reliance Energy fell by about 15 percent after the conflict became known two weeks ago. The directors resigned on Thursday but Reliance Energy did not say why. The brothers, Mukesh Ambani, 47, and Anil Ambani, 45, appear to be struggling to control the Reliance empire, which was founded by their father, Dhirubhai, who died two years ago without leaving a will.

The government's statistics agency said that gross domestic product expanded 6.1 percent from July through September compared with the year-earlier period. The most recent performance was the fastest growth rate for the quarter since 1996. When compared with the second quarter, however, the economy grew a more modest 1 percent, slightly below most forecasts. All sectors of the economy expanded in the quarter, with exports soaring 18.2 percent from a year ago and industrial output rising 7 percent. Household consumption, meanwhile, rose 5.7 percent, the biggest increase since 1997. Brazil's economy, South America's largest, is expected to grow 4.66 percent this year. But growth is expected to slow to about 3.5 percent in 2005 as a recent increase in interest rates threatens to weigh on the economy. The government also revised last year's growth numbers, saying the economy expanded 0.54 percent in 2003 instead of shrinking 0.2 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)",2004-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Mr. McDonagh, the 34-year-old English playwright known for such savage -- and often savagely funny -- plays as ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane"" and ""The Lonesome West,"" is to return to Broadway next spring with ""The Pillowman,"" a drama (with laughs) about the interrogation of a writer in an unnamed totalitarian state. (You're giggling already, right?) The play opened to nearly unanimous raves at the Royal National Theater in London last November and later won a 2004 Olivier Award, Britain's highest theater prize, for best play. Supporting Mr. McDonagh in the American effort is the producing team of Robert Fox, Bob Boyett and Bill Haber and a cast that includes Billy Crudup as the writer and Jeff Goldblum as his inquisitor. Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg complete the cast for the production, which is to open on April 10 at the Booth Theater. John Crowley will direct. JESSE McKINLEY",2004-12-01T05:00:00+0000

The Flemish master, it turned out, revised the painting some 20 years after he first executed it, in 1609, adding a self-portrait and changing the Virgin's posture. The discovery prompted the museum to organize an exhibition, which opened yesterday, on the evolution of Rubens's style. The show features a radiographic study showing how the painting looked before Rubens's revisions and has original sketches and an anonymous copy of the 1609 version. The most significant changes in the painting were made to the Virgin, whose beauty ""is more natural and more modest in the definitive version,"" said the exhibition's curator, Alejandro Vergara. Her cloak was also transformed from a soft pink to a bolder red and blue. Rubens revised the painting during his second trip to Spain, from 1628 to 1629. The exhibition runs through Feb. 27.

After the publication of ""In Cold Blood"" in 1966, Capote decided not to return to the apartment and told the landlord that he was abandoning any possessions there. The box was rescued by the housesitter, whose relative has now consigned several manuscripts for sale.

The increase was the 10th consecutive monthly gain, and it pushed the unemployment rate up to 10.3 percent, the Federal Labor Agency said. The agency's chairman, Frank-Jrgen Weise, said the rate of increase had slowed as a result of labor market reform measures, but the economy was still too weak for the job market to turn around.

There's been plenty of din. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ousted a coalition partner, the secular Shinui Party, and is cozying back up to Shimon Peres and the Labor Party, a move that will further alienate Likud hard-liners like Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, a fiery and charismatic leader of the uprising, Marwan Barghouti, has thrown the Palestinian Authority into a tizzy over his last-minute declaration of his candidacy for president. How Mr. Barghouti would govern from prison, where he is serving five life terms on terrorism convictions, is questionable, to say the least.",2004-12-03T05:00:00+0000
us,"Arts, Briefly; High Season for Russian Art in London Auctions","There was a feeding frenzy for Russian art at London auction houses this week, with at least $40 million in sales through Wednesday of more than 1,000 lots. Many items were sold to Russian collectors hungry for works that were taken from the country after the Russian Revolution. Christie's said that it set a record for the sale of a 19th-century Russian painting, with two works that each exceeded 1 million (about $1.9 million): ""Study of a Family Portrait"" by Ilya Repin, and ""St. Isaac's on a Frosty Day,"" above, by Ivan Aivazovsky. The new breed of collectors first gained a reputation for deep-pocketed boldness in February when the industrialist Viktor Vekselberg pre-empted Sotheby's auction of Malcolm Forbes's Faberg collection by buying his entire collection for more than $90 million. Christie's two Russian auctions on Tuesday totaled nearly $23 million. The auctions continued at Sotheby's on Wednesday and Thursday, with paintings, Faberg objects, books and other items; Wednesday's sales alone came to more than $17.6 million. A newly opened auction house devoted to Russian art, MacDougall's, also had sales this week. SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY",2004-12-03T05:00:00+0000

us,'STAGING HAPPINESS',"After Stalin came to power in 1924, Soviet spinmeisters began to have a field day with make-believe. Their job was to convince humanity that production hummed at farms and factories; that worker morale was high; that the Soviet Army was invincible; in short, that the Soviet Union was the best of all possible worlds. An effective means of making fiction look like fact was photography, already a medium that had been used by avant-garde artists for their own aesthetic purposes. Now it was being manipulated to serve the government's as well. There were plenty of talented photographers to call on, among them the great Aleksandr Rodchenko. This show of more than 30 Soviet propaganda photographs, mostly from the 1930's, gives a good account of how photographic subjects were stage-managed by lensmen themselves, or adjusted later, by retouching, montaging, overpainting and airbrushing, all in the cause of glorifying the Soviet enterprise. The well-selected, heroic-looking soldiers of ""An Oath, Red Square, Moscow"" (1936), above, by Rodchenko, are tightly ranked under a banner proclaiming ""Workers of the World Unite!"" Arkady Shaiket's heroic image of a parachutist, Katya Melnikov (1934), in the cockpit of her plane glamorizes the new Soviet Woman. Smiling workers! Stalwart soldiers! Devoted families! Intrepid athletes! And a fearless, benign father uniting them. These are some of the carefully contrived images that make this show a tribute to the talent of Soviet photographers even as it reveals their complicity in Stalin's big lie.(Nailya Alexander Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, through Dec. 30; free.)

In total, Nissan may be forced to reduce its production by as many as 40,000 vehicles because of the tight steel supplies, a loss that would reduce the company's profit by as much as 16 billion yen ($155 million), Mr. Ghosn said. Nissan has not been able to get enough steel because of higher-than-expected sales of some of its cars and because strong demand in China has left many steel makers with little capacity to raise output. Mr. Ghosn predicted that other Japanese automakers might also face shortages in March, typically the peak month for auto production in Japan. Todd Zaun (NYT)",2004-12-03T05:00:00+0000

Last year, about 33,000 of the state's 3.4 million residents were homeless, including 13,000 children, the group said. In 2003, people were turned away from state shelters 37,500 times, an increase of 38 percent from 2002, said the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, a nonprofit group.

In October Isis released an engrossing new CD, ""Panopticon"" (Ipecac), featuring seven of the band's subtlest compositions so far. The sounds never stop swelling and fading and shapeshifting, but somehow, the mood stays almost supernaturally constant: the loudest passages feel profoundly peaceful, and the quietest passages feel secretly furious. Also on the bill: Tim Hecker, an equally subtle Montreal-based electronic producer who has (for the moment) abandoned rhythmic tracks to focus on texture. Last year, he released ""Radio Amor"" (Mille Plateaux), a disc united by disintegrating piano chords, inspired by an encounter with a Honduran shrimp-boat captain named Jimmy. This fall he released ""Mirage"" (www.alien8recordsings.com), full of sublime shards and sumptuous whispers: sounds of ardor and terror, broadcast across some unbridgeable chasm.

John Meehan, the Studio Company's artistic director, said in a recent interview that about half of Ballet Theater's present dancers have come from the Studio, including such prominent performers as Herman Cornejo, Michele Wiles, David Hallberg, Misty Copeland, Sascha Radetzky, Craig Salstein and Kristi Boone. This weekend the troupe is staging two premieres and two older pieces. Both premieres are by Texas-based choreographers almost totally unknown in New York. Mr. Meehan unhesitatingly called Stephen Mills, the artistic director of Ballet Austin, ""a really underappreciated choreographer."" He will be represented by ""Hush,"" a flowing work to music by Philip Glass. Dominic Walsh, a former Houston Ballet dancer who now heads his own Dominic Walsh Dance Theater, will offer ""Alchemy,"" to a score collaboratively composed by Two Star Symphony, the string quartet that will play it live. Mr. Meehan said the ballet concerns a man facing his thoughts and feelings in encounters that are sometimes comforting and sometimes ""a little abrasive."" The program's older works are showpieces: Anton Dolin's all-male ""Variations for Four"" (1978) and Arthur Saint-Lon's sparkling pas de six from ""La Vivandire"" (1844).

The Justice Department had sought the order on behalf of the Department of Energy, which contends that the initiative, approved overwhelmingly by voters last month, violated laws giving federal, rather than state, authorities power over the shipment and disposal of nuclear waste. The judge, Alan A. McDonald of Federal District Court, said the order was needed to allow the Hanford cleanup to continue while the issue was pending in court.

The next day, when the boy vomited and stopped breathing, Mr. Clark and the mother took him to a hospital. An autopsy showed Isaiah had suffered a fractured skull and a broken rib.

O'BYRNE AND CHERRY JONES,"That men of the cloth are also men of flesh isn't exactly shocking news these days, with headlines regularly touting tales of priests who have found all sorts of ways to break vows of chastity. But the charismatically human Father Flynn -- who is suspected of taking a too ardent interest in a 10-year-old schoolboy in ""Doubt, a Parable,"" the superb new drama by John Patrick Shanley -- is no case study from the tabloids, limned in lurid black and white. As embodied with photographic vividness by Brian F. O'Byrne, Father Flynn is an affable, accessible-seeming fellow, equally skilled at preaching down-to-earth sermons and teaching kids the art of basketball. But when he speaks from the pulpit about the loneliness of ""private calamity,"" you wonder just what shadows darken his own heart. Mr. O'Byrne, who won a Tony for portraying an admitted child killer in ""Frozen,"" here presents an equally compelling study of a man whose innocence or guilt will never be clear to anyone -- possibly, including himself. Mr. O'Byrne is matched to perfection by Cherry Jones as the nun of steel who makes it her personal mission to expose Father Flynn as a pedophile. The friction generated between them gives real fire to the smokey ambiguities of this sharp and subtle play.

Julius, an AJC Honorary Vice President, and his beloved late wife Dorothy were longtime members of the AJC family, serving on our National Board of Governors, National Leadership Council and Horizon Society. In honor of their 50th wedding anniversary in 1993, they endowed AJC's Julius and Dorothy Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations to help build stronger bonds of friendship and understanding between our communities. We were proud to honor Julius with AJC's Avraham Harman Award in 2001. A man of great integrity and gentility, Julius supported, in word and deed, a host of meaningful causes and did so always with a quiet grace and kind heart. His passion for Israel and for the physical, social and spiritual well-being of the Jewish people was boundless. Indeed, he left this world a brighter and more hopeful place than he found it and his legacy of goodness will long be remembered. We send our deepest condolences to his four daughters and their families, and to all who grieve the passing of this extraordinary man. E. Robert Goodkind, Pres. David A. Harris, Exec. Dir.

Who wants to do Napa with a teetotaler or take on Delhi with a companion whose digestion is delicate? Readers rely on travel writers not only for their knowledge of foreign lands but also for their taste and perception, for what they remember and highlight and what they leave out. No matter the destination, a writer's failure to focus on the right vista can spoil the entire expedition. I recall two book-bound excursions to Vietnam, a country where I love to travel, with disagreeable narrators who seemed intent on quashing my enthusiasm.

Stickey's evokes a kitschy, Disney-like country jamboree, with its rustic paneling, corrugated-tin ceiling and craft-fair folk art on the walls. The restaurant is aptly named, as the rolls of paper towels on the tables, along with an ample supply of Wet Naps, portend the shirt-staining meal to come. But unlike the oven-baked ""barbecue"" served at many New Jersey restaurants, Stickey's serves the genuine article.

us,Smashing Posters,"The vibrating colors and illegible typographic lettering of psychedelic concert posters in the late 60's gave us a universal graphic language for the hippie sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll era. Posters were designed to advertise bands, appeal to aficionados and offend everyone else. Hip-capitalist entrepreneurs, however, quickly reduced real psychedelia to a youth-culture style that sold everything from tie-dyed neckties to Volkswagen vans. The coffin was nailed when psychedelic lettering popped up on TV in the logo for ""The Dating Game."" An era was over. What came next, in the 70's, was punk music -- and an anarchic graphic sensibility typified by D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself), a deliberately clumsy hodgepodge of images that were cut and pasted and frequently stolen and photocopied. Punk was known for its ransom-note aesthetic, introduced by Jamie Reid on his record sleeves for the Sex Pistols; this stuff broke the tenets of legibility but telegraphed clear-coded messages to its audience. In the years since, rock posters have come to embrace a wide range of raucous comic styles and typographies -- as well as frequent parodying of, and homages to, pass fashions (including psychedelics) -- intended to convey moods and make statements that are often satirically political.",2004-12-05T05:00:00+0000

The ship's master entered his name in the manifest: Andras Nemet. He was Hungarian, of the Magyar race and the peasant class. He had been born a subject of Franz Josef, emperor of Austria and apostolic king of Hungary, and lived in a place called Raho, a village of several hundred on the Rima River in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.

A number of high-profile CD's this season will be available in both a standard case and in more elaborate, more expensive packages, a marketing ploy usually reserved for rereleases and compilations. ""We want our artists to have the freedom to express themselves in other ways,"" said Steve Berman, head of sales and marketing at Interscope, which is releasing two editions of albums by Ms. Stefani and U2. Fans may appreciate the keepsakes, but record labels are more concerned with offering consumers something they can't get from a download. Will fans find these special editions (which often don't contain any more music than the regular CD) worth the extra money? ""The jury's out on that,"" said Mike Dreese, co-owner of the New England music chain Newbury Comics. As a retailer, though, he likes them -- and not just because his profit per unit is significantly higher. ""Even if one out of every 20 CD's is like that, it keeps in your mind the emotional connection that you don't get from song 11 on your hard drive,"" he said.

Generally, when a famous artist passes away, the price of his or her work skyrockets. So what is happening to the work of these three photographers? Initially their works were selling ""right in estimate, not high, not low,"" said Denise Bethel, the director of photography at Sotheby's in New York. ""I do not think their passing has affected the market"" (which rises slightly at this time of year). Morbidly glamorous frenzies tend to accompany the deaths of younger artists, like Andy Warhol (59) and Jean-Michel Basquiat (27). Markets for the works of Avedon, Cartier Bresson, and Newton had developed during their long lives, their deaths were not particularly shocking and their estates are expected to be well managed, all of which keep prices steady. But all that may be changing, as the clues below indicate. ""Death cannot be factored into the estimate,"" said Joshua Holdeman, an international director of photography at Christie's.

(That week, it was gunned down by a murderers' row of novels that included Erich Segal's ""Love Story"" at No. 1, John Fowles's ""French Lieutenant's Woman"" at No. 2 and James Dickey's ""Deliverance"" at No. 3.) The Corleone family is back on the list this week in Mark Winegardner's book ""The Godfather Returns,"" which makes its debut at No. 7. Winegardner, 43, is a literary novelist who teaches at Florida State University. Like a lot of readers of a certain age, this one included, he first picked up Puzo's ""Godfather"" when he was 11 or 12 because he'd heard it had dirty parts. In a Newsday interview, Winegardner recalled admitting this fact to a friend, the writer Lorrie Moore: ""Without missing a beat, she said, 'Page 27!' Sure enough, Page 27 -- the scene with Sonny Corleone and Lucy Mancini doing it standing up."" Winegardner's book has received generally positive reviews, including the one in this issue, written by Sarah Vowell. Some readers may give Winegardner bonus points for being true to his school.

When ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"" opens on Dec. 17, parents will have an opportunity to decide whether they buy his argument. Based on the first three books in the dark but immensely popular series of novels by Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket, the movie tells the story of the three Baudelaire orphans. After their parents die in a suspicious fire, they are left, unaccountably, in the care of a distant relative, Count Olaf (played in the film by Jim Carrey), who, in varied disguises, tries to bump them off to obtain their fortune. In each book, the other adults in the story are blind to the count's intentions, while the children literally see through his tricks and always manage to outwit him. The dry style of the books speaks to preteens and adolescents. But what's funny on the page -- a baby dangling by a rope from a tower, say -- could be horrifying on screen, at least to the younger set. And while the books are marketed to readers over 10, the film's producers -- Paramount, DreamWorks, and, significantly, Nickelodeon Films -- will surely need to appeal to a wider audience to recoup its $142 million cost.",2004-12-05T05:00:00+0000

The film, released by Walt Disney Studios, was shown in 3,243 theaters. (In the traditionally sluggish week after Thanksgiving, the film's ticket sales dropped 46.7 percent.) Another movie that did not please critics, Sony's ""Christmas With the Kranks,"" starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis, also scored this weekend, reaching No. 2, with sales of $11.7 million in 3,416 theaters, bringing its box-office total to $45.4 million in two weeks.

Sony's Oscar hopeful, ""Closer,"" starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, one of the few adult pictures amid lots of family fare, opened in moderate release with sales of $7.7 million; it was beaten slightly by ""SpongeBob SquarePants,"" which reached $7.8 million in sales.

A three-alarm fire in a three-story house at 976 Decatur Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that erupted around 10:20 a.m. left two families homeless and prompted the evacuation of about 16 people from two adjoining buildings as flames scorched their upper floors. Two women were injured, and one was taken to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where she was treated for smoke inhalation. Eleven firefighters also suffered minor injuries, and three were taken to Kings County Hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but fire officials suspect some foul play, said Tim Hinchey, a department spokesman. Shortly before 7 p.m., a fire broke out in a 26-story apartment building at 555 Kappock Street in the Spuyten Duyvil section of the Bronx, leaving a 66-year-old woman suffering minor injuries from smoke inhalation, Firefighter Hinchey said. She was taken to Jacobi Medical Center. A short while later, five firefighters in Borough Park, Brooklyn, were injured fighting a fire in a two-story building at 4117 14th Avenue. They were taken to Kings County Hospital and Methodist Hospital for treatment.

""This is not about who gets what,"" Michael Stern said yesterday.

The match was to be held in January in Dubai. The federation said in a news release that the sponsor, identified by the federation in an October release as Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, had not provided the financial guarantees necessary to hold the match. The prize fund was to be $1.2 million. The match was part of an effort to reunify the world championship, split since 1993. The winner was to have faced Vladimir Kramnik, the other current world champion. In late October, Mr. Kasparov expressed doubt in a letter to the federation that the match would happen in Dubai because he had not seen any financial guarantees. In the letter, he said the Turkish chess federation was prepared to raise the money and organize the match and urged the federation to accept the offer. In yesterday's announcement, the federation did not mention the Turkish offer but said that it was negotiating with potential sponsors and that the match would occur in the spring.

Hevesi. In the report, Mr. Hevesi said the unexpected education costs, along with potentially higher expenses this year for Medicaid and for overtime pay for police officers and firefighters, could widen the annual gap in the city's budget by about $650 million beginning in the 2006 fiscal year, which starts next July. The city had been forecasting a gap of $3 billion that year. The Bloomberg administration has said that the cost overruns resulted partly from unexpected expenses for special education. Mr. Hevesi said the overruns were also due to accounting problems within the Education Department, which he said the city has pledged to fix. Mike McIntire (NYT)",2004-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Their furniture rarely comes to market, because there is so little of it: the Greenes were obsessive and notoriously slow, meticulously supervising artisans as they inlaid woodwork with semiprecious stones or cut squiggly colored panes for light fixtures. The Sotheby's consignor, an elderly collector on the West Coast, got many of the objects from heirs of the Greenes or of their clients. Estimates range from $300 to $400 for an iron teapot, and from $100,000 to $150,000 for a lantern in mahogany and leaded glass, above. EVE KAHN",2004-12-09T05:00:00+0000

The girls, 14 and 17, confessed to strangling the woman, a neighbor paralyzed in an automobile accident in February, but claimed it was a mercy killing. The woman, they said, asked them to kill her because she suffered intense pain from her injuries. They testified that she offered them gold jewelry as payment if they would end her life. They failed at their first attempt, to inject air into her veins. Eventually, they strangled her with a rope, which the teenagers also claimed was on the advice of the victim. In addition to the murder charges, prosecutors also accused them of theft, for taking the gold jewelry. Erin E. Arvedlund (NYT)",2004-12-09T05:00:00+0000

The Board of Trustees, management and staff of The Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System extends its deepest sympathies to the Freeman family; parents and John and Josephine (Dodi), son David and wife Ellen on the passing of their beloved daughter and sister Elizabeth. For almost 70 years the Freeman family has provided a strong and valued legacy of leadership and support to the Jewish Home. John has been an active trustee since 1960, currently serving on the Westchester (Sarah Neuman Center) Divisional Board. He was Jewish Home Board president from 1981 to '85 and his years of service were integral to the growth and development of the Home. His father, Charles also served as Board president from 1935 to 1940. David, continuing the family tradition, joined the Board in 1988 and serves as the chair of the Nominating Committee, member of the Marketing Committee and trustee of the System Board. Dodi is an original member of the Friends of Sarah Neuman, an auxiliary dedicated to high quality resident life at Sarah Neuman. Since joining the Friends, she has served as the group's historian and on numerous special event committees including their first ""Gourmet Tasting"" Fundraiser. We are grateful for the many contributions this involved, caring family has made to our System and our thoughts will be with John, Dodi, David and the entire Freeman family during their time of loss.

The government's statistics agency said its IPCA consumer price index, the central bank's main gauge in setting interest rates, rose 0.69 percent last month, a larger-than-expected increase, pressured by rising fuel costs. In October, the index rose 0.44 percent. So far this year, inflation has climbed 6.68 percent and it is expected to hit 7.4 percent by the end of December, according to a central bank survey released this week. While that would be higher than the government's year-end target of 5.5 percent, it would still be within a tolerance band of 2.5 percentage points. In 2005, the central bank hopes to bring inflation down to 5.1 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)",2004-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Still, her 29th New York gallery show in 59 years may startle you: Ms. Bourgeois has made some of the best drawings of her life this year. Not bad for a woman on the brink of her 93rd birthday who hasn't left her house in nearly a decade. Consisting of big batches of small, individually framed sheets, these works have a diaristic, slightly obsessive effect. They suggest different chapters of a book, each of which worries a single repeating motif into an impressive variety. One chapter (14 drawings) is all about densely worked grids in blue or black, with brown shadows. Another work, ""Tous les Cinque II,"" holds forth over the course of 76 drawings (detail above) on red concentric circles that occasionally break into dots or fade, like a television screen losing reception. In a third chapter, red parallel lines alternate with thicker ones whose undulating edges bring to mind both rick-rack and polyps. At once seismographic and decorative, these images distill the childhood trauma (her father had an affair with her nanny) that has long fueled Ms. Bourgeois's art and often overburdened her works in bronze, marble and installation. They are stream-of-consciousness abstractions, joyful exorcisms in the key of drawing. (Cheim and Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, through Dec. 31; free.)

WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times Company and one of the few remaining sources of classical music on the air in the New York area, has ended unlimited free streaming on the Web. The station signed an agreement with AOL's radio network, which is available only to AOL customers. The station's feed can be obtained free through AOL's Radio@Netscape service, but only for two hours a day. Tom Bartunek, the station's president and general manager, noting that WQXR is a commercial station, said the Web feed cost money every year but produced no revenue and had little such prospects. Moving to AOL, which is not paying WQXR for the feed but is picking up much of the streaming costs, is a way to maintain Web streaming and attract listeners who already use the AOL service. It has also improved the sound quality and provided a stereo broadcast, Mr. Bartunek said. WQXR had about 100,000 Web listeners several years ago, but the number through AOL is not yet available, he said. DANIEL J. WAKIN",2004-12-10T05:00:00+0000

The team, which included Susan Polgar, Irina Krush, Anna Zatonskih and Jennifer Shahade, won the silver medal last month at the 36th chess Olympiad in Calvia, Spain. It was the first time that a United States team had captured a medal at the Olympiads. The Kasparov Chess Foundation sponsored this year's team, and Mr. Kasparov helped its members prepare. In the past Mr. Kasparov has said that women could not play chess with men at the highest level and that he doubted that a woman would ever be world champion. Two years ago he lost a game to Judit Polgar, Susan's youngest sister. Asked on Wednesday if he had changed his assessment about whether a woman could become champion, Mr. Kasparov shrugged and said that he still did not think it would happen in the next 20 years. Judit Polgar is ranked No. 9 in the world, but there are no other women among the Top 100 players.

But underneath that bright smile and gentle manner there lies a resolve of steel. Her strength may have come from her Mexican bullfighting father or from her wide experiencing of American dance once she left her native Venezuela. Her determination has kept the company and its school going through some very tough times for American dance. The company went from earthy modern dance to a streamlined and increasingly slick ballet look. Now, the company is both earthy and classically elegant. It has also managed to do for transplanted Latin culture what others have done for black American lives in dance. One of the most moving performances of this year's Fall for Dance Festival at City Center was Ballet Hispanico's presentation of ""Desame Soar,"" a bittersweet dance by Alexandre Magno, which the company will perform tonight, tomorrow and Sunday night in a trilogy called ""Night Club."" The choreography and performing made a familiar story live, as testimony to the vibrant contribution, largely neglected in dance, of Latinos to American culture.

us,SPANISH CINEMA NOW,"The title character of the warm-hearted Spanish film ""Hector"" is a 16-year-old boy (played by Nilo Mur, above) who is taken in by his aunt's family after the death of his single mother, a drug addict and prostitute. Solemn, tense and prone to fits of vomiting at moments of anxiety, Hector served as his mother's caretaker during her decline. His suppressed anger comes to a boil when his rakish Mexican father, Martn (Damin Alczar), visits Spain in hopes of luring him to Mexico. The boy is caught in a psychological tug-of-war between his aunt Tere (Adriana Ozores), who narrates, and the biological father who abandoned the family when Hector was a child. The struggle is one of many dramas that swirl around him in the film, directed by Gracia Querejeta. The movie is one of the high points of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Spanish Cinema Now series, which runs at the Walter Reade Theater through Dec. 28. A similarly humane psychological realism informs ""Take My Eyes,"" also directed by a woman (Iciar Bollain), which swept the Spanish Academy Awards, winning seven Goyas, including best picture, director, actress (Laia Marull) and actor (Luis Tosar). The movie, which has its last screening tomorrow, is a beautifully observed story of a battered wife (Ms. Murull), whose scary husband seeks therapy for his abusive behavior and the couple's attempts to save their marriage just as she is venturing out of the house to work as a museum guide. Unlike most movies about domestic violence, ""Take My Eyes"" delves into the psychological roots of the husband's violence without sugar-coating his sincere efforts to change. It's a small, fine film without a false note. (""Hector"": tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.; ""Take My Eyes"": tomorrow night at 9, Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600.

That was lower than economists had expected for the surplus, which shrank for the second consecutive month. Exports rose 0.9 percent from a month earlier, to 4.97 trillion yen, while imports gained 3.2 percent, to 3.93 trillion yen. Slowing export growth is a concern for Japan because the current recovery has been largely driven by exports.

us,PLAYBACK NYC,"The form known as Playback theater uses the life stories of the audience to build drama, and it finds that audience in clubs, homeless shelters, prisons and schools as well as theaters. The tools are verbal improvisation, music, and the kind of forceful movement that creates characters instantly. The connection to commedia dell'arte is obvious. Commedia conquered Europe in the 16th century with its broad populist mockery of class divisions and social types. (Bumptious street clowns, greedy merchants, army braggarts, clever servant girls and sheltered but lively maidens are the types we know as Harlequin, Pantalone, the Captain, Columbine and Isabella.) Commedia troupes traveled light. They would set up a small stage in a public square, then don the masks and costumes that quickly identified each character. The only form today with that mobility and popularity is hip-hop. Rapping, D.J.-ing, break dancing: the elements are instantly recognizable So are the stories, from power struggles to celebrity gamesmanship. The eight actors (Margurite Hamden and David Gandy, above) and two musicians of Playback Theater New York have been working to fuse commedia and hip-hop since 1998. This weekend, after a series of workshops organized by the Hip-Hop Theater Festival, audiences can see the results.

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Brooklyn: Free Subway Transfers Urged,"Transportation advocates and politicians yesterday called for free street-level transfers between subway stations in Downtown Brooklyn. They said such transfers would be comparable to similar arrangements in Manhattan and Queens. But transit officials said such expanded transfers may cost as much as $90 million annually. The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, joined by two Council members, John C. Liu, above, and David Yassky, said MetroCard transfers should be free between stations that are not connected, as they are at two pairs of stations in Manhattan and Long Island City. A New York City Transit spokesman, Charles F. Seaton, said that such ""walking transfers"" have been permitted only when routes have been changed or construction disrupts service.

The signatories, coordinated by the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and including the presidents of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Catholics for Free Choice, as well as Gloria Steinem, contend that the show ""represented irresponsible programming"" by failing to provide a balance of perspectives on abortion. Moderated by Mr. Russert, the segment, broadcast on Nov. 28, was a roundtable discussion on religious and moral topics among the Reverends Jerry Falwell, Richard Land, Al Sharpton and Jim Wallis. ""It was predictable that abortion would be discussed,"" the letter stated, ""yet not one woman expert was involved, and three of the four participants are known for their anti-abortion views."" Though Mr. Sharpton supports abortion rights, the consortium argued that the discussion failed to present a ""pro-choice, biblical perspective"" on abortion. Two of the organizations contacted Mr. Russert's office on Nov. 24 to voice concern about the slate of panelists. Responding to an inquiry about the letter, Barbara Levin, senior communications director for NBC News, said Mr. Russert had seen it, and she added: ""For 58 years, 'Meet the Press' has set the standard for fairness and objectivity. We receive thousands of letters, e-mails and phone calls before and after each program, and everyone -- including special interest groups -- are most welcome to share their opinions.""

us,The Year in Ideas: A to Z,"In what has become an annual tradition, The New York Times Magazine takes stock of the passing year by creating a mini-encyclopedia of the most noteworthy ideas of the previous 12 months. We put out feelers, fine-tune our journalistic antennae and call on a fleet of reporters and researchers to scour the infosphere for the most captivating, baffling, promising and influential ideas from all walks of life -- not just science and technology, politics and policy, but also tattoo culture and fast-food management, horticulture and shoe design. Once we separate the wheat of innovation from the chaff of familiar notions, we offer up the alphabetical harvest now before you: 71 of the ideas that emerged -- in ways big and small, for better and worse -- in 2004. Connoisseurs of ""The Year in Ideas"" will discover a few changes in this issue, most notably the addition of the ingenious, whimsical photographs of Zachary Scott. But our central mission -- to salute the absurdly wide range of human originality and insight -- remains the same. You'll find innovations that will make you smile (""Self-Storage""), that will make you blink (""Eyeball Jewelry""), that will prompt speculation about the fate of nations (""Lawfare"") and that will inspire reverence for even the smallest applications of human reason (""The Best Way to Skip a Stone""). This year was also marked, of course, by a presidential election and an accompanying rise of interest in the social and cultural divisions of the United States; politics became a sort of prism for refracting all manner of concerns about American life. Accordingly, you'll find a healthy dose of entries on demographic trends (""Fertile Red States""), cultural happenings (""Purple-State Country Music""), technology (""The Global Political Positioning System"") and cris de coeur (""Neo-Secessionism"") that speak, one way or another, to the political moment. While no single digest could capture all the ideas of a nation as bountiful, if divided, as this one, this ""Year in Ideas"" issue presents at least a sampling of the way we were thinking in 2004.",2004-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Faces of authors smile down from newsstands; lines for author signings wind around a shopping mall; magazines and newspapers teem with book reviews, most of them glowing. So quick to protest, argue and rebel, the French turn into turtledoves when placed before a hardcover: ""Devour this book without moderation!"" a critic exclaims in Lire, France's best-known literary magazine.

The company has sold about 500,000 of these. The most popular version seems to be the one that looks the most like the Vuitton. Not surprisingly, the matter ended up in the courts. This past summer a federal judge in the Southern District of New York issued a ruling saying that while Dooney & Bourke had ""copied"" Louis Vuitton, it had not violated the French fashion giant's intellectual property rights, and could go about its business.

It wasn't just an act of random defacement. Picasso once said that ""every act of creation is first of all an act of destruction."" In this spirit, by leaving his mark on a work of art that is a reference to another work of art that is itself a send-up of a pop-cultural figure, Mr. Kantor was adding one more twist to the brief, ignoble history of artists vandalizing art in the name of art. In fact, Mr. Kantor, below at bottom, brought his own film crew to document the event. Herewith, a few colorful acts of creative destruction that artists have performed in recent years.

The first is that the land that is today Iran is the heir to a long line of remarkable predecessors. In its day, the Persian Empire was a superpower like nothing the world had ever seen-with a monotheistic religion, a vast army, a rich civilization, a new and remarkably efficient method of administration, and territory stretching from Egypt to Central Asia. All Iranians know that history well, and it is a source of enormous pride to them. It has given them a widely remarked sense of superiority over all of their neighbors, and, ironically, while Tehran now refers to the United States by the moniker ""Global Arrogance,"" within the Middle East a stereotypical complaint against Iranians is their own arrogant treatment of others.

The charges include theft, misappropriation of public property and tampering with records to thwart a state investigation. According to the indictment, Ms. Devereaux hired her sister, Candace Harper, as a consultant to review transactions with state vendors and to compile a vendor database.

But the network is now forsaking these old favorites, trading them in for late-model game shows like ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" and ""The Weakest Link,"" and some original programs, like the admittedly compelling ""Extreme Dodgeball."" It's too bad. Aside from their hosts' ubiquitous bow ties and their contestant-swallowing shag carpets, older shows offer something that seems inconceivable in today's world: the spectacle of distinguished intellectual and literary arbiters duking it out to, say, guess the identity of a pretzel twister or fire hydrant salesman.",2004-12-12T05:00:00+0000

The hope was that by providing an extra incentive for longer shots, the focus of the game would shift away from lumbering big men and back to sharpshooting guards, and dramatic come-from-behind victories would replace the league's frequent blowouts. Twenty-five years later, though, things haven't worked out as planned. American basketball players can throw down mind-blowing dunks, but leave them wide open for a jumper and chances are pretty good they're going to clang it off the rim.

Films like ""The Deer Hunter,"" below, with its brutal indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, and ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" from the generally shunned horror genre, probably owe their Oscars to the credibility and cachet they gained from the New York critics. The circle can also take credit for helping to set up many actors for an Oscar win, including Marcia Gay Harden, who was just a low-profile trouper in an art-house indie (""Pollock"") when she was suddenly thrust into the spotlight by New York's critics four years ago.

After hours of stilted envelope-opening banter, the award for best picture went to the German drama ""Head-On"" by Fatih Akin, about second-generation Turkish immigrants in Germany. The Spanish hit ""The Sea Inside,"" based on a true story about a paraplegic man's fight for the right to die, took the prizes for best director (Alejandro Amenbar) and best actor (Javier Bardem). (""The Sea Inside"" opens in limited release on Friday.) Imelda Staunton won best actress in ""Vera Drake"" by Mike Leigh, about a woman in postwar London who performs illegal abortions in secret. The Spanish director Pedro Almodvar had five nominations for ""Bad Education,"" though he left the ceremony empty-handed.

The film, which adds Catherine Zeta-Jones to the bank heist mix, took in an estimated $40.9 million over the weekend, almost $3 million more than ""Ocean's Eleven"" made in its opening weekend in 2001. A spokesman for Warner Brothers, the film's studio, said the opening take was the biggest for any film in December other than the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. ""Ocean's Twelve"" had more than double the box office take of the weekend's No. 2 film, New Line's ""Blade: Trinity,"" the sequel-of-a-sequel vampire movie produced by and starring Wesley Snipes, which took in $16.1 million. Since opening on Dec. 8, the film has grossed $24.1 million in the theaters. Three films that dominated the theaters for the last several weeks slipped to the lower rungs of the top five, though they continued to draw sizable audiences: ""National Treasure"" (Disney) made $9.8 million this weekend, bringing its cumulative sales to $124 million; ""Polar Express"" (Warner Brothers) took in $9.8 million, bringing its total to $110 million; and ""Christmas With the Kranks"" (Sony) pulled in $7.6 million, which brought it to just under $55 million in total. Wes Anderson's new film, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" (Buena Vista), didn't have such big numbers. It made $114,000 for its opening weekend -- but in only two theaters, in New York and Los Angeles. The film will have a wide release on Christmas Day. CATHERINE BILLEY",2004-12-13T05:00:00+0000

He was a pioneer in the struggle to raise professional and public awareness of the deadliness of oral cancer and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. He was a crusader against oral cancer for more than 50 years, starting at a time when many dentists weren't routinely doing oral cancer exams. Dr. Oringer used electrosurgery, a technique he invented, to remove suspected cancerous tissue for examination without the fear of spreading the disease through severed blood vessels. His 1957 lecture, presented at the Greater New York Dental Meeting, ""Electrosurgical Biopsy: A Safe and Simple Technique,"" was covered in the New York WorldTelegram ""Science and Medicine"" section. In 1964, as a consultant to St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, he helped to create an oral cancer prevention and detection clinic, making St. Francis the only hospital in New York to have such a facility. For the next 40 years he continued to lecture extensively on oral cancer at programs sponsored by the New York State Health Department, the American Dental Association, the American Cancer Society, and many other organizations. A loyal alumnus of NYU College of Dentistry, Dr. Oringer created a scholarship fund at his alma mater in 2000 so that students would be able to concentrate on their studies without suffering under the weight of heavy financial debt, parttime jobs, and other distractions. Born on June 18, 1905, he was the youngest of seven children and the only one born in this country.

A brisk real estate market has provided $413 million more from property sales and mortgage refinancings than the Bloomberg administration had anticipated, and the state's decision to delay a sales tax exemption on clothing items costing less than $110 has added $206 million.

After this, Ms. Mattila, above, was the toast of the town, raising the bar for her appearances this season in a rather different kind of opera, Janacek's ""Katya Kabanova."" Where ""Salome"" offers over-the-top drama, ""Katya"" is a piece about bourgeois life in the provinces: the only thing the works have in common is that both can be showpieces for a singing actress. ""Katya"" has been underperformed at the Met, and this revival of Jonathan Miller's production is here for only five performances, through Jan. 1, though it is hardly what one would call holiday fare. Other highlights of this revival are 100 percent Czech: the company debut of the eminent conductor Jiri Belohlavek and the Varvara of a popular mezzo who hasn't sung here often, Magdalena Kozena.

But it's comforting that the spirit of Roald Dahl lives and that child readers haven't been completely subjected to the tyranny of nice. Since the publication of the first book in the ""Unfortunate"" series several years ago, the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult after another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune.

us,The Listings; HOLIDAY WITH PRESTON STURGES,"Preston Sturges's most creative period lasted a mere eight years -- from his 1940 directorial debut, ""The Great McGinty,"" to ""Unfaithfully Yours"" in 1948 -- but that short time was enough to yield perhaps the most profound comic vision of American life ever recorded on celluloid. During the next three weekends the American Museum of the Moving Image will be screening eight classics by Sturges (above), beginning tomorrow at 2 p.m. with ""The Great McGinty,"" an ever more relevant fable of American politics in which an unemployed Chicagoan (Brian Donlevy) is selected as a sham candidate for governor by the local machine. At 4 p.m. tomorrow and 2 p.m. on Sunday, the series will present ""Sullivan's Travels,"" Sturges's most socially engaged film, about a lightweight Hollywood filmmaker (Joel McCrea) who embarks on a tour of underclass America as research for his ambitious new project, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (a title since appropriated by Joel and Ethan Coen). The series continues on Dec. 26 with Sturges's great romantic comedies, ""The Palm Beach Story"" and ""The Lady Eve"" (repeated on Jan. 1), and concludes on Jan. 2 with the film many critics consider Sturges's masterpiece, ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek."" A cheerfully blasphemous takeoff on the Nativity story relocated to the American home front of World War II, it finds a small-town good-time girl (Betty Hutton) mysteriously in a family way after spending a dimly remembered night with a soldier whose name may or may not have been Ignatz Ratskiwatski.

us,The Listings; ROGER BROWN,"Along with Leon Golub, H. C. Westermann and Jim Nutt, Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago in the post-World War II era. With a deadpan, seemingly artless touch, he blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio de Chirico, Grant Wood, Outsider Art and comic strips of the 40's to create expansive, deceptively simple, funny and mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. One of nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 in the first Brown exhibition in New York in 10 years, ""Buttermilk Sky"" (1974), above, is a masterpiece of grid-based patterning and all-American transcendentalist romance. Under phalanxes of ovoid clouds that recede to the horizon, silhouetted travelers pause on highways passing between rolling hills dotted by glowing bushes. The air feels charged by some pantheistic immanence. Maybe the Second Coming is at hand. It is here in the gallery, anyway, in a 1976 painting called ""An Actual Dream of the Second Coming,"" in which trumpeting angels hover against swollen black and red clouds that loom over burning forests, fields where lively skeletons appeal to heaven and a cartoon city by the lake.

us,The Listings; 'THE GOOD BODY',"December can be cruel to the waistline. More than the usual alcoholic consumption may be necessary to endure the office Christmas party. Baked goods, lately reduced to skulking around the fringes of the culinary world, are suddenly first-class citizens again. The scale beckons balefully from the corner of the bathroom. Before heeding its merciless call, it might be wise to pay a visit to Eve Ensler's ""Good Body."" In her new solo show at the Booth Theater, which will end its run on Sunday, the author of ""The Vagina Monologues"" dispenses theatrical therapy for audiences who can't manage to separate self-esteem from waist size. Ms. Ensler, above, feels our pain and intends to assuage it. Drawing on interviews with women who include a feisty black teenager and Helen Gurley Brown, Ms. Ensler sloughs off the psychological toxins absorbed from an image-obsessed American culture to find a measure of self-acceptance. True revelations may be in short supply -- ""The Good Body"" is not the galvanizing piece of agitprop that ""Vagina Monologues"" was -- but in the dark days of late December it is not new insight but simple comfort, preferably unaccompanied by calories, that is really needed. (This weekend's schedule: tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., and Sunday at 3 p.m., Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $86.25.)

Outsiders on the hunt for the usual Southwestern signatures -- turquoise, adobe, intermingled cultures, blue skies, chiles -- often fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport, then drive right away to Santa Fe or Taos and miss an opportunity. Albuquerque has the requisite turquoise and chiles, too, and charges less for them. But more, it has a lived-in, bustling, modernized kind of charm, with no forced quaintness. Unfreighted by tourists' ideas of how it should look and what it should offer, it often surprises. There's a buoyancy to the Southwest style here, and, in a not-unrelated development, probably more resident balloonists per capita than in any other city on earth.

Our sense of loss is immense, and our hearts and thoughts are with the Fisher family at this difficult time. Dick was a cherished member of the University community. He joined the Rockefeller board in 1994 and became its Chairman in 1998. The University was fortunate to have the benefit of his enormously effective leadership. His quiet strength and deep integrity meshed beautifully with a generosity and hugeness of heart. Dick possessed a remarkable ability to listen to others and build consensus, while encouraging debate and ensuring that all voices were heard. While we are bereft of a beloved leader, colleague, and friend, we give thanks for a life extraordinarily well lived. A man of deep intellectual curiosity, Dick was a remarkable business and civic leader, an enlightened patron of the arts, and a philanthropist of generosity and distinction. Among many other qualities, he will be remembered for his warmth, wit, and kindness. He was a great man, and he will be greatly missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Jeanne; his three children; and everyone whose life he touched.

Much depends on decisions that have more to do with fiscal and trade policy, the domain of President Bush and his merry band of weak-dollar-big-deficit policy makers, than with monetary policy, the domain of the Fed. That's because the administration's policies exert upward pressure on prices and interest rates, risking what a recent Fed staff report on trade imbalances calls ""wrenching changes.""",2004-12-18T05:00:00+0000

EATING YOUR WORDS (Oxford University, $20), edited by the former New York Times restaurant critic (and now a book critic) William Grimes, is the culinary equivalent of a Berlitz phrase book, a handy reference of more than 2,000 gastronomic terms and ingredients beginning with acorn squash and ending with zwieback. Making for an even richer feast is Grimes's introduction, a cogent account of how we've gone from being a people who once carelessly categorized all pastas as ""macaroni"" to a nation that knows its rigatoni from its rotelli. In the main text, Grimes includes a generous helping of shorter reflections, including a lexicon of diner slang and a consideration of the hot dog. Not quite as helpful are the unannotated lists (types of sugar, varieties of tea, the many guises a cake may take), which could leave you hungry for more explication. And there are gaps. If you say toe-MAY-toe and I say toe-MAH-toe, we may have to call the whole thing off, because we're given no preferred pronunciation. Still, once fortified by this verbal batterie de cuisine you'll be able to order huitlacoche, palacsinta, saganaki and a salmagundi with confidence. But not, one hopes, all off the same menu.

Flaubert's death in 1880 put an end to their enterprise, which was in essence endless, but not before the two brave explorers had read their way through many learned volumes on agriculture, literature, animal husbandry, medicine, archeology and politics, always with disappointing results.

He joined the Rockefeller board in 1994 and became its Chairman in 1998. The University was fortunate to have the benefit of his enormously effective leadership. His quiet strength and deep integrity meshed beautifully with a generosity and hugeness of heart. Dick possessed a remarkable ability to listen to others and build consensus, while encouraging debate and ensuring that all voices were heard. While we are bereft of a beloved leader, colleague, and friend, we give thanks for a life extraordinarily well lived. A man of deep intellectual curiosity, Dick was a remarkable business and civic leader, an enlightened patron of the arts, and a philanthropist of generosity and distinction. Among many other qualities, he will be remembered for his warmth, wit, and kindness. He was a great man, and he will be greatly missed.

A native of Chengdu (Sichuan), China, Dick has lived in the US for over 40 years. Among six other siblings, Dick was son of Lieutenant General William Shih-Chieh Diao (Cmdr 95th Army, Republic of China) and Pei-Chi Chen. Dick touched many lives with his infectious smile and gentle spirit. Dick received his economics degree at National Central University in Chungking, China, earned his MS at the University of Illinois, and did his PhD work at New York University. Dick returned to China with his fiance Eva Hsu in 1950 to work at the Central Ministry of Finance as a researcher. Dick taught economics at the Central Institute of Finance in Beijing until branded a ""rightist"" by the Communist Party and sent to a collective farm as a forced laborer. Dick subsequently fled to Hong Kong with his young son and was later joined by his wife and daughter, and then emigrated to the United States. Dick was a Research Associate at Columbia University while he completed his research on two published economic textbooks on the People's Republic of China. Dick and his family then moved to the Washington, DC area where he was an editor for 22 years at Voice of America (US State Department). Dick was deeply devoted to Eva, his beloved wife of 54 years, whom he had courted while she was attending college in Iowa, and the two returned to China together to pursue their life dreams.

Bonnaroo, founded in 2002 on a 700-acre farm in Manchester, Tenn., is a three-day smorgasbord of rock, jazz, bluegrass and a whole lot of jamming, with a lineup that reads like the contents of an enviable iPod; at last year's festival, Bob Dylan, Wilco, David Byrne, My Morning Jacket, Nellie McKay and Willie Nelson shared the mud with Doc Watson, Nellie McKay, Danger Mouse and Patti Smith.

In the blog, Washingtonienne, a Capitol Hill employee, used a Senate computer to post intimate details about her experience sleeping with six different men, some of whom were paying for her favors. Washingtonienne listed her partners by their initials and occupations, from the married ""Chief of Staff at one of the gov agencies, appointed by Bush"" to her current boyfriend, a fellow Senate staff member. Praising Washingtonienne for her candor and honesty (""You go, girl!""), Wonkette identified her as Jessica Cutler, a 26-year-old mail sorter for Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, who promptly fired her from her $25,000-a-year job. After a flurry of interviews in the newspapers and on TV, she sold a novel based on her blog to Hyperion for a figure that Wonkette estimated at $300,000.

Lee had surrendered his Virginia troops to General Ulysses S. Grant at the village of Appomattox Court House. Though some forces remained in the field, Lee had been the greatest obstacle on the path to victory. Now that his troops were out of the way, the bloodiest war in America's history would soon be over, and the celebrations had already begun. Four years to the day after its surrender, Fort Sumter was again under the Stars and Stripes. The flag raising there that day was marked with speeches, music, and prayers of thanks. There were prayers in Washington as well, but a lighter, more carefree atmosphere prevailed. There, buildings were ""illuminated"" with gas jets configured in the shape of stars, eagles, or words such as ""peace"" and ""victory."" The city's population, which had ballooned to more than two hundred thousand during the war, had gone crazy. The streets were crawling with silly, drunken revelers-soldiers back from the war, tourists passing through, and all the usual odds and ends-staggering from one bar to another in search of a party and another toast to the military victors. All things considered, maybe this Good Friday 1865 was not such a bad night for the theater after all. ",2004-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Your Blog or Mine?,"One of the first sex scandals of the blogosphere ended, of course, in a book deal. In May, Ana Marie Cox, the Internet gossip whose Web log, Wonkette, focuses on Washington, published a link to another blogger who called herself the Washingtonienne. In the blog, Washingtonienne, a Capitol Hill employee, used a Senate computer to post intimate details about her experience sleeping with six different men, some of whom were paying for her favors. Washingtonienne listed her partners by their initials and occupations, from the married ''Chief of Staff at one of the gov agencies, appointed by Bush'' to her current boyfriend, a fellow Senate staff member. Praising Washingtonienne for her candor and honesty (''You go, girl!''), Wonkette identified her as Jessica Cutler, a 26-year-old mail sorter for Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, who promptly fired her from her $25,000-a-year job. After a flurry of interviews in the newspapers and on TV, she sold a novel based on her blog to Hyperion for a figure that Wonkette estimated at $300,000. Cutler's agent announced that she would pose nude for Playboy but would not talk to the media until the book was published. Her privacy, after all, had to be respected. ",2004-12-20T05:00:00+0000

In the audience, it was opera buffa, written in part by the actor and playwright Wallace Shawn, right. At intermission, a patron reported that someone was secretly taping the performance, a major violation at the Met, which constantly struggles against bootlegging. When a security official arrived, according to Franois Giuliani, the Met's spokesman, he was told that the miscreant was wearing a blue shirt. When the official confronted Mr. Shawn, who was wearing a blue fleece, he could be seen standing with his arms out, saying: ""I didn't do it! I didn't do it!"" Mr. Giuliani called the officer off and apologized to Mr. Shawn. As of Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he did not know if the real culprit was caught. Mr. Shawn, however, said Sunday that he did not remember an apology and felt ""extremely upset and offended"" by the incident. ""This sort of thing does happen to me,"" he said. ""That may just be because I'm a paranoid person. A hundred people buy fruit in a grocery store and somehow I feel they come up to me and say, 'Are you stealing fruit?""' Mr. Shawn said he also did not relish the publicity. ""It's already encouraged me not to leave the house again."" DANIEL J. WAKIN",2004-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Spanish architects will design a bridge, which will double as one of the pavilions, to connect Zaragoza's high-speed train station with the fair grounds. Officials also plan to create a ""city of cinema"" that will take visitors through the steps of filmmaking.

His single ""Yeah!,"" featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris, was No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart for 12 weeks, and was immediately followed in the top slot by his ""Burn,"" which stayed there for eight weeks, giving him a 20-week consecutive run at the top of that Billboard list, a record. (The Hot 100 is calculated through a combination of sales and radio play.) ""Yeah!"" and ""Burn"" captured both the No. 1 and No. 2 slots on the magazine's year-end singles chart, which Billboard says is the first time one act has performed that feat since 1964, when the Beatles had ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You."" Usher didn't have a bad year with albums, either. The R&B crooner's ""Confessions"" (La Face) rode high in the Billboard charts not once but twice: the original release of the album, in March, reached No. 1, and a ""Special Edition"" reissue in October, with four additional tracks (including the hit ""My Boo,"" with Alicia Keys), reached No. 2.

Mr. Spitzer's office does not have formal authority over recognizing unions, but the students asked Mr. Spitzer's office to count the cards they signed in support of a union. The move was part of a wider campaign of pressure against Columbia. Graduate Student Employees United, a group affiliated with the United Automobile Workers, is seeking to unionize nearly 2,000 graduate assistants at Columbia. But last July, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that graduate assistants at private universities were students, not workers, and therefore did not have the right to form a union, even when a majority wanted one. Despite that ruling, the graduate students' group is seeking to pressure Columbia into recognizing such a union. Susan Brown, a Columbia spokeswoman, said the university was abiding by the N.L.R.B. ruling. Steven Greenhouse (NYT)",2004-12-21T05:00:00+0000

Zimmerman was the only daughter of the world-renowned pioneer of the global mutual fund, Sir John Templeton, and the wife of former Wyoming State Senator, Gail Zimmerman. Dr. Zimmerman earned her medical degree from Case-Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1974. Prior to that she worked in neuropsychological research at Massachusetts General Hospital and taught Biological Sciences near Boston and in Gaberones, Botswana, with the Peace Corps. After her marriage to Gail Zimmerman, Ph.D. in 1980, she opened a surgical practice in Casper, Wyoming. In addition, Dr. Zimmerman practiced clinical medicine in an urgent care clinic, and served as the Medical Director of the Natrona County Detention Center in Casper. She retired from her medical practice in 2003 to devote more time to the cause of international religious freedom, to take aid to those who are suffering and dying because of their faith and to specifically come alongside fellow Christians worldwide. In 1997, Zimmerman, Betsy Vigneri and Lisa Scaling founded the American chapter of the international human rights organization Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW). The group promotes human rights around the world, and in particular the basic rights of Christians in nations where they are persecuted. Her involvement with CSW took Zimmerman to the Sudan many times. Zimmerman's first trip to the war-torn African nation was made with Baroness Caroline Cox, the founder of CSW and a member of the House of Lords in the UK. She participated as a leading member of CSW buying the freedom of women and children who had been enslaved. Anne Templeton Zimmerman was a trustee of the John Templeton Foundation, established by her Father, Sir John Templeton in 1987 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. She is survived by her husband; her father; her children Rhonda, Mitchell, Michael and Renee Sterling; brothers John Templeton Jr., M.D., president of the John Templeton Foundation, and Christopher Templeton; a stepsister Wendy Brooks, and seven grandchildren.

The current account, the broadest measure of a country's trade in goods and services, registered a deficit of $242 million in November, in contrast to a surplus of $1.01 billion in October. In November 2003, Brazil posted a current-account deficit of $157 million. Despite last month's deficit, the central bank raised its year-end forecast for the current account to a surplus of $10.7 billion from $9.2 billion. Foreign direct investment held steady in November from the previous month, totaling a modest $1.32 billion, but fell from the year-earlier period, when nonresidents invested $1.95 billion in the country.

From the moment of her Met debut on January 31, 1955, she became a favorite of our audience and remained so well after she retired from singing. Mme. Tebaldi's opulent, powerful voice made her ideal for the core Italian repertory, and no one who heard her in the theater can forget the tremendous beauty and visceral impact of her interpretations. The epitome of the great Italian singing tradition, Tebaldi will remain a touchstone of that art for as long as people listen to opera. She considered the Met ""her"" opera house, and in many ways it was. The warmth she projected on stage added to the public's adoration, while her very real personal warmth and professionalism off stage made her a special favorite of those who worked behind the scenes on all levels of the staff and administration.

This year, Mr. Pataki looked over several petitioners' cases but decided that none merited clemency, Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor, said yesterday. Granting clemency does not free an inmate but does allow an immediate parole hearing. Clemencies are usually granted to prisoners who are serving time for nonviolent offenses and have behaved well in prison.

The report's recommendation drew sharp criticism from several groups, including the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, which said Shariah contradicts Canadian laws of equality for women. Provincial law already gives religious authorities limited powers to arbitrate civil matters, but plans to extend those rights to include Shariah have stirred bitter debate. The report, prepared by Marion Boyd, a former Ontario attorney general and a feminist activist, also recommends safeguards to ensure that neither party in a Shariah arbitration is subject to domestic violence and that there be ample opportunities to appeal decisions.

Mr. Saatchi, the owner of the Saatchi Gallery in London, which is dedicated to promoting young British artists like Tracey Emin, bought the work 14 years ago for $92,000. A spokesman for Mr. Saatchi said the deal was likely to be clinched in the next few weeks. The spokesman confirmed that the offer had come from a client of the American art dealer Larry Gagosian, Mr. Hirst's New York agent. The sculpture, ""The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living"" (1991), above, was commissioned by Mr. Saatchi. Mr. Hirst used a shark bought in Australia for $11,000. In 2003, Mr. Saatchi sold 12 early works back to Mr. Hirst for a reported $14.45 million, and recently he sold another Hirst work, a sheep in formaldehyde titled ""Away From the Flock,"" for $2.8 million.

And who was she; the lover of this artist, famous for his womanizing; the new bride of a patron; or simply an idealized portrait of a Renaissance woman? These puzzles and more are occasioned by the sensuous painting of a half-length nude now on view at the Frick Collection. With her head covered by a bejeweled silk turban; a face distinguished by lustrous brown eyes and an ambiguous Mona Lisa expression, and breasts bared as she holds a piece of diaphanous material in a feeble gesture of cover-up, the lady has caused speculation among centuries of scholars. On her left arm she wears a bracelet with Raphael's signature on it, but the work was not listed, shortly after his death, among those done by the artist. Recent speculation has it that she may be Francesca Ardeasca, the bride of Raphael's greatest patron, Agostino Chigi, painted by the master in commemoration of Chigi's marriage to her. In any case, the painting, lent by the National Gallery of Art at the Palazzo Barberini in Rome, is shown here for the first time, as part of a three-city tour that will include Houston and Indianapolis. Whoever she was, ""La Fornarina"" is well worth looking at. (The Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 30.

Toward the end of Act I, not long after ""Chrysanthemum Tea"" (a deliciously polite song about poisoning), the show turns gloriously playful with ""Welcome to Kanagawa."" The mid-19th-century Japanese have sworn to fend off the foreign invaders, led by Commodore Perry, but at this point -- with the Shogun dead -- some of them are having second thoughts. A local madam (Francis Jue, far right above, a Chinese-American from Northern California, looking his loveliest in ethnic drag) assesses the situation musically with an exhilarating conviction that much of the show lacks. ""When a country is in trouble/Choices are few,"" the madam sings. ""And apart from charging double/ What can you do?"" If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, especially if these strange giants have money to spend. The cost is 20 yen for music and food, a little extra for an even warmer welcome. The madam goes over the establishment's sexual menu (""That you'll have to bend for,"" ""That you'll need a friend for""), and her ""girls"" (from left above, Mayumi Omagari, Daniel Jay Park, Yuka Takara and Hazel Anne Raymundo), some of whom are fresh off the farm, soon get into the spirit of things, expressing their enthusiasm with girlish refrains of ""Yo ho!""

The eight-episode series, in which two sets of contestants who mirrored the original ""Gilligan's Island"" characters competed to be rescued, drew an average of 3.05 million viewers, according to Nielsen's overnight numbers. On the two-part finale Tuesday night, Glenn Stearns, who filled the island's millionaire slot, won the competition. The second part of the broadcast was advertiser-supported cable's most-watched show on Tuesday in total viewers, and in the coveted 18-to-49 demographic, it outperformed CBS's ""Kennedy Center Honors,"" WB's ""High School Reunion"" and a repeat of UPN's ""Veronica Mars"" in the 9 p.m. hour.

The director Philip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff"") and others came to Ms. Monga's defense as theater employees quit and small distributors withdrew their offerings in protest. The Castro's owners, Ted Nasser and the Nasser family, said the firing was a business decision and replaced Ms. Monga with a Los Angeles booker who handles 17 movie houses. Local filmgoers formed Audiences in Action to fight her firing and denounce programming that they fear will commercialize the historic art house. The group has organized a boycott from Jan. 1 to 5 in hopes of dealing a financial blow to the Nasser family and forcing Ms. Monga's return. CAROLYN MARSHALL",2004-12-24T05:00:00+0000

But jazz does keep a few unshakeable core identities, and in the end they are not ideas but people: the warrior band leaders who play week after week, year after year, spreading a time-tested language. The pianist Cedar Walton is one of them. Mr. Walton, who refined his technique in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers during the early 1960's, has a style rooted in be-bop. But he never sifted out his vernacular blues and soul phrases, the licks that soften the edges of complexity. And all of that comes filtered through a delicate, precise keyboard touch, producing a chiseled sound when he wants to be loud and a nearly silky rustle when he is accompanying a bass solo in a ballad. Now 70, he brings in his trio for two weeks every December to the Village Vanguard, adding a different fourth member each week; this week it's the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring. Mr. Walton, in this gig in particular, has come to be one of life's dependable pleasures.

The program was started in 1968 by Alexander Schneider, and has been led by Jaime Laredo (above, at a recent rehearsal) since Schneider's death in 1993. Many of the program's alumni have gone on to careers in orchestras and chamber groups, and there have been some famous soloists as well, among them the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the violinists Pamela Frank, Cho-Liang Lin and Gil Shaham. Mr. Shaham returns to the orchestra tonight as the soloist in Saint-Sans's ""Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso"" and Dvorak's Romance in F minor.

By my early 30's, I was a sedentary ex-jock going to fat and dealing with a bad back. My doctor told me to do dead lifts. I bought a cheap set of barbells and weights, stood in front of the living-room mirror and to the amusement of my children performed set after set of dead lifts until my back muscles began to loosen up. Then, bored, I did a few barbell curls, a few standing shoulder presses and lay on the living room rug to do a few bench presses. A few months later I was astonished to discover that I had lost fat and gained muscle. So I went looking for a gym.",2004-12-26T05:00:00+0000

Ray has quickly become a food-world phenomenon -- arguably this country's best-selling cookbook writer. She has had three books in the top five of the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list this year (""30-Minute Meals,"" ""30-Minute Meals 2"" and ""Cooking 'Round the Clock""), and last week she cracked the children's chapter book list with ""Cooking Rocks."" Ray's books are like her shows: friendly and unpretentious. She emphasizes fresh ingredients but isn't afraid, once in a while, to take the kinds of shortcuts that make some foodies cringe. (Her recipe for Chicken Caesar Romaine lettuce wraps tells you to go ahead and make them with a supermarket rotisserie bird.) Ray's travel guide, ""$40 a Day,"" distills the populist ethos that helps her connect with viewers. She'd rather talk about great but inexpensive restaurants than talk about Le Cirque, she writes, because ""a television show shouldn't have the power to make one feel left off the first-string team in life.""

At one side of the canvas a man rests his elbow on the table to support the weight of his head. At the opposite end of the table another man jabs an accusatory finger at an older man halted in midappeal. Around them, other figures despair, contemplate, glare. The viewer vainly searches the composition for the central Christ figure but finds him missing. The man who occupies the center of Lerner's composition holds the attention of no one; instead he stares at a white page he holds in his hands. You get the impression that there is no central Christ figure. There are only apostles, or possibly, only Christs.",2004-12-26T05:00:00+0000

The year 2004 will be the first in four that the music business has managed to increase American album sales. But sales are up about 2 percent, a meager showing over last year's weak figures. That places high pressure on artists to ferret out other sources of income. The stars-turned-marketers range from Britney Spears (television movie, fragrance) to Lil Jon (energy drink, adult film and soon an authorized Halloween costume). But few have out-hustled 50 Cent, the Queens-bred rap star who has been striking deals with the urgency recommended so starkly in the title of his debut CD, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'."" Sources close to the artist say 50 Cent's forays into fashion, entertainment and even beverages in the last 12 months or so generated income in the $50 million range.

He knew that such work could be lethal: 10 Russian journalists had been murdered in contract killings since Putin came to power. But Klebnikov believed in Russian redemption. In an editorial in the first issue of Forbes Russia -- which began publishing in April, with Klebnikov as editor -- he declared that Russia had entered a more civilized stage of development. He started telling his friends and colleagues that he was sure the lawless days were over. He was even considering moving his wife and three children from New York to Moscow.

No, I caught him on a late-night television viewing of the overripe Tennessee Williams vehicle ""The Fugitive Kind,"" in which he is called upon, somewhat implausibly, to make goo-goo eyes at an aging and desperate Anna Magnani rather than at a very young if crazy Joanne Woodward, and yet manages to cradle Magnani's ravaged face in his hands as if it were the only one that spoke to him. (Nevermind the disheartening truth of the matter, as revealed in Peter Manso's biography, which is that Brando went out of his way to reject Magnani's advances at every opportunity.) Years later, I would try to capture the combustible effect Brando had on me by composing a poem in a college writing class that transformed him into a verb. It was addressed to some love object of the moment, to whom I paid the highest compliment I could think of. ""You Marlon Brando me,"" I wrote, meaning that the subject of the poem had bypassed all the subtle indexes of wit and sophistication by which I usually measured men and gone straight to the heart of my amorous craving.",2004-12-26T05:00:00+0000

They are imitating an imitation. Your average Ed Sullivan is by now seventh or eighth generation -- someone saw someone who saw a commercial starring someone who saw someone who saw Jackie Mason imitating the impressionist Will Jordan. Sullivan never said, ""A really big shew""; he never cracked his knuckles or swung his arms around. Those were Jordan's inventions. For that matter, Cary Grant never said ""Judy, Judy, Judy.""

Small touches make a difference. Fine fresh bread crumbs made from white sandwich bread and an egg provide mortar for the fish. Mix it lightly, or mortar it will be. Fry the cakes in good butter and let them brown before you get all anxious with your spatula. With the coleslaw, you need a dressing that's hefty enough to wilt the cabbage.

Such rejections only steel his or her resolve, of course, and so lead to the second phase, in which the single-minded capitalist forges ahead alone -- borrowing, scrimping, hustling -- to create the product everyone has said will fail miserably. In the third phase, he or she enjoys a ""liquidity event"": the thriving business is bought at a huge premium, and the entrepreneur in turn cashes out.",2004-12-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Rothschild's legacy included a life filled with passion for his family, serving his community, achieving excellence in the workplace, and a desire to travel the world. Steve exemplified the rare combination of high intelligence tempered by gentle humor. He lived every day to its fullest, never wasting a moment. In his limited spare time he ran marathons, baked breads that he delivered to any and all who would accept them, raced cars and took up golf. He devoted his private time to his family, a value taught to him by his parents, the late Alfred and Ilse Rothschild. He was the Managing Partner of the Delaware office of Skadden Arps, which he helped found more than 25 years ago. In addition to being a successful attorney and business leader, Mr. Rothschild was committed to and passionate about serving his community. His community service included, but was not limited to, having served as President of United Way, President of The Kutz Home for the Aged, President of The Delaware Art Museum, and Finance Chair for Senator Carper. As importantly, he was a mentor not only to his sons, but also to young leaders in the broader community. Steven Rothschild touched the lives of those who knew him. His desire to give back to his professional and social communities carried over into the field of education. Mr. Rothschild taught at the law schools of both Georgetown and The University of Pennsylvania as an adjunct professor, and served as a trustee of the University of Delaware.

""It seems that the Blair government's capacity to disappoint knows no bounds,"" he said in an interview published in The Sunday Telegraph. His remarks swelled a chorus of criticism since Fiona McTaggart, a government minister in the Home Office, which is responsible for law and order, declined last week to criticize the forced ending of the play's run at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in the British Midlands. The play, by the Sikh playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, is set partly in a Sikh temple and includes references to rape, homosexuality and murder. The theater canceled its run eight days ago after hundreds of Sikh protesters besieged the theater and clashed with the police. Mr. Rushdie, who was forced into hiding under police protection after the Iranian authorities pronounced a death sentence on him in 1989, said that ""it has been horrifying to see the response"" from the government to the play's cancellation. He continued: ""It is pretty terrible to hear government ministers expressing approval of the ban and failing to condemn the violence when they should be supporting freedom of expression. The minister is sending entirely the wrong message."" ALAN COWELL",2004-12-27T05:00:00+0000

Of Palm Beach, FL, a private investor, sportsman, and philanthropist died on Friday, December 24, 2004 at Hospice of Palm Beach County following an extended illness. He was 97. Born in Barrie, Ontario (Canada) on May 10, 1907, his parents were Thomas Henry Ford and the former Rachel Mary Jones. His family moved to Rochester, New York when he was a child, where he completed his secondary education and then graduated from the University of Rochester, College of Engineering. Mr. Ford was a leader and innovator who never allowed anything to deter him from further exploration. At the age of 38, he left his position as Vice President of Engineering at the Rochester Manufacturing Company to establish a new company when he became aware of a major deficiency in the manufacturing industry of heavy electronic transformers and generators of diesel engines while using gas and flame without protective devices from unexpected accidents.In 1948, Mr. Ford founded QUALITROL Corporation in Fairport, New York to fill that need and provide the electric utility industry with the protective devices and monitor the systems for transmission and distribution. He opened a branch of QUALITROL in Waynesboro, TN to manufacture valves. Mr. Ford bought the MICROCONTROL in St. Louis, MO, a manufacturer of thermostats, and the DYNAPAR CORPORATION in Gurney, IL a manufacturer of digital controls. In the late 1960's, he sold all of his business interests to devote more time to his love of sports. As a child, Mr. Ford was a natural athlete who excelled in skiing, hunting, horseback riding, salmon fishing, and sailboat racing. Of all these activities,the one that Mr. Ford always referred to with the most passion was sailboat racing. He started sailing at the age of twelve and was ""hooked"" at the tender age of fifteen when he crewed in a Canadian Cat dingy. (He later introduced from England the International 14' racing dingy) Over the years, Mr. Ford won countless cups in national and international waters with different sailing boats, some of which he helped to improve the design. Among his many championships, he won the Canadian Douglas Cup in 1934 as the first American to win it since 1925; the Rochester Race that covered several hundred miles across fresh water; the Isaac Bell Trophy at Cowes Week in England; and several races in the Great Lakes. Mr. Ford was an upland game hunter most of his life and helped increase the membership in the Ruffed Grouse Society of North America from 150 members to 3000 members after he became its President. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club; the Rochester Yacht Club; The New York Yacht Club; the the Rochester Country Club; the Sporting Rock Beach Association in Newport, R.I.; and the Everglades Club, and the Bath and Tennis Club both of Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Ford was very interested in good, responsible government. Among his many friends were General Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller, as he organized the industry in support of their political campaigns. He was a past Chairman of the Palm Beach Long Range Financial Planning Committee, and most recently was very active in the Absentee Vote of Republicans Abroad. Mr. Ford was preceded in death by his first wife Mary Louise Watters Ford, who died in 1970. In 1974, he married the former Beatriz Algarra-Cuellar of Bogota, Columbia. In addition to his wife, Beatriz, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Louise Ann Ford; and a grandson, Nicholas George Grant, both of London, England. The family will receive friends on Wednesday, December 29, 2004 from 6:00 until 9:00 PM at Quattlebaum Funeral Home 1201 South Olive Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL 33401. A Funeral Service will be held at 11:00 AM on Thursday, December 30, 2004 at the Royal Poinciana Chapel, Palm Beach, FL, with Dr. Robert Norris, Pastor, officiating. Further services and entombment at Queen of Peace Cemetery will be held privately.

Dr. Fernando Rielo Pardal, founder of the Idente Missionaries, died approximately 10 p.m. on Monday, December 6, 2004, at the age of 81. He expired surrounded by the members of one of his religious communities in the City of New York, where he had been residing for purposes of medical treatment since 1988. Although the great physical suffering which marked his last years gradually exhausted his vital energy, he kept a lucid mind until the end. We, his spiritual sons and daughters, have constantly received strength from his fragility. He has left us the inheritance of his passionate love for the Most Blessed Trinity, his profound sense of being a son of the Church, and a heart merciful towards all. Dr. Rielo was born in Madrid in 1923. On June 29, 1959, in Tenerife (Spain), he founded a Catholic religious institute, the Institute Id of Christ the Redeemer, Idente Missionaries, canonically recognized as an Institute of Consecrated Life with missions in 25 countries in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. He promoted several non-profit religious, cultural and scientific organizations: the Idente School; the Fernando Rielo Foundation, best known for the annual World Prize for Mystical Poetry; and the Idente Youth Association. His cultural creativity, based on his metaphysical, theological and literary meditations, has given rise to numerous written works, many of which are as yet unpublished. At this time, when grief over his absence and joy over his his absence and joy over his arrival in our Father's House go hand in hand, we send our heartfelt thanks for your prayers for his eternal rest and for the spiritual growth of the enterprise he has entrusted to us.

The news program has improved on its average audience from last season by more than a million viewers, and it is tied for 12th with ""The Apprentice"" among primetime network shows. On Sunday, with the football playoffs looming, the ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl profiled the strategies of two National Football League coaches, the New England Patriots' Bill Belichick and the Carolina Panthers' John Fox. The news magazine's numbers tipped the scales for a CBS victory in Nielsen's overnight ratings, as that network barely edged out ABC in total viewers. But CBS's lineup could not beat ABC among 18-to-49-year-olds, even though it featured a network premiere of ""Ocean's Eleven"" from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. and ABC's programming consisted entirely of repeats.

Armando Calidonio, the vice minister of security, said another six people were detained for belonging to gangs but had so far not been linked directly to the latest violence.

But a lawyer representing some women seeking legal redress for what they claim were unnecessarily invasive pat-down searches that in some cases constituted ""groping or fondling,"" said yesterday that the modifications, though they ""slightly minimize the randomness of the selection"" of whom to search, were inadequate. The modified policy now states: ""Patting down the chest area will now only be conducted if it alarms a hand-held metal detector or if there is an irregularity or anomaly in the person's clothing outline. Unless these criteria are met, screeners will only pat down a line below the chest area to the waist, followed by a pat-down of the individual's entire back."" But Norman Siegel, the civil rights lawyer representing the women, said, ""I do not believe the announced changes address the heart of the issue."" He and some of his clients have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow with the agency in Washington. One concern, he said, is that ""since many women wear underwire bras, the wand is going to go off,"" subjecting that woman to a ""degrading"" pat-down search. The agency has said that screeners ""are trained to conduct the inspections in a professional, respectful manner, while maintaining our high level of security.""",2004-12-28T05:00:00+0000

The board's vote was 3 to 2, along party lines, with Democrats in the majority. The Republican, Steve Troxler, and the Democrat, Britt Cobb, will again be the only candidates in the election, which is not yet scheduled. The county had been told that the machine's memory capacity was much larger than it was. When it reached capacity it stopped recording votes while seeming to continue, said Jack Gerbel, president of the UniLect Corporation, which made the machine. The board had earlier decided on a new vote limited to Carteret County, but a state judge ordered the board to find a different solution. Ariel Hart (NYT)",2004-12-30T05:00:00+0000

The pipeline will draw gas from the Tarim Basin in the remote inland Xinjiang region and distribute it to towns and cities as far east as Shanghai. The pipeline will carry up to 12 billion cubic meters of gas a year by 2007, officials from the National Development and Reform Commission, a government agency responsible for long-term economic strategies, said at a news conference. Construction of the pipeline began in July 2002 and has cost $36 billion. The Chinese government has said it will reduce the reliance of the energy-hungry east on coal and oil. But multinational companies that were involved in negotiations to participate in the project, including Royal Dutch/Shell and the Exxon Mobil Corporation, pulled out earlier this year over concern that government limits on gas prices will make it commercially unviable. The pipeline is operated by PetroChina, a government-controlled company. Chris Buckley (NYT)",2004-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Landau (Bobbie), his oldest daughter Madeline Landau, a political anthropologist, and his youngest daughter Claudia Landau, MD, gerontology. Marty Landau (as he would say, ""the school teacher, not the actor"") was born in 1921 in Brooklyn, New York, to Harry and Clara Landau and is survived by his brothers, Gerry and Herb, and his sister Bernice. After distinguished service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Martin received his BA from Brooklyn College and Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University of New York-joining the Department of Political Science at U.C. Berkeley in 1971, where he taught until retirement. He was the recipient of numerous awards for his renowned teaching and scholarly work in organization theory, decision theory and the philosophy of social science-which included the application of the theory of redundancy to the design of effective organizational systems. His awards include the Danforth Foundation Harbison Award for Distinguished Teaching and Scholarship, and the Docteur Honoris Causa from the University of Paris. He served as a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow; a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences; and as a senior fellow at the National Academy of Public Administration. Martin founded and directed the Hong Kong Project for 17 years-a professional development program in organization and decision theory, funded by the Hong Kong Government, at the Goldman School of Public Policy. He served as a consultant on organizational design in the United States and abroad, including Thailand, Italy, France, the Philippines and Nepal. Martin Landau supported the labor movement and the civil rights movement - contributing to Thurgood Marshall's historic planning sessions for Brown Vs the Board of Education. He was dedicated to the racial integration of education and all institutions - and worked closely with Horace Bond at Lincoln University and with John H. Franklin at Brooklyn College. His motto was FDR's ""the only thing to fear is fear itself"". His political and intellectual commitment will continue through an application of organization theory to effective strategies of social change for the poor and discriminated ethnic communities in the United States. Gifts and donations in his memory can be made to the Martin Landau Center on Organization and Social Change at the Institute of Governmental Studies, at U.C. Berkeley (510) 642-1474.

In approximately 1946, Semha traveled to England and Scotland pursuing post-graduate training, and in 1948 accepted an invitation to sail on the Queen Mary to the USA. In New York, she was introduced to the fledgling Iraqi Jewish community, and met and married George Nathaniel, also of Baghdad.

A multicultural artist in the 1960's and 70's, working in film, performance, sound, print, sculpture and drawing, she was doing it all before there really was an all, as is suggested here by text pieces, photographs and her extraordinary film ""Fly"" (1970-71). She was also part of a loosely knit but collaboration-intensive avant-garde. John Cage was part of it; so were Robert Smithson and Gordon Matta-Clark, who is represented here by designs for housing projects to float on the Hudson River. The fringe-of-the-fringe filmmaker Jack Smith, now a hero to a new generation of young artists, was in the mix. He influenced the Brazilian conceptualist Hlio Oiticica (1937-1980), who lived in New York in the 1970's. An installation by Oiticica and Neville D'Almeida titled ""CC2 Onobject"" (1973, above) is the show's big piece. (Lelong now represents the Oiticica estate.) It's a combination of padded cell and playpen, with pictures of Charles Manson flashing on the wall to the sound of Ms. Ono's keening voice.

He was 88. Born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1916, Silberstein was a 'Hoosier' at heart. He attended Indiana University on a basketball and tennis scholarship and was a key member of the university's 1935 ""Big 10"" Basketball championship team. It was there he met his wife of 61 years, Sylvia Levin. They married October 12, 1937, in Crown Point, Ind. Shortly after college Mr. Silberstein started a chain of jewelry stores. He also ventured into the real estate business. It was after the Silbersteins moved to Scarsdale in 1950 that Mr. Silberstein with the dedicated help of his wife founded Sealectro Corp., a lucrative electronic components company, which went public in the 1970s and was later sold to BICC in 1981. Today the company is currently known as ITT Sealectro. The Silbersteins relocated to Rye in 1968, where Mr. Silberstein has resided since. Mrs. Silberstein passed away in 1998. In 1985 Mr. Silberstein established William Silberstein Associates, Inc. in Mamaroneck, New York. The organization provides operational assistance to manufacturing concerns, acquisitional evaluation of companies and organizes capital ventures. The Silbersteins shared a deep philosophy for giving back to the community. The couple owns the distinction as donors of the first fully endowed athletic scholarship in the history of Indiana University. Each year three fully endowed athletic scholarships are given to the basketball players for notable achievements. Locally, their generosity has extended to the medical community. At the White Plains Hospital Center, The William and Sylvia Silberstein Neonatal and Maternity Center, Silberstein Pavilion and Silberstein Cardiology Center and the sponsored William and Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Institute at New York University Medical Center were all established through the financial support of Mr. and Mrs. Silberstein. The couple also established a foundation in their names, the William and Sylvia Silberstein Foundation, to support other charitable causes including The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the United Jewish Appeal. Above all of his successful enterprises and life accomplishments, William Silberstein always placed his family and friends first. He gave and received bounteous love, joy, and wholeness through his children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. William Silberstein is survived by a daughter, Betsy Levinson; a son, Bruce, and his wife, Carolyn; a son, Sigmund; his five grandchildren, Beth Grotta, Jill Altneu, Debbie Deitz, Michael Silberstein and Matthew Silberstein; and three great - grandchildren, Mat thew and Lindsey Grotta, and Brooke Altneu. ""I had a life replete with excitement and challenges. My success can be attributed to luck, hard work, and timing. I love being around people and have been fortunate in having in my life, my family and many good friends,"" said Silberstein, reflecting on his life in a 2000 interview.

us,The Listings; JACQUES TATI'S 'PLAYTIME',"At the time of its release in 1967, Jacques Tati's ""Playtime"" was the most expensive movie ever made in France. Filmed on an elaborate set made of high-rise glass and steel office buildings, a glittering restaurant and a sleek airline terminal, it is an examination of the rhythms and peculiarities of modern life without plot or characters, and a comic extravaganza largely without jokes. Tati, in the trademark high-waters and narrow-brimmed fedora of his alter ego, Monsieur Hulot, stumbles through the streamlined chaos of modern consumer capitalism, a landscape of loneliness and disconnection, but also one that is both charming and sublime. Tati's ambitions for the film were enormous -- he spent 10 years trying to make it, and shot it in grand, screen-filling 70 millimeter, the form in which it is being shown at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. If you need a break from the noise and frenzy of the holidays -- or, for that matter, if you didn't get enough noise and frenzy -- this odd masterpiece may be just the ticket. (Today through Wednesday, Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, Tickets: $10; students with ID, $7; Film Society of Lincoln Center members, $6; 65+, $5 for weekday matinees only; children 6 to 12, $5.)

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   GLASER, MILES RUDOLPH","GLASER -- Miles Rudolph. Died peacefully on December 24, 2004 at M.D. Anderson Hospital after a courageous battle with cancer. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on May 2, 1925 he was the son of Dr. Oskar and Marketa Glaser, both of whom perished in the concentration camps. Miles survived three brutal years in the camps and upon being liberated in May 1945 returned to Prague. When the Communists came to power in 1948, he was smuggled across the border into Austria and resided in Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1949. Miles held various jobs in Chicago and New York City before moving to Houston in 1954 as the representative of a foreign owned steel exporter. He became an American citizen in 1955, and for the next twenty years continued as an executive in the steel business, eventually becoming the owner of Global Steel. It was during this time that he met John de Menil and his wife Dominique, from which grew a life long friendship. He was invited to become a member of the Menil Foundation Board and served as the Chief Financial Officer of the Menil Foundation until his retirement in the late 1990s. He remains the Emeritus member of the board. Miles is survived by his wife, Slavka, to whom he was married for ten years. She and his friends will remember him as an extraordinary man, filled with a passion for life and an unwavering belief in the rights of each individual. He suffered no fools and defended fiercely the principles of loyalty, ethics, and freedom. He did not bend to the particular winds of the day, but steered his own course with humor and wisdom. Those who knew Miles will never forget him; he touched us all. By his own wishes he will be privately cremated.
