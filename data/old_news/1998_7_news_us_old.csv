New Yorkers may be forgiven if they're perplexed to see that the mathematical symbol used for calculating the area of a circle has been stamped on sidewalks all over the city. The graffiti are the work of Darren Aronofsky, a filmmaker, who has found an unusual way to promote ''Pi: the Movie,'' his thriller, which opens July 12. The film, about a mathematician who unlocks the secret of the stock market, is only one piece of an unlikely pi trend. ''The Joy of Pi,'' a book by David Blatner (Walker & Company, 1997) includes a history of attempts to calculate the infinite number (3.14159265 etc.), pi jokes and odd factoids. For instance, Mr. Spock of ''Star Trek'' once foiled an evil computer by ordering it to ''compute to the last digit the value of pi.'' ",1998-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Downsized All the Way,"Terms like ''layoff'' and ''downsizing'' have become so common they have lost their power to alarm. CLOSING: The Life and Death of an American Factory (Double Take/Norton, $27.50) restores their emotional impact. Bill Bamberger, a photographer, and Cathy N. Davidson, a professor of English at Duke University, chronicle the final months of the White Furniture Company in Mebane, N.C. A family-owned business, White was established in 1881, bought out in a hostile takeover by a manufacturing corporation in 1985, and shut down in 1993. With piercing, candid photographs, Bamberger documents the dismantling of the factory and its workers' livelihoods. The photographs capture the shock, uncertainty and despair of what Davidson calls the ''human spirit . . . downsized.'' While the images record the factory's death, they are also vibrant reminders of its life. Bamberger preserves the spirit of its employees and their pride in their craft. Davidson's eloquent text describes, in concise, vivid detail, the stories of five employees who ''represent a cross section of the American work force.'' In an unflinchingly fair analysis, she writes of their independence and fulfillment at White, but resists the temptation to idealize the factory and denounce the corporate players behind the buyout and the closing. Hard-edged and realistic, ''Closing'' offers no sugar-coated solutions. Instead, in using White's as a microcosm of what is wrong with the American economy, it issues a bold challenge to ''business as usual.'' Stephanie Sun",1998-07-05T05:00:00+0000

The Juvenile Court magistrate, Joseph Coyte, asked if he had anything to say. Jerry, who had dropped out of school, had been on probation for stealing a car when he cut off his ankle monitor and fled for San Diego to live with his sister. There, he smoked marijuana and hung out until deciding he'd had enough of being on the run. He then turned himself in. The prosecutor asked that the judge send him to a youth prison.

Unless you've been dwelling under a rock, the name of this 12th-century German abbess should at least sound vaguely familiar by now. Though never formally canonized, Hildegard has achieved an eccentric sort of sainthood, having been adopted as an icon by partisans of such renegade causes as Creation Spirituality and feminism. In the last two decades, her vivid prose, mystical paintings and singular music, all conceived in visions said to have been induced by debilitating migraines, have been whooshed from centuries of monastic obscurity to New Age celebrity by a flurry of performances and publications.",1998-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Years With No Handles,"The stories in STRIPPING AWAY THE SORROWS FROM THIS WORLD (Mercury House, paper, $14.95) grow out of the land Jesus Gardea writes about: the vast, unforgiving plains and broken-down settlements of the northern part of Mexico. ''Around here,'' a character in a story called ''No Loss'' is told while clearing a junk-filled lot for what turns out to be no reason, ''the years . . . have no handles to grab onto.'' Nor does much else. Translated into an appropriately raw English by Mark Schafer (who also made the selections for this volume), the stories are bleak and unforgiving. People and events are presented without context, explanation or much connection to anything else. And the narrative itself is reduced to short bursts of language: barely linked sentences carry meanings that seem to evaporate even as they are read. What lingers and eventually dominates is the raw power of nature. ''The emptiness is immense,'' observes a man walking to his death in ''Bridge of Shadows,'' adding that ''God must not pass through these parts.'' The hugeness of the landscape belittles human efforts to make any sort of impression. This is an inexorable place. (''The cold was the kind that unfurls. That gains ground inch by inch.'') But also one of great and insoluble mystery. (''The silence of the night contains so many closets.'') The book's use of nature as its protagonist recalls the harsh fiction of Juan Rulfo, but Gardea includes subtle ironies and grace notes that are all his own. James Polk",1998-07-05T05:00:00+0000

A graduate of St. Joseph's College for Women, Brooklyn, and the New York University School of Law, Mrs. DuBois had a distinguished career. Over the past 14 years she became recognized as one of the leading philanthropic executives in the country. Until December, 1996, she was program vice president at the W.M. Keck Foundation, one of the nation's largest foundations. Since then she consulted with major institutions on their philanthropic strategy. Mrs. DuBois was responsible for the Keck Foundation's grant programs in medical research, law and its special Southern California Program. Her collaboration with Howard B. Keck, the Foundation's chairman during her tenure, resulted in the Foundation becoming a recognized national leader in philanthropy, benefiting medical research and legal education. During that time the medical research program focused on significant grants to major institutions with an emphasis on innovative research design in the fields of molecular biology and neuroscience. The Foundation's program in law produced a substantial body of work on legal ethics education during this period, and its Southern California program sought principally to benefit children in its grantmaking to education, the arts and health care. Earlier in her career, she was an attorney and planner for the Children's Defense Fund in New York and Cambridge, Mass. She was one of the original members of The Defense Fund and worked closely with the Hon. Justine Wise Polier and Marion Wright Edelman, the founders. Her work with the District of Columbia Committee of the House of Representatives resulted in the writing and passage of the first mandatory child abuse and neglect reporting law in the United States. That statute served as the model for the National Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Law which set up the National Center on Child Abuse within the DHEW. Active in community affairs, Mrs. DuBois was a sustaining member of the Junior League of Los Angeles and a member of The Blue Ribbon, a support group for the Music Center of Los Angeles County. She is survived by her husband, Peter, of Los Angeles, her parents, Benjamin and Agnes FitzGerald of Mendham, N.J., a sister, Eileen Sudler, also of Mendham, and 10 nieces and nephews.",1998-07-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Eight Sides to Everything,"No one's imagination survives entirely free after he has seen the glowing Castel del Monte in Apulia, in southeastern Italy -- a stupendous octagon with an octagonal tower at each of its eight corners. It is not the shape that is singular; many octagonal buildings date from late Roman times, and the interior of Charlemagne's chapel at Aachen is octagonal. But Castel del Monte is an intricate elaboration of eight-sided shapes multiplied in astonishing precision. It was built in the 13th century by Frederick II (1194-1250), the last Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperor and the most learned ruler of his time, who contributed to the design of many of the buildings he left behind. This one has long aroused speculation among historians, architects and archeologists. In CASTEL DEL MONTE: Geometric Marvel of the Middle Ages (Prestel/te Neues, $65), Heinz Gotze, a German archeologist, art historian and book publisher, summarizes the scholarship and uses his deep knowledge of history, architecture and mathematics, along with scores of mesmerizing pictures and diagrams, to advance his own persuasive theory. This is not casual reading -- that it could be clearly translated is impressive -- but close attention is richly rewarded, and anyone with a little geometry will be enchanted. Gotze demonstrates that the building draws on Gothic, Norman, Greek and Byzantine ideas, as one might expect, but also on the most powerful thinking about design and mathematics in the Islamic world. The ground plan, seen clearly in aerial shots of the citadel, perfectly illustrates all possible forms of an eight-sided polygon: four symmetrical axes, simple octagon, eight-pointed star formed by two intersecting squares and the pointed star polygon, universally known as the Islamic eight-pointed star. Castel del Monte is, as a computer simulation proves, a fractal whose iterations are immediately apparent -- one of the most beautiful structures ever to rise from the human mind, and the mind, recognizing it, is naturally captivated.

us,Science Fiction,"There is no finer writer of science fiction today than Kim Stanley Robinson, and he is at the top of his form in ANTARCTICA (Bantam, $24.95). The genesis of this novel was unusual. While researching his Mars trilogy, which concluded in 1996 with the masterly ''Blue Mars,'' he learned that scientists who study Mars often spend time in Antarctica because it is the part of Earth most like Mars. Within two weeks of completing his Mars trilogy, Robinson was off to Antarctica, courtesy of the National Science Foundation, which sponsors a program that sends artists and writers to the southernmost continent. The result is an exhilarating addition to a body of work distinguished by two elements all too rare in modern science fiction: a sense of character and a sense of place. Robinson brings the two together by writing about people who are in love with where they are. Appropriately enough, the book begins, ''First you fall in love with Antarctica, and then it breaks your heart.''",1998-07-12T05:00:00+0000

There's something odd about the subway car that Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospitals used to give a distinct New York flavor to this ad celebrating their partnership. The ad, which has been up for a month, was produced by an advertising agency whose staff looked through hundreds of stock photographs to find a representative example of a New York subway train. But Joseph P. Brennan, a rail buff who is a computer specialist at Columbia University, took a closer look after people began asking where that subway car was really from. His verdict: ''That's definitely not New York. It looks like the Chicago el.'' Sure enough, he found a Web site (http://members.aol.com/chictafan/p3200.jpg) where you can see a twin of this car. The billboard was scheduled to be up for six months, but now that word of Mr. Brennan's discovery is out, the ad will be replaced in a couple of weeks.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; They Failed Their Finals,"With DEFIANCE (Dutton, $23.95), Carole Maso, a professor of English at Brown University whose five previous books have involved large literary ambitions and small presses, makes a stab at luring a more mainstream audience. And ''stab'' is putting it mildly. The novel is the prison journal of Bernadette O'Brien, a Harvard physics professor who has sexually toyed with, then murdered, two male students. Bernadette has her reasons, and that, too, is putting it mildly. Chief among them are a grubby upbringing in Fall River, Mass., with parents who more or less prostitute themselves, and the victimization -- first by a pedophile priest, then by the Vietnam War -- of a beloved brother. Then there's the bad hair, the hobbled gait, the prodigious intelligence that make her a pariah until she sets her mind on a make-over and revenge. At first,''Defiance'' sounds like Fay Weldon without the jokes, but Bernadette is a fine monster in the prison-doll tradition, dishing out delightful contempt for the vicious society she believes she mimics, even the young men she so clinically seduces. She is, above all, a scientist, and in feverish, incantatory prose she sifts the shards of her past, trying to grasp the precise mechanics of class and sex that sealed her fate -- ''the click of the box,'' as she puts it. So relentless is her honesty that this hard-boiled book turns unexpectedly tender as Bernadette drops her monster mask -- her defiance -- to show the human face beneath.

Helen was the pillar of strength who guided and supported the outstanding careers of the late William, who was a highly regarded leading clinical investigator in hypertension and renal disease, and Roberta, who is an acclaimed, productive and respected clinician, investigator and teacher in pulmonary physiology, pathophysiology, and disease. Helen was the special role model who pursued excellence and made the name Goldring synonymous with excellence. She was the very proud and supportive spouse, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. She was the finest of the fine. We owe her a great deal for providing us with unique members of our alumni and faculty. She was the spouse of William; mother of Roberta and the late Nancy; mother-in-law of the late Dr. Robert Coles of our faculty and an alumnus of our School of Medicine (1945); grandmother of Deputy Mayor Anthony, John, an accomplished movie director, and sister, Dr. Nancy Coles Goldstein of our faculty, special alumnae (1985) and member of our Board of Governors; and great-grandmother of eight wonderful great-grandchildren. We express our deep sympathy to the entire family. Saul J. Farber, M.D., M.A.C.P. The Frederick H. King Professor & Chairman, Department of Medicine",1998-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Appearances aside, their great virtue was of a practical nature: back in the days when the crew of a ship scrubbed its decks in bare feet, bell-bottoms were easy to roll up above the ankle.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Alex Katz's Flat Farm,"To Alex Katz, the world is flat. At least that is how he has depicted it in his paintings since the late 1950's, when he first caught the attention of the art world. Katz stood out from the crowd by doing figural works with a twist: he painted recognizable subjects, but dramatically emphasized the flatness of the canvas with bold blocks of color and hard-edged contours. Certain elements of the large paintings -- the slightly irregular, squared-off faces of his portraits and the signature black swoop of hair on his wife, Ada -- have marked his works for 40 years, and are on display in the 213 illustrations contained in ALEX KATZ: A Retrospective (Abrams, $65), by Irving Sandler. Sandler, who teaches art history at the State University of New York, Purchase, knows Katz personally and has written about him before; this familiarity gives the book a justifiably assured tone. He classifies Katz as a ''modern dandy'' -- one who has coolly chronicled the changing style of his affluent circle at cocktail parties and summer homes, but in pared-down compositions that celebrate surface in a sophisticated way. ''Indeed, his work is distinguished by the grace with which he bridges representation and artifice,'' Sandler writes. Only his last chapter, detailing the fall and rise of realist painting and Katz's relation to it, might be considered a bit abstruse. As Katz's painting continues to evolve, most recently into the realm of landscape, this book helps us see the big picture. Ted Loos",1998-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; No Home Should Be Without It,"Written over the past four decades, the 19 stories in Kit Reed's WEIRD WOMEN, WIRED WOMEN (Wesleyan University/University Press of New England, cloth, $40; paper, $16.95) explore the changing circumstances of women's lives. Beauty pageants, hi-tech motherhood, fat farms, game shows -- nothing involved in shaping women's expectations is immune from her satiric scrutiny. Consumer products often provide flash points for fallacies in her characters' thinking. A mail-order device in ''The New You'' glamorizes Martha as promised, but the old, dumpy Martha accidentally survives to wander the house, sneaking food, sleeping in closets, ultimately stealing not only the old husband but an improved version as well. In ''Cynosure,'' Norma immobilizes her cat, dog and 10-year-old daughter with a vacuum-like appliance, the better to keep her house clean. Most of these stories shine with the incisive edginess of brilliant cartoons, though ''The Mothers of Shark Island'' and a few others are so dampened by bitterness that they fail to ignite. The best take the form of darkly comic rants by women who have too zealously pursued what they thought was happiness. While Reed calls these stories ''speculative fiction,'' they are less fantastic than visionary, uncovering humor and horror where others have seen only clothes, make-up and recipes snipped from the newspaper.

Shaped like a lizard, they come with a slimy texture in colors like Yellerbelly inside a package that features a Clinton caricature and a flirty fish.

The patchwork shades of green covering the slopes, as you come closer, turn out to be immense reforestation projects in various stages of growth. Logging is an important part of the history of this island, as it is of all of British Columbia, and some of these giant forests of ancient cedar, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce were cut in the late 19th century. Other sections along the highway were logged as recently as the early 1990's. The new trees, and those from the 40's and 50's that are now imposing evergreens, are posted with neat company signs giving the reforestation dates.

''It looks like the kind of crowd you'd see at an art opening,'' Ms. Dell said. But the throng on the sidewalk was not spilling out of a gallery; it was milling around NoLIta's most popular hole in the wall: the small window cut out of Ciao Bella, a factory at 262 Mott Street, which has been shipping malted-milk-ball ice cream, strawberry-rhubarb sorbet and 82 other exotic flavors to the Rainbow Room, the Lobster Club, Nobu and top restaurants around the country since 1991. ''The neighborhood has sprung up around the factory,'' said F. W. Pierce, an owner. Three years ago, when the sleepy neighborhood began to boom with sidewalk traffic, he blasted an opening through which he could sell directly to passers-by. Though Ciao Bella has since opened two retail stores in New York, the crowds still seem to prefer the factory.

Inside his school's assembly hall, a photographic portrait of Theodore Roosevelt stared down at him (''There was America, I thought, the real America''); outside an old police station on East New York Avenue, Kazin would daydream of the 1880's, certain that Roosevelt himself, back then the Police Commissioner, would momentarily come bounding down the steps. Years later, his literary ambitions aflame, Kazin stood on the corner of Fulton and Cranberry Streets, in front of the place where Walt Whitman himself had printed ''Leaves of Grass,'' ''thinking that I had at last opened the great trunk of forgotten time in New York in which I, too, I thought, would someday find the source of my unrest.''",1998-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Beloved husband of Celia Deming Munson. Father of Marjorie Smith Munson and Jane Rust Munson Harrison, stepfather of Sharon Harts Wick and Deanne Harts Mallory, and grandfather of Timothy Laurel and Chauncey Rachael Sherwood Harrison. Mr. Munson was educated at the Taft School, after which he graduated with a BA from Yale. While at Yale, he was captain of the golf team, member of St. Elmo and President of the Intercollegiate Golf Association of America. In 1938 he attended Cambridge University and was a member of the Hawk's Club. From 1939-1944, he served as a Lt. Commander in the United States Navy during WW II in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean theaters. Upon his return to the US, he worked at Vanadium Corp. as the assistant to the president until 1949 when he contracted polio. Although the wheelchair was the first thing that you saw, it was the last thing that you remembered. He faced this challenge head-on and remained fully active and committed to whatever he chose to accomplish. In 1953, he became a director of American European Securities Co., one of the first funds to combine European and American equity holdings. At that time, he was also a director at Reinsurance Corp. of America. In 1952, he was elected director of the Westport Bank and Trust, and the Connecticut New York Broadcasting Corp. In 1954, he was made a director at Baldwin-United Corporation. In 1959, he was promoted to the position of president of American European Securities, a post he held until 1972 when the company was sold. He also served as a director of the Eaton Corporation (1963-1981), Marine Midland Bank (1970-1982), Michigan Gas Utilities Co., and Baxter International, Inc. (1979-1990). In his retirement, Mr. Munson was the treasurer of the Hobe Sound Community Chest, a beloved volunteer teacher at the Hobe Sound Elementary School and a member of the board of directors of Planned Parenthood of the Palm Beach and Treasure Coast area. He was a member of The Links, Jupiter Island Club and past president of the Hobe Sound Yacht Club and The Country Club of Fairfield. His many published letters to newspaper editors served as a lesson to us all -''When we disagree, we should let it be known.'' A private memorial service will be held on July 24th, in Southport with burial in Woodbury, CT.

It's not the song she's talking about; it's the name of the treatment for the area around the eyes that she gets regularly at Haven, a spa at 150 Mercer Street (Houston and Prince Streets) in SoHo. ''I look at people's eyes all day long, and it's an area where people hold stress,'' she said. ''I never leave the house without makeup, but after this treatment I felt like all the age and the stress and the puffiness just melted away.'' The 45-minute procedure includes three types of massage around the eyes -- shiatsu, European massage and manual lymphatic drainage -- as well as a skin peel and herbal moisturizers. Gabrielle Ophals and Audra Senkus opened Haven two months ago to focus on facial treatments. ''American women are finally considering a facial part of regular maintenance, and along with this growing trend women want specialty treatments,'' Ms. Ophals said. For $50, it's an eye-opener.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Reconstructing Soutine,"Sleek museum halls may represent, in effect, the rich and complex fruits of an artist's life arranged into neatly hung and clearly labeled rows. An Expressionist in Paris: The Paintings of Chaim Soutine (Prestel/Te Neues, $65) goes far to do the reverse; it attempts to return the artist and his work to their vital place in history. Born in 1893 to poor Orthodox Jews in a village near Minsk, Soutine came of age while pogroms swept Russia. From the age of 20, when he arrived in Paris on the eve of World War I, to his death in 1943 while hiding from Nazi forces in an occupied France, he practiced a particularly frenetic and unsettlingly morbid breed of Expressionism: landscapes so laden with paint the canvases themselves seem overgrown, portraits in which the subjects' faces seem to dissolve, still lifes with sides of beef dripping with blood. Yet the focus of the 10 essays in this book rests not so much on Soutine's paintings as on how little else he left behind. He did not sketch; he left few photographs and even fewer letters. The achievement of ''An Expressionist in Paris'' ultimately lies in its elegant manipulation of the various forms of secondhand testimony with which we can make up for that dearth -- the criticism, the myths, the anecdotes, the sales and exhibition records. Through such meticulously researched works of scholarship as Kenneth E. Silver's informative profile of the artistic, critical, religious and political climates during Soutine's career and Colette Giraudon's exhaustive delineation of Soutine's market, the painter himself remains a silent, phantasmal figure that must be reconstituted from the fragments. And the image that does resolve itself inevitably brings with it a sense of irretrievable loss. Christina Cho",1998-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Their persuasiveness takes the form of a television commercial they made at Three Bridges School in Hunterdon County. They had help, from Barbara Perchaluk, an executive at the Gianettino & Meredith advertising agency in Short Hills, who is the aunt of James Sullivan, one of the students. She guided the students in conceiving an imaginary product -- a big football containing two smaller ones -- and forming groups to handle such tasks as copywriting, wardrobe, story board production and painting backgrounds. The result, finished last month, is an upbeat minute of children tossing a football around the world (with plenty of special effects) and a catchy jingle. The project was meant to illustrate logical thinking, communication and teamwork. What the student's didn't need was an introduction to the main concept.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Too Late to Live,"In a sharp break from the wry humor of her best-selling Adrian Mole diaries, Sue Townsend's novel GHOST CHILDREN (Soho, $22) uses an obsessive, desperate romance to address such complex issues as abortion and child abuse. In a macabre early scene, Christopher Moore -- middle-aged, unemployed and socially isolated -- discovers a dumped bag of aborted fetuses and, like a demented Silas Marner, takes one home until it decomposes. This strange act prompts him to search out Angela Lowood, nee Carr, with whom he had a youthful love affair until she aborted their out-of-wedlock child. His obsession with this lost child casts a foreboding shadow over his attempts to win Angela back, and also colors his chance dealings with Crackle and Tamara, a grubby young couple who live in a housing project, and their infant daughter, Storme. What Christopher hardly suspects, and Townsend unflinchingly depicts, is the cycle of abuse that will put Storme in the hospital even as Christopher is re-establishing his relationship with Angela. Now morbidly obese and married to a cold, class-conscious and sexually frustrated businessman named Gregory, Angela is also haunted by the past. And her daydreams -- sometimes near-hallucinations -- of a perfect daughter only sharpen the poignancy of the wasted years as she tries to change her life. Never casting judgment on Angela and Gregory or Crackle and Tamara, Townsend moves with assurance and cold irony from the gentle satire of her previous books into grim social drama. Even at its bleakest, ''Ghost Children'' displays her talent for getting inside her characters' minds -- though they are far less pleasant to inhabit than young Adrian Mole's.

To be sure, the composer of ''Duplicates'' had long since stopped playing jazz by the time he collected his prize. But Powell, who worked with Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller in the 1940's, was for a brief time among the best-known big-band sidemen in America, and when he died on April 24, jazz connoisseurs mourned him not as a relatively obscure composer of nontonal classical music, but as one of the most underrated pianists of the swing era.",1998-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Lueken died in 1995, and her followers split into factions that feuded over control. One, headed by her husband, Arthur, won a court battle and kept the Lueken name.

Another can has a space where a drinker can write his name, address and phone number -- in case the can gets lost. Some cans note, ''Not every can of Miller Lite contains the same number of bubbles.'' The arch labeling is pitched to the postcollegiate crowd, beer-drinkers weaned on Lettermanesque humor. It is the Miller Brewing Company's response to a flatness in sales, said Gina Shaffer, marketing communications manager for Miller Lite in Milwaukee. She said the labeling is ''focused on 21- to 28-year-olds.'' Miller Lite, introduced in 1975, had its peak year in 1990, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketers Insight, an industry newsletter. A six-pack of 12-ounce cans is $4.50.
