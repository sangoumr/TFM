us,Film: 'Crossed Swords':Shades of Twain,"""CROSSED SWORDS"" has many things going for it. It's based on Mark Twain's classic, ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" about the mad mix-up that ensues when a 10-year-old London beggar boy and his look-alike, Prince Edward, the son of Henry VIII, change places, the one to stand the court on its ear, the other to learn the bitter facts of life in Tudor England.The movie contains some stunning views of English palaces and country-sides, a lot of swordplay and its fair share of grandly fruity lines, such as the one spoken when Henry (Charlton Heston) finds the pauper hiding in his garden and steps on the boy's back. The boy cries out, ""What?"" bellows Henry. ""Is the weight of England too heavy for you? I've carried it for these 5 and 30 years!""When I was two-and-eight, I loved this kind of dialogue, though I was puzzled. Why did kings always say, ""these 5 and 30 years""? Why not ""these 10 and 25 years,"" or even ""these 17 and 18 years""? No matterstyle was the thing.Style is not something that ""Crossed Swords"" is exactly burdened with, though the movie comes to life every time Rex Harrison, as the fastidious, wiley, Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk, makes his amused way across the screen, or when George C. Scott turns up briefly, but hilariously, as a snaggle-toothed bandit chief named the Ruffler, an ex-monk with a tendency to talk as if all speech were a Gregorian chant.The most notable thing about the filmand something that might guarantee its place in the history bookshas nothing to do with the esthetics of popular cinema, but with the fact it opens today at Radio City Music Hall and will probably be the last movie to play that most extraordinary of all picture palaces. The hall may well survive, but not as we've known it for the last 45 years.""Crossed Swords"" is not an inappropriate choice to receive this distinction. Though it is rated PG, it recalls the kind of romantic-adventure fiction that distinguished one of Hollywood's several golden ages and that served well the patrons of the Music Hall. I emphasize, however, that ""Crossed Swords"" only recalls those earlier times. It doesn't re-create them. It's a far cry from the sort of 1930's movie that starred Errol Flynn and presented great character actors such as Henry Stephenson, Halliwell Hobbes, Claude Rains and Montagu Love, who made the 1937 version of ""The Prince and The Pauper"" so entertaining.""Crossed Swords"" is vastly more elaborate and more expensive than that film, but it doesn't have its simplicity of spirit or even its know-how. Instead of the young Mauch brothers, the identical twins who played the title roles, it has an 18-year-old Mark Lester, who was such a steadfast little Oliver in ""Oliver"" 10 years ago, as both the prince and the pauper.I suppose the argument is that an older pair of heroes will attract a more sophisticated audience to ""Crossed Swords,"" but Mr. Lester, now so long of limb as well as of tooth, simply looks silly in the roles. The readings are still those of a child actor and do not fit his physique. It's a comment on the age in which we live to be required to say of an 18-year-old actor: he hasn't aged especially well.As Miles Hendon, the soldier-of-fortune who befriends the prince on his travels around the kingdom, Oliver Reed makes every attempt to overwhelm the part and the movie. Mr. Reed's intensity as an actor is intended, I assume, to come across as character conviction, but the result is a kind of scary, humorless self-absorption. There's no sense of fun in the performance.There's somewhat more fun in the performance of Raquel Welch, as the woman Miles Hendon loves, if only because it's fun to see her in such costume spectacles as she exposes a perfectly straight face and a lot of well-tanned cleavage. Ernest Borgnine plays the pauper's vicious old dad as if Fatso Judson (of ""From Here to Eternity"") had awakened in Tudor London, which is not at all bad. There is also an attractive supporting performance by Lalla Ward as the self-possessed, opinionated little princess who later became Elizabeth I.Though the screenplay by George MacDonald Fraser seems to dawdle a lot, the direction of Richard Fleischer is much of the time paralyzed with indecision. Is ""Crossed Swords"" supposed to be funny or is it supposed to be an all-out adventure? The Old London sets are splendid, but the atmosphere is as tepid and unconvincing as that of a road-company operetta. When Mr. Fleischer cross-cuts between two lines of action, he has a unique way of cutting suspense in half instead of doubling it.There aren't so many costume films that one can easily dismiss ""Crossed Swords."" Yet one keeps wanting it to be better than it ever could be, given these circumstances.""Crossed Swords,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), including some rough-and-tumble fight scenes, but nothing as blood-curdling as an average child's everyday nightmare.",1978-03-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Harvey Keitel in 'Fingers':Petulant Nuisance,"JIMMY ANGELELLI, the hypersensitive hero of ""Fingers,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema 2, is a man who has no frieends and who doesn't deserve any. For one thing, Jimmy is too busy pacing, brooding, pouncing, snarling and having inexplicable conniptions to have time for much of a social life. For another, he isn't the sort of fellow who'll allow anyone to get very close to him.We know this, and a lot of other things about Jimmy, courtesy of his portable tape deck, which he carries with him everywhere (because it puts up a kind of wall between him and the rest of the world), and which he uses to play both classical music and 50's rock-and-roll (Jimmy's is a divided nature). He even turns on the machine in restaurants, in scenes that mean to establish him as a desperately insecure figure but instead make him out to be a public nuisance.""Fingers"" marks the directional debut of the screenwriter James Toback (""The Gambler""), who exhibits a fatal fascination with Jimmy's every petulant quirk. Mr. Toback, having created a character whose intrinsic charm plus 50 cents would only barely get him onto the subway, seems incapable of putting his hero in any kind of dramatic perspective, and he is apparently unwilling to explore him in terms more intimate than those of an introductory psychology course. Jimmy's mother was a musician and his father is a boorish gangster; his mother resents him bitterly and his father wishes he'd strangled him in his crib. No wonder the kid's got a headache.Many of Jimmy's troubles revolve around sex, to which he devotes himself far too selflessly, according to his doctor (if this isn't the only movie to show someone having his prostate examined, it ought to be). Jimmy is obsessively entangled with a strange, elusive, mysterious girl (Tisa Farrow) who is so spitefully uncommunicative that one begins wanting, in the spirit of the movie, to give her a good belt. Jimmy's machismohe tries to castrate a rival, thinks women are sexier without birth controlis enough to make Tarzan blush.Mr. Toback favors a stiff, staccato, nervous style of direction that's heavy on the hocus-pocus and low on verisimilitude or insight. Aiming for a mood of nightmarish abstraction, he borders all too often on jumpy incompetence. Although the film's production credits are impressivethe cinematographer from ""Taxi Driver,"" the production designer from ""Three Days of the Condor,"" the costume designer for ""Next Stop, Greenwich Village""and suggest that the film ought to have a good feeling for New York, it contains moments of surprising amateurishness. The sets look uninhabitable and the sound mixing is particularly appalling: A phone in the back of a restaurant rings at top volume, and the music sounds equally scratchy whether it's coming from a tape deck or a concert piano.Perhaps this should have been the movie to establish Harvey Keitel as a leading man of depth and versatility, but Mr. Keitel's performance as Jimmy only underscores Mr. Toback's skittishness. The screenplay draws Jimmy's character in such rudimentary terms that Mr. Keitel might have breathed a little healthy confusion into the role by playing against it. Instead, he does little more than illustrate Mr. Toback's points with a textbook tidiness, turning each scene into a virtual exercise. The part of Jimmy on which Mr. Keitel concentrates most avidly is, you guessed it, his fingers, whether Jimmy is working as a loan collector in his father's employ or a pianist in his mother's shadow. Not since Captain Queeg have a character's hands done so much restless wiggling and tapping.Mr. Keitel, as always, gives an impression of earnestness and dedication, but everyone else in the film appears to be in a big hurry to get to his or her lunch date. Miss Farrow is lovely to watch, but she gives a performance of such low wattage she barely seems plugged in; Marian Seldes and Michael V. Gazzo, as Jimmy's parents, suggest that Mr. Toback doesn't believe there's any such thing as overacting.Jim Brown, as the only real sex object in the movie (he's the only character who doesn't wear underwear), has the film's most, memorably silly moment, in which he smacks two women's heads together because they don't want to kiss each other. This episode, intended as a kind of taunt to Jimmy, is only one of many things in the film that only Mr. Toback could, or would want to, understand.",1978-03-03T05:00:00+0000

Lefkowitz was a spindly 23-year-old from New York's Lower East Side when he first went to Albany in 1927 as an unknown Republican member of the Assembly in a town dominated by the Democratic Governor, Alfred E. Smith. By the time he announced last week that he would not seek re-election as Attorney General, he had served in various offices under both Democratic and Republican administrations and was among the state's betterknown politicians. Mr. Lefkowitz first became Attorney General by appointment to succeed to Jacob K. Javits, who had been elected a United States Senator, but after nearly 22 years in the job the Lefkowitz name has become almost synonomous with the office. One reason for that was his close relationship with Nelson A. Rockefeller, starting from Mr. Rockefeller's first campaign for the governorship. He still says I'm predjudiced for Rockefeller. But equally important was his pursuit of his populist beliefs in a carefully cultivated nonpartisan fashion that won him the unofficial titles of grandfather of the consumerprotection movement and the people's lawyer. Mr. Lefkowitz will remain on the job until his successor is chosen and as in the past he intends to pursue his career vigorously. I'm still on the payroll, he said.

He had, he said, personally supervised the entire K.G.B. file on Lee Harvey Oswald and therefore knew everything there was to know about the alleged assassin's relationship with Soviet intelligence. He wanted to defect and he wanted to talk. The C.I.A. promptly brought him to the United States, where he has been ever since. Now, under a new name, Nosenko lives a life of affluence and influence in North Carolina, courtesy of the C.I.A. The agency bought him a house, found him a job and pays him an annual allowance of $30,000. In return, he keeps his mouth shut. He also acts as a consultant for the agency and the F.B.I. in counterintelligence matters relating to the Soviet Union. Some current but mostly former members of the C.I.A. consider this state of affairs a travesty and tragic. But, as Edward Jay Epstein tells it in this fascinating, alarming and perhaps enormously significant book, Nosenko has been a source of profound controversy within the Government for a long time.",1978-03-05T05:00:00+0000

He confesses that he has another woman, another life he wants to go to, and he feels so miserable about everything he's shocked when you don't sympathize.In Paul Mazursky's new comedy, ""An Unmarried Woman,"" about America's dangerously mobile, just-this-side-of-rootless middle class, Erica (Jill Clayburgh) gets bloody mad. She stalks off alone down the street, throws up in a trash basket and, when she at last lets the news sink in, starts to cry in fury, surprise, hurt and fear.As Miss Clayburgh plays this scene, one has a vision of all the immutable things that can be destroyed in less than a minute, from landscapes and ships and reputations to perfect marriages. The scene is beautifully written by Mr. Mazursky. It is high comedy of a sharp, bitter kind, and Michael Murphy is fine as the weasel husband named Martin, but Miss Clayburgh is nothing less than extraordinary in what is the performance of the year to date. In her we see intelligence battling feelingreason backed against the wall by pushy needs.In the succeeding weeks, Erica begins to cope. Daily routine helps. She has her job in a SoHo art gallery. She has her teen-age daughter and her women friends, some of whom are in worse shape than she is. One night she gets out of bed and systematically throws out Martin's shaving gear, golf clubs and Adidas sneakers. For a while Erica also has a woman therapist who makes her feel better by appearing serenely understanding (and a tiny bit smug) as she repeats to Erica truisms that can be very comforting to the deeply distressed.""An Unmarried Woman,"" which opens today at the Beekman, Paramount and Murray Hill Theaters, is Mr. Mazursky's most ambitious movie so far, and the first film to put Miss Clayburgh's talents to full use. She was charming in ""Semi-Tough,"" but otherwise she's had to wade around in things such as ""The Silver Streak"" and ""Gable and Lombard,"" pretending that mud puddles are swimming pools.Mr. Mazursky has written a marvelous role for the actress, so I suppose it's not unfair of him to depend on her to carry the movie, which is ultimately not as tough and funny and critical as it is in individual moments. Because Mr. Mazursky has such a sharp eye for the essential props of a certain kind of American life, and because he has an ear for the way people talk, one expects him to be a more merciless social satirist than he has any intention of being.In his best films, ""Blume in Love"" and ""Harry and Tonto,"" as in the supposedly elegiacal ""Next Stop Greenwich Village,"" he inevitably chooses the sentimental over the satiric, which one could defend as his right if he weren't so effective in portraying the essential foolishness of a plastic society. It's as if he couldn't restrain his affection for people and thing that, as he shows them to us, aren't worth it. Specific scenes in ""An Unmarried Woman"" come across in sharp focus, but the overall view is as soft and fuzzy as something photographed through gauze.This is especially apparent in the new film after he has introduced us to Erica and her ""problem,"" and after we witness her first desperate, comic attempts to liberate herself sexually (with an egocentric Village painter, nicely played by Cliff Gorman). Erica doesn't flounder for long. She meets Mr. Right in the form of an English artist (Alan Bates), who's so manly, wise, affectionate and dependable that he seems to be out of ""The Sleeping Beauty.""The final quarter of the movie gives the impression not of having been written, directed and acted, but of a tone poem that's been scored with slushv music and paced with swoony camera shots, thus to suggest an alternate title, ""An Unmarried Man and A Woman.""The way the film evolves should not be a complete surprise, I suppose, because in the earlier sequences one is always aware of the sort of romantic method by which scenes must begin with images as seen through mirrors, a device that is even more boring than the freeze-frame, which he also uses.Mr. Mazursky is a writer-director of such real abilities that we've the right to demand that he be better. He's fine with his actors (though Mr. Bates's role is no challenge to an exceptional actor) and he has the potential of a great satirst. It's as if he were afraid to let himself go because he wouldn't please enough people. He attempts to soothe when he should scratch.",1978-03-05T05:00:00+0000

Its purpose is to set in a new light the relations between those ideas and the radical thought  political, moral and theological  of Milton's extremist contemporaries.

Christopher Hill is our foremost authority on their thinking, of which we have a much clearer idea since the publication of his book The World Turned Upside Down. In fact, as he tells us, Mr. Hill found in his study of these fascinating enthusiasts the starting point of his new book: I came to my version of Milton through a long period in the company of Seekers, Ranters, early Quakers and other new notionists the late sixteenforties and early fifties.",1978-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Triangle Gets a Twist In 'Furtivos',"There is a familiar-sounding romantic triangle in ""Furtivos,"" involving a man, his sweetheart and his terribly chagrined old mother, but the Spanish director Jos Luis Borau chooses to present the situation in an exeedingly unfamiliar way.The mother lives quietly in an isolated cottage, where the woods are full of wolves and the provincial governor makes special visits just to sample her stew. But when her sad-eyed son comes home, madly in love with a thirtyish-looking woman who says she is a reform-school runaway, the mother's life is disrupted.In fact, the son is so bent on making his lover feel at home that one night he drags his mother from her own bed, screaming, so that he and his paramour can cuddle in comfort. The mother is so vexed by this, and so without effective recourse, that she stalks out to one of her wolf traps and takes out her rage on a hapless creature that has the ill fortune to be caught there.This episode takes place in the evening but many of the eeriest moments in ""Furtivos,"" at the Cinema Studio, are set in brilliant sunlight and sparkle with disconcertingly deadpan humor; it's no wonder that the film has been advertised as a favorite of Luis Buuel.Mr. Borau, whose work has apparently been both popular and controversial in Spain (though it is new to American audiences), has a talent for shifting things ever so slightly askew, without sacrificing the air of oppressive normality that gives his best scenes a subversive vitality. In his most sharply successful moments, Mr. Borau manages to get things so wrong that they seem just right.So when the governor makes one of his periodic stew stops at this rude cottage in the forest, he brings a little chandelier as a bread-and-butter present. And when the runaway interrupts her truffle-gathering and dismisses her pig so she can seduce the sad-eyed son (now her sad-eyed husband) in the forest, who should appear on a motorcycle but her former boyfriend, a desperado who has come to find her.The newlyweds just stand there, as the desperado circles around and around and never quite seems to notice them. Rather than being irritated by the interruption, they seem quite impressed, even mystified, by the outlaw's peculiar timing.There is a marvelous spirit of mischief to Mr. Borau's work, and an unusual delicacy to his gift for making things seem daintily unhinged; the most enduring image presented by this handsome, impressively single-minded movie is that of an exquisitely serene autumnal forest with countless animal traps beneath the leaves.Mr. Borau, who begins the film with Franco's statement that ""Spain is a peaceful forest,"" is better able to suggest subversion visually than he is through more pointedly political plot elements, such as the reformatory, the renegade, or the sad-eyed man's illegal poaching of the governor's game. And, in fact, the boldness of such ingredients tends to overwhelm the understated rebelliousness at which the film otherwise hints so ably.""The climate of oppression that the film means to dramatize is important, but what makes Mr. Borau's American debut particularly auspicious is not his film's subject but its muted, idiosyncratic and altogether clear-eyed madness.",1978-03-07T05:00:00+0000

""A Little Night Music,"" the Broadway musical adaptation of the Bergman film, directed by Harold Prince, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim at his best, sent one out of the theater feeling in top form.It's something more than a shock, then, that the film adaptation of the Broadway show not only fails to raise the spirits; it also tramples on them. The more kindly disposed will leave the theater depressed, a lot of others may be in a rage. Though it's possible to fail with intelligence and grace, the movie, which opens today at Columbia 1, pursues disaster in the manner of someone who, with mindless self-confidence, saws off the limb he's sittin on.Perhaps the movie's worst sin is to make the critic feel he must play the role of the piously aggrieved scoutmaster, who has to say a lot of boring, obvious thingsin this case about the difference between the stage and movies. These are things that Mr. Prince, who also directed the movie, and Hugh Wheeler, who wrote the screenplay from his own Broadway book, certainly know from experience that is more practical than most critics will ever have. The way they have made the movie, it looks like a publicly posted suicide pact. Such a succession of mistakes can't be accidental.The Broadway show, like the Bergman film, is a wickedly lyric rondel, a romantic, turn-of-the-century masquerade about three mismatched couples who, in the course of a limpid summer night, on a magnificent country estate, more or less stumble into perfect happiness.They are a beautiful, worldly actress of certain years (Elizabeth Taylor), her lover, a foolish hussar (Laurence Guittard), the hussar's jealous wife (Diana Rigg), the wife's school friend (Lesley-Ann Down), whose much older husband (Len Cariou) loves the actress and whose stepson (Christopher Guard) loves his stepmother.Looking on are the actress's ancient mother (Hermione Gingold), herself once a famous courtesan, and the actress's daughter (Chloe Franks), plus one lively, pretty maid (Lesley Dunlop), without whom no farce can be complete.The sum and substance of the show are not the characters but Mr. Sondheim's music and lyrics. They describe the awful and funny torments of hearts that rule minds of the size and consistency of baby peas. It's not exactly a problem play. It's Mozartean comedy in which stylized settings, costumes and even lighting create a world of sweet timelessness.Having elected to transform the Sondheim show into a film, Mr. Prince appears to have made every decision that could sabotage the music and the lyrics. He has cast the film with people who don't sing very well and then staged almost every number in such a way that we can't respond to the lyrics.He often photographs the singers in those blandly uninformative close-ups that force us to consider hairlines, necklines and lip-sync techniques.Mr. Sondheim's marvelous two-and three-part songs, in which characters, often in different settings, share their sentiments, work on the stage since the characters are enclosed by the same proscenium. In the movie, which is set in elegant but realistic locations, these numbers require all sorts of busy cross-cutting that upstages the music, which becomes as effectively fragmented as the images.It is, of course, possible to hear the songs, but in this movie it seems like-work. ""Send in the Clowns"" will survive Miss Taylor's game way with a lyric, and so will ""You Must Meet My Wife"" (Miss Taylor and Mr. Cariou), but ""A Little Night Music"" shouldn't be a matter of survival. It should be ebullient and fun. It isn't. It often seems to be mean-tempered.There's no reason why Miss Taylor should be photographed so unflatteringly (unless she gave the orders), or that Lesley-Ann Down and Diana Rigg should appear at times in flesh colors of grayish-green (at least in the print I saw).Someone should also have had the decency to blip out a word in one of the lyrics that gets a cruel laugh in the way it refers to Miss Taylor, who is an actress of more wit and character than ""A Little Night Music"" ever allows.So are Miss Down and Miss Rigg, though they, and Miss Taylor and Mr. Cariou do have one very funny scene. It's a dinner table scene in which everything goes wrong and no one is required to sing.Of the actors, Mr. Cariou is the only one who registers as a character. The others are animated mannequins. Hermione Gingold, re-creating her Broadway role, gets short shrift from the film, which even nips off her last scene, though that may be just as well. It's become increasingly apparent that less of Miss Gingold is moreand sometimes too much.""A Little Night Music,"" which has been rated PG A ""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a couple of love scenes that are less heated than jurious in the way of farce.",1978-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Wounded Sub:Gray Lady Down,"""GRAY LADY DOWN,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is this year's model of your standard peacetime submarine melodrama which is not about a confrontation between navies but about one with the element through which the submarine moves.In the first scene of ""Gray Lady Down,"" the nuclear-powered United States Navy submarine Neptune surfaces in a fog off Cape Cod and is immediately rammed by a Norwegian freighter. The damaged Neptune sinks to a precarious position on a sea shelf 1,400 feet below, and for the next 100 or so minutes we are asked to wonder whether Charlton Heston, the skipper, and his ethnically balanced crew are going to be saved.The fact that ""Gray Lady Down"" was made with the enthusiastic cooperation of the Navy may give you a clue. The Navy seldom looks on the dark side of things, especiallly itself. ""Gray Lady Down"" has about it a sort of capitalistic sunniness, best summed up when, just after the wounded sub has come to rest on the ocean bottom, a scared sailor says, ""Thank God."" Says Chuck Heston, ""Thank God and General Dynamics.""The movie also takes care to reassure us that even though the tremendous sea pressure may eventually crush the ship's hull. There's absolutely no danger that the ship's nuclear power-pack will pollute the seas. In a world where all is change, it's reassuring to know that one thing will last forever.""Gray Lady Down"" is somewhat less enduring, though it seems endless. It's been composed with its crises so evenly spaced that you ache for a station break bracketed by commercials. Will that bulkhead hold? Mercy me, it's starting to leak! The oxygen supply is giving out. Will Captain Bennett (Stacy Keach), the man in charge of the rescue (and an old friend of Chuck's), get the undersea rescue vessel to the doomed sub before the crew has the fatal vapors? Do you doubt it?The people who appear in movies like that don't act. They display various cuts of resolve and steadfastness as if they were male models. The Navy is so particular about the men it lets into the sub service, you may also rest assured that when the Neptune's executive officer, played by Ronny Cox, has a brief, neurotic temper tantrum, he will recoup his reputation by making the sacrifice sometimes called supreme. David Carradine attemptsand failsto give some individuality to his role, that of a idiosyncratic officer who has invented an experimental undersea craft.The screenplay, which is terrible, was directed by David Greene, who directed the first segment of ""Roots"" and other television shows. Considering the material, he seems to be an efficient fellow.""Gray Lady Down,"" (which has been rated PG (""Parental Guildance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language.",1978-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Gunnel Lindblom's 'Summer Paradise',"The weather is perfect, the wild flowers are in bloom, and the old house is so spacious that everyone has his or her own prettily wallpapered room, but all is not right in the film ""Summer Paradise""or at least it's not supposed to be. The middle-class extended family that spends its yearly vacations at this idyllic retreat is meant to seem much too complacent for its own good and for anyone else's.As the director Gunnel Lindblom sees it, the ills of the world don't intrude enough to spoil these merry Swedes' good time, and whenever anyone has a bad dream, Grandma, who is a physician, merely prescribes sleeping pills. The family takes its greatest satisfactions in the lake, the flowerbeds and the freshly baked bread.Naturally enough, there are a few termites in the woodwork: The women are lonely, the men are weaklings, and the children are growing up without proper supervision. These things are pointed out by great-grandpa and by grandma's social-worker friend, older people who are wise enough to realize that subsequent generations have gotten further and further out of line. ""It's a disgrace to be a human being today, woman,"" says the social worker at last, in a rather blunt and unconvinicing moment of pique.Miss Lindblom, an actress who worked with Ingmar Bergman in films such as ""The Seventh Seal"" and ""Wild Strawberries."" fills ""Summer Paradise"" with hints of trouble and indications that a great deal is being swept under the rug. However, she never manages to suggest that the family genuinely gives a hoot about any of this, and the film's glimpses of bourgeois guilt are singularly unaffecting. When unrest finally does burst forth at the end of the story, it comes as a bolt out of the much-too-blue sky.Miss Lindblom's point may very well be that people who live life too comfortably aren't even capable of intelligent or moving regret, but that's a poor premise on which to construct a drama; she winds up with two hours' worth of ripples in the water and not a single wave.She also has a tendency to undercut her own points through overemphasis: A lower class mother and son, very conspicuous brunettes in a sea of blondes, are treated with wildly exaggerated rudeness by the others. When, at the end of the film, the little boy sits dejectedly on the lawn, Miss Lindblom photographs him in the foreground of a larger shot, then makes the point in the closeup, and then in even closer closeup than that.Miss Lindblom gets some vivid characterizations out of a distinguished Swedish cast, and she is particularly successful in presenting scenes between lovers with an equal appreciation of male and female sensuality.But there is no sense of real darkness beneath the film's patently artificial light, and the viewer is finally swamped by those very same middle-class amenities that Miss Lindblom means to deplore. One does wind up feeling sick to death of nice-looking people with nicely manageable problems, but that's apparently only half of what Miss Lindblom had in mind.",1978-03-12T05:00:00+0000

He was not a giant, to my surprise, but a broad man, diminished by age to little taller than myself. Through the next years the white hair thinned more, the body hunched and faltered.

us,Film: De Palma Mixes Genres in 'Fury':Psyching a Spy,"""TELEPATHY,"" someone says solemnly in ""The Fury"" is a timeless form of communication to which Woody Allen (were he around) might add with equal solemnity, ""and far cheaper than Western Union.""""The Fury,"" which opens today at the National, Cine and other theaters, was directed by Brian De Palma in what appears to have been an all-out effort to transform the small-scale, Grand Guignol comedy of his ""Carrie"" into an international horror/spy/occult mind-blower of a movie. He didn't concentrate hard enough, though. ""The Fury"" is bigger than ""Carrie,"" more elaborate, much more expensive and far sillier. Let's face itit's the De Palma ""1900""a movie that somehow got out of hand.It's also, in fits and starts, the kind of mindless fun that only a horror movie that so seriously pretends to be about the mind can be. Mr. De Palma seems to have been less interested in the overall movie than in pulling off a couple of spectacular set-pieces, which he does. He leaves the rest of ""The Fury"" to take care of itself.The John Farris screenplay, though based on a published novel, has the air of something that hasn't been thought clearly through, or at least thought through to the point where basic plot questions don't distract us from enjoying a line like, ""I'm just a receiver and Robin sends me pictures.""The girl who says this is one of the two doomed young people who possess the power, like that of the heroine of ""Carrie,"" to move objects through force of will. They also are able to communicate, telepathically, to share memories with someone unknown, to detonate things and to bring on cerebral hemorrhages at random. The film's pathology is as confused as the story, so one spends most of ""The Fury"" impatiently anticipating the next demonstration of something that one keeps hoping will be unspeakable but never is.In particular, ""The Fury"" is about Peter Sanza (Kirk Douglas), an American superagent whose son, a fellow with psychic powers, is abducted from an Israeli beach by one of Peter's colleagues, apparently for the exclusive use of the United States Government.For most of the film, Peter searches vainly for the young man (why he had to be abducted is never made clear), the trail eventually taking him to Chicago and to a mysterious ""institute"" where the psychically gifted are studied. There Peter finds not his son, but a young woman named Gillian (Amy Irving) who is in thought communication with the son.The story is too witless to bear more scrutiny than that. The things that keep one sitting through ""The Fury"" when one's mind knows better are the occasional action sequences (including a fine, funny automobile chase through Chicago) and the special effects that finally bring the movie to an end that recalls ""Zabriski Point,"" on a more personal level.When a screenplay is so bad, there truly isn't much that actors can do except behave themselves, which is more or less what happens. In addition to Mr. Douglas and Miss Irving, the most prominent members of the cast are John Cassavetes as the Government kidnapper, Andrew Stevens (Stella's boy) as the son, and Charles Durning as the head of the mysterious institute.The most peculiar thing about the movie is why Carrie Snodgress, who retired after receiving an Oscar nomination for ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" should have elected to use it as her comeback film. It's a nothing rolethat of a psychiatric instructor who helps Mr. Douglas locate his son. She's efficient and so invisible it's as if she never left home.",1978-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Winner's Version of 'Big Sleep':Showroom Piece,"HOWARD HAWKS directed the 1946 version of ""The Big Sleep"" in black and white, so it's conceivable that Mr. Hawks didn't furnish Philip Marlowe's bedroom with color-coordinated sheets and blankets merely because he wasn't able to. However, it's also conceivable that Mr. Hawks chose deliberately to depict Marlowe as something other than an immaculately appointed fellow with a decorating flair. Michael Winner's new film version of the Raymond Chandler novel concentrates so heavily on the dapper side of Marlowe that it makes the first version look like an unmade bedwhich may be what it was meant to look like, after all.There are no shadows in this senselessly gaudy remake; there isn't much nighttime, either, and there isn't any rain. There isn't any Los Angeles, because Mr. Winner, pretending to switch the story's setting to London for no intelligible reason, seems actually to have transferred it to a succession of furniture-store showrooms. Not a single prop looks used, not even the dainty china cups put of which Marlowe drinks his morning coffee.The name of Lew Grade, the British entrepreneur who ""presents"" this new versionhe has also sponsored ""The Cassandra Crossing"" and ""Voyage of the Damned""has come to denote too many stars and not enough savvy. Sure enough, ""The Big Sleep"" is overloaded with big names, and in this case the net effect of an all-star cast is to make an already confusing mystery even harder to follow.Oliver Reed is hilariously foppish as the gangster Eddie Mars and Richard Boone is almost as delightful a villain here as he as in ""The Shootist."" But Joan Collins, Edward Fox, John Mills and even James Stewart get lost in the shuffle, reeling off plot details that will seem confusing to anyone who hasn't seen Mr. Hawks's version or read Mr. Chandler's, and numbingly familiar to anyone who has.As the insinuatingly sensual Charlotte Sternwood, in a role first played by Lauren Bacall, Sarah Miles is at least twice as lewd as the screenplay requires her to be, and nowhere near as electrifying. Candy Clark, as Miss Miles's mad younger sister, winds up in desperate trouble Under Mr. Winner's dependably off-base direction, Miss Clark skips and giggles and foams at the mouth, frantically overplaying the most unsalvageable kook role of her kook-ridden career. It would be lovely to find her playing someone who made sense once in a while.Mr. Winner, who wrote the screenplay as well as directed it, approaches Mr. Chandler's material with the same depth and delicacy he brought to ""Death Wish."" It's hard to imagine a director less suited to the subtleties of this kind of story, but then subtleties aren't anything Mr. Winner even tries for. Instead of struggling with the seediness implicit in this story's layer upon of layer of corruption. Mr. Winner substitutes a high-priced vulgarity that wipes out every last touch of evil. The villains in this version aren't wicked, and they aren't even particularly villainous. They just manage to do everything in stultifyingly bad taste.If Robert Mitchum seemed to be an effective Marlowe in the 1975 ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" that had as much to do with Dick Richards's carefully evocative direction as it did with the actor's performance.Mr. Mitchum's world-weariness and his unflappable calm simply don't, on their own, add up to the suspicious, swaggering style that the character and the overall movie require. Taking the strong, silent route once again, Mr. Mitchum gives a performance meant to blend in with the kind of lurid and evocative backdrop Mr. Richards's film provided. But Mr. Winner strips away the neon colors, the 40's costumes and the pulp-novel paraphernalia, substituting sunny skies and a lot of green lawn. With only that to work against, the best Mr. Mitchum can do, figuratively speaking, is to play croquet.",1978-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'House Calls':Divorcee's Love Story,"WANTED: Personable actress, mid-30's or older, to play a wry divorce with romantic leanings, a consumer advocate who gets most of her information from Reader's Digest, and avid reader of nothing but best sellers, and perhaps the first movie heroine to make her living by baking since Mildred Pierce. Divorce will meet and fall for a surgeon, now an eligible widower, to be played by a gruff, lovable actor who never stands up straight. Eventually, they will jog together and romp in the sand. Presumably, this will be love.If all of this makes perfect sense to you, consider the fact that the sweethearts of ""House Calls"" are played by Glenda Jackson and Walter Matthau, an odd couple if ever there was one. Mr. Matthau is no problem: He has been gruff but lovable before, and he never stands up straight anyway.But Mr. Matthau and Miss Jackson don't particularly set off fireworks together, and Miss Jackson is way too steely to play the kind of woman who'd sit up all night watching the candles burn down if Dr. Right didn't arrive for dinner on schedule, or who would hope to bag that special guy by whipping up that special cheese-cake.Howard Zieff, who also directed ""Slither"" and the frequently funny ""Hearts of the West,"" swivels nervously among enough plot points for three and a half different movies. One of them, the love story, could be ""Pete 'n' Tillie""in fact, it already has been. The second thread is about the workings of a poorly administered hospital, run by a sneakily senile doctor (played by Art Carney) with an amusingly selective memory.The third and most interesting element has to do with the indignities to which the young submit the middle-aged (Mr. Matthau, after attending a rock concert with a nurse he's dating, has to sit in a beanbag chair in her apartment), and to which the middle-aged submit the old.The half movie is an affectionate comedy about a married man who begins to regard himself as a ladykiller when he becomes a bachelor again, and perhaps it should have been a whole movie. But Mr. Matthau's career as a swinger is cut short soon after Miss Jackson blazes a trail to his heart by way of his stomach.Mr. Zieff, who directed commercials before he came to movies, is as crisp and economical with brief comic vignettes as he is overwhelmed by the demands of a sustained plot; ""House Calls"" continuously juggles fast, flashy jokes with nagging inconsistencies. The early portion of the movie is quite promising, especially sincebecause the doctor meets the divorce when the rewires her broken jaw, and she doesn't get to talk until later onit takes a while to realize how seriously Miss Jackson has been miscast.Once it becomes apparent that this droll, tough-minded actress is playing a tomato who wants little more from life than a few trash novels and a jogging partner, confusion set in.""House Calls"" tries to seem stern and modern in establishing the divorce's independence, and her superiority to the bimbos the doctor regularly courts, but it turns too sentimental too soon. One minute these lovers are talking good, solid horse sense about their relationship; the next minute they're mired in mush.Mr. Zieff seems never to have determined what sort of romance he wanted to show, and as a result the movie is constantly contradicting itself.Mr. Matthau, Miss Jackson and Mr. Carney are as pleasant and plausible as a jumpy screenplay and Mr. Zieff's wandering directorial attention will allow Richard Benjamin is less unctuous here than he's been in years, and Candice Azzara, in something like a Judy Holliday role, offers the kind of quick caricature that Mr. Zieff often uses to fill his movies with types rather than people.Among the questions the film inadvertently raises are: How does Mr. Matthau manage to charm a rich widow into reconsidering her lawsuit against the hospital merely by mentioning Brooklyn? Has there ever been a clumsier seduction scene than the the main one presented here? And how come Mr. Matthau, after Miss Jackson steals his clothes and hides them in her freezer, manages to find in her closet a boa-trimmed bathrobe that fits him better than it fits her.""House Calls"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because Mr. Matthau spends part of the movie as a swinger and because he and Miss Jackson evidently become more than good friends.",1978-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'American Hot Wax':Brooklyn Rocks,"THERE'S the seed of an interesting movie inside ""American Hot Wax,"" but it never gets a chance to sprout. The picturesque aspects of the 50's reach way beyond cinch belts and finny Cadillacs, and the flap surrounding the birth of rock-and-roll is evidence that style can be as important as substance in initiating social change. But ""American Hot Wax,"" which has a plot so thin you could thread a needle with it, chooses to see the era strictly in terms of the B-movie melodramas it produced.""Look,"" says the disk jockey Alan Freed, as the police try to muscle in on a concert he is sponsoring, ""you can close the show. You can stop me. But you never can stop rock-and-roll, don't you know that?"" Of course they know it, and we know it, tooas the title of one song performed at this same concert puts it, ""Rock-and-Roll Is Here to Stay."" The suspenseful elements of the movie, and its stabs at poignancy, are strictly old news.Alan Freed, played gently and reservedly by Tim McIntire, is less the movie's focus than its storm center. Freed, who pointedly applied the name ""rock-and-roll"" to what had once been called ""race music,"" and who regularly played records other white disk jockeys were afraid to go near, is never clearly established as a renegade, a fan, a fanatic or even a character.Instead, he's merely someone who marches from his crowded office through his bustling lobby and out to his encircled limousine, giving the camera a chance to glimpse the throngs of fans and musical aspirants who dogged his footsteps. The flurry of activity looks exciting for a while, but sooner or later an audience is bound to grow accustomed to the clutter, and unhappily aware that the movie has nowhere to go.Art Linson, who also produced ""Car Wash,"" seems to subscribe to the notion that a completely amorphous movie can be a lively movie if everyone just keeps on jiving along and the viewer is never given a chance to think. So ""Car Wash"" was sloppy, and ""American Hot Wax""which also manages to seem strangely anachronistic in applying disco-movie methods to the 50'sis even sloppier.The plot holes are as big as potholes, particularly when it comes to Mr. Freed's payola problems, and to his ambitions as an entrepreneur (in one scene, we watch him trying to buy a huge, very-California mansion that's supposed to be just outside of New York, but we never find out why he wants it or whether the sale is actually made).Mr. Freed's office is full of eager young singers who audition for him, some of them singing songs that were already hits in 1959, when the movie is setare these the people who went on to have the hit records, or are they merely imitating the most popular numbers of the day? Why are some hits attributed to the people who actually sang them, and others attributed to fictitious singers? Is Laraine Newman, of ""Saturday Night Live,"" really plausible as an enormously gifted young songwriter, the kind of girl who later grew up to become Carole King?The movie's cast includes some of the world's oldest teen-agers, like Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, old favorites who unfortunately perform their material as if they had been performing it for 20 years. (They have been.) It also includes the record producer Richard Perry, featured in a rousing little sequence that shows him making up the arrangement for ""Come and Go With Me"" right there in the studio, just by adding the proper set of dom-dom-dom-dom-dom's.And there is a wonderful, unexpectedly delicate scene between Freed and a young boy (Moosie Drier), who is president of the Buddy Holly fan club and who begins to cry as he tries to explain to Freed's listeners why he loved the late Holly so much. On this boy's face, there is more passion, more hopefulness, more understanding of what rock-and-roll meant to those who were most powerfully influenced by it than there is anywhere else in the movie.Some of the music is expertly repdered, particularly by the four blae male singers who play a fictitious group called The Chesterfields, and some of the concert numbers, like one by three women in spangled turquoise dresses, make a strongly evocative visual impression. A feeling of nostalgia does come through, powerfully at times. But there should have been a lot more to ""American Hot Wax"" than memories.",1978-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Matthau in 'Casey's Shadow':The Big Race,"""CASEY'S SHADOW"" is not exactly an offbeat horse movie, but it is so decently tempered and its principal characters so surprising at important moments that, in the world of horse movies it seems rare indeed. Having said that, I should admit I've never been a particular fan of movies about horses, not since I was very young and a pony I was feeding made a serious if unsuccessful attempt to take a few fingers too. I've nothing against horses, but I let them go their way while I go mine.""Casey's Shadow,"" which opens today at the Loews State 2 and Baronet Theaters, is much more reliable than your average, mean-spirited pony. It's about a splendidly fast 2-year-old quarter horse named Casey's Shadow, about the big race (the All-American Futurity at Ruidoso, N. M.) he is expected to win, and about the little boy named Casey who loves him. It's also about Lloyd Bourdelle (Walter Matthau), Casey's dad, a kindly, tobacco-chewing slob who trains quarter horses on a run-down Louisiana farm, and about Casey's oldest brother Buddy (Andrew A. Rubin), who acts as an assistant trainer and as the conscience of the family, in the absence of a mother who has fled for what appear to have been good reasons. Among other things, they're born losers.With the exception of a tendency to overorchestrate the movie in the manner of television commercials, Martin Ritt, the director, has made such an easygoing, understated film, one of such good feelings, that it seems almost rude to fault it for clichssuch as the big raceit cannot avoid, though it attempts to play them down. In the case of the race, this is done by showing us the race entirely in slow motion, which has the odd, not entirely unpleasant, effect of completely dissipating the tension.More important to the total effect of the film are the performances, especially those of Mr. Matthau, who plays the father with an unusual mixture of intelligence and comic wilfullness; Alexis Smith, as a rich, very classy owner of quarter horses, a person with both scruples and humor, and Mr. Rubin, as the son who must forever pick up after his father.The principal supporting roles are handled by Stephan Burns, as the Bourdelle son who doubles as the family jockey; Michael Hershewe, as Casey, the youngest son who has the tough job of attempting to be both lovable and, on occasion, stupid, and Murray Hamilton and Robert Webber, who are as close to villains as the film contains.The screenplay by Carol Sobieski, based on a John McPhee story, manages to touch almost all of the bases one expects in a horse movie, but it does so without condescension. The screenplay even has the temerity to suggest that the racing of 2-year-old quarter horses, whose leg bones have not yet matured, may be a much more cruel sport than anyone in the film, with the exception of a veterinarian, cares to acknowledge. I'm not sure this is true but it's nice to know that Ray Stark, the producer, has taken the matter under consideration.""Casey's Shadow,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggesed""), contains an explicitly photographed foaling sequence, which might be perfectly harmless facts-of-life material except that the mare dies in the process. It thus may raise more questions in the minds of the very young than it answers.",1978-03-17T05:00:00+0000

The players full names are John Johnson, Dave Heaverlo, tiary Thomasson, Gary Alexander, Alan Wirth and Phil Huffman, but none are household names. Of the six, only Gary Thomas son, a 26yearold outfielder, is an established major leaguer. In his sixth season last year, he hit .246 with 17 homers and 71 runs batted in. Gary Alexander hit .303 last year as the ailrookie catcher. Those two apparently can play and Dave Heav erlo apparently can pitch. He had a 51 wonlost record and a 2.55 earnedrun average last season in 56 games out of the bul pen. The three others are pitching prospects up from the minors. But if all six suddenly were put on the freeagent market, it's unlikely their cumulative value would be $1.75 million, the amount that Charles 0.

us,'Straight Time' a Film of Grim Wit,"""Max,"" says the parole officer, ""I think you have a serious attitude problem."" Just how serious is the dramatic substance of ""Straight Time,"" the grimly witty account of the decline of Max Dembo (Dustin Hoffman), an ex-con (six years for armed robbery) who would say that he pursues success though he measures his life in small failures and the treacheries of others. He knows the world is crooked and he behaves accordingly. Like millions of other people who live on the right side of the law, Max never questions the system. He simply tries to beat it in his own half-baked way.Max is the sort of fellow who automatically lies when someone asks him how much rent he pays. It would make no difference if he told the truth, but Max has to keep in practice. The only time he can look someone in the eye with ease is when he stares, through the slits in a face maskduring a holdup.Max is shrewd, self-absorbed, tough in superficial ways, and doomed. He defines the meaning of recidivism. In real life you wouldn't trust him to hang up your coat. In ""Straight Time,"" in the person of Dustin Hoffman, he's a fascinating character, made romantic only to the extent that an actor of such stature invests him with importance that is otherwise denied. Max is strictly small-time.Even though ""Straight Time,"" which opens today at the Coronet Theater, has been tailored to Max's dimensions it's not a small-time movie. Ulu Grosbard, the director, and Alvin Sargent. Edward Bunker and Jeffrey Boam, who wrote the screenplay, have succeeded in making an uncommonly interesting film about a fellow whose significance is entirely negative. It's almost as if the real subject of the movie were all the things Max isn't.This may be to invest ""Straight Time"" with more purpose than was ever intended, but it is such a leanly constructed, vividly staged film that one seeks to justify the way it compels the attention. The first words we hear in the movie are those of the guards as Max is getting out of prison""Open the gates""while the rest of the film is the detailed case history of a man doing his unconscious best to get back in.The movie makes no attempt to explain Max. It simply says that this is the way he is. It requires us to fill in the gaps, and it's the measure of the film that we want to. In the meantime, we watch as Max has his early run-ins with his Los Angeles parole officer, a sadistic, patronizing redneck, marvelously well-played by M. Emmet Walsh, and accept as inevitable his return to life as a holdup man.The film's most surprising and involving sequences are the series of heists that Max carries out, at first solo, then in the company of an old associate, a fellow named Jerry Schue (Harry Dean Stanton), an ex-con, now a paint contractor apparently happily married, who is going out of his mind with the boredom of a settled life that involves a backyard swimming pool and barbecue pit.""Straight Time"" makes a concession to convention in the casting of Theresa Russell as the young woman who has a brief affair with Max. Miss Russell, who was so good in ""The Last Tycoon,"" is an extremely appealing actress, with a kind of contemporary authority, but she looks so classy, so understated-chic, that she suggests an upper-class girl whose path would cross Max's only at the beach, or maybe at a singles bar. The two really belong in different movies.The film is beautifully acted by everyone, but especially by Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Stanton and Gary Busey, who plays a junkie friend of Max who cops out at the last minute of a crucial job. ""Straight Time"" is not a movie to raise the spirits. It is so cool it would leave a chill were it not done with such precision and control that we remain fascinated by a rat, in spite of ourselves.",1978-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Scruples, the name of Billy's jazzy Beverly Hills boutique, are what Billy got rid of during her Cinderella emergence from being fat and poor and Bostonian to being thin and powerful.

It is not, he writes, from the New Deal that the Republican Party has not recovered but from the nomination in 1990 of one of the most preposterous figures ever to lead a major party. And some of the difficulties the Democrats now face can be traced to the nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson in 1952. Stevenson simply was not fit to be the national leader of a great party. What made Willkie preposterous is not altogether clear, though one part of the indictment seems to be that he was the creature of a movement outside the structure of his party (Mr. Fairlie distinguishes harshly between movements and parties, the former tending to be ideological and undisciplined, the latter being cohesive and capable of governing, as distinct from preaching.)

us,Screen: Moishe Mizrahi's 'Rosa',"Israeli films, even the best, are specialized entertainments for most American audiences. They tend to deal in sentiment of an intensity that strikes us as almost rude. In our popular literature, as defined by the sitcoms of television, we take close family relationships for granted and move on to other matters: Will dad allow the kids to go on that camping trip? Otherwise, we treat family relationships as subjects for psychoanalytical scrutiny because we know that nothingcertainly not lovecan be trusted to be exactly what it seems. Just beyond one's love of mom is the raging desire to carry her off to the nearest honeymoon motel.In Israeli films, family relationships are fundamental and secure, even if the film happens to be about changing attitudes toward them. One result is that Israeli films often seem too simple and sunny for sophisticated American audiences. What we fail to detect in the intensity of these feelings is an element that is far from sentimental, but is, rather, dark, obsessivethe need to establish continuity in the face of chaos.These thoughts are prompted by ""Madame Rosa,"" which is not an Israeli film at all. It is, in fact, France's nominee for the Oscar as the best foreign-language film of 1977, but it was directed (beautifully) by Moishe Mizrahi, the Egyptian-born Israeli director best known in this country for his Israeli films, ""I Love You, Rosa"" and ""The House on Chelouche Street.""Though it's not an Israeli movie, ""Madame Rosa"" makes profoundly moving the kind of emotions that have earlier been involved rather than effectively demonstrated by Mr. Mizrahi in even ""The House on Chelouche Street."" ""Madame Rosa,"" which opens today at the Plaza Theater, is sweet and tough in conventional ways, but it also acknowledges something you don't often see except in the films of directors like Renoir and Truffaut, that the greatest courage may often be the will to go on, to continue, in the conviction that there is nothing but darkness beyond.Such a character is Madame Rosa, born and raised a French Jew, self-described agnostic, a once-gaudy whore who was the toast of a few streets of Paris, but who has been inactive since her release from Auschwitz at the end of World War II. To make ends meet, Madame Rosa now runs a kind of makeshift boarding house in her cramped, sixth-floor flat in Paris's Belleville quarter, a working-class district where Algerians, black Africans, Jews and gentiles live in a harmony dictated by necessity. Her boarders are the off-spring of her friends and former associates in ""the life,"" some of whom take their parental duties as seriously as busy film stars who make it a point to see their children once a week, while others leave them and vanish.As played by Simone Signoret, Madame Rosa is a tremendous character, an overwhelming mountain of worn-out flesh whose arteries are hardening, whose ankles are weak, and whose lungs are less dependable than a couple of ancient innertubes. Madame Rosa is tired. She's in the process of dying and she's afraid, not because of what comes after deathshe's tough enough to face that, except sometimes in the middle of the nightbut because of what will happen to her last boarder, a solemn, old-for-his-years, Arab boy named Momo (Samy Ben Youb).Momo is one of her abandoned boarders. As, little by little, the other children are picked up by their mothers and placed in other refuges, Momo stays on because he has no place else to go. He's both attached to Madame Rosa and furious. One day he steals a dog from a pet shop, cares for it lovingly and then, in an act he can't explain, sells the dog to a passerby and drops the 500 francs thus earned into the sewer. Madame Rosa thinks he may be losing his mind. Actually he's passing through puberty.""Madame Rosa,"" which Mr. Mizrahi has adapted from the 1975 Prix Goncourt novel by Emile Ajar, is a story of love and especially of mutual need and appreciation that will, I suppose, be read as some kind of parable about the Near East, though that is to freight it with a kind of political significance it doesn't have to depend on. It's a clear-eyed, often very funny film about two brave, complex, immensely appealing characters as they discover resources within themselves that are as surprising to them as to us.Miss Signoret has her best role in years, one that uses the extraordinary physical presence she has become without exploiting it. As Momo, Samy Ben Youb  slight, large-eyed, solemn  matches her performance perfectly. Claude Dauphin has several very effective moments as Madame Rosa's old doctor, a fellow who is understandably somewhat shocked when Momo, with the best of intentions and the most careful tact, tries to talk the doctor in putting the old lady out of her misery. Costa Gavras, the director of ""Z"" and other films, makes a sort of token appearance as the father of the family Momo will probably move in with.There are sentimental moments in ""Madame Rosa,"" but they are the shadows, not the substance, of a very good, very firm movie.",1978-03-19T05:00:00+0000

There are reasons, of course, for such things. Many women have had a hard time adjusting to the voluminous freeflowing look. Designer Bill Blass says, American women have worked hard to keep their good figures and want to show them. Perry Ellis who made his reputation designing oversized clothes for young women  now asks, How much bigger can clothes get? And Calvin Klein has always contended that American women like the comfort of loose clothes but don't want them too big. What's interesting  and good  about these new clothes is that they are not copies of the 1950's pinchedin plastered-to-the-body look. They do show a woman's curves, but are cut to move with her body, not constrict it. One note of caution: These curvingcloser clothes are one more manifestation of the present fashion for a beautiful body.

The method of the film is so self-effacing as to be no method at all, a series of close-ups and medium close-ups of this extraordinary, shrewd, amazingly vigorous old woman as she answers questions put to her by the film maker.""The Confessions of Winifred Wagner"" is ironically titled in that Winifred Wagner tells everything but confesses nothing. With the kind of candor that is so aggressive that it puts her listeners on the defensive, she talks about her early meetings with Hitler, and of their shared love of the music of Richard Wagner that became the basis of a friendship that lasted from 1922 until Hitler's death in 1945.She also talks about family squabbles, about her early decision to put her husband and his work with the Bayreuth Festival ahead of her children""There were always people to take care of them""about great musicians she's known, about the rise of National Socialism and the devastating war; but always what fascinates us is the manner in which she resolutely refuses to turn her back on Hitler.Winifred Wagner professes to believe that she was always ""unpolitical,"" that the Hitler she knew was a kind and gentle man, and, when she is pressed, that he really wasn't responsible for the Final Solution. Both she and Hitler, she says rather airily, were sad about the bombing of London, but by that time she considered herself to be completely German. There were no feelings of divided loyalties.""The Confessions of Winifred Wagner"" is much more than the self-serving memoir it might initially appear to be, largely because Winifred Wagner is too honest in her own way to be concerned with the minor disturbances of reputation. What we see on the screen is one manifestation of a singular family, as well as of an entire European cultural tradition, captured simply, cleanly, by a film maker who understands that by deferring to its subject, the camera is most often victorious.""The Confessions of Winifred Wagner,"" will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 P.M., and repeated there next week, Thursday through Sunday, at the same time.",1978-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: What Happened After 'The Other Side':In Love With a Trucker,"AT THE END of ""The Other Side of the Mountain,"" the 1975 movie based on the life of Jill Kinmont, Jill (Marilyn Hassett), the radiantly pretty championship skier who'd been paralyzed in a downhill accident, was coping quite beautifully with her paraplegia, with the loss of her fianc in a plane accident and with the loss of her fatherheart attack, I think. She was finding a new life as a teacher.At the start of ""The Other Side of the Mountain, Part II,"" which opens at the Guild and other theaters today, Jill Kinmont, still played by Miss Hassett, continues not simply to cope, but to achieve. Very early on she's named Los Angeles's Woman of the Year and almost immediately meets and falls in love with handsome, sensitive John Boothe (Timothy Bottoms), a long-distance trucker who comes from her hometown of Bishop, Calif.The fact that a lot of us already know that in real life Miss Kinmont and Mr. Boothe got married creates certain difficulties for Douglas Day Stewart, who wrote the screenplay for this sequel to the extremely popular first film. The problem with ""Part II"" is that there is no problem.The ones that Mr. Stewart has attempted to dramatize are lugubriously unbelievable. Jill supposedly thinks of herself as a bad-luck charm""everyone I've ever loved has died""and so she puts off John. Then she tries to convince us that though they love each other, they are incompatible. ""He's not interested in anything I am,"" she says, ""not books or plays or concerts,"" though the Jill we see is hardly a culture-nut.The first film, directed by Larry Peerce, who also directed the spinoff, was a slickly prefabricated bathtub of movie sentimentality, at the heart of which was a gallant young woman facing real handicaps. ""Part II' is really a 30-minute postscript to that story, blown up to feature-length by artificial plot problems and so many flashbacks to the first movie that the second becomes a sort of reverse trailer, a coming attraction for something that's already gone.All of the characters are so relentlessly genial that the movie comes to look like the smile on a billboard. I suppose that some interest is generated by our curiosity about the sexual lives of paraplegics, but this subject is so discreetly attended to that it seems to be another one of the film's nonproblems.Mr. Peerce's direction suggests a certain amount of desperation. You can almost hear him asking, ""What can I do to make things interesting?"" Sometimes characters talk to each other's backs, but mostly they just look cheery. In moments of emotional crescendo, he puts his camera on a helicopter so that it can slowly pull away from the scene in a grand manner that may or may not indicate God is taking care of things.""The Other Side of the Mountain, Part II,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), indicates that before their marriage Miss Kinmont and Mr. Boothe went off on a trial honeymoon, during which they sometimes shared the some bed.",1978-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Mania's World:Swedish Drama,"PSYCHIATRISTS are the villains of ""Near and Far Away"" and, as depicted by the Swedish director and co-scenarist Marianne Ahrne, they're sitting ducks. As Mania, an earnest student who works in a mental hospital, becomes more and more attached to a handsome, mute young man on her ward, her superiors notice only that there's a case of countertransference under way. Mania is gentle and loving, full of understanding and wonder, and her teachers are, by comparison, a bunch of cold, careerist dunderheads who think they can help anguished patients by prescribing sleeping pills. Small wonder, then, that the handsome young man would rather make eyes at Mania than talk to anyone else.The film, which opens today at the Cinema Studio, is ambiguous about the reasons for the young man's silence, but he seems to have made a conscious decision to stop speaking, rather than having fallen victim to some mysterious ailment. His lover, whom Mania goes to visitand of whom she is very commendably not jealoussuggests that the young man has chosen to explore the world within rather than the world without, and that sometimes actual words only get in the way of true knowledge.Mania, who has never had the good sense to change her name to anything less redolent, never emerges as more than a cardboard figure, and Lilga Kovanko plays her with a great deal of warmth but not much variety. Robert Farrant, as the mute, is sometimes afforded the camera's intensive scrutiny, sometimes used only as Mania's foil; he is often compelling, but always a little more elusive than the screenplay demands.The other actors function more as props than as characters. The story's two doctors, played by Helge Skoog and Jan Erik Lindqvist, exist only to espouse rigid attitudes and behave with improbable insensitivity, and Annicka Kronberg, playing Mania's temporary roommate, is merely someone for the heroine to talk to. Owe Stefanson, as an inmate whose specialty is demanding cigarettes from strangers who have already given him cigarettes, seems at least as interesting and troubled as the mute, but Mania is considerably less interested in befriending this much less attractive fellow.Miss Ahrne's film is carefully made and elegantly photographed, but it flows much too smoothly from one prettily austere setting to another, with no texture to catch the eye and no loose ends to hold the interest. Events proceed according to a schedule that is apparent 15 minutes into the film, and there are no real surprises in store.",1978-03-24T05:00:00+0000

The native American peoples practiced customs and modes of life of remarkable diversity, held a great variety of beliefs and world views and spoke many languages unintelligible to one another. When Columbus made his landfall in 1992, in fact, these people had no conception of themselves  no name for themselves  as a single entity. For all practical purposes, at least, the.collectivity we call American Indians was nonexistent. Columbus, who thought he was somewhere off the Asian coast, casually referred to the natives he saw as Los Indios (India then was the name for all of Asia east of the river Indus), and the name stuck as a collective designation for all native Americans. This fateful misno. mer exemplifies the bald fact that the idea of the Indian was a white invention, and an ideological weapon of deadly effectiveness. By enabling the conquering whites to lump together under one racist stereotype all of the cultures between what is now Canada and Chile, the concept of an American Indian has been an invaluable aid in the subjugation of the people it names.",1978-03-26T05:00:00+0000

The year's first major corporate struggle pits the $309million-a-year nuclear and aerospace company based in New Jersey against the $977-million-a-year Kennecott company in a proxy battle to elect Kennecott's 17member board. CurtissWright, with a 9.9 percent stake in the copper company, feels that the $567 million Kennecott spent to acquire the Carborundum Company should rightlyhave been used to directly benefit Kennecott shareholders, and has indicated that if successful, it would sell Carborundum and make the proceeds available to Kennecott stockholders. Kennecott, in defense, has filed suit in New York to block Curtiss Wright's solicitation of proxies, while in Utah, where Kennecott is a major employer, state securities officials won an order temporarily barring CurtissWright from voting its Kennecott interest at the May 2 annual meeting in New York, soliciting proxies or buying any more Kennecott stock.. .. The dispute between the Navy and the General Dynamics Corporation over the price of nuclear submarines, on the other hand, appeared headed for a settlement. Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, announced that General Dynamics had decided to continue work on the subs, a job that employs almost 14,000 workers, after the Navy agreed to make an immediate provisional cash payment to ameliorate the drag on General Dynamics's fis nances caused by cost overruns.",1978-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Word Is Out' Documentary:Twenty-six Homosexuals Are Interviewed on Lives,"Most of the 26 homosexual men and women interviewed in ""Word Is Out"" are photographed at home, and a couple of their homes look alike. A curvaceous blond woman, with teased hair and bright blue eyeshadow and little earrings, sits flanked by photographs of her children in a suburban living room; another woman, who seems to be a man until she identifies herself as a mother, appears in a similar setting. As it later turns out, these two people are ensconced on the very same sofa, and they have been lovers for nine years, ever since they were introduced by their neighborhood Avon lady.One of the most appealing things about this graceful, funny and often very moving documentary, now at the Eastside Cinema, is its altogether disarming presentation of material that might have invited prejudice or misunderstanding; in this case, what could have been a titillating revelation is artfully molded into nothing more than a wry and tender little surprise. ""Word Is Out,"" made by the Mariposa Film Group, is comfortably constructed and quite informative, but what really carries the film is its casual seductiveness. Even filmgoers who imagine they'd rather sit through root canal work than find out what it's like to be homosexual may wind up unexpectedly captivated by the film's friendly, even-handed approach to a potentially divisive subject.""Word Is Out"" is at times extremely romantic, full of people gently reminiscing about what it was like to fall in love for the first time. And, as befits its romantic spirit (and its obvious desire to appeal to filmgoers of all sexual persuasions), the movie leaves sex to the imagination. One woman, who stridently announces herself to be a black lesbian (and who sits before a stained-glass window bearing a combined feminist and black power logo), simply talks about the way she gradually found herself looking forward to lunch dates with a particular woman friend much more enthusiastically than she awaited her dates with men in the evening.A man wistfully describes an adolescent crush that blossomed into a 10-year love affair. And another man, a student, remembers being so thrilled by someone who brushed against his knee as they watched Part Three of Kenneth Clark's ""Civilisation"" series that he eagerly dashed back to catch Parts Four and Five.The film's most stirring sequence involves a young man who dated the same girl for years but never felt adequate to the situation. Then he had a quick homosexual experience; still, the earth failed to move. Finally, he met a man he could really care about. ""When I was in high school, I thought I was one of those cold people who could never love anybody,"" he says quietly. ""And when I fell in love with this guy, it meant so much to me. It meant I was a real person . . . I was using a part of myself that I never felt before . . . and the best part, too."" At a preview screening of ""Word Is Out,"" there wasn't a dry eye in the house after that particular revelation.Much of the film is laced with humor: a hefty comedienne recalls joining the WAC's, marching into the mess hall and hearing cries of ""Good god, Elizabeth, here comes another one!"" One fellow in makeup and a nose ring complains that ""toy stores are sexist, so you have to buy the Ken doll and then go over to Barbie's department to get a tutu.""Most of the interviewees are quite appealing, but a few of them aren't, and that's one of the film's most refreshing aspects. One man, an actor who endlessly congratulates himself for being ""weird,"" would be a bit grating under any circumstances. The film simply presents him as part of a very broad spectrum, and the lack of any insistence upon gay supremacy or solidarity leaves the viewer quite free to draw his or her own conclusions.The people presented here range from their 20's to their 70's, from being almost overbearingly articulate to communicating mostly through facial gestures, from being extroverted and affectionate to feeling isolated and private. The one thing they seem to have in commonsomething that makes the film particularly attractiveis a kind of confidence and certainty, the ability to speak matter-of-factly and behave with firm conviction.",1978-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,'Sylphide' Opens Beacon's Ballet Film Series,"The Beacon Theater opens what it calls the First Ballet Film Festival today with an unusual, potentially controversial, film version of the 19th-century Romantic ballet ""La Sylphide.""The three-week series will alternate five different programs. If some of the ballets on camera have been seen in New York before, most of the actual films have not. The ""Sylphide,"" for instance, is a Paris Opra Ballet production that attempts to go back to the original 1832 French version, although the production consistently presented in the United States has been the 1836 version from Denmark by August Bournonville.Tomorrow, the Beacon will present two films made by a West German television producer shortly after the New York City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival, one of which is George Balanchine's ""Pulcinella"" from that festival. The other is the City Ballet in Mr. Balanchine's ""Liebeslieder Walzer."" Thursday brings in Alicia Alonso's ""Giselle"" with the National Ballet of Cuba. The 1964 film, starring Miss Alonso, was seen at a gala for the New York Public Library's Dance Collection but has not had general release in New York.The other two films are a 1967 view of the Bolshoi Ballet and the previously distributed and very successful filmed version of Rudolf Nureyev's production of ""Don Quixote"" for the Australian Ballet.Meanwhile, we have ""La Sylphide,"" starring Ghislaine Thesmar and Michael Denard, both of whom will appear live on stage at the theater tonight in a precurtain pas de deux. Miss Thesmar's husband, the choreographer Pierre Lacotte, first tried to reconstruct the original ""Sylphide"" in a production for French television in 1971. Presumably this is the same film. In 1972, the Paris Opra Ballet transferred the production to its stage.If we are to believe the rather inaccurate handout provided by the Beacon, Mr. Lacotte discovered a long-lost notation of some of the original choreography by Philippe Taglioni and much of the original score by Jean Schneitzhoeffer in an attic belonging to a godchild of the son of Marie Taglioni, who created the title role March 12, 1832 in Paris. Because modern audiences have been familiar only with totally new choreographic versions or the 1836 Bournonville recension with a score by the Danish composer Hermann Lowenskjold, Mr. Lacotte's attempted reconstruction is, of course, of great interest.Alas. It is so stylistically and dramatically out of kilter with what we know about Romantic ballet in general and ""La Sylphide"" in particular that it is difficult to have confidence in the authenticity of the choreography itself.The story and the structure are identical to the Bournonville versionthe Taglioni version survived into Petipa's day in Russia. In this film version, James, a Scottish farmer, is still torn between his fiance, Effie (Laurance Nerval), and the sylphide; a woodland spirit.Yet here, so wrongly, the sylph is made to appear no different from the mortals around her. The crucial distinction, that she wears toe shoes while Effie and her friends do not, is not maintained. All are on pointe.Repeatedly, James gathers her in his arms and partners her while the dramatic point is that she must die at the human's touch. In Act I, a strangely modern pas de trois, in full Antony Tudor psychological style, shows James interchangeably partnering the two women in his life.Stylistically, of course, 19th-century Romantic ballerinas could not turn so quickly on their toes or keep their legs up so high. Nor did the man have such bravura dancing. What Mr. Lacotte has done is not try to replicate authentic style, but possibly to give us some of Taglioni's choreography. His Sylphide certainly darts around much more than her Bournonville counterpart, and she works harder, too. This film is worth seeing for every balletomane precisely because it is so wrong-headed.",1978-03-28T05:00:00+0000

""I'd have preferred a girl cousin,"" Claude tells us matter-of-factly on the soundtrack, ""but I didn't have any choice.""There is nothing wrong with Claude that time and heterosexual experience won't see him safely through, which is the subject of ""The First Time,"" Claude Berri's latest comic memoir about growing up healthy, bright, sensitive and generally happy, to become eventually Claude Berri, the successful, funny and infinitely generous French film maker.""The First Time"" picks up the story of the same Claude, also played by Mr. Cohen, in Mr. Berri's first film, ""The Two of Us"" (1968), about the film maker's experiences during the German occupation, when he was a little boy and was sent from Paris to live in the country with a crusty, wheezing old anti-Semite, played by Michael Simon.Mr. Berri's use of autobiographical material, as well as his continuing relationship with Mr. Cohen as his surrogate screen self, inevitably recalls Franois Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films in which Jean-Pierre Laud, as Antoine, has gown before our eyes from adolescence to manhood. There is a major difference between the work of the two directors, though. Mr. Truffaut's comedies are illuminated by a kind of madness, an awareness of ultimate despair. They are the work of the permanent outsider, someone who will never feel quite at home in the bourgeois society he thinks he admires.Mr. Berri's films, including ""Marry Me, Marry Me,"" which is the story of Claude as a young man, are obviously the work of someone who feels completely at home, a fellow whose family ties are emotionally secure in ways that will forever elude the poor, obsessed Antoine.""The First Time,"" which opens today at the Columbia 2 Theater, is all about sex  about Claude's disastrous first encounter with a woman for pay, then about his more successful encounters with girls his own age  yet the mood is so gentle, so understanding, so optimistic, the film has the air of pure fantasy. This may be exactly what the director and writer intended, yet I prefer Mr. Berri in a somewhat less benign frame of mind, as he was in ""Male of the Century,"" in which Claude had grown into an impossibly arrogant  and hilarious  male chauvinist.Though Mr. Cohen is comically serious and charming as the young Claude, Charles Denner, who plays his furrier-father, gives the film its real substance. The straight, no-nonsense relationship between the father and the son is the nicest thing about the movie. Also it's often funnier, in that it is more surprising, than the catalogue of Claude's encounters with women.These are clever and, considering the unsuccessful nature of some, amazingly serene. It's as if, in looking back, Mr. Berri cannot bring himself to fake melodramatic crises when heand weknow that, after all, everything turned out all right.",1978-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Nonetheless, during the NixonFord years, integration proceeded at a snail's pace. Last spring, an exasperated Federal District Court judge ordered H.E.W. to accelerate the pace and it responded with the most vigorous enforcement campaign ever. Last week, H.E.W. initiated formal action to deprive North Carolina of $10 million a year because it failed to submit an acceptable desegregation plan.

""After all,"" says one typical young woman, ""he was only a movie star,"" But for Jimmy J. (Richard Thomas), the death means the loss of someone whose only released film, ""East of Eden,"" defined his own amorphous personality and still unfulfilled life. For a few hours Jimmy J. goes to pieces in the manner he imagines James Dean might have, given the same more or less tacky circumstances.Like Mr. Bridges's ""The Paper Chase,"" the new film is full of affection and carefully observed detail of place and period. But also like the earlier film it lacks the edge of satire that can make the difference between a good film and a great one, between a film that is somehow in thrall to its sentiments instead of being in charge of them.Mr. Bridges likes Jimmy J. so much that he sees more in him than many of the rest of us probably can. Is it because he knows that at the end of the film, after Jimmy J. goes roaring off to California on his James Dean-like motorcycle, Jimmy J. will grow up to be a writer and director of movies, like Mr. Bridges? If so, he knows more than I do.My conviction from the film is that Jimmy J. will land in Hollywood; work at odd jobs and, eventually, settle down as the manager of a supermarket. It is thus apparent that I find the film's implications sadder and more depressing than Mr. Bridges, who, I assume, is drawing on his own life and knows what's going to happen next.""September 30, 1955"" was filmed in Arkansas and even has the look of a movie of the 50's, when film makers were starting to go on location in the interests of accuracy. It is beautifully cast and acted with self-absorbed intensity by a number of young performers who are very, very funny, especially by Deborah Benson, as the college's pretty, square, homecoming queen, a girl who loves Jimmy J. a lot, but who loves conventional behavior even more, and by Lisa Blount, as Jimmy J.'s ex-girlfriend, someone who shares his nutty adoration of James Dean and who must pay a high price to grow up.The problem with ""September 30, 1955"" is that Jimmy J. never does grow up. Essentially he is a figure of comedy, a fellow desperate for direction and out of touch with reality.Mr. Bridges and Mr. Thomas, who was John-Boy on TV's ""The Waltons"" for so many years, insist on treating him as a figure of magic and mystery, as if he were a poet in his own right. To model one's life on that of a movie star to the extent that Jimmy J. does suggests arrested development  though it does say something important (and scary) about the influence of what are sometimes called the popular arts.It is the latter that makes ""September 30, 1955"" so interesting, as well as the ways in which Mr. Bridges recallscomicallyJimmy J.'s attempts to relate the humdrum events of his life with those of the melodramatic movie fiction he so admires. Jimmy J. himself is a cipher to me but the movie around him is extremely stylish, even to the manner in which it takes on in modified formthe shape of juvenile-delinquent films of the 50's. Mr. Bridges is a sophisticated, knowing film maker, but I wish he had built his movie around a tougher, more knowing character we might have believed in.""September 30, 1955,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly obscene language.",1978-03-31T05:00:00+0000

It might be Leslie Nielsen; it might be Bradford Dillman; it might be Richard Egan. For all the difference the fine points of the plot make in ""The Amsterdam Kill,"" it might even be your old Aunt Betty. All that matters is the body count, which is impressive enough to have given a film without sex scenes an R rating. There are so many shootings, and so many hapless victims, that one thug even barges into a kitchen by mistake, machine-gunning a helpless chicken.""The Amsterdam Kill,"" which opens today at a number of neighborhood theaters, has all the weariness of a genre movie but none of the comfortable familiarity. In a misguided attempt to appeal to an international audience, the film flits from London to Hong Kong to Amsterdam; one key scene takes place, for no clear reason, at a horse show in Utrecht. One important Chinese character wears tweeds, plaids and a watchchain on his waistcoat. There are so many shots of airports and train terminals that it begins to seem as if one has purchased a Eu-rail pass rather than a movie ticket. The film is so intent on taking place everywhere that its nervous geography becomes terribly jarring.Robert Mitchum plays a good cop who's been disgraced, but who is still good, the only honest man in a cesspool of international corruption, a disillusioned fellow who can still rise to a challenge if the stakes are high enough . . . oh, you know the type. Mr. Mitchum knows the type, too, so intimately that he manages to lend unexpected weight and dignity to moments of no consequence at all. This is the flimsiest movie Mr. Mitchum has made in some time, but for that very reason his performance is particularly arresting.Most of his dialogue sounds like dialogue, and Mr. Mitchum delivers both the punchy lines (""Let's go stick our finger in somebody's eye"".) and the implausible ones with the cool, dependable air of a man who's only following orders. But there's something impressive about the imperturbability with which he marches through the most potentially embarrassing situations.Robert Clouse also directed ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Black Belt Jones,"" which makes him sound as if he ought to know a thing or two about action footage. Here, however, Mr. Clouse proves himself capable of showing a car being driven through a houseboat and into a canal without generating any excitement at all. The same thing holds true for the film's final demolition scene, which involves a bulldozer, a greenhouse and a very large number of innocent mums and roses.The film's only real selling point is the abundance of fresh flowers that begin to figure into the drug-smuggling plot during the last half-hour. Mr. Clouse can't make a chase through a flower market look any more thrilling than a stroll in a garden might be, but the flowers are nicely photographed and prettily arranged. And, after all, it's springtime.",1978-03-31T05:00:00+0000
