Arna Bontemps, celebrated poet and friend to Hughes, described Not Without Laughter as the novel that both Hughes and his readers knew he had to write, coming as it did on the heels of Hughess two well-received poetry collections, The Weary Blues (1926) and Fine Clothes to the Jew (1927). Hughes published these collections while a student at Lincoln University, and he released Not Without Laughter in 1930, shortly after graduating. By the date of his first book of prose Hughes had become for many a symbol of the black renaissance, Bontemps writes. The stakes were high, then, for the young man born in Joplin, Mo.

So it comes as a surprise to learn that Grafton didnt have a best seller until the series was eight years old and six books along, when F Is for Fugitive finally cracked the paperback list in 1990. When I started writing the series, who even knew this was going to work? Grafton told the critic and editor Sarah Weinman in a 2009 interview for The Los Angeles Times. That was the year that U Is for Undertow came out, and Weinman asked whether Grafton felt any pressure to make it all the way to Z.

Hes been a member so long he can recall when the academy included now all-but-forgotten figures like Malcolm Cowley and Glenway Wescott  white-haired luminaries from another era. Just recently Roth joined William Faulkner, Henry James and Jack London as one of very few Americans to be included in the French Pleiades editions (the model for our own Library of America), and the Italian publisher Mondadori is also bringing out his work in its Meridiani series of classic authors. All this late-life eminence  which also includes the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award in 2012 and being named a commander in the Lgion dHonneur of France in 2013  seems both to gratify and to amuse him.

The main restaurant is the 110-seat Mezzanine, open only for dinner as of now. Another restaurant, Lobby, with an elegant coffered ceiling, is a more informal, all-day cafe. For drinking, theres Coffee Bar, done Venetian-style with antique mirrors, which becomes a cocktail bar in the evening; the Giannini Bar, named for Amadeo Giannini, the banks founder; the Library, where drinks and light food are served; and a Rooftop Bar, with food, for a pool that opens in the spring. The hotel design is elaborate, by Jacques Garcia, the designer of the NoMad in New York, where Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara also run the restaurant and bars. Mr. Guidara said they did not want the menus to replicate those in New York, so for Los Angeles the food is somewhat lighter  like a blue prawn club sandwich with avocado, and various preparations of broccoli, served with black rice and egg. But the signature chicken for two and the Milk & Honey dessert both made it across the country. The executive chef is Chris Flint, who worked at NoMad and Eleven Madison Park in New York. Mark Welker is the executive pastry chef, and the cocktails are the work of Leo Robitschek, who is also the bar director at NoMad in New York. Both the NoMad hotel and NoMad LA are owned by the Sydell Group: 649 South Olive Street (Seventh Street), Downtown Los Angeles, 213-358-0000, thenomadhotel.com/los-angeles.",2018-01-23T18:05:49+0000

Of course Im surprised, especially when its people you know and youve worked with, and then this kind of thing comes to light. But on the other hand, the patriarchy has dominated for thousands of years, and people see it as their God-given right. Its not just sexual harassment or abuse or all the other sexual issues  its everything. According to the I.M.F., when women are equally represented in all aspects of economy and business, it can cause national G.D.P.s to rise rapidly. In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise Americas G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points.

They were filming the latest season of the reality competition show RuPauls Drag Race, and the days challenge was meant to showcase the competitors acting abilities. The challenge, called The Bitchelorette, was a parody of the farcical dynamics that play out on The Bachelor each season.
