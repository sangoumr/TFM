Devoted readers of The Catcher in the Rye can see the illustration of Mr. Salinger that was installed on Monday at the Smithsonians National Portrait Gallery in Washington. The portrait of Mr. Salinger, who died on Wednesday at 91, was created by Robert Vickrey for the cover of Time magazine published on Sept. 15, 1961, and is meant to depict the author against a (metaphorical) amber wave of grain. (In that cover story, which was timed to the publication of Mr. Salingers story collection Franny & Zooey, the Time reporter writes that when Mr. Salinger moved to Cornish, N.H., in the early 1950s, he was friendly and talkative; now when he jeeps to town, he speaks only the few words necessary to buy food or newspapers.) A press representative for the National Portrait Gallery said the painting was given to the gallery by Time magazine in 1978 and was last on display there through 1979. Before Mr. Salingers death, the gallery was planning to install the portrait in its permanent collection exhibition in May.",2010-02-01T16:43:16+0000

Perhaps to illustrate that point, his lawyer has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the bands management, saying its efforts to seek a replacement singer could destroy the group, Billboard reported. In a letter to the bands manager, Howard Kaufman, Mr. Tylers lawyer, Skip Miller, wrote that the attempt was playing band members off against one another and engaging in acts and conduct to the harm and detriment of the singer and the band. Aerosmith without Steven Tyler is like the Rolling Stones without Mick Jagger, or U2 without Bono, Mr. Miller wrote. While this management strategy may get the band on the road a few months sooner, it ultimately could destroy Aerosmith. Aerosmith played its last show on Nov. 1 in Abu Dhabi, where Mr. Tyler, 61, fell from a stage. The bands guitarist Joe Perry said in November that Mr. Tyler had quit the band, only to reunite with him at a concert in New York a few days later.

A pioneer of the shopping-as-entertainment school of retailing, Selfridge was all in favor of using culture to get shoppers through his doors. So while the latest exhibit to go up in the stores gallery space, the Museum of Small Things (MOST), may sound like, well, small potatoes, he would no doubt have approved. Conceived of in collaboration with the artist and designer Kit Grover and POCKO, MOST celebrates the tiny and the trifling. We left the definition of small up to the artists, Grover says. So it can mean something minuscule or something thats generally ignored or thought of as insignificant. The exhibit is arranged in the form of a labyrinth, with a rotating eight-foot head created by the Japanese artist Kin Pro at the center. Kind of like a Macys float, but not from this planet, Grover says. We wanted to play with scale. You cant see all of it as you approach it, so you feel like youre being peered in on by someone very large  and youre miniature. Also included in MOST are a bag by Grayson Perry (limited-edition replicas are available at the exhibit pop-up shop), a Richard Wentworth dictionary (of small, of course) and several films, including I Met the Walrus, which features a soundtrack of an interview a teenage fan did with John Lennon in the 1960s paired with animation by James Braithwaite.

Neil Pepe, the artistic director of the Atlantic Theater Company, is to direct; Mr. Mamet is a founder of the company. The play, about the evolving relationship between a young actor and his older mentor, was first performed in 1977 at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in a production that starred Mike Nussbaum and Joe Mantegna and was directed by Gregory Mosher. That same year it played off Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theater, where it starred Peter Evans and Ellis Rabb and was directed by Gerald Gutierrez.

Perhaps the only more distasteful task in the industry is slaving away at a 627-page biography of a celebrity who has mastered these kinds of games, and Peter Biskind must at least be commended for pushing through to completion on Star, his unlovely but ultimately satisfying book about Warren Beatty. Biskind was never under any illusions about his status vis--vis Beatty in Hollywoods peerage  he writes about the thrill he felt when Beatty first acknowledged his existence on the set of Dick Tracy by balling up a piece of gum and shooting it in his direction  but he surmised, since the notion of collaborating on a book partly belonged to the actor, that on this project he had been greenlighted.

Paris, Texas (1984) isnt just an epic drama that won the Palm dOr at Cannes; nowadays it feels curiously in step with the current cultures ongoing American heritage trip. Shot largely in the Southwest, the film is a paean to America the Authentic: ghost towns, cuffed jeans, the highway, the mustache, the desert landscape, Marlboros, leather boots, chamois shirts, motels, Super-8 home movies, railroad tracks. How convenient then that the Criterion Collection has just remastered the film under the supervision of its director, Wim Wenders, and packaged it stylishly for DVD and Blu-ray. The film, written by Sam Shepard, comes across like a sumptuous coffee-table book inhabited by Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, haunted by the melancholy vibrato of Ry Cooders slide guitar. As the writer Nick Roddick laments in the accompanying essay, The world to which Wenders pays homage is vanishing fast  cellphones have replaced photogenic phone booths, McDonalds franchises have gobbled up roadside diners.

He became obsessed with rumors of a sophisticated lost civilization in the Amazon, which he called the City of Z; he disappeared while searching for it in 1925. Grann pairs this tale with the story of his own sometimes comical pursuit of Fawcett.

Since Adam is completely innocent, this impulse seems, at first blush, rash and stupid, just the sort of irrational, spontaneous bad choice people in thrillers so often make, to seal their author-destined doom. But Ordinary Thunderstorms isnt a thriller, exactly, and Boyd isnt the kind of author who punishes his characters too severely for their spasms of unreason.

The answer came in the form of Underworld, an epic rejoinder that left the reader doubly pummeled: both by the scale of the undertaking and by the sustained intensity with which it was achieved. After such titanic exertions, DeLillos next novel, The Body Artist, felt like a warm-down, but it was followed, disastrously, by the high-concept self-karaoke of Cosmopolis. Even Falling Man, although a partial return to form, failed to satisfy completely: the 9/11 subject matter demanded more.

Bakelite in Yonkers: Pioneering the Age of Plastics, an exhibition that opens on Saturday at the Hudson River Museum, showcases 300 objects from the 1910s to the early 21st century that exploit the unique properties of Phenol-formaldehyde: brilliant color, heat resistance and strength. Bakelite is still used today in car parts, plywood and pan handles (Revere Ware, for example), but the earliest pieces in the exhibition show its decorative side.The early Bakelite objects have a very 19th-century form, said Bartholomew F. Bland, curator of exhibitions at the museum. The designers were consciously trying to mimic marble, ebony and burled wood. By the 1920s and 1930s, the age of streamlining made moldable plastics appealing in their own right. Star designers like Raymond Loewy exploited the range of possible colors and shapes, and the exhibition includes a camera he designed in 1937, along with toys, bangles, radios, typewriters, dominoes and intercoms, all of which were culled from the Amsterdam Bakelite Collection, the holdings of Hugh Karraker, a great-grandson of Bakelites inventor, Leo Baekeland, and the Yonkers Historical Society.",2010-02-05T20:17:24+0000

The expansion is necessary partly because the museum is to be the home of the extensive art collection of Don and Doris Fisher, co-founders of the Gap clothing chain. The Fishers announced in September, shortly before Mr. Fishers death, that they would lend their works to the museum instead of placing them in a museum that they had planned to build in the Presidio in San Francisco. The modern art museum, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last month, also announced Thursday that the agreement for the Fisher loan would be extended from 25 years, as initially announced, to at least 100 years. The works will be presented in a new wing along with works from the museums permanent collection and will also be interwoven throughout the museums other galleries beginning in June. A search will now begin for an architect for the expansion and the museum will continue to work toward raising a total of $480 million for it and the endowment.",2010-02-05T22:50:47+0000

But the house where Hughes lived, at No. 20 East 127th, is no longer open to the public. In 2008 the owner evicted tenants who had been running an informal Hughes museum there and now the only trace of him is a plaque in front of the building, which has been a landmark since 1981. The Hughes legacy may have a better chance of taking hold in Cleveland, where a nonprofit development group has bought a foreclosed house in that citys Fairfax neighborhood, where Hughes lived for about two years starting in 1917. Hughes was in high school, living with his mother, and when she moved away he stayed on and rented an attic room at 2266 East 86th Street. According to Arnold Rampersads biography of Hughes, he said of his time at East 86th Street: I couldnt afford to eat in a restaurant, and the only thing I knew how to cook myself in the kitchen of the house where I roomed was rice, which I boiled to a paste. Rice and hot dogs, rice and hot dogs, every night for dinner. Then I read myself to sleep. The developer, Fairfax Renaissance Development Corporation, hasnt decided what to do with the property, which it picked up for $100 in November. One option, according to Jay Gardner, the groups community development director, is to fix it up for a private owner; another is to create a museum devoted to Hughes and his work.",2010-02-05T22:51:03+0000

Ascap was solely responsible for naming Bruce Springsteen as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, the statement said. Bruce Springsteen had no knowledge of this lawsuit, was not asked if he would participate as a named plaintiff, and would not have agreed to do so if he had been asked.

In a statement from her relayed by the Met, Ms. Gheorghiu implied that she was not ready for the role.

Therefore, I will postpone my role debut until a later date when I can work intensely with the Richard Eyre production. Ms. Gheorghiu withdrew from the first six performances, in which she was to have starred with her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, because of marital troubles. The tenor role (Don Jos) had been assigned to Jonas Kaufmann for the final two performances, on April 28 and May 1.

Kimball Petition Management does not want anyone to plant initiatives promoting a constitutional convention. Fred Kimball, who runs the petition firm, said he opposed such ballot initiatives and said he had warned independent managers that he would blacklist them if they work with Repair California, the Bay Area group promoting constitutional reform. One issue: the state constitutional convention, if it materializes, might remake the ballot initiative process. John Grubb, a spokesman for Repair California, said signature-gathering firms had blacklisted their petitions and shouted at their volunteers. Repair California has sent cease-and-desist letters to the major signature gathering firms. In the meantime, while those gathering signatures to put measures on the ballot usually carry multiple proposed propositions, some will not carry those two initiatives.

Alexander McQueen, who has cited Lady Gaga as an influence, recently showed an otherworldly collection accented with prosthetic makeup and podlike 10-inch reptilian platforms. Gareth Pugh also unleashed a legion of threatening, heavily powdered models in a broodingly romantic zombie romp, and Lanvins disturbing new ad campaign stars the photographers Vinoodh Matadin and Inez van Lamsweerde  the latter in full-body makeup that makes her look as if shes been skinned alive.Perhaps the house should consider a partnership with the jewelry designer Emily Miranda, whose chunky pieces feature flesh-ripping animal claws. The film world is also right on trend. Spike Jonze got things going with Where the Wild Things Are, which was followed by remakes of The Wolfman and, in theaters soon, A Nightmare on Elm Street. Natalie Portman has signed on for Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and Tim Burtons dark directorial oeuvre is being celebrated in a career retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art through April 26.

Guggenheim Museum said on Monday that it had reached an agreement with the heirs of the artist Kazimir Malevich over ownership of an untitled work by him that the museum plans to include in an exhibition this month. In a joint news release the foundation and the heirs of Malevich, the Russian Suprematist, said they had reached an amicable settlement over an oil painting he made around 1916, below left, which was acquired by Peggy Guggenheim in 1942 and has been part of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The painting is one of about 70 Malevich works presented at a Berlin exhibition in 1927, during which Malevich was called back to the Soviet Union and entrusted the works to several friends. He died in 1935, and his work was subsequently banned by the Nazis, but his paintings, drawings and other art have since become part of the collections of museums and private owners, setting the stage for efforts by his heirs to reclaim ownership of these works.The Guggenheim, which will show the untitled painting in an exhibition called Malevich in Focus: 1912-1922, said in a statement that the terms of the settlement were confidential. A representative of the Malevich heirs said in a statement that the family is gratified that this matter has been resolved in a way that acknowledges Malevichs legacy and his contributions to the history of 20th-century art and keeps his artwork on public display.",2010-02-08T21:35:00+0000

us,Inside Out | Depth of Field,"Rita Konig is a decorator based in New York who has written about style for British Vogue, The Telegraph and Domino.I find that one of the keys to giving a living room a feeling of depth and substance is to have something  like a piece of furniture  visible behind the sofa or chairs. It leads your eye into the distance, giving the room that third dimension it so often lacks. I spent last Friday with a client, moving furniture around. The newly upholstered furniture was arriving in her living room, the first phase in the transformation of a room that has been long-unused into one that can be enjoyed on a daily basis. Behind the new pair of club chairs, we put a chest of drawers between two windows. The room immediately felt substantial in a way it hadnt before, as well as very cozy and warm. (This is also an excellent way to use a piece of furniture that your parents gave you, and which has sentimental value but which is not necessarily to your own taste. Not every piece in a room needs to be your absolute favorite thing; in fact, it is usually preferable for at least one thing not to be.)When chairs or sofas just sit in front of a wall, the space behind them can look rather sad. At home, I have been struggling with the depressing nest of cables and air of general neglect behind my club chair. But what was putting a monkey wrench in the decorating works was that I didnt need a table there  there is already a desk nearby  so I left it until finally it came to me. What I wanted, I realized as I put the last of a small stack of logs on the fire, was a really big log basket. I love log baskets, and it has been something I have wanted for a long time. They look so good in rooms, and, in the same way that bookcases and drinks trays do, they imply civilized living is going on!",2010-02-09T16:29:06+0000

The Variety report said that Mr. Rays screenplay would likely be set in Europe (where clocks are already set to 24-hour time). 24 is now in its eighth season on Fox, which has not yet officially ordered a ninth season of the show; Variety cautioned that a possible movie could be put on hold if the Fox network passes on the television series.",2010-02-09T17:21:23+0000

The announcement follows the dismissal in December of the festivals executive director, Michael Dewitte, who is now being sought by the police on charges that he misused its funds and put its money into foreign bank accounts. Last week, The Independent said, the festivals technical chief, Klaus Kretschmer, was found unconscious under a bridge in Salzburg, and is believed to have attempted suicide after being accused of charging the festival for non-existent services. Over all, the festival may have been defrauded of as much as $2.75 million. It is scheduled to open on March 27, and feature Simon Rattle conducting a production of  what else?

At issue is a commercial for the Air Force Reserve, set to an instrumental track that the White Stripes say is an unauthorized version of their song Fell in Love With a Girl. At the Web site of its record label, Third Man Records (thirdmanrecords.com), the band juxtaposed the video for that song with a link to the commercial, inviting listeners to judge for themselves. In a statement posted Monday evening, the White Stripes wrote: We believe our song was re-recorded and used without permission of the White Stripes, our publishers, label or management. The White Stripes take strong insult and objection to the Air Force Reserve presenting this advertisement with the implication that we licensed one of our songs to encourage recruitment during a war that we do not support. The Air Force Reserve said in a statement that its ad agency, Blaine Warren Advertising, had hired Fast Forward Music of Salt Lake City to score original music for its commercial and that there was never any intention to utilize any existing music or to sound like any music by the band White Stripes or any other musical performer.

Mr. McSweeney, 67, was a painter who fell victim to alcoholism and mental illness and spent much of his later life in hospitals. The death was disclosed on the McSweeneys Web site, mcsweeneys.net. Mr. McSweeney began writing letters to Mr. Eggers, then a boy, and his mother, whose maiden name was McSweeney, believing they were all related. Mr. Eggers did not know whether someone named Timothy McSweeney actually existed but was fascinated by the mystery of those letters, and the feeling stayed palpable enough that in 1998 he named his new literary journal Timothy McSweeneys Quarterly Concern. Since then Mr. Eggerss enterprise has grown to be a publisher of books, magazines and online content in addition to the original journal, known collectively as McSweeneys. A few years after the journal began, a young man, Ross McSweeney, came to work for Mr. Eggers as an intern. He turned out to be Timothys nephew. Knowing that the journal bore the name of a real person who had endured years of struggle threw melancholy shadows over the enterprise, Mr. Eggers wrote on the McSweeneys site. But the McSweeneys insisted that the use of the name was acceptable, even appropriate, given Timothys background as an artist and search for connection and meaning through the written word.

In the Heights was one of five major musicals  along with Fela!, Memphis, Next to Normal and South Pacific  that had declines of 10 percent or more in their grosses last week, though a cold snap and Super Bowl Sunday were probably factors. While Rialto gossip has speculated about finances for Hair, the show has already recouped and has a $2.5 million advance with tickets on sale through Labor Day, said Jeffrey Richards, one of the lead producers.

Go for the pastas, which are just ridiculous: perfectly prepared, full of flavor, a rejoinder to low expectations. Try a plate of gramigna alla carbonara, for instance, thin strands of curled pasta with eggs, pecorino romano, guanciale and black pepper. It arrives on the table as a riot of simplicity, a four-member noise band. It is outstanding, firm and pliant, salty and sweet, slick and sticky and rich.

Lil Wayne, the multiplatinum-selling performer whose real name is Dwayne Carter, appeared in State Supreme Court, where he was to be sentenced on charges stemming from a July 2007 incident in which a loaded .40-caliber semiautomatic gun was found on his tour bus. He pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon in October.

us,The Margiela Sale to End All Margiela Sales,"Starting tomorrow, Resurrections 20 Years of Maison Martin Margiela: The Marcia Berger Collection will be on view at One Jackson Square in downtown Manhattan. The more than 1,000 mint-condition accessories and garments will then go up for auction, in a collaboration between the vintage clothing resource and 1stdibs. There has been a fair amount said about Bergers collection, which includes some 40 one-of-a-kind artisanal pieces, like a top made from vintage opera gloves, a dress-form top and a sweater made from military socks; the collection spans the designers career from 1989 up until the time he was rumored to be phoning his work in from Ibiza, Spain. But just who is the woman who assembled  and never wore!  this Margiela trove? A quick search yields little on Berger, who is occasionally described as a fashion doyenne. This is a fair enough assumption for someone who in her lifetime (she died in 2008) amassed enough high-end and avant-garde clothing to fuel multiple sales. (Resurrection already sold off her stash of shoes  Alaia, Yohji, Louboutin, Manolo Blahnik, etc.  in 2008. She was a size 8/8.5 in case you were wondering.) Yet, to hear Resurrections Mark Haddawy describe her, she was anything but doyenne-ish. Quite the opposite in fact. Like most L.A. women, Berger was typically dressed-down and favored a uniform of jeans, a Margiela AIDS T-shirt and flip-flops. She drove a Ford Taurus. Unlike the python-clad L.A. fashion cowboy Jim Goldstein, Berger was not a front-row fixture on the show circuit. Yet, no doubt when she walked into stores like Laura Urbinati or Maxfield or Mameg, her salespeoples eyes would light up. Its an amazing collection put together in real time, says Haddawy, who with Katy Rodriguez was responsible for organizing and cataloging the contents of Bergers closets. To the untrained eye, he adds, many of the pieces looked like they should have been tossed in the trash. They were ripped, burned, wrinkled or otherwise damaged.

But the report says the regions troubles go beyond the current job picture and the area could lose its competitive edge. Let me give you a few snapshots in despair, wrote Chris OBrien, in a column in The San Jose Mercury News. The venture capital industry is collapsing. Our educational system is failing.

David Cromer, the plays director, stood near the entrance to Barneys New York. He looked partly excited, because this was his big break, his Broadway debut, coming on the heels of his Off Broadway triumph: the imaginatively staged, emotionally transcendent production of Our Town. At the same time he looked partly miserable, because that is what David Cromer does for a living when hes not directing. There was no particular reason for misery  at this juncture of his life, at least. But old habits die hard, so there he was, on the outside looking in, a gray knit cap pulled over his hair, wearing a well-worn tweed jacket, gray corduroy pants that had never seen an iron and Pumas. Though these clothes came from J. Crew and the Gap, Cromers wardrobe tends to span a palette of odd colors  rare shades of mustard or something that is not quite brown, the sartorial equivalent of mystery meat  so its no surprise to learn that he has long shopped at secondhand stores.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles must hand over a rare bronze statue that has been at the heart of a four-decade dispute. Judge Lorena Mussoni decreed that the statue, Victorious Youth, left, must be confiscated from the museum and transferred immediately to the Italian government, which the ruling said was its rightful owner. Maurizio Fiorilli, a lawyer for the government, said the ruling was a confirmation that the Getty had not acted in good faith when they bought the statue, which was found by Italian fishermen in the Adriatic in 1964 and bought by the Getty in 1977 for almost $4 million. The Italian justice ministry must now make a formal request to American authorities to execute the court order. The work, a second- or third-century B.C. sculpture of an athlete, known as the Getty Bronze, had been excluded from a 2007 agreement between Italy and the Getty for the return of 40 artifacts that Italy said had been looted, pending the court decision. The Italian culture ministry said on Thursday that it hoped the Getty would now review that accord and that it would return the statue in light of this ruling. The Getty said a statement that the court order was flawed both procedurally and substantively. The museum said it would appeal to Italys highest court and vigorously defend its legal ownership of the statue.",2010-02-11T21:29:20+0000

In fact Mr. Lewis, a contributing writer for Vanity Fair and The New York Times Magazine, should be riding twice as high right now: not only is Moneyball apparently back on track  with Brad Pitt still set to star and Bennett Miller (Capote) to direct  but, according to New York magazine, Mr. Pitt has optioned Mr. Lewiss next book, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, about the housing bubble.

But it somehow doesnt seem surprising enough. Could it be Gretzky and Gordie Howe, who met him when Gretzky was a small boy and was a present, guardian angel-like, at all the key points in his career?

It has forged bag collaborations with the designer Bruno Pieters, the model Hannelore Knuts and the Belgian avant-gardist Natalia Brilli, who wraps watches and objects in taut lambskin. But Delvauxs biggest score to date was hiring Veronique Branquinho as artistic director. Its a legendary brand with a great history, says Branquinho, who in addition to reworking existing classics is introducing several new bag styles for spring  most notably a deep-blue duffel and a buttery beige envelope (right).

us,Pride and Avarice,"When the first wave of novelists began to tackle the post-9/11 world, many critics marveled (and some jeered) that theyd done it so soon. In 2005, Jonathan Safran Foers Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and Ian McEwans Saturday were in the vanguard. Since then, new works touching on our jittery times have appeared with increasing frequency. And yet, almost a decade after the cataclysm, it can still strike a reader as portentous or premature when the somber shadow of that day falls across the pages of contemporary fiction. So its with surprise, even incredulity, that you grasp, as you read Adam Hasletts first novel, that this book, set chiefly in 2002, not only tucks 9/11 into its narrative in an uncowed, offhand way but, to an extent, leaves it behind. Instead, Haslett tracks a different calamity: the global economic crisis that accelerated after 2001, propelled by bad mortgages, bad financial instruments, bad regulations and bad faith. As Doug Fanning, the protagonist (in no way a hero) of Union Atlantic, curtly observes, recapping the trajectory that made him rich, the attacks on 9/11 only sped the trend. So much for the halcyon pre-9/11 mind-set. This novels narrative history doubles as news analysis. ",2010-02-12T16:40:20+0000

As he sees it, the standard account of the history textbooks  with the Renaissance giving rise to the Scientific Revolution and thus preparing the way for the Enlightenment  fails to identify the primary causal relationship. Democratic governance and individual rights did not emerge from some amorphous brew of humanistic and scientific thinking, he argues, but were sparked by science itself  the crucial innovative ingredient that continues to foster political freedom today.

That decision rises from the latest legal wrangling in Los Angeles, where a State Superior Court judge insisted in a January hearing that Mr. Polanski must return to the United States before his case can be concluded. A California appeals court had suggested a few weeks earlier that Mr. Polanski could be sentenced in absentia.  Rudolf Wyss, a spokesman for the Swiss ministry, said the authorities were waiting for a clear decision on the question of an in absentia trial. Bart P. Dalton, one of Mr. Polanskis American lawyers, said only that any new appeal would have to be filed by March 24. In a statement, the Los Angeles County district attorneys office said it was reviewing news reports from Switzerland, and added: At present, this rests with the Swiss courts. We will comment after a ruling by the courts there, not before. Mr. Polanski, 76, remains under house arrest in his Swiss chalet.

Valentines Day (Warner Brothers/New Line) was a strong No. 1 with $52.4 million. The comedy, directed by Garry Marshall, succeeded partly because its ensemble cast of 18 stars, including Julia Roberts, Ashton Kutcher and Shirley MacLaine, appealed to all ages. Most date films primarily attract teenagers. Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, based on the young-adult novels by Rick Riordan, was second with about $31.1 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. Some critics said that film, a fantasy from 20th Century Fox, was a knockoff of the Harry Potter franchise, but Fox played up the similarity in advertisements, a decision that box-office analysts said probably paid off. The Wolfman (Universal Pictures) was third with about $30.6 million, a weak opening for such an expensive endeavor  budget estimates range from $110 million to $150 million  but better than some analysts had anticipated given negative chatter on the Internet. Avatar (Fox) was fourth with about $22 million for a new domestic total of $659.6 million, while the tear-jerker Dear John (Relativity/Sony) was fifth with about $15.3 million ($53.2 million total).",2010-02-14T23:31:58+0000

The next was If I Could Only Remember My Name, David Crosbys first solo album, followed by Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon. The newspaper published its list on Saturday, before the start of the San Remo festival, an over-the-top Italian competition of pop music that is widely watched on television. The rest of the list: Rumors by Fleetwood Mac; The Nightfly by Donald Fagen of Steely Dan; Thriller by Michael Jackson; Paul Simons Graceland; Achtung Baby by U2; (Whats the Story) Morning Glory by Oasis; and Carlos Santanas Supernatural. The writers of the article ended with a shot at Bob Dylan, praising his great poetic vein but saying he was excluded from the list for a major fault: paving the way for generations of dilettante singer-songwriters who have harshly tested the ears and patience of listeners, thinking that their tortured meanderings might interest somebody.",2010-02-14T23:38:32+0000

us,In Focus | Richard Misrach,"Richard Misrachs large-scale photographs now on view at PaceWildenstein are stunning examples of landscape photography, but not for the reason you might think. These are not the ominous aerial views of beaches or the desert vistas weve come to know as his work. Instead, all of the images in this show have been inverted to resemble enormous color negatives. While the environments are still recognizable, many of the photos  like one in which a lone figure appears like a specter in the distance  seem almost supernatural. Misrach shot most of these landscapes and seascapes with an advanced digital camera and then reversed the positive captures to transform them into strange and incongruous settings. The bluish rocks strewn along a craggy shoreline look more like icebergs. Not only does the series continue Misrachs probing exploration of the natural world, but it also reminds us of the rapid demise of analog photography  this is, after all, Misrachs first showing of digital prints. At a time when more and more photographers are embracing digital technologies, its nice to see work that bridges the mediums past and present.",2010-02-16T18:11:23+0000

Both shows still earned less than two-thirds of their maximum possible potential grosses, however. The musical revival Hair, which has also seen a decline  in ticket sales recently, also increased its grosses by $111,744, to $593,128, though swaths of seats still went empty at some performances.

On Tuesday, publicists for the trans-Atlantic production of La Bte, which is performed in rhymed verse, said that it will star David Hyde Pierce, top right (as the high-brow playwright Elomire, whose name is an anagram for Molire); Mark Rylance, center right (as Valere, the low-brow street entertainer); and Joanna Lumley, right (as a princess who comes between them). The play, to be directed by Matthew Warchus (a Tony Award winner for God of Carnage), will be presented at the Comedy Theater in London from June 26 to Aug. 28 before it heads to an as-yet-undetermined Shubert theater in the fall. La Bte was previously performed on Broadway at the Eugene ONeill Theater in 1991, where its cast included Michael Cumpsty, Tom McGowan and Dylan Baker.

The restaurant, which has locations in Brooklyn and the East Village, has attracted culinary celebrities like Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who run the Frankies's restaurants, and Rachel Ray. Made to the chef Mathieu Palombino's specifications and ""cooked in the tempering heat of a wood fire, his crust emerges from the oven as a Neapolitan fantasy of crispness that is also pillowy and soft, sweet but not sugared, tangy without too much salt."" Multiple visits to the restaurants conform: ""Motorino pies are great hot out of the oven, five minutes later, 10. You can order too much, watch a pie go cool on the plate, eat it anyway and discover: terrific. You can order pizzas to take out, drive them across the boroughs in freezing conditions, get home and reheat the pies: still terrific.

I wanted to prove that women can do conflict, she told The Guardian, that they can write big structures, big stories because Ive heard it too many times that women arent as good at that.

And yet there are still those glass-half-empty Republicans who insist on reminding their colleagues that the party is beset by serious problems. It has no discernible governing agenda, for one thing. The partys chairman, Michael Steele, makes Howard Dean look like a model of reticence, and its most charismatic leader is a former governor of a small state  unless you count the caribou  who seems more interested in celebrity than in policy. And its establishment is under siege from furious activists who seem to regard all government as tyranny. And so this month a cadre of conservative donors and policy makers  they include the former Minnesota senator Norm Coleman and the economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin  stepped forward with an answer to all this: a brand-new think tank. Actually, the American Action Network, as Coleman described it to The Timess Jackie Calmes, is supposed to be a think-and-do tank, meaning that its mission is not only to synthesize the Republican argument but to aggressively market it as well.",2010-02-18T21:50:56+0000

It was the first time that the formidable Idol lost to any show on television in almost six years, ending a winning streak of an amazing 222 editions of Idol. The victory for NBC was clearly fueled by early news reports Wednesday that Lindsey Vonn, above, the star American skier, had staged an exciting comeback run on the downhill course despite a shin injury. The coverage of the race proved the highlight of NBCs night, and it was placed dead against Idol in the 9 p.m. hour. In the overnight national ratings, the Olympics averaged 30.1 million viewers in the hour between 9 and 10 p.m., by far the biggest night of the games so far, and an increase of 47 percent over the same night four years ago in Turin, Italy. Idol had a still potent but distant second-place total of 18.4 million viewers.

In a statement Ms. Rowling said she was saddened that yet another claim has been made that I have taken material from another source to write Harry.

Days later, Ruth Padel became the first woman in more than 300 years to win the seat. But she quickly resigned after it was learned she had sent e-mail messages alerting reporters about The Lecherous Professor. Oxford will take nominations for the professorship, a prestigious position with a salary of less than $11,000 a year, through May 5, after which its graduates can vote for a favorite.

For Google, Mountain View is part home and part beta-testing ground.

The San Diego Comic-Con International, the 40-year-old event that has evolved into a required pit stop for film studios, television networks and comics publishers who are preparing geek-friendly projects, could leave its longtime home base after 2012, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The contract between the San Diego Convention Center and the organizers of the convention, which brings 126,000 attendees and millions of dollars to the city, ends after 2012. Though the corporation that runs the convention hall recently sent a proposal to the organizers seeking to extend their agreement through 2015, the growing number of convention-goers and the finite space of the convention center could spell trouble. The city of Anaheim, which is closer for Hollywood-based executives and talent, has made a competing bid to become the conventions new home. In response, The Union-Tribune said, three waterfront hotels in San Diego have offered 300,000 square feet of their meeting space to the convention free of charge for 2013 through 2015.

The premise may not be everyone's idea of a fun night out, but just trust us on this one. Tonight, Riccardo Muti, the former music director and conductor of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, will make his long-awaited debut at the Metropolitan Opera, conducting the Verdi work. ""I find 'Attila' a very mysterious but exquisitely defined score,"" Mr. Muti said in a recent interview. ""In the prologue, as the Roman general Ezio plots with Attila to divide up the empire between them, Ezio sings, 'Avrai tu l'universo, resti l'Italia a me!' 'You can have the universe, leave Italy for me!' One can just imagine the effect that line must have had in 1846, delivered by the baritone over his full octave-and-a-half range. The first performance stopped dead and the audience went absolutely crazy."" This will be the company's first production of the early opera, directed by Pierre Audi, and it's worth going just to see the sets and costumes, designed by Herzog & de Meuron and Miuccia Prada.

""For the Coltrane piece,"" Gia Kourlas writes, ""Mr. Lubovitch found inspiration in a 1963 live recording from a Copenhagen performance of the saxophonist's effervescent interpretation of Richard Rodgers's 'My Favorite Things.' "" ""I've known the piece of music for a long time,"" Mr. Lubovitch said. ""It was only recently that I felt I could manage it. I like to imagine that I am not doing anything that's exactly to the music. I'm trying to write the visual line of the score that capitulates to everything but doesn't copy it."" Mr. Lubovitch never studied jazz dance, but jazz is where he feels at home; the sound, as he put it, ""assaults my solar plexus and causes a response in the rest of my body.""

Its like Aspen was back in the 70s, but less pretentious, said Bo Bedford, a self-described Aspen refugee who is a manager at the New Sheridan Hotel. It hasnt gone Hollywood yet. There is, of course, a certain star-studded film festival. And Telluride does count Jerry Seinfeld and Tom Cruise among its regulars. Yet, the town stays true to its hardscrabble roots.

Only 100 copies of Action No. 1 are believed to still exist. Comic books are now in the same realm as fine art, one-of-a-kind jewels and antiques, Vincent Zurzolo, chief operating officer and co-owner of Comic Connect, said.

Set in the Great Depression and named for a popular song of the era, the artist duos first scripted film chronicles the disastrous end of an affair. McDermott and McGough began collaborating 30 years ago, and capturing the essence of a time past has always been part of their work, so recreating the 1930s proved no challenge. Period-perfect down to its wallpaper, telephone and radio, McGoughs Art Deco Manhattan apartment provided the set. Deyns costumes, by Zac Posen, might as well be of that vintage. The Shalimar perfume and pearls, around which crucial plot points turn, were courtesy of Guerlain and Mikimoto, which underwrote the project.

Plans for the revival, reported in The New York Post on Wednesday, call for a Broadway opening during the 2011-12 season, and the show could start performances as late as the spring of 2012, said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the producers had not permitted details to be made public. While the producers have faith in Ms. Roger to deliver a star turn as Eva Pern in the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical, the executive said, they are also looking for a household name to play Che Guevara. An offer had been made to the singer and actor Ricky Martin, but he had not accepted as of Wednesday afternoon, the executive said.

The suit arose from the death of Jerry Amaro, who was arrested in 2000 in East Oakland and died a month afterward after claiming he had been beaten by the police. Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court wrote that misleading statements and conduct by the police made soon after Mr. Amaros death discouraged his mother, Geraldine Montoya, from filing a wrongful death lawsuit. The family filed a lawsuit in 2009, but the city had argued that the statute of limitations had passed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting a separate inquiry into whether or not the police covered up the circumstances surrounding Mr. Amaros death.

us,The Christian Tories,"For anyone interested in reading more about the state of British conservatism, I highly recommend this big Financial Times piece on the influence of evangelical Christians  and particularly Tim Montgomerie, the founder of the prominent ConservativeHome website  in David Camerons Tory Party. Its thick with heavy breathing about the perils of religious influence on politics, but mostly that comes from old-guard Conservative apparatchiks quoted sniping at Montgomerie, rather than from the authors own editorializing. Overall, the story strikes me as a fair-minded look at the attempt to forge a distinctively Christian approach to right-of-center politics  and to do so in a country where religious believers are a distinct minority, and evangelicals are particularly marginal. There are echoes of the religious right and Bush-esque compassionate conservatism in what Montgomerie and Co. are up to, but also striking differences as well.

In films like Ferris Buellers Day Off, Dazed and Confused and High School Musical 3, senior year is a do-little sabbatical from what is presented as the long dull labor of acquiring knowledge, honing skills and internalizing social norms. Its a spree, senior year, that discharges built-up tensions. Its an adolescent Mardi Gras. And its not an indulgence but an entitlement. Remember that line in your yearbook? Seniors rule! And they rule not because theyve accomplished much, necessarily (aside from surviving to age 18 or so and not dropping out or running away from home), but because its tradition, and seniors crave tradition. They crave it because they know, deep down, theyre lost, and tradition helps them hide this fear. From juniors.",2010-02-25T15:59:01+0000

Donors often look favorably on such cooperation, so the development puts management in a better position to raise funds from individuals and foundations. The orchestra said it had raised $8 million toward a $15 million emergency fund needed to stabilize its finances. The players agreed to give up a 4.8 percent raise next season, accept a freeze in pension contributions from the orchestra and allow a hiring freeze, although principal-player openings may be filled, management said. The savings could add up to about $4.5 million next year, in addition to a similar amount from concessions last season, the orchestra said. Orchestra musicians around the country have been making similar concessions since the recession, which shrunk endowments and donations. A Philadelphia performers minimum salary this season is $124,800, although all make more than that  and some two or three times that amount. That minimum ranks sixth among the major orchestras; a freeze next year would drop it a notch to seventh, according to current contract figures.",2010-02-26T23:15:35+0000
