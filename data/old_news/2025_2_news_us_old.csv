The designer has brought this ethos of cherishing well-made garments that can [be passed down] for many generations to her own brand, which she started after earning her masters from Central Saint Martins in London last year. With her graduate collection, Maktabi paid homage to her design heroes, such as the French couturiers Madame Grs and Madeleine Vionnet, who were masters of draping, using the technique on silk tops and georgette dresses. These appeared alongside cowhide leather jackets and softly tailored trousers, all in a limited palette of cream, chocolate brown and black. Later this spring in London, she will present a trunk show of her fall 2025 collection, which she says is a bit dreamier, freer and more evening-focused. Each item will be custom-made, she says, allowing the garments to truly belong to the person wearing them. Though her home country of Lebanon was most recently hit by a series of Israeli airstrikes, Maktabi has trained herself to remain focused on her work: As Lebanese people, resilience is ingrained in us, she says.

Ford, the 38th president of the United States, was a football star at the University of Michigan and, as Susan Morrison puts it in Lorne, her new biography of Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live, a man of some physical grace. If hes remembered otherwise, as a singularly clumsy occupant of the White House, its because his brief administration happened to coincide with the first seasons of the show, in the mid-1970s. On S.N.L., Chevy Chase, a comedian with no special talent for impressions and a knack for pratfalls, played Ford as a man locked in a perpetual losing battle with gravity, crashing through a Christmas tree, a press-conference podium and his Oval Office desk.",2025-02-12T10:01:43+0000

Theres a reason no one has tried second versions of Fellinis 8 or Coppolas The Godfather or Polanskis Chinatown. In the case of Fellinis achievement, is someone going to produce a more harrowing portrait of the self-deluding toxicity of male narcissism? In the case of Coppolas, of the corrosive effects of power? Or in the case of Polanskis, of the Hey-nothing-personal malevolence of late-model capitalism?

us,La Dolce Villa Review: Sweet Italian Nonsense,"From the start, I had many questions about La Dolce Villa, directed by Mark Waters, most of which are easy enough to answer but stick in the mind nonetheless. Why, for instance, is the hot middle-aged dad, Eric (Scott Foley), so incredibly mad at his 20-something daughter, Olivia (Maia Reficco), for wanting to purchase a literal villa in Italy for the whopping price of one euro? Why, for that matter, is her Italian so good? Why does Eric seem so convinced the one-euro Italian villa situation is a complete scam, despite, presumably, living in a world that has the internet? Why does everyone in the tiny, remote, fictional town of Montezara, in which this villa can be found, speak extremely accomplished, crystal-clear English? And why does it feel like La Dolce Villa is actually funded by an Italian tourist bureau?",2025-02-13T10:01:42+0000

The electricity was faulty, forcing my children to use a flashlight to climb a steep stairwell, and the Wi-Fi didnt work, requiring us to spend about $200 on international data. For workers to come fix the Wi-Fi, we were instructed to leave the key in a lockbox. (The lights were never fixed.) Two days later, we returned in the afternoon to find our apartment had been robbed, with a laptop, clothing and other items missing. Its not clear how the thief accessed the building  he would have had to get through two gates with key codes  but we think we know how he got in the door. We found a key to the apartment under the doormat! We spent two days filing reports with the police, who were very thorough and ended up catching the thief. (He was sentenced to six months in prison.) But although Airbnb advertises its insurance coverage on its site, its agents had us running around in circles before finally advising us they would not compensate us. Our insurance eventually paid us about $4,000 for our lost goods, but we believe that should have been Airbnbs responsibility, and that the company should credit us for our ruined stay and pay us back for the data.

Wearing mostly green-and-yellow hats  the color combination is said to represent either family and hope or faith and wisdom, depending on which milliner you ask  young people from the Parisian luxury houses gather at City Hall to celebrate St. Catherines Day, a Catholic holiday dating to the Middle Ages that was first observed by the couture industry in the late 19th century. Historically, the Catherinettes, as theyre known  single women, each 25 years old and working in one of the citys then-dozens of haute couture ateliers  were granted a rare opportunity to meet their bosses before getting the rest of the day off to enjoy street parties, all while wearing opulent, often garish hats that were sometimes personalized to represent their individual skills or interests, or at least their houses codes. (In the late 1940s, Schiaparellis Catherinettes wore oversize versions of the designer Elsa Schiaparellis surreal fragrance bottles in the shape of suns and candlesticks.) Though only midway through their 20s, the Catherinettes were already considered spinsters, and their hats sent a clear message: Im available, says Sophie Kurkdjian, an assistant professor of fashion history at the American University of Paris. And Im looking for a husband.

And what about those stirring in a lower part of her body? She convinces her partner, William (Nick Robinson), to chuck the vitamin. Their libidos now unleashed, the couple fumblingly discover the magic of sex along with heretofore unknown sensations like jealousy. The script by Angela Bourassa (whose If You Were the Last, from 2023, was an underrated rom-com in space) has some blind spots: Are there really not any books or movies in this world that feature sex or even romance, even allusively?

In 1962, as a student at Cooper Union, he became one of the first artists to settle below Canal Street, at an address on the corner of Lispenard and Church that had once belonged to the abolitionist David Ruggles and been a stop on the Underground Railroad. Frederick Douglass had stayed there for a few days in 1838 after escaping from Maryland in disguise. Whitten occupied the space for 40 years, engaged in an endless exploration of abstract painting that, as he put it near the end of his life, went beyond the general notions of race, gender, nationalism. His work influenced generations of artists  from Andy Warhol to Glenn Ligon  but looked like nothing else before or since. He knew everyone who passed through the downtown art scene: Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Norman Lewis, Louise Bourgeois, Kate Millett, Bob Thompson, Ishmael Reed, James Baldwin, John Coltrane, Alma Thomas, Jasper Johns, Amiri Baraka, Jean-Michel Basquiat.

I dont use face wash in the morning  I prefer not to wash off all the moisture that Ive tried to put into my skin the night before. If theres dry weather, Ill use a light serum, like Le Srum from Diors Capture line, or 111Skins Vitamin C Booster. Other times Ill just wear my Cl de Peau SPF 50+ sunblock. The color is this soft pink, and its incredibly creamy, so it feels like youre putting on moisturizer. Im a fan of dry brushing, and Im a really big lover of a steam. Ill add some eucalyptus essential oil and do some breathing. I have a giant bottle of the Kiehls grapefruit body wash that lasts forever. When I get out of the shower, I do a pretty solid skin routine. I start with the Koh Gen Do Cleansing Spa Water. Then I put on a hydrogel face mask and use the Dior Prestige Le Ptale tool lightly over it  it might be the totally wrong way to do it, but I really like it. I love all the Capture serums, and Ill alternate between the Retishot and Hyalushot, which I only use once or twice a week because it lasts. And I love the Capture Totale Intensive Restorative Night Creme. I want something thats got a heavy tone to it when I go to bed because in the morning it feels like Im just saturated with moisture.
