That Azinger was 10 shots out of the lead held by Fred Funk's 66 in the Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Mich., mattered not at all to the gallery that cheered him as he started play and stood to applaud at the 18th hole as he made the turn to the front nine. ""Physically, I'm tired and emotionally I'm tapped out,"" Azinger said. ""After that big ovation at the start, I just walked around in a bit of a haze for a while. I think tomorrow will probably be a little bit easier."" Pavin and Russ Cochran shared second at 68. (AP) King Holds Lead Despite Triple Bogey: Betsy King survived a disastrous triple-bogey 7 on the 12th hole and raw weather yesterday to retain a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the McCall's L.P.G.A. Classic in Stratton Mountain, Vt. Nancy Ramsbottom birdied her final hole for a second 69 and 138. (AP) PRO FOOTBALL Faulk Off and Running for the Colts The rookie running back Marshall Faulk set up two first-half field goals, and Leonard Humphries returned a pass interception 52 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter as the Indianapolis Colts beat the Seattle Seahawks, 13-9, last night in Indianapolis. Faulk, the second player taken in the National Football League draft last spring, rushed for 38 yards on 15 carries. (AP) Patriots Take the Handoff: Taking advantage of an opponent as sloppy as the rainy weather, the New England Patriots opened their preseason with a 24-6 romp over the fumbling New Orleans Saints in Foxboro, Mass. The Patriots scored all their points on short drives following New Orleans turnovers. The Saints fumbled four times and were intercepted twice. (AP) HORSE RACING Dispute Wins in Her Return Dispute, one of the country's prize fillies of 1993, made a smashing comeback to the races yesterday after four months on the sideline as she outran three rivals by six lengths at Saratoga Race Course. The 4-year-old daughter of Danzig didn't get to run on the grass as planned by her trainer, Shug McGaughey, since rains forced all the turf races onto the dirt track, causing many scratches. In fact, the field of 12 was reduced to just 4. But Jerry Bailey led Dispute to an easy victory as she ran the mile and an eighth in 1:523/5 as the 1-5 favorite, finishing a half-dozen lengths ahead of Avie's Daisy. EMPIRE STATE GAMES Three Female Gold Medalists Repeat Three reigning track and field gold medalists held onto their medals at the 1994 Empire State Games at Syracuse yesterday.

Officers now wear their shoes shined like Marine boots and their hair as short as golf course fairways. Where spotty supervision once led to illegal drug searches, today there is at least one sergeant at every drug arrest. Life in the precinct has changed, and many say it is for the better. Page 1. EDUCATION BILL PASSES, THEN LANGUISHES It was a measure to require large cities to spend about the same amount of local money on schools as they had in previous years. Lawmakers publicly endorsed it (good for education), privately denounced it (badly drafted) and ultimately passed the bill. Now it sits in legislative limbo. Lawmakers don't want to send the bill to Governor Cuomo, Mr. Cuomo hasn't asked for it, and the reasons say much about Albany's partisan politics in an election year. Page 1.

Think of instrumental music as sound without morals. The key of B flat doesn't lie, cheat or steal; it's just there. When music starts incorporating people, how they behave becomes an issue. Operas, for example, tell stories about how good or bad their characters are. Because goodness and badness vary wildly, depending on who is proclaiming the first or denying the second, every opera needs a reference point to tell the two apart. That point, I think, can reside only in the composer. The idea of good for Berlioz, even when applied to an opera about ancient Troy, is an idea of good mutually understood by him and his fellow Frenchmen in the 1850's.",1994-08-07T05:00:00+0000

A generation later, the nanny-hiring scene has become a staple of movies and television shows for the yuppie set. Never mind whether Mom is working, whether Mom has died or whether Dad wants the kids. It is always the same scene. Open with a parent and the nanny candidate engaged in awkward chitchat, with the nanny facing the camera. Nanny makes a bizarre remark. Cut to the next nanny. And the next, with each one worse than the one before. At last, the golden moment: the arrival of what appears to be baby-sitter perfection. Just to keep working parents feeling guilty, some of these nannies turn out to be serial killers or, at best, pitifully inadequate substitutes for Mom. -- Susan Chira The Situation:",1994-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,A Slipping Glimpser,"If there is a theme to WILLEM DE KOONING: Paintings (National Gallery of Art/Yale University, $55), it is the slipperiness -- in all senses -- of the artist. His paints were slippery. His brushwork was slippery. His paintings seemed to elide into one another. And he called himself a ""slipping glimpser."" Of his predilection for slippery paints (he was known to mix his pigments with safflower oil), Mr. de Kooning said, ""I like a nice, juicy, greasy surface."" The oil extended the usual drying time, allowing him to work his paintings over and over. Even when a painting was done (or at least gone), bits and pieces of it would crop up in later paintings, because Mr. de Kooning -- as Richard Shiff, a professor of art history at the University of Texas, Austin, points out -- made tracings, photographs and oil transfers of certain passages in his paintings, creating a ""yogurt,"" a culture from which he could generate new works. However, despite Mr. de Kooning's tenacity, his seven decades of work (a lucid chronology by Marla Prather, an associate curator of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of Art, covers the years 1938 to 1986) show several transformations: the somber clay-colored portraits of the 30's gave way to the urban-inspired abstractions of the 40's, then to the bug-eyed, buck-toothed women of the 50's, then to the pastoral Long Island abstractions and the more comical bug-eyed women of the 60's, and finally to the wispy ribbons of the 70's and 80's that trail, sadly, into no painting at all. (Mr. de Kooning, who is 90 years old, is no longer painting.) Though the artist has his themes, shuttling back and forth between women and landscapes, between figures and abstractions, there is always change and always slipping. ""When I'm falling,"" he said to the English art historian David Sylvester in 1960, ""I am doing all right. And when I am slipping I say, 'Hey, this is very interesting.' . . . That is a wonderful sensation . . . to slip into this glimpse."" As you can see from this sensuous book, Mr. de Kooning was quite right: it is wonderful slipping into this glimpse.

The West has indicated it will ease its embargo on Serbia if it cuts ties to the Bosnian Serbs. 1 Serbs continued attacks in the area near Sarajevo. 9 CRITICISM OF ARAFAT Yasir Arafat has taken a series of actions to restrict freedoms, leading to growing disappointment among Palestinians since he took over the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 1 TALE OF SAUDI ARMS RACE A former Saudi diplomat seeking asylum in the United States says that Saudi Arabia tried for 20 years to acquire nuclear weapons and that it conducts nuclear research. 20 Warren Christopher began a trip to promote Mideast peace. 20 REFUGEES IN RWANDA STARVING Thousands of refugees in the French-established safe zone in southwestern Rwanda are desperately in need of aid, while the world's focus has been on those in Zaire. 3 FACING AIDS IN JAPAN Insular Japan has sheltered itself from the AIDS epidemic, but the international conference on AIDS there this week may bring the issue out in the open. 18 Nigeria's protesters want nothing short of a new Government. 4 Despite tough statements, Mexico's antidrug war is failing. 16 Colombia's President-Elect vowed to fight the drug cartels. 16 Warsaw businesses are demanding a crackdown on organized crime. 11 France's tradition of free expression counters a language law. 6 As Communism fades, a Vietnam hospital is struggling for aid. 19 The Haiti embargo makes the country's poor dependent on aid. 16 The United States warned Cuba not to allow a flood of refugees. 17 The Khmer Rouge promised to investigate an abduction. 18 An attack in Lebanon killed Israeli soldiers. 21 Spain is easing its military draft to encourage compliance. 12 National 22-34 MUTUAL FUND CONNECTIONS Some mutual fund managers are buying high-risk stocks of companies employing executives, advisers or underwriters with whom the managers have close connections. 1 HEALTH CARE'S FORGOTTEN AGENDA In the furor over universal coverage and employer mandates, the goal of controlling costs has receded from the political debate. 1 INQUIRY ON ETHICS AT AGRICULTURE Federal investigators have expanded their inquiries into possible ethical violations by Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and two of his aides. 1 A TIME-TESTED RESPONSE TO CRIME A California Assemblyman has introduced a bill allowing judges to punish young graffiti vandals by sentencing them to up to 10 whacks with a hardwood paddle. 22 A TRADITION REMAINS STRONG Long before television (and televangelists), the nation had evangelists who gathered people in fields and parks to hear an unvarnished Gospel and pleas for conversion. 22 IN THE WAKE OF THE HEARINGS In the pathology of scandal, Whitewater showed itself this week to be a fever; not fatal, but politically wasting and beyond a simple cure. 26 NEW PROSECUTOR SAYS LITTLE The newly appointed independent counsel on Whitewater promised to be fair and even-handed, but declined to discuss anything else about his plans for the investigation. 27 Metro 35-40, 52 SAFE STREETS, DIFFERENT ROUTE Four years after the Dinkins administration began a huge expansion of the police forces with the slogan, ""The beat cop is back,"" the hiring goals have been largely fulfilled, but the community policing strategy has been altered. 35 DRAWN BLINDS ON LONG ISLAND Business has plummeted near the site of the third attack by a sniper or snipers in 12 days in Suffolk County.

us,Business Diary: July 31 - August 5,"THE ECONOMY July Employment Numbers Add Up to Higher Rates Job growth is going up, up and away -- so that the inflation-fighting Fed is likely to act this month to raise interest rates a fifth time this year. President Clinton was quick to point out that more than four million new jobs -- the number he pledged to produce by the end of this year -- have been created since he took office. That's all well and good, but he can't take all the credit. Last spring, the economy proved it sometimes has a life of its own; before the Administration was able to present its ill-fated stimulus package to Congress, payrolls jumped in May. Labor Secretary Robert Reich warned then not to ""put too much weight on a single month's numbers."" Last week, he said figures for July are ""further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady course."" In July, the economy created 259,000 new jobs, about 60,000 more than consensus forecasts. Average hourly earnings rose by 4 cents, to $11.12. Japan Trade Is a Sticky Situation Talk about bad timing. The Clinton Administration has decided it's time to get tough with Japan on trade. Last week, it formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding some contracts. But the Administration is putting on the gloves amid such dizzying political turmoil in Japan that the Asian target's outline is fuzzy: Japan has had four Prime Ministers in a little more than a year. A former United States trade official said prodding a decision out of the ""collection of ministries"" was like ""punching a marshmallow."" In the process, experts say, the dollar could spill the most blood -- if the United States gets so frustrated it drives down the dollar's value to sell more goods in Japan. Paul Allen's Gizmo Search Some Lollapalooza goers are getting more than they bargained for this year. Besides jamming to their favorite alternative-rock bands and hanging loose in the summer heat, some will likely help determine what will be the next gadget or two appearing on store shelves everywhere. Last week, Paul Allen -- a software billionaire who cofounded Microsoft and owns Ticketmaster and part of Egghead Software -- flew to Providence, R.I., to check out his $3 million technology exhibition roaming the country with the music fest. His goal is to discover the next big hit in consumer electronics. Among the computerized offerings the concertgoers experienced was the ""Baby Maker"" software program, which lets a couple -- regardless of sex -- combine their images digitally to see what their offspring would look like. Clinton Wants R-E-S-P-E-C-T Dissatisfied with the little bit of commendation he's getting for the economy's performance, President Clinton last week held a news conference to sing his own praises. The White House also brought out backup vocals: eight top economic officials who touted their agencies' successes in the last 18 months. Commerce Secretary Brown harmonized: ""I don't think that the President has gotten the credit that he has deserved."" Dog Days of Retail The Gap made a little money in July. The Limited lost a little. But Sears and Woolworth lapped up gains. ""The trend in July is no trend,"" one retail analyst remarked. ""Sales are really all over the board."" Those erratic sales leave few clues about where sales are headed. The only thread of the retail story is that diversified retailers -- discounters and department stores -- are doing better than stores that simply sell clothing. Sometimes, much better. The merchandise group at Sears, Roebuck announced it sold more appliances the last week of July than in any other week in its history. COMPANIES Upjohn Pays its Probers Did too! Did not! Did too! Did not! Whatever happened, Upjohn last week agreed to pay $650,000 to several state investigative agencies. In New York, the Attorney General said Upjohn violated state laws against deceptive and misleading business practices when, from September 1992 to March 1993, it paid pharmacists $8 every time a patient they consulted switched from one diabetes drug (Micronase, which lost its patent protection two years ago) to another (Glynase, which is still protected). Upjohn said last week it did nothing wrong in its marketing plan but it would pay eight states -- Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- about $84,000 each for their investigative costs. Time Out at Nasdaq For 34 minutes one day last week, Nasdaq trading was interrupted after a squirrel chewed through a power line and the stock trading system's backup power system failed to kick in. The hapless squirrel can be forgiven. But can the nation's second-largest stock market? It has, after all, donned the garb of a technological leader and seduced leading high-tech companies -- Intel and Microsoft -- that look mighty alluring on its arm. And the outage was only one of three technological breakdowns at Nasdaq since July 14. Cyanamid Gets the Looks Not long ago, American Cyanamid's dance card was empty. (Earlier this decade, when the company's focus was on manufacturing chemicals, it was an outcast that watched its stock price slide for two dreadfully long years.) In came a new C.E.O., who in the last 18 months has transformed the concern into a health care and agricultural products company by cutting costs and shedding sorry divisions. The makeover worked. Last week, American Home Products presented American Cyanamid with a surprise, $8.5 billion cash takeover offer, causing the company's stock to soar more than 40 percent. Several more suitors may be lining up. Securities experts say European drug and chemical concerns like Bayer, Ciba-Geigy, Hoechst and Zenaca could offer even better propositions. MGM Puts Faith in Vegas How obsessed are Americans with gambling? Very, MGM and Primadonna Resorts suggested last week when they bet $300 million on yet another Vegas gambling center. (MGM itself just opened the nation's biggest casino resort there six months ago, at a cost of $1 billion.) The latest casino -- New York-New York -- is also one in a string of projects taking shape while Las Vegas luxuriates in a record summer. ""This is a sign of confidence in the Las Vegas market,"" said a University of Las Vegas professor, ""but this rush-ahead, rush-ahead philosophy is a gamble, and the fact that MGM cut someone else in indicates that they think it is something of a crap shoot, too."" What Now for Barry Diller? It's a done deal -- unless a more generous offer surfaces in the next month. Barry Diller's QVC, the home shopping channel, is set to be taken over by the cable television giants Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast. If a better bid does come along, QVC would pay TCI and Comcast a $55 million breakup fee. Otherwise, as agreed last week, the cable duo will snare QVC for $2.5 billion. Ever since Diller joined QVC as chairman about a year and a half ago, he has been seeking a partner. He also courted Home Shopping Network, Paramount Communications and CBS. The restless Diller is not expected to stay. INTERNATIONAL Out of (South) Africa, Still Jailed, he inspired song and sit-ins. The personification of how blacks were persecuted under apartheid in South Africa, he was the torch investor activists and students carried to light fires under American companies to divest themselves of operations there. But now that Nelson Mandela is free and leading his country, he can't get investors' attention. Last week -- 10 months after he formally invited foreign business to return -- a snapshot of investment activity since April showed more foreign money flowing out than in, despite the fact that advance scouts of Western dough last year promised investment if peace prevailed and Mandela embraced the free market. Now, potential investors complain about things like a costly labor force and trade barriers. China Market's Painful Start When the Chinese Communist Government held its reborn stock market by the feet and slapped its bottom to get it breathing in 1990, China was unprepared for the challenge -- and pains -- the market would bring once it started walking. While the market created quick fortunes for a handful of investors and hit record highs early last year, it wasn't long before it took a fall. Recent months brought a near collapse, and when many first-time Chinese investors panicked and sold off shares, they lost their life savings. Last week, however, the index for the Chinese-only A shares more than doubled. Some frustrated investors vowed to abandon the market and its vagaries. And others talked about ""winning"" back their losses.",1994-08-07T05:00:00+0000

For Peace and Love, Try Raving Till Dawn","WHAT Zippies (Zen-Inspired Pronoia Pagans), an improbable hybrid of old-school hippies, New Age travelers and ecstatic ravers from England who have been traveling the United States, holding parties to create what they call America's first true summer of love. Forget San Francisco in 1967 and all those pretty flowers in your hair; this time the oratory fuses peace, love and psychedelic drugs with the tools of today's counterculture: ""techno-trance"" music (the latest soundtrack for outdoor rave parties) and the anarchic cyberpunk mentality, which characterizes much of the communication on the Internet.THE PHILOSOPHY ""Pronoia,"" according to the Zippies' guiding spirit, Fraser Clark, 51, is the sneaking suspicion that others are conspiring behind your back to help you. The quintessential Zippy knows no age but knows how to rave -- that is, how to dance till dawn. Zippies aspire to combine the experience and ecological wisdom of the hippie with the youthful energy and idealism of the raver. Why? To tap into an innate tribal being, a state of mind the Zippies call ""techno-shamanism."" But Mr. Clark notes, ""We're not love gurus.""PLACE OF BIRTH The crossover between Britain's acid-house scene in the late 1980's and groups of nomadic hippies known as New Age travelers rekindled the Woodstock ideals of collective karma and frolicking in the countryside. With the opening last October of Megatripolis, a London club started by Mr. Clark -- complete with laser shows, virtual reality booths and psychedelic trance music -- the Zippies came into full being. At its opening the club turned away 3,000 people, and Mr. Clark became lord of the new techno-shamanarchy. ""I'm just a guy,"" he says, adding, ""Jesus was just a guy, too, of course.""ZIPPYDOM IN THE UNITED STATES Such ""cyberdelic"" celebrities as Timothy Leary, the Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow and the author Ken Kesey have already expressed support for the Clark gospel. Having held rave parties in New York and San Francisco and at this year's Rainbow gathering in Wyoming, the Zippies have scheduled a weeklong ""megarave"" at the World Unity Festival, a musical and spiritual gathering near the Grand Canyon, beginning Aug. 22.THE NAME These Zippies bear no relation to the political faction of hippies who called themselves Zippies (Zeitgeist International Party) after breaking with Abbie Hoffman's Yippies (Youth International Party) in 1972. Nor, for that matter, with the cult cartoon character Zippy the Pinhead.THE HYPE Put it down to pre-millennial fever or just the time of year, but the Zippies believe that the summer of '94 will inspire a countercultural renaissance. It is the 25th anniversary of three events that captured the consciousness of the 60's: Woodstock, the Stonewall uprising and the arrival of the first man on the moon, all of which have prompted nostalgia and expectancy. ""It's the 60's again,"" Mr. Clark said. ""It's a fractal of some kind, and each time it's more massive and eventually it breaks out of the old pattern. This has got to be the one, because we don't have time for the next fractal in another 25 years.""MARK JOLLY",1994-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, appeared to be negotiable. The group's proposals are expected to focus chiefly on questions of bureaucracy, cost controls and malpractice litigation. In the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington said there was no ""magic date"" for the House to take up health reform again, but added, ""I hope that's before Labor Day."" Democrats backing the House leadership's plan, which relies on employer contributions to provide universal insurance coverage, criticized the much more modest health bill put forward by 10 conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. They complained it would leave as many as 30 million Americans without insurance. WHITE HOUSE Cabinet members went in a group from the White House to Capitol Hill to lobby senators on the health bill. ""We're at a turning point both in the Administration and the country,"" said Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor.

Have You Hugged Your Rottweiler Today?","WHAT The Rottweiler, commonly referred to as a ""Rottie"" by canine enthusiasts. A purebred dog that borrows its name from the town of Rottweil in Germany. Distinguishing features: a short coarse black coat, docked tail, symmetrical rust markings and formidable size and strength (23 to 27 inches in height, weighing 90 to 110 pounds). Prices vary greatly -- from $250 to $1,500.A DOG'S LIFE The Rottweiler's ancestors can be traced back to the Roman Legion -- soldiers used the dogs to herd cattle while crossing the Alps. Left in Germany, the dogs thrived and became known as ""Rottweiler metzgerhund"" (""Rottweiler butcher's dog"") because they were used by butchers to pull carts loaded with meat. In recent years, Rotties have gone from guarding drug dealers to guarding Range Rovers. Today, the Rottweiler is the second most popular purebred in the United States.ROTTIES TRY HARDER ""The Rottweiler is the guard-dog-of-the-moment,"" said Wayne Cavanaugh, the vice president of communications for the American Kennel Club. ""But as popular as these dogs become, they never displace the number-one dog, which for the past few years has been the Labrador, the quintessential family dog. So you have the most friendly dog at the top, followed by a guard dog. That's some incredible yin and yang.""WOMEN WHO RUN WITH THE ROTTIES Owners have tended to be men. But recently, obedience schools have reported a marked increase in female owners. ""It's the ideal dog for a woman living alone in the city,"" said Clare Maloy, the proud owner of Honey, a six-year-old Rottweiler. ""Everybody gets out of my way when I walk down the sidewalk with Honey; it's like the parting of the Red Sea.""HOLLYWOOD MAKEOVER Move over, Rin Tin Tin and Lassie. Warner Brothers has purchased the movie rights to the popular children's book ""Good Dog, Carl"" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), whose eponymous hero is a lovable Rottweiler. This favorable depiction is a far cry from ""The Omen,"" the 1976 movie in which Rottweilers were portrayed as demonic beasts.ROTTIES VS. NEW YORKERS A dead heat. According to ""The Complete Dog Book"" (American Kennel Club), ""The Rottweiler is basically a calm, confident and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships. It is an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong willingness to work.""ROTTIE COUPLE Robin Stark and Jimmy Kranz pursue two Rottie-centric careers out of their California home. Mr. Kranz's company, Peticular Products, markets more than 100 Rottie-inspired items, like the Imported Rottweiler Necktie and the Rottweiler Nightlight. Ms. Stark is the editor of The Rottweiler Quarterly, a 350-page magazine referred to as the bible in Rottie circles.BEWARE OF DOG The Rottweiler is not the dog for everyone. Prospective owners should be knowledgeable about dogs and willing to walk them regularly. Obedience school is a prerequisite; unlike small dogs, the Rottweiler's bite is far worse than its bark.RENE CHUN",1994-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Dontgetinmyway, the 6-5 favorite with driver John Campbell, grabbed the lead in midstretch and stormed home to win by two lengths over Tattler's Torpedo in a time of 1:534/5 for the mile. Dontgetinmyway boosted his earnings to $438,625 with his fifth victory in eight starts on the season. The favorite returned $4.40, $2.40 and $2.40 with Tattler's Torpedo returning $3.60 and $3.20. Neutrality was third and paid $9.00. Efishnc won the $567,500 Sweetheart Pace for 2-year-old fillies, defeating the 3-5 favorite CR Daniella by 3 1/4 lengths in 1:543/5 .

Hard Times in Black and White","More than 55 years ago, Roy Stryker of the Farm Security Administration led a Government-sponsored photography project to create a comprehensive record of the lives of ordinary (meaning, for the most part, rural) Americans. He scattered his photographers throughout the land, and in the early 1940's he sent John Collier Jr., Jack Delano and Russell Lee to work in New Mexico. FAR FROM MAIN STREET. Three Photographers in Depression-Era New Mexico: Russell Lee, John Collier Jr., Jack Delano (Museum of New Mexico, paper, $22.50) provides a good introduction to these photographers, whose humanistic vision conjures up an era when artists still believed in the redemptive value of a slice of life. Jack Delano covered the railroads for a project to promote the industrial war effort, producing stark portraits of workers and surreal images of rail cars crossing the desert. Lee, responding to Stryker's request to find a ""town being born,"" focused on Pie Town, N.M., where he recorded community sings, farm folk and barrooms, faith in the basic goodness of man fairly shining through his black-and-white images. Collier, who had spent a lot of time in New Mexico and felt at home there, had access to the Spanish-speaking communities in the northern part of the state. His photographs of adobe buildings, religious artifacts and domestic scenes reflect his respect and appreciation for that culture. Although their mission was to provide data about daily lives, all three photographers also produced work of transcendent grace and beauty. The photographs are richly reproduced in ""Far From Main Street,"" but sometimes are too crowded on the page, and it is often harder than it should be to figure out whose photographs you're looking at.

The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court. Unitrin announced on Aug. 12 that it would expand an earlier repurchase plan by 10 million shares, or more than 19 percent of its common stock.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"TRACK AND FIELD Christie Wins and Torrance Pulls Upset Two days after outsprinting the best field assembled this year, in Zurich, Linford Christie of Britain won another 100-meter race yesterday, beating Dennis Mitchell of the United States at the Van Damme Memorial track meet in Brussels. But the winning streak of a Russian, Irina Privalova, in the women's 100 was ended by another American, Gwen Torrance. The 34-year-old Christie won in 10.03 seconds even though he was somewhat slow out of the blocks because of wet conditions. Torrance ran the second best women's time of the season, 10.83 seconds, in easily beating Merlene Ottey of Jamaica. Privalova, who beat Torrance in Zurich, was well back. The British hurdler Colin Jackson stayed on course for the pot of gold to be awarded to any athlete who can win his or her event in each of the Golden Four meets in Oslo, Zurich, Brussels and Berlin. The German meet will be held on Aug. 30. Jackson won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.22 seconds. (AP) GOLF Plus-14 Vaults Lowery Into Lead Showing little fear of sand and little regard for his better-known competitors, Steve Lowery carded seven birdies in a bogey-free round yesterday to take the lead at the halfway point of the International in Castle Rock, Colo. Lowery, whose best finish in seven seasons on the PGA Tour was a second at San Diego this year, earned 14 points and had a two-round total of 21 points under the modified Stableford system. Equaling Lowery's plus-14 as the day's best score was Dave Stockton Jr., who was at plus-20 along with Mike Reid. First-round leader Bruce Lietzke, dropped from 16 points to 14 under the scoring system in which a player receives 8 points for a double eagle, 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse. (AP) Putt Canceled on Account of Tornado Threat: Ellie Gibson didn't get a chance to attempt a 25-foot birdie putt for the lead on the final hole yesterday because lightning and the threat of a tornado forced the suspension of play at the L.P.G.A. Chicago Challenge. Gibson, who began the day a shot behind first-round leader Katie Peterson-Parker, was tied for the lead with six others at 7-under par when play was halted. She was among 11 players scheduled to complete the second round this morning. Peterson-Parker, who shot a 72, was tied with Kathryn Marshall, Janice Gibson, Michelle Estill, Dale Eggeling and Jane Geddes at 137. (AP) My Son, the Caddie: With his golf pro son, Tad, serving as his caddy, Dick Rhyan shot a 6-under-par 66 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the Burnet Senior Classic in Coon Rapids, Minn. ""Tad was on the (PGA) Tour last year but he lost his card. He's getting ready to go to tour qualifying school. He's been caddying for me for three weeks and we haven't been over par."" Rhyan said.

The group separately briefed both George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, and the Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. President Clinton has said he could not support a proposal that did not provide coverage for 95 percent of Americans by 2000. But as debate continued on the Senate floor, Republican senators, including Mr. Dole, continued to insist that lawmakers be allowed to go home and talk to the voters before making any decisions. WHITE HOUSE At a news conference, President Clinton urged Congress to continue trying to reach a compromise. ""I would say to them, 'Keep working, keep working at it, because if you delay, you may lose it altogether,' "" he said.

Decadent Daybeds","WHAT The daybed, a twin bed with a metal or wood frame on three sides, designed as double-duty furniture for use during waking and sleeping hours. Daybed styles have proliferated in the last several years and now encompass everything from white iron with painted porcelain finials to 18th-century wood sleigh-bed styles. Package prices (frame and mattress) are $200 to $1,200. Dan Greer, vice president of sales for the Fashion Bed Group, a Chicago-based manufacturer, estimates that daybed sales have doubled in the last five years. ""You not only have wood frames now; you have your contemporary, country and gothic wood,"" he said. ""We've just introduced a mahogany stain and a style with leather accents.""THE LACK-OF-SPACE AGE New Yorkers are space- and comfort-deprived, so daybeds are handy. ""People are buying them instead of sofa beds,"" said Don Kaplan, a salesman for Sleepy's mattress and bedding store in SoHo. ""They don't have the space to open up a sofa bed; plus, a daybed is more comfortable."" Sales are somewhat higher on the East Coast, particularly in the New York City area, Mr. Greer said. Daybeds do best in cities where space is at a premium.WHO'S IN THE MARKET? More women than men, but that's normal for furniture buying in general. Daybeds obviously appeal to studio dwellers and appear to cut across age groups.PRICE BREAK Daybeds were introduced as a ""nostalgic Victorian"" look in the early 1980's. Prices dropped from $700 for just the frame to the same price or lower for an entire package, Mr. Greer said. Styles also branched out around the same time, offering choices to those with more contemporary tastes.AN AMERICAN COUSIN The daybed is an American cousin of the chaise longue, the divan and the recamier. Like its exotic European relatives, it seems quietly to invite indolence and decadence. A stolen nap in the middle of the day, the invitation of an open bed in one's sitting room -- how sinful! This style is in contrast to the stark, sleek profile of the futon, the sofa-bed alternative of the 1980's. Futons are minimalist; daybeds are post-modern.BED LITE Very 1990's: practical and comfortable, but with style. ""It has that dual-function thing everyone's looking for these days,"" Mr. Greer said. Mr. Kaplan added that a daybed provides a ""lighter look""; despite being considerably heavier than many sofa beds, daybeds somehow look airy. THE OLD COLLEGE TRY But it's only a twin bed, and may take some getting used to. If you have a paramour, just think of it as romantically reminiscent of your college dorm days when your partner had to wrap around you to sleep in the same bed. If you really like your partner but are commitment shy or large of frame, you can get a trundle bed that slides out and up from underneath the main daybed -- a popular alternative, Mr. Kaplan said, for couples who ""need their own space.""MARLA MATZER",1994-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Or this: ""Of course, if the Combination"" -- the name the mob called itself in its early years -- ""had been running the country in the 30's instead of just feasting on it, Hitler would have been buried in his brown shirt the first time he showed up in a Berlin beer hall. And the Japanese warlords would have been whacked out by Murder Inc. before the new moon turned on the Rising Sun."" However, the photographs, ranging from one showing Dutch Schultz lying on a hospital gurney examining his fatal wounds to an image of the lifeless body of Abraham (Kid Twist) Reles spread out on a ledge five stories below the hotel window from which he fell (or more likely was pushed), are fascinating and sometimes chilling. And resist the temptation just to flip through ""Loyalty and Betrayal,"" looking only at the pictures -- you would miss the odd, unexplained datum that makes the book fun, like Schultz's final words: ""French Canadian bean soup. I want to pay. Let me leave them alone!"" CHARLES SALZBERG",1994-08-21T05:00:00+0000

The narrator, a cynical and sardonic woman, investigates the death of her 6-year-old neighbor, a neglected child to whom she felt inexplicably drawn. Last year our reviewer, Robert Nathan, called this Danish novel ""not only a splendid entertainment but also an odd and seductive meditation on the human condition."" THE BEST INTENTIONS By Ingmar Bergman. Translated by Joan Tate. Arcade, $11.95. This novel-cum-autobiography explores the marriage of the author's parents, a poor, straitlaced preacher and the overindulged daughter of a wealthy family. The book, which follows the outlines of Mr. Bergman's film of the same title, treats the couple's early years together, showing how love and resentment commingled. By examining their personalities in fiction, their son also finds clues to his own character. Last year our reviewer, Caryn James, said, ""A kinetic mix of screenplay, novel and memoir, 'The Best Intentions' is the closest thing imaginable to a Bergman film without pictures or sound.""",1994-08-21T05:00:00+0000

(Doubleday, $20.) A debut collection of sharp, smart short stories about people caught at the intersection between what they know they should do and what they can't help doing. THESE SAME LONG BONES, by Gwendolyn M. Parker. (Houghton Mifflin, $21.95.)

For instance, this summer the men's shirt is back, with shirttails flapping out over the trousers -- an idea that is not very new except for the attitude of those who are wearing it. Only last year, grunge dictated that the shirt should be worn with the sleeves tied around the waist. Now, the shirt is often wrinkled, a look that suggests anti-designer, but that doesn't mean it is not a studied style. It's the uniform worn by models on their way to work at the high-fashion designer men's wear shows (far left, far right and the three men at top). The look is being picked up by fashion followers, some of whom are adding diminutive vests.",1994-08-28T05:00:00+0000

It's easy to imagine a neighborhood -- the Lower West Side of Buffalo, for instance -- as though it were mainly a stockpile of buildings, an architectural shoreline of sorts. Into it flows a ""wave"" of people, marked by ethnic background or economic class. The wave leaves a high-water mark on the neighborhood and then it recedes, making room for another wave.

Every woman should be able to find something she likes, maybe even cannot live without. Some of these new notions are highly sophisticated. A lot are redolent of the glamour of eras past. Not a few are blindingly flashy. And several are frankly frivolous. It is possible, for instance, to mirror -- like the image on this page -- a dream of decades-past elegance.

The tobacco fields in Pitt County, N.C., among the country's most productive, are no longer paying farmers' bills because of a glut brought on by foreign competition. 1 WORRIES OF THEIR OWN Despite a week of public agonies over the dismissal of the N.A.A.C.P. director, the local branches of the civil rights group are just too busy to pay much attention. 24 SOME REST FOR THE WEARY After grappling with Cuba, the crime bill, health care and Whitewater, President Clinton and his family have started their vacation on Martha's Vineyard. 18 SCHOOL PRAYER DEBATE REIGNITED An Atlanta teacher's refusal to observe a new state law requiring a period of ""quiet reflection"" is a reminder that the debate over school prayer is not dead. 18 THE PRESERVING OF HISTORY The National Air and Space Museum plans to display the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, next year, but veterans groups say the display will be too forgiving of the Japanese. 25 FED OFFICIAL DISSENTS Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested keeping interest rates low to hold down unemployment. 26 An injunction against the building of a large telescope remained. 20 The ban on assault rifles got vocal reaction in a Virginia gun shop. 21 A study said a diet drug did not increase risk of brain damage. 28 Metro 31-36, 46 A CROSSING OF PATHS Desmond Robinson and Peter Del-Debbio come from different corners of the city's sprawling law-enforcement community. They might never have met, had it not been for a chilling misunderstanding. 1 MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SOLD Cablevision Systems and ITT emerged as the winners in the bidding for the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment properties, according to executives of the rival bidder, Liberty Media. 1 POLITICS AND INCUMBENCY It was billed by Governor Cuomo's office as a ground-breaking ceremony for a state-financed housing project. But it felt like an old-fashioned political rally, and that's one of the advantages of incumbency. 31 BLUE CROSS'S TROUBLES LINGER Even though Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has begun to repair its troubled finances, state and health care industry officials say the insurer is still on a dangerous slide. 31 A TRANSIT NAME CHANGE Would New York City's transit system by any other name still be the same confusing tangle of rail and bus lines in the eyes of riders?

In just two months, the new catechism of the Catholic Church, the first comprehensive statement of doctrine issued by the church in 400 years, has sold most of the 2.1 million copies now in print in the United States. Booksellers are routinely sold out of it and hope to sell another two million by Christmas if the printer can keep pace. WHO'S BUYING: Mostly Catholics, of course, but bookstores also report surprisingly strong sales to non-Catholics and even non-Christians curious about the teachings of one of the world's most widespread and most mysterious faiths. Church leaders last codified their beliefs in a catechism published in 1566. That document had a hard time keeping up with the 20th century. ""Whether they call themselves traditionalists or progressivists, everyone welcomes the fact that, doggone it, now at least we have one place where you can go and look it up,"" said the Rev.

us,Memory Tripping,"Many of the photographs in the opening pages of Elliott Landy's WOODSTOCK VISION: The Spirit of a Generation (Continuum, cloth, $39.50; paper, $19.95) illustrate the confrontational society that developed in the 1960's: police officers and demonstrators are depicted in a clash of nightsticks, blood and bared teeth. ""You could be the policeman or the demonstrator,"" Mr. Landy writes, ""but either way, you were still part of the fighting."" The violence shown in these shots contrasts with the spirit of the photographs of the 1969 Woodstock festival in the book's closing section. These two sections surround a stunning collection of photographs of the best-known rock stars of the 60's. Mr. Landy's images refract the inspiration he felt while documenting performances by Janis Joplin at the Newport Folk Festival and by Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix at the Fillmore East. ""If the 60's generation wanted to change the world, the musicians were viewed as the leaders,"" Mr. Landy writes. ""As artists they had discovered how to tap into the essence of the time, how to utilize masses of energy to move people and communicate their feelings."" Mr. Landy discusses at length his professional and personal relationship with Bob Dylan, particularly the sessions that resulted in the cover for the album ""Nashville Skyline,"" a photograph that he says ""perhaps . . . reflects the love we were all seeking to find through making the world a better place."" Mike Lang, one of the organizers of the Woodstock festival, asked Mr. Landy to photograph the event; the images of the peaceful, communal life Mr. Landy witnessed there stand in an interesting, though frustratingly brief, contrast to the violence shown in the book's opening paragraphs.

us,The Top 20,"The top 20 rankings were prepared by Malcolm Moran. The graduation percentage rate, from a National Collegiate Athletic Association report released this summer, includes scholarship athletes entering school from 1984 through 1987. The figure in parenthesis is the change from the 1993 N.C.A.A. report, which covered players entering from 1983 through 1986. 1. NEBRASKA: GRADUATION RATE47 (0) 1993 TIMES RANK5 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The narrow Orange Bowl loss to Florida State reaffirmed the conviction and imagination of Tom Osborne's program and demonstrated how close Nebraska is to the top. Quarterback Tommie Frazier has emerged as a complete player, and four returning starters in the offensive line provide continuity. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: Two new starters in the secondary, a game against U.C.L.A. on Sept. 17 and a path to the Orange Bowl that goes through Norman, Okla., on Nov. 25. 2. ARIZONA: GRADUATION RATE48 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Dan White and returning offensive linemen, including guard Warner Smith, could be in a better position to support a dominant defense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: If the Wildcats reach their first Rose Bowl, meeting a relatively low-ranked opponent could direct the attention of pollsters elsewhere. 3. FLORIDA: GRADUATION RATE 45 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 2 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A new 4-3-4 defensive approach should provide assistance for a maligned defensive backfield and strengthen a unit that returns 18 of 22 players. Terry Dean's strong finish last season made him the No. 1 quarterback. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK:: The new status as a preseason No. 1 has played mind-games elsewhere in the past. A recent history of road disappointments will become an issue when the Gators begin an imposing late-season challenge -- a grudge game at Florida State and a possible Southeastern Conference championship game within an eight-day period. 4. MAIMI: GRADUATION RATE 53 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 15 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Fiesta Bowl humiliation to Arizona, one very bad day without any incentive, made Hurricanes' decline seem worse than it was. Defensive end Rusty Medearis, who may start two years after a severe knee injury, will add an emotional boost. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: There may not be enough time to allow quarterback Frank Costa to reestablish his leadership. Games against Washington and Florida State could threaten what by then should be the longest home-field winning streak in college football. 5. FLORIDA STATE: GRADUATION RATE 40 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK 1 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A continuing collection of talent should compensate for the losses from a championship unit. But a No. 1-ranking has little margin for error, and the transition at several positions might require one. Sophomore tailback Warrick Dunn could one day hold a Heisman. Quarterback Danny Kanell, once a prized recruit, will take over the offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The fallout from the off-season scandal may be far from complete. What little dropoff between Charlie Ward as a finished product at quarterback and Kanell in the early stages could become the difference between a champion and challenger. 6. PENN STATE: GRADUATION RATE 72 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK 6 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Seven returning offensive starters will include tailback Ki-Jana Carter and quarterback Kerry Collins. Carter averaged 6.6 yards a carry, and Collins threw two interceptions in the last three games, including the Florida Citrus Bowl victory over Tennessee. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight new defensive starters and an unsettling reality that is new for Penn State but old for other Big Ten members: A New Year's trip to Pasadena must be preceded by a game at Michigan. 7. ALABAMA: GRADUATION RATE 40 (+5) 1993 TIMES RANK 23 REASONS TO BELIEVE: The Tide has lost just 2 of the 26 games Jay Barker has started as quarterback. In his senior year, Barker will have the help of the offensive coordinator Homer Smith, who has returned to Alabama. Six returning defensive starters include linebacker Michael Rogers, safety Sam Shade and cornerback Tommy Johnson. Punter Bryne Diehl and place-kicker Michael Proctor give the Tide outstanding special-teams play. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Jon Stevenson is the only returning starter in the offensive line. But another soft non-conference schedule should delay any serious challenge until the Tide travels to Knoxville on the third Saturday in October. 8. NOTRE DAME: GRADUATION RATE 82 (-3) 1993 TIMES RANK 4 REASONS TO BELIEVE: This should be the season for tailback Lee Becton to become appreciated as the player he has already become. A relatively simple early schedule could leave the Irish 8-0 going into the Florida State game at Orlando. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A defense with four returning starters, including outstanding free safety Bobby Taylor, will have just one of the top six tacklers from a year ago. The attention inspired by Ron Powlus, the gifted first-year quarterback, conceals a potentially dangerous problem: Notre Dame does not have a quarterback who has taken a snap in a game. 9. MICHIGAN: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 13 (tie) REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tyrone Wheatley's power and reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Tyrone Wheatley's separated right shoulder. 10. WISCONSIN: GRADUATION RATE 71 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 11 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Tailbacks Brent Moss and Terrell Fletcher combined for over 2,400 yards in 1993. Quarterback Darrell Bevell leads an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Eight days that should help determine the Big Ten race: Oct. 29 at Michigan, Nov. 5 at Ohio State. 11. COLORADO: GRADUATION RATE 55 (-5) 1993 TIMES RANK 17 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Nine returning offensive starters include the entire interior line. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The defensive secondary, a major problem last year, will be tested in non-conference games against Wisconsin, Michigan and Texas. 12. AUBURN: GRADUATION RATE 35 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 3 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A soft early schedule, with non-league games against Northeast Louisiana and East Tennessee State, should help ease the transition for offense. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The surprise factor is gone following last year's undefeated season, and N.C.A.A. probation remains. 13. VIRGINIA TECH: GRADUATION RATE42 (+6) 1993 TIMES RANK18 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Maurice DeShazo, who directed an option offense last year, threw for 2,080 yards and finished fifth in the nation in passing efficiency. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Two starters in a readjusted offensive line must advance quickly. 14. OKLAHOMA: GRADUATION RATE 48 (+3) 1993 TIMES RANK 12 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running back James Allen leads eight returning offensive starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Quarterback Garrick McGee, a junior-college transfer once at Arizona State, leads team that opens at Syracuse and Texas A&M. 15. TENNESSEE: GRADUATION RATE 46 (-1) 1993 TIMES RANK8 REASONS TO BELIEVE: A deep offensive line, led by guard Jeff Smith, should help quarterback Jerry Colquitt in his first season as a starter. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Opener at U.C.L.A. and Sept. 17 game against Florida. 16. U.C.L.A.: GRADUATION RATE 60 (+4) 1993 TIMES RANK 19 REASONS TO BELIEVE: J. J. Stokes is considered the best receiver in the nation. Quarterback Wayne Cook provides reliability. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: With early games against Tennessee and Nebraska, the work of a rebuilt offensive line will become essential. 17. NORTH CAROLINA: GRADUATION RATE 68 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 25 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Jason Stanicek threw for 1,874 yards in 1993. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: The offensive line has one returning starter -- center Pat Conneely. 18. SOUTHERN CAL: GRADUATION RATE 52 (+1) 1993 TIMES RANK 21 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Rob Johnson, who completed 68.6 percent of his passes last season, could introduce a quarterback to the quartet of Heisman-winning runners within Heritage Hall. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: Only four returning defensive starters and opening games against Washington and Penn State. 19. TEXAS: GRADUATION RATE 44 (+9) 1993 TIMES RANK31 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Quarterback Shea Morenz will lead an offense with nine returning starters. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: A rushing game must develop for the Longhorns to achieve offensive balance in John Mackovic's third year as head coach. 20. TEXAS A&M: GRADUATION RATE 37 (+2) 1993 TIMES RANK 9 REASONS TO BELIEVE: Running backs Rodney Thomas and Leeland McElroy will give the Aggies a chance to extend S.W.C. record of 22 consecutive league victories. POTENTIAL ROADBLOCK: If streak ends, being on probation may remove late-season incentive.",1994-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Or, if you prefer, for fable -- a charmingly loose-jointed one, of necessarily uncertain moral, with a big-city name, ""Mr. Vertigo."" Master Yehudi takes Walt to an isolated farmhouse in Kansas -- a land as strange as Oz to Walt -- where Walt is taught to float in the air while a black boy called Aesop has his prodigious mind educated so, Yehudi says (without apparent irony on anyone's part, even Paul Auster's), he might become ""a shining example to all the downtrodden black folks of this violent, hypocritical country.""

The ruling gave the victory to Britain's Damon Hill. Race stewards ruled that a mandatory wooden plank under Schumacher's car, recently required by Formula One and aimed at slowing down drivers, did not meet legal measurement requirements. It was either too thin or too light, giving him an advantage over his competitors. The incident is the third this year to jeopardize Schumacher's dominance, which once seemed vulnerable only to the guardians of Formula One racing. Schumacher, who could have won his eighth title, is already driving under an appeal of a two-race suspension for disregarding a black flag at the British Grand Prix. The German so dominated Sunday's race that even a sloppy spin in the 18th lap failed to allow the competition within striking distance. He finished 13.663 seconds ahead of Hill, his closest challenger in the title chase. The spin could have shaved some wood off the board, which is 30 centimeters wide, one centimeter thick and runs the length of the car. The car is allowed to lose only one millimeter during the race, but the ruling report said up to 2.6 millimeters were missing. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD Drummond Stuns Christie in 100 Meters Jon Drummond upset Linford Christie, the Olympic and world champion, in the 100-meter dash yesterday at the Rieti Invitational in Italy. Drummond's meet-record time of 9.99 seconds matched his personal best and easily outpaced Christie, who finished in 10.06. The world record-holder, Colin Jackson of Britain, pulled away with two barriers left to win the 110-meter hurdles in 13.07 seconds. Americans Alan Johnson and Anthony Dees were second and third, respectively. (AP) Sprinter Stripped of Medal: Horace Dove-Edwin, the Sierra Leone sprinter whose stunning second-place finish in the 100 meters was one of the biggest surprises of the Commonwealth Games, has tested positive for anabolic steroids. Dove-Edwin has been stripped of his silver medal and banned from the games, the Commonwealth Games Federation said yesterday.

Dawes, 17, beat the two-time world champion Shannon Miller at every turn.
