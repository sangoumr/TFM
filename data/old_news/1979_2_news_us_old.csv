us,"Screen: 'Train Robbery' Steams In on New Run:25,000 Caper","""THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY,"" adapted by Michael Crichton from his own best-selling novel and directed by him with great good humor, is based on the true story of what is alleged to have been the first train robbery in history. In 1855, a small band of extremely ingenious crooks made off with 25,000 in gold bars from the train carrying them from London to Folk-stone where, the authorities hoped, it would successfully be trans-shipped to the Crimea, there to pay the troops then fighting the Czar.Mr. Crichton's previous films as a director  ""Westworld"" and ""Coma""  are skillful and, each in its own way, entertaining, but they give no hint of the amplitude he displays in this visually dazzling period piece. With Sean Connery as the gang's elegant leader, the sort of mastermind who denies his body nothing, Lesley-Anne Down as his magnificent moll, and Donald Sutherland as his locksmith ""the best screwsman in England""  ""The Great Train Robbery"" is classy entertainment of the sort I associate exclusively with movies.The film, which opens today at the Criterion, Sutton and 86th Street East Theaters, has been written, directed and acted with intelligence, and it evokes its Victorian era with a completeness of detail that should satisfy the most finicky imagination.Mr. Crichton's screenplay displays what in an earlier time might have been called a saucy wit. The major portion of the film is devoted to the adventures of Mr. Connery and his associates as they seek the four keys necessary to unlock the safes containing the gold once they get aboard the train  this being in the days before nitroglycerin or combination locks.There is a prissy plain-Jane  very sweetly played by Gabrielle Lloyd  to be romanced by Mr. Connery, a prison escape to be arranged for the one catburglar in England who can pull off one phase crucial to the operation, and a con game to be played with a gullible bank manager in a brothel.The brilliant Alan Webb appears briefly but importantly as the elderly president of a bank, the possessor of one of the all-important keys. It is Mr. Webb who has one of the film's nicest lines when, explaining why his beloved dog lost a rat-baiting contest, he says with sadness, ""He lacked bustle."" Bustle is what this film is full of.Mr. Connery has both the humor and the dead-earnestness of purpose that are the method of the movie, which is to charm us as it keeps us on the edges of our seats. Mr. Sutherland, as the none-too-bright locksmith, and Miss Down, who must appear in several figuratively transparent disguises, have fun with what are, in effect, character roles. The three work together beautifully.As important as the contributions of the writer-director and the performers are those of Maurice Carter, the production designer, and the late Geoffrey Unsworth, director of photography. ""The Great Train Robbery"" gives us a panoramic view of early Victorian London, from its drawing rooms and luxurious private clubs to its gambling dens, its slums and its prisons. Its streets are alive with the kind of movement that only movies can afford. I've no idea what the picture cost, but it looks as if it must have been a mint.Additionally, the climactic heist of the gold, with Mr. Connery climbing atop the moving railroad cars, ducking under bridges just before a possible decapitation, is marvelous action footage that manages to be very funny as it takes your breath away.""The Great Train Robbery,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some rude language of our period, some double-entendres of no great subtlety and a very little partial nudity.",1979-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Property,' at American Mavericks Film Festival","Penny Allen's ""Property,"" which begins a three-day run today at the Entermedia Theater's American Mavericks Festival of independent films, is a folksy sort of movie, though the people in it are not types usually thought of as folksy, being random leftovers from the radicalism of the 1960's. They include a mid-30'ish male poet; a dwarf named Corky, who dreams of being a stand-up comedian on national television but who is appreciated only by his pals; a mild-mannered, silver-haired ex-con who lives with a younger woman  who hustles for money when necessary  and their small child, and various other people who seem less eccentric than emotionally undermotivated.What brings them together in this movie is a communal effort to purchase the block of rundown but substantial old houses in which they all live in Portland, Ore., after the owner decides to sell the property. The movie, written and directed by Miss Allen, is said to be based on actual events, with some of the original participants playing themselves. What we in the audience see is a movie without much pace or drive; rather it's a fond improvisation, competently photographed and adequately mimed. Experiencing it is like thumbing through somebody else's photograph album. The pictures are clear but the important associations are missing.""Property"" doesn't really dramatize the reconstructed events. It visits them after careful preparation, dropping in on block meetings, listening for a while, then moving on, once to a most tentative orgy whose three players look as if they're trying to remember what they're supposed to do. The block committee argues; members resign and return. Two people are appointed to visit the banks and various city commissions. For a while, the success of the endeavor is in doubt, but then, miraculously, all ends happily.I suspect, however, that the group's success in putting its hands on the necessary money and in establishing bank credit says less about the conscience of American capitalists than about the value of having solid, prosperous, middle-class parents if one wants to drop into the 70's after having dropped out of the 60's.""Property"" is a very, very loose movie, the kind that is best appreciated by friends and relatives of those who appear in it.",1979-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Dark Star,' Space Film Send-up","John Carpenter, the director of ""Halloween,"" made ""Dark Star"" in 1974, when ""Star Wars"" was barely a subatomic particle in George Lucas's eye. Accordingly, Mr. Carpenter's space-movie send-up toys with the conventions of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" instead of trying to simulate intergalactic whizzing.Four astronauts have spent 20 years together on the spaceship for which the movie is named, and, with only the obligatory sexy-voiced computer to keep them company, they're bored. So they daydream about surfing, or sit at control panels that look like back-lit Scrabble boards, or play practical jokes that aren't often good for a laugh. Much of the movie takes place in the cinematic equivalent of zero gravity, just floating around. Even in the glow of hindsight, ""Dark Star"" doesn't contain many indications that Mr. Carpenter is a director about to turn the world on its ear.There are some funny routines here, though Mr. Carpenter doesn't seem to have cared much about integrating or sustaining them. At the finale, a bomb is timed to explode in a matter of minutes if one of the astronauts can't give it a brief lesson (the bomb is intelligent, or at least it talks) in phenomenology. The spaceship's mascot, also inexplicably alive, is a tomato-colored beach ball with little clawed feet. The opening credits are set to a country and western song about space travel, incongruous at the very least. One of the astronauts' silver-colored suits has a front panel that looks suspiciously like a muffin tin.""Dark Star,"" which will be shown tomorrow through Monday at the Entermedia Theater as part of the American Mavericks series there, is a very low-budget undertaking. Although ""Hardware Wars,"" a hilarious 13-minute sci-fi parody that played at the Film Forum several months ago, is clear evidence that an inexpensive film need not lack for panache, Mr. Carpenter makes his amateurishness unmistakable, especially when it comes to the film's four actors. Only one of them can act even crudely (fortunately, his is the largest role). The other three, neither photogenic nor particularly extroverted, look like well-meaning fraternity brothers helping out a pal with his class project.",1979-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The occasion for exploring the subject is a 40-year reunion of the strikers, all of whom were men. The director, Lorraine Gray, worked with other members of the Women's Labor History Film Project to combine vintage footage of the strike with new interview material.To the tune of ""Union Maid,"" the women recall what working conditions were like  and how much better they could be ""if you were the kind of girl who would let the boss pat you."" They talk of how unwelcome their participation was when the strike first began, and how they eventually began cooking for the strikers and equipping their children with placards  ""My Daddy Strikes for Us Little Tykes."" The presentation of this material is a little dull, and a lot like that of other labor movement chronicles, but informative on the whole.???ABC-TV Plans 3 Hours For Hearst-Case drama???ABC-TV has scheduled a three-hour made-for-television dramatization of the kidnapping and search for Patricia Hearst, the heiress who was released from prison last week after receiving a Presidential commutation of sentence. The program is to be presented on March 4.According to the network, the movie, entitled ""Get Patty Hearst,"" has been in development for two years.The screenplay, by Adrian Spies, is based on the recollections of Charles Bates, the former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who was in charge of the investigation of the kidnapping. Dennis Weaver will portray Mr. Bates, and the role of Miss Hearst will be played by Lisa Eilbacher.""In the Best Interests of the Children,"" another documentary, is about lesbian mothers with sole custody of their children. It asks whether this can be a satisfactory arrangement for all concerned, and answers with a resounding ""Yes!"" before you've even heard the question.A couple of experts are interviewed, including a lawyer who explains that fathers who sue their lesbian wives for custody of the children often return the children once they've won in court. This point is not elaborated any further. None of the fathers is interviewed, and the children are asked only general questions, to which they give answers that are more affirmative than they are thoughtful or revealing. ""Lesbians are people  I mean, so what, they're lesbians,"" one daughter explains."" There is also a lot of footage of mothers and children playing or talking in the sunlight. The most memorable of these scenes shows a mother and son engaged in conversation while they feed the family duck, and it's fascinating. Honestly. Have you ever seen a duck eat?Why are these two films on the same bill at the Public Theater? The only common ground they share is that they're both about women and that each is earnest but a little slow.

us,Film: 'In Praise of Older Women' Arrives Breathily:Loutish Lover,"""IN Praise of Older Women"" details the adventures of Andras Vayda, a Hungarian writer, as he grows from dirty young boy to dirty old man. The movie follows Andras from an early, clumsy encounter with a middle-aged countess, whom he tackles and almost knocks over, to his latter-day sexual frolicking with a Canadian housewife, who is more of an enthusiast than an acrobat and hence almost breaks his neck. ""In Praise of Older Women"" isn't supposed to be a comedy, but its sex scenes are so close to slapstick that they're funnier than the screenplay, which is full of howlers.Teen-age coquette, rebuffing Andras's pass while dressed in a see-through negligee, which she says is a gift from her dad: ""Hey . . . I just wanted to show you my new nightie!"" Older Woman No. 1, finding Andras on her doorstep in the middle of the night: ""Well, come on in. I've been sleeping too much anyway."" Andras, delivering his second best come-on: ""I decided to throw myself in the Danube if I didn't ask you to make love with me tonight."" Andras's very best come-on: ""Come with me to the Casbah, ha ha.""As Andras, Tom Berenger has a handsome, bony face and an idiotic petulance that suggests he may hold his breath till he turns blue if he doesn't get his way with the ladies. Nevertheless, he wins the hearts and loosely clad torsos of Karen Black, Susan Strasberg. Alexandra Stewart and several other actresses who should have stayed in bed, or out of bed, or in any case out of the way of George Kaczender, the director. Only Miss Stewart adds a soupon of class to the proceedings.The story, from a novel by Stephen Vizinczey, must surely read better than it plays. It would be hard and senseless work for an author to make his hero as loutish as Mr. Berenger is when, seeing a man collapse in a drunken stupor at a party, he turns to the man's wife and observes, ""I guess that leaves you free for the rest of the evening.""Mr. Kaczender directs talky scenes a tiny bit better than he directs scenes of amour, which is too bad, since amour is everything in a movie with nothing else going on. (To be fair, the Hungarian revolt of 1956 is mentioned several times, but it hardly interferes with Andras's activities on the home front.) The sex scenes, which are uniformly uncomfortable and soft-core, have either been shortened after the film's completion or deliberately edited with a shiv. The film opens today at the RKO Cinerama and other theaters.",1979-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Some people thought she had committed sucide  when last seen, she was said to be distraught. Other people suspected she'd been murdered. There were those who suspected a hoax. All theories were given prominent play by the press. When, 11 days later, Mrs. Christie was found, alive and well, in the English resort town of Harrowgate, registered under the last name of her husband's secretary, she would give no explanations. Her husband, Col. Archie Christie, suggested somewhat ingenuously that she'd had amnesia.That was that  almost. Two years later, the Christies were divorced, and the colonel married his secretary. Four years after that, Mrs. Christie married Max Edgar Mallowan, the archeologist, and lived, we can assume, successfully ever after until her death in 1976.""Agatha,"" which opens today at the Cinema 1, stars the surprising and beautiful Vanessa Redgrave as Mrs. Christie and a comically inventive Dustin Hoffman as a fictitious American newspaper columnist named Wally Stanton, a Lucius Beebe sort of dandy-journalist, who uncovers the real story.The real story? Well, it's the story that Kathleen Tynan, who had the idea for this film and wrote the screenplay with Arthur Hopcraft, has imagined, given the few verifiable facts of the case. The result is a handsome, rudder-less sort of movie that isn't quite a mystery story, not quite a love story and certainly not a biography. ""Agatha,"" like most speculation on minor matters, would be immediately forgettable if it weren't for the resourcefulness of the two stars.As Mrs. Tynan and Mr. Hopcraft tell it, Agatha and Archie Christie (Timothy Dalton) are living a lie. Archie, bored with being known as Agatha's husband, and bored with Agatha, has taken up with his secretary, Nancy Neele (Celia Gregory), whom he wants to marry. This news so unhinges Agatha that she hatches a diabolical plan that (not to give the plot away) will kill two birds with one stone. When Nancy goes to Harrowgate to take the waters and lose a little weight, Agatha follows, staying at a nearby hotel and waiting her chance for a most particular revenge.It's the revelation of ""Agatha"" that Mrs. Christie's trail is picked up by the American journalist, who also goes to Harrowgate, suspecting that something not very nice is about to happen. While trying to sort it out, Wally Stanton falls in love with Agatha. Since we know that Mrs. Christie never did marry anyone named Wally Stanton, the outcome of this nonaffair tends to leave us slumped back far from the edges of our seats. The only mysteries in the film are what Agatha has up her sleeve, and the manner in which it will go wrong.Agatha's plan is really quite ingenious, but it's a very small portion of the (by Michael Apted), still seems unfinished. Miss Redgrave's performance as an abandoned wife in the early scenes is so vivid and honest that the narrative that follows hardly does justice to the character. Mr. Hoffman finds a good deal of humor in a role he appears to have made up  his mannerisms, anyway  though you never for a moment believe he could have fallen in love with such a desperate character.It's not the acting that's at fault Agatha and Wally have several quietly funny and serious moments together, including one when, after Wally has coached her to a brilliant success in a game of billiards, he asks her for a lance in the hotel dining room. They walk onto the floor and begin to fox trot, he holding her as if she were an elf, while she is so taken by him, she doesn't appear to notice that she towers above him. This may well be a movie breakthrough  the first time that a leading man has been so dwarfed by his leading lady without damage to either reputation.The period details are lovely enough, but the movie makes nothing of them. It is dcor that at best reminds us of the fun we had watching ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""Death on the Nile."" I have no idea whatever what Mr. Apted's contributions were. He seems to favor tight close-ups, but so do a lot of other directors. Vittorio Storaro, the man who photographed Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""1900,"" among other things, pulls off some tricky lighting effects that look just like tricky lighting effects.""Agatha"" is not a mess, but it's not much of anything. It's pleasantly endurable and aimless.""Agatha,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains nothing that could obviously give offense to the young.",1979-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Altman Offers Apocalyptic Fantasy:End Game,"ROBERT ALTMAN'S ""Quintet,"" which opens today at the Embassy, Beekman and Paramount Theaters, is, I suspect, exactly the movie that this very talented, wildly erratic director wanted to make  an apocalyptic fantasy about the end of the world, set in a new ice age that will follow the last great war when the earth has been thrown off its axis.The landscape is snow-covered, frozen. Almost all wild-life has vanished. Women, like the landscape, are barren. They no longer conceive. Packs of dogs gnaw on the bodies of those who have died of cold and malnutrition. No one pays much attention.The main pasttime in this lost world is a game called quintet, which is played with five players and looks sort of like a primitive backgammon, though it also involves its players in bouts of hide-and-seek in which one player must murder another. Although we're never told the rules of the game, it appears to be no more complicated than Old Maid played with death penalties.The city where the survivors live and play looks as if it might once have been Kennedy Airport, before the big blast. One particular apartment block suggests the Trans World Airlines terminal reduced to its principal structural components. The walls have collapsed. Stairways are escalators that no longer move.As you might suspect, ""Quintet"" is an art director's field day, though the sets sometimes make even less sense than the screenplay. The casino where citizens come to play quintet is part Alaskan cave, part Museum of Modern Art, photography gallery, the walls hung with large photo murals of the depressed and dispossessed of an earlier (our) era. Because we can make anything of this we want, the movie functions mostly as an animated Rorschach test.At its least boring, ""Quintet"" has a dream-like quality that is very soothing even when the movie means to be stern and scarifying, if only because nothing seems to be very important. Like its characters, ""Quintet"" is passionless, to such a degree that when one person stalks another with murder in mind, there is absolutely no suspense. Such total apathy is not easily attained without the help of chemicals.At its worst, which is most of the time, ""Quintet"" discovers a lot of small ideas that sound as if they'd been borrowed from ""Tomorrow,"" the shrilly dreadful song from ""Annie"" that reveals there's always another day.Some excellent actors move through the movie looking chilled to the bone, like guests at the end of a costume ball when the heat has been turned off. They include Paul Newman, a Life-Force character who refuses to be defeated by the game of quintet; Fernando Rey, the grand adjudicator who supervises the games and seems to have come to the party dressed as Christopher Colombus; Vittorio Gassman, who plays a character named St. Christopher but looks like Marco Polo; Bibi Andersson, a woman named Ambrosia who says such things as ""Death is always arbitrary. At least, that's been the principal complaint,"" and Nina Van Pallandt, a quintet player who appears to have lost her luggage while touring the North Pole. Brigitte Fossey appears briefly as what some writers might call a child-woman, meaning in this case that she sucks her thumb as she drifts into sleep.All great directors must be arrogant to the extent that they will follow their dreams through to the bitter, sometimes banal end. This time Mr. Altman's faith in himself has led him over the brink he was skirting in ""Three Women."" It's not a movie for his admirers but for members of his entourage.",1979-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: George C. Scott Stars in Nighttime World of 'Hardcore':Pilgrim's Descent,"""YOU like showing me this, don't you?"" snarls Jake VanDorn, the hero of Paul Schrader's brave and chilling ""Hardcore."" ""I hate it,"" replies the private eye Andy Mast, with conviction. VanDorn is a stern Midwestern businessman, whose teen-age daughter has disappeared, and Mast has been hired to find her. All he's found so far is an 8-millimeter peep-show movie featuring VanDorn's daughter and two men. There's cause to wonder why he's forcing VanDorn to watch this abomination.Yes, the early sequence in which VanDorn looks at only a few seconds' worth of film and then goes to pieces, makes for one of the most powerful moments in an already electrifying movie. But are there broader, less sensational reasons for ""Hardcore"" to include the episode? There are. Mast, played beautifully by Peter Boyle, may be something of a sadist, but he also senses VanDorn's crippling inability to look at whatever he doesn't choose to see. Mast is doing more than inflicting pain: He's helping VanDorn begin a journey that may provide him with a brutal  but perhaps necessary  education.VanDorn's shock isn't wholly centered on his daughter, any more than ""Hardcore,"" which opens today at the Loews State II, RKO 86th Street and Trans-Lux East theaters, is wholly about pornography. This is the anguish of someone who's devoted all his energies to controlling and limiting experience, only to fear that his efforts have cost him his resiliency and also been in vain. This is the grief of a devout man, a Calvinist, whose religious conviction has begun to look like smugness and may no longer afford him comfort. As he walks past the porno parlors of Los Angeles in search of his daughter, everything conspires to humiliate someone who has formerly been unassailable.An early scene of VanDorn at work, one of Mr. Schrader's most compact, establishes that his interest in women is at best guarded (he asks a pretty employee if she still has her boyfriend, she answers that she does, and he counters with a crisp, ""Nice fella, you don't want to lose him""); it also shows that he's habitually in control of situations even when he pretends not to be, and that he hates bright colors. A later, oddly parallel confrontation with an insolent employee in a lurid bookstore shows that for VanDorn, losing command may be the worst affront of all.The role of VanDorn is played by George C. Scott, but Mr. Schrader has written it as a part for John Wayne. There's a lot of ""The Searchers"" in the story of this strict, cruel, self-denying man, trying to find a woman who's fallen into odious circumstances and refusing to acknowledge the things he sees along the way. Mast often calls VanDorn ""Pilgrim,"" a nickname as reminiscent of Wayne as it is suggestive of VanDorn's religious zeal. But the insistence upon a John Wayne toughness eventually becomes the movie's undoing, even if the character retains his grit and his principles to the very end. The story line leads VanDorn to the breaking point, but Mr. Schrader won't let him even bend.Mr. Schrader's insistence that VanDorn can search for his daughter, in bars and brothels up and down the California coast, for a period of months without being changed by the ordeal is dramatic suicide: The ending of the movie is disastrously unrewarding and dishonest in several ways. Mr. Schrader can't get the surprise he wants by playing fair with the audience, so he makes the beginning of the film deliberatly misleading.By the time VanDorn teams up with a pretty young prostitute (played energetically by Season Hubley) who's desperate for his affection or anyone else's, Mr. Schrader has backed so far into a corner that he must choose between making VanDorn a cad or a sentimental sap; simple kindness has no place in the film's scheme. Neither does sex, despite the seamy milieu. Mr. Schrader, having paved the way for a story about a man who is forced to consider his own sexuality after being confronted by his daughter's, can't bring himself to explore this idea. There's a quick, funny and highly implausible subplot about VanDorn's posing as a porn film maker to find the men who acted with his daughter. But if a fiercely repressed character like VanDorn were to make a film revolving around sex, it might be just as perversely provocative, and yet as unyielding, as ""Hardcore.""Mr. Schrader, who also wrote ""Taxi Driver,"" has assembled enough ingredients of that film (including the superb cinematographer Michael Chapman) to make one mindful of what's missing this time. Once again, the action erupts into a violent and bloody conclusion, but the explosion makes less sense because the character is so incomplete. The sexuality of Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" was mysterious, too, but it was accounted for and linked inextricably with violence  if only in Robert De Niro's tiny gestures, as when, while watching television, he casually styles his thumb and forefinger like a gun, points it at the screen and pulls the trigger.And unlike ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Hardcore"" never gives in to the rhythm of its nighttime world, never swoons; Mr. Schrader doesn't seem capable of the perversely rhapsodic style his subject demands. But he does work with speed and intelligence, paying sharp attention to detail and making the movie as funny as it is quick and frightening.",1979-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Murder by Decree' in Foggy Old London:Ripper Redux,"NIGHT. Fog. A dingy alley in London's East End. A woman wearing a ratty boa, the symbol of her profession, flees into the darkness followed by a hard-breathing camera. The woman turns, looks pleadingly at us, suddenly screams in terror  and we're back in familiar Jack-the-Ripper land, which is the territory explored yet again in ""Murder by Decree,"" the new English film that opens today at the Ziegfeld Theater.The film, directed by Bob Clark, based on an original screenplay by John Hopkins, makes use not only of the theory that Jack the Ripper was actually the Duke of Clarence, son of Queen Victoria, but also of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who are apparently in the public domain, or at least available for assignments outside the works of Arthur Conan Doyle.With Christopher Plummer as a charming, cultivated Holmes, a fellow who reveals himself to be a man of unexpected social and political conscience, and with James Mason as an especially fond and steadfast Watson, ""Murder by Decree"" is a good deal of uncomplicated fun, not in a class with Nicholas Meyer's ""The Seven Percent Solution,"" but certainly miles ahead of many other current movies that masquerade as popular entertainment.Mr. Hopkins's screenplay is funny without being condescending, more aware of history, perhaps, than Conan Doyle's mysteries ever were, but always appreciative of the strengths of the original characters and of the etiquette observed in the course of every hunt. It's one of the nicer touches, I think, that the interest of Holmes and Watson is first drawn to the Ripper murders by the very fact that Scotland Yard, though baffled by the case, has not sought their help. Clearly something unusual is a foot.The something unusual involves a secret brotherhood of Freemasons, a possibly unwed mother (the script seems to equivocate on the woman's marital status), a famous psychic (played by Donald Sutherland in makeup that gives him the appearance of death), enough saucy London tarts to staff Piccadilly Circus for a month, as well as a conspiracy reaching  as they say in the movie  possibly to the throne itself. If you're someone who shares Watson's feelings about the monarchy, the suspicion of such wrong-doing is shattering.It is, of course, Holmes who gets to the bottom of the mess, meeting along the way some of England's best character actors, including John Gielgud as Lord Salisbury, the Prime Minister, and Anthony Quayle as a Scotland Yard commissioner, as well as Genevieve Bujold as a sweet woman wronged for security purposes. It is, however, Watson in the person of Mr. Mason who captures our affections and gives the movie character it would otherwise lack.Mr. Mason's Watson is a splendidly staunch and reliable friend, as well as loyal subject to Her Majesty, a dignified man capable of sacrificing his dignity, as when he must hobnob with hookers to obtain information, and utterly at the mercy of his idiosyncracies. In one of the funnier moments of the movie he solemnly explains to Holmes why he is trying to spear the last pea on his plate with a fork, instead of mashing it. ""I like the pea whole,"" he says, ""so it pops when I bite down on it.""The ultimate resolution of the mystery is no more or less convincing than those of dozens of other Holmes cases you've probably enjoyed, though this one makes some slight attempt to draw analogies to Watergate. However, the resolution to any Holmes case has never been as important as the chase itself, and when the chase is as entertaining as this one, there's not much point in looking back.""Murder by Decree,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), indicates that women who walk the streets are not always selling vegetables. The violence is handled with a fair amount of discretion.",1979-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: 'Warriors' Creates Visual Style That Is Stark:The Cast,"The Warriors are the artiest street gang you've ever seen. And what a surprise they'll be for anyone who's misled by the ads for ""The Warriors,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State and other theaters, and goes to the film expecting good old-fashioned head-bashing on a grand scale. There is head-bashing, of course, but it tends to be oddly fastidious. And the Warriors, when they aren't getting into fights, stand around very solemnly and only speak one at a time. Their diction is impeccable.But Walter Hill, who co-wrote and directed ""The Warriors,"" is onto something, provided an audience is willing to meet him halfway. The film is as handsome to watch as it is preposterous to listen to, full of gorgeous nocturnal city images that splash blaring neon colors against filthy, rain-slicked gray. Mr. Hill uses subways, jukeboxes, spectacularly eerie costumes and deserted streets to create a stark yet extravagant visual style, and a grimy little world in which everything looks curiously brand-new. Thanks to a lot of wipes and slow-motion shots, you are never in danger of forgetting that somebody clever is at the helm.Mr. Hill, who was a screenwriter before directing his first film, ""Hard Times,"" with Charles Bronson, can be exasperating in his fidelity to genre-movie conventions  last year, he worked so hard at making a film noir out of ""The Driver"" that he came up with film gris. This time, Mr. Hill has by no means relinquished his pretensions, but he is far more attentive to the demands of his story, which comes from a novel by Sol Yurick. Were it not for all those pregnant pauses, ""The Warriors"" might pass for a swift, streamlined adventure film in something like a futuristic cowboys-and-Indians mode.At the start of the movie, The Warriors and a hundred other gangs have each sent nine delegates to a rally in the Bronx. Each group of nine wears its own set of matching outfits, making the rally sequence the most stunning of the film's inventive set-pieces.At the rally, the leader of the Gramercy Riffs is assassinated; this is most unfortunate, because there are about 200 Gramercy Riffs and they're all impassive-looking blacks who carry hockey sticks and know karate. The Warriors didn't kill him  a lunatic named Luther, with a cry like a banshee's, did  but everyone thinks they're guilty and everyone's after them. The subway trip back to their home turf of Coney Island is a long one, punctuated by ingeniously plotted fights with other gangs and tight, portentous shots of the mouth of a woman disk jockey, who taunts the Warriors and plays songs like ""Nowhere To Run"" in their honor.Along the way, Mr. Hill stages some wonderful-looking encounters, including a confrontation with a gang on roller skates and a love scene in the path of an oncoming train. A particularly strong sequence is set in Riverside Park, where the Warriors are attacked by the Furies, who wear baseball uniforms and carry bats. The Furies also wear black and brightly colored face makeup reminiscent of ""Clockwork Orange,"" but when a Warrior punches a Fury, he doesn't get paint on his fist. That's the magic of movies.Most of the actors in ""The Warriors"" seem likely to have given wooden performances even if Mr. Hill hadn't directed them to. But a few of them  notably Michael Beck, James Remar and Brian Tyler  hold the screen even when they're affecting the most stoical of attitudes. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, as the obligatory pouty pick-up, and David Patrick Kelly, as crazy Luther, lend an unexpected humanity to Mr. Hill's glossy scheme. Thomas Waites is a promising actor who's as miscast here as he is in ""On The Yard."" Mr. Waites plays tough guys in both films, and in both he seems much less formidable than his surroundings.",1979-02-10T05:00:00+0000

In the United States, the importance of corn as a human food staple is little appreciated. Grown on more than a million farms, totaling more than 60 million acres, corn is this country's biggest and most valuable agricultural crop.

But as much as 90 percent the United States crop is feed corn, consumed by animals, ultimately to be eaten by people in the form of meat, milk, eggs and other animal products.

Although he is working here on the familiar issue of high culture and popular culture, what he does is fresh and new because he has extraordinary reserves of historical knowledge to bring to bear. He has always spoken with unmatched authority on writers such as James Fenimore Cooper and Mark Twain, who committed themselves to the public version of the world with an incau tious generosity and felt personally betrayed by the world's failure to live up to the values and principles it professed. Democracy and the Novel at first appears (like Virgin Land) a loose assemblage of topics, but, as in all Mr. Smith's work, the firm, judicious presence of the author provides the controlling form.

us,Article 3 -- No Title:A Half-World,"TIMELINESS has nothing to do with the worth of a film, though it can illuminate its values. ""The Cycle"" (Dayereh Mina), Darius Mehrrjui's Iranian film that opens today at the Public Theater, was made several years ago and was initially banned in its homeland. When it was released for export, the decision, I suspect, was made in an effort to demonstrate the freedom of Iran's artists under the Shah, who was receiving increasing criticism abroad for his repressive political policies at home.""The Cycle"" would be an interesting film under any circumstances, but to realize that it was produced when and where it was adds an extraordinary measure of interest. Here is an attempt to make a sort of Iranian ""Shoeshine,"" and though it lacks the profound irony of Vittorio De Sica's work and is sometimes too pretty, it is a remarkably vivid indictment of the political order that made it possible.The film is the story of the wayward rise of Ali, a young man from the country, who comes into the city (Teheran, I assume) with his ailing father seeking medical help. The penniless pair  without a stated past and no future  is befriended by several members of the staff of a large, modern hospital. However, Ali can make ends meet only by becoming a member of the half-world that is the connection between the well-fed, rich and powerful, and those who are utterly destitute. Ali will do anything for money, most of it legal but none of it ethical or moral.I've no idea if ""The Cycle"" has been cut somewhere along its way to this country, so I can't be sure whether its narrative rambles and jumps by accident or for the purpose of an overly ambitious structure. The film is full of little digressions that are not always dramatic in themselves but are essential to the sense of the movie, which is a devastating picture of a country in the midst of a revolution it doesn't understand and cannot control.The physical squalor and emotional confusion look Dickensian, though the details are of the 20th century. A commercial blood bank where the sick and the destitute sell their blood looks like Bedlam. The hospital, though airy and clean, is staffed largely by people who are too busy leading their own comparatively affluent lives to give much thought to the patients. Bribery is everywhere.We see the manager of a chicken farm destroying hundreds of chicks because, as he says, the cost of feed has become so high he can't afford to raise them. When Ali goes into the country, the landscape is no less brutal than that of the city, only somewhat more desolate. In this world, as seen by Mr. Mehrjui, it's always dusk, night or dawn. Even sunlight seems to be out of the reach of these people.The credits do not identify which actor plays which role, but the performances are uniformly excellent, especially the young man who plays Ali and the old fellow who plays his ailing, ill-tempered father.It's impossible to respond to ""The Cycle"" in quite the same way one might respond to, say, a film from Bulgaria. I've a suspicion  based on this one film  that Mr. Mehrjui's highly developed social conscience is not going to be especially pleased in the religious state that Iran's new rulers are likely to set up. What will happen to him?",1979-02-13T05:00:00+0000

us,The Indian Brunch: Fragrant Feast,"JULIE SAHNI was raised to be an achiever. When she was growing up in New Delhi during the 1940's, it was not just hoped, but expected, that she would make something of herself. A life in the kitchen was the last thing Mrs. Sahni's parents, both professionals, had in mind for the second of their four daughters. And, in fact, her achievements are considerable. She spent almost a decade as a professional dancer. She earned one degree in architecture, another in city planning. For the past nine years she has worked as an architect and designer for the city of New York. But what Mrs. Sahni really wants to do is cook. And so, rebelling in her own quiet way, she maintains her professional life while keeping alive her culinary passion. She teaches Indian cooking in her home in Brooklyn Heights, as well as in the Culinary Arts program at the New School for Social Research. Although while growing up in India she rarely cooked an entire meal on her own, she spent many hours around the kitchen, watching her mother and the family cook prepare the daily fare. She stored up her impressions so that someday she might recreate the spicy keernas, the puffy pooris and the sweet almond desserts of her childhood. While Indian cooking is her speciality, she is equally comfortable with the Chinese, French and Italian cuisines. I once went through a whole year where I cooked nothing but Chinese five nights a week, she said with a laugh, noting that she has taken cooking classes in several other cuisines. Now, more often than not, she prepares French and Italian foods during the weekend her native Indian dishes on weekends, when she spends her time testing recipes for classes and an upcoming cookbook. Often, a weekend Indian brunch will serve both as recipetesting session and as time to entertain. What I love about Indian food is the fragrance, she explained. When people think Indian food, they think of hotness, of spices, but they forget that it is the most aromatic of cuisines. I find Indian cooking not a science but an art, she went on, noting that there is not a great deal of complicated technique involved in preparing Indian food. Basically, if you know how to fry, there are few tricks to Indian food, she insisted. Spices, she said, are the most misunderstood ingredients in Indian cooking. Instead of thinking of spices as simply flavoring, they should be treated as a vegetable, and most should be cooked before eating. The reason people sometimes have digestion problems with Indian food is that they are eating raw spices. And some raw spices are very hard on the system, Mrs. Sahni explained. She suggested that when adding spices, particulary cumin or coriander, late in the preparation of a dish, the spices should always be dryroasted first, over medium heat in a wellseasoned pan. Mrs. Salmi also suggested that for use in Indian foods, the spices should be as fresh as possible, preferably purchased whole and ground just before using.

us,"Screen: 'Tracks,' Anti-Vietnam War Movie, Opens:Cross-Country Trip","""TRACKS"" is Henry Jaglom's heretofore ""invisible"" film that attempts to dramatize intellectual and moral outrage against American involvement in the Vietnam War. The film, which stars Dennis Hopper, was made four years ago. It has been shown at festivals around the world and has had a few commercial engagements here and abroad, but it is only today having its regular New York theatrical premiere at the Quad Cinema. That distributors should find it a chancey item is not difficult to understand.Though ""Tracks"" takes place in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon was announcing the signing of a ceasefire to end the war, the movie has the stoned, improvised look of an artifact out of the 1960's, having less to do with considered opposition to the war than with a vague sort of dissatisfaction with everything, and no idea what to do about it. ""Tracks"" is an inarticulate flower movie.The setting is a transcontinental train. Army Sergeant Jack Falen (Mr. Hopper), escorting the body of his dead war buddy home for burial, meets a cross section of middle America aboard the train. There are a pretty, essentially decent college girl Taryn Power (the late Tyrone Power's daughter), an elderly hippie (Dean Stockwell), who turns out to be a member of the militant left in flight from the law, an older woman (Barbara Flood), who rides trains for the casual sex that's available, and assorted types of businessmen, all of whom, it seems, work for the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Mr. Jaglom, whose first feature, (""A Safe Place""), was shown at the 1971 New York Film Festival, is sometimes very good at catching his actors (including Alfred Ryder, the film director) in moments that have a crazy sponteneity. Particularly funny is a chess expert played by Michael Emil and a real estate salesman played by Zack Norman. Mr. Norman has what are the film's best moments as he explains why he likes to eat the skin of a chicken instead of the meat. The insides of a chicken he says with the authority of a fanatic, are not exposed to ""the reality of the land.""This sort of thing is colorful, but it's not enough to make a movie. That ""Tracks"" lacks any real center is, I suspect, the joint failure of Mr. Jaglom, who wrote and directed it, and Mr. Hopper, whose sergeant seems less like the victim of the horrors of war than an actor playing with mannerisms. The mechanics of the performance are so apparent they subvert the film's claims to serious purpose and turn it into a cross-country ego trip. It is interesting to compare Mr. Hopper's performance here with the beautifully controlled one he was to give a couple of years later in Wim Wenders's ""The American Friend."" Same actor, entirely different results.As he did in ""A Safe Place"" Mr. Jaglom here displays a fondness for demonstrating fantasies, but in ""Tracks"" they are either superfluous or confusing and, finally, they utterly destroy what should be a shattering climax. One nice touch: Mr. Jaglom's use of mostly terrible World War II songs, which the sergeant plays on his portable tapedeck. It's not especially realistic, but it says more about the difference between Vietnam and other American wars than anything else in the film.",1979-02-16T05:00:00+0000

He knew the new French painting and the new French painters. He had come to know Diaghilev when Diaghilev was just a fat young man from the sticks who was very good at organizing exhibitions. He was in contact with gifted people all oven Europe, and in 1909 he and his fellowpainters, Wassily Kandinsky and Gabriele Mnter, founded a select society of artists that still lives in the history books.

us,Film: 'Pryor in Concert':Mime and Mimic,"JUST about nothing Richard Pryor has to say in ""Richard Pryor in Concert,"" a film recording of one of his 1978 performances, can be reprinted here, but in a way that's just as well. It's not Mr. Pryor's individual lines that make his show so wickedly funny, nor are the comic conceits that launch his various routines automatically uproarious. Mr. Pryor is a superb mime and a fabulous mimic, and he can use almost any topic, intrinsically funny or not, to introduce the brand of physical comedy that is especially his own.Prowling the stage impishly, slipping effortlessly from one hilarious impersonation to the next, he radiates an intensity that isn't often visible in even his very best feature-length acting performances. And his stage routine is so dependent on grimaces and gestures that his concert albums don't capture its full vitality. If you don't like Mr. Pryor's vocabulary  and it would take a lot of imagination to come up with a saltier one  then you may not find him funny here or anywhere else. But if you're even remotely well disposed toward what he does, then this is a whale of a show.Performing after a three-year hiatus in his concert schedule, Mr. Pryor has a calmer, more assured delivery than he sometimes has on record (where his routines have sometimes had a hysterical edge). He makes no bones about the difficulties he has had in the intervening time, even giving an uproarious account of the well-publicized incident that got him arrested. (He shot his car.) A lot of his material is personal, including an imitation of his father and a version of what his grandmother did when she found him snorting cocaine. When he jokes about sex, he's as disarmingly self-deprecating as Lenny Bruce.Perhaps the funniest section of the show, which was performed before a mostly white audience in Long Beach, Calif., has Mr. Pryor moving effortlessly from an account of how black people behave in the woods, to speculation about what a deer would do if it saw Leon Spinks, to the comedian's thoughts about boxing, which apparently came to a head when he stepped into a ring with Muhammad Ali during a benefit and wondered whether the Champ would remember this was supposed to be all in fun.When Mr. Pryor toys with a physical activity such as boxing, he suddenly divides himself into pieces, explaining that the mind will say this while the legs do that, and so on. This gambit is at its most biting in a routine about the heart attack Mr. Pryor suffered, an account of what his heart told his body as it dealt each murderous blow.",1979-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Nabokov's 'Despair':A Cousin of Lolita,"IN the 1965 preface to his revised edition of ""Despair,"" his novel first published in 1936. Vladimir Nabokov described the original Russian title, ""Otchayanie,"" as being ""a far more sonorous howl"" than the English word he had chosen. But ""Despair"" will do for both the novel and for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's elegant, comic, purposely precious film version, adapted by the playwright Tom Stoppard, who has been inspired by Nabokov to attain new heights of splendid lunacy, and acted by Dirk Bogarde, who gives one of the wittiest performances of his entire career. The film opens today at the Gemini II.Though Nabokov wrote ""Despair"" almost 20 years before ""Lolita,"" the two novels share something more than the author's very original sensibility, ""Despair's"" Hermann Karlovich is Lolita's indefatigable suitor, Humbert Humbert, somewhat younger, perhaps, and a tiny bit less polished, but equally blind and self-defeating in his obsessions. Like Humbert (and Nabokov), Hermann (Mr. Bogarde) is a Russian emigre, this time in Berlin in 1930. Hermann, who owns a small chocolate factory where everything is painted a soft lilac hue, from the delivery trucks to the gift boxes, is disassociated not only from the land where he grew up, but also from his wife, his business associates and, finally, from himself.When Hermann makes love to Lydia (Andrea Ferreol), his plump, pretty wife who has a fondness for baby talk (""intelligence"" says Hermann, ""would take the bloom off your carnality""), he mentally separates himself from the scene, sitting in the living room of their flat while he watches and stage-manages their play in the bedroom.Hermann is truly impossible  dandified, sarcastic and dishonest even about the details of his background. But, as he says at one point, ""All the information I have about myself is from forged documents."" With that acute sensitivity that often heralds approaching illness, Hermann responds to all of the world's vulgarities as if they were a kind of physical torture. An eyebrow twitches involuntarily when Lydia makes one of her egg-and-mild toddies, which she calls ""moggy-woggies."" He flinches as if threatened with a crowbar when Ardalion (Volker Spengler). Lydia's cousin and sometimes lover, a fat slob of an artist, appears before him dressed in nothing but a towel, his belly hanging over the top.But Hermann does love Lydia for all her sillinesses, probably because she loves him and finds him ever fascinating. ""How dare you come into the room partly clothed,"" he yells at Lydia when she enters their bedroom dressed only in a black slip. ""Off with it!""They do have fun, but they need money. It's to mend this need that Hermann devises a crazy insurance swindle, a scheme that is based on his use of a drifter named Felix (Klaus Lowitsch), who, Hermann is convinced, is his physical double, but who, as all the rest of us can see, bears little, if, any resemblance to him. Only a man so recklessly possessed could make such a mistake.Like the novel on which it is based, the film loses momentum as the machinery of the plot must be tended to near the end, but it's at this point one can fully appreciate the contributions by Mr. Fassbinder, Mr. Stoppard and Mr. Bogarde.Unlike some of his European colleagues who've not been able to make the transition to English-language films (I think especially of Alain Resnais and the late Luchino Visconti), Mr. Fassbinder succeeds brilliantly, with the great help, of course, of Mr. Stoppard. The baroque movements of the camera  it never sits if it can stand, and never stands if it can swoop and soar  produce a visual equivalent to the comic fussiness of the prose style of Nabokov's first-person narrative.Mr. Bogarde's prissy gestures, mixed with expressions of alarm and lust that are always conscious, as they are with someone a little beside himself, beautifully illuminate this seminal Nabokovian hero. Miss Ferreol is dainty, bovine, vulgar and always sweet, and Mr. Spengler, a red-haired German actor, is a mountain of unredeemable second-rateness.The Stoppard script is a joy for anyone who likes the English language. There are very few puns here. Instead, he has miraculously turned Nabokov's exposition into spoken dialogue that matches the tone of the original. ""A line has length but no breadth,"" says Hermann. ""If you could see it, it wouldn't be a line."" That's pure Stoppard, inspired by Nabokov, and the result is perfectly seamless.",1979-02-16T05:00:00+0000

A few years ago, Beckett and Pinter were the most admired playwrights of their time, especially among other playwrights, leading the movement toward the cool play set in a detached reality. But now, it would seem, the playwrights are beginning to agree with theatergoers, in recognizing that some human contact is needed in the theater.

us,"Screen: 'Ice Castles,' Skater's Story:Slush","THROUGH a flurry of figurative snowflakes, I was able to discern the following about ""Ice Castles"": It's about a pretty teen-age figure skater who wants to be a champion, has a terrible accident, and then becomes a champion just the same. This may not sound any too complicated, but its particulars are amazingly hard to follow.Donald Wrye, who directed the film and co-wrote its screenplay, has induced the cast to mumble any lines that stand some chance of advancing the plot. And his way of stringing scenes together invariably suggests that other scenes have been left out. When the story gets confusing, the ball is carried by Marvin Hamlisch's swelling score, which celebrates emotions the actors don't quite seem to be feeling. The score works like a bossy laugh-track on a television show.Lexie Winston, played by Lynn-Holly Johnson, is a small-town Iowa girl who at first does most of her skating at the town pond, or at a rink-cum-bowling alley run by hard-bitten Colleen Dewhurst, who is apparently Lexie's coach. Lexie lives alone with her father (Tom Skerritt), who acts like some kind of half-mad backwoods trapper for reasons that are not explained.Her farm-boy sweetheart, played by Robby Benson, doesn't behave for one moment as if he knew which end of a cow did the mooing, but let that pass. It's baffling enough that Mr. Benson seems to be having a hockey career that conflicts with Lexie's skating, and that all of their romantic problems are explained in one long-distance telephone conversation, which is only partly audible and full of long pauses.Never mind the warm-up, it's Lexie's accident that's supposed to put a lump in your throat. After she has become successful and celebrated, a change that is signaled by her ever more elaborate hairdos, she winds up at a cocktail party, staring morosely at the ice sculpture in the middle of the room. This prompts her to go out to a deserted rink and skate her troubles away, but she slips and hurts her head in slow motion.Cut to a stark, mostly white hospital room full of elaborate equipment and  such is the logic of Mr. Wrye's staging  one wall-sized mural of autumnal trees. The doctors are testing for brain damage, and their results are characteristically fuzzy. ""This sort of thing usually gets better or worse in a few days after the injury,"" goes the diagnosis. ""And after that, what you have is what you have.""Mr. Benson, as the sentimental softie of the piece, has some nice moments after Lexie's accident, but the film's muddled beginning makes his a particularly incomplete character.It's too bad that Mr. Wrye's bungling renders the story sob-proof, because injured-athlete sagas are usually so hard to resist. But Bill Butler's handsome cinematography captures settings that aren't brought to life by the screenplay, and the cast's crisper, more straight-forward actors  Mr. Skerritt, Miss Dewhurst, David Huffman and Jennifer Warren, who plays Lexie's big-time coach  are hopelessly undermined by the choppiness of their roles.Miss Johnson, a screen newcomer who was formerly with the Ice Capades, has a role designed to make minimal demands on her acting abilities; for the most part, all she has to do is look uncomplicatedly sweet and skate. She seems to skate beautifully, but Mr. Wrye  who should have been forced to sit through ""The Turning Point"" until he got this right  captures skating scenes that are utterly without magic.By not showing any of Lexie's competitors on the ice, he makes it hard for an audience to appreciate her special talent. By cueing his stadium crowds to leap to their feet and applaud Lexie's performance unanimously, he creates an unreasonably stacked deck. By shooting her, inexplicably, from the ice's point of view, he sometimes makes her look like an oncoming sub-marine.""Ice Castles"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), because of some moderately harsh language in its screenplay.",1979-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Australian Hawthorne Romance:From Down Under,"HORROR need not always be a long-fanged gentleman in evening clothes or a dismembered corpse or a doctor who keeps a brain in his gold fish bowl. It may be a warm sunny day. the innocence of girlhood and hints of unexplored sexuality that combine to produce a euphoria so intense it becomes transporting, a state beyond life or death. Such horror is unspeakable not because it is gruesome but because it remains outside the realm of things that can be easily defined or explained in conventional ways.It's also the fascination of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" the Australian film directed by Peter Weir, who was introduced to American audiences late last year by his moodily impressive ""The Last Wave.""""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, is about three virginal young women and a school mistress who, on Valentines Day, 1900, disappear without trace while on an expedition to a splendid geological outcropping called Hanging Rock. The movie would like us to believe it's based on fact though it's really based on a novel by Joan Lindsay. Whatever the origins the story provides Mr. Weir with material for a kind of Australian horror-romance that recalls Nathaniel Hawthorne's preoccupation with the spiritual and moral heritage of his own New England landscape.In ""The Last Wave"" Mr. Weir made what seemed to me to be the grave mistake of attempting to provide answers for the mysteries he so beautifully set up earlier in the film. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is different. It's a movie composed almost entirely of clues. Its methods are illusory, not necessarily to trick us but to force us to stretch our imaginations. Instead of exposition, Mr. Weir and his screen writer, Cliff Green, deal in moods.The opening section of the film, in which we are introduced to the students at Mrs. Appleyard's College for young women, dramatizes their innocence with such intensity that we are immediately aware of sexual longings everywhere: students for students, students for school mistress, school mistress for someone unknown, even the maid for the gardener. Exchanged with high giggles are Valentines that pledge eternal love. Quite arbitrarily one of the girls is prevented from going on the picnic. Why? The only explanation is that the head mistress. Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), is a monster. Another girl, carried away by her anticipation of the glorious day and by her own intimations of immortality, remembers Poe's lines. ""All that we see or seem / is but a dream within a dream.""The heat of the day is as much of a presence during the picnic as the rock formation that provides shadow for the group. Mr. Weir makes us believe that the landscape is alive. When four of the girls set off to explore the rock, ignoring warnings of venomous snakes and poisonous ants, we have the impression that they are being called. As they climb higher and higher into the volcanic outcropping, one girl, the chubby one named Edith, panics and runs screaming back to the base. For some unexplained reason, the dry, spinterish teacher of geometry decides to follow the three who are climbing the rock. Later, after the disappearance of the group has been confirmed, a witness reports having seen the teacher at some distance, running across a plateau, in her pantaloons.I can't tell you how the story is resolved, though some people will feel cheated. That, however, will be to have anticipated a different movie. I'm not sure that Mr. Weir has succeeded in evoking his ""dream within a dream"" world without using one or two more red herrings than are absolutely necessary, but because the film has a hypnotic spell I accept its excesses.""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is very nicely cast, beginning with Rachel Roberts and including Anne Lambert as Miranda, the beautiful girl who leads her classmates into oblivion; Karen Robson as Irma, the one member of the expedition who survives but remembers nothing; Dominic Guard as a young man who shares Irma's forgotten secret; and Christine Schuler as the chubby girl who complains when she's included in a plan and complains even more when she's left out.Though, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" has immense feeling for an interest in the Australian landscape, it is anything but a picturesque or provincial film. Among other things it knows that there are some romantic longings, especially in the young, that are so overwhelming they simply cannot be contained. The result is a movie that is both spooky and sexy.",1979-02-23T05:00:00+0000
