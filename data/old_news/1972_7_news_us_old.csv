us,"Film: Idiosyncratic 'Duck, You Sucker':Leone's New Western Is Set in Mexico","A thoughtful person may make a thoughtful analysis of ""Duck, You Sucker,"" Sergio Leone's newest, most awkwardly titled Western, but I doubt that it could be even as provocative assaya thoughtful analysis of the work of Herman Wouk.All of Leone's idiosyncrasies are apparent in this tale set in Mexico during the revolution, especially his romantic attachment for macho heroes who are either greedy or disillusioned, and sometimes both. ""Duck, You Sucker"" is a practical guide to Leone's various affectionsfor explicit violence, for bizarre historical detail (a stagecoach that is as big and plush as a railroad car), for excruciatingly tight close-ups (which make you feel as if you're looking at the film through a venetian blind), and for cryptic narrative twists that suddenly shoot the story forward, only to be laboriously explained at some later point.The idiosyncrasies are there, all right, but they have never seemed less interesting.Leone, whose early films (""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" among others) were condemned (unjustly, I think) for their extraordinary nihilism, is going soft. The end effect of this long, rambling film is one of awful over-stuffedness. Like a chi-chi set designer's dream of what a turn-of-the-century whorehouse parlor might have looked like, it contains too many gewgaws and too many knickknacks. In particular, there's too much plot as well as too much acting by Rod Steiger, as a sometimes Yiddish-sounding Mexican bandit, and by James Coburn, as an Irish terrorist who periodically suffers terrible bouts of flashbacks (to his troubles at home), a disease that can be fatal to this kind of movie.One thing about Leone's films does continue to fascinate me. No matter where they're made (usually around Almeria, Spain), no matter who's in them (American stars and European supporting casts), and no matter what language is on the soundtrack (English, mostly dubbed), they always have the strange look and displaced sound of an unmistakably Italian director's dream of what Hollywood movies should be like, but aren't.",1972-07-01T05:00:00+0000

The first volume, In the Animal Kingdom, followed Gerhard Blau, Orcus Berrigan and the Indian woman Sawpootway to the edge of the Rockies in 1779. The new book is Blau's imagined account of his friends' lives 20 years later. Having parted with the Berrigans and fearful that they may no longer exist, Blau renews his feelings for them by inventing a fictive world in which they may now live. Just as his friends exist only in his imagination, Blau reveals them as living primarily in their own. Ignoring outward ad venture, he concentrates on a per ceptual drama: the way his friends respond to the wilderness on the screens of their minds. Thus, his nar rative is relatively uneventful. A trapper named Legget kidnaps the Berrigans' son in response to a hu miliating practical joke staged by Sawpootway, and most of the novel describes the elder Berrigans' search for the missing boy. After finding him, they return home only to learn that their daughter has recently eloped with a stranger.

Wilson became the embodi ment of social and cultural continuity, a mediator between past and present, be tween literature and politics, scholarship and journalism.

That this could happen, that Horgan's account of his involvement with music he had not even heard is entirely convincing and under standable, is worth pondering. It was not a matter of a young person be coming interested in a composer's work after reading critical accounts of it, but rather of the instantaneous acceptance of this composer's work, sound unheard, as the supreme ar tistic expression of our century.",1972-07-02T05:00:00+0000

His ideas are far out, compared with the cautious Vera proposal, but they are important because they often provide a theoretical under pinning for heroinmaintenance partisans. Taking heroin, he says, is logically and philosophically indistinguishable from smoking, drinking, overeating and a whole lot of other bad habits. Heroin, Glasser contends, is simply one of many harmful substances available to us. Indeed, the number of heroin addicts is far smaller than the number of smokers and alcoholics. There are 44.5 million adult smokers in the country, nine million alcoholics anddepending on whom you believebetween 300,000 and 560,000 addicts. If Gil Hodges dropped dead on the golf course from a heroin overdose, it would be a national scandal; from cigarettesmoking it makes no impact, says Glasser. The whole thing strikes me as com pletely irrational. Society's attempt to treat heroin differently from ciga rettes or alcohol has been a disastercreating a spiraling crime rate that is fueling a very repressive kind of politics in this country. Glasser would decriminalize heroin and make it available in pharmacies for addicts. He says he is uncertain whether it should be freely availablelike cigarettes or alcoholor under the kinds of restrictions placed on insulin for diabetics. Some of his colleagues in the Civil Liberties Union favor governmentrun maintenance clinics, but Glasser fears that clinics would have an unhealthy element of social control.",1972-07-02T05:00:00+0000

The most luxurious sausage in the world, its casing is veal breast and its forcemeat includes more veal (from the leg), sweetbreads and calf's brain for tex ture, mushrooms, peas, pine nuts, cheese and seasonings.

us,Screen: Lenny Returns:Documentary on Life of Bruce Opens at Elgin,"Cliff Gorman's recent ""Lenny""  the play and the performance bothconveyed an infinitely stronger sense of reality, bizarre comic talent and personal doom than yesterday's new documentary film, ""Lenny Bruce Without Tears.""Fred and Barbara Baker have obviously gone to a lot of trouble to assemble movie footage of the real Bruce performing before club audiences. The photography is understandably shadowy. But the bald truth is that you simply can't hear much of the fuzzy soundtrack, as Bruce carbolically lances sex, religion, racial bigotry and plain old hypocrisy. There is a long, equally muffled sequence of a younger Bruce during a guest shot on a Steve Allen television show, suggesting the volcanic brilliance to come.Furthermore, the footage continually cuts from Bruce in action to a random mulligan stew of meaningless clips as the comedian's voice continues.Add to this a continual stream of tributes from people like Mort Sahl, Kenneth Tynan and Malcolm Muggeridge, especially at the end, when we see Bruce stumbling into various courts in a series of narcotics arrests. There is a skein of biographical data. The footage hits hard only near the close. That's when we see a ghostly, glassy-eyed Bruce croaking to an interviewer and doing a pathetically unfunny pantomime of drug addiction.Chances are that the 1967 movie titled ""Lenny Bruce,"" which reportedly held to his performing, was much more effective. The man on the Elgin Theater screen yesterday seemed but a frenzied shadow, funny only when you could understand him.",1972-07-06T05:00:00+0000

In its simplicity, sensitivity and lyrical flow, this deeply-felt Soviet-sponsored drama and its exotic locale are refreshingly remote from the sex, strife and gore cluttering Fun City screens.The very setting, a tribal village in Kirghizia, dwarfed by towering peaks on the Soviet-Chinese border, is a fascinating novelty. So are the expressive Oriental faces of the cast, speaking their native Turkic (with good English titles).The story, by Chinghiz Aitmatov, a Turkic author, unfolds the wonder and anguish of a growing boy as he watches the furtive love of two adults he adores. These are his vivacious, lonely sister-in-law, Jamilya, whose indifferent husband is away at war, and a convalescent soldier helping the villagers feed grain to a railroad line. World War II, in a sharp pinpoint of irony, remains far, far away.But the exquisite direction of Irina Poplavskaya pulls in the human drama closely and touchingly, wisely holding to the viewpoint of the impressionable boy. And since the lad, played with earthy conviction by Nasredin Dubashev, is also a budding painter, Miss Poplavskaya and her superb photographer have a visual field day.The craggy panoramas, the foaming wheat fields and the personal drama are effectively intercut with primitive color sketches, as the general footage subtly shifts from sepia to black and white. It is a trickmost pictures would gum it upthat works beautifully. So, for that matter, do the performances of Natalya Arinbasarova and Suimenkul Chkmorov, as the lovers, and a striking musical score with folk-tune flavoring.

us,'Butterflies Are Free' Arrives,"""Butterflies Are Free,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is Leonard Gershe's Broadway comedy recycled as a movie with the density of Jell-o.Edward Albert, the son of Eddie Albert and Margo, makes his film debut as Don, the young blind man trying to make a life on his own in a San Francisco garret. Eileen Heckart plays his pushy, suburban mother who, when the chips are down, is selfless enough to make any matinee lady proud to identify with her, and Goldie Hawn is the desperately eccentric girl next door who falls in love with him.She quotes Dylan Thomas without knowing it, Charles Dickens when she thinks it's Mark Twain and describes sex with Don as being like the Fourth of July and Christmas combined. Don, who likes to be read to from Time, Newsweek and The Berkeley Barb, is enchanted, as obviously was yesterday's early morning audience at the Music Hall.""Butterflies Are Free,"" the play, ranks with such other glories of the modern American theater as ""A Majority of One,"" ""The Impossible Years"" and ""Never Too Late.""

us,Film: Elsa's Cubs Pad In:' Living Free' Tracks Trio Raised by Humans,"For some reason, the British sponsors of the popular ""Born Free"" have waited six years to dispatch a sequel. But all that really matters is that the sequel, ""Living Free,"" is excellent screen fare for children.Remember Elsa the Lioness, the one raised like a house pet by the Adamsons, the enterprising British couple in Africa? Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers have now scooted out of the picture as the couple. A new pair of actors, Susan Hampshire and Nigel Davenport, spend the new picture fretting over Elsa's three cubs, protecting the growing trio even during hunger raids and finallyand about timecarting them off in a distant game preserve for safety.A prologue, with the two new stars, neatly recaps the first movie, introduces the baby cubs (their papa slinks off) and has Elsa (or her double), expiring as regally as Garbo in ""Camille.""The early scenes are best, with the three cubs tentatively on their own and edging into the wilds, treed by a fierce mother rhino, routing a python and being cold-shouldered by other animal species. The color is really lovely; the terrain looks as African as can be and there is one magnificent sweep of flapping flamingos blotting the horizon.As cubs, especially, the trio are spunky, fascinating critters to watch. For that matter, the charming Miss Hampshire (of television's ""The Forsyte Saga"") and Mr. Davenport are natural and winning. However, sharp-eyed youngsterswhether or not they saw ""Born Free""may wonder about the childless couple's kindly obsession, the only word, with these hulking beasts.Furthermore, the action turns rather tedious toward the end before the grown animals are trucked to safety 700 miles away. ""Born Free"" history is repeating itself and the freshness and novelty wear thin. Still, these are enterprising, well-meaning adults, the animalsall of them  and the exotic scenery are diverting and the picture is clean as a lion's tooth, not that we've ever crawled up close for a look. ""Living Free"" is close enough to sensible entertainment for the children  and bright ones, too.",1972-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,' The Godson' (No Relation to 'Godfather') Opens,"The American title, ""The Godson,"" is not only meaningless, it is misleading, since it suggests a relationship with Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"" that doesn't exist. Although the film contains very little dialogue, the dubbed English soundtrack is most disorienting. Among other things, it gives you the feeling that Paris has been occupied by body-snatchers, some of whom sound like New York cab drivers and some like bottom-rung nightclub comedians imitating Charles Boyer. But don't be put off.""The Godson,"" which opened yesterday at the Juliet I Theater is actually ""Le Samourai,"" Jean-Pierre Melville's immaculate 1967 French melodrama about the life and death of a hired killer, whose code of honor is no less rigid, romantic and (in our eyes) absurd than that of the Bushido of Japan.In Melville's world, Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is a beautiful misfit, an individualist who remains outside a society of complicated interdependencies, a performing artist who expresses himself entirely in terms of the grace and efficiency of his services. He makes $4,000 a contract, yet he lives in seedy solitude, in a high-ceilinged, almost barren room he shares with a caged bird. There's a shower in the kitchen and, in the closet, a couple of well-cut dark suits, a black dress topcoat, a trenchcoat and a gray fedora. Nothing else. He has a mistress of sorts (Nathalie Delon), but he apparently sees her only when he needs an alibi.The story of ""The Godson"" is the story of Jef's last contract. It has the form of a conventional policier, about the loner in conflict with both the law and the syndicate that hired him. The form, in fact, is so conventional, so full of the set pieces that are obligatory in this kind of film (the midnight poker game, the chase through the subway, the encounter with the beautiful woman of ambiguous loyalty) that ""The Godson"" comes close to being parody.The dreadful dubbing reinforces this impression, as does the stoicism of Jef under the most extraordinary circumstances, as if the expression of surprise would be a capital sin.Melville's interest, however, is the form, which is that of the American gangster film rediscovered and refined to reflect no special real world but a world of moral systems working at cross purposes, like a telephone switchboard gone haywire. At the center of ""The Godson"" is a man of almost loony implacability, who, when he fails, doesn't hesitate to commit his own kind of hara-kiri.In France, Melville is regarded as the patron saint of what was once called the nauvelle vague. He has made 12 films sines 1947, only one of which (""Doulos, The Finger Man""), as far as I can learn, has been commercially relased in this country. ""L'Aine Des Ferchaux"" was shown as ""Magnet of Doom"" at the first (1963) New York Film Festival but was badly received because of the anachronisms in its pretended American setting.""The Godson,"" with Delon doing what he does best (looking impassive and slightly tarnished), is a lovely introduction to the work of a most idiosyncratic filmmaker. If you have any doubt about this, just compare ""The Godson"" withsayanything by Henri Verneuil (""The Burglars,"" ""The Sicilian Clan,"" etc.), whose films draw on the same sources as Melville's but, in spite of a lot of jazzy claptrap, haven't a single thought among them.",1972-07-13T05:00:00+0000

Nobody, not even Tom Landry [the Dallas coach] knows where they are right now. Thomas has been renegotiating a threeyear contract with Tex Schramm, the club president.

us,Screen: 2 Chillers for the Hot Weather,"Britain's Hammer Films, which has been regularly grinding out studiously manufactured little exercises in vintage bloodlettingin color,  has done it again with ""Hands of the Ripper"" and ""Twins of Evil,"" which surfaced at local houses with all the shock effects of weird fairy tales.However, credit the Hammer movie teams with providing a couple of variations on standard horror themes that should send geneticists, if not the paying customers, scurrying off to psychiatrists' couches. In ""Twins of Evil,"" for example, comely twin sisters are turned into vampires by that scion of a long line of old Mittelcuropa's ""undead,"" Count Karnstein, which probably is a first for the cinema.On the other hand, it is not ungallant to reveal, since it's disclosed early in the movie, that ""Hands of the Ripper"" has a good deal of ghoulish truck with the idea that that most storied Victorian killer, Jack the Ripper, has passed his gory predilections on to his pretty blonde daughter. And that too must set a precedent since the identity of Jack the Ripper is still an official mystery.Let's say that Mary and Madelaine Collinson, the actual identical-twin actresses of ""Twins of Evil,"" are nobly endowed enough to keep any red-blooded boy interested in vampirism. The rest of the costumed crew, led by that veteran horror hand, Peter Cushing, as the twins' witchhunting uncle, who chases the fanged Count and his retinue, hardly give ""Twins of Evil"" a good name.The fog-filled London settings of ""Hands of the Ripper"" do not shroud the fact that Angharad Rees, as the young, schizoid heroine, is not in the hands of a fully qualified medical man. Eric Porter, as a dour, dedicated pioneer ""follower of that man Freud,"" is decidedly anxious to cure her beyond the call of duty and the Hippocratic Oath. But Miss Rees keeps hearing those voices and stabbing people until she and the good doctor wind up dead in St. Paul's Cathedral. All things considered, Freud himself might have had a hard time with Miss Rees and company.",1972-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Ralph Nelson's 'Wrath of God',"Suppose you have the politics: violent revolution. Then you pick the time and the place: 1920's, somewhere south of Mexico. If you add the mansay, a bearish Boston priest who Is Not What He Seems (or is he?)and provide him with the machine  an improbable ancient touring caryou need only find the pride and the passion, and you will have a movie.I'm not even sure you will need film and camera. A movie will form just by the natural disposition of things. Of course it won't be a very good movie, and it will almost unavoidably resemble Ralph Nelson's ""The Wrath of God,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.""The Wrath of God"" has the politics, the time and place, the man and the machine. It also has some passion (Paula Pritchett in braids and Indian buckskins) and, between John Colicos and Frank Langella at opposite ends of the political spectrum, it has somewhat more neurotic pride than it knows what to do with.The man is Robert Mitchum, a priest defrocked by his own goodness, and he is joined by Ken Hutchison, who plays an Irish adventurer, and Victor Buono, who shamelessly and quite expertly plays Sidney Green-street.There is also a plot and much meaning, but to describe either would run to greater length and intricacy than roll-call at the Democratic National Convention, and both mainly serve the picturesque qualify of the elements  place, politics, man, machine, etc.rather than the other way round. But with so much junk in one pile, it would be sad indeed if there weren't a little quality at the edges.And as in all the Ralph Nelson films I have ever seen, that quality rests in the exuberance of performance and in a certain commitment to whatever dumb thing is going on at any moment. There is an active integrity in all this that, though never enough to make the movie good, is occasionally able to make this bad movie admirable.The cast is mostly excellent. Not only Mitchum and the fine Ken Hutchison (who is virtually unknown here) but also all the countless revolutionaries who die like flies, or praise the Lord, or even dance in the streets when the crazy screenplay calls for it.And I cannot finally condemn a film in which the heroine (the beauteous Indian maiden Chela), silent since she saw her parents killed long years before, suddenly regains her speech just in time to warn her lover of a perfidious assassin's bullet. Such miracles, in this day and age, bespeak a hokum beyond the reach of art.",1972-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"There is a verbal sketch by a contemporary of Denis Diderot descanting in old age on a bewildering variety of topics in his usual mercurial and volatile way to young man whom he had never seen before and who had dropped by only to pay homage to a revered elder. It is a charming and vivid piece with just enough malice to add savor. Diderot laughed at it himself when he read it. I cite it to indicate that if Arthur M. Wilson had wished in his life of the 18thcentury French writer and philosopher to consider Diderot simply as an eccentric but attractive genius he could easily have fleshed out the sketch of a singular and superbly alive personality, who knew the most signifcant figures of his age and who helped shape the next one. But Mr. Wilson, a historican and biographer now retired from Dartmouth, has withstood that temptation. Diderot is important to us as editor of the illustrious Encyclopedie, the single most influential literary document of its time, and of such books as Rameau's Nephew and D'Alembert's Dream. As a result, the Wilson biography is really a branch of intellectual history. The substance of the Encyclopedie receives as much attention as Diderot's chronology, and Mr. Wilson gives more attention to the analysis of Diderot's thought than to the minutiae of his daytoday living. Not that those details are missing. But the author makes the intellectual ferment, the disputes over ideas, the challenges of friends and opponents as exciting as his subject's clandestine marriage or his long, ardent wooing of his mistress, Sophie Volland. (There surely must be another wordsomething more domesticfor a woman who retains the devotion of a man for 30 years.) Diderot's range of interest was so wide and his anticipations of modern thought so numerous that the book Diderot becomes in effect an introductory study of the Enlightenment.",1972-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Cops Take Rap in 'Fuzz':Detective Shenanigans Exhibited at Victoria Raquel Welch Plays Endangered Decoy,"""Fuzz looks more like a dress rehearsal than a finished film, a very dry run for something that is apparently meant to be a comedy-melodrama about ineptitude, especially the day-to-day ineptitude of a group of detectives attached to a Boston precinct station.When Detective Eileen McHenry (Raquel Welch) is acting as a decoy to catch a local rape artist, she almost succeeds in becoming his victim. Another stake-out comes close to failure because two detectives, played by Jack Weston and Burt Reynolds (his Zapata mustache notwithstanding), get tangled up in their disguises, which are nuns' habits.The milieu is forlongly realistic, as are the anonymous pickpockets, petty hoods, murderers and crazies who are shuttled through the station, mostly, however, for laughs. The attitude of the movie is best defined when a bungling detective shoots himself in the foot and we are asked to slap thighs with delight. There is no great amount of blood on the screen, which, I suppose, is meant to temper the spectacle of cars being blown up, of people being picked off by snipers and of Skid Row bums being set on fire by bored juvenile delinquents.Perhaps because it's aimed at people with minimum attention spans, the film contains several more plots than are strictly necessary, or than can be decently integrated by Evan Hunter, who adapted his own novel to the screen, and by Richard A. Colla, who directed the film in such short takes that even the seasons outside the precinct station don't seem to match. One minute it looks like deep winter, the next minute early fall.It's a measure of somethingthough I'm not sure of whatthat the straightest performance is given by Raquel Welch, who isn't around much of the time. When she is, she looks as irritated, but as resolutely patient as Gloria Steinem defending women's rights on a TV talk show. Jack Weston and Burt Reynolds, both of whom have been good comedians in the past, play in their roles as if performing on a Las Vegas stage to an audience of pals, including Don Rickles, who seems, unfortunately, to have presented Reynolds with his style of delivery.",1972-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The social contract explained and defended,"For too long now, the main tradition of moral philosophy has been utilitarian in its broad assumptions: people ought to work for the greatest happiness of the greatest number of their fellowmen; minorities should submit to the interests of the majority. But utilitarian attitudes are incompatible with our moral judgment and with the principles on which our Constitution rests. It is, therefore, a crucial task of moral and political philosophy to make clear the inadequacy of utilitarian concepts and, more important, to provide a persuasive alternative to them. In the opinion of John Rawls, professor of philosophy at Harvard, the social contract theory of Rousseau and Kant provides the main such alternative. And it is no accident that the Founding Fathers looked to this theory, in Locke's version of it, for their main philosophical doctrines. In recent times, however, this tradition has seemed unavailable to sophisticated opinion. For modern men cannot take seriously the myth on which the theory appears to rely an actual contract agreed upon by solitary primitives determined to create the first societyand modern philosophy has been inclined to agree with Bentham's view that any appeal to natural rights is nothing more than nonsense on stilts.",1972-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Peirce describes in detail, the physical characteristics of their major cities and adjoining countryside, he is most concerned with the residents behavior: how they make their living, the churches they attend, the schools they send their children to, how they spend their leisure.

In subject matter they range from literary essays (I. L. Peretz, Jacob Glatstein) to scholarly studies (Max Weinreich, C. Bezalel Sherman) to fragments of autobiographical memoir (Emanuel Ringelblum) to selections from historical works (Abraham Heschel) to cultural interpretation (Hayim Greenberg). The quality of the work is not so high as in the earlier collections, for Yiddish lacked the cultural security and intellectual sophistication the essay demands; but these examples are important because they show a now almost vanished world losing some if its insularity as it reaches out into the modern age.

Some of it is very revealing of the Arabs and their ways: her picture, for instance, of the Egyptian upper classes lounging over cocktails in an exclusive Cairo club in Israel she senses the anguish of a people tormented by what an endless war may force them to become. To give her book latelate news value, she has capped it with an urgent title and preface, auoting the warning of U Thant that the ArabIsraeli conflict may become the new 100 years war.

This egg mass is an inch or more long and about a halfinch in width and looks something like a piece of chamois leather with a velvety surface. A single egg mass transported to an area hitherto free of this pest could start a fresh outbreak.

The closer a social institution resembles a military one the more conformity becomes a first principle.

There is no place for the maverick, for the Billy Budds, for the Prewitts in such an arrangement.

An eccentric with a personal view of the joba policeman, say, with his own penal codewill stand out like a painted bird, and the system will either embrace him or destroy him, more likely the latter. James Mills, who has written about crime and justice in his previous books, The Prosecutor and Panic in Needle Park, has documented the above thesis in his new novel, Report to the Commissioner.

us,Disney's 'Napoleon',"No, ""Napoleon and Samantha"" aren't Bonaparte and a lady love. They're two winning youngsters, a boy and a girl, with a pet lion and this is a Disney picture.As Disney features go, it's quite nice, though without much snap. The two children, red-headed Johnny Whitaker and especially Jodie Foster as his saucy chum, are appealing. So is their shaggy-maned pet, a big, indolent pussycat who perks up and swats around a mountain lion and a bear (no real rough stuff) on cue.Against the backdrop of some fetching mountain scenery, Will Geer, as a kindly grandpa, dispenses sensibility and wisdom and Michael Douglas plays a sturdy, clean-cut hippie type, for a change. Both actors are excellent. There's some commotion at the end with Douglas and the police racing to a mountain cabin to save the children. They're spunky enough, generally, to take care of themselves. All in all, prodded by Bernard McEveety's direction, the picture coasts along easily on its own genial hominess.Its prime spectacle is a three-way chase. Tearing away in front and squawking like crazy is a white rooster named Doodle-Do pursued by a mountain lion who is pursued by the hero lion, called Major.The children should enjoy this one. They did, audibly, yesterday at the Juliet 2 Theater.Disney's 'Napoleon'",1972-07-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Eastwood Western,"For perhaps its first half-hour, John Sturges's new Western, ""Joe Kidd,"" looks surprisingly good. It seems restrained, relaxed, unfashionably out of the current mode in its commitment to people and horses rather than to sadistic monsters and machines. Nothing remarkable, but modestly decenta feeling that persists, with continually diminishing assurance, almost until the climax, when everything is thrown away in a flash of false theatrics, foolish symbolism and what I suspect is sloppy editing.That ""everything"" is indeed a fairly conventional story about land rights in New Mexico at the turn of the century. There is an evil land baron (Robert Duvall), a leader of the people (John Saxon), a beautiful woman of high principle (Stella Garcia) and an enigmatic loner (Clint Eastwood) who really determines the action. In a very mild way, the film supports the rights of a dispossessed Mexican minority. But no matter what the particular sympathies, politics in Westerns tends toward autocracy, and ""Joe Kidd"" ends with Clint Eastwood as judge, jury, and executioner in a killing that is of course supposed to change the moral nature of the world.Like so many Western heroes, Joe Kidd figures even in his own time as an anachronism  powerful through his instincts mainly, and through the ability of everybody else, whether in rage or gratitude, to recognize in him a quality that must be called virtue. The great value of Clint Eastwood in such a position is that he guards his virtue very cannily, and in the society of ""Joe Kidd,"" where the men still manage to tip their hats to the ladies, but just barely, all the Eastwood effects and mannerisms suggest a carefully preserved authenticity.I think it is a very good performance in context. Ultimately, it is the only real point of interest to ""Joe Kidd,"" and especially interesting because in recent years the Eastwood point of view has appeared mostly as ancillary to the larger vision of the director Don Siegel (""Dirty Harry,"" ""Beguiled,"" etc.). What emerges here is a kind of authoritative normalcy, an actor's gift to an ordinary film that at least gives him reasonable space to breathe.""Joe Kidd,"" which also offers the good cinematography of Bruce Surtees, and a quite notable collection of bad guys, beginning with Don Stroud, who are set up only to be put down by Clint Eastwood, opened yesterday at three Trans-Lux theaters.",1972-07-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Women's Lib,"The women's liberation movement must have had some effect practically everywhere on this troubled globe by now with the possible exception of the Gobi Desert. But in ""Stand Up and Be Counted,"" which turned up at local houses yesterday, the women's justifiable push for parity with males is merely good for some pithy, explicit dialogue, a few gags and giggles and fewer constructive answers. As an examination of current revolution. ""Stand Up and Be Counted"" erratically skips between comedy and serious causes with somewhat less than impressive impact either way.The hearts and the causes of all concerned appear to be in the right places. In essence, however, Jackie Cooper, who is making his feature directorial debut here from the script of Bernard Slade, a newcomer to movies, focuses mainly on women's lib as it affects several families in photogenic Denver, where the movie was largely shot in lovely color. The disturbing issues are still disturbing.As a fashion magazine writer sent to cover the lib scene in Denver, her home town, Jacqueline Bisset is decorative but as unbelievable in the role as her English accent. And her unresolved liaison with Gary Lockwood, as an airline pilot, is not an endorsement of the movement either. Lee Purcell, as her militantly feminist sister who arranges to become pregnant without romance or marriage, and Anne Francine, as their wise, indulgent mother, do have some incisive moments.Some natural portrayals are contributed by Steve Lawrence, in his debut as a worried ad man, and Loretta Swit, as the mother of his four children who is struggling for identity as a fashion designer. Effective too are Stella Stevens as a sexpot wife and Hector Elizondo as her husband, a roughhewn lingerie tycoon who is forced to appreciate her as something more than a sex object.However, an outspoken gab fest among the dissident distaffers and several demonstrations do more than family strife to dispel a remark in the film that lib is simply ""seven women with hairy legs and a genius for getting on the Johnny Carson Show."" Unfortunately, the good fight still needs fighting after everyone here has been counted.",1972-07-20T05:00:00+0000

How? When a ceiling in their 600-year-old Frankfurt palace falls on their heads.At one time or another most of us have seen ceilings fallin kitchens, in living rooms, in bathroomsusually because of faulty plumbing. It's no fun and always a mess, with the plaster dust and all. But this one was obviously a whopper, being high and probably marble.It's an indication of the difficulty I had in relating to ""The Man"" that for the rest of the movie, which only exploits ceilings as melodramatic conveniences, I kept wondering what really happened. Hadn't anyonethe C.I.A. or somebodychecked out the palace? Had the Russians been fiddling around? Did a loo leak? I simply couldn't buy the casual explanation: ""Well, you know those old palaces, Jim.""About halfway through ""The Man,"" one comes to realize that, in its own unwitting way, the film is much more interested in contemplating incompetence than in presenting any ideas about politics, race relations, international diplomacy, personal ambition, courage, or what-have-you.On its surface, ""The Man"" is the story of how President Dilman, a former university professor and an inconsequential Senator, rightfully claims his office by being more shrewd than the members of his Cabinet and by being man enough to admit his mistakes. (The novel, although written in 1963, seems more truly to be a souvenir of the Eisenhower years.)What is most memorable about the film, however, is not the story, which doesn't make too much sense, but the supremely dopey dialogue, as when Dilman's daughter berates him for not being militant enough: ""You must have conned me with your soft voice and your metaphors!"" And especially the incompetence.When the news of the fatal accident arrives from Germany, no one in the Cabinet seems to know who's in the line of succession. At the end of the movie, President Dilman, having proved his all-American mettle in a nasty confrontation with local blacks, prepares to go onto the convention floor to fight for nomination by his own party (never, of course, identified), as if that were the custom.If ""The Man"" were a better movie, it might possibly be offensive. It isn't. It's silly and innocent, and when the band strikes up ""Hail to the Chief,"" it invites an idiotic tear.Rod Serling, who wrote the story and screenplay, has reworked and recut the original novel as if he were a tailor remodeling an old-fashioned suit to conform with current fashions, and Joseph Sargent, whose direction of ""The Forbin Project"" I admired, has made sure that it's all in focus.In addition to Mr. Jones, who persists in being an interesting actor no matter what, the cast includes a couple of members of Otto Preminger's stock company, Burgess Meredith and Lew Ayres, and some others too nondescript to mention.",1972-07-20T05:00:00+0000

The browning pastures regained some of their green freshness and Bill Hayes permitted himself to hope that his rolling, wooded parklands would be at their best for the 50th annual Du Quoin State Fair.

Leon Gast's ""Our Latin Thing"" has much smaller ambitions and it would generally be fair to say that the film is not so much a documentary as an elaborate, rather free form, production.Almost everybody who receives a credit in ""Our Latin Thing"" is a musician or a disc jockey, and almost all the musicians work for Fania Recordswho seem responsible for the movie and the record and the tape cassettes and the souvenior booklet and the ""Our Latin Thing"" T-shirts that have been appearing around town. Fania sponsored the concertlast August, at Cheetahwhere the principal footage was shot, and what they have now is a fairly? presentable showcase for their stars. These include a lot of people, like Ray Barrotto, the conga player, and Larry Harlow, the pianist, and Johnny Pacheco on the flute, who sound good to me. Some of the songs are very long, up to 16 minutes, and the lyrics, which are not translated, are likely to leave you bewildered if you don't know Spanish.""Our Latin Thing"" does, alas, bill itself as ""revealing the Latin life in N.Y.C."" And to this end it intermittently goes into the community to film domino games, shaved-ice vending, cockfighting and blocks where the city sanitation sweepers seem never to have visited. Some of this material is interesting, much is gratuitous, and all of it seems dedicated to solving the problem of how to alleviate the tedium involved in photographing a musical performance.I don't think that Leon Cast's solutions are very successful  but I don't think that any other director's solutions have been either  and ""Our Latin Thing"" at least avoids the camera and lab tricks so often used to make a group of people playing, or listening or informally dancing to music seem visually important. It is surely valuable to get musicianswhether the Juilliard Quartet, the Rolling Stones or the Fania Records All-Stars  down on film. But it is a specialized value, more limited than a live concert or a great recording. And it is not altogether comfortable in a medium the strengths of which lie elsewhere.""Our Latin Thing"" opened Wednesday at the Cine 2 Theater.",1972-07-21T05:00:00+0000

Show Now a Film,"By now most people must know something about the political vaudeville troupe formed by Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland and others to offer soldiers an alternate entertainment to say, Bob Hope, or whatever shows are provided by the U.S.O. The troupe called itself F.T.A., which stands for Free Theater Associates, or for other things such as, Free the Army.Last year, against considerable official opposition, it toured United States military bases in the Pacific. Francine Parker's ""F.T.A.,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Victoria theaters, is a documentary about aspects of that tour.The film divides its attention pretty evenly between the performers and their audience, and a lot of time is given to interviews with dissident, or merely disillusioned, servicemen. Some hate the war in Vietnam. Some just voice dismay at certain truths about the military like ""They don't want you to be an individual"") that have been perpetually rediscovered by raw recruits at least since the Battle of Thermopylae.So much time is given to the audience, whose insights, though real, are neither original nor profound, that the actual performance comes across in scattered bits and pieces.A lot of the show must have been very funny, with a kind of humor genuinely in touch with the desperation borne of simply being in the service. (Army doctor prescribing to obviously pregnant wife of enlisted man: ""Go home and take two A.P.C. tablets and come back when your swelling goes down."")But as presented in the movie, most of the show doesn't seem very funny, except inadvertentlyas when Donald Sutherland seriously recites the prose of Dalton Trumbo with a straight-from-the-shoulder solemnity that happens to be perfectly in keeping with his phony-preacher characterization in Jules Feiffer's ""Little Murders.""Occasionally the F.T.A. troupe becomes involved with the local population, so that we may hear the Just Grievances Against American Imperialism of the people of Okinawa or Japan or wherever Miss Fonda and her colleagues happen to be listening. I found most of this a predictable bore, but it did allow for the film's only really striking sequence: an anti-American guerrilla theater pageant in the Philippines that momentarily turns revolutionary passion into a romantic gesture of extraordinary beauty.Otherwise there are a few good things. There is the lovely ballad singing of Rita Martinson (most of the singing, by Len Chandler, isn't so lovely), some hints at lively routines, an occasional glimpse of deep happiness in eyes of Miss Fonda or of Holly Near. But the spirit of F.T.A. must lie elsewhere, in other times and special places. For all its agility and pressing close-ups, the film doesn't capture that spiritor even adequately show the kind of experience that might have let it grow.",1972-07-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Japanese Life:'Late Spring' by Ozu Opens at New Yorker,"With the New Yorker Theater's opening yesterday of ""Late Spring,"" five films by the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963) have received commercial release herethe most recent being ""Tokyo Story,"" which played the New Yorker in March and April. After neglecting Ozu for years, we now seem about to embalm his reputation with flattery, with the kind of fulsome praise that makes him sound like this year's Ermanno Olmi, a man to discover, devour, and then forget.The difficulty with Ozu is not in appreciating his films, nor which are always beautifully lucid, nor even in attaching the right film to the right title, though it's somewhat confusing remembering whether ""End of Summer"" is actually ""Early Autumn"" or whether ""Late Spring"" is just another name for ""Early Summer."" The difficulty is in describing an Ozu work in a way that doesn't diminish it, that doesn't reduce it to an inventory of his austere techniques, and that accurately reflects the unsentimental humanism of his discipline.Perhaps the only proper Ozu review would be one from which all adverbs and adjectives had been excisedthey being the prose equivalents to the kind of subjectivism that he so rigorously avoids in his films. Don't ever go to Ozu and expect to participate in someone's nightmare or to share a flashback to a remembered time. We're lucky occasionally to share a view from the window of a moving train, which, in the context of Ozu, is practically an early Cinerama roller-coaster ride.""Late Spring"" was made in 1949, only four years after the end of the war, when General MacArthur was still very much in residence in Tokyo. Yet the only reminders we have of the period are the passing views of a road sign in English and a ""Drink Coca-Cola"" ad. Ozu's concern is middle-class family life seen through relationships that certainly are not removed from great social changes but, rather, not immediately connected to them. Or, more to the point, the great social changes in Ozu are the changes in the family that is his cosmos.In ""Late Spring,"" Ozu's family is an irreducible two, consisting of an aging professor (Chisu Ryu), a wid-owner, and his daughter (Setsuka Hara), a lovely woman in her late 20's who probably would have married some years before if life with her father hadn't been so serene. They are joined from time to time by the professor's practical, bossy sister who believes that everybody, including the professor, should be married.The film is the story of the professor's campaign not to marry his daughter off but to steer her in the direction of a life of her own, which in Ozu's world necessarily means a husband and her own family. The father's ploy: to make her think he wants to marry again.The idea strikes her with horror and disgustfor reasons that Ozu manages to define without tying the girl up in Oedipal knots. In ""Late Spring,"" the collapse of the old civilization and the advent of a new is the girl's acceptance of a suitor (whom we never see), at first grudgingly, then with resigned good humor and finally with something on the order of anticipation, though hardly ecstasy.Ozu's characters don't seek ecstasy, not because they are afraid of it but because they are brave enough to accept compromise, to admit change and to understand, as the daughter does, when the father says: ""Marry him. I'm sure you'll be happyit's not difficult."" Ozu is often called the most Japanese of all Japan's directors, and I suspect that typical of what we find exotic about him is hisodd to our way of thinkingassociation of happiness with difficulty.Chisu Ryu, the grandfather in ""Tokyo Story,"" and Setsuko Hara, who played the widowed daughter-in-law in that film, are immensely affecting  gentle, loving, amused, thinking and feeling beings.I would imagine that acting in an Ozu film might not have been too rewarding for the performers. The director depended as much on camera angle, setting, time of day and time of year as on acting. Yet Ozu's recognition of the wall of skin separating the mind of the character from the viewer is an integral part of his philosophy. It amounts to a profound respect for their privacy, for the mystery of their emotions. Because of thisnot in spite of thishis films, of which ""Late Spring"" is one of the finest, are so moving.",1972-07-22T05:00:00+0000

They are, since absolutely accurate figures in this area will never be available, but this is an old debater's trick to take our minds away from a substantial reality. Mr. Markham attempts to document the notion that the crime rate is not measurably increased by addiction by using an old quotation of Dr. Lawrence Kolb and some dubious statistics to the effect that addiction is secondary to criminal behavior in some cases. These are not the views of anyone who has either experience or eyes in his head to see how the need to raise large sums of money daily by perhaps 100,000 addicts in New York City has turned our city into a place of violence and fear in the past decade. No city can withstand an army of 100,000 turned against it daily to plunder desperately for $50 or $100.",1972-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Wilt deserves a raise because of his great year, said Goldberg in Los Angeles. He hasn't had a raise since he joined the Lakers in 1968 and we certainly think he's entitled to one. His popularity has never been greater. Wilt would rather play basketball, but he doesn't have to do it for a living, especially if he's in an unhappy atmosphere. Goldberg said that Chamberlain, who will be 36 years old on Aug. 21, was prepared to try business enterprises, movies or television if he could not get satisfaction from the Lakers. The lawyer also said that the Lakers signing of Jerry West to a twoyear pact for a reported $500,000 last week had nothing to do with Wilt's bid for more money.

It's an old 16-mm. promotional clip for Marjoe Gortner at the age of 6.Marjoe (a contraction of Mary and Joseph), the son of professional evangelists, began preaching at 3, received ""the infilling of the holy spirit"" at 4, performed marriage ceremonies at 4, first retired from the pulpit at 14, and now, at 28, is retiring again, but with a difference.In ""Marjoe,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II, he's spilling his beans. ""I'm a hype, but I'm not a bad hype,"" says the adult Marjoe, who had been considering one way or another of getting out of the ""Jesus business"" until Howard Smith, The Village Voice columnist, and Sarah Kernochan came along and offered to make a movie about him.""Marjoe,"" filmed last year on location in California, New York, Michigan and Texas, is less a documentary about Marjoe's final weeks on the pentecostal church-and-tent circuit than a feature-length screen test for Marjoe, who apparently hopes for a career in show biz, either as an actor or as a rock star like Mick Jagger, whose dress and mannerisms he so carefully imitates.""Marjoe"" belongs to that genre of new cinema journalism that has produced at least two fine films, Albert and David Maysles's ""Salesman,"" and Robert Kaylor's ""Derby,"" and a lot of others (""King Murray,"" ""A Married Couple"") that fail to elevate the unsolicited confession to the level of something approximating art. No matter how you slice it, it still comes out as self-exploitation of a sort that strikes me as being exceedingly sleazy.Mr. Smith and Miss Kernochan have made a film that stands somewhere between these two poles It's Americana, all right (and so is lynching), but it's often funny and moving in quite surprising ways.It's to the filmmakers' credit that scenes of fervid revival meetings, which follow Marjoe's rather cool explanations of how he operates to excite the crowds and milk them of funds, are less exploitative of the believersof all ages, types and colorsthan of Marjoe himself who, for all his performing dynamism, seems more truly desperate and lost. Imagine wanting to be a rock star!Marjoe talks at length about his career, about how his mother used to hold his head under a faucet if he forgot his lines, about his always being aware that he wasn't ""a miracle child,"" about his lack of belief and wish to make a clean break.""Movie or no movie,"" he says at one point, ""I'd have to get out."" He slips in and out of self-ridicule, laying his hands on the head of his dog and crying out: ""Kill a commie for Jesus!"" Yet he is never a particularly appealing hustler, not because he'swellsmall-time, but because we are aware that the movie is, after all, another hustle.We are also aware that none of the other evangelists who appear in the movie, including Marjoe's father (who, with amazement, describes his son as ""a preaching machine"") have the faintest idea what the movie they're appearing in is up to. They might have objected. At the height of one service, a middle-aged woman collapses in religious ecstasy. The hand of Jesus has been laid upon her and the cameras keep turning for the benefit of Marjoe's career.It's very difficult to separate a movie like this from its subjectperhaps impossible which is why my feelings about it must be as mixed as they are about Marjoe.Where does Marjoe go from here? According to one source, he lives in New York, has an agent, a manager and a lawyer, and hangs out at Max's Kansas City and Elaine's.",1972-07-25T05:00:00+0000

Since he took office in 1934 the Cubs have had only 9, 10 or 11 managers, depending on whether you count Charlie Grimm as one, two or three. (For years Pkil was addicted to alcohol'.

us,Screen: Cryptic Manor,"The night that Evelyn came out of the graveclimbing up from the crypt beneath the ruined chapel beyond the wild ravine in the farthest reaches of the manor parkLord Cumberland completely took leave of his senses. You see, she had been his wife, and possibly she had been unfaithful, and he blamed himself a little for her death. And what with the pressure of his guilt and her guilt, he was having no fun at all with his new wife, Gladysespecially after the ghost of Evelyn began appearing outside bedroom windows, or dressed as a maid dispensing warm milk from the kitchen.But it was Evelyn herself, red hair streaming above her hollow-eyed skull, who had Lord Cumberland thrashing in the mud that rain-drenched night, and who provided the title for Emilio P. Miraglia's new movie, ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.It is a lovely title, in the sense that half a dozen people have asked me if somebody is joking, or if there really is a movie called ""The Night Evelyn . . ."" But I can think of other titles for this movie just as apt. For example: ""The Night Aunt Agnes Was Fed to the Pet Foxes,"" or ""The Night They Buried Alfred Alive."" That last was nobody's fault actually; it's just that when it came time to shovel the dirt over him, the poisonous snake bite on his neck hadn't quite done Alfred in.I've told a bit; perhaps not enough. But certain movie stories, like certain lives, have a classic purity and simplicity that should not be disturbed. So I shall leave the plot of ""Evelyn"" undisturbed, scarcely pausing to mention the day that Cousin George falls into the sulphuric acid-filled swimming pooljust after Gladys kills the mysterious Susan, before herself succumbing to the strychnine in her bottle of champagne.""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" is an Italian-made British horror movie, and despite the incredible English dubbing (Lord Cumberland seems to have inherited the voice of Ronald Colman) it is very much less British than Italian. The men might all have come from a convention of Milanese hair dressers, and the women, coiffed and disrobed to the limits of mid-1960's daring splendor, might have been their clientsor their assistants. When Lord Cumberland drives in the country, he passes rows of stately poplars.

One consequence of the mystery has been a spate, in Norway, of books seeking to defend Quisling's actions.

Frus trated in his desire to interest his countrymen in them, he ac cepted Nazi help.
