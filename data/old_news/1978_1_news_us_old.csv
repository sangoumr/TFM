Jordan also seems willing, but Syria would apparently do nothing more than sign a treaty. The Arabs, of course, say that in return for peace Israel has to give back land taken in 1967 and agree to oemands affecting the Palestinians.

Scarcely 20 years had passed since the appearance of his first books in 1928  the year of both Mr. Pope and Other Poems and Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier yet in those first years after the war Mr. Tate already seemed a venerable survivor of several lost worlds. The Nashville of the Fugitives, the New York of the young Malcolm Cowley and Kenneth Burke and E.E. Cummings, like the Paris of Gertrude Stein and Ford Madox Ford, had receded into the mists of literary legend. As with so much else in those days, the war seemed to have slammed the door shut on what had preceded it. The aspirations and achievements, the lived literary experience of the 20's and the 30's, were suddenly (or so it seemed) transmuted into subjects for the college curriculum.

Only artists like Lewis Hine, Walker Evans and Diane Arbus, who recorded precisely these kinds of subjects, have been allowed into the pantheon of the present generation photographers who, in emulation of this early work, document with relentless dedication America's raw rural landscape, its highways and gas stations, its suburban shopping centers, its mental hospitals, its drug addicts and its derelicts. Increasingly, the content employed by the photoar.tist overlaps with that of the photojournalist. Today the boundaries between documentary and art photography have all but disappeared.

More than two years ago there was published an unusual book of art criticism under the title, The Flow of Art, which consisted of a sizable selection of the essays and reviews of Henry McBride, who died in 1962 at the venerable age of 94. The book, published by Atheneum, was edited, with an introduction, by Daniel Catton Rich, who himself died shortly thereafter, and it also contained an excellent essay about McBride, originally written in 1947, by Lincoln Kirstein. I had intended to write about The Flow of Art at the time of its publication, but circumstances prevented my doing so. Now word has come from M.H.

Young's purpose is not to tell us everything we always wanted to know about the atmosphere (which, in truth, would make a rather short book, largely devoted to weather prediction and control), but to tell us everything we ought to know about the atmosphere. She tells us, for example, about ozone, a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms stuck together. Confusingly, ozone has figured as both hero and villain in recent battles over air pollution. In the upper atmosphere, a layer of ozone gas absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation from the sun; without this natural radiationshield, life on the earth's surface would be impossible. Yet near that surface, a buildup of chemical pollutants can lead to the production of ozone, which is harmful to living beings that come into direct contact with it. If you have trouble understanding why ozone up there is good for you while ozone down here is bad, you willhave even greater trouble understanding why the propellant from our aerosol cans poses a serious threat to the good ozone but not to the bad ozone. Louise Young takes the time to explain why  just as she takes the time to explain how rainstorms form, and exactly what a dew point is, and how the solar wind affects us, and why some scientists think the world is getting dangerously warmer, while others think it is getting dangerously cooler.

us,Film: 'Sasquatch' Roams Northwest:Monster Search,"""SASQUATCH"" is the kind of pseudoscientific silliness that manages to discredit itself entirely, thanks to an approach that might best be labeled simulated-verit. It begins with some hyperbole about Bigfoot, a.k.a. Sasquatch, who would allegedly be the most important anthropological find of our time if anyone could bag him. Then it turns up some ""authentic"" footage of the creature that has been examined and pronounced The Real Thing by ""scientists."" After that, we even see a computer making a composite sketch of Bigfoot, based in part on this very same footage, and are expected to marvel at the similarity between the two images.But the movie then disintegrates into a long and tedious account of an expedition to track the monster through the Pacific Northwest to his lair, and the search-party personnel are so appallingly actorish that they throw any semblance of seriousness to the winds.In addition to Josh, an old mountain man who whistles ""Swanee River"" and is accompanied by his faihful mule, there are also a bumbling cook who is kidded about his culinary skills but is always praised for his coffee. There are a skeptical reporter from New York City, a dog tracker, an Indian guide, ""one of the most distinguished anthropologists in the world,"" and an expedition leader who puffs thoughtfully on his pipe and speaks alternately of the beauty of nature and the gravity of this mission.There is also Sasquatch himself, a pointy-headed fellow in a Kong suit, who is seen throwing papier-Mach boulders a few times and whose presence is often represented by ""Jaws""-type music and rustling branches. Sasquatch isn't on camera long and, of course, he isn't captured. But this expedition, we are told, ""will provide volumes of information to stimulate more-extensive exploration.""Actually, the only interest in the Bigfoot phenomenon that ""Sasquatch"" is likely to generate will be in Hollywood, if by some outlandish fluke the movie becomes a hit. This seems unlikely, unless the market for poorly shot nature footagethe movie is padded with endless shots of furry little scamps twitching playfully for the camerais more sizable than seems possible. Indeed, the animal shots are so repetitive that, when the print at the first show at the Embassy 46th Street Theater inadvertently included two versions of the same reel, it took a benumbed audience quite a while to realize it was watching the same grizzly bear scuffle all over again.",1978-01-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Forum: The Last Days of Allende:Guzman Documentary,"""THE Battle of Chile,"" which opened yesterday at the Film Forum, is an admittedly biased, pro-revolutionary film that raises more questions than it can easily answer. Though it is fabricated of facts, it seems to skirt issues. It is monotonous and long, but it is an important, profoundly disturbing work. It makes one wonder if there is such a thing as a truly revolutionary film form, or if revolution exists only in the eye of the beholder.The film is a three-hour-and-10-minute, two-part documentary on the last months of the democratically elected, pro-Marxist regime of Chilean President Salvador Allende Gossens, who reportedly committed suicide during the right-wing military coup that overturned his Government in September 1973. The film was directed by Patricio Guzmn, a young Chilean, and assembled in Cuba by him and his Chilean associates from some 20 hours of footage smuggled out of Chile after the coup. ""The Battle of Chile"" is not an easy film to watch, not because the events it details are so sorrowful, so inevitable, which they are, but because the film itself is so studiously impersonal.Mr. Guzmn has done nothing less than photograph the conflicting forces of contemporary history and found, when he emerged from the darkroom, that the forces of contemporary history are so faceless there's very little to distinguish one side from the other. The only thing that gives point and direction to ""The Battle of Chile"" is Mr. Guzmn's Marxist interpretation of the events, but this interpretationrelying, as it does, on the age-old conflict between proletariat and bourgeoisie as well as on the exploitation of a poor nation by a rich onedoesn't do full justice to the Chilean tragedy as we know it to be.The country we see in this film looks like a playground for mischievous gods, the result, I suspect, of the director's conscious decision not to appeal to bourgeois sentimentality. The film is virtually one long, unbroken montage composed of scenes of mass demonstrations, either pro- or anti-Allende, of people chanting slogans or marching with banners that contain slogans, of press conferences, of union meetings, of rallies of every description. Everyone is anonymous, even the subject of periodic man-in-the-street interviews.The effect is to depersonalize history to such an extent that even the documented interventions in Chilean internal affairs by agencies of the United States is made to seem remote, a tide of history, something for which no one need take personal responsibility. I doubt that this is the way Mr. Guzmn intended his film to be taken, and, indeed, I doubt that is the film's effect in other parts of the world where simply the mention of the Central Intelligence Agency is enough to cause cold sweats. Revolutionary films cannot be all things to all people.I assume that the filmmakers must regard the late Dr. Allende as some kind of hero, though, because we see him here only as part of an official background, not as a character but as a personage, in newsreels on state occasions, even he remains remote. And because he was not a very imposing man physically, the movie appears to make him a less dynamic, heroic figure than he really was.In ""The Battle of Chile,"" President Allende appears to be a sort of weightless symbol, whether surrounded by aides or as the central figure at mass rallies, where he was adored. His fate, the film seems to say without wanting to, was as much the result of the failure of his supporters to inform and protect him as it was the victory of the enemies who conspired against him.No matter how one reacts to ""The Battle of Chile,"" it is undeniably an epic. It is also depressing in the way it keeps trying to make complex events seem simple. There's a scary moment at a pro-Allende rally where the thou-stands of assembled workers are instructed, ""Jump if you are not a fascist."" Just about everybody starts bobbing up and down on cue, as if that, after all, was what the battle of Chile was all about.The film will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 and repeated there next week, Thursday through Sunday, at the same time.",1978-01-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"New Movie, 'The Duellists,' Is Set During Napoleonic Wars","""The Duellists,"" the first major film to open here this year, may well remain one of the most dazzling visual experiences throughout all of 1978. The movie, set during the Napoleonic Wars, uses its beauty much in the way that other movies use soundtrack music, to set mood, to complement scenes and even to contradict them. Sometimes it's almost too much, yet the camerawork, which is by Frank Tidy, provides the Baroque style by which the movie operates on our senses, making the eccentric drama at first compelling and ultimately breathtaking.""The Duellists,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is an adaptation of a Joseph Conrad story, ""The Duel,"" which I haven't read. It's the first feature film by Ridley Scott, a young English director whose previous experience appears to have been entirely in the making of television commercials (though this doesn't show) and it was written by Gerald Vaughan-Hughes, whose work is also unfamiliar to me. However they collaborated, the result is a film that satisfies not because it sweeps us off our feet, knocks us into the aisles, provides us with visions of infinity or definitions of God, but because it is precise, intelligent, civilized, and because it never for a moment mistakes its narrative purpose.This is to recount the bizarre story of how the life of a young French officer named Armand D'Hubert (Keith Carradine) comes to be dominated by the obsession of a fellow officer, Gabriel Feraud (Harvey Keitel), who believes that D'Hubert has somehow impugned his honor. It begins in Strasbourg in 1801, the year Napoleon comes to power, and continues for the next 15 years, throughout the Emperor's rise, fall and brief comeback as the two men accidentally meet in the course of various campaigns, each meeting culminating in a duel that D'Hubert cannot gracefully deny.Though Feraud is clearly mad, there is no way that D'Hubert can avoid the challenges within the code of honor that defines the professional life of each. At Strasbourg, they fight with sabers, at Augsburg with what looks almost like broadswords. Once they meet on horseback. Another time pistols are the weapons. Every time they meet, each pares a little more off the other. It's as if they were whittling each other down to the bone, though the ending, which is a perfect short-story ending, makes it apparent that Feraud's obsession has had the effect of tempering the spiritual strength of the other man.I assume that it's to the credit of Mr. Scott, the director, that after we once get over the shock of seeing Mr. Keitel and Mr. Carradine in the uniforms of Napoleonic Hussars, we never again see anything anachronistic about these two most contemporary of American actors in such strange surroundings. They are splendid and are never once upstaged by such high-powered English acting talent as Albert Finney, Alan Webb, Robert Stephens, John McEnery, Meg Wynn Owen, Edward Fox and Jenny Runacre, who appear in supporting roles. Cristina Raines, a young American actress (""The Sentinel""), is charming in the small but important part of Mr. Carradine's young wife.What one carries away from the film, though, is a memory of almost indescribable beauty, of landscapes at dawn, of over-crowded, murky interiors, of underlit hallways and brilliantly sunlit gardens. It's not a frivolous prettiness, but an evocation of time and place through images that are virtually tactile, and which give real urgency to this curious tale. It's marvelous.""The Duellists,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a half-dozen duelling scenes of explicitness as well as grace. They are bloody and brutal and absolutely essential to the point of the film.",1978-01-14T05:00:00+0000

And don't think that this sleekness is the result of laziness; it is, on the contrary, the result of longripened plans. Simplicity is not easy. To be truthful, there will be nobility in this house raised against the foliage. And if one climbs one story, it is to . . . the high salon, out of the shadow of the forest and to from that high vantage point the magnificent view of the foliage. And also to see sky. And it leaves the domestics downstairs, near the cellar, garage and street. If the domestics are wellhoused, the house will be well taken care of. Salon, dining room, library, etc. are one single room. Oh, yes! the service core! At the very center. Surely! So that it will serve a good purpose, we are making it with cork bricks which isolate it like a phone booth or a thermos. Funny idea! Not so. It is simply natural service traverses the house from the bottom to the top, like an artery. Where then the rooms themselves? The walls at the end, and those of the core, could encased  with storage cabinets. The boudoir oversees the foliage of the big trees and the space of the summer dining room and two staircases permit one to descend.

For according to Malraux's dictumone that is routinely accepted in most of the other artsthe first certifiably modernist choreographer would not be Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis or Martha Graham, but rather George Balanchine, the man who most people think of as the standard bearer of the classical tradition in 20thcentury ballet.

Homer's description of the love of Paris for Helen is defined within these terms. Helen touches in Paris his capacity for sexual love; once touched, that capacity suddenly realizes itself as a hunger of the soul; expressive life is now given to that which might have remained inchoate forever; the hunger flares up in Paris and burns steadily within him; it is all light and heat of such a high order that it is as though all other forms of love he has ever known become dim and cold in memory; this light and heat are allconsuming; Paris is soon addicted, given over to the hungry need; in time, Helen herself  the object, the cause, the origin of the hungry, burning need  becomes less real than the need itself; the hunger now has a life of its own, a life filled with stubborn power. At this point the nature of the force becomes clear: it is antisocial, fixed on itself, obeying internal laws that conflict with the laws of associativeness.",1978-01-15T05:00:00+0000

In the budget that he will submit next week, President Carter is expected to ask for $126 billion in defense spending, $4 billion less than Secretary of Defense Harold Brown requested, but still 8 percent more than the Pentagon received for the current year.

To a surprising number of Italians, the turn of events seems disturbingly familiar. A stock remark frequently heard these days is: This is 1922 all over again, only this time in red instead of in black.

But, whatever the reason, there has not yet been a compelling or even serviceable movie treatment of the Israeli rescue raid at Entebbe, even though the event had more of a cinematic feeling than most of the stories one finds on the screen.Thus far, there have been two inept and sluggish television movies spun out of the episode; now there is ""Operation Thunderbolt"" at the Guild Theater, a dull and propagandistic Israeli-made feature that is in some ways the least successful version of all.""They look like Arabs! I don't trust them!"" cries a little boy aboard an Air France jetliner, and it turns out he's right to worry about the passengers across the aisle.

""mad-looking German man, played by Klaus Kinsky, who looks even wilder-eyed here than he did in ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God.""The terrorists are seen embracing Arab leaders at a brief stopover, and in Uganda they wind up in telephone contact with Yassir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The tattooed forearm of one passenger, a concentration-camp survivor, is shown in close-up, not once, but twice in a row. When the hostages are divided into Jewish and non-Jewish groups, a little boy cries ""Mommy. Mommy, why aren't they calling us?"" ""Because we're not Jewish, darling."" she replies. ""What's Jewish?"" he wants to know, and because there is no direct reply, the segregation process is allowed to serve as an answer.Even Idi Amin, acted buffoonishly by Mack Heath, is heard to complain about the terrorists' sorting out the passengers. It scares him, he says: ""You'll make the Jews mad, and when the Jews get mad, the whole world gets mad.""There's no reason to expect the movie to deal gingerly with the terrorists. But the real German (played by Mr. Kinsky) was reported to have shown signs of uncertainty and guilt during the ordeal, and the fact that he might have mowed down many of the hostages at the last moment but chose not to lend a not of unexpected humanity to the drama. In the movie, however, the man is nothing more than a cardboard villian, and his death is a real crowd-pleaser. ""Kill him!"" cried one woman, at a preview of the film. ""Scum!"" shouted another.Aside from the fact that it is at times disturbingly inflammatory, ""Operation Thunderbolt"" is objectionable on another score: This is yet another disaster movie that can't manage its mob scenes, There are too many passengers for one director, Menahem Golan, to differentiate gracefuly among them, so he opts for stereotypes and turns the group into an uninterestingly familiar one. Also, the film makers' unwillingness to elaborate on the details of the Israelis' crackerjack strategy robs the event of its most exciting and unexplored aspect.",1978-01-17T05:00:00+0000

Some people in the National Football League believe that the Cowboys always have a 12th man on the field, that Tom Landry provides more of an invisible presence among more of his players than any other coach. Now that Tom Landry has joined Vince Lom bardi, Don Shula, and Chuck Noll as the only coaches with two Super Bowl victories, perhaps he will be appreciated more for what he is than for what he is not. With a face that could not possibly be folded, spindled or mutilated, Tom Landry is not colorful. Instead, he is organized, inventive, decisive and dependable. And perhaps more than anything else, he is consistent. His record proves that. His team has qualified for the playoffs 11 of the last 12 seasons.

This film, which was released in Paris in 1976, comes to us accompanied by high praise from Mr. Truffaut, who, I assume, was acting in his role as old friend and collaborator and not as critic.""The Best Way"" is a very small, very earnest movie that has almost everything going for it except a life of its own. It's nicely acted and intelligently composed, but it has no soul that would give it a particular identity. It has the vacant look of a movie made by someone who wanted to make a movie first and then later cast around for a subject.The chosen subject is the relationship between two young men who are counselors at a boys' summer camp near Paris. Marc (Patrick Dewaere) is a strutting, athletic fellow, while Phillippe (Patrick Bouchitey) is, as they used to say before gay liberation, ""sensitive."" He teaches theater and in the evening he prefers to watch Ingmar Bergman movies on the telly instead of playing poker with the others.One night Marc blunders into Phillippe's room to discover his friend in the full make-up, wig and dress of a drag queen. Instead of telling the others???, Marc simply torments Philippe with the possibility that he might snitch.Mr. Dewaere (the co-star of ""Going Places"") and Mr. Bouchitey have some trouble making their roles work since Mr. Miller, who also wrote the screenplay (with Luc Beraud) appears ???to change the characters at will in the course of the movie. Philippe, we are given to believe, isn't necessarily a homosexual or even a transvestite. He is quite literally, ""sensitive,"" which isn't quite enough to explain the nonsense of his beloved dress. And, of course, it's the revelation of this kind of movie that the macho Marc haswell""tendencies"" toward Phillippe that frighten him.The movie has the air of a 40's problem play recycledthough not very effectivelyfor the 70's. There is, at its center, no problem, only a lot of perfectly capable acting by the two stars and by Claude Pieplu, as the head of the summer camp, and Christine Pascal, as the young woman who loves Philippe, secrets and all.""The Best Way"" is also one of the first movies I've seen in a long time that can't even be convincing in creating a sense of place. This summer camp has less routine than one of those third-rate public schools in the literature of Evelyn Waugh, and it's never anywhere near as funny???.",1978-01-17T05:00:00+0000

President Anwar elSadat of Egypt ordered his Foreign Minister to return home at once from political negotiations in Jerusalem and told President Carter that the talks would resume only if Israel changed jts position. The recall raised serious doubts about the future of the peace initiative that Mr. Sadat began barely two months ago by going to Israel. Later, the Cairo radio reported, Mr. Carter called Mr. Sadat and urged him to reconsider his decision. Mr. Sadat reportedly complained that Israel sought land and not peace, but he agreed to allow military talks to resume in Cairo on Saturday in appreciation of Mr. Carter's efforts on behalf of Middle East peace.

us,The Message From Cairo,"Open diplomacy is often risky, television diplomacy riskier still. President Sadat has had his mind on the omnipresent cameras at every step since his dramatic flight to Jerusalem in November. He knew then that to succeed in suddenly extracting the venom from 30 years of bitterly hostile relations he would have to convince skeptical publics in Israel and the United States of his good faith. But the process of public diplomacy he began generated predictable protestations of virtue from the Israeli side. It may not have been inevitable that the initial expressions of personal admiration and good will would degenerate into pedagogic lectures and expressions of pique, but the risk was nevertheless considerable. The issues that divide Israel from the Arabs are too intractable and the demands of Israeli domestic politics are too confining for Mr. Sadat to have received the sudden and equally dramatic countergestures that he evidently expected and that he felt he needed in order justify his own.",1978-01-19T05:00:00+0000

But while the commissioner deliberates over the recent trade of the 28yearold lefthanded pitcher to the Cincinnati Reds by Charles Q. Finley for $1.75 million and a first baseman named Dave Revering, Vida Blue is equally concerned with the commissinner's annulment of his 1976 sale to the New York Yankees for $1.5 million. The night of that deal, Vida Blue signed a threeyear contract with the A's for a total of $515,000 and a promise from Charles 0. Finley that he would not be dealt Within an hour. Charles 0. Finley sold Vida Blue to the Yankees in a transaction apparently dependent on the signed contract. Because of that alleged fraud by the A's owner, Vida Blue has filed litigation in a California state court that is the forgotten factor of the commissioner's current hearings. If he wins his court case, Vida Blue would be a free agent and his sale to the Reds would be academic.

Senator McGovern reported that Castro was eager to welcome the Yankees, the Carter Administration liked the idea, and the Yankee management was all for it. But not Mr. Kuhn. He concluded that the trip would give the Yankees an unfair advantage over other teams in recruiting Cuban playersif and when such players were allowed to play for pay in this country. So Mr. Kuhn vetoed the Yankee trip and ruled that only an allstar team could play in Cuba. Now he has even broken off negotiations on a proposed allstar game to be held in Cuba in March, His reason: the Cubans are unwilling to give assurances that they will allow their star players to be recruited by our profes sional teams.

us,"'Mado,' a Film On Business And Pleasure","""Mado"" runs two hours and 10 minutes and feels interminable, but it still seems like only half a movie. Director Claude Sautet, a man able to devote his full attention to the tiniest of issues, takes pains to explain those things he shows us, but the movie has no guiding spirit or identifiable raison d'tre. Nothing about it really commands the attention.Mado, (Ottavia Piccolo) the young woman of the title, is sullen and indecipherable, so it's just as well that her importance to the film is relatively slight. She has two groups of acquaintances, working-class kids and older, prosperous businessmen, and we are made to understand that she hires herself out to members of the latter group because members of the former are out of work. Mado only sleeps around enough to support herself, and she doesn't buy anything she doesn't need; also, she doesn't behave this way for pleasure, because she doesn't like anybody. This isn't sex, it's economic reality.One of Mado's well-heeled admirers is Simon. (Michel Piccoli) a wealthy land developer, and it's Simon and his business that most of the film is about. Much of the plot centers around a real-estate deal, and there is a certain amount to be surmised from watching the businessmen's manners and mores. Soon enough, though, the inherent excitement of the real-estate deal begins to pall, and all that remain are vague but somehow familiar observations about the bourgeoisie.Every now and then, Mado reappears to hammer home some comparison between free spirits and captive ones. In one scene, for example, Simon tries to make some coffee but is annoyed to learn that he can't operate his fancy new coffee machine. Then Mado leans over and gives the thing a twist, and it works perfectly. Sacre bleu!The performances by Piccoll, Charles Denner (as one of Mado's beaux) and Romy Schneider (as an alcoholic in love with Piccoli) are unexpectedly moving, especially since one seldom knows why any of these characters is behaving as he or she behaves. Mr. Piccoli's role is terribly ill-defined, but he manages to give a general impression of concern.Mr. Sautet's ending for the film is much more interesting than the slush that precedes it. Mado's two groups of friends begin to resemble one another, and to drift together, until they all wind up making an expedition to look over an important parcel of building lots (for the businessmen) and a ramshackle old farm (for the hippies). Then the party heads home, but a rainstorm and a traffic jam induce them all to leave the main road. They wind up knee-deep in mud in the countryside and it is there that everyone does something or other to reflect his or her true nature. The whole episode has the feeling of a failed Robert Altman movie as seen through a very thick fog.",1978-01-21T05:00:00+0000

A powerful work, The Case Worker seemed blend of the Miller of Tropic of Capricorn, the Celine of Deafh on the Installment Plan, the West of Miss Lonelyhearts and the Sartre Nausea. Its thesis was that our urban culture grows more vacant of humane values in proportion to our power to proceis masses of people through, a machinery designed to give them wellbeing. Because its hero knows that there's limit to what one can suffer (thoughnone to the creation of suffering) he resolves the dilemma by dedicating himself to the insane and idiotic. The idiot child, the ultimate test of The Case Worker, knows nothing of his sacrifice.

us,"'Renaldo and Clara,' Film by Bob Dylan:Rolling Thunder","THERE'S an insolence about ""Renaldo and Clara,"" the four-hour film written and directed by Bob Dylan and featuring members of his Rolling Thunder Revue, that is not easily ignored. Mr. Dylan, who has a way of insinuating that any viewer who doesn't grasp the full richness of his work must be intellectually deficient or guilty of some failure of nerve, has seen fit to produce a film that no one is likely to find altogether comprehensible. Yet for anyone even marginally interested in Mr. Dylanand for anyone willing to accept the idea that his evasiveness, however exasperating, is a crucial aspect of his finest work  ""Renaldo and Clara"" holds the attention at least as effectively as it tries the patience.No knowledge of Mr. Dylan or his history is supposed to be central to an understanding of the film, but it nevertheless trades heavily upon his past. The singer David Blue, playing himself, talks about the artistic climate of Greenwich Village when Mr. Dylan first arrived there, and Joan Baez is rather coyly cast as Mr. Dylan's former lover. Mr. Dylan, even more coyly, is cast as someone other than himself, a very vague figure named Renaldo.As an actor, Mr. Dylan specializes in giving the simultaneous impressions that he isn't really interested in acting, and that he is always acting anyway. Renaldo is thus virtually useless as a character, but his alleged presence in the film does help call attention to Mr. Dylan's obsessive camouflaging of his feelings, a tendency that produces the film's only intelligible conceit. There are only two central characters in the film, a man and a woman, yet their identities are splintered and then parceled out to a dozen different actors.The woman is most frequently played by Sara Dylan, who is now Mr. Dylan's ex-wife, but aspects of her can also be seen in Miss Baez, Ronee Blakley and Helena Kallianiotes. Mr. Dylan, Ronnie Hawkins and Rob Stoner are among the actors who stand in for the man. The two lovers, apparently about to become ex-lovers, are irremediably locked in battle, but the device of fluctuating identities prevents them from ever confronting each other face to face.This technique, not unlike one used by Robert Altman in ""Images,"" is potentially an intriguing one, but Mr. Dylan's love of mystery prevails over his exhibitionism, with disappointing results. Most of the actors here seem to be playing either Mr. or Mrs. Dylan, and all of them slavishly do the director's bidding. But Mr. Dylan's instructiveness, to his actors and to his audience, is incomplete. ""Renaldo and Clara"" is so personal it borders on being obscure, yet it remains surprisingly deficient in personality. The figure who dominates the film is a man in hiding.Mr. Dylan has always been elusive; that's no mean part of his charm. But his best work, like the ""Blood on the Tracks"" album released a couple of years ago, has derived its momentum from alternating currents of passion and restraint, from conflicting impulses to repress and to reveal. ""Renaldo and Clara"" addresses this apparent contradiction so passively, even cold-bloodedly, that it seldom has the urgency it needs. The film is full of connections to be made and riddles to be solved, but it approaches these things so dispassionately that the viewer has little choice but to follow suit.Even though Mr. Dylan makes it clear that he in no way wanted to make a concert film, the footage of him in performance provides not only the film's most electrifying moments but also its most emblematic ones. On the Rolling Thunder tour, Mr. Dylan performed in whiteface, and he is photographed here in tight closeup, singing so ferociously that his sweat melts the makeup; the film's sense of a person at war with a mask is never more riveting than when the camera studies Mr. Dylan's face as he sings. Every detail of these shots is resonant, from the fiery look in Mr. Dylan's eyes to the fresh flowers that someone has apparently been hired to tuck into his hatbrim, just before each show.The film contains more than its share of dead weight, but it is seldom genuinely dull. On the credit side, there are a great many isolated images that have an independent vitality, from the sight of Joan Baez, looking unexpectedly dreamy in a white gown, to the spectacle of Allen Ginsberg, introduced as ""without a doubt a very interesting and clever personality,"" reading his poetry to a bewildered band of middle-aged ladies.It's a pity that the editing of the film, which is credited to Mr. Dylan and Howard Alk, pays so little heed to consistency. Following a pattern of linear thought is clearly not one of the film's concerns, but maintaining a constant degree of intensity should have been; this way, by carelessly commingling very complex and suggestive episodes with very flat and simple ones, the editing continually throws an already befuddled viewer even further off balance. Interludes like the culminating meeting of Mr. Dylan, Mrs. Dylan and Miss Baez, at once quite rarefied and in an atmosphere that is amusingly mundane, and an exceedingly one-note segment devoted to Hurricane Carter, are so incompatible that they simply don't belong in the same movie.",1978-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Slouching Toward Berlin:Made in Exile,"BERLIN, NOV. 3-11, is a city without sunlight. Mostly it rains. It snows occasionally but it's the kind of snow that is already gray by the time it reaches the cobblestones. Everything is damp, chilled. No winter coats anywhere. People cling to one another for warmth, but there is none. In effect, life is over in Ingmar Bergman's new film, ""The Serpent's Egg."" What we witness are involuntary twitches, the glazing of eyeballsthe onset of rigor mortis.""The Serpent's Egg"" is the darkest, most barren Bergman film since ""Shame,"" and the windiest, most banal since ""The Touch,"" full of dark portents that he treats as if they were his privileged information, as if they hadn't been in the public domain for nearly four decades. The film, which opens today at the Coronet, is dispossessed Bergman, Bergman in exile from his native Sweden whose serene political-social landscape has always highlighted the particular terrors of Bergman characters.""The Serpent's Egg"" is the first film to be made by Bergman after he voluntarily left Sweden to take up residence in Germany following his brush with the Swedish authorities. This information may not be relevant, but it might help to explain the peculiar sense of dislocation within his English-language screenplay, a melodrama that never quite makes any connection to the characters within it.The film, which takes place in Berlin in the week in 1923 when Hitler failed in his first attempt to take power, has the form of a mystery and some of the elements of rudimentary science-fiction, though, with hindsight, we (and Bergman) know it to be science-fact.The two principal characters are Abel Rosenberg (David Carradine), an American trapeze artist stranded in Berlin after his partner-brother has had a minor accident, and Abel's sister-in-law, Manuela (Liv Ullmann), who is separated from Abel's brother. In the film's opening sequence Abel returns to his hotel room to find that his brother has committed suicide for no apparent reason, leaving behind a barely legible note warning of people ""being poisoned.""In the succeeding days, Abel, who is a somewhat more mysterious character than Bergman may have intended, appears on the edge of an hysteria that has its origins in events that occurred before the start of the movie, as well as in the current events he participates in. Manuela, so beautiful and sweet-natured that we wonder why she and her late husband split up, sings and dances in a sleazy cabaret by night and works from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. several days a week in a whorehouse.While the city is apparently coming apart through apathy and inflation, Abel is losing his grip on reality. One morning he is picked up by a friendly, though menacing, police inspector (Gert Froebe) who suspects him of being implicated in his brother's death as well as in the unexplained deaths of a half-dozen other people he has known. Is Abel going out of his mind? If you know your standard mystery movie, you know he is not, but the explanations that Bergman finally gives us aren't worthy of the mysteries he has tantalized us with.It is Bergman's point that Abel and Manuela, in this week in which they attempt to survive in Berlin, witness the ""nesting"" of the serpent's egg, the embryo that 10 years later will hatch Hitler, the Nazis, the holocaust, World War II and all the evils we know eventually to have come forth.The audience, unfortunately, is way ahead of the movie's political forecast, which might not be fatal if Bergman's characters provided any particular insights, or interest. They don't.As played by Mr. Carradine, Abel Rosenberg is a wounded creature even before his brother's suicide. He may be surprised to experience anti-Semitism for the first time, but his surprise isn't enough to give the experience dramatic weight in the film.Miss Ullmann's Manuela is an extremely ladylike cabaret singer and part-time whore, and there is something perfunctory about the jazzy cabaret sequences shot in lewd colors and featuring performers in bizarre costumes and makeup. Decadence of this sort is the easiest thing in the world to capture on film, second only to the kind of suspense that can be generated by a horse race in a movieany movie.Bergman's villain, a mad scientist played by Heinz Bennent, is a B-movie creature. He's so rotten he almost seems to be an old friend, though he talks rather better than most villains as he describes the terrible things that will soon come to pass.Is this all there is to ""The Serpent's Egg?"" it seems to be, but there are indications that despair is really the film's theme, though this despair is made compelling on only a couple of occasions. The opening of the film with the brother's suicide is one of the most sorrowful sequences Bergman has ever done. There's also a fine, ghoulish sequence in which the drunken Abel breaks the window of a Berlin bakery shop, as if to make himself the object of the wrath that German Jews feel toward all Nazis.Mostly, ""The Serpent's Egg"" is a movie of beautifully photographed weather and handsome period sets and costumes that encase characters who remain as anonymous as the bodies in a morgue. It's dead.",1978-01-27T05:00:00+0000

He revered Seurat, and one of the primary ambitions of his art was to achieve a pure formalism, based on color, akin to the French master's.

us,New Lina Wertmuller Movie:Her First in English,"""THE END of the World in Our Usual Bed in a Night Full of Rain,"" the title of Lina Wertmuller's new film, her first in English, is more or less a pictograph of a movie that uses too many words to say very little, at least very little that hasn't been said before with more wit and ebullience, often by the Italian director herself.The subject is once again sex and politics, which in ""The Seduction of Mimi"" and ""Swept Away,"" two of Miss Wertmuller's funniest films, erupted all over the place as the natural consequences of ordinarythough far from commonplaceheterosexual relations.In Miss Wertmuller's little red book, men are capitalists and women the proletariats. Sex is a projection of the class struggle and romantic love is the foundation for an economic system that creates co-conspirators of masters and slaves, of lovers and those loved. What has made her films so surprising and moving and comic, perhaps even counterrevolutionary, until now, is the peculiar way in which contradictory class roles can become hilariously and naturally confused within a single character.The Communist deckhand in ""Swept Away,"" the fellow played by Giancarlo Giannini, is as outrageously self-interested as a 19th-century railroad baron once he takes command of his woman on a desert island. The title character in ""The Seduction of Mimi,"" another Communist played by Mr. Giannini, is seduced, abandoned and seduced again by love. The most appealing Wertmuller characters are earnest, sincere, sometimes none-too-bright, full of awareness about others and absolutely blind about themselves.This gult is what makes them figures of essential comedy. Pasqualino (Mr. Giannini), the third-rate Neapolitan hood who chooses survival above honor in ""Seven Beauties,"" is comic not because of what he does, but because of the great value he puts on things the rest of us have been taught are worthless. We don't feel superior to him. We can recognize similar patterns in ourselves.Unfortunately, there are no surprises, no feelings of recognition, no real contradictions at work in ""The End of the World,"" which opened yesterday at Loews Tower East and which Miss Wertmuller apparently considers her most political film. That may be, though I doubt that any movie as essentially lifeless as this one can be political in the sense that it might move one to specific action.""The End of the World"" is about Paolo (Mr. Giannini), a Communist journalist, a thinking male chauvinist, and his American wife, Lizzy (Candice Bergen), a feminist and a professional photographer, whose marriage is coming apart in the course of the film for reasons that could surprise only someone who's been out of the universe for the last 20 years.The setting is a magnificent Roman apartment on a rainy night that, through hints that march through the movie like painted elephants, could be the beginning of Armageddon. A television commentator speaks ominously of floods that are without precedent, of an upper atmosphere that's been worn out through air pollution down below.Lizzy represents not only liberated woman, but also the entire New World, which hasn't realized its potential. Paolo is the Old World intellectual who recognizes his defects and is powerless to correct them. Lizzy and Paolo aren't people. They are personalized shopping carts overloaded with large, economy-sized, precooked ideas.In a series of flashbacks, Miss Wertmuller fills us in on the meeting, courtship and marriage of Lizzy and Paolo, a series of scenes that becomes increasingly humorless as we approach the present night and its anticlimaxwhen Lizzy accuses Paolo of making love as if he were taking a walk before going to sleep. In his turn, Paolo accuses Lizzy of wanting to abandon the home. He: ""You blame me for what you haven't done."" she: ""You're rightthat's why I have to go.""""The End of the World"" is virtually a two-character movie, though there's a hideous chorus made up of Lizzy and Paolo's friends who appear from time to time to make facetious comments about the married couple.The movie isn't witty and it's seldom funny, partly because Lizzy and Paolo are forever saying things Miss Wertmuller seems to agree with, but Miss Wertmuller is not Shaw. As a political philosopher, she'd be great at a cocktail party. There are no self-delusions in the characters. We are meant to attend to their clichs as if hearing them for the first time. There's nothing to discover in this movie, which hasn't evolved as a human comedy, from its characters, but from points of view for which characters have been created.Miss Bergen's is the least attractive, since the dialogue Miss Wertmuller has given her leans heavily on desperate sarcasm. Most of the time Mr. Giannini replays his familiar Italian male-chauvinist-pig character, which doesn't quite fit here because he is supposed to be an intelligent, knowing man. Neither actor is helped by Miss Wertmuller's addiction to tight close-ups that have the effect of exposing the film's emptiness.There is one very funny sequence near the beginning of the film, when Lizzy makes a shambles of a solemn religious procession by coming to the aid of a woman who's being beaten up by a boyfriend, but the rest of the movie is made tolerable only by the sets, including a beautiful 14th-century monastery and the huge, old-fashioned apartment where Lizzy and Paolo live. ""The End of the World"" appears not to have been written and directed, but furnished by a classy interior decorator.",1978-01-30T05:00:00+0000
