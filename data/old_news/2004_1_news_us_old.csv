A hospital employee phoned the agency in May 1998 to report that the father, Allen Lamont James, did not get his then 6-week-old son, Alquan White, proper care before bringing him to the hospital for mild pneumonia, according to an agency statement. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the department said no reports of abuse or neglect were associated with Alquan White at the time when Rhode Island child welfare authorities, investigating a matter related to Alquan's out-of-state siblings, asked their Connecticut counterpart to determine his whereabouts in 2001. A Connecticut social worker never saw the boy and relied on a report from Mr. James's lawyer that the child was fine. The state medical examiner determined this week that Alquan died from blunt trauma. Mr. James, 38, was charged with capital felony murder in his son's death and is being held in $1.25 million bond.

Parents push bundled-up babies across the ice in sleighs; and French- and English- speaking vendors sell hot chocolate at warming huts and fire pits. This is the winter scene in Ottawa, Canada's capital, an uncommonly civilized city of about 800,000. Frequent blizzards give way to crisp, sunny skies, the neo-Gothic Parliament Buildings rise majestically on a limestone escarpment above the Ottawa River, and the rolling Gatineau Hills crease the northwest skyline. Ottawa has undergone a transformation in recent years, caused in part by an influx of high-tech companies: there are still 39 museums, scarlet-clad Mounties and about 120 foreign embassies, but the city now boasts the highest percentage of Internet-connected households in Canada and enough good restaurants to satisfy the most demanding foodie.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Inventor of the Wraparound,"A Parisian court of appeals ruled in 1934 that a woman's hat was a work of art worthy of copyright protection. In the lavishly illustrated SHOCKING! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli (Philadelphia Museum of Art/ Yale University, $65), Dilys E. Blum, the curator of costume and textiles at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, persuasively argues that Schiaparelli was an artist no less than a designer -- and not only because of her collaborations with Dal, Cocteau and Man Ray. Her Spanish rival, Balenciaga, considered Schiaparelli ''the only real artist in the couture.'' From the presentation of her first collection in 1927 to the closing of her salon in 1954, the Italian-born designer ''was quick to adapt to new trends and seemingly fearless when it came to trying new things.'' The perpetually innovative Schiaparelli introduced a multitude of items now taken for granted in fashion. She invented the wraparound dress, designed fashion eyewear, created the first designer boutique and made fashionable the use of synthetic fabrics, like rayon. By 1932, she had 400 employees producing 7,000 to 8,000 garments a year in eight different ateliers. But World War II would prove devastating to her empire: in October 1940, Schiaparelli was compelled to reduce her workforce to 150. Along with Blum's informative chapters, the captions for several hundred illustrations include interesting tidbits of their own; for example, that in lieu of journeying to Paris for her fittings, Mae West sent a plaster cast of her figure.

Though she and Julia Roberts both got noticed in the same film (''Mystic Pizza,'' 1988), Ms. Taylor quickly slipped into the lower-profile world of independent film, where her career arc soon became the left-handed image of her co-star's. She played the title dog in ''Dogfight'' and the ''I'' in ''I Shot Andy Warhol''; Abel Ferrara gave her the role of a vampire in ''The Addiction,'' Robert Altman recruited her for ''Short Cuts'' and ''Prt  Porter,'' and most recently the creators of ''Six Feet Under'' cast her as Lisa in their HBO series. Throughout her 15 years in film, however, Ms. Taylor never lost touch with the theater, and she is currently appearing in a revival by the New Group of Wallace Shawn's 1985 play ''Aunt Dan and Lemon'' at the Clurman Theater on Theater Row. Her serene performance as an impressionable -- and ultimately corrupted -- shut-in is winning her the stage notices of her career.

During the 1980's and '90's, he sang in choirs under the direction of Dr. Dennis Keene, conductor, performing at Lincoln Center in Alice Tully Hall. He also sang in the Point O'Woods Church Choir on Fire Island, under Dr. Mary Monroe, choir director, which gave him great joy. The date of a Memorial Service will be announced shortly.

But for those who didn't experience the prime of George Balanchine and his New York City Ballet, Ms. Nichols -- with her luminous phrasing, regal presence and generous free spirit -- makes everything O.K. Though she is a mother of two, it is difficult to imagine she ever danced better than she does now. A native of Berkeley, Calif., she trained with her mother, Sally Streets, a member of the company in the 50's, before becoming an apprentice with City Ballet in 1974 and a principal in 1979. Now, just as the world is celebrating the centenary of Balanchine's birth, New Yorkers can honor Ms. Nichols, who will be dancing in several principal roles. In a recent conversation with Gia Kourlas at the company's headquarters at the Rose Building in Lincoln Center, she discussed age, dance after childbirth and the years she spent with Mr. B.",2004-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Last year in the Book Review, Geoffrey Moorhouse found this ''the sort of book that fires the armchair traveler with a desire to follow in its author's footsteps, not just because it is passionate about its subject and immensely well informed about the Inca empire . . . but also because it tells of some quite heroic exploration by Thomson himself, on foot in one of the most intractable parts of the earth.''",2004-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Thomas Edward Sasso, 51, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, died on January 1, 2004, in Westchester, New York, of injuries sustained in an automobile accident on the afternoon of Monday, December 29. He is survived by his cherished wife, Kate Quackenbush Sasso and beloved daughter, Allison Quackenbush Sasso; his loving parents, Thomas A. and Felicia Lettieri Sasso of Teaneck, his loving sister, Diane F. Sasso, and devoted brother-in-law, George Karelitsky, of Ridgewood; nieces Elizabeth Sasso-Karelitsky, Susan A. Martin, and Sarah Bruno; nephews Noah and Alexander Sasso-Karelitsky, and Samuel F. Martin; parents-inlaw R. Donald and Audrey Gordon Quackenbush; sisters and brothers-in-law, Susan Q. and John A. Martin and Lynn Q. and Robert Bruno, and more best friends than one can imagine. He was a proud graduate of St. Peter's Preparatory, Class of 1970, and of Boston College, Class of 1974. Even as a youth, Tom was a natural leader and drew people to him with a great passion for life. President of the Real Estate Lenders' Association of New York and a well known professional in commercial real estate, Tom was recognized as both a knowledgeable competitor and valuable partner. He began his career with Chemical Bank, later joining the Chase Manhattan Bank and subsequently GE Capital, where he served as Senior Vice President. Tom was an expert backgammon player, an enthusiastic sailor, and the winner of an award for golfing. Having survived major cancer surgery in 2000, he was downhill skiing within six months and proudly completed the Ridgewood Memorial Day Run within a year. Tommy supported many charitable organizations. He was a populist, a humanist, a gentleman with a passion for justice and peace. He invited divergent views and encouraged debate. He had an uncommon generosity, always lending a hand and encouraging others to give of themselves. Tommy was a treasure to all of us. He will be terribly missed. For visitation information, contact Feeney's Funeral Home, Ridgewood, New Jersey, 201444-7650. A celebration of Tom's life and a special Mass will be held on Wednesday, January 7, 10:45 AM, at Mt.

He began moonlighting at Mattel Toys, and eventually, over a 30 year career, became Vice President of several divisions. With Mattel, he opened factories in Asia and Europe and was instrumental in the early production of classic toys including Barbie and Hot Wheels. Mr. Adler also founded numerous business ventures including toymaker Leonis, and a real estate concern, Adler Investment Company. He loved working and never fully retired. At home, Mr. Adler enjoyed keeping house and garden in meticulous condition and had a great passion for music, especially opera. More than anything, he enjoyed spending time with his family, and especially his wife, the love of his life. He kept an active mind to the end, always ready with an appropriate quotation, and continuing to read books and newspapers voraciously. A memorial service to celebrate his life will be held at 12 noon, on Tuesday, Janaury 6, 2004, at the Adler residence in Los Angeles. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the American Cancer Society. Inquiries to Transitions Funeral Service, 800-869-7984.",2004-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Tian wasn't the first Jaffords determined to make something of the twenty acres behind the home place; his Gran-pere, perfectly sane in most other respects, had been convinced there was gold there. Tian's Ma had been equally positive it would grow porin, a spice of great worth. Tian's particular insanity was madrigal. Of course madrigal would grow in Son of a Bitch. Must grow there. He'd gotten hold of a thousand seeds (and a dear penny they had cost him) that were now hidden beneath the floorboards of his bedroom. All that remained before planting next year was to break ground in Son of a Bitch. This chore was easier spoken of than accomplished. ",2004-01-04T05:00:00+0000

The children, family and friends of Mrs. Bernice (Basie) Glaser Miller were saddened to learn of her passing on December 30, 2003, at the age of 89. Basie was the adoring wife of William, an attorney in Princeton, NJ, from 1939 until his death in 1977, and then of Ralph Porges, from 1984 until 1998. For the past five years, she had enjoyed an active life at Orchard Cove in Canton, MA. She loved her sister and brother-in-law, Selma and Samuel Reiner of New York City, her brother, the late Sidney Glaser, and his wife, Martha of Boynton Beach, FL, and her cousins Barbara and Howard Malloy of Stamford, CT, and Betty Young of Rumson, NJ. Basie graduated from New York University and then received her master's degree from Columbia University in New York. She married William and they moved to Princeton, NJ, in 1939. Basie had a very productive life in Princeton and enthusiastically engrossed herself in community activities. She taught speech and drama at Princeton High School, was President of the League of Women Voters, was an elected member of the Princeton Board of Education, a Vice President of the Princeton Chapter of Deborah Hospital, one of the founders of the Jewish Center of Princeton, and Director of the Princeton United Jewish Appeal. Basie was also instrumental in the construction of the John Witherspoon Middle School in Princeton Borough, and she was a tireless worker on behalf of consolidation for Princeton Borough and Township. But her social and civic contributions paled in comparison to her roles as a Mother, Grandmother and Great-Grandmother. Her children (Susan and Steven Sewall of Lincoln, MA; Fred and Lee Miller of Louisville, KY; and Lowell Miller and Gail Bradney of Woodstock, NY), grandchildren (Kimberly Sachs, Derek Sewall, Tara Rozen, Jessica Rath and Finn Alvaro), nieces (Louise Gutheil, Nancy Ingram, Janet Taxin and Irene Margulies), and six great-grandchildren will always be influenced by her intense motivation to always ''do the right thing.'' Her axioms on behavior, enthusiasm for life, social consciousness, sense of fairness and belief in the importance of good nutrition and exercise will be forever engrained on subsequent generations of family that follow her. Her last words to her three children were, ''Remember to eat your breakfast.'' Contributions in her memory may be made to the Jewish Center of Princeton, 435 Nassau St, Princeton, NJ 08542.

The Bush administration's health regulators announced last week that they would soon ban ephedra, an herbal supplement used to promote weight loss and increase energy, on the grounds that it poses ''an unreasonable risk of illness or injury.'' That was the only sensible response to mounting evidence that ephedra has been harming thousands of Americans. Yet the tortuous course of this regulatory crackdown underscores the dangerous weakness of a 1994 law that allows the supplement industry to market products whose safety and effectiveness have never been proved while making it extremely hard for health regulators to take them off the market if evidence of harm subsequently emerges.",2004-01-05T05:00:00+0000

Several times a year, she was given hormones that caused her to super-ovulate -- to release many eggs instead of one. These were flushed from her, fertilized and implanted in receptor cows as near as the next stone paddock or as far away as China and Japan. The reason was Bell Paula's milking record. At the time, an average Holstein in America -- the ubiquitous black-and-white dairy cow -- gave some 16,000 pounds of milk a year.

He led the first double blind clinical trial of levodopa, the standard treatment for the disease.

The Legislature, which established the goals, had sought to reduce new AIDS cases to 30 per 100,000 people, but the rate reached almost 31 cases.

The corporation tax has brought in less revenue than was expected, partly because taxpayers are unaware of the increases enacted last year. ''So far, the corporate tax receipts have been substantially lower than estimated,'' Ms. Wyman said.

A federal appeals court panel reduced his sentence to life. The death sentence was reinstated by the full court when the state appealed; and the Supreme Court declined to review the case last month. The execution of Karl D. Roberts, 35, convicted of murdering his 12-year-old niece in 1999, was stayed.

''Public policy favors reintegrating ex-offenders into society, including making them full participants in civic life. We don't believe the state has any justification in denying these people the right to vote.'' The suit contends that denial of voting rights to those on probation or parole violates the New Jersey Constitution's provisions guaranteeing equal protection under the law.",2004-01-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Telecommunications: Nortel Shares Surge On Verizon Venture,"Shares of the Nortel Networks Corporation, North America's largest maker of telephone equipment, rose 19 percent yesterday after Verizon Communications selected Nortel to provide equipment for Internet-based phone calls. The companies agreed to initial terms of a contract and expect to sign a five-year agreement on converting Verizon's network with new packet switches and other Web-calling gear in the next few months, they said. A Verizon spokesman, Mark Marchand, would not say how much the contract was worth. Nortel expects to report a profit for 2003 after net losses of more than $35 billion in the preceding five years. Nortel is winning orders as carriers upgrade networks with packet-switching technology, which compresses voice and data traffic so it can be sent together over high-speed lines. Shares of Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, rose 92 cents, to $5.68. The shares are down from a high of $89 in July 2000. Verizon shares rose 8 cents, to $36.56.",2004-01-08T05:00:00+0000

''In Aspen, everyone is always very casual,'' said Greg Poschman, a local filmmaker who grew up here. ''In the old days, if you saw someone wearing a suit, they were either D.E.A. -- drug enforcement -- I.R.S. or a Jehovah's Witness. Since then, Aspen has become chic and trendy but the casualness remains.'' LOIS SMITH BRADY",2004-01-09T05:00:00+0000

It is with the deepest regret that we mourn the passing on December 25, 2003 of a poet, editor, teacher, essayist and Jewish feminist whose life and work was a paradigm of character, courage and compassion. She received her baccalaureate from Towson State College, Maryland, her Master's from City College of New York, and her Ph.D from Rutgers University. As a teacher she was revered by her students for her concern and sensitivity. As a poet her work was widely published and anthologized, and her readings well-received and attended. She was considered by several national critics to be one of the ten best Jewish poets in America and was a runner-up for Poet Laureate of Brooklyn. Her last national featured reading was in Ann Arbor, Michigan; her last tristate reading was at Poets and Teachers in Union Square, Manhattan. Her work combined nostalgia and humor with poignancy and purpose. Her early work featured characters such as Lilith, Superwoman and Vilda Chaya, a wild woman who sought counsel from cats and plants even as she climbed down the economic ladder. Enid Dame inherited her political activism and a desire for justice and truth from her parents, the late Morton and Bernice Jacobs. She is survived by her husband, Donald Lev, with whom she founded Home Planet News, which recently celebrated its 25th year of publication. All who knew Enid loved her for her grace, charm, humor and intelligence. She was always glad to meet friends and always went out of her way to support them.

Their release this week is likely to bring more discouraging news: The trade gap is expected to reach a record high for 2003. Last month, the figures climbed to $41.8 billion, or more than 5 percent of the gross domestic product. Last week, the Labor Department announced another gloomy figure: the economy added only 1,000 jobs last month, far fewer than needed to absorb those who want to work. With corporations continuing to export jobs to China and India, the trade deficit and globalization may be issues to watch this election year. ",2004-01-11T05:00:00+0000

But to my ear Malian music is still removed from the blues. The fingerpicking cross-rhythms are there, but music that was originally plucked on kora (harp) and tapped on balafon (marimba) doesn't have the bent notes -- the blue notes -- of American blues, and West African lyrics tend to speak for a community's conscience rather than individual travails. So don't listen to ''Foly!'' (World Village), the live album by Habib Koit and his band Bamada, for blues connections. Enjoy it instead for Mr. Koit's kindly, heartfelt singing, for the weightless patterns he shares with the band, for an easy cosmopolitanism that touches on rumba and rapping, and for songs that are free of studio gimmickry and time limits.

us,Pining for Pinochet,"Roberto Bolano's novel BY NIGHT IN CHILE (New Directions, paper, $13.95) relates -- in one long, masterfully sinuous paragraph punctuated by a one-sentence finale -- the deathbed memories of the Rev. Sebastin Urrutia Lacroix, a literary critic and Jesuit priest. We learn of his mentoring by a right-wing critic at whose estate Father Urrutia encounters Pablo Neruda; his trip to Europe to visit churches whose priests are more interested in falconry than religious practice; his being called on to give lessons in Marxism to the leaders of Chile's military regime, General Pinochet among them. Pinochet is shown indulging in petty one-upmanship, comparing himself to the leaders of the recently overthrown government. (''I'm always reading and writing. All the time. Which is more than you could say for Allende or Frei or Alessandri, isn't it?'') Father Urrutia's final recollection is of Pinochet-era literary gatherings at the home of a local writer and her American husband (transparently based on the former ambassador Orlando Letelier's assassin and the assassin's wife), in whose basement the regime tortures dissidents. Postwar Chilean politics and literature infuse this densely learned, richly evocative novel. In Chris Andrews's lucid translation, Bolano's febrile narrative tack and occasional surreal touches bring to mind the classics of Latin American magic realism; his cerebral protagonist and nonfiction borrowings are reminiscent of Thomas Bernhard and W. G. Sebald. The novel, Bolano's first to be translated into English, is at once occasion for celebration and for mourning. The author, a native of Chile, died of liver failure in July at 50. Of some consolation is a substantial body of work still to be translated. Mark Kamine",2004-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   PRYSTOWSKY, ROSE, M.D.","PRYSTOWSKY--Rose, M.D. Advocate for women, psychiatrist, devoted wife and mother. Rose Prystowsky, M.D., passed away on January 7, 2003, as a result of a fire that engulfed her home in Nutley, New Jersey. She was 82 years old. Dr. Prystowsky was born Rose Poliakoff, the youngest of seven children, in Anderson, South Carolina on November 12, 1921. Her father having died when Rose was 3 years old, she was raised by her mother and siblings. She attended the University of South Carolina where she was graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1941, and was the only woman in her class of 48 at the Medical College of South Carolina where she received her MD with honors in 1944. While in her second year of medical school, she married classmate Milton Prystowsky, MD, and their first son was born shortly after graduation. She completed an internship at Kings County Hospital, Brooklyn, in 1945. When her husband was called to military service, Dr. Prystowsky put her residency on-hold. Instead of juggling patients, she found herself caring for the couples two young boys while both working in a research lab and pursuing a Masters of Public Health from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, a degree she received in 1951. During an era in which a woman pursuing a professional career, a healthy marriage, and a rich family life simultaneously was considered by most an impossible goal, Dr. Prystowsky successfully balanced all three objectives. In 1961, having had three more sons in the intervening years, Dr. Prystowsky returned to her medical career as a resident, and then chief resident, in Psychiatry, at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. After completing her residency and a Fellowship in Child Psychiatry also at Mount Sinai, Dr. Prystowsky established a private practice in Nutley, New Jersey in 1965. She was board-certified in 1970 and became a Fellow in the American Psychiatric Association in 1973. While maintaining her private practice for more than 25 years, Dr. Prystowsky made professional contributions that extended far beyond the walls of her office. Between 1965 and 1985, for instance, she served as a part-time child psychiatrist for the Family Service and Child Guidance Clinic, an organization dedicated to serving the needs of children and families in the communities of the Oranges, Maplewood, and MillburnShort Hills, New Jersey. During her twenty years of service at the clinic, Dr. Prystowsky lectured to lay groups on mental health topics and educated public health nurses on the treatment of patients with emotional problems among many other projects. She was also an active teacher in academic settings. At the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, she supervised medical students in their child psychiatry elective and helped to train child psychiatry residents one to two days a week for many years. An active member of numerous medical and psychiatric societies throughout her career, Dr. Prystowsky served as president of the New Jersey Psychiatric Association (NJPA) from 1990 to 1991. Previously, as chair of the NJPA's Committee on Women, Dr. Prystowsky had overseen a two-year investigation into the adverse impacts of workplace harassment and discrimination against women, especially against women physicians. Then, in 1990, she moderated a meeting entitled ''Harassment and Discrimination of Women Physicians and Strategic Coping Tech niques.'' A direct outgrowth of the work Dr. Prystowsky had guided, the meeting brought together multiple professional medical organizations to consider the issues. In 1996, the NJPA recognized Dr. Prystowsky with its Golden Merit Award. ''Rose's resume as a teacher, researcher, clinician, leader, and organizer reads for many pages,'' the award's presenter acknowledged before concluding, on a more personal note, that ''everyone in this organization knows Dr. Rose Prystowsky as someone who can be depended upon.'' Dr. Prystowsky retired in the late 1990's as a result of deteriorating health. She is survived by her husband, Milton Prystowsky, MD, her 5 sons, Stephen Prystowsky, MD, of New York City, Eric Prystowsky, MD of Indianapolis, Michael Prystowsky, MD, PhD of Harrison, NY, Barry Prystowsky, MD of West Orange, NJ, and Richard Prystowsky, Ph.D. of Arcata, CA, as well as by 14 grandchildren.

The beloved mother of Constance Nyatta and her husband Mwasi of Nairobi, Kenya and Joan Turnbull Carl and her husband Bernard of Washington, D.C, died peacefully in her home in Washington. Her daughter Joan and her granddaughters Alexandra Turnbull Carl and Jennifer Turnbull Carl were by her side. In addition to Alex and Jennifer, Mary left behind three other grandchildren, Joan's son Andrew Mackie Turnbull Carl and Connie's children Inosi Kiara and her husband Gitonga, and Mwashuma Nyatta. She is also survived by her sister Margaret Patch Upton. Mary was born in Beirut, Lebanon, on March 7, 1914. She was the fifth child of a Scottish mother, Caroline McDuff Mackie, and an American father, James Alfred Patch. Her grandfather was a Presbyterian missionary from Aberdeen and her father, the head of Beirut's American University Chemistry Department, was a friend and colleague of T.E. Lawrence (''Lawrence of Arabia'') during the tumultuous years of World War I in the Middle East. While she was still a child, Mary's family returned to Stoneham, Massachusetts, where her father and uncle ran the Patch Pharmaceutical Company. Mary graduated from Wheaton College in 1935 and received further degrees in Occupational Therapy in Boston and at Columbia University in New York. Mary's marriage to Fred Leroy Turnbull ended in divorce, but the two remained soul mates until her death. Mary's family and friends called her Nana, and admired her New England traits of honesty, courage, simple elegance and generosity of spirit. Her passions were her family and her garden. She delighted equally in the stories her grandchildren shared around the dining room table and in the feel and smell of the earth, where, for her, joy flowed from every flower and tree. Nana's inexhaustible energy for life, for learning, for caring and for bringing peace and comfort and beauty into the lives of her family and friends, remain her legacy. Services will be held in the Bethlehem Chapel at Washington National Cathedral, Washington D.C. on Monday, January 12, 2004 at 4 p.m. The family is planning a further remembrance over the summer in Nana's garden in Southampton, New York. May God hold our gentle mother in His loving hands. Interment private.

Charlie, as everyone called him, had not been the same since he'd lost his seat in Congress three years before. He could still be charming, especially when he wore his wide smile and sincere stare, and he liked to tell clients that serving six years as the servant of a half-million Pennsylvanians was his proudest accomplishment.

Even with a case that proves too tricky to be credible -- here, the violent history of a former military man on trial for rape is tied in with the murder in Harlem of an old woman who was at one time the mistress of King Farouk -- Alex saves face with the solid expertise she displays in the courtroom.",2004-01-11T05:00:00+0000

Lawrence wrote in Taormina. Great names and associations also mattered to me, which was another reason, lingering in the steep town of old stone and fresh flowers, I stopped by the Palazzo d'Oro, loving that name too. Beyond the gilded cast-iron faces on the spiked gateway to the terrace, I saw a handsome couple, a golden-haired woman and a beaky-faced man, dressed in loose white clothes enjoying a big Italian lunch.

Donald was born on December 20, 1928, to Elsie and George Earl Dustin of Englewood, NJ. Donald grew up in Englewood and had an affinity for music, tennis, chemistry, herpetology and electronics. He graduated from New Hampton School and attended the University of Iowa. He worked as a sound engineer for the fledgling Westminster Records. He joined IBM in 1955 and received awards for his inventions and outstanding work in quality control over 31 years. He held the patent for error correction by retransmission for mainframe computer tape drives. He was married to Virginia Sheeley in 1961; they had two children, Michael and Sarah. He was a loving father who introduced Michael to the scientific method and built dollhouses for Sarah in his shop. Vacationing at the Colony Hotel in Kennebunkport, ME, was a yearly event for the family. He was divorced from Virginia Dustin in 1982 and did not remarry. His interests included music and recording, woodworking, photography, history and politics. He was a passionate Francophile and loyal Democratic party supporter with socialist and revolutionary leanings. An event that changed his life was undergoing cancer surgery in 1985. Shortly after the surgery he retired. He pursued his passion for music with many trips to the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood and local events at Bard and Vassar Colleges. He also developed a strong interest in astronomy; from his backyard he strove to take the perfect picture of the Andromeda Galaxy using a motorized drive of his own invention. He suffered a massive stroke on December 7, 2003, which led to his death. He is survived by his children Sarah Smith and her husband Paul of Needham, MA, and Michael Dustin and his wife Lynn of New York, NY, their mother Virginia Dustin of New York, NY, four grandchildren, Jennifer, Harrison, and Emily Smith of Needham and Meredith Dustin of New York, and his brother Thomas Dustin, of Huntertown, IN. He was affectionately known as ''Grumpy Pa'' to his grandchildren, a nickname that captured his kind nature sometimes hidden behind a gruff facade. A private memorial service is planned.

After the two attackers -- the second armed with an air pistol -- tried to take cash from the register, the police said, the Sangs began struggling with them.

The New York State Environmental Protection and Spill Compensation Fund announced yesterday that it would pay for the bottled water and contribute up to $1.8 million toward the $7.3 million cost of the pipeline, expected to be completed by 2006. State officials said that for decades, gasoline and oil from leaking commercial and residential tanks spilled into the groundwater, eventually contaminating the wells of about half the 200 homes in Redwood, 23 miles north of Watertown. Starting in 1983, those homes were fitted with charcoal filters, paid for by the oil spill fund. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, above, whose office administers the fund, said the recent discovery of lead in the Redwood wells made financing the pipeline even more urgent. Anthony DePalma (NYT)",2004-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Between 1972 and 1995, she served superbly as Executive Assistant to the Museum's Director, Richard E. Oldenburg. In 1996, Ethel was named Director of Special Programming and Events. She is fondly remembered for her great loyalty and dedication to the Museum; her expertise in matters of diplomacy and protocol; her sincere solicitude for friends, colleagues and Trustees; and her love for art. Her life was enlivened by an insatiable appetite for Bakelite jewelry; a passion for Vienna, Tuscany, and St. Petersburg; and a deep love for music, which was reflected in her close involvement in the planning of the Museum's Annual SummerGarden concerts. Somehow in the midst of all she did, Ethel found time to edit a rare gem of a book, ''The American Sunrise.'' She will be deeply missed when we open our new building, but there are countless ways she will live on in it.

The company sold 7.83 million units worldwide in November and December, according to a Sony statement, below the 8.5 million sold during the same period last year. The drop was most pronounced in North America, where holiday sales totaled three million, down from four million a year ago. The results still put the company ahead of estimates from analysts, who have predicted a steep sales decline for the PlayStation 2 and other game consoles as consumers wait for new models. Analysts at WR Hambrecht, UBS Investment Research and others increased their ratings on a number of game-related stocks yesterday, based on presumptions of better-than-expected holiday sales reports. The 70 million total further widens PlayStation 2's lead over Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox, both of which are edging past the 10 million mark. Nevertheless, Nintendo reported strong holiday sales for the GameCube, on which it recently offered a discount.

Town fathers of Minnesota's capital city didn't even bother to write a nasty note to the editor. Instead, to prove that the know-it-alls ''Out East'' were just wimps, they planned an outlandish outdoor festival in the dead of winter. The annual St. Paul Winter Carnival began in 1886. This year's edition will be Jan. 22 to Feb. 8., and as always, will be a battle between Vulcanus Rex, the king of spring, and winter's King Boreas, for the future of a town where the wind chills often hit 40 below zero. A highlight this year will be the National Hockey League's All Star Game, to be held the last day of the carnival. Among the other attractions: a palace made of 27,000 bathtub-size blocks of ice (shown above being cut out of Lake Phalen); an ice carving competition, which begins Tuesday; ice skating; a giant snow slide (helmets provided); and opening day and closing night parades with elaborately outfitted floats. There is even an occasional famous visitor. In 1986, Prince crossed the river and played unannounced to a crowd that danced away in long underwear and fur caps.

A major goal of the suit appeared to be to force the doctor to turn over a guitar that he had his 12-year-old son play for a failing Mr. Harrison and that he reportedly coerced the dying musician to autograph.

Between 1972 and 1995, she served superbly as Executive Assistant to the Museum's Director, Richard E. Oldenburg. In 1996, Ethel was named Director of Special Programming and Events. She is fondly remembered for her great loyalty and dedication to the Museum; her expertise in matters of diplomacy and protocol; her sincere solicitude for friends, colleagues and Trustees; and her love for art. Her life was enlivened by an insatiable appetite for Bakelite jewelry; a passion for Vienna, Tuscany, and St. Petersburg; and a deep love for music, which was reflected in her close involvement in the planning of the Museum's Annual SummerGarden concerts. Somehow in the midst of all she did, Ethel found time to edit a rare gem of a book, ''The American Sunrise.''

After his retirement, he moved to Miami, Florida where he continued to touch the lives of all he came in contact with until his final days.

Many others who had grown up in households like mine remember the peculiar form of that speech under the pressure of pain. The memories-no, not memories but emanations-of wartime experiences kept erupting in flashes of imagery, in abrupt, fragmented phrases, in repetitious, broken refrains. Beyond that, and in the lacunae between words, there was that most private and potent of family languages-the language of the body. The past broke through in the sounds of nightmares, the idiom of sighs and illness, of tears and the acute aches that were the legacy of the damp attic and the conditions my parents endured during their hiding. In the midst of her daily round, my mother would suddenly be overcome by a sharp, terrible image, or by tears. On other subjects, she was robustly articulate; but when sudden recall of her loved ones punctured her mind's protective membrane, speech came in frail phrases, in litanies of sorrow.

Eighty-six percent rated their overall education experience as good or excellent, while 95 percent said they would recommend their college to a friend or family member.

She was born on April 14, 1931, in Portland, Oregon, the only daughter to James F. and Marion L. Miller. Graduating from Stanford University in '53 with a B.A. in English, she went to live on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco where she was active in the literary scene around the famous avant-garde City Lights Bookshop founded by Pete Martin and later run by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In '55 she moved to New York City to work in publishing. She made an impression in the literary and artistic circles of Greenwich Village, and became a close friend of novelist Dawn Powell, and later her Executor. She also spent free time with a group of artists known as the Abstract-Expressionists, or the ''New York School,'' which included such well known painters as Kline, De Kooning, Pollock, Rothko, Guston, Frank O'Hara, etc. She was known to say she ''did her graduate work at the Cedar Bar.'' She eloped in '62 during Cuban Missile Week with the distinguished artist, Dan Rice, a junior member of the Cedar crowd. Their first daughter, Hilary Dawn, was born in '65 and they moved to Haddam Neck in the Connecticut River Valley. There, among many other endeavors, she pursued her avid interest in photography. She was an ardent protester of the Vietnam War. O'Shaughnessy (Shauna) was born in '69, and will be giving birth to Jackie's first grandchild in the spring. The family moved to Guilford, CT, in '76. She and Dan divorced in '82, but remained close until his death in January '03. In Guilford, she worked in real estate for several years and found a true calling in the restoration of historic Guilford homes. Most recently she returned to publishing and produced two books of work by the American artist, Al Hirschfeld, with Glenn Young at Applause Books. She pursued with her typical passion her interests in the environment, gardening, activism, cooking, art, literature, antiques, preservation, and conservation. She had magnificent gardens and enjoyed viewing, with her cats, all the wildlife that would come to visit at her Clapboard Hill home. Jackie's philanthropy was drawn out by such causes as The Library of America, Friends of the Columbia River Gorge, NPR and PBS. The world has lost a great part of its precious luster and excitement.

But why should his suffering deter a Hollywood producer from roping him into a publicity campaign to sell a movie? In what is surely the most bizarre commercial endorsement since Eleanor Roosevelt did an ad for Good Luck Margarine in 1959, the ailing pontiff has been recruited, however unwittingly, to help hawk ''The Passion of the Christ,'' as Mel Gibson's film about Jesus's final 12 hours is now titled.

Ethel began her career at the Museum in 1965 as Promotions Manager in its Department of Publications. Between 1972 and 1995, she served superbly as Executive Assistant to the Museum's Director, Richard E. Oldenburg. In 1996, Ethel was named Director of Special Programming and Events. She is fondly remembered for her great loyalty and dedication to the Museum; her expertise in matters of diplomacy and protocol; her sincere solicitude for friends, colleagues and Trustees; and her love for art. Her life was enlivened by an insatiable appetite for Bakelite jewelry; a passion for Vienna, Tuscany, and St. Petersburg; and a deep love for music, which was reflected in her close involvement in the planning of the Museum's Annual SummerGarden concerts. Somehow in the midst of all she did, Ethel found time to edit a rare gem of a book, ''The American Sunrise.''

us,Impossibly Large Shoes,"''What Shakespeare is to Elizabethan theater, Dickens to the Victorian novel, and Picasso to modern art, Chaplin is to 20th-century cinema,'' Jeffrey Vance writes in CHAPLIN: Genius of the Cinema (Abrams, $50). Charles Chaplin (1889-1977) lived an extraordinarily rich and productive life, turbulent, full of romance (and romances), and this gorgeous, unwieldy slab of a book succeeds in being several books at once: filmography, biography, critical appraisal and family album. Its chief interest is its more than 500 photographs, many of them familiar images freshly reproduced from original Chaplin studio negatives. Many more are backstage shots: Chaplin with Einstein, Gandhi and George Bernard Shaw; Chaplin in an inexhaustible variety of costumes, poses, attitudes, situations; Chaplin in old age photographed by his fourth wife, Oona. The captions are troves of film arcana -- for instance, that Dean Riesner, 4 years old in 1923 when he played the bratty kid in a pageboy in ''The Pilgrim,'' later became a screenwriter for Clint Eastwood's ''Dirty Harry'' pictures. Vance, who has written books on Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, is generous in quoting the many fine writers who have interpreted Chaplin's art (chief among them Chaplin himself), but his judicious text is as fascinating as the photographs. ''The birth of modern comedy,'' he writes, ''occurred when Chaplin donned his derby hat, affixed his toothbrush mustache and stepped into his impossibly large shoes for the first time.''

us,The Dog in the Fight,"These are dark days, indeed, for one of New York City's best known and much maligned residents, the pit bull. The dog has long been a fixture in the tabloids and local news for the inevitable attacks that result from their corrupted rearing. But perhaps underscoring how debased the beast has become is the latest outcry for its banishment, spawned by the misdeed of another breed entirely, the Rottweiler, one of whose kind mauled a 3-year-old boy in the Bronx in October. (The dog's owner, it turned out, was a former convict and parole violator.) The incident sparked the by-now familiar and sadly hollow outcry to ban ''bad breeds,'' as one local tabloid referred to them. In some cities, certain breeds can be singled out as dangerous and required to wear muzzles. Many municipalities across the U.S. have banned pit bulls outright, Denver, Miami-Dade County and Cincinnati among them. And now a number of New York State lawmakers are pushing to overturn a current state law that prohibits cities and towns from banning specific dogs. In a single stroke, this course of action makes the dog the scapegoat for the true culprits while also ensuring that it remains, precisely because of its ''outlaw'' status, the breed of choice for inner-city wannabe hoods and backwoods anarchists alike. The pit bull's image has become so skewed that New York City Animal Care and Control, the city's animal-welfare agency, recently decided to give the dog a public relations makeover by renaming it the ''New Yorkie.''",2004-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,The Witty Star of 'The Gerry Show',"WHEN the Tony Award-winning theater director Gerald Gutierrez died suddenly late last month at the unripe age of 53, the stories about him immediately began to flow. An actor's director, who understood exactly how to elicit emotionally moving performances from his casts, he had an obsession with detail that made each production tick like a perfectly calibrated clock. His back-to-back Tonys for best director in 1995 and 1996 -- for revivals of ''The Heiress'' and ''A Delicate Balance,'' respectively -- honored what the actors, playwrights and other theater people who worked with him already knew very well. His style and flair may have seemed effortless, but his research for every production -- both classic revivals and new plays -- was ferocious. Mr. Gutierrez, who apparently died of respiratory failure from the effects of the flu, was a cancer survivor who came out of the experience ''full of life,'' as the actress Cherry Jones says. He was an impatient man with enormous patience, a serious student of the theater with a wicked sense of humor, a private soul who took his Yorkshire terrier Phyllis to the 1995 Tony Awards (''It was deflective behavior,'' he said in a 1996 interview with Alex Witchel in The New York Times, ''if you look at the dog, you're not looking at the scars'' from the cancer surgery).

(Pi Recordings) is an album-length ''song-cycle about people in airports,'' by jazz musicians (including the pianist Vijay Iyer) and hip-hoppers (including the rapper and poet Mike Ladd). The basic idea, explored in 17 different vignettes, is what happens to dark-complexioned travelers since Sept. 11 -- the quest to be a citizen of the world versus the didactic lessons of Homeland Security. With a seven-piece band playing odd-meter funk, lulling ambient chords, blots of rhythm under Indian-accented raps, it's that elusive thing, underground political music that sounds good. And though its points of origin are far from the mainstream of either hip-hop or jazz, let's count it as a breakthrough hip-hop-jazz fusion. Because if we do, it's one of the smartest I've heard, and one of the few that really works.

Bush is ""walking on clouds"" these days. A second term? It seems as good as certain. The pundits are saying that Karl Rove, the seemingly all-knowing jack-of-all-trades and chief strategist behind Bush' upcoming victory at the polls, is capable of achieving miracles. They call him, half-mockingly and half-respectfully, the ""Master of the Universe."" Indeed, the incumbent, nine months before the election, seems to be in the best of positions: arch-enemy Saddam Hussein, literally pulled from a hole in the ground, is behind bars, his palaces now filled with victorious US soldiers. Although the attacks in Iraq are not becoming less violent, they are decreasing . The most recent quarterly data on the US economy are encouraging, and the Bush campaign's war chest is overflowing.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Unisys Posts 25% Profit Increase,"The Unisys Corporation, which sells server computers and related services to businesses, said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit increased 25 percent, lifted by a decline in the value of the dollar, and cost cutting. Net income rose to $111.5 million, or 33 cents a share, from $89.1 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., said. All of the 5.1 percent increase in sales, to $1.64 billion from $1.55 billion, came from the falling dollar. Revenue increased 5 percent in 2003, the first annual growth for Unisys since 1999, as the chief executive, Lawrence A. Weinbach, added new products and services and won orders from the United States government. Outsourcing orders declined in the quarter, lagging investors' expectations for an increase of as much as 10 percent, said David Garrity, an analyst with American Technology Research Inc. Shares of Unisys dropped 99 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $14.70. Excluding pension costs, Unisys reiterated profit estimates of 83 cents to 87 cents a share this year and 11 cents to 13 cents this quarter. Sales will rise in both periods by a percentage in the ''mid-single digits,'' the company said without elaborating.",2004-01-21T05:00:00+0000

They range from ''How to Embellish Dominant-Seventh Chords and the Use of Tritone Subs'' (clinician: Jamey Aebersold, a pre-eminent publisher of jazz instruction books), to the much more contentious ''The Contributions and Influence of Latino Musicians in Jazz: A Supreme Historical Oversight'' (moderated by the percussionist Bobby Sanabria). In and around the panels and workshops will be dozens of performances, including those by Paquito D'Rivera and the New York Voices, the Dave Holland Quintet, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, Jason Moran's Bandwagon, Bob Brookmeyer and the New Art Orchestra, Nicholas Payton, David Sanchez, Michel Camilo, Jazz at Lincoln Center's Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, the English vocal-jazz newcomer Jamie Cullum, and the 14-year-old Italian saxophonist Francesco Cafiso.

A spokesman for Chief Chambers said she refused the offer because it would have required her to seek permission before talking to reporters or members of Congress. Chief Chambers was placed on administrative leave on Dec. 5 after arguing publicly that her department was understaffed and underfinanced. ",2004-01-22T05:00:00+0000

The investigation was prompted by accusations from the Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee, an alliance of shrimp harvesters, processors and distributors based in states from Georgia to Texas. If the investigation finds against the exporters, tariffs could be imposed.

Sure, the sun isn't quite as warming, but tupelo honey runs pure in national forests, rivers flow along moss-threaded cypress stands, and Apalachicola Bay -- one of the planet's richest -- lavishes diners with choice seafood. The ideal base camp is the town of Apalachicola, 75 miles southwest of Tallahassee. It has long been famous for its oysters and lately for its demeanor: a historic fisherman's haven with stylish inns and galleries but solid Old South roots. Known locally as Apalach, it was founded by 19th-century sponge divers and cotton and lumber barons. Their restored Georgian and Victorian manses and cottages idle along the bay, and their descendants work hard hauling shrimp, fish, crabs and oysters. Meanwhile, newcomers trickle in (the population is barely 3,000), opening fashionable boutiques, cafes and antiques stores in former cotton warehouses. Minutes from Apalach, the white sands of the barrier-island beaches are so smooth and quiet, locals guarantee that ''you can hear the fiddler crabs shuffle by.''

In light of the chaotic 2000 presidential election, the Swarthmore students decided that this information shouldn't be kept from the public.

Nobody who has seen it has forgotten it, and many who have never seen it are nonetheless aware of it. The man, with studied casualness, applies his razor to the eyeball of a woman seated in front of a window.

He then traveled to Russia to celebrate the three hundredth birthday of St. Petersburg and to sign the papers formally ratifying a treaty committing Moscow and Washington to slash their nuclear arsenals. He flew on to Evian, a city in the French Alps, to attend a summit meeting of the heads of the world's major economies. He next stopped in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, for a meeting with moderate Arab leaders, before heading to Aqaba, Jordan, on the shore of the Red Sea to discuss the road map for peace with the Israeli and Palestinian prime ministers. He made his final stop in Doha, Qatar, where troops at U.S. Central Command greeted him with thunderous applause. Now Bush looked down on the city that American troops had seized only weeks before.

Sherlock Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson, long ago joined various male duos (among them the Lone Ranger and Tonto, Batman and Robin and even Frodo and Sam) as the subject of smirks, winks and occasionally more earnest efforts at extracting the hidden meanings of pop icons. But Robb -- who offers his speculations on the sexual orientation of Holmes and other literary sleuths in a coda to a book that's mostly about historical figures -- doesn't want his observations taken for mere crude outing. He is not, he insists, engaged in ''a sly attempt to ensnare the great detective in the elastic web of gay revisionism.''",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

Who was Baxter? A good question, often asked, and answered by a framed sheet of skilfully antiqued paper on the wall of the restaurant at the end of the promontory, the one in the best, highest and most prestigious position. Baxter's, it was called, claiming that the inner room of thin brick and reed had been Bill Baxter's shack, built by his own hands. He had been a restless voyager, a seaman who had chanced on this paradise of a bay with its little tongue of rocky land. Earlier versions of the tale hinted at pacific and welcoming natives. Where did the Teeth come into it? Baxter remained an inveterate explorer of nearby shores and islands, and then, having entrusted himself to a little leaf of a boat built out of driftwood and expertise, he was wrecked one moony night on those seven black rocks, well within the sight of his little house where a storm lantern, as reliable as a lighthouse, welcomed in ships small enough to get into the bay, having negotiated the reef.

A suggestion is to spend the money and take a certification course including all pool and classwork at a local NAUI or PADI dive shop recommended by others. If you do not want to do your open-water certification dives in cold water, then you can do them at a certified warm-weather resort where there are also other activities.

The story Biskind tells is a paradoxical one, in which every chapter in the rise of the elusive ''independent spirit'' is also an episode in its decline -- its corruption by money, celebrity worship and all the other elements of Hollywood business as usual. Such moments stretch back a decade or more, to Miramax's absorption by Disney, to the first time a distribution deal was made at Sundance, to the coronation of Quentin Tarantino as King of the Indies.",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,'Collected Poems'," Despite all the red flags it raises -- a famous novelist publishing a book of poems, the most recent of which are nearly 25 years old -- this is not the work of a dabbler. Before making his name as a writer of postmodern mysteries, Paul Auster was a poet almost exclusively. He spent his 20's apprenticed to the French Surrealists, the American Objectivists and a handful of hard-to-classify poets like William Bronk, perhaps the most conspicuous influence here. ''Collected Poems'' is dominated by sequences of short, dense lyric meditations on the nature of reality and our inability to apprehend or describe it: ''everything / has changed in us, if we speak / of the world / it is only to leave the world / unsaid.'' But Auster rarely achieves Bronk's clarity or control. Translations of several French poets -- Rene Char, Andre Breton -- feel right at home, not because Auster makes English seem like their natural idiom but because his own poems so often read like French Surrealism in translation: ''Along with your ashes, the barely / written ones, obliterating / the ode, the incited roots, the alien / eye -- with imbecilic hands, they dragged you / into the city.'' Here Auster seems reluctant to make any phrase syntactically subordinate to another. Does ''ones'' refer back to ''your ashes'' or forward to ''they''? What's doing the ''obliterating''? Hard-core admirers of Auster, or of his poetic models, might also admire this sort of terminal indeterminacy. Others will prefer the more involving mysteries of his prose. ",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

After further studies in art education at the University of Virginia, University of Richmond, and Columbia University, she obtained a master's in fine arts at Alfred in 1946. From 1946 to 1982, Ms. Hartsook was the Director of Greenwich House Pottery in NYC. Under her direction Greenwich House grew from a locally acclaimed pottery school to become an internationally renowned institution with a gallery, a permanent collection, book and slide libraries, and a staff of well known artists working, exhibiting and instructing. Awarded honorary membership in the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts in 1982, she became a member of the New York Settlement Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1992, recognizing her status as an artist and administrator, Greenwich House presented a retrospective of 50 years of her work, and the gallery, founded by her in 1970, was named the Jane Hartsook Gallery.

But if there is one thing I've learned in examining this issue it's this: ideas don't just spread on their own. Ideas spread in a context. So often, since 9/11, people have remarked to me: ''Wow, Islam, that's a really angry religion.'' I disagree. I do agree, though, that there are a lot of young Muslims who are angry, because they live in some of the most repressive societies, with the fewest opportunities for women and youth, and with some of the highest unemployment. Bad contexts create an environment where humiliation -- and the anger, bad ideas and violence that flow from it -- are rife. In short, it is impossible for us to talk about winning the war of ideas in the Arab-Muslim world without talking about the most basic thing that gives people dignity and hope: A job.",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

On his television and radio shows, he supposedly cast out Satan and his minions from the possessed. ''Crying Demons'' and ''I Am Lucifer,'' both reissued as separate CD's on the Mad Deadly Worldwide label (available at independent stores like Amoeba Music), are just two of 50-some recordings of sermons and songs from this so-called exorcist. ''Crying Demons,'' the better of the two, alternates between creepy and comical as Mr. Allen, who died in 1970, converses with (and ultimately banishes) the demons inhabiting the bodies of the faithful. Sometimes, however, these exorcisms sound more like an argument between siblings, as in the following excerpt:",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000
us,Dreaming in the New Russia,"The people in THE RED PASSPORT (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22), Katherine Shonk's collection of stories about life in post-Soviet society, can be roughly divided between real Russians and those who wish they were; natives trying to get out; well-meaning Americans trying to fit in; and some older types still trying to wake from the nightmare of the New World Order. ''Their desire to be in each other's countries hung between them,'' Shonk writes of a pair of couples, ''embarrassing and sad, as if the four of them were misfits who, full of false hope, expected to fit in elsewhere.'' Fresh from the Chechen conflict, Sasha in ''Our American'' plans to save his younger brother from conscription by marrying Amy, the cute girl from Ohio who works on a collective farm; the three of them, he thinks, will simply move to America. Temporarily stuck in Prague, an American named Rachel in ''Honey Month'' is faced with a painful decision: returning to her selfish boyfriend in Moscow or helping an expectant Russian couple desperate to get to America. Leslie, the American descendant of czarist-era nobility in ''Kitchen Friends,'' is so convinced she's a real Russian that she proclaims imaginary guilt over her ancestors' treatment of serfs -- a stance that cuts no ice with the locals. (''Russian-American, eh?'' sneers one. ''Like a dictionary?'') In ''The Conversion,'' a rootless American named Tom finds himself returning to Russia following a nasty breakup because he ''harbored a secret conviction that if he remained in America, he would always regard his time in Russia as the best of his life.'' In her first collection, Shonk sees these and other varied perestroikans with an eye both rueful and ruthless, sympathetic to their dreams even as she sees through them. She writes with the comfortable sense of one who has not only been there but taken a good look around. Rodney Welch",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

Just four years earlier, his predecessor Herbert Hoover had told a far more optimistic and celebratory gathering: ""We are steadily building a new race, a new civilization great in its own attainments."" Hoover had taken office in a time of unmatched prosperity and mass affluence, which seemed likely to continue into the indefinite future. He had delivered only hard times and mass unemployment. He had not been primarily to blame for a worldwide economic catastrophe, but he undeniably had failed to cope with it. As he left office a dour, bitter man, the nation seemed in a state of collapse. In many other countries, contenders for power might have been fighting in the streets. ",2004-01-25T05:00:00+0000

He was 68, and lived in Norwalk, CT. The cause was lung cancer, said his wife Patricia Pinto Pond. C.W., as he was known, completed hundreds of projects in and around Fairfield County Connecticut. These projects involved electrical design, new construction and corporate renovation. Chuck built a clientele that has been loyal to him and the C.W. Pond family for more than 30 years.

His peers, associates and customers recognized and respected him as a leader in the industry with a vision that allowed him to excel in the trade. He was a highly respected pioneer in design and build and value engineer concepts, and has passed his knowledge on to his son Jeff and other key members of the C.W. Pond team. Chuck was a proud veteran of the armed forces, having served in the U.S. Army in the First Howitzer Battalion, Second Artillery, in Baumholder, Germany. After his service, Pond relocated to Stamford, CT. Pond had a long and prosperous career as a contractor in Fairfield County, having formed various C.W. Pond companies, starting in 1974. He was an avid yachtsman and a member of the Stamford Yacht Club and New York Yacht Club. He began boating in 1979, and sailed for many years on sailboats that bore the name ''Perpetual Motion.''

Coloradans approved a constitutional amendment in 1994 that extended the term-limit law to ''nonjudicial'' elected officials. That followed disputes over whether the office of district attorney, a career position in many regions, was included. In 2002, voters rejected a statewide referendum to exempt prosecutors.

At the same time, Japan's surplus with the United States fell for the 12th consecutive month as Japanese automakers and other producers build more of their goods in North America.

Mr. Galeazzi should lend credibility to Parmalat's management, which is trying to keep its day-to-day operations running without any backing from banks, Mr. Champi said. Like its Italian parent, Parmalat's Brazilian unit operated under two sets of rules, one for its listed operational unit, which owes local banks $160 million, and another more byzantine set of practices used by its two holding companies under direct control of the Tanzi family in Parma. Bankers say the total owed by the two Brazilian holding companies, which were involved in financing acquisitions in the 1990's and Parmalat's expensive sports marketing and soccer interests, could exceed $1.6 billion.

The new version, which returned to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard adult contemporary chart in the Jan. 31 issue and has lingered on the chart for an astonishing 46 weeks, is a duet teaming Mr. Gray with Uncle Kracker, the longtime Kid Rock sideman. It has been 39 years since Mr. Gray, born Lawrence Darrow Brown in Texas and nicknamed after the 1960's television character Dobie Gillis, first reached the pop Top 20 with the soulful '' 'In' Crowd.'' Since then he has had many record deals with mixed success; moved to Los Angeles to be a movie star (acting instead in the theatrical production of ''Hair''); relocated to Nashville in 1978 to become a country singer and songwriter, and wrote with George Reneau a No. 1 country hit for John Conlee (''Got My Heart Set On You,'' 1986). But like most black artists (except Charley Pride and briefly Ray Charles), Mr. Gray ran into a brick wall with Nashville executives and country radio programmers. In a music world becoming ever more diverse, Mr. Gray sees country's de facto whites-only approach as severely outdated. ''It kills the industry,'' he said in an interview. ''I think that's why the country market is kind of in limbo. It needs a new infusion. I'm not saying it needs to be a black artist, but it needs something new.''

The farmers' associations said they were still working out final details, but in principle agreed to pay royalties. The deal foresees royalties of 20 reais ($7) per metric ton for the 2004 and 2005 harvests. For crops just harvested, the charge would be as low as 10 reais ($3.50) a metric ton, Monsanto said.

MyDoom is the fastest-spreading computer virus to date, with some 300,000 infected computers and 160,000 virus-bearing e-mail messages zinging across the Internet every hour, said Craig Schmugar, a virus researcher for Network Associates. He and other virus experts said it will program infected computers to start an online attack on Sunday against SCO Group, which sells the Unix operating system. The new version will begin a similar attack against Microsoft, and blocks access to antivirus online sites that could help users protect against the malicious software, as well as some online advertising sites. The goal of the programmer behind the worms, said Mr. Schmugar, appears to be creating a large population of machines that can be controlled remotely for such purposes as sending spam and diverting online advertising traffic.

us,Technology Briefing | Software: Microsoft Won't Make Changes For Patent,"Microsoft said yesterday that it would not, ''for now,'' make changes in its software as a result of a court ruling in which a jury told it to pay $521 million for infringing patents related to Internet Explorer. Microsoft had said in October that it was considering modest changes that would let Web developers who use Internet Explorer technology avoid any concern of infringing a University of California patent licensed to Eolas Technologies. A federal jury in Chicago said Microsoft impermissibly used technology for methods for navigating the Internet. Microsoft is appealing the verdict and the Patent and Trademark Office is reviewing whether the patent should have been issued. Microsoft's Internet Explorer has 96 percent of the worldwide market for Web browser software. ''The steps were modest that we were proposing, and the feedback that we were getting from the industry was, rather than change something, just hold off'' until the appeal and patent office review are resolved, a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Desler, said. An Eolas lawyer, Martin Lueck, said the announcement illustrated how important the technology was to the browser.",2004-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Stevens textile plants, which took over four years and ended in a contractual agreement in 1980.
