us,Whats On Friday,"10:15 P.M. (TCM) A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) Russell Crowe, above, in a role for which he received an Oscar nomination, portrays John Forbes Nash Jr., the gifted mathematician who battled schizophrenia for decades before going on to win the Nobel in economic science. Jennifer Connelly won for best supporting actress as Alicia Larde, the M.I.T. student who became Nashs wife. And Ed Harris plays Nashs contact for a government project. The paradox of this film (which won for best picture), directed by Ron Howard from a script by Akiva Goldsman, and the emotions it elicits is that the story is almost entirely counterfeit, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, Mr. Crowe, with his superhuman powers of concentration, shows us a man who dwells almost entirely in an inner world, and he dramatizes that inwardness as if nobody were watching. In the end, Mr. Scott added, the governing dynamic of A Beautiful Mind is sentimentality of a familiar and not altogether unwelcome kind. The movie can  indeed, should  be intellectually rejected, but you cant quite banish it from your mind. ",2014-01-03T06:00:06+0000

But his work in Algeria  not nearly so well known  has also enhanced his reputation as one of the 20th centurys great architects. Niemeyer, a Communist who fled to France following the military takeover of Brazil in 1964, designed several buildings in Algeria in the late 1960s (as well as a library in recent years that is still being built). The plan for one, La Coupole, a sports arena in Algiers, which can be seen in the slide show here, was made on a napkin. Mekki Damerdji, an architect and professor in Algiers, says Mentouri University (shown here), in the city of Constantine, is a favorite of his for its stark contrast to the more traditional buildings that dominate the countrys landscape.

(HBO) ADMISSION (2013) Tina Fey (above, seated) portrays Portia Nathan, a Princeton admissions officer who seems to take a special kind of glee in controlling the fate of applicants aspiring to the universitys ivy-covered halls. She also has a goal of her own: to succeed the retiring dean of admissions (Wallace Shawn) and beat out her office rival (Gloria Reuben) while reclaiming Princetons place at the top of the U.S. News & World Report rankings. But just as her smug English-professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) dumps her for an aggressive Virginia Woolf scholar (Sonya Walger), a fellow Dartmouth alum (Paul Rudd) comes along with an unusual student (Nat Wolff) he wants Portia to consider. How could anyone make light of the brutal, capricious system by which our young people are judged and sorted? A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this comedy from Paul Weitz, adapted from the novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. And I must confess that I dont know whether to be relieved or disappointed that Admission, which had the potential to be a sharp, satirical jab at the soft belly of middle-class anxiety, chose instead to be a warm and wacky fable of wish fulfillment. Mr. Weitz lines up a target placed at the explosive intersection of class, race, region and every other source of societal anguish, and then does not so much miss as aim in another direction  or several  letting fly a volley of darts that land as lightly as badminton birdies. Still, Ms. Fey and Mr. Rudd are fun to watch, though not as much fun as they might have been in a riskier, crazier movie, he said, adding that the best scenes belong to Lily Tomlin, brilliantly cast as Portias mother, an unbowed second-wave woman warrior with a pair of borzois and a Bella Abzug tattoo.",2014-01-04T06:15:04+0000

(13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY A fourth round of the writer Julian Fellowess sudsy British hit about aristocrats and their servants begins as Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) mourns the death of her husband, Matthew, who was killed on the day of the birth of their baby, George, at the end of last season. But Mary finds motherhood to be scant solace, and Matthews death has left the estates financial future shaky, since he apparently did not leave a will. Meanwhile, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) appears to have at long last found love with the editor Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards); Lady Rose (Lily James), the niece of the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), stirs things up with her newfound fondness for jazz and her particular appreciation for the singer Jack Ross (Gary Carr); and Isobel Crawley (Penelope Wilton) struggles with her place in the family, now that her son Matthew is no longer in the picture. (Sophie McShera, as Daisy, is above.)

Offering decadent visions of alternate realities and mystic rituals, the films became a favorite with audiences of that era, as well as with generations of (often stoned) college students ever since. The 84-year-old director, who lives in Paris, recently returned to his hometown of Tocopilla, Chile, to make The Dance of Reality, an autobiographical film that also manages to be a hypnotic surrealist fantasia.

Doctorow, who has in his half-century of writing fiction placed a remarkable number of people, both real and imagined, in their history just to watch them respond. At first Andrew, whose time is the bewilderingly eventful opening decade of this century, doesnt sound like much of a witness: A self-described freakishly depressive cognitive scientist klutz, he seems far more interested in the workings of his own mind than those of the world outside, and for a long time speaks  to someone he calls Doc  only of his messy private life and his largely fruitless research into the mysteries of the human brain. He cracks cynical jokes, tells parts of his life story in the third person, indulges in a fair bit of glib self-analysis (I am finally, terribly, unfeeling) and generally plays the fool.

Its imagery ostensibly illustrated health and fitness, but was really aimed at what was then an underground gay market. Mizer (1922-92) was a pioneer in making explicit the genres erotic appeal, enough so to attract attention from legal authorities. In 1947, he was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor by taking nude pictures of a 17-year-old, and he spent a year in prison. In 1954, he was convicted of distributing obscene material through the mail. (That conviction was reversed on appeal a couple of years later.) Those speed bumps didnt stop Mizers enterprise as a commercial photographer and publisher from growing to the point at which it occupied four lots near downtown Los Angeles, like a Hollywood movie studio, earning him the nickname the Hugh Hefner of gay publishing. Mizer, evidently, was blessedly free of high-art pretension, but Physique Pictorial was nevertheless an inspiration for artists like David Hockney and Robert Mapplethorpe. ",2014-01-09T22:05:35+0000

Powers has won a National Book Award and has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; he has been the recipient of a MacArthur genius grant; he has elicited lavish praise from the critics  most of them, anyway. Two of the words most frequently employed in connection with his literary output are cerebral and ambitious. Cerebral refers to his tendency to lace his novels with scientific and scholarly themes, like artificial intelligence in Galatea 2.2, game theory in Prisoners Dilemma and musicology cum genetic recombination in The Gold Bug Variations.

Im notorious for liking very simple food, he told Virgin Media in 2000. You can take me to some of the worlds top restaurants and Ill leave half of it on the plate. Food is not hugely important to me. Thats not to say Higgins never dines out  a restaurant near his home in the Channel Islands doubles as his office, he explained in the same interview. I go in at lunchtime, do two hours work, and then I eat, he said. And then in the evening Ill go in and do three hours and then Ill eat.

But focusing only on the violent context of his work undermines what it set out to prove, which is that radical art can flourish even in repressive circumstances, and that it can be a form of communication, liberation and optimism, as the title Paulo Bruscky: Art Is Our Last Hope suggests. Installed at the Bronx Museum, the exhibition includes 140 works of sculpture, performance documentation, mail art and photography made between 1971 and 2011. ",2014-01-10T22:36:00+0000

Thousands are believed to have been killed and 200,000 displaced by the fighting, which has involved the countrys largest two ethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer.

The United Nations Security Council on Friday urged the warring parties to stop the fighting, continue negotiations and ensure the protection of the countrys oil fields.

The protesters had denounced the prosecution of the three men as politically motivated and a show trial and pointed to evidence showing that the Boryspil City Council had voted to remove the Lenin statue even before the alleged plot was discovered. About 100 protesters had gathered at the courthouse in Kiev for the verdict. The clashes began after the three defendants were sentenced to six years in prison. Among the injured was Yuri V. Lutsenko, a former interior minister and an outspoken opposition leader who helped coordinate the recent mass demonstrations in central Kiev against the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich. Local news agencies reported that Mr. Lutsenko had been knocked unconscious. Mr. Lutsenko, who was also an organizer of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is the leader of an opposition party called the Third Ukrainian Republic. ",2014-01-11T04:54:56+0000

The most radical aspect of The Place Beyond the Pines is its relentless linearity, the way it tells its story without foreshadowing or flashing back or resorting to other conventional shortcuts, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this three-part drama, directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine). Watching it is refreshing and absorbing partly because it is rare for a film to show this kind of confidence in its own narrative momentum, which is also a gesture of faith in the audiences willingness to pay attention. He added, Your attention is especially rewarded by the work of Mr. Gosling and Mr. Cooper, who offer contrasting studies in tragic, shortsighted masculine intensity. ",2014-01-11T06:00:05+0000

Feuer, who moved upstate several years ago and commutes to his eponymous Chelsea gallery, says he wanted to try something outside the pressure cooker. Even Retrospectives name alludes to what Mesler, the owner of Untitled Gallery on the Lower East Side, called the speed of the art world  in which younger and younger artists land exhibitions surveying their already oversize careers.

us,Weighing In at the End,"Three-Fourths of an Ounce, a new line of condolence products including memorial candles and jewelry, is named after measurements taken by the early 1900s Massachusetts doctor Duncan MacDougall. After studying terminally ill people and euthanized dogs, he concluded that a body lost three-quarters of an ounce at the moment of death, so a soul must weigh that much. (Scientists, however, have since discredited his methods and data.) The designer Ted Muehling has contributed polished quartz ovals ($200 each) that weigh, yes, 0.75 ounces. His staff grinds the stones at a workshop behind his Manhattan boutique, on machines with wet sandpaper wheels that emit mournful sounds as they spin. Mr. Muehling, who was brought up Catholic, said the translucent stones remind him of his childhood image of the soul as an internal vapor that grows cloudier with every sin. The polished talismans are also ecumenically reminiscent of crystal orbs that Buddhist temple statues carry and pebbles that Jews place on gravestones.

Lizzie Borden Took an Ax, a telling of the real-life story being shown on Saturday at 8 p.m. on Lifetime, isnt shy about speculating on what actually happened in the Borden household in Fall River that bloody August day, though that has remained in dispute for more than a century. The movie also presents the record of Lizzies arrest and trial, whose conclusion wont be spoiled here for the sake of those not up on their murder history. The cast includes Billy Campbell as Lizzies lawyer and Clea DuVall as her sister, Emma. Also listed are credits for three Jump Rope Girls.

In the meantime, her gallery is being revisited in Hooray for Hollywood!, a big, sumptuous exhibition spread between adjacent Chelsea galleries, Mixed Greens and Pavel Zoubok. The show has the added advantage of offering a relatively wide-angle view of the 1970s and the 80s, a period that recent curatorial habit  most prominently at the Museum of Modern Art  has reduced to a depressingly thin gruel of Post-Minimalism, Conceptual art and appropriation art.",2014-01-16T22:48:08+0000

Under the Wide and Starry Sky is at once a classic artistic bildungsroman and a retort to the genre, a novel that shows how love and marriage can simultaneously offer inspiration and encumbrance, especially when the more successful partner believes that, as far as artists go, a family could tolerate only one.

Fridays clashes are the first evidence that the new charter is unlikely to resolve the complaints of the protest movement, the terrorist threat from a budding insurgency or Egypts deep divisions. At least one protester was killed in Fayoum, south of Cairo, and another on the outskirts of Cairo. Separately, a report from Democracy International, an election-monitoring group that sent 80 observers to track the constitutional referendum, said it had serious concerns about the political environment of the voting, with arrests and detention of dissenting voices and no real opportunity for those opposed to the governments road map of the proposed constitution to dissent.

The number of rhinos illegally killed in South Africa has been climbing since at least 2010, when 333 deaths were reported. Susie Ellis, of the global nonprofit group International Rhino Foundation, said the latest figure was almost certainly an undercount. Those are only the deaths that we know about, she said.

Passing a bill that criminalizes emergency care and punishes those who care for injured protesters is part of the Turkish governments relentless effort to silence any opposing voices, said Dr. Vincent Iacopino, senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups that had campaigned against the legislation.

us,Japan: Lawmaker Defends Shrine Visit," A top Japanese lawmaker on Friday denounced American criticism of Prime Minister Shinzo Abes visit last month to a Tokyo war shrine, comparing it to American politicians paying their respects at Arlington National Cemetery. The lawmaker, Koichi Hagiuda of Mr. Abes governing Liberal Democratic Party, said it was unfair for the United States to expect Japanese leaders to refrain from visiting the Yasukuni shrine, which honors the nations war dead, when American politicians can freely honor their fallen soldiers. If Japan says, Its unfavorable to pay a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, do they refrain from going there? Mr. Hagiuda, a special adviser to Mr. Abe, was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News Agency. I assume the United States will say, Its none of a foreign countrys business. Mr. Hagiuda was responding to an American government statement expressing disappointment with Mr. Abes visit to the controversial Shinto shrine on Dec. 26. Washington feared such a visit could anger other Asian nations, where Yasukuni is viewed as a symbol of Japans refusal to come to terms with its brutal 20th-century militarism because it honors all war dead, including convicted war criminals. The shrine also houses a museum that views World War II as a noble struggle by Japan to liberate Asia from white imperialism. ",2014-01-18T03:43:45+0000

We will esteem the leaders and martyrs of the movement that forced the issue onto our national conscience, including the man we honor on this holiday. We will recall, too, the Southern Democrats who stood  and stalled  in defense of segregation, and the Republicans who later capitalized on the outcome with a cynical appeal to white resentment. We will lament the current attempts by several states, with the Supreme Courts blessing, to roll back the basic franchise promised in the Civil Rights Act (and reinforced by the Voting Rights Act the following year).

(Starz) CHARLIE BARTLETT (2008) After being kicked out of private school for making fake IDs, Charlie (Anton Yelchin, above) goes the public route, arriving at a high school in a chauffeured limousine, wearing a navy blazer with a Latin insignia and toting a briefcase. An instant pariah, he discovers a road to popularity paved with prescription drugs. Soon, he has become a sort of therapist, dispensing advice and medication to classmates. Hope Davis plays his flaky, depressed mother; Robert Downey Jr. is the high schools alcoholic principal, whose relationship with Charlie turns into warfare, once he learns that Charlie is dating his rebellious daughter (Kat Dennings).

McDarrah, on the other hand, made it a point to be there: when Bob Dylan first performed in New York; when Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg held court at house parties in Greenwich Village, or Andy Warhol at his studio, the Factory; when the hippies or the gay liberation movement found their voices; when downtown New York was the incubator for the cultural movements that shook the world. Mr. McDarrah, who died in 2007, was the first photo editor and for decades the only staff photographer of The Village Voice.

us,Should Pope Francis Rethink Abortion?,"Pope Francis has raised expectations of a turn away from the dogmatic intransigence that has long cast a pall over the religious life of many Roman Catholics. His question Who am I to judge? suggested a new attitude toward homosexuality, and he is apparently willing to consider allowing the use of contraceptives to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. But his position on what has come to be the hierarchys signature issue  abortion  seems unyielding. Reason alone is sufficient to recognize the inviolable value of each single human life, he declared in his recent apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, adding: Precisely because this involves the internal consistency of our message about the value of the human person, the church cannot be expected to change her position on this question.I want to explore the possibility, however, that the pope might be open to significant revision of the absolute ban on abortion by asking what happens if we take seriously his claim that reason alone is sufficient to adjudicate this issue. What actually follows regarding abortion once we accept the inviolable value of each single human life? This appeal to rational reflection has been a central feature of the tradition of Catholic moral teaching. I put forward the following reflections in the spirit of this tradition.There is considerable rational basis for moral concern about abortions. In many (probably most) cases, it would be immoral to abort a pregnancy. (Note, however, that this by no means implies that most abortions actually performed are immoral.) Late-term fetuses, for example, are no different biologically or psychologically from babies born prematurely at the same stage of development. Its hard to see how killing a premature baby is immoral but killing an identical late-term fetus isnt. At a minimum, aborting a healthy late-term fetus would, except when the mothers life is at risk, be immoral  which is no doubt why it is seldom, if ever, done.",2014-01-24T00:00:24+0000

Walter Chandoha, a photographer who is now 93, remembers the old train station fondly. He was living in New York in the late 1940s and studying at N.Y.U. on the G.I.

The stories of his new collection, Leaving the Sea, still contain peculiar linguistic and perceptual tics, but he has added to his arsenal narratives that are less relentlessly unfamiliar, less rigorously dis-enchanted, populated by characters full of longing and visible regret, though for what is not always clear. For fans of the old style, like me, there are still plenty of messed-up points of view, and we can be reassured that while most of the work in this collection begins on familiar ground, it happily disintegrates into confusion and dread.

When I took to writing plays in the 70s, it was understood that if two mature women were talking onstage, audience members would cough and shift in their seats, but if two men of any age were talking, the audience would pay some attention.

Except theres no room an yeh meet no one. Unless yeh want to. For a moment, perhaps, we think we know what to expect: a rambunctious comedy about aging musicians, working-class life, rock n roll, something fundamentally upbeat, because thats what Doyle does. Even his darker books  The Woman Who Walked Into Doors, say, that raw tale of a womans abuse at the hands of her alcoholic husband  have a way of seeming spry, sunny underneath their patina of hardscrabble realism.

(Chafetss book, Roger Ailes: Off Camera, was published in March 2013 and spent a week on the e-book nonfiction list.) On NPRs Fresh Air last month, Sherman described his efforts to interview Ailes in terms that called to mind Michael Moores early documentary Roger and Me, about the General Motors chief executive Roger Smith. I reached out to Roger Ailes more than a dozen times in the two and a half years I was doing the researching and writing, both in person and in writing, he said. I traveled to different states to see him at public events to tell him I was eager to sit down and discuss every fact in the book. Ultimately, it was his decision not to participate.

In their script for Superbad, Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg zeroed in on the tenderness and vulnerability that lie at the heart of male friendship, and here they go even further, using the prospect of global annihilation as an occasion for some touchy-feely relationship workshopping.",2014-01-25T06:00:01+0000

(Flix) A ROOM WITH A VIEW (1986) An Englishwoman (Helena Bonham Carter, above left with Judi Dench)) is torn between her strait-laced fianc (Daniel Day-Lewis) and a young bohemian (Julian Sands) in this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forsters 1908 novel, with an Oscar-winning screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby said the film is like a holiday out of time. In Robert Altmans Gosford Park (2001), at 10, a coterie of aristocrats and their servants gather for a weekend shooting party at a grand English country estate in November 1932, during which their host, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) is murdered. Whodunit? The suspects include Sir Williams chilly wife, Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), and her younger sister (Geraldine Somerville), with whom she cut cards to determine who would snag the man and his millions; the handsome young valet (Ryan Phillippe) on whom Lady Sylvia has set her sights; a gay American movie producer (Bob Balaban, who devised the movies concept with Mr. Altman) researching his latest project; the head housemaid (Emily Watson), whose affair with Sir William is common knowledge though never spoken of; and Lady Sylvias aunt, the imperious Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), whose livelihood is dependent on the allowance that Sir William has threatened to take away. Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden called the film, for which Julian Fellowes won an Oscar for best screenplay, a melt-in-your-mouth hunk of 12-layer English spice cake.",2014-01-27T05:18:00+0000

One deportee, now an adult, recalls that he was told, at 10, that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents  mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit  were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreyss 1994 book, Empty Cradles.",2014-01-28T06:00:01+0000

Immigration authorities are preparing to return most of the crew members to North Korea. But the captain, first officer and political officer will remain in Panama and face arms trafficking charges. Panamanian officials indicated in October that most of the crew would be released, but the prosecutors office completed its investigation only this week. The seizure of the freighter, the 450-foot Chong Chon Gang, near the Panama Canal caused a diplomatic quarrel among Panama, Cuba and North Korea. A United Nations Security Council committee has been investigating whether the shipment violated sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. ",2014-01-31T01:33:52+0000

Mr. Plummer stumbles beautifully, poignantly and often, leering and searching through a haze of memory or, with concern edged with panic, calling for a line, a line much as Richard III calls for a horse.

us,The Post-Hope Politics of House of Cards,"At 6:45 a.m. on a September day in Baltimore, when the heat was already loitering in the 80s and would eventually flirt with 100 degrees, Beau Willimon, the show runner for House of Cards, finished his first  or maybe second, or actually probably his third  cigarette of the day and stalked onto the shows outdoor set. Every set of a TV show is a little reminiscent of a ragged Civil War camp, with its provisional tents and huddled groups of conferring higher-ups and wandering assistants tending to disparate needs. But on the House of Cards set  temporarily erected in a small park adjacent to a block of Baltimore townhouses  this feeling was heightened by the presence of Willimon, with his facial hair that might be best described as sort-of mutton chops; his beeline intensity; and, of course, that name: Beau Willimon, which seems perfectly suited to a brass plaque in the South somewhere, commemorating a particularly brave or foolhardy general. His hair was an unkempt pompadour, and he wore an untucked work shirt, unlaced work boots and jeans with a back pocket so tattered that it barely cradled his wallet, a situation that at least three people, including me, felt moved to warn him about it, though he waved each of us off in turn.

In the decades since, that nebulous term has been interpreted to mean a lively variety of repertory programs, retrospectives and, in the last few years, even first-run releases. While the annual festival has thrived, the fortunes of this nonprofit society have ebbed and flowed. In 2011, the organization expanded its footprint with the addition of the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center. But the society also recently underwent a leadership shake-up, its second in three years, and its year-round offerings face stiff competition from other screens around the city and online.

These are snapshots, not longitudinal documentaries, but in the way of good snapshots, they tell more than one might notice at first glance, and they allow for cautious universalizing.

Ian McEwan began a short story noting the peculiar smell asparagus lends the urine (it suggests sexual activity of some kind between exotic creatures). Martin Amis spent large parts of his early career detailing his characters bleeding gums and cracked molars. Will Selfs books come so awash in bodily fluids that if you were to throw them against a wall theyd most likely stick. Male self-disgust, rooted in the moist tumult of adolescence, and extended into ones 20s and 30s under cover of literary careers aping the clinical imperturbability of Nabokov and Joyce, has almost bequeathed us its own genre.

Returning home, he underwent scores of surgeries and in 2006 married his sweetheart in Illinois. The marriage didnt last, and Ziegel died in December 2012. But nobody who saw the Marine Wedding series will be able to forget him  or the damage wrought by war on his body, his life and his family.

Readers of even passing acquaintance with the Vietnam War will most likely know of Jeremiah Dentons televised 1966 interview  one of the first glimpses of the life of United States military pilots who had been shot down and captured. American viewers watched in horror and puzzlement as Denton, an emaciated, hunched figure dressed in gray prison garb, defiantly telegraphed the word t-o-r-t-u-r-e by blinking out the letters in Morse code. His brave act was followed by yet more torture, and some time later Vietnamese authorities bundled him along with 10 other men out of the infamous Hanoi Hilton, as Hoa Lo prison in the North Vietnamese capital was known (and where John McCain, probably the most famous P.O.W. of the war, would be held).
