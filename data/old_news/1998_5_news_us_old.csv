As in ''Tom and Viv,'' there is the sense that a literary legend (T. S. Eliot) has come alive, however tenderly, to teach the audience a sort of lesson.",1998-05-01T05:00:00+0000

Based on the landmark 1971 document of American cultural disequilibrium that was written by Hunter S. Thompson and illustrated by Mr. Steadman, the film stars Johnny Depp as Mr. Thompson's alter ego, Raoul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro as his partner-in-lunacy, Dr. Gonzo, who go on a drug- and alchohol-fueled jaunt into the desert in a crimson convertible. To capture the 2 1/2-hour conversation, which careered from topic to topic -- the movie, the book, art, film, old times, drugs and the idiosyncrasies of Mr. Thompson -- Mr. Steadman set up four tape recorders and a video recorder.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Lives Not Quite Lived,"Sudden death and early loss haunt the characters in Douglas Hobbie's sorrow-filled third novel, THIS TIME LAST YEAR (John Macrae/Holt, $23). Henry Ash, grieving for the loss of his daughter (a young woman who died from a lingering disease with slow and savage self-awareness), is spending the summer alone in Vermont. Henry's summer project is a study of Melville, Whitman and Dickinson entitled ''Loners.'' In his spare time, he reads James's novel of renunciation, ''The Ambassadors.'' His second wife, Elizabeth, while traveling in England, struggles to reconcile herself to the prospect of sharing Henry's grim new reality. In Vermont, Henry lives in a house once inhabited in body and now in spirit by Fitz, a man who was afraid to live his own life fully and who was felled before he could realize his best intentions. Also vacationing in Vermont is Helen, a book editor from New York who has recovered physically, but perhaps not emotionally, from breast cancer surgery. The lives not lived by the characters in this novel, like the lives not lived by the American eccentrics whose work Henry reads, call out for redress. While most of the narrative is told in Henry's constrained prose, some of it is reported in Fitz's confessional journal, in Elizabeth's detached postcards and in Helen's urgent telephone calls. Sadness, loneliness and loss have many voices. Yet all the voices in this carefully controlled and beautifully balanced novel fairly shout one message -- carpe diem.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; He Made the Whole World Listen,"The invention of the telephone is one of the most celebrated events in American history, but rarely have inventor and invention been better served than in the 400 illustrations, many of them Bell family photos, assembled by Edwin S. Grosvenor and Morgan Wesson in ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL: The Life and Times of the Man Who Invented the Telephone (Abrams, $45). Bell devoted his life to working with the deaf -- both his mother and his wife had hearing impairments -- and it was his knowledge of the shapes of sound waves, rather than any mechanical genius, that led him to the essential principle of telephony: that an undulating electrical current could mimic the subtle changes in amplitude and frequency that make up human speech. Patent No. 174,465 for ''improvements in telegraphy'' is often called the most valuable patent ever issued, but it opened Bell to more than 600 legal challenges -- the price of holding out against the communications giant of his day, Western Union. Bell went on to invent versions of the metal detector, Dictaphone, iron lung, and flat-disk phonograph record. He experimented in helicopter design and X-ray photography. In between, he edited the National Geographic, looked after the Smithsonian, mentored Helen Keller and very nearly scooped the Wright Brothers on the airplane -- but, characteristically, then generously conceded and praised their accomplishment. Watching Bell advance from childhood to old age in these photographs, one is struck by his openness and serenity, in public as much as in private, and even in glimpses of failed experiments. ''In scientific researches there are no unsuccessful experiments,'' Bell once wrote; Grosvenor, his great-grandson, and Wesson, a film producer, make plain not only the range of Bell's accomplishments, though that was amazing enough, but how consistently they depended upon qualities in his character: to watch, to listen, to understand.David Walton",1998-05-03T05:00:00+0000

Color and character are agreed upon and cleanly projected. Pianissimos can be extraordinary, as in the haunting note-by-note buildup of the chord that starts the slow movement of Opus 135.",1998-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Currents; LOFTS -- Where Romantic Triangles Happen,"The plot of the new movie ''Two Girls and a Guy,'' a modern tale of romantic triage written and directed by James Toback, delves deep into the wherefores of lust, loyalty, betrayal and inexorable affection. But it never answers the question foremost on the mind of any sane New Yorker: Where did the guy get that spectacular apartment? The SoHo loft where two girlfriends come together to confront their boyfriend has majestic 14-foot ceilings with Corinthian cast iron columns, a shoji screen-enshrined bedroom and a Jacuzzi with a 10-foot window. Almost every review has cited the place: ''lavish'' (The New York Post), ''to die for'' (The New York Observer) or ''the colorful, fourth character'' (The New York Times). The film's main character, a hapless actor, would never have been able to buy the place, which is made clear when one woman insults him as ''loft inheriting.'' But the real-estate insatiable may want to know more. The Leonard Street loft was designed by its owner, Roberto Brambilla, an Italian architect. Movie scouts found the loft after inspecting more than 150 others. They added touches like a ''Jules et Jim'' movie poster and subtracted some personal effects (a huge screen of Lake Como is not visible, but the neo-classical sleigh bed that Mr. Brambilla slept in as a child is). Why did the architect allow a film crew into his home? ''They were very nice to me,'' he said, ''and frankly seemed so desperate. So I took pity and invited them over.'' That and a hefty location fee did the trick.",1998-05-07T05:00:00+0000

The offer of $41 a share or 2.4 Call-Net nonvoting shares for each Fonorola share is equal to $1.1 billion.

Phillip, along with his brother and sister-in-law, Max and Frieda (z''l), and his family, has contributed immeasurably to the growth and development of BarIlan. The benefactor of several important campus facilities, including the Stollman Dormitory, Stollman Administration Building, Stollman Laboratory Floor in the Cancer Research Building, and the Stollman Garden, he and his family have supported Bar-Ilan's Exodus Scholarship program, the Slomovitz Program in Public Communication, and the University's Cancer, Aids and immunology Research (CAIR) Institute. Phillip Stollman was the first and longtime chairman of the University's Global Board of Trustees, an honorary chairman for several decades more, a Bar-llan Presidential Founder, and the recipient of an honorary doctorate degree from the University. His commitment to Israel and the Jewish people was reflected in his involvement with myriad Jewish causes and as a leader in his home community of Detroit, MI. His legacy of leadership, sterling philanthropic spirit, gentle speech and compassionate nature will inspire generations to come. We express heartfelt condolences to his son and daughter-in-law, Dr. Gerald and Leila Stollman, his daughters Shirley, Annette and Rochelle, his nephew and niece, Bernard and Barbara Stollman, as well as to his numerous grandchildren, greatgrandchildren and other beloved family members.

Yet looking back at that bittersweet year of 1998, when scientists first disclosed that cocoa farms, the source for the world's supply of chocolate, were under siege from fungal and viral diseases and insects, the future looked dark indeed. Visions of deprivation, rationing and the gradual disappearance of chocolate gave rise to a burst of dystopian fervor in film, literature, music and computer art. Global morale sank under the weight of chocolate substitutes. Even today, the memory of carob kisses and solid licorice Easter bunnies causes an involuntary shudder in all who lived through those bleak times.",1998-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Into the Heart of Haiti,"Although it was the first black nation to free itself from the shackles of European colonialism, Haiti has yet to come to terms with itself as a nation. In the course of Lilas Desquiron's strange yet insistently powerful novel, REFLECTIONS OF LOKO MIWA (University Press of Virginia, cloth, $55; paper, $16.95), the storms of repression, betrayal and prejudice that have buffeted this country virtually since its independence are memorably drawn -- and just as memorably left unresolved. The story is told through the lives of two women, raised together as ''sisters,'' who become 20th-century representatives of the pervasive oppositions that have tormented their homeland since it was liberated from France in 1804. Cocotte, a black woman from the countryside, is separated from her impoverished family as a child and spends her youth trying to establish her identity. Violaine, a light-skinned mulatto of privilege and station whose violent passions become the novel's focus, feels that her ''African soul suffers in a body that's too pale for it,'' even though she belongs to a family determined ''to repress all traces of its African heritage.'' Translated into conversational English by Robin Orr Bodkin, ''Reflections of Loko Miwa'' (the title refers to a spirit that protects healers and twins) is an intense social, political and magical voyage into the heart of Haiti. At the end of that journey lie death and transcendence as the warring saints of voodoo and Christianity intermingle to determine Violaine's destiny. Ironically, despite their best efforts, her fate is finally decided by a whim -- and a slingshot. James Polk",1998-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Wilde Thing,"''Somehow or other I'll be famous,'' Oscar Wilde told a friend when he was an undergraduate at Oxford, ''and if not famous, notorious.'' He became both -- first as the deliberately outrageous exponent of estheticism, caricatured in Punch and lampooned by Gilbert and Sullivan; later as the brilliantly witty playwright whose work mocked and subverted all the easy pieties of Victorian England. He became a social lion, the dazzling talker every London hostess clamored to have at her table. Then came scandal and ruin: in love with Lord Alfred Douglas, petulant, beautiful son of the Marquess of Queensberry, Wilde allowed himself to be talked into a lawsuit against the brutish Marquess that eventually landed him and not Queensberry in prison. In the 98 years since Wilde's death, his story has been recounted by everyone from the man who ruined him to the distinguished scholar Richard Ellmann. Now Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson, has published THE WILDE ALBUM (Holt, $19.95), which brings together hundreds of images of Wilde and his circle, accompanied by a biographical text. Some of the photographs have never been published before; others are classics of Wildeiana, like the studio shots of a dreamy, languorous young Wilde, in a fur-lined coat, velvet jacket and knee breeches, taken during his triumphant lecture tour in the United States (where he famously told a customs officer that he had nothing to declare but his genius, and won over the miners of Leadville, Colo., by drinking with them). Holland has no dramatic revelations or bold new theories to offer, but his narrative serves to remind us all over again of what an extraordinary man his grandfather was -- and how much he influenced the art of the 20th century.

Wilde's own life proved what he was saying. That is one reason that in New York at this moment you can see three dramatic portraits of Oscar Wilde -- the new film, called ''Wilde,'' starring Stephen Fry; the play by David Hare called ''The Judas Kiss,'' starring Liam Neeson, and the Off Broadway play, called ''Gross Indecency,'' by Moises Kaufman.",1998-05-11T05:00:00+0000

Was a rare human being who exuded brilliance, strength, generosity and a dry northern Irish sense of humor throughout his life, even in the face of terminal illness. He died of cancer at home with beloved family on May 13, 1998. Born in Belfast Northern Ireland in 1936, he was a graduate of Queens University and received his Ph.D. in psychology and statistics at The Institute of Psychiatry at London University. He worked for and with the renowned psychologist, Hans Eysenck at The London University Hospital of Psychiatry at Maudsley. Ken, who rarely referred to himself as Dr. Kenneth M. Warwick, was best known as an eminent expert in statistical research for the marketing industry. A Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and member of Econometric Society, he was internationally known to be among preeminent statisticians. Ken Warwick & Associates, Inc., specializing in multivariate statistical analysis, consults in advertising, corporate management consulting and market research businesses, and in the legal system and government. As he hoped, his distinguished partner continues his reputation through her expertise. His company has always been a part of his family. His prior career included positions as Associate Research Director and Vice President at SSC&B and Grey Advertising. He was an Executive Vice President of a pioneering market research company. He taught at London, Columbia, and New York Universities. For years he has been an Editor of the Journal of Marketing Research and has written numerous articles on marketing and psychological research. He has been a speaker at and active with The American Marketing Association, The Advertising Research Foundation, The American Psychological Association and The Association of Consumer Research. Ken has contributed to the Partnership For A Drug-Free America, a part of his extensive pro bono work. Dr. Warwick is a recognized authority on the use of multivariate statistical procedures in business research and has initiated the implementation of many methods on digital computers. He has developed numerous proprietary techniques. Ken co-authored the book ''Multivariate Descriptive Statistical Analysis'' with the distinguished Ludovic Lebart and Alain Morineau and has been credited for initiating the use of correspendence analysis from France in American marketing research. Ken and his colleague and friend, Alan Hendrickson, started Cybernetics Research Consultants, a groundbreaking computer statistical analysis co. in Britain. Ken's zest for knowledge and inexhaustible drive for work and excellence were only surpassed by his love for his family. He encouraged and nurtured his children with strong work ethics, empowerment for achievement, zeal for learning, and love for family. His pride in and support for his children was an inextricable part of his nature. This giving spirit, characteristic of his entire family is his legacy. Ken is survived by his wife, Jane Chicoine Warwick, four children, Dr. Zoe Warwick Forsyth, John Alexander Warwick, Alan Warwick, and Richard Warwick; three grandchildren, Daniel, Ryan, and Eric and twins expected in June. His three rescued cats and dog are just one manifestation of love for animals. In lieu of flowers the family suggests that contributions be made according to his wish to The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or an organization reputed for animal humaneness.

Cohan, Cary Grant, George Jessel, Joe E. Lewis, Dean Martin, Ed Sullivan and Mike Todd, and, like them, he shared a legacy of commitment to the very best.

''It's sexy without being slutty, and she makes really elegant cuts,'' Ms. Posey said. When it's time for a fitting, Ms. Jimenez treats a woman like a wrapped piece of art. It is a hands-on-body experience -- her hands, your body. ''I lay the fabric down on the floor, you lie down on it, and I measure you,'' Ms. Jimenez said. She makes patterns in the jersey fabrics by burning holes to create laciness (as shown in the dress here). Finally, she sews each garment by hand, using transparent 60-pound monofilament fishing line. Six one-of-a-kind items, from a shawl to a gown ($500 to $1,000) are sold at Linda Dresner, 484 Park Avenue (58th Street).

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  LOVELL, FRANK","LOVELL-Frank. A prominent socialist writer and author on trade union issues, died in New York City May 1 of a heart attack at the age of 84. He had lived in Manhattan for the past thirty years. Attracted to a revolutionary and democratic variety of socialism often associated with the Socialist Party of Eugene V. Debs and the militant Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as well as the idealism of the early Communist movement, Lovell became part of the small international movement led by Leon Trotsky known as the Fourth International. His political commitment and analytical insight were widely appreciated in left-wing and labor circles-as were his warmth, avid intellectual curiosity, adroit sense of humor, and engaging interest in persons of all ages and backgrounds. He was born on July 24, 1913, in Ipava, Illinois, a farming town where his father was a local entrepreneur. In the early 1930's Lovell attended the University of California's radical Berkeley campus, earning a Bachelor's Degree in philosophy. He was drawn into the socialist movement just after the San Francisco general strike, joining the Workers Party of the United States, led by James P. Cannon and A.J. Muste, in 1935. He consequently became a seaman and an organizer for the Sailor's Union of the Pacific. In 1938, Lovell was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party, & for many years played a leading role in that organization, especially as a trade union activist. For a number of years he served on national leadership bodies of the SWP. He wrote extensively for socialist publications on labor issues and other matters, and under the pen-name Frederick Lang wrote a classic-''Maritime!'' (New York: Pioneer Publishers, 1943). In Portland, Oregon in the late 1940s he edited ''The Defender'', a rankand-file paper opposing the conservatism and anti-left purges triumphing throughout the maritime industry and unions. In the early 1950s Frank moved to Detroit with his wife Sarah and their infant daughter, Joan. There he became an auto worker and a member of the United Auto Workers. With close friends, George & Dorothea Breitman, Frank and Sarah played an especially significant role in the Detroit labor and socialist movements of the 1950s and 1960s. They initiated and maintained for many years the influential Friday Night Socialist Forum (later called the Militant Forum), a weekly series tht drew a broad range of prominent trade unionists and workingclass militants, civil rights and black liberation activists, scholars, intellectuals, students and others. They also ran openly socialist electoral campaigns-such as Frank's campaigns for Governor of Michigan on the SWP ticket in 1954, 1958 and 1964. In the late 1960s they moved to New York City, where Frank served as the Socialist Workers Party's trade union director. Expelled with hundreds of others from the SWP in the early 1980s, Lovell initiated publication of ''Bulletin In Defense Of Marxism'' in December of 1983. He served as first editor of this magazine, and later on its Editorial Board. (Before her death in 1994, Sarah Lovell played a central role as the magazine's treasurer and chief copy editor.) In Frank's final years he was also active in the Metro New York Labor Party and worked effectively to secure financial support for the Ernest Mandel Institute in Brussels, Belgium and the Leon Trotsky Museum at Coyoacan in Mexico City. Frank Lovell is survived by his dear companion, Miriam Braverman, of Manhattan; his beloved daughter, Joan Lovell, and son-in-law Mark Weiss, of Detroit, Michigan; his sisters-in-law, Mollie Kerchner, of Delray, Florida, and Josephine Lovell of California; his longtime friend and comrade, Dorethea Breitman, also of Manhattan. He will be fondly remembered by the many people whose lives he touched with his generous spirit.

We have both intensified and elongated what used to be a simple biological transition, and have turned it into an arduous rite of cultural passage. To say that kids nowadays grow up too fast is a truism; it's equally true that we have made such a fetish of youth that not only adolescents but also many of us ostensible grown-ups dwell in a perpetual state of immaturity. But as an arbitrary cutoff, 13 has the virtue of standing at the beginning of what continues to be the heart of the journey -- the teen-age years -- and as these photographs amply document, 13 is the age that may most vividly embody all the paradoxes and contrasts of adolescence. These kids are still recognizably children, even as they are also premature grown-ups. Sometimes they're both at once -- children trying to act grown-up -- and sometimes you sense a younger self clinging forlornly to an older one. Many of the kids seem to be in a state of constant transition, slipping back and forth from one extreme to the other, as in Lauren Greenfield's pictures of suburban girls getting ready for a party in Edina, Minn.

The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West.''

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; A Poet's Environment,"As an epigraph to his book JOSEPH BRODSKY/LENINGRAD: Fragments (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35), the photographer Mikhail Lemkhin has chosen the late Russian poet's own words, from his tribute to Stephen Spender: ''People are what we remember about them. . . . With death, it gets unstitched, and one ends up with random, disjointed fragments. With shards or, if you will, with snapshots.'' Of the 186 photographs included here, some are of Brodsky -- reading, smiling, wiping his face, smoking -- and some are of Leningrad (as it was called from 1924 to 1991), the poet's native city. Lemkhin identifies a few of the places in the photographs in random notes -- the Alexandrine Column in Palace Square, the sphinx on the embankment of the Neva River, apartments Brodsky lived in, the Leningrad headquarters of the K.G.B., the prison where Brodsky was incarcerated, Dostoyevsky's tombstone -- but most of the photographs of Leningrad are not so grand or specific. Instead, there are universal scenes of children playing in the snow; busy, crowded streets; people leaning out the windows of their apartment buildings or sitting on park benches. There are no close-up portraits of people, however, other than those of Brodsky. ''Rather than a collection of images,'' Lemkhin writes in a brief note at the end, '' 'Fragments' is a single portrait. Each photo is like a word or a phrase I use to tell my story, to sketch my subject's portrait.'' Enriched by Czeslaw Milosz's foreword and by Susan Sontag's moving, elegiac afterword, Lemkhin has successfully -- and beautifully -- arranged the many shards of his book into that whole, single portrait to which he aspired.

''The aspirin acts as an astringent and squeezes the hair follicle, causing the hair to exit the pores and straighten out so it can be cut off or removed by waxing or electrolysis,'' explained Doug Keeling, sales manager of the Tend Skin Company in Davies, Fla.

us,Children's Books in Brief; Bananas With Everything,"Anthony Browne's hero in Willy the Dreamer (Candlewick, $16.99; ages 3 and up) is a mild, unassuming chimpanzee with a marvelous imagination. When Willy falls asleep in his easy chair, we are invited to visit his fabulous dream world. Here we see some odd dreams familiar to all of us -- you try to run but your feet stick to the ground, or you feel all out of proportion, way too large or too small for your surroundings. In this book, the fifth about Willy, we visit his daydreams as he wonders what it might be like to be a beggar or a king. And we share Willy's memories of his infancy and his fantasies of his future life as a father. In one picture, Browne, a British artist with an international reputation, makes it clear that Willy's dreams are all vivid and exciting, but the people watching television are pale and expressionless. The simple text provides a minimal accompaniment to the gorgeous watercolor paintings. There are beautifully subtle underwater scenes; lush, exotic jungles; and bizarre, surreal landscapes. And running through the books is a hilarious banana motif, with bananas serving some ingenious function on every page. While young readers are busy searching for bananas in disguise, grown-ups will enjoy identifying the artists and writers to whom Browne pays homage, finding the influences of Dali, Magritte, Henri Rousseau, Lewis Carroll, Robert Louis Stevenson and others displayed with great wit. This is a wonderful and thought-provoking book, encouraging us to take a moment, close our eyes, and see what we can see. Robin Tzannes",1998-05-17T05:00:00+0000

It was part of his own history; one of his songs can be found on the newly available 1968 album called ''Tropicalia,'' a collaborative document that includes the other musicians and composers central to the movement like Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Rogerio Duprat and the band Os Mutantes (the Mutants).",1998-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Redemption at the Auto Show,"Words take on uncommon qualities in the poet Diane Glancy's brief new novel, FLUTIE (Moyer Bell, $18.95). The title character is an adolescent girl, part Cherokee and part German, who is so plagued by anxiety and shyness that she can barely speak. Meanwhile, ''her mother shot words that hit her. Flutie picked them up from the floorboard and put them in her mouth. She chewed the brass casing of a cartridge.'' Glancy's prose is studded with such moments, in which metaphors solidify into physical objects. Flutie is said to have thrown her tongue into a pond when she stopped speaking -- and, in the context of the mystical Oklahoma landscape that surrounds her, it seems natural enough that the severed tongue then swam away like a fish. The novel's plot is almost impossibly spare, but the impoverished existence of Flutie's family and the difficulties imposed by its mingled ancestry are so richly detailed that the reader quickly comes to understand Flutie's solipsistic, dysfunctional and sometimes euphoric state of mind. At an auto show, for example, she senses a redemptive bridge between the clouds, where her mind so often dwells, and the daily sensation of speeding along the highway: ''There was transformation. There was hope. Cars were the angels of America. They were full of invisible wings. Chevys. Fords. Plymouths. Buicks. Studebakers. Restored. Rebuilt. Customized. Polished. Worshiped.'' It is surprising images like these that make Glancy's account of Flutie's world so unexpectedly satisfying. Elizabeth Gaffney",1998-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Fragments Make the Man,"The presiding voice in Milena McGraw's first novel, AFTER DUNKIRK (Houghton Mifflin, $24), belongs to Flying Officer Wayne Luthie. He is 20 years old and describes himself as ''a just man in a just war.'' From the fragments of his stream-of-consciousness narration, we learn that he was born in the Punjab in 1919, that he spent his childhood there and his youth in England, that he grew into manhood at Dunkirk. His experiences flying with the R.A.F. and falling in love with a gentle English war widow dominate his memories, which arise (perhaps unbidden) in vivid flashes of language. Over and over, he repeats, ''I am a man who loves words.'' He demonstrates this in sequences of haunting revelations: ''I want to fly without killing people.'' ''A human being burning to death sounds like a piece of bacon frying.'' ''I do not want a woman to gentle my wounds. I do not want a woman to be repelled by my wounds.'' ''My father the pacifist gave me a knife.'' These bursts of language eventually organize themselves into stories -- unbearable stories of loss, pain, horror, humiliation and death. ''Things repeat themselves: the same, yet different; different, yet the same,'' Luthie explains near the end of the novel. For this narrator, repetition is an attempt to understand, organize and master intolerable events. For the reader, repetition allows these events to come into an increasingly sharper and shapelier focus. More important, repetition starkly and unsentimentally displays the desperate gyrations of Luthie's tortured mind. Barbara Fisher",1998-05-24T05:00:00+0000

The ''Brain'' collection reports on such aspects of mentality as memory, perception, sex differences in the brain and the neurological machinery of emotion; the final selection is happily entitled ''The Conscious Mind Is Still Baffling to Experts of All Stripes.''",1998-05-24T05:00:00+0000

The impact of Judd's work, not only as an artist and an architect but also as a designer of furniture and household objects, has lately resonated far and wide, as fashion has come around to the stripped-down esthetic -- popularly known as minimalism -- that he helped pioneer. On this occasion, some 600 people made the pilgrimage to Marfa, the town where Judd settled; the Chinati Foundation, which sponsored the event, turned away 400 more. Even so, the notion that Marfa -- population 2,424 -- might prove to be ''the next happening place,'' in the words of one resident, seemed highly unlikely for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that it's smack in the middle of nowhere: 90 minutes into the three-hour drive from the airport in El Paso, you run out of radio stations.",1998-05-24T05:00:00+0000

We recall his love of opera, particularly his commitment to 20th century opera and the French repertory. His extraordinary patronage leaves a legacy of 16 Met productions. In addition to his annual patronage, Francis Goelet enabled the Metropolitan Opera to present the world's premiers of three operas by American composers-''Vanessa'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra'' by Samuel Barber and ''The Ghost of Versailles'' by John Corigliano. His interest in the French repertory is represented by his gifts of the new productions and revivals of ''Les Troyens'', Samson et Dalila'', Pelleas et Melisande'', Dialogue of the Carmelites'', ''Parade'', Les Contes d'Hoffman'', and a concert version of ''The Damnation of Faust''. His commitment to young opera artists is represented by his gifts to our Young Artists Development Program, through the Kathryn T. Long Trust, where he served as the principal trustee. All of us who were privileged to know Frank, will remember his friendship with deep affection. His service to the arts, especially music and opera, will be a singular inspiration for future generations. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and his friends.

From Pol Pot's corpse laid out in a jungle hut to the debris of tornado-wrecked houses in Alabama, A.P. images are part of our daily fare. Since the cooperative started in 1848, technological advances have transformed news transmission into an instantaneous electronic process. But gathering the material from wars, natural disasters, and social and political upheavals remains arduous and often dangerous. Six A.P. staff members have been killed on duty during this decade alone. FLASH! The Associated Press Covers the World (The Associated Press/Abrams, $39.95) celebrates the news service's 150th anniversary with 170 photographs, introduced by the war correspondent Peter Arnett. Some of the images are among the world's best known, like Joe Rosenthal's picture of marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima during World War II. Vietnam yielded Eddie Adams's shot of the impromptu execution of a suspected Vietcong member and Huynh Cong Ut's horrific image of burned children fleeing napalm. Most images reproduced here reach for a peak moment, whether of a fiery crash or a perfect dive. So many diverse images make for a rather disjointed and unsatisfying book, and its pedestrian layout does nothing to enhance its photos. Nonetheless, the book does record much of the fury and folly of the 20th century and pays tribute to the intrepid photographers who showed up to record the spectacle.

Mr. Quirin was born in New York City on April 26, 1911 the son of Lewis and Bertha Krepps Quirin. He has lived in Old Lyme for the past 25 years and was formerly from New York City where he was the former chairman and president of Frederic R. Harris, Inc. He joined the firm in 1939; 12 years after it was founded by Rear Admiral Frederic R. Harris, retired Chief of the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Yards and Docks. He rose to lead the firm shortly after the Admiral's death in 1949 and oversaw a period of unprecedented growth and diversification. Originally focused predominantly on ports and marine work, he quickly steered the company into other sectors such as highways, mass transit and oil industry related facilities. Harris became global in its business operations, securing assignments in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia. Harris became one of the first true multinational corporations, creating joint companies in many countries including Turkey, Iran, Spain, Italy and Venezuela. Under Mr. Quirin's leadership, the firm secured and performed some of the world's largest projects of the late 1950's and early 1960's including the design and construction management of a program to build U.S. military bases in Spain; the Kharg Island Oil Terminal in Iran and the Inner Ring Road project in Antwerp, Belgium, for which he received an award from the Belgian Government. Mr. Quirin, who retired from the firm in 1972, held a Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. After retirement, he served for two years as president of his alma mater and was also president of the Board of Directors of the Knickerbocker Hospital in New York City. He was a licensed Professional Engineer in several states as well as an accomplished writer, having authored several articles on dry docks for the Encyclopedia Americana. He was a member of Christ the King Church in Old Lyme, a past president and life trustee of the Connecticut River Museum in Essex and was a partner in the engineering consulting firm of Besier, Gibble and Quirin in Old Saybrook, CT. He married Margaret M. O'Hara in New York City on December 16, 1972. In addition to his wife he is survived by two daughters: Barbara Ann Badran of Cambridge, Maryland and Eleanor Catherine Loss of Los Angeles, California, a sister Louise Spahn of Oneonta, New York, four grandchildren and one greatgrandson. He was predeceased by a brother, Karl Quirin and a sister Betty Kelly. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 11:00 A.M. on Wednesday, May 27, 1998 at Christ the King Church.

He earned a B.A. degree from UCLA and later studied playwriting and directing in graduate school. From 1951-1955, he served in the U.S. Air Force as a Russian language specialist. After marrying Ruth Greene in 1955, he began a career in advertising and marketing with American Standard and then as Vice President with Schieffelin & Co. After retirement, he devoted his attention to civic and church activities. He served on the Board of Directors of the Westchester Mental Health Association, the Mt. Kisco Food Pantry, and the Chappaqua Drama Group. He was a longtime member of the Rotary Club for which he served as past President of District 7230. He was also a Paul Harris Fellow.

He was wellknown locally for his bi-weekly column for The Patent Trader.

The offices are empty now, furniture upended, ready for storage. ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' a brilliant, lacerating situation comedy about a fictitious late-night talk-show host and the complications, both emotional and professional, of his show-biz life, filmed its last episode, the one Shandling is now editing, a month ago. The key to ''Sanders,'' which completes its sixth season on HBO tonight, has been tension and longing, the way the characters bumped up against one another in their quest for some sort of intangible sense of acceptance and glory. The show was born out of the Leno-Letterman, man-who-would-be-Johnny talk-show wars, and Shandling, a stand-up comedian who had been a guest host for Carson during the mid-80's, saw the backstage whirl as emblematic of larger desires in American culture. ''The whole world is show business now,'' he explains, still concentrating on the editing terminal. ''Everyone wants to be famous. They think being famous will change their life. I'm here to tell them that it doesn't.''",1998-05-31T05:00:00+0000

Readers may giggle at the sight of recipes for brandied cheese roll and three-ingredient peanut meringues, wax nostalgic over instructions for (updated) pot roast and chocolate angel food cake -- and then find themselves heading to the kitchen, inspired by a dish that looks approachable and appealing. After all, this chatty book's title trumpets ease of preparation, and many of its selections can be assembled ahead of time, then refrigerated or frozen for later cooking. ''Breezy'' barbecued chicken, zesty and tangy, is a cinch to execute, as are the delicious Maryland crab cakes and the braised fennel, lusciously partnered with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Brownies are ubiquitous in American cookbooks, but Burros and Levine's rendition, elevated with Grand Marnier, orange zest, coffee extract and pecans, stands out in the crowd. Not everything is such a knockout: curried rice salad, bound with nonfat yogurt and light mayonnaise, is so stodgy it appears to have come straight from Ozzie and Harriet's kitchen. And no matter how good it might taste, no one short of a restaurant pastry chef is likely to tackle an ''easy'' recipe for chocolate cake that spans four pages. Helpfully, the authors include a set of 10 different menus, complete with shopping lists and detailed game plans, along with suggestions for dishes that can be whipped up for, say, ''unexpected guests.'' Here's just the push a reluctant cook might need to turn on the stove and do some entertaining. (P.S. Laugh if you will, but the peanut meringues are addictive.)
