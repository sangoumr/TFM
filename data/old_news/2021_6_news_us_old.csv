He opened it just four years ago with Jean-Georges Vongerichten as its marquee chef. Now he is introducing a Peruvian star, Diego Muoz, to New York to create the food at Popular, the new signature restaurant on the property, and also to oversee the adjacent Cantina & Pisco Bar. Among Mr. Muozs credits are the kitchens of Astrid y Gastn in Lima, Peru, and the Edition in Bodrum, Turkey, another Schrager hotel, as well as other projects in Peru. Working alongside Mr. Muoz will be John Fraser, another chef in Mr. Schragers lineup, who will attend mainly to the restaurant management side of things. Mr. Schrager noted that this collaboration of two top chefs was something he has never done. Mr. Fraser will also curate the prepared grab-and-go items, including some by Mr. Muoz, at Louis, a ground-floor market and coffee bar. The Cantina & Pisco Bar is a pair of marble counters, one with fresh fish on display for ceviche made to order, the other for cocktails starring pisco. There is also table seating. Popular has indoor and outdoor seating for a menu highlighting the multicultural traditions  African, Chinese, Incan, Italian, Japanese and Spanish   that shape Peruvian cuisine in many seafood preparations, and also in dishes like papa a la Huancana, a classic Peruvian potato dish; filet mignon saltado, a dressier version of the staple; salmon tiradito for the Japanese influence; and wood-smoked seafood paella, plus the inevitable burger. There are three wood ovens. On the Cantina & Pisco Bar menu will be razor clams, and hearts of palm with avocado. Louis will offer a ceviche bowl, Peruvian-style sandwiches and also a loaded Chrystie Street kosher hot dog; Mr. Muoz will be coming up with cocktails at Cantina and Popular, many based on pisco, the grape spirit of Peru. Peruvian and South American selections dominate the wine list. (Opens June 12; reservations accepted from June 5.)",2021-06-01T18:16:56+0000

It was a Black city. Following the Watts Rebellion  the uprisings that took place in August 1965 in the predominantly Black Watts neighborhood, just north of Compton in southern Los Angeles  white residents who hadnt already left the area were desperate to get out. By the end of that decade, Comptons population, which had previously been mostly white, was about 70 percent Black. The difference between Compton in 1959 and in 1969 is almost like night and day, says Robert Lee Johnson, a local historian. When the city elected Douglas Dollarhide, its first Black mayor, in 1969, he came into office with a majority Black school board and an entirely Black City Council. But keeping the city middle class was an uphill battle. The mass relocation of white-owned businesses led to sweeping job losses and soon Compton, which had formerly been known for its housing and schools, Johnson says, couldnt afford to maintain either, let alone support the arts.",2021-06-01T18:51:19+0000

Hiding from the virus, in any case, was more reasonable than hiding from the ceiling or the refrigerator, as he would often suggest to me then, or from the Bible or Shakespeares complete works, as I would suggest to him. So we huddled under the table and screamed fake screams of fear  fake because they were whispered imitations of screams, and also because the fear was fake, in theory, though at that moment I did feel fear.

us,"New Audiobooks From Seth Rogen, Danielle Henderson and Elon Green","The only thing more essential to a road trip than an audiobook is gas. I often spend as much time selecting the listening material for a long drive as I do mapping the itinerary, and Ive seldom made a better choice than LAST CALL: A TRUE STORY OF LOVE, LUST, AND MURDER IN QUEER NEW YORK (Macmillan Audio, 8 hours, 11 minutes), by Elon Green. Recently, my husband and I listened to this true-crime stunner on a drive from North Carolina to New York, and the hours flew by as quickly as the landscape. In 1991, a Pennsylvania Turnpike maintenance worker opened an unusually heavy trash bag and found a mutilated body: It looked like a loaf of bread, he recalls, but then I saw freckles. The freckles belonged to a gay man, a divorced banker and father whod last been seen at a Midtown Manhattan piano bar called the Townhouse. Just over a year later, workers emptying trash cans at a rest stop in New Jersey found a bloody bag containing a human head. It belonged to a closeted gay man, a married father of four who had also last been seen at the Townhouse. These were the first known victims of the so-called Last Call Killer, who went on to murder at least two more gay men the next year. The nearly decade-long and sometimes bungled hunt for the serial murderer gives the book its suspense. Greens sensitive portraits of the victims, and his deeply researched re-creation of an epoch of gay history, provide its soul. Inherently shocking material needs no dramatization, and David Pittus understated narration highlights the tragedy and horror of these crimes. Last Call is the kind of book that keeps you wide awake all night turning the pages. As an audiobook, it will keep you wide awake all day as you drive, hoping you dont get wherever youre going before it ends.",2021-06-08T15:04:54+0000

Chefs had to deal with individual fishermen and it was complicated for them, but by aggregating we made it easier, said Jeff Tedmori, the chief executive and a graduate of MITs Sloan School of Management. He came up with the idea with his business partner and the chief operating officer Matthew Henderson, whose family has been in the fish business for generations. Soon after they saw that the fishermen on their roster could not do enough business with so many restaurants closed, they opened for consumer sales. They say most of their products are harvested to order and shipped within a day. What is especially appealing for those of us in the East is that they carry some West Coast varieties that we rarely see, like succulent petrale sole, California king salmon and live spot prawns.

The two had met the previous year as entry-level employees at Theo Waddington Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Though their day jobs were uptown, and they lived in a two-bedroom railroad apartment three blocks away, splitting the rent of $750, the pair shared a disinterest in the art they saw there  Waddington showed Fauvists and Inuit artists, while his neighbors were mainly gentlemanly dealers of old masters, Impressionists and male abstract painters. Pilkington and Olsoff were young, in their mid-20s, but they were also gutsy, no-nonsense and imaginative, and they began to fantasize about opening their own space together. They had traveled to the U.K., in part, to visit Pilkingtons parents, who ran Londons Piccadilly Gallery, which focused on turn-of-the-20th-century European art. But that summer day, as would happen both literally and figuratively at various points in their working relationship, they found themselves stranded at the side of the road. After looking under the cars hood, Olsoff recalls, Pilkington removed her stockings, as if this were a very normal thing to do, and tied them in place to create a makeshift replacement for the blown-out fan belt. It worked for just long enough to get to the next garage, Pilkington recalls. For Olsoff, it was a sign that they would always be able to get by.",2021-06-16T09:00:36+0000

His new neighbors had warned the multimedia producer about the nutty lady on the ninth floor  every building has one, they joked  with her querulous duo of pug dogs toted in a baby carriage, and nonstop pronouncements issued in an archaic highbrow accent straight out of The Philadelphia Story. Vaczy, then 36, was instantly enchanted. Growing up in a working-class Long Island family, he had been involved in the early 1980s punk scene and was familiar with Berlins lore of the Pop movement, though it took him a while to connect the dots, to figure out that the woman who lived four floors above him had starred in Andy Warhols films and was in his inner circle for more than 20 years. Vaczy knew her as the society girl manque who got fat expressly to spite a controlling mother, and who earned the nickname Brigid Polk at the Factory, Warhols studio, because she loved to poke herself  and anyone in the vicinity  with a hypodermic needle of amphetamines. She had always scoffed at the idea that she was an artist, but friends like Robert Rauschenberg and the sculptor John Chamberlain regarded her as an equal. John Waters once described her as big, often naked and ornery as hell. That afternoon at the elevator she asked Vaczy if he wanted to come up to her apartment for five minutes.

us,A Chef Looks Back on the Locavore Life,"Has it really been 10 years since Peter Hoffman closed Savoy, his steadfastly locavore gem on the edge of SoHo? Seems like yesterday. His new book, Whats Good?, is a lively memoir covering the arc of the restaurants life span, with plenty of detours into his suburban childhood; his culinary awakening; his wife and family; his interest in botany, plant genetics, biology and history; and the evolution of New Yorks restaurant world. He has reason to be proud of his farm-to-table approach early in the game that depended on the nearby Union Square Greenmarket. Each chapter features a different ingredient (14 of them total), which became highlights in the restaurant, with an appropriate recipe or two for each. Leeks figure prominently. The restaurant opened in 1990 and closed in 2011, a victim of economics and the changes in SoHo, and was always a work in progress, like Mr. Hoffmans own career. Back Forty and Back Forty West, his other places, had briefer runs. Mr. Hoffman says that he has no plans to open another New York restaurant. But another book? Thats possible.",2021-06-21T19:40:57+0000
