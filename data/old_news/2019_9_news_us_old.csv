A dictatorial party facing domestic and global pressures  especially from the ongoing trade negotiations with the United States  the C.C.P. is getting impatient, apparently. On Friday, it targeted leading activists and politicians in Hong Kong with a round of arrests, possibly signaling that a broader crackdown may be around the corner.",2019-09-01T00:34:39+0000

In the spirit of Labor Day, revisit this outrageous black comedy about three friends who, despite working hard, are repeatedly tormented by their bosses. Their simmering grievances reach a boiling point when the buddies  Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis)  decide to put an end to their misery by killing their higher-ups (played by Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell). Their scheme quickly falls off the rails, because, well, theyre not experienced killers. And the murder consultant (Jamie Foxx) they turn to isnt much help either.

She went alone, taking two flights from her home in Chicago and rounding up her wardrobe before meeting with two filmmakers, Zia Anger and Ashley Connor. They were three young women equipped with only a Bolex camera, a single light source, two rolls of film and a detailed plan for how to create the effect Olsen wanted: a black-and-white clip that would have her disappearing and reappearing, double-exposed in patches of light. They spent tedious hours drawing lines on the floor to mark out positions, arranging and rearranging the camera and light, and filming, six times, Olsen mouthing the words of Tiniest Seed, a haunting waltz on which her voice trembles and flickers like a candle in a dark room. After each shot, they rewound the Bolex and did it again, unable to review the footage on site, hoping the different pieces would fit together, joking about getting rabies from the bats above them.",2019-09-04T09:00:02+0000

Barnum in The Greatest Showman, Hugh Jackman starred in this drama, which effectively posits that the former Senator Gary Harts 1987 presidential campaign was brought down by a media circus. Directed by Jason Reitman, the movie casts Jackman as Hart. It focuses on a period of weeks that begin with Hart being widely considered the most likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, and ends with the politician suspending his campaign after it is overcome by rumors of extramarital activities. The film belongs to the accusatory tradition of Ace in the Hole, Network and Absence of Malice, movies that see reporters and editors not as guardians of democracy but as barbarians inside the gates of the republic, subverting its values through cynicism, self-importance and mercenary scandal-mongering, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. Reitman uses Altmanesque sound design and serpentine camera movements to convey the chaos and kineticism of a process in constant, frantic motion, he added. But after a while, once weve met the principal players, the speechmaking starts and a potential comedy of political manners turns into a pious, tendentious morality play.",2019-09-05T05:00:08+0000

They had known each other since the mid-aughts, sharing both a social circle that revolved around Marlow and many wine-world connections: At the time, the two men (with their respective jobs) were among the only buyers in Brooklyn of the kind of biodynamic, organic, natural wine that has since changed contemporary drinking patterns and palates in nearly every city around the world  and which now fills the shelves of Stranger Wines, their Havemeyer Street storefront that opens this week. Here, inside a 1,000-square-foot space that was, in fact, previously a wine shop (they even kept the same shelves, lightening up the room by adding several Noguchi lanterns and buckets of white paint), McNany and Tarlow are selling bottles from people who actually grow the grapes and farm the fruit, says Tarlow, whose restaurant portfolio (Diner, Romans, Achilles Heel) has long heralded a similarly intimate, person-to-person ethos.

A year after Saoirse Ronan played a pink-haired, rebellious teenager in the indie drama Lady Bird, she returned to the big screen as the title character of this period drama, Mary Stuart. Adapted from a biography by John Guy, the film reimagines the decades-long tug of war between Mary and another queen, her Protestant cousin Elizabeth I (Margot Robbie). When a young Mary returns to Scotland from France in 1561 and claims the throne, she asserts she also has the right to Elizabeths crown. That sets off a deadly rivalry between the monarchs, which is heightened by dubious men who manipulate their rulers only to inch closer to royalty. The movie opened to mixed reviews; some critics argued the performances were uneven and that Ronan dominates the picture. And while historians may find faults in the plot, the visuals place you right in 16th-century Britain. (The film received Oscar nominations for costume design and makeup and hairstyling.) THE FAVOURITE (2018), another historical drama about women scheming for royalty, leads in at 5:55 p.m.",2019-09-07T05:00:19+0000

(Spoiler alert!) While the killer of the title is no longer in the picture, his influence lingers on. Mike Hale, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that the show may lack Kings intensity, but it holds on to a measure of the authors dark humor.",2019-09-10T05:00:07+0000

The series, directed by the Israeli filmmaker Gideon Raff, follows Eli Cohen (who is not related to the actor who portrays him) in the early 1960s as he poses as a Syrian shipping magnate. I saw Eli Cohen, as he was written in the show, as an extreme version of myself, Baron Cohen said in a recent interview with The New York Times.

Toggling between work and family life can be a challenge no matter your profession, but its especially trying for Ray Shoesmith, the contract killer at the center of this series. Outside of work, Ray is also raising a young daughter and trying to foster a new, post-divorce relationship. Played by the Australian actor and writer Scott Ryan, Ray spent the first season both nurturing life and taking it away, easing his daughter into the news that Santa isnt real in one scene and having a shootout in another. In his review of that season for The New York Times, Mike Hale referred to the show as another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability  in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and Everybody Loves Raymond. The story, Hale added, deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Rays violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor. Ray will continue straddling that gap in the second season, which debuts Thursday.",2019-09-12T05:00:05+0000

He based the faces on models from Sears catalogs and stock photos, but calls the type a Redbook Juggler, after the supermarket glossy that advises women on how to cook, shop and dress. While Currins exaggerated compositions blow his figures up to kewpie-doll proportions or deflate them into a jumble of jutting elbows and toothy smiles, he renders each inch of flesh in laborious, glowing brushwork that has earned him comparisons to Dutch masters. He was, in fact, exhibited alongside the celebrated Golden Age Dutch painter Cornelis van Haarlem, at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands in 2011, just two decades after his first solo show at the Andrea Rosen Gallery in 1992 (where his provocative portraits of bold older women elicited accusations of sexism but nevertheless sold out). Currins works still draw that criticism on occasion, but not much that he depicts emerges solely from his own imagination. His subjects wash in from the flotsam of American life  kitschy souvenirs and cringey ads, screenshots and centerfolds  and its by polishing this lowbrow commerical imagery with a high-art sheen that he manages to make obvious what others might be happy to ignore about our culture.

At the turn of the last century, the Swedish doctor Axel Munthe constructed the villa upon the ruins of a palace from the time of the Roman emperor Tiberius, and the artifacts abandoned there in the first century A.D. became the enduring antiquarian ornaments of the doctors residence, where Latin stone plaques, marble corkscrew columns, and statues, missing their noses or other extremities, alternate with Roman copies and medieval relics throughout the property. In 1929, Munthe wrote The Story of San Michele, a best-selling memoir translated into more than 40 languages that included run-ins with ghosts and guiding voices as he pursued his dream of the villa.

us,What Can Brain Scans Tell Us About Sex?,"Men have a far greater appetite for sex and are more attracted to pornography than women are. This is the timeworn stereotype that science has long reinforced. Alfred Kinsey, Americas first prominent sexologist, published in the late 1940s and early 1950s his survey results confirming that men are aroused more easily and often by sexual imagery than women. It made sense, evolutionary psychologists theorized, that womens erotic pleasure might be tempered by the potential burdens of pregnancy, birth and child rearing  that they would require a deeper emotional connection with a partner to feel turned on than men, whose primal urge is simply procreation. Modern statistics showing that men are still the dominant consumers of online porn seem to support this thinking, as does the fact that men are more prone to hypersexuality, whereas a lack of desire and anorgasmia are more prevalent in women. So it was somewhat surprising when a paper in the prestigious journal P.N.A.S. reported in July that what happens in the brains of female study subjects when they look at sexual imagery is pretty much the same as what happens in the brains of their male counterparts.",2019-09-18T09:00:02+0000

The airplane was the latest version of the Boeing 737, a gleaming new 737 Max that was delivered merely three months before. The captain was a 31-year-old Indian named Bhavye Suneja, who did his initial flight training at a small and now-defunct school in San Carlos, Calif., and opted for an entry-level job with Lion Air in 2011. Lion Air is an aggressive airline that dominates the rapidly expanding Indonesian market in low-cost air travel and is one of Boeings largest customers worldwide. It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots  most of them recent graduates of its own academy  and for paying them little and working them hard. Pilots like Suneja who come from the outside typically sign on in the hope of building hours and moving on to a better job. Lion Air gave him some simulator time and a uniform, put him into the co-pilots seat of a 737 and then made him a captain sooner than a more conventional airline would have. Nonetheless, by last Oct. 29, Suneja had accumulated 6,028 hours and 45 minutes of flight time, so he was no longer a neophyte. On the coming run, it would be his turn to do the flying.",2019-09-18T09:00:03+0000

This sci-fi drama from the directors Pella Kagerman and Hugo Lilja is based on a downbeat 1956 poem by the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson. Like its source material, the movie tells a story that is, despite being about humans traveling beyond the confines of earths atmosphere, supremely claustrophobic: It centers on a spaceship knocked off course, out of fuel and running out of hope. The crew of the ship, which had left an earth in environmental ruin and was bound for a human colony on Mars, includes MR (Emelie Jonsson), the storys protagonist, whose situation becomes increasingly grim. At times, the commitment to bleakness feels artistically admirable, Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film unblinkingly faces the void, and it refuses to console the audience, which has come along for the ride. But mostly, this is a movie that simulates the experience of losing the will to live, a daunting premise even for the bravest voyagers.",2019-09-19T05:00:05+0000

us,"T Suggests: Photographs of 70s California, a Family-Made Olive Oil, and More","Out this month  to accompany a show at the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco  is a beautiful monograph of the work of the photographer Michael Jang. Born in 1951, Jang is Chinese-American, and grew up in Marysville, Calif., which is right outside Sacramento. From the start, he showed a natural affinity with the camera  his earliest pictures are of the Jang family in intimate moments: gathering at Christmas, watering the garden, doing the laundry. The pictures are playful, full of curiosity and laughter. Later, while attending school at Cal Arts, Jang found ways to rub shoulders with movie stars and politicians and other celebrities at the Beverly Hilton Hotel  he photographed figures such as Ronald Reagan, Jack Lemmon and David Bowie. Other moments, with crowds or bellhops, show how people and faces were fascinating for Jang. Afterward, he moved north to San Francisco, where he began to capture scenes on the street or out at night. It was the 70s, and theres something electric about seeing San Francisco through Jangs eyes. I grew up in the Bay Area a decade and a half later, not too far from where Jang wandered around (and still does)  and though his pictures feel very familiar to me, thats not why I find them so compelling. Theres something to admire in how technically precise Jang is in working in black and white  he seems to understand intuitively the depth of a picture before he even takes it, and I admire him more for how incredibly witty he can be, catching visual puns or simply revealing the humor of a particular moment: the college kid who has passed out sucking his thumb; the expression on the Sex Pistols Johnny Rottens face caught by surprise while lying low at Japantowns Miyako Hotel. Michael Jangs California is on view from Sept. 27, 2019 to Jan. 18, 2020 at McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.

Nxivm presented itself as a personal fulfillment program, but some of its female members say they were recruited into a secret society within the group, known as D.O.S., where they were branded, threatened with blackmail and assigned to have sex with Raniere. Its no wonder, then, that the operations of the enclave, which prosecutors likened to that of a horror movie, serve as the inspiration for this made-for-TV film. Based on the tell-all memoir Captive, by the actress Catherine Oxenberg, the film follows Oxenbergs struggle to free her daughter, India, from the groups secret society. Peter Facinelli plays the enigmatic Nxvim leader, and Sara Fletcher plays Allison Mack, the Smallville actress who pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy related to her involvement in the group.",2019-09-21T05:00:06+0000

The show, which ended after eight seasons this spring, has already won 10 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and could very well win best drama for the fourth time.

Among the newcomers are fan favorites like Schitts Creek, which is up for best comedy, and Fleabag, which was nominated for 11 awards, including best acting and best writing for its creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The event itself will go hostless this year, but Jenny McCarthy, Shannon Sharpe and Kelly Osbourne will co-host Foxs red carpet coverage starting at 6:30 p.m. Over on E!, Giuliana Rancic and Jason Kennedy will do the honors, beginning at 6 p.m. ",2019-09-22T05:00:06+0000

The query does a tidy job of summing up what this show does: mix procedural and supernatural thrills.

In Dr. Bouchard, that pair finds a person whose expertise can help distinguish demonic possession from run-of-the-mill insanity.

Anti-government militants have killed and threatened civilians as well. People cant get to the hospital, they cant communicate with loved ones, they cant go to school or work.

The territory will soon be cut in half and each piece will become a federal enclave.The Indian government, which is controlled by a popular Hindu nationalist political party, says these moves are necessary to bring peace to Kashmir. For decades, the region has been racked by unrest, rebellion, warfare and bloodshed. Pakistan, Indias rival, also claims parts of Kashmir and is accused of stirring up an anti-India insurgency.Indian officials knew that stripping Kashmirs statehood would be deeply unpopular.
