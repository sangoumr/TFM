For Tarfon, the work was the study of Torah  that is, the unfinishable task of trying to understand Gods word. But with the gradual and tenuous emancipations of European Jewry throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Tarfons injunction to study became assimilated too, as Jews were admitted to secular schools and exchanged the traditional texts for the sciences. In effect, the task stayed the same, while the work itself changed, from the study of Gods word to the study of (for example) medicine and law. For German Jews in particular, the work came to stand for the free transmission of knowledge, the assertion of moral absolutes and ethical standards, and the preservation of the Enlightenment-era democratic rationality that had finally liberated them from the ghettos in the revolutions of 1848, and that would keep them out of the ghettos for just under a century.",2022-10-03T09:00:19+0000

Theres also a savory pie of the day, a throwback to Mr. Szymanskis well-received stint at Cherry Point in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, introduced here with a filling of chicken, pigs trotter and leeks. The menu features offal, with black pudding alongside clams, a pigs head terrine with piccalilli, and braised tripe with cipollini onions and Madeira. Mr. Szymanski and Ms. Howard do not deny the influence of the chef Fergus Henderson, the British master of nose-to-tail. The brick-walled, 60-seat dining room is fitted with a stretch of marble bar, walnut furnishings, booths and hunter green drapery accents, including around a semi-secluded enclave.

us,This Kids Show Proves the Wisdom of Gibberish,"In the unreal early days of the pandemic, when it seemed foolish to try to comprehend the enormity of what we were collectively living through, a clay penguin reacquainted me with the clarifying power of gibberish. Pingu is a stop-motion childrens television show about the titular character, a penguin tyke who lives with his family in a little igloo village at the South Pole. Initially, the episodes appear to be light five-minute affairs about the small dramas of toddler penguinhood: Pingu spits his veggies into the toilet; a municipal penguin employee turns Pingus play area into a parking spot. But with a balance of farce and sentiment, the show also gestures toward some of early lifes more complicated realities  sibling rivalries, parental punishment and the loneliness of childhood. Created by the German animator Otmar Gutmann, Pingu premiered in Europe in the early 1990s and became a worldwide phenomenon; but unlike other global cultural crazes, the show did not need to be dubbed or subtitled. Nothing could be lost in translation because there was nothing to translate. Every Pingu character speaks the language of Penguinese, which sounds like Thai, Indonesian, Italian, something in between or something else entirely. Yet, despite the lingos seeming inscrutability, it is mysteriously  hilariously  comprehensible.",2022-10-11T09:00:09+0000

For all its past profitability, now the trees have gory black cavities up and down their trunks where, too many times, the bark was hacked and rehacked to extract the resin and the pines, over too many years, were tricked and tricked again into healing themselves.

Most economists expected the process of wrestling down rising prices and cooling off the economy to be slow  though it is starting to seem that even small signs of progress are not cropping up where they should. And now some worry that as inflation becomes more entrenched it could lead to a wage-price spiral, a no-win feedback loop in which rising prices lead to wage increases that then reinforce inflation.",2022-10-16T11:00:07+0000

Nearly every line is interrupted with a caesura (a period, em dash, comma or question mark), mirroring a zigzagging mind. The poem rhetorically and emotionally zigzags, too, between statements and questions. The title is repeated in the first line with an anaphora of The son Ill never have, adding immediate gravity to the poem. The imagined child is crossing the lawn, and the reader is brought imagistically into a momentary sense of loss. But the speaker doesnt dare describe the boys knees  theres only so far the speaker is willing to go emotionally. This poem, though, complicates itself further when the speaker laments the childs sloppy eating and the challenges of parenting. The second occasion of anaphora occurs with the set of questions beginning, What is it to ... , and the resolved response of Ill never know. The poems ending is more surreal as the imaginary boys pet rabbit reappears. The last line elevates the poem with its haunting strangeness  the rabbit isnt real with its cloudy fur and can be stroked only in the imagination.

But I love the reading I do for my work. People think that film is in some ways the enemy of the word. And its not, in our case. We dont believe in that dialectic whatsoever. In the beginning is the word. And our films reflect that. They are written. Theyve been enormous collaborations that Ive had with Geoffrey C. Ward and Dayton Duncan over the years, and with my oldest daughter, Sarah Burns, and her husband, David McMahon, who have written the scripts for the films. Theyre long ongoing processes. Unlike many cinematic circumstances, the first drafts for these do not come down from Mount Sinai written in stone. They are something that you never stop working on. And our most recent film, The U.S. and the Holocaust, written by Geoffrey C. Ward, is a case in point where even after wed locked the film  which is the semi-technical term in filmmaking for promising your sound editors you wont touch it anymore  we unlocked it a million times to remove an adjective or to add a qualifying perhaps or some believe, or whatever it might be, just to be more faithful to the intensely rigorous scholarship we try to attend to with every film.",2022-10-20T09:00:10+0000

Kuangs Babel is a 500-plus-page feast of ideas and speculative adventure, while Jonathan Coes Mr. Wilder and Me imagines the slow fade of a famous film directors career and Andrew Sean Greer sends his comic protagonist Arthur Less on a picaresque tour of America. If its an amuse bouche youre looking for, George Saunders is one of the most reliably amusing storytellers there is; his new collection, Liberation Day, takes a darker turn than some of his work has, but it remains characteristically funny and pensive and knowing. Also on the short story front, new collections from the masterly David Means and the celebrated comics writer Alan Moore, along with a novel in stories by Omolola Ijeoma Ogunyemi. In nonfiction, we recommend Maggie Habermans New York-centric biography of Donald Trump and Amy Liptrots The Instant, a meditative memoir (or memoiristic meditation?) about Berlin and the digital age.

The Hotel I Booked Online Became a Homeless Shelter and No One Told Me.,"Last month, I was to attend a friends Saturday wedding in Manhattan and then catch up with my husband at his family reunion on Sunday in Atlanta. So I booked a room at the Queens County Inn and Suites in Long Island City via Booking.com, not far from LaGuardia, where I would catch a 6 a.m. flight Sunday morning. But when I arrived at the hotel around 11:30 p.m., I found it had been converted into a homeless shelter. Alone and nearly five months pregnant, I felt very unsafe in the neighborhood and finally got an Uber so that I could wait at the airport as I contacted Booking.com. The representative did not seem to appreciate the gravity of the situation, and told me she needed to email the hotel and give them 30 minutes to respond before she could help. Over an hour later, the representative, who told me no supervisors were available, said I would receive an email with new lodging arrangements. I never did (and the hotels I tried were all booked because of the U.S. Open tennis tournament). Meanwhile, LaGuardia was closed, so I waited outside  in a wheelchair a kind maintenance worker provided  until the doors opened at 4 a.m. The hotel didnt charge me, so money is not an issue.

Now, with several partners, hes poised to showcase the cuisine of Peru, most notably the region where hes from, with its abundant seafood and a cuisine that represents Spanish, African, Indigenous and Chinese influences. Some Andean and Amazonian ingredients, like sachatomate and culantro, make their way into his food, and potatoes, native to Peru, figure in often-complex preparations like a thousand-layer gratin, a foam to sauce 24-hour short ribs, and a layered causa with steak tartare. There are ceviches, like one with octopus, fried calamari and chulpi (corn nuts). Octopus is served with beans and aji amarillo; and fish comes with plantains, yucca and Amazonia curry. The Chinese influence comes in with pork belly, char siu and snow peas. Theres a seven-course tasting menu ($140) in addition to an  la carte menu. All of this is presented in a setting that combines a bar area and dining room seating 46 with an open kitchen. Theres a private dining room on the lower level. Stone presentation plates are hand-carved, and Peruvian artifacts are on display in a room filled with greenery. The drinks are a showcase for pisco.
