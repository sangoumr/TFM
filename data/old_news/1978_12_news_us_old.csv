us,Film: A Late de Sica:From Pirandello Novel,"IN common with many other great men, Vittorio de Sica, the Italian film maker who died four years ago. had a chronic weakness that was as disorienting to him as a whiff of booze can be to the alcoholic. Mr. De Sica, the social critic (""The Bicycle Thief"") with an immense talent for comedy as both an actor (""It Started in Naples"") and as a director (""Marriage Italian-Style""), was from time to time subject to fits of teary sentimentality that upset his balance and completely dissolved his judgment.As a sentimentalist Mr. De Sica never went on a bender by himself. He surrounded himself with friends, as if the making of these ponderously romantic movies were really occasions of great conviviality. Perhaps they were, though it never shows in the completed pictures.Think of the laughably long-faced ""A Place for Lovers,"" in which the magnificently structured Faye Dunaway succumbed to Marcello Mastroianni and death (in that order) in some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, from a disease never identified except for the lack of horrid symptoms.In ""Sunflower"" he persuaded Mr. Mastroianni and the exuberant Sophia Loren to play out a woeful tale about a plucky little peasant woman who hitchhikes her way to the Soviet Union after World War II to search for her reportedly lost-in-action soldier-husband. Does she find him? Does Naples have a bay?That ""The Voyage,"" which Mr. De Sica made the year before he died, is only now reaching us is not difficult to understand. The film, which opens today at the Thalia Theater, has the manner of something out of sync with itself and the world around it.I'm not referring to the sound of the English-dubbed dialogue, which isn't great (though the film's three stars, Miss Loren, Richard Burton and Ian Bannen, are speaking their own lines), but to other aspects of the film that are even more important.""The Voyage,"" based on a Luigi Pirandello novel I do not know, is set in Sicily in the years just before World War I and is another unnamed-fatal-disease picture.It's the unusually unconvincing story of Cesare Braggi (Mr. Burton), the scion of rich landed gentry, his younger brother Antonio (Mr. Bannen), and the beautiful young seamstress Adriana (Miss Loren) whom Cesare loves but whose hand he presents to Antonio in accordance with the wishes expressed in their father's will.Nothing in the movie fits. The casting of two extremely English actors as Sicilian aristocrats need not have been ludicrous  one of the best performances Burt Lancaster ever gave was in Luchino Visconti's ""The Leopard.""But even if Mr. Burton and Mr. Bannen had been Italian they would have been wrong for the movie. They are too old and their temperaments do not suit the cinematic landscape. Miss Loren's age is not right but, worse, she has no role.The movie, now at least four years old, may have been edited somewhere along the line  I do not know  but the evidence on view at the Thalia suggests there never was a role for this most intelligent, inventive, seductive, profoundly surprising of actresses.""The Voyage"" consists of a lot of pretty sets and costumes, much period detail (an early automobile with unreliable brakes is a key plot device), some comically irrelevant references to world events (like that nasty shooting in Sarajevo), while the two lovers refuse to acknowledge their passion until a major obstacle to that passion falls off the side of a mountain.Movies like ""The Voyage"" couldn't be made without falls off mountains, nor without the sort of heart trouble Adriana suffers without too much inconvenience until it's time for the film to end. Then it's gulp, over and out.The English-language screenplay, which, I assume, is faithful to the Italian one written by Diego Fabbri, Massimo Franciosa and Luisa Montagnana, is chock full of the kind of lines you haven'y heard since Andrew and Virgina Stone penned their screen version of ""Song of Norway.""Some are funny (""Who was that, dear?"" ""That was the maestro Puccini"") but most are simply out of touch with the feelings and emotions the movie should be dealing in.",1978-12-01T05:00:00+0000

The distinction seems to me not only neat but valid. Sometimes the minor poet declares himself as such by writing little or by confining himself to one kind of poem or a restricted range or experience.

The differences between the wares in the two sales begins with European taste versus American taste. A Continental clientele inspired the 203 lots at Christie's, pieces that were consigned by the Danziger Brothers, two Englishmen who owned Cartier's in France in the 1960's and sold it in 1972 to Robert Hocq, the present owner, a French industrialist. The Sotheby's sale is of jewelry made for the Kenton Corporation, a conglomerate that owned Cartier in New York from 1968 to 1976, when Mr. Hocq bought the New York branch, reuniting it with all the branches of Cartier under his full command. When he took over, the stock made to the orders of the previous owners, orders in this country and abroad were edited from inventories of the different stores. The range of selections is considerable at Christie's and includes stocking stuffers that are cuter than they are choice  jewelstudded birds, donkeys, dogs and cats that carry presale estimates of $80 to $1,000.

us,Screen: Brink's Job As Comic Caper:Dream Caper,"EVERYBODY has his fantasy  the untended candy store, the pay-telephone that offers free calls to Paris, the breakaway bikini and, of course, easy access to the vault of your favorite bank. The seven men who successfully robbed the Brink's armored car company in Boston of more than $2.7 million in January 1950 realized their dream. And, to judge from the continued interest in the caper, they realized the dreams of a lot of other peopleFor one brief instant, the Brink's bandits  small-time hoods who lucked into what was called ""the crime of the century""  wallowed in money, green-backs, the kind we carry in our wallets, nothing as esoteric as stocks or bonds or letters of credit. They were up to their ears in the real thing. After that, it was one long hangover. For most of them it wasn't much fun, but it was worth that moment of glorious, physical possession.This is the approach of William Friedkin's ""The Brink's Job,"" which attempts to take a lighthearted view of the robbery, but is only involving when it plays these events more or less straight, something that the 1955 Tony Curtis film, ""Six Bridges to Cross,"" failed to do.""The Brink's Job,"" opening today at the Criterion and Gemini I Theaters, covers a lot more years than any caper movie has any right to do  from the late 1930's to the late 50's  in order to explain the backgrounds of the hoods involved. However, because the characters are so one-dimensional, it seems a waste of the movie's time and ours.It's the kind of movie in which each actor registers just about all he has to work with in any one scene. Essentially they are cartoon types. There is the leader of the gang, a sentimental petty thief named Tony Pino (Peter Falk), who loves his wife, Mary (Gena Rowlands), and pursues his dream to success only because he's too stupid to know better.The other gang members are played by Allen Goorwitz (whom we used to know as Allen Garfield), as Tony's almost fatally clumsy brother-in-law; Peter Boyle, as a short-tempered, mean-spirited Irishman; Paul Sorvino, as a bookie and the one member of the crew who seems capable of spelling his own name correctly; Warren Oates, as a battle-fatigued explosives expert who is not so expert when the chips are down, and Kevin O'Connor and Gerard Murphy as the soldiers of the company.The film, which was written by Walon Green, adapted from a novel by Noel Behn, is neither especially comic nor  and this is surprising, considering Mr. Friedkin's success with ""The French Connection""  suspenseful. As in his last film, ""Sorcerer,"" Mr. Friedkin seems bent on supplying us with more sociological information than is entirely necessary, whereas more information about the heist itself would have been welcome. For example, were the Brink's people really as casual about security as they are shown to be in this film?The movie looks very handsome and rather bigger and more expensive than the story actually warrants, except, of course, for the cash we see on screen. The performances are intelligent without being particularly believable or fun. One continually has the impression that Mr. Falk, Mr. Goorwitz and Miss Rowlands are playing down to roles that aren't good enough for them. Mr. Boyle's role is one that he could telephone in by this time. Mr. Sorvino plays it as it comes, which is without fuss but without tremendous conviction. Only Mr. Oates has anything to do as the probably psychologically disturbed war veteran, and he's not around very long.""The Brink's Job"" doesn't do justice to our fantasy, which is, I suppose, only a misdemeanor.""The Brink's Job,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some vulgar language but little real violence.",1978-12-08T05:00:00+0000

She was mother of Vita SackvilleWest, novelist poet, friend of Virginia Woolf and wife of Harold Nicolson (cf. Portrait of a Marriage). Vita actually wrote her story together with the story of her grandmother Pepita's in a wonderful book called Pepita. Mrs. Alsop has added to this cache of information Lady Sackville's very frank diary, her letters and The Book of Happy Reminiscences for My Old Age given to her by Vita's son, Nigel Nicolson. The result is a biography filled with more exclamation marks than any romantic novel. Yet Mrs. Alsop isn't altogether to blame. Lady Sackville's own favorite saying was Quel Roman est ma vie!

Webster announced last week that he had decided not to discipline most of the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents involved in illegal breakins, mail openings and wiretaps in the New York area in the early 1970's, he added that if he had been weighing the matter as a judge, rather than as the bureau's director, he probably would have done the same thing. Citing what he called the climate of the times, the former Federal judge from St. Louis asserted that to punish agents who had acted in good faith would be both counterproductive and unfair.",1978-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Bloom and Friends,"HUGH KENNER'S original and entertaining study of, chiefly, Ulysses fulfills in an exemplary manner the Quantum desideratum: a richness of detail and insight within about one hundred pages of print. Short enough to be read in an evening and significant enough to be a book. It is a reworking of lectures given at the University of Kent in Canterbury to honor the name of the other Saint Thomas. As I myself am due to deliver the Eliot lectures there in 1980, despair at being able to emulate Professor Kenner's erudite elegance clouds my admiration. Professor Kenner's own admiration for Eliot had, inauspiciously for the occasion, to be clouded by his need to reject a famous pronouncement by Eliot about the mythological method in Ulysses. The mythic element in that book, Professor Kenner says, rightly I believe, is not important. Imaginative writers deal in the particularities of putting sentences together, not with deliberately evoking vague and ancient and irrelevant entities. Ulysses is called what it is, but what if, like one of Stephen Dedalus's greenly green unwritten epiphanies, it had been called P?

Her simple, eloquent truth cut through to the core of every issue and fortified our resolve and determination. Her life of ceaseless sacrifice taught us the meaning of true giving. A founder of the restored Jewish mitten, a kindier of the renewed light of Jewish life, a fighter for peace with justice for the people of Israel and for the mothers and children of all the nations of the Middle East, she was larger than life and her legacy to all Jews everywhere is larger than the death that has overtaken her.

us,"Movie: 'Dossier 51,' Study in Infiltration:Invasion of Privacy","MICHEL DEVILLE's new French film, ""Dossier 51,"" is the sort of movie that's more interesting to talk about than to sit through. Its method is more intellectual than emotional or dramatic, which is not to say that it's as profound as it is arid. The movie, which was shown at this year's New York Film Festival, opens today at the 8th Street Playhouse and the newly partitioned Cinema Studio 1.""Dossier 51"" is an adaptation by Mr. Deville and Gilles Perrault of Mr. Perrault's novel about the activities of an unidentified intelligence agency as it seeks a possible candidate to infiltrate an international trade organization. The agency, which could be the Central Intelligence Agency or some, such group, picks on a young French diplomat and then, with the help of just about every surveillance device developed by man, studies its fellow to find ways in which he might possibly be blackmailed. He is followed, as is his wife, and his wife's lover; his apartment is bugged, as is his wife's lover's apartment; his activities are filmed whenever feasible; his friends, family and servants are questioned, and sometimes sexually seduced; his childhood is examined and analyzed for character defects until, at last, the agency gets the goods on the poor man.In an attempt to dramatize this terrifying invasion of privacy, Mr. Deville has sought out a cinematic equivalent to the method of Mr. Perrault's novel, which told the story through official reports and memorandums that kept the subject of the investigation at several removes from the reader. Mr. Deville does more or less the same thing, composing the movie entirely of secret films, tape recordings, written and oral reports of agents who write and talk in the jargon of their trade.The idea is more sound in theory than in practice, because it's virtually impossible to see any difference between what are supposed to be secret films and the visualized verbal reports that are presented to us. Mr. Deville's intention that this method will somehow implicate all of us in the audience as voyeurs overlooks the fact that all movies effectively implicate the members of the audience as voyeurs. It's one of the ways in which fiction works.""Dossier 51"" thus is more cinematically tricky than psychologically shocking. It's not only that we're all fairly well aware of the awful possibilities of electronic surveillance and the uses to which it may be put  Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" dramatized this nightmare far more eerily  but that Mr. Deville's agents (unseen except in mirrors or films-within-the-film) are so clever and resourceful that there's never any suspense in the movie. It's a butterfly hunt. We don't especially care about the victim, about the agents, or even about their methods, which, unfortunately, no longer have the power to astonish.There are further technical problems. Actors playing directly to the subjective camera tend to become extremely self-conscious. The method of the movie never allows us or them to forget the camera. There is a single dramatic scene in the entire film, when an undercover agent interview's 51's (code name for the victim) mother and she spills the beans about her son's true parentage and some sad details about her own life. Franoise Lugagne, who plays the mother, creates the one living character in the film, but Mr. Deville, apparently knowing that he had a good thing going here, allows the scene to go on so long that it finally undercuts not only Miss Lugagne, but everything else in the picture.The movie takes a small boy's delight in the jargon and syntax of the spy trade. People, things and operations are all called by their code names (Jupiter, Minerva, 51, 52, 52B, Zephyr, Dead Leaves, etc.) to such an extent that one wishes one had been equipped with a lexicon on entering the theater. Much of the film is in French with English subtitles, but the soundtrack narration and the conversation of the unseen agents are presented in an English that sounds as if it had been written and recorded by Martians.",1978-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 2 at the Thalia,"BETWEEN the time when Lamont Johnson directed the brilliantly economical ""The Last American Hero"" and then moved on to direct Margaux Hemingway and Farrah Fawcett-Majors in their screen debuts (""Lipstick"" and ""Somebody Killed Her Husband,"" respectively), he made an interesting departure: ""Visit to a Chief's Son,"" a 1974 adventure film set in Africa, among the Masai tribe. Previously unreleased, it opens today at the Thalia on a double bill with ""Homebodies,"" another unreleased film from 1974.""Visit to a Chief's Son"" is based on the experiences of Robert Halmi, who journeyed to Africa as a photographer for Life magazine, wrote a book about his trip, then went on to produce a film about it.Accordingly, one might suppose the character based on Mr. Halmi would be an attractive and sympathetic one. But no: The anthropologist named Robert who visits Kenya with his adolescent son has surprisingly little respect for or understanding of the natives, and when he and the boy retreat to their own camp they take American-style showers and drink Coca-Cola. Indeed, when the son makes friends with a Masai boy his own age, the first thing young Kevin teaches young Kodoyno is how to shake up a soda bottle and douse somebody with the spray.With the notable exception of Johnny Sekka, who plays the chief of the title with a welcome cynicism and a winning smile, the non-Masai actors barely hold the screen. But they are upstaged by some remarkable scene-stealers: baby hippos, baby elephants, exotic birds and a lake that seems covered with flamingos, from shore to shore. The rest of the film plays like a relatively transparent pretext for the wildlife footage, but the animal shots are spectacular, and there are a great many of them  more than enough to be worth the price of admission.The most appealing thing about ""Homebodies"" is its premise. A band of old people in Cincinnati decide they don't like young people, especially the young people who are trying to evict them from their condemned apartment building, which is being torn down to make room for more skyscrapers.So they begin defending themselves, disposing of an ill-tempered social worker and a greedy builder and anyone else who gets in their way. Eventually, they declare war on one another, and at this juncture the film loses its quotient of dotty charm. Without their sense of common purpose, they're not a particularly appealing bunch, and in any case Larry Yust, the director, isn't able to hold these two halves of the film together.""Homebodies"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains some fairly routine violence, plus a scene involving the amputation of a dead man's foot.",1978-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Movie","IN a season in which our motion-picture comic strips have been either heavily mythic (""The Lord of the Rings"") or simply pretentious (""Watership Down""), ""Superman"" is good, clean, simple-minded fun, though it's a movie whose limited appeal is built in. There isn't a thought in this film's head that would be out of place on the side of a box of Wheaties. But to describe as good, clean, simple-minded fun a film on which so much effort, time and talent have been expended is to sound a muted warning.To enjoy this movie as much as one has a right to expect, one has either to be a Superman nut, the sort of trivia expert who has absorbed all there is to know about the planet Krypton, or to check one's wits at the door, which may be more than a lot of people are prepared to do for longer than two hours.The Superman comic strip has been carefully, elaborately, sometimes wittily blown up for the big-theater screen, which, though busy, often seems sort of empty. In Christopher Reeve, a young New York stage and television actor who plays Superman and Clark Kent, the mild-mannered newspaper reporter who is Superman's cover, the producers and Richard Donner, the director, have a performer who manages to be both funny and comic-strip heroic without making a fool of himself. Mr. Reeve even looks like something drawn on an easel, being composed entirely of firm lines without a bit of shading. Margot Kidder is also most charming, revealing (is this for the first time?) that Lois Lane is the sort of newspaper reporter who puts two p's in rapist.The supporting cast is of a caliber one might otherwise expect to see only at fund-raising events for American Indians, the American Film Institute or the March of Dimes. Marlon Brando turns up early in the saga as Superman's dad, Jor-El, who looks rather like George Washington with chrome finish on his hair. Glenn Ford has two scenes as Superman's adopted earth-father.Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine play the members of the evil trio whose attempts to destroy California (by activating the San Andreas fault) form what might be called the plot. Jackie Cooper plays the harried editor of The Daily Planet, and a number of other major actors, including Terence Stamp, Susannah York, Harry Andrews, Trevor Howard and Maria Schell, play roles so small the actors should wear numbers for immediate identification.This kind of casting is prodigal but it is an essential element in a film in which extravagance is the dominant style.The screenplay appears to have been composed by a unisex basketball team  Mario Puzo, who is credited with the original story; David Newman, Leslie Newman (who is the wife of David) and Robert Benton, who in 1966 wrote a Broadway musical about Superman with Mr. Newman. Tom Mankiewicz receives credit as creative consultant, but, because he is a writer, I assume he might also have written a line or two.There have been a number of published statements by people connected with the film to the effect that the Superman legend has been treated without condescension, not as camp, which is more or less true, though the movie's brightest moments are those very broad ones supplied by Mr. Hackman, Mr. Beatty and Miss Perrine, whose bosom submits to her bodice only with a fight. Their comic moments recall the best of the old Batman television series.For all intents and purposes Mr. Brando plays it straight, applying to Krypton's most brilliant scientist a neo-English accent and a mock gravity that are funny because he's the actor he is.The movie does nothing lightly or quickly. After opening credits that are so portentous they could be announcing the discovery of a new mouthwash, the film spends what seems to be an interminable amount of time (approximately an hour) on Krypton explaining the planet's domestic problems (worse than but not as complicated as Iran's) and Superman's heritage, a sequence climaxed by the destruction of Krypton. The rest of the movie proceeds at the panel-by-panel pace of a comic strip, with Superman/Clark Kent's courting of Lois Lane and fighting for ""truth, justice and the American way.""The special effects are mostly very good, especially the montages in which we see Superman flying faster than a speeding bullet, saving trains, buses, airplanes (Air Force One) from untimely crashes, or just taking Lois Lane for an evening's spin over New York.""Superman,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, doesn't transcend its origins, as ""Star Wars"" did, but it never means to. For me it's as if somebody had constructed a building as tall as the World Trade Center in the color and shape of a carrot. Rabbits might admire it. They might even write learned critiques about it and find it both an inspiration and a reward, while the rest of us would see nothing but an alarmingly large, imitation carrot.""Superman,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains two (according to my count) harmless double-entendres.",1978-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Deer Hunter',"MICHAEL CIMINO'S ""The Deer Hunter"" is a big, awkward, crazily ambitious, sometimes breathtaking motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie about this country since ""The Godfather."" Though he has written a number of screenplays, Mr. Cimino has only directed one other movie (the 1974 box-office hit, ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot""), which makes his present achievement even more impressive. Maybe he just didn't know enough to stop. Instead, he's tried to create a film that is nothing less than an appraisal of American life in the second half of the 20th century.I don't mean to make ""The Deer Hunter"" sound like ""War and Peace"" or even ""Gone With the Wind."" Its view is limited and its narrative at times sketchy. It's about three young men who have been raised together in a Pennsylvania steel town, work together in its mill, drink, bowl and raise hell together, and then, for no better reason than that the war is there, they go off to fight in Vietnam.""The Deer Hunter,"" which opens today at the Coronet, is an update on the national dream, long after World War II when America's self-confidence peaked, after the Marshall Plan, after Korea, dealing with people who've grown up in the television age and matured in the decade of assassinations and disbelief.The three friends, all of Russian extraction, are Mike (Robert DeNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steve (John Savage). Mike is the one who calls the tune for his friends. To the extent that any one of them has an interior life, it is Mike, a man who makes a big thing about hunting, about bringing down a deer with one shot. More than one shot apparently isn't fair. As codes go this one is not great, but it is his own.Nick goes along with Mike, sometimes suspecting that Mike is eccentric, but respecting his eccentricities. Steve is the conventional one, whose marriage (a Russian Orthodox ceremony, followed by a huge, hysterical reception) occupies most of the film's first hour and sets out in rich detail what I take to be one of the movie's principal concerns  what happens to Americans when their rituals have become only quaint reminders of the past rather than life-ordering rules of the present.Mr. Cimino has described his treatment of the three friends' war experiences as surreal, which is another way of saying that a lot of recent history is elipsized or shaped to fit the needs of the film. What is not surreal is the brutality of the war and its brutalizing effects, scenes that haunt ""The Deer Hunter"" and give point to the film even as it slips into the wildest sort of melodrama, which Mr. Cimino plays out against the background of the collapse of Saigon and the American withdrawal from Southeast Asia. It's Armageddon with helicopters.Most particular and most savage is the film's use of Russian roulette as a metaphor for war's waste. It's introduced when the three friends, prisoners of war of the North Vietnamese, are forced by their captors to play Russian roulette with one another. The game crops up again in Saigon where, according to this film, it was played in back-street arenas rather like cock-fighting pits, for high-dollar stakes. These sequences are as explicitly bloody as anything you're likely to see in a commercial film. They are so rough, in fact, that they raise the question of whether such vivid portrayals don't become dehumanizing themselves.More terrifying than the violence  certainly more provocative and moving  is the way each of the soldiers reacts to his war experiences. Not once does anyone question the war or his participation in it. This passivity may be the real horror at the center of American life, and more significant than any number of hope-filled tales about raised political consciousnesses. What are these veterans left with? Feelings of contained befuddlement, a desire to make do and, perhaps, a more profound appreciation for love, friendship and community. The big answers elude them, as do the big questions.Deric Washburn's screenplay, which takes its time in the way of a big novel, provides fine roles for Mr. DeNiro, Mr. Walken and Mr. Savage, each of whom does some of his best work to date. Meryl Streep, who has long been recognized for her fine performances on the New York stage, gives a smashing film performance as the young woman, who, by tacit agreement among the friends, becomes Nick's girl but who stays around long enough to assert herself. In the splendid supporting cast are George Dzundza, Chuck Aspegren, Shirley Stoler and Rutanya Alda. The late John Cazale makes his last film appearance a memorable one as the kind of barroom neurotic who might at any moment go seriously off his rocker.The film has been stunningly photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond, who provides visually a continuity that is sometimes lacking in the rest of the movie. ""The Deer Hunter"" is both deeply troubling and troublesome (for the manner in which Mr. Cimino manipulates the narrative), but its feelings for time, place and blue-collar people are genuine, and its vision is that of an original, major new film maker.",1978-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Horse's World,"""JUST CRAZY ABOUT HORSES"" is, as its title implies, less about horses than obsessive horse worship. The documentary, which opens today at the Guild Theater, is a jaundiced valentine from a young film maker to the horse set in which he was raised. It is an absorbing  and horrific  excursion into a world that is unfamiliar to most, whether devoted Central Park canterer or racetrack habitue. Money, breeding and a certain casual arrogance are required. The horses endure.Tim Lovejoy, who wrote and produced ""Just Crazy"" with Joe Wemple, has created an episodic collage of events and personalities in this, his first film. Buyers at a thoroughbred auction are urged to ponder the ""residual values"" in one mare's ovaries and, later, jockeys ride out onto the course to well-bred, almost languid rooting from the stands. The camera sidles into the middle of a crowd of steeplechase groupies, fur coats slung carelessly into car trunks and faces avid with gossip. We stroll into a pre-hunt party at one lavish ""place""  for houses are ""places"" here and dogs are ""hounds"" who ""speak"" rather than bark  that was bought, as its owner laughingly recalls, as a ""hedge against F.D.R.""There are wonderful comic moments. An inarticulate jockey slips into equine body language. A very graphic breeding scene opens with a shot of a stallion teaser, a horse of dubious lineage who is fated only to test a mare's readiness for breeding, and closes with the mated mare being lead away covered delicately in a white sheet. A butler wanders onto a rolling green field to serve a bloody mary to his master and an exquisitely bored dressage rider reveals that ""racing in Bombay especially was very popular."" A Hepburn sound-alike drawls that she's rooting for a rider because ""she's a nice person without masses of money.""We watch an operation performed on a knock-kneed colt, then the camera cuts to a woman confined to a wheelchair after a riding accident, a horse breeder who strapped her crippled body to her horse for one last ride. We meet an equestrian who lives by candlelight in an attempt to re-create the 18th century in his splendid mansion. And the wounded rejects of the horse set are also introduced and their fantasy worlds explored with gentle good taste.It all becomes a little numbing but there are sudden compensations: A stallion canters free across a green meadow, a foal totters to its feet a few moments after birth and a tiny would-be rider urges a woolly sheep to a trot. In the film's most affecting scene, a stableman and mare exchange a look of haunting pain as her first foal is delivered stillborn.Peter Stein's grainy photography at first seems only to attest to the film's low-budget status but its softened edges and blurred colors become seductive, a good match for Sam Waymon's easy-going score and Tammy Grimes's amusingly smudge-voiced delivery of the rather breathless script.""Just Crazy About Horses"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because of scenes of mare breeding and foals being born. Squeamish adults also take note.",1978-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: After 'Love Story',"WHO can forget about a 25-year-old girl who died? Not Oliver Barrett 4th, that's for sure. At the beginning of ""Oliver's Story,"" which opens today at Loews State, the Trans-Lux East and Walter Reade 34th Street East, Oliver is sitting in a graveyard mourning his lost Jenny; at the end of the film, he's sitting by the banks of the Charles River doing much the same thing.The ads for ""Oliver's Story"" feature a prettily windswept photo of Ryan O'Neal (as Oliver) and Candice Bergen (as Marcie, the new woman in his life), plus the slogan ""It takes someone very special to help you forget someone very special."" But if you imagine that that indicates the film is about Oliver's falling for Marcie and starting life anew, well, you probably think love means never having to say you're sorry.In fact, the message of ""Oliver's Story"" is a decidedly gloomy one: You get just one shot at young love, and after that you're over the hill. The happy-go-lucky Oliver of ""Love Story"" is gone, replaced by a prematurely middle-aged fellow who grinds away at his job, worries about his family responsibilities and spends some excruciatingly dull sessions with his psychotherapist. (""Nothing happens magically, Oliver,"" the doctor says on a particularly dreary day. ""But just being aware of a problem is beginning to solve it."")When Oliver and Marcie take a whirlwind tour of Hong Kong, they're actually there on a business trip and hardly even enjoying themselves. Over dinner they talk about where they first learned to use chopsticks and how many rolls of film Oliver has used up while touring the city.At least ""Love Story"" had a romantic and moderately rebellious world-view, being opposed to parental authority and in favor of angels in the snow. ""Oliver's Story"" is stodgy through and through, with a hero and heroine who have one good time together jogging through Central Park and never again match the thrill of that moment. Perhaps their detachment and their weary soul-searching and their willingness to get up at 6 A.M. for a good game of tennis are signs of the times. That doesn't make their saga the stuff of which dreams are made.The screenplay manages to take every possible edge off Erich Segal's novel, even though finding the edges can't have been easy. As written by Mr. Segal and John Korty, who directed it, the script teams Oliver with a WASP department-store heiress whose take-charge attitude eventually gets on his nerves.In Mr. Segal's book, this was supposed to contrast sharply with the memory of Jenny, with her unaffected, lower-class ways, and to remind Oliver of his aristocratic parents, whom he never much liked. In the film, Miss Bergen is only a slight departure from Ali MacGraw, who never seemed all that economically deprived in the first place, so the point is lost. A scene of Mr. Segal's, in which Marcie met Oliver's parents and  unlike Jenny  was a big hit, has been dropped from the movie, as has every other useful parallel with ""Love Story.""In fact, all that remains of the first film are Francis Lai's theme song and a little photo of Miss MacGraw on Mr. O'Neal's nighttable, right next to the Excedrin. This is not to suggest that Mr. Korty has moved on in any imaginative way, or that he is above falling back on ""Love Story"" every time new inspiration eludes him. After Oliver has a fight with Marcie, for instance, Mr. Korty has him drive all the way to Cambridge, just so he can trot briefly and wordlessly past the other film's Harvard Yard settings.Jenny's father is still around (this time played by Edward Binns instead of John Marley), but he has conveniently forgotten all about his daughter and keeps urging Oliver to go out and have a good time. The Barrett parental estate serves a similarly perfunctory purpose. These evocations are so cold and clumsy that they effectively dispel all vestiges of the first film's highly marketable mood.Mr. Korty has the reputation of a fine independent film maker; his documentary about the DeBolt family, to be shown on television this weekend, won an Academy Award last year. But his direction of ""Oliver's Story"" is too unsure one moment, too insistent the next, and he has no eye for the glamour that might have been this film's last chance.Mr. O'Neal is certainly equal to the material, but Mr. Korty doesn't seem to trust him with it; too many montages seem devised to keep the actor from having to talk. Miss Bergen always looks spectacular in close-ups, so why, then, are there so many unflattering long shots of her in unbecoming costumes? And what use has been made of the (highly exploitable) memory of Jenny? The first sequence shows Mr. O'Neal watching her coffin being lowered into the ground, inch by tearjerking inch. But after that, for all his funk, he doesn't often think of her again. Perhaps it's just as well. This is the kind of sequel that could have her turning over in her grave.""Oliver's Story"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), because it contains one brief bedroom scene and because Marcie has inherited much of Jenny's smart-alecky vocabulary.",1978-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Uncle Joe does not sell his trumpet to pay for the operation. But that is the film's only surprise. ""Uncle Joe Shannon,"" which opens today at the Festival Theater, leaves no heart-string untugged.The film was conceived and written by Burt Young, its star, and it is an obvious labor of love. Nominated in 1976 for an Academy Award for his performance as Paulie the butcher in ""Rocky,"" Mr. Young has a deserved reputation as one of the best character actors in films today. He is also the author of a number of television screenplays. But someone else should have taken this one in hand. Mr. Young sinks even himself into a morass of sentimentality.""Uncle Joe"" tells the story of a star trumpet player who takes off on a long, fast slide into sell lestruction after his wife and young son die in a fire. In the process, he acquires a youthful side-kick who is also on the run from life, and together they whip each other back into shape as Christmas rolls inevitably around the corner.The film is full of odd improbabilities. Uncle Joe keeps his worn possessions, including his son's charred trumpet, in his unlocked room in a fleabag hotel. His trumpet remains at his side, intact, through binges and suicide attempts. A hospital and orphanage are broken into with surprising ease. And, scorned by a group of jazz-club barflys when he is unable to get through a trumpet solo, Uncle Joe has them jiving in the aisles when he swings into a syncopated version of ""Jingle Bells.""Mr. Young's own performance stays on a single, beery note throughout, pain registering in his face and trumpet solos (dubbed by Maynard Ferguson) alone. But, in his directorial debut, Joseph C. Hanwright has gotten good performances from Madge Sinclair and Jason Bernard, as Joe's long-suffering friends; from Martin Beck as the wryly wasted hotel proprietor and, in particular, from a remarkable, pudgy little 12-year-old actor named Doug McKeon, who has a welcome, sardonic way with his lines. Bill Butler's cameras capture the slick night surfaces and ruined faces of the street people of Los Angeles so that, clichs in themselves, they have the impact of sudden revelation.For no reason apparent to this viewer, this film was rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").",1978-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Far from being uniquely ancient  another canard  China was latecomer among the Old World civilizations; to hold the lead in technical and economic innovation, as it did throughout the European period of late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, it had to change much and quickly. During these centuries, China, like the other agrarian civilizations, suffered invasion by nomad horsemen the Huns, Avars, Turks and Mongols were visitors to both East and West  and by the international mass religions: Manichaeism and Christianity as well as Islam and Buddhism. China had her political ups and downs: ages of unity and division, of freedom and of control by foreigners. Only twice have the Chinese themselves ruled international empires: under the Ch'in and Han dynasties (21 B.C.A.D. 219) and under the Sui and T'ang (A. D. 581906).

Her work keeps its interest, I think, because of its intelligence, a philosophically educated, uninfatuated English moral intelligence with nothing flashy about it. Yet her novels have a lot of flash  thanks to her quite remarkable powers of invention. Her stories, including this one, are marked by an uncommon variety and complication of incident; the reader is continually surprised and shocked by the abrupt appearances, disappearances and reappearances of characters, unexpected couplings and uncouplings, sudden shifts into bizarrerie, epiphanies of the spiritual and invasions of the demonic. (The demons are manmade: We are all potentially demons to each other, writes Charles Arrowby, the narrator of The Sea, the Sea, after 495 pages of haunting and being haunted.)",1978-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,To Stand on Its Own English Feet,"BY November 1823, seven months after he had begun his long poem Eugene Onegin, and eight years before he finished it, Alexander Pushkin termed it a special sort of novel: I'm now working not on a novel but on a novel in verse  one hell of a difference. Eugene Onegin separates the moralistic 18thcentury novel  an imitative expression of some generally accepted essence  from the critical realism of the 19th century. Tatyana and Onegin's affair fails, as does that of her sister Olga with Lensky, but the story of their loves is an innovative success, Pushkin's triumphant courtship of the Muse leading to a new statement about man's nature. Onegin grows beyond the epigrams of salons, Pushkin beyond the vocabulary of the 1789 Academy dictionary, which excluded all foreign words unnecessarily introduced into Russian. As Tomashevsky pointed out, Pushkin wrote a book that, unlike the neoclassical and sentimental romanticism of his time, introduced new forms, new style, fresh language, and directly reflected life itself.",1978-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: In the Pursuit Of a Wife's Happiness:Boyish Adventures,"I HAVE trouble looking at the light side of Bertrand Blier's ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,"" a comedy with a heroine who isn't altogether funny. Here is a woman who barely speaks, never thinks, spends most of her time scrubbing and knitting, is completely available (and indifferent) to any man who wants her, and will be happy only when she is at last made pregnant. She has so little will of her own that a 13-year-old boy can persuade her to have sex with him by pointing out that he'll ""have to wait five, six years for another chance like this."" Arguably, she is an object of mystery. But by the same argument, so is a seashell or a goldfish or an ashtray.Here, as with his earlier ""Going Places,"" Mr. Blier stops me dead. I never had a clear or reasonable response to that film; I tuned out during a sequence in which two young men petulantly shot a female hairdresser with whom they were both involved, wounding her in the leg, and the woman was such a compliant dimwit that she didn't mind. Compared to that, the scene that showed Jeanne Moreau committing suicide by shooting herself in the genitals was a positive picnic.Mr. Blier's penchant for depicting behavior like this is certainly daring, but whether it amounts to anything truly provocative is another matter. Genuinely challenging an audience is one thing, and simply upsetting it is something else. At least in my case, Mr. Blier at his most outrageous doesn't elicit much more than fleeting, if heartfelt, indignation.In fairness, in ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" he also elicits a great many laughs, and that's certainly more than could be said for ""Going Places."" This time, the same two actors (Grard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere) play the same kind of oversized, irrepressible children, floundering around a woman whose true nature eludes them. She (Carol Laure) is the wife of one of them (Mr. Depardieu) but she's been depressed and uncommunicative for a while. Marriage being whatever it is today, her husband decides she needs another man to cheer her up, and recruits Mr. Dewaere in a restaurant.Their ostensible pursuit of the wife's happiness launches the two men on a series of adventures that makes them seem ever more boyish, until they encounter an adolescent (Riton) who is infinitely wiser and manlier than they. Ever more overshadowed by him, they find their high spirits and their connection with the wife both waning.Until it takes this fairly solemn turn, the film is an exuberant and highly inventive comedy, filled with the very funny quirks of these characters' lives. The Dewaere character has a collection of every Pocket Book ever printed, and can recite any title if he's given the serial number. The wife quietly knits matching sweaters for half the men in the movie. When Mr. Depardieu first strikes a bargain with Mr. Dewaere, he promises that if Mr Dewaere accepts the wife as a gift he will become Mr. Depardieu's pal, ""and when a man is my pal he can ask for anything."" Without the wife, though, ""there wouldn't be much to ask me for.""Both of these actors are at once knowing and funny, and their camaraderie can be wonderful to watch; Mr. Depardieu in particular projects an innocence so strenuous it takes on a demonic edge. Miss Laure does an amusing enough deadpan, but she's so opaque her charm eventually wears thin.Riton, the child actor, does a fine job, but there's something disconcerting about his prematurely mournful expression. Mr. Blier's device of setting his boyish adults in opposition to an adult boy has a certain cleverness. But his casting such a dolorous child merely calls too much attention to the patness of this part of the scenario, and to its pretension.Similarly, a late-night dormitory scene involving a number of small boys is shot with such overweening poignancy that it's out of sync with most of the film's airier mood. Mr. Blier has a habit of strong-arming his audience in one scene, and letting his characters drift aimiably in the next. That halting quality was effective enough in ""Going Places,"" but ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" is a much more substantial and sophisticated effort, in which even the slightest technical clumsiness is notably out of place.",1978-12-18T05:00:00+0000

And in his new book, On Human Nature, the third volume in a trilogy of which The Insect Societies (1971) and Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) formed the first two parts, Professor Wilson is assuming more or less the same thing that the ethological popularizers did. The question of interest, he writes, is no longer whether human social behavior is genetically determined; it is to what extent. The accumulated evidence for a large hereditary component is more detailed and compelling than most persons, including even geneticists, realize.

A few seconds later, hailstones the size of baseballs begin crashing onto the hot, arid, still sunlit landscape. The hail shatters windows, and a small boy, watching the display outside, is brutally slashed.Far away, the life of a great city is almost brought to a halt by rains that will not stop. Day and night the rains go on. In the middle of the night, David Burton (Richard Chamberlain), a Sydney lawyer, walks into his suburban garden to find that the ground is alive with movement. There are frogs everywhere  all sizes and shapes. Frogs in such number can threaten.One evening when Burton is driving home in the rain, the speaker of his car radio suddenly erupts with a cascade of water  sound magically given substance. It's as if primeval forces were reasserting their dominion over a world heretofore assumed to be civilized, comprehensible, under reason's control.Thus does Peter Weir, the young Australian director, vividly set the scene for ""The Last Wave,"" an Australian film about matters occult  mental telepathy, thought transference, the reality of dream life.The film, which opens today at the Beekman and Paramount Theaters, begins so brilliantly and with such promise that it's no real surprise that the closer it gets to its apocalypse, the less effective it becomes. The film's payoff is decidedly small, recalling nothing more esoteric than the discovery of the elephants' graveyard in one of the early Tarzan movies. Yet until we arrive at this breathless anticlimax, ""The Last Wave"" is a movingly moody shock-film, composed entirely of the kind of variations on mundane behavior and events that are most scary and disorienting because they so closely parallel the normal.The movie, written by Mr. Weir, Tony Morphett and Peter Popescu, is about the curious chain of events that starts when Burton, a liberal-thinking lawyer whose experience has been exclusively in corporation law, finds himself defending five aborigines accused of murdering a sixth in a Sydney alley. The circumstances are unusual. The slain man could have drowned (there's a small amount of water in his lungs and he was found near a mud puddle) or he could have had a heart attack. The coroner isn't sure.Making matters more difficult for the lawyer is the aborigines' complete indifference to their defense. Only one of them, Chris Lee (Gulpilil), a slight, dark fellow with an impassively cheerful moon-face, will talk to Burton, but this is more unnerving than enlightening since Lee, the lawyer realizes, has for some time been visiting him in his dreams.The plot that follows makes a great deal of the aborigines' tribal traditions and beliefs, particularly what they call ""dreamtime,"" a nonstop spirit-life that is for the believers more real than the ordinary world.Though the inspiration of Mr. Weir and his associates runs out before the end, ""The Last Wave"" is an impressive work from a director new to American audiences. He's a man whose ability to find the eerie in the commonplace might please Hitchcock. Mr. Weir got very nice performances from his cast, especially from Mr. Chamberlain, who knows that an actor's obligation in such a film is to play it as small and ordinary as possible, and from Gulpilil. This actor, a full-blooded aborigine, creates a fascinating, self-contained character, the sort of person who has been shown all the mysteries. As a result, he can no longer be surprised or hurt by anything, only mildly amused or disappointed.",1978-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Clint Eastwood Stars With an Orangutan:Monkey Business,"THE bright new star of ""Every Which Way but Loose"" is an orangutan named Clyde, and he has quite a repertory. He can kiss human actors, smile bashfully and make obscene hand gestures. He can fling up his arms and fall over in a faint, in a game of bang-bang-you're-dead. He can steal scenes even when they aren't worth stealing.Clyde's many talents notwithstanding, it's alarming to find Clint Eastwood co-starring with an ape. Mr. Eastwood's career since ""Dirty Harry"" has constituted one long argument for the studio system, for the days before established actors acquired so much control over their own movies that they could work on the flimsiest, most aimless projects with impurity. It's been a long time since Mr. Eastwood made a movie designed for a star.Some of his directorial efforts have been impressive, and his choice of Michael Cimino to direct ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" certainly indicates that his taste in protgs is shrewd. But his last couple of films have been so lackadaisically plotted, and so haphazardly put together, that they come close to resembling loose strings of blackout sketches with no particular end in sight.Mr. Eastwood doesn't have the kind of comic agility that would make these episodes individually bright, nor does he tie them together with consistent, tightly coiled characterizations anymore. Far from showing off Mr. Eastwood to flattering advantage, this kind of format virtually eclipses his talents.""Every Which Way but Loose,"" which opens today at Flagship theaters, is the slackest and most harebrained of Mr. Eastwood's recent movies. It is overlong and virtually uneventful, even though there are half a dozen cute characters and woolly subplots competing for the viewer's attentions. Ruth Gordon plays Mr. Eastwood's mother, and the cute thing about her is that she curses and owns a shotgun and can't pass her driving test. Sondra Locke plays a country singer with whom Mr. Eastwood is smitten, and it there's anything cute about her at all, it's the fact that she absolutely can't sing.As for the subplots, one has to do with a couple of cops who feel slighted by Mr. Eastwood in a barroom encounter and decide to chase him. Another involves a ne'er-do-well gang of motorcycle hoods who also tangle with Mr. Eastwood and follow him around. A third involves a love affair between Mr. Eastwood's brother and a woman he meets at a fruit stand. A fourth involves Mr. Eastwood's picking fights that his brother can bet on from time to time. No wonder Clyde is the man of the hour.If ""Every Which Way but Loose"" gets anywhere at all, it will be on the strength of Mr. Eastwood's considerable charisma, and on the fact that he and Miss Locke work well together even when there's nothing to work on. In ""The Enforcer,"" in which they also co-starred, Mr. Eastwood played a slow-witted cop whom Miss Locke was forever outsmarting, and the departure from his usual tough-guy cynicism was reasonably intriguing. Here, though, the only clearly defined role is Clyde's. The others merely muddle through.""Every Which Way but Loose,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a certain amount of rough language, mostly from Miss Gordon, and a little libidinous activity, mostly from Clyde.",1978-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Gypsy Kings And Their Subjects:A Matter of Succession,"THE gypsies should sue. True, it would be something of a con job, since ""King of the Gypsies"" isn't the worst film of the year. Yet I think the ancient, Romany-speaking tribes could whomp up a good case for their having been maligned by a movie that presents them as an endangered species without once making their plight emotionally arresting or anthropologically important. They've been ripped off. The gypsies themselves would call it a boojo.Taking as his source material Peter Maas's extensively researched book, which was based on interviews and personal observations and experiences, Frank Pierson has written and directed a melodrama about three generations of gypsies that is all color and no substance. Instead of defining the ways in which their heritage is unique, the movie wants us to believe that gypsies are like every other ethnic group that's been seen in popular movies.Perhaps they are a bit noisier and more peripatetic, but essentially they are just folks who have their antisocial whims and ways as they drink, dance, celebrate family reunions, love each other one minute and fight to the death the next.This may be Mr. Pierson's way of dramatizing their humanity, but the effect is mostly the opposite, to trivialize them. ""King of the Gypsies"" is ""The Godfather"" played in storefronts.The movie, which opens today at New York theaters, even sounds like ""The Godfather,"" as when one gypsy accuses another of not having respect. Like a ""Godfather"" clone, it's also about a war of succession, when the old king of the gypsies, played by Sterling Hayden, his fair skin lathered with make-up, skips the obvious heir to pass his scepter on to a younger, supposedly more capable man.At the center of the problem, though, is the movie's lack of a point of view toward its subject. Dave, the young gypsy who becomes king when the old king dies, is first introduced as a fellow who wants to escape the gypsy heritage. In his almost tongue-tied way he has asked his grandfather, ""Where are the gypsy surgeons? Where are the gypsy astronauts?"" From what we see, Dave has a point. We seem to be on the verge of something seminal  the first movie about gypsy liberation!Yet watching this movie, one never has a clear idea whether total integration is something to be wished, so that these mostly illiterate, swindling gypsies might vanish into a homogenized America, or an impulse to be resisted, so that an ancient culture might be preserved. When, at the end, the gypsy king finds himself ruling as before, he's not been trapped by his heritage, but by an act that seems completely uncharacteristic.From what Mr. Pierson shows us, gypsies and the world in general probably would be better off if integration were successful, but I can't believe we are meant to be quite so cool. Part of the confusion, I suspect, is because the film fails so utterly to make these people's problems at all moving or urgent. Because we don't feel for them, they become minor freaks of time.As much as the movie exploits gypsies, it also exploits the actors, all of whom have been seen to better advantage in other films. In addition to Mr. Hayden, who acts all over the place and never gets out of the paper bag that is the movie, the cast includes a subdued, very fat Shelley Winters as the old queen of the gypsies; Judd Hirsch as Mr. Hayden's psychotic son who covets the crown and would kill his son for it; Susan Sarandon as the daughter-in-law, a role that permits her the one breast-feeding scene that's become her quota in recent pictures; Brooke Shields as a sweet gypsy girl who looks as if she should wash her face and go back to school at Brearley, and Annette O'Toole as the red-haired WASP whom the young king loves and loses.Eric Roberts, a handsome young man new to films, plays the gypsy heir and may be a good actor, though here he behaves as if he had studied the cinema of Richard Gere (""Blood Brothers,"" ""Days of Heaven"") to perfect a kind-mannered inarticulateness.The movie has a couple of scenes of blood-letting, which are surprising, since I'd always thought gypsies preferred to get their revenge in ways that didn't leave fingerprints. Sven Nykvist, best known as Ingmar Bergman's cameraman, makes the movie look very pretty even when prettiness is beside the point. As might be expected, the gypsy music never stops, but with Stephane Grappelli on violin, who cares?",1978-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: California Lovers:Pretty Kid, Older Woman","""MOMENT BY MOMENT"" is this year's California ""problem"" picture, that is, a movie in which people suffer for reasons that never seem very urgent in settings that, though not particular to California, are emblematic of what we think of as the California culture  elaborate beach houses, imported automobiles (public transportation is nowhere in sight), on throughways that are the main arteries of late 20th-century rootlessness.The film, which opens today at the Coronet, stars the usually incomparable Lily Tomlin as Trisha, a soon-to-be-divorced woman of 38, and John Travolta as Strip (which is his name as well as what he does), the none-too-bright drifter in his early 20's that she falls in love with.At the start Trisha is skeptical, being unable to imagine what a pretty kid like him would see in a rich, available, attractive, humorous older woman like her. After Strip's kid-magnetism gets her into bed, Trisha begins to fall in love with him and to see in him what she calls ""great potential,"" though he can't form complete sentences with much ease. When he does form sentences, they are often funny, but they indicate no great potential for anything. ""All my friends are undependable,"" says a gloomy Strip, ""except Greg, and he's in jail.""Trisha tells Strip he can be anything he wants, and Strip thinks fleetingly that he might like to be a veterinarian or paint billboards. Trisha is depressed, not by Strip's limited ambitions, but by the sudden realization that she has never wanted to be anything. Later she puts into a bottle a message reading simply ""What a world,"" which makes one realize that things are tough all over California.It's very difficult to understand what Miss Tomlin and Jane Wagner, who wrote and directed the film, wanted to do in ""Moment by Moment."" As romantic drama it's pretty tepid. That the two stars look enough alike to be brother and sister is no help, and though Miss Wagner's camera comes in for some tactful close-ups of flesh in the love scenes, they are singularly unerotic. One has the impression that these two lovers would prefer to be doing something else.Then, too, it's impossible to tell what we're to make of Trisha. Mr. Travolta has an easier time of it. Strip is not a terrifically interesting character, but he's a recognizable one, and the actor clearly has a point of view about him. Strip, who dropped out of school when he was 14 and now has no time for education, may luck onto something into the future, but his chances will diminish with age. He has a certain integrity that, instead of giving him direction, actually prevents him from being the successful hustler he was meant to be.This is the character we see in the film, though Miss Wagner and Miss Tomlin apparently want us to believe he is some kind of misunderstood innocent. If we are to believe the character of Trisha, who is supposed to be intelligent, then we can't believe the character of Strip. If we see him for what he is, it's not possible to go along with Trisha, unless Miss Tomlin is sending her up, which I don't think is the case.Maybe ""Moment by Moment"" is meant to be a call for sexual liberation  in the way in which it reverses the usual roles of seducer and seduced. I'm not sure. The script doesn't seem to have been thought through to a finish, but there is a further problem with the picture.In her one-woman Broadway show, ""Appearing Nitely,"" Miss Tomlin, with the help of Miss Wagner, created a series of remarkable characters, memorable misfits, men and women who were out of step with themselves, with other people or with the times. They were sketches, line drawings, fragments so artfully conceived that entire lives came and went in a matter of a few minutes of stage time.It was a curious and fascinating performance since Miss Tomlin herself seemed scarcely to exist. She was a medium to be shaped into somebody else. She's a marvelous monologist and can be a riveting actress, as she showed in ""Nashville"" and ""The Late Show."" In ""Moment by Moment,"" in a full-length, comparatively uneccentric role, she is completely miscast. The no-nonsense native intelligence of the real-life performer obscures the character she is trying to play.Watching her in ""Moment by Moment"" is to see an actress in the process of preparing a role, while she's still working on its psychological foundation. It's not an uninteresting performance, but it's cold, without shape yet, and it characterizes the movie that contains it.",1978-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Simon's 'Suite' Comes Back Home:Things Go Wrong,"NEIL SIMON deals in the kind of lethal wisecracks  putdowns with dum-dum bullets for centers  that often have a way of destroying the wrong people. In the mouths of unknowing characters they are dangerous weapons, instruments for the sort of accidental suicides that demolish everything in the neighborhood. His wisecracks define a world of mighty desperation in which every confrontation, be it with a lover, a child, a husband, a friend or a taxi driver, becomes a last chance for survival.When he writes a work in which this desperation is built into the situations Mr. Simon can be both immensely funny and surprisingly moving. Such were ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and ""The Sunshine Boys"" and such is his new ""California Suite,"" which opens today at the National and Loews Tower East and is the most agreeably realized Simon film in years.The screenplay was adapted by Mr. Simon from his four short plays, all set in the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, which were done on Broadway under the collective title of ""California Suite"" with the same actors tripling in several roles. For the movie Mr. Simon has intercut the stories, now played by eight stars, so that the film simulates the drive and cohesion of a single, seamless comedy.Despite its title, ""California Suite"" is anything but a California movie. It's about as far as you can get from the Pacific Ocean if your heart is in New York. Though the locale is California, the sensibility is of New York  rude, fast-paced, uproariously blunt and so insistently contemporary it could have been written tomorrow and (who knows?) out of date the day after.Here is Mr. Simon in top form, under the direction of Herbert Ross, one of the few directors (in addition to Elaine May) who can cope with the particular demands of material that simultaneously means to be touching and so non-stop clever one sometimes wants to gag him. It all works in ""California Suite,"" not only because the material is superior Simon, but also because the writer and the director have assembled a dream cast.Chief among these are Maggie Smith, who has her best screen role since ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,"" and Michael Caine, who is seldom acknowledged as the fine actor he is, playing a celebrated English actress and her antique-dealer husband who come to Hollywood for the Oscar ceremony. After having wrestled so long with movie material that offered no real contest, Miss Smith now has a part that makes use of her unique gift for comedy that has its origins in things far from pleasant.In the film's early scenes she is pricelessly funny, getting ready for her big night in a magnificent display of hope, panic and despair, knowing that she doesn't have a snowball's chance of winning the Oscar, but listening eagerly to even the dimmest person who thinks she has. When, without melodramatic effort, the tale becomes an examination of a marriage that has slipped into compromised intimacy, she and Mr. Caine create characters of unexpected depth and compassion.Jane Fonda and Alan Alda must deliver quintessential Simon dialogue, the sort that can undercut a comic situation of less importance than the one Mr. Simon has provided here. They are a long-divorced couple  he a successful Hollywood writer, she a confirmed New York career woman  who meet in Beverly Hills to discuss the future of their daughter, who has run away from her mother. Miss Fonda is superlative as the glib, semi-intellectual New Yorker whose only way of dealing with desperation is through sarcasm. Mr. Alda, playing it more or less straight, nicely complements her as the sort of man who doesn't have to be told when he's making a fool of himself. With him, that has been a conscious decision.Walter Matthau and Elaine May play the principals in Mr. Simon's boisterous West Coast version of bedroom farce. He is an aging middle-class businessman, very much the conservative husband, whose one night alone in Los Angeles almost destroys his marriage after his brother presents him with the present of a prepaid hooker. Watching Mr. Matthau, as his wife awaits on the other side of the door, trying to pull pantyhose onto the rubbery form of a very drunk hooker, is one of the more cheerful moments of the entire movie season.Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby appear as a pair of Chicago doctors who, with their wives, are sharing a vacation of the sort Mr. Simon cherishes. Everything goes wrong, including friendships. This sequence is the film's most frantic and, perhaps because of that, it runs out of breath before the end, but then no comedy can be completely perfect.""California Suite,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some mildly racy language and situations.",1978-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Movies: 'Force 10':Long Delayed Sequel,"""FORCE 10 From Navarone"" must be one of the longest-delayed sequels in film history, coming, as it does, 17 years after ""The Guns of Navarone."" The original was a World War II adventure yarn about British saboteurs assigned to destroy an ""impregnable"" German position.A fast-moving, simple-minded script by Carl Foreman, who also produced, and the performances of Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn, brought it considerable box-office success.Mr. Foreman has also written what is called in the credits the ""screen story"" for ""Force 10,"" with a screenplay by Robin Chapman.As was the original, it is based on a novel by Alistair Maclean, and continues the adventures of two members of the same suicide squad, here played by Robert Shaw, who died soon after the completion of the film, and Edward Fox, who played the title role in ""The Day of the Jackal.""From the Aegean they have moved to the Balkans, where they are seconded to an American Ranger unit, led by Harrison Ford, of ""Star Wars,"" that has been ordered either to destroy a bridge that the Wehrmacht can't do without or not to bother coming back.There the resemblance between the two films ends. The plot of ""Force 10"" is banally improbable. Guy Hamilton's direction is sluggish and the camera work, by Chris Challis, makes the least of the picturesque locations in the mountains of Montenegro.There is, moreover, an unmistakable air of haste and cost-cutting that suggests that most of the production budget went to pay the high-priced stars.Featured in the cast are Barbara Bach, a beauty miscast as a partisan fighter, Franco Nero, also miscast, as another of the locals, and Carl Weathers as the obligatory black member of the squad.""Force 10,"" in passing, considerably romanticizes the activities of the partisans, the irregular troops commanded by Marshal Tito, who has been the freely chosen president of Yugoslavia for 32 years now, and turns the Chetniks, who were linked to the Yugoslavian royalist government in exile in London, into eager Nazi collaborators.This film has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), possibly because of several violent episodes.",1978-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Movies: 2 Soviet Films Offer Treat for the Spirit:Symbolic Struggle,"BLACK shapes in an infinity of snow and wind, a knot of men and women stumble from hill to hill, children piled onto weary backs, pots and pans clanking in the vast silence. Two men leave to find food for their friends, on the run from ""the Jerries"" in wartime Russia. Captured by venal Nazi sympathizers, the two are pushed to psychological limits almost beyond endurance. One holds back his useless scraps of information, but the other betrays his friend and the hapless peasants they have unknowingly incriminated. It is a simple and familiar story that is told by ""The Ascent,"" a 1977 Russian film that opens today at the Thalia in a double bill with ""The White Ship,"" another prize-winning Russian film here receiving its New York premiere.But, though familiar, this is a fable re-created with an unabashed sense of grandeur as well as deeply touching humanity. Based on a story by Vasil Bykov and directed by Larisa Shepitko, ""The Ascent"" pits the idealism of the young schoolteacher, Sotnikov, against the driving will to live of his fellow soldier, Rybak. Rybak is a bear of a man who risks his life repeatedly to protect Sotnikov, but he cannot risk it for the good of so vague an entity as his country. It is he who escorts Sotnikov to the gallows. Sniveling, he lags behind his newfound traitor friends, botching a suicide attempt and terrified by the open gate that beckons so ironically at the end. And yet Rybak is never a villain. He is seen with surprising compassion throughout.Both men have the force and simplicity of symbols. We begin to know them in a deeper sense through their exchanges with the richly nuanced characters with whom they come in contact in an already vivid, shifting landscape scanned with a loving eye for detail. Vladimir Chukhnov's camera moves across stark snow, a remembered summer idyll, a peasant's cluttered shack, a harshly functional police torture roomone can almost smell the disinfectantand a village square peopled by peasants summoned to the hanging. The carnival atmosphere along the long climb to the gallows, where a band is playing, tells of the ordinariness of evil. Heroes do not die in heroic landscapes.The performances all have a searing luminosity, particularly those of Boris Plotnikov, as Sotnikov, and Vladimir Gostiukhin, as Rybak.It is the actors, too, who make ""The White Ship"" more than a lyrical little folktale. Nurgazi Sudygaliev, the child who plays a dreaming, naughty 7-year-old in this 1977 film, directed by Bolotbek Shamshiev and based on Chinghiz Aitmatov's rendering of Kirghiz legend, must have given the performance of a young lifetime here. He moves with mesmerizing lucidity and lack of artifice through this tale of a boy and his grandfather who nourish themselves on the myths of their people while their family claws its way to self-destruction.Photographed by Manasbek Musayev, ""The White Ship"" provides a tantalizing look at the rolling mountains and lush pastures of Soviet-Chinese border country, with occasional glimpses of a sterile modernistic city and mysterious rural shrines to the gods of the past. Like ""The Ascent,"" it is a treat for the eyes and the spirit.",1978-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Body Snatchers' Return in All Their Creepy Glory,"THERE's a little something extra in virtually every frame of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" Philip Kaufman's dazzling remake of one of the cleverest of horror classics (and has there ever been a better title for a movie of this sort?). In a shot of someone's office, the camera catches all of one window but just a tiny, ominous corner of another. Two characters go for a friendly drive in a car with a broken windshield. There are too many reflections, outstanding odd details, rays of curiously colored light. The leaves are covered with gelatinous ooze. Whatever the trouble is, it's everywhere.The trouble, as any horror buff or late-show aficionado well knows, is pod people. They have arrived ""from deep space,"" according to the ads for the new film (whatever that means, it has a lovely sound). At first they're only spores, but they mean to hatch everywhere  and every time a pod person appears, a human person vanishes. The pod people look just like their human counterparts, but they seldom blink and never smile. Their mission on Earth is never explained, but obviously they're up to no good. In Don Siegel's 1956 version, the story was swift and scary, set forth with a nightmarish economy. But Mr. Kaufman's film, which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is after something different. Mr. Kaufman's direction is so showy, constantly heralding its own ingenuity, that the film operates as both a valentine and a rich, good-hearted joke. Mr. Kaufman entices his audience with a running what-will-he-think-up-next? technique, and each time you begin thinking he's tried every trick in the book, he writes another new chapter.In its keen, loving attention to beautiful minutiae, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" recalls Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now""; in its intimations of cool, constant peril, it suggests Alan Pakula's ""The Parallax View."" (And, like ""The Parallax View,"" Mr. Kaufman's film climaxes on a split-level set, to emphasize a running element of duplicity.) But Mr. Kaufman adds to this an element of comic exaggeration: The creepiness he generates is so crazily ubiquitous it becomes funny.Accordingly, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" isn't as frightening as it might be (even though special effects involving the pods and their hairy tendrils are brilliantly unsettling, as is the gruesome moment when one character tries to murder his own half-formed clone). And in the latter half of the film, when the story slows down considerably, Mr. Kaufman's inventiveness begins to seem a bit untethered. The screenplay, by W. D. Richter, remains bright and lively throughout, but the plot just isn't full enough to carry a feature film.The characters are vivid, and uniformly well-played, and their pre-pod lives are fairly well established. But an hour into the film, once the menace is identified, the few remaining humans begin fleeing for their lives, and after that it's just run, run, run. It hardly helps that they are essentially heading for a dead end, or that in this age of ubiquitous news reports there's not a glimmer of information about what's going on outside San Francisco, no hint as to whether they can possibly be saved. Nor is it useful when Danny Zeitlin's excellent score evolves into an electronic version of ""Amazing Grace"" very late in the film. This may amount to an epiphany of sorts, but it's no substitute for a dramatically effective ending.There's a new character in this version, a hip, successful psychiatrist who explains away the legitimate fears of others with a surfeit of self-help jargon. But Leonard Nimoy isn't right for the role; he isn't funny enough. And, besides, in a movie like this it's much too easy to figure out which side he's on.The problem with Mr. Nimoy's character goes deeper than casting, though. Because Mr. Kaufman generally shoots his extras matter-of-factly, with no clear indication of who's been taken over and who hasn't, the feelings of contemporary urban mistrust that the film plays upon need a focus. And Mr. Nimoy's character, like the doctors in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" is meant to embody the essential unreliability of which one sometimes suspects one's fellows. If there were just one character in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" who successfully conveyed that kind of menace, the entire film would take place in a more intimate arena, and cut closer to the bone.Playing a foursome of embattled good guys, Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum and Veronica Cartwright are individually impressive and a very smooth ensemble, too. Miss Adams displays animation and intelligence that were far less apparent in ""Days of Heaven."" Mr. Sutherland is by turns personable and opaque, affecting in a way that he hasn't been since ""Klute."" Miss Cartwright stays on one's mind even during long intervals when she isn't on the screen. And Mr. Goldblum, who's had similar small roles in a number of movies, at last comes into his own. When it comes to playing nervous hot-heads with maniacal wit, he can't be beat.""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains brief nudity and one quick but frightening bloody episode.",1978-12-22T05:00:00+0000

He yells a lot but is immediately forgettable.Mr. Hough does nothing to improve a bad script. Among his problems is not knowing how to end a scene. Mostly someone just walks out of the frame and he cuts to the person remaining for a reaction shot when no reaction is due.Sometimes he tries to incite our interest by jumping into the dialogue from the scene to follow. Sometimes he blows a whistle or rings a bell.

And he can pass; he leads the Blue Devils in assists. But what Jim Spanarkel does best is understand the game, the nuances that coaches appreciate. Defense and team offenses that's basketball, he says. I think the thing I enjoy most is getting a good steal that leads to a quick basket. With so much emphasis on slam dunks and 25foot jump shots, basketball players like Jim Spanarkel are almost an endangered species, like the osprey. But for ospreywatchers, Jim Spanarkel can be observed in the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden later this week. Duke, the nation's topranked team, opposes Ohio State on Friday night, with the winner qualifying for Saturday night's title game against the RutgersSt. John's survivor.

us,Film: More Wilderness Family Fun:Suburb in the Wild,"BY the time the Wilderness Family gets around to ""The Further Adventures of the Wilderness Family, Part II,"" most of the excitement is behind them. In Part I, this wholesome foursome evidently decided to give up city life, retreated to a spectacular site in the Pacific Northwest, built a log cabin, learned to read by candlelight, and found themselves a couple of pet bears.As Part II begins, life in the middle of nowhere is very, very calm. Dad splits logs, Mom cooks dinner, and the children  depending on the season  either pick wildflowers or horse around in the snow. Though there's nary a station wagon in sight, the quality of this privileged life is eerily suburban.One hour and a lot of animal shots later, someone on the production end of ""Part II,"" which opened yesterday at the Embassy and other theaters, has decided that songs about snowflakes and footage of the Robinson family on snowshoes don't amount to much of a plot.So Mom wigs out, complaining that she can't stand bears in the house, and promptly catches pneumonia. The children weather a blizzard. Dad gets stuck in an avalanche. The cabin catches fire while the meanest wolf in the neighborhood  Old Scarface, he's called  is right outside the door. All of this happens in a hurry, and afterward everything is calm once more.As Dad, Robert F. Logan is a great success, full of reassuring smiles by day and dressed in long underwear by night  so he can leap out of bed in a hurry whenever there's trouble in the smokehouse or the chicken coop.Mr. Logan is a personable fellow who doesn't mind being upstaged by the odd cougar or raccoon. And he has played this same kind of Dad in a string of family wildlife adventure films, among them the recent and much better ""The Sea Gypsies,"" directed by Stewart Raffill, who also directed the first Wilderness Family film.But this time, his talent for patiently explaining the wonders of nature, and for providing useful object lessons for children, isn't put to much use. The small details of the Robinsons' daily life would doubtless be of interest to a young audience, but they're never really explained. The big action sequences have a trumped-up feeling, and they're over almost as soon as they begin.The other members of the cast don't make a very convincing family. There are a mother (Susan Damante Shaw), who doesn't really look as if she'd spend one night in a house without carpet; a young son (Ham Larsen), who's too noisily adorable, and an older daughter (Heather Rattray), who's too restrained.From time to time, the family is visited by a grizzled trader named Boomer, whose favorite words are ""heap"" and ""varmint"" and ""tarnation.""

This year the theater has presented the local theatrical premieres of two of the most interesting films to be seen here in 1978, Kenji Mizoguchi's ""A Geisha"" (1953) and Andrzej Wajda's ""Landscape After the Battle"" (1970), both films that could have not survived the economic rigors of conventional New York City first runs.""We Are Arab Jews in Israel,"" which opens at the Film Forum today, is not in the same category with those fiction films but it is a provocative, remarkably even-tempered movie, a two-hour documentary about a subject not often explored by the press because of the pressure to cover day-to-day events.The film is the work of Igaal Niddam, a Moroccan Jew and Israeli citizen, at present a resident of Switzerland, who strongly believes that Israel's population of Arab Jews could provide ""a natural bridge"" leading to an Israeli-Arab understanding.Though 65 percent of Israel's citizens are so-called Arab Jews, that is, Jews with origins in Arab countries, Mr. Niddam believes they are still a silent majority, inarticulate citizens who, often because of their low economic status, are ignored by the power structure. As a result, says this film, the political policies of the nation are largely determined by Jews whose attachments are to Western Europe and America, people whose cultural sympathies make it impossible for them to understand their Arab neighbors, or to be understood by them.""We Are Arab Jews in Israel"" seems to have been completed last year, before Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat began their negotiations for an Israeli-Egyptian settlement, though there's nothing in the film to make it seem dated. If anything, it offers clues to the present situation.It is obviously Mr. Niddam's belief that until Israel's Arab Jews find their voice, the present stalemate will continue. This point is eloquently made toward the end of the movie by a young man working on a kibbutz, an Iraqi Jew who also suggests that Zionism, in addition to defining Jewish nationalism, encouraged the previously undeveloped feelings of Arab nationalism. In effect, he says, one is responsible for the other.Mr. Niddam's method is straightforward and direct, without cinematic artifice. ""We Are Arab Jews in Israel"" deals with highly emotional, extremely complicated issues, but it never attempts to mask the emotion or the complexity, or the film maker's own point of view. The movie will play at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 P.M. and next week, Thursday though Sunday, at the same hour.",1978-12-28T05:00:00+0000

So, having experienced the triumphant joy of a beautiful baby at just the right time in life (whatever year that may be), I would like to discuss your choice with you, since you opened the matter to the public.",1978-12-31T05:00:00+0000

Vanderbilt, the widow of Cornelius grandson George, was ordered evicted from Mailands, a more modest Newport mansion where she refused to pay the rent hikes demanded by her landlord, Harold B. Casey  who, coincidentally, is the High Sheriff of Newport County. The sheriff asked for a fiveyear lease that would have raised Mrs. Vanderbilt's rent from $950 a month to $4,013 in the fifth year. Rather than pay, Mrs. Vanderbilt said I am a tenant who has been gouged just like lots of others, and led a protest march demanding the imposition of rent controls. She has joined the Newport County Tenant's Association, a group representing Newport's dwindling number of poor people, who don't care for their rents either.

A recent Governmentsponsored study at the SRI International Center for Research on Stress and Health found that workers who moved from shift to shift suffered severe disruption of their physical and psychological wellbeing. They had more accidents than other workers, consumed more alcohol and sleeping pills, and reported more digestive difficulties, menstrual disorders, colds, nervousness and fatigue. They also complained of less satisfactory domestic and social lives. The probable reason, according to Donald Tasto, a clinical psychologist who directed the study, is that changes in work schedules upset the body's natural biological rhythms. After a 180degree inversion of schedules, Dr. Tasto said, it takes three to four weeks for the circadian rhythms to become synchronized again, so it you change shifts every month your rhythms may be interrupted just as you're getting adiusted again.",1978-12-31T05:00:00+0000
