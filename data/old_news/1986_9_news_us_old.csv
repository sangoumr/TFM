Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times April 6, 1985. The film opens today at the Public, 425 Lafayette Avenue, and will be shown over four weekends. EDGAR REITZ'S ''HEIMAT'' is a cinematic event, if not quite a masterpiece. It's a massive, nearly 16-hour chronicle of life in Germany, from 1919 to 1982, as reflected in the fluctuating fortunes of the members of one family, initially peasant-farmers, in the fictitious village of Schabbach in the Rhineland. As literature, ''Heimat'' bears the same relationship to Rainer Werner Fassbinder's magnificent, equally long adaptation of Alfred Doblin's ''Berlin Alexanderplatz'' that Herman Wouk's ''Winds of War'' bears to Thomas Mann's ''Buddenbrooks.''",1986-09-05T05:00:00+0000

Miss Jordan gives the impression that she is feeling her way into a tune as if it were brand new, exploring it with a sense of wonder and a probing curiosity, even if she's been singing it for years. And the urbane, slightly detached ironies that many jazz vocalists bring to their interpretations have no place in Miss Jordan's musical world. Her interpretations of a song are always deeply felt; she communicates emotion directly, with a commitment that genuinely merits the overused adjective ''soulful.''",1986-09-05T05:00:00+0000

The bodies of two of the gunmen were found in the carnage. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] Calls for increased vigilance against terrorism came from governments and religious groups around the world in response to the terrorist attack on the synagogue in Istanbul. The United States and Israeli Governments, in separate statements, labeled the attack ''cowardly.''

Contradicting an earlier report that two of the gunmen in Friday's hijacking had died, law-enforcement officials also said that one of the four was seriously wounded. They said that of the four, one was from Syria, one from Bahrain and one was a Palestinian. But other sources said that four gunmen were from Beirut and had entered Pakistan last month on false Bahrain passports. [ 1:2. ] Six Karachi airport security officers were suspended for negligence in allowing the hijackers of a Pan American World Airways 747 to drive on the tarmac in a van disguised to look like an official security vehicle, official sources at the airport said.

In fact, such a strict accounting might slightly favor the original troupe, some of whose performances (David Threlfall as the battered orphan Smike, Edward Petherbridge as the tipsy clerk Newman Noggs) will haunt the public memory forever. But the alchemy of theater is not a matter of mathematics. Sometimes the alteration of a few elements in a large stage production, or a change in cultural climate inside or out of the playhouse, can have a disproportionately catalytic effect.

The record is one of strife, bloodshed, political intrigue, conflict, subterfuge, dynastic rivalries and arranged marriages, religious discord, persecution, economic turmoil and revolutionary upheaval. Domination of Flanders was the goal of the Romans, Franks, Vikings, French, Spaniards, Austrians, Germans, Dutch and even, in the Middle Ages, the English, who wanted free access for their wool in the great Flemish commercial and manufacturing centers, ports, waterways and rivers.

us,Q&A,"Q.Why are people over age 65 not allowed to donate blood? A.The American Red Cross normally accepts blood donations from people between the ages of 17 and 65, a spokesman said. Older people are more likely to suffer from physical ailments such as low blood pressure that would preclude them from giving blood, the spokesman said. However, the Red Cross will permit a person over age 65 to donate blood if he or she presents a letter from a physician indicating good health. The age limits were established to protect the donors as well as the recipients of the blood, she said. Q.Whatever happened to ''Russian sleep''? A.In the 1960's the Russians developed a technique for inducing sleep by placing electrodes over the eyelids. The device seemed to offer drug-free help for insomniacs, but there has never been a properly controlled study demonstrating that such devices work, according to Dr. Martin Reite, director of the Sleep Disorder Center at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ''I know of no type of low-power electromagnetic impulses that can produce sleep,'' Dr. Reite said. Dr. Reite is currently testing a sleep inducing machine made in Switzerland. The electrodes of this machine are attached to the mouth, and the electromagnetic energy is radiated to the head. Test results will not be available for several months. Some researchers have speculated that the externally applied energy might influence the normal rhythms of the brain, thus inducing sleep. Q.What causes wood to rot and what determines how fast the rot spreads? A. Wood decay is caused by fungi, nonvascular plants without roots that feed on organic matter, according to Dr. Terry L. Amburgey, a professor of wood science and technology at Mississippi State University. Dr. Amburgey said fungi contain threadlike strands, or hyphae, that excrete enzymes that break down organic material into sugars, which the fungi consume.",1986-09-09T05:00:00+0000

This time, the actor as author makes no pretension of delivering a full-dress autobiographical performance. This is a conversational run-through of many of the most important moments in his artistic life. It is as if a tennis champion had just stepped off court after a thunderous ovation and is telling his public how he won the final tie-breaker.

Wyman was forced out of his job Wednesday as chairman and chief executive after he lost favor with his two largest shareholders: William S. Paley, the founder of CBS, and Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation and a CBS board member. Mr. Wyman's resignation was followed yesterday by the departure of Van Gordon Sauter, president of CBS News. Q. Why did it happen now? A. Up until late last year, Mr. Wyman seemed securely at the top of CBS. His resignation came only after a series of setbacks and challenges, some personal, others corporate, had eroded his strength and isolated him from his board. Although Mr. Paley had handpicked him to run the company in 1980, Mr. Wyman, with the board's support, had squeezed Mr. Paley out of the chairman's seat and then generally ignored the advice the 84-year-old founder tried to offer from the sidelines, particularly about prime-time programming.",1986-09-12T05:00:00+0000

The rest is coming from a younger generation of artist photographers, whose interests range from mapping the interior truths of everyday existence to creating ironic icons of popular culture. While some of their pictures may appear comfortably familiar in style and content, others are montaged, collaged, painted over, incorporated into sculpture or otherwise taken out of the realm of realism.

The best of the food is zesty and the portions are large. Tagliarini puttanesca achieves just the right balance, its tomato sauce spiked with capers, olives and anchovies; tilefish or snapper pescador is served with clams, shrimp, mussels and scallops in a spicy tomato sauce; and a recommended special is snapper in Livornaise sauce, with white wine, tomatoes, garlic, capers and black olives. Other options include veal chops, skirt steak, lamb chops and shell steak. Entrees $14 to $22. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 P.M.: closed Sundays. LATTANZI, #361 West 46th Street (315-0980) - *(Sept. 14, 1984) A simply decorated dining room with exposed brick walls and small hanging lights provides the backdrop for some hearty Roman food. You might start with carciofi alla Giudea, which are baby artichokes in olive oil and garlic, or a pasta available in appetizer portions of tortellini filled with veal and sausages in a zesty tomato sauce. Main dish options include chicken nuggets in a creamy spiced tomato sauce; veal with mushrooms and sage; osso buco, and shrimp sauteed in wine and garlic.",1986-09-12T05:00:00+0000

He contradicts his own description of ''precision'' when he tells us of his difficulties with the lack of a French distinction between ''like'' and ''love.''

Any other suggestions for first-time cruise passengers? - G. J. D., Nutley, N.J. Answer:Travelers who have sailed on several trans-Panama Canal cruises say that more important than the direction is whether you want to fly out to the ship or fly home. All cruises through the canal are combined with - or require - a flight. For example, on a 15-day cruise in either direction between Fort Lauderdale and Los Angeles, the passenger flies to or from one of those two ports. People who live in Florida often prefer to sail from Los Angeles because then, when they disembark, perhaps carrying souvenirs, they can have someone meet them by car instead of having to get on a plane to go home. There is no significant difference, experienced cruisers say, in going through the locks one way or the other, and in either direction passage takes six to eight hours. But the Pacific side has strong tides, rising an average of about 12 1/2 feet; the Caribbean side's tidal range is less than a foot.",1986-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Enough beautiful faces were in attendance to fill several hefty September fashion magazines, beginning with the baseball-hatted Calvin Klein Girl, Jose Borain, who was checking names off a list at the door. Many of Mr. Weber's friends brought their friends in the hope that the photographer would discover them next. BLOOMINGDALE'S attracted more hordes Wednesday night at the opening of ''The World of Bloomingdale's'' promotion. Guests dined in the furniture department's model rooms, where one couple raised their glasses each time someone browsed by and, mimicking the store's slogan, announced, ''It's like no other world in the world.'' TINY violets used to be splashed on such things as hatboxes at Bonwit Teller in the 1930's and 1940's, according to Jay Hyde Crawford, an artist and fabric designer. In the 1960's, he grouped the violets into what he described as ''more with-it'' bouquets on Bonwit's shopping bags. Still in use after 25 years, his design for those bags is the point of a party honoring Mr. Crawford at the store tonight. In return, he recently gave a party in his East 50's town house.

Summit books. $18.95 If confirmation were needed of Edward Hoagland's distinction as a travel and nature writer, his new novel would provide it. ''Seven Rivers West'' is a virtuoso display of imagination grounded in affection and respect for the wild. The muscular prose penetrates the ways of the animals and plants, the rivers and mountains that confronted and confounded men moving west into the unknown toward the end of the 19th century. Unfortunately, the men are not as vividly realized as the forces of nature. They seem slight amid their awesome surroundings, and their desires seem transient and a little foolish compared to the basic responses they encounter. Perhaps that is what Mr. Hoagland wants to get across, but it works against his novel, his first in 20 years.",1986-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Miss Moore and Miss Redgrave will both play the title role, and if you think that's confusing, there will also be two actors, as yet uncast, playing the same male character.

Charles Mingus brought together the saxophonist George Adams, the pianist Don Pullen and the drummer Dannie Richmond in his mid-1970's quintet, and after Mingus died in 1979 they decided to stay together. With the bassist Cameron Brown, they have followed Mingus's mandate - to merge the freedom of modern jazz with the verities of the blues. Mr. Adams's tenor saxophone can be lightly melodic, acerbic or incantatory; Mr. Pullen can toss off florid harmonies, modal vamps and splashy, expressive sweeps and clusters, above the precisely articulated cross-rhythms of Mr. Richmond and Mr. Brown. Their repertory can be sampled on an engaging new album ''Breakthrough'' (Blue Note) - recorded after their last Vanguard engagement - but the quartet's delicacy and volcanic power are best heard live.

Daniloff to return to the United States, the White House said. There appeared to be no break in the case. Instead, the Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze surprised the American side by delivering a letter to Mr. Reagan containing the official response from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to Mr. Reagan's wide-ranging letter on arms control issues that was sent in late July. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] Ministers of major nations agreed on a global undertaking to ease national restrictions on international trade in such services as banking, insurance and shipping. Procedural discussions at the trade meeting in Uruguay continued into the evening on a final accord to set the agenda for the postwar era's eighth round of trade liberalization, but most delegates expressed optimism that a final agreement would be reached by the 74 participating nations.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THUNDER IN AMERICA. By Bob Faw and Nancy Skelton. (Texas Monthly, $16.95.) For a political reporter nowadays, there probably is no public figure more difficult to write about objectively than Jesse Jackson. Bob Faw, a CBS news correspondent, and Nancy Skelton, who covered Mr. Jackson's 1984 Presidential campaign for The Los Angeles Times, haven't done it perfectly. But their book sheds more light on Mr. Jackson and his remarkable adventure in American politics than several other recent works, which seemed aimed at proving the entire affair was all sound and fury, signifying nothing. In conventional political terms, Mr. Jackson's impact probably was minimal; at best, it was ambiguous. As one N.A.A.C.P. official observed, revulsion for Ronald Reagan probably did more to boost black voter registration than Jesse Jackson did. What's more, black gains were more than offset by increases in white registration, the result of a backlash inspired by fear and hatred of Mr. Jackson. But the Jackson campaign never was conventional, not in style or purpose or measures of success. And the differences are traceable ultimately to the peculiar character of the candidate. The strength of this book is that Mr. Faw and Ms. Skelton appreciated this central fact. They seek not to debunk but to come to terms with Jesse Jackson and so are able to penetrate his character in a way others have not. Race and racism - his own and others' - are only one part of the puzzle.",1986-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SONG OF THE SILENT SNOW. By Hubert Selby Jr. (Marion Boyars, $16.95.) Hubert Selby Jr. has created more Harrys than any writer since Shakespeare. They turn up in all of his novels: as the loudmouthed union thug fatally attracted to drag queens in ''Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' as the imagined sadistic rapist in ''The Room,'' as the sexually obsessive hero of ''The Demon'' and as an addict in search of the big payoff in ''Requiem for a Dream.'' It comes as no surprise that in this collection of stories we meet many more Harrys. Among them: a loser trying to impress a date; a salesman on a lucky streak; a Bowery bum; a middle-class suburbanite recovering from a nervous breakdown. Though they often resemble each other, they are seldom the same Harry. Mr. Selby has taken the theme of the double and given it a modern twist - a character who metastasizes new identities in story after story. Though the dark shadow of Edgar Allan Poe hangs over these split egos, the dominant emotion is not so much horror as panic. For Mr. Selby, panic seems to be the prevailing emotion of contemporary life, the nexus of blurred identity and sexual violence. ''Song of the Silent Snow'' fails to find the narrative grooves that made ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' so memorable. The tone of the collection is dated; a few of the stories were published before ''Last Exit'' and several others sound like early efforts. Mr. Selby himself seems conscious of a stilted style.",1986-09-21T05:00:00+0000

I learned that there are a growing number of young people who, while not brought up in a kosher tradition, are now keeping a kosher home.

The packet includes two brochures on radon and what to do about it, both published by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. It also includes a list of companies that do radon testing, although the department makes no recommendations about testers and has not begun certifying them yet. (2) - Call a testing service and request that your house be tested. The tests can cost from $12 to $400 and take from four days to three months or more. The service will either deliver the collection devices or send them to you. The devices are simple to use, but homeowners should follow directions about placement carefully. The devices must be returned to the service to be read. (3) - If the testing service reports that the radon in your house equals or exceeds the E.P.A. standard of four picocuries per liter, call the D.E.P. and request a confirmatory test. The first test is correct most of the time, but the D.E.P. will retest a house free of charge if the initial test showed a high level of radon. (4) - Once a radon problem has been confirmed, consult the E.P.A. brochures on how to reduce radon levels.

Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, that would reduce from $5,000 to $3,000 the maximum amount any such committee could donate to a candidate and increase from $1,000 to $1,500 the maximum contribution for an individual. The measure would limit House candidates to a total of $100,000 in PAC contributions for primary and general elections. Depending on the size of the state, a Senate candidate could receive from $175,000 to $750,000 in such donations. Prospects for the measure are uncertain in the House, but Mr. Boren plans to introduce it again next year in the Senate, where it was strongly opposed by Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Minnesota Republican, among others.

The club has hired a lawyer of its own to help defend the players, Ron Darling and Tim Teufel, who so far have been represented by Dick DeGuerin. Darling and Teufel were arrested last July 20 at a popular Houston nightspot, Cooter's Executive Games and Burgers, and accused of assaulting a pair of Cooter's finest, two uniformed Houston police officers working as bouncers at the disco. In disclosing that the club had hired a lawyer, the Mets' director of public relations, Jay Horwitz, stressed that there was no dissatisfaction with the players' lawyer. ''We have hired counsel just to be in the background, just to be of help if there is a need,'' he said. There was some indication, however, that the Mets might like to arrange a quick plea bargain. The first pre-trial hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 30, four days after the last possible World Series game, and Horowitz indicated the Mets would like to have the matter out of the way even before the playoffs, which begin Oct. 8. DeGuerin has ruled out a plea bargain, vowed a vigorous trial defense and publicly denounced the arresting officers and the police department program that allows them to hire out to private businesses.",1986-09-21T05:00:00+0000

WITH the third volume of his biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ''FDR: The New Deal Years 1933-1937,'' Kenneth S. Davis arrives at the White House and the period of Roosevelt's great domestic achievements. Taking office at a time of nationwide suffering, the Roosevelt Administration set about the task, energetically if somewhat disjointedly, of aiding farmers and protecting workers, bringing jobs to the young and security to the aged, and establishing controls over financial institutions. In fits and starts, the New Deal began to put together what a half-century later would be accepted even by conservatives as a necessary safety net for the down and out.",1986-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Even the book, which tells the ''true story'' of Jerry Rosenberg, described as ''America's greatest jailhouse lawyer,'' uses fudging techniques. It contains composite characters and identities that have been changed ''for legal reasons.'' But the movie, billed as being ''inspired by'' a true story, goes even further, twisting facts solely for the purposes of easy dramatics. What's left is a decent enough vehicle for Tony Danza, taking a brief respite from the ABC sitcom ''Who's the Boss?'' to make his debut as a ''serious'' actor, but any resemblance to a true story is almost entirely coincidental.",1986-09-23T05:00:00+0000

A five-year special inquiry into Police Department corruption headed by Julius Helfand, an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, led to 300 resignations, 22 indictments and 10 convictions. Ultimately, Mayor William O'Dwyer, himself a former policeman, resigned, as did Police Commissioner William O'Brien and Chief Inspector August Flath. 1968: Nineteen officers are indicted following an investigation by District Attorney Frank S. Hogan of Manhattan into police payoffs. Ten others were dismissed for refusing to sign waivers of immunity to testify before a grand jury. Investigators traced a pattern of cash bribes paid to policemen by gamblers for warning of impending police raids. 1972: The Knapp Commission, after a two-year investigation, calls corruption an ''extensive departmentwide phenomenon, indulged in to some degree by a sizable majority of those on the force.''",1986-09-24T05:00:00+0000

I use the brush dry, but am concerned about the moss coming back. The shingles have no finish. Should I use a solution of bleach and water, one to four, with the brush, and would a clear wood preservative inhibit growth? A.Definitely use a bleach solution in scrubbing, to help remove the growth and help prevent regrowth. I suggest a stiff bristle brush, not wire. Protect eyes with goggles. Scrub the solution on, let it dry on the surface and rinse off with lots of plain water. When the wood is completely dry, applying a good preservative that contains a water repellent will help discourage moss and mildew. Q.Our books got wet from a leaky roof, and they smell of mildew. The odor pervades the room, particularly in damp weather. Airing the room helps temporarily. Do you have any suggestions? A.A most effective cure is to open the books outside in direct sunlight. Turn the pages several times a day, for several days if possible. Sprinkling cornstarch between the pages may help. Air out other objects in the room, too - mildew odor may come from such things as the shelves that held the books.

But subsequent White House policy that no subsidies will be provided to encourage the development of commercial launching services is unrealistic and counterproductive. The 200 commercial satellites expected to be launched in the next decade are too few to create or sustain a market economy for exorbitantly expensive space launchers.

But his remarks were clearly intended to send a tough message about the Daniloff case. [ 1:4. ] A British journalist told of escaping kidnappers in the Moslem Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut.

us,Should the Government Save Vital Enterprises?,"SINCE 1970, when Congress for the first time underwrote an ailing private enterprise, the Penn Central Transporation Co., with a multibillion dollar loan guarantee, there has been debate over the appropriateness of Federal bailouts in a free-market system. Congress may soon be voting on another rescue, perhaps its most expensive, that of the $66 billion Farm Credit System, the network of small cooperative lending institutions that holds a third of the nation's $214 billion farm debt. The General Accounting Office said earlier this month that because of huge losses from defaults the system's remaining reserves will be all but wiped out this year by a record $2.9 billion loss. Most experts believe it is not a question of whether, but when the farm credit banks come to Congress for an injection of money. With the theory and practice of bailouts still in dispute, Nathaniel C. Nash, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, talked with two Senators with strongly opposed views, John Melcher, Democrat of Montana, and William Proxmire, Democrat of Montana.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE PUSHCART PRIZE XI: Best of the Small Presses. Edited by Bill Henderson. Poetry edited by Philip Levine and David Wojahn. (Pushcart Press, $26.) ''Think you know what's happening in literature today? Maybe you've been missing something,'' wrote Bill Henderson to his first ''Pushcart Prize'' readers more than a decade ago. Many discoveries later, the anthology continues to scour the literary countryside for talent. What it has come up with this year, however, is something of a puzzle. Many of the writers included have firmly established reputations in the mainstream of commercial publishing, and those newer recipients seem to be mostly aspiring versions of the former. That's not to say there isn't some fine writing here. Paul Auster's ''In the Country of Last Things'' is a haunting postapocalypse fantasy. Mona Simpson's ''Lawns'' movingly recounts a young girl's incestuous involvement with her father. ''Communist,'' a story by Richard Ford, is as well crafted as his novels. And Li-Young Lee's poem ''Eating Together'' captures the sense of loss that comes with the death of a parent. Nonfiction includes Wendell Berry's powerful critique of American nuclear defense policy, ''Property, Patriotism and National Defense,'' and Donald Barthelme's ''Not-Knowing,'' a clever, often hilarious essay on the apparent randomness of the creative process. But in general the collection seems less adventurous than it might have been, less indicative of what, under the best of circumstances, distinguishes the smaller press from the large: it provides a haven in which writers can - and often do - take risks.",1986-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,HOW I SPENT MY AEROBIC VACATION,"RESPECTING PHYSICAL FIT-ness, I am plagued by two concerns. The first is universally experienced: the fear of (and esthetic distaste for) biological atrophy. About that there isn't, really, much to be said: everyone knows that the human body needs limbering. The second concern is less widely shared. It comes to me at two levels. The first of these has to do with the dislike I feel for physical exertion. It is one thing to play tennis, ride a horse, ski, sail a boat; quite another to jog, on and on, or to push weights (up and down) or for that matter to dig a hole in the ground or to climb steep mountains. These last activities constitute, for those of us who find it most comfortable to spend one's life lying down, or sitting in a chair, effort: the equivalent of required ingestions of medicine when one is sick. Those of us who aren't Christian Scientists will take medicine to get well, and by the same token, exercise to stay well. The key to acceptable physical-fitness programs, as far as we are concerned, is brevity. There are those who get highs from prolonged exercise. You cannot take jogging away from those who ''cross the 30-to-35-minute level,'' writes Jack H. Wilmore, professor of physical and health education at the University of Texas. Well, bless them. But most of us have no intention of devoting 10 percent of our day to physical exercise, so the search for economy in exercise-time is a concern.",1986-09-28T05:00:00+0000

These officers also work out, under the direction of Col. Frederick R. Drews, head of the Army's Physical Fitness Research Institute. Colonel Drews, 56 years old, has the look of a military man - with his trim torso, erect posture and close-cropped hair - but does not always think like one. In the five years since he was summoned from academia to overhaul the Army's fitness procedures and policies, he has often clashed with the standard grit-your-teeth military conditioning theories of yore.",1986-09-28T05:00:00+0000

Others expressed skepticism about a school established expressly to train lawyers for public service. Now the school has not only held its first graduation, but also gained national recognition, winning praise from Warren E. Burger, when he was Chief Justice, for its innovative curriculum. Mr. Halpern, who had previously taught law at Stanford and Georgetown universities, recently started his last year as dean, having announced plans to write a book about his experience and to resume teaching.

She called one of them, ''Through the Panama,'' a ''tour de force of violence'' and the other, ''The Forest Path to the Spring,'' a ''true version of Paradise, as real as the hell he also knew.'' The same publisher has reissued Lowry's novel ULTRAMARINE ($7.95), the story of a Liverpool youth who ships out as a messboy on a freighter bound for the Orient. In 1962 our reviewer, Ernest Buckler, found the work, originally published 30 years earlier, ''still as green and vivid as the sea itself.'' PHILIPPE HALSMAN'S JUMP BOOK. (Abrams, $12.95.) The photographer Philippe Halsman first asked a subject to jump for him in 1953, and over the next five years he asked most of his illustrious subjects to jump before their sittings, finding that it relaxed them and that the ''jump'' photos were often more revealing than the formal portraits. The ''Jump Book,'' first published in 1959, includes text by the author and 191 gravity-defying photos of stage and screen stars, politicians, Nobel laureates and royalty.

us,OPERA: SCOTTO DOUBLES IN ''BUTTERFLY'',"RENATA SCOTTO secured herself a distinctive place in the Metropolitan Opera annals on Saturday evening by not only singing the title part in ''Madama Butterfly'' but also functioning as the production's stage director. Her vocal performance as Puccini's cruelly mistreated heroine followed a pattern we have come to expect from the soprano in the late years of a long career: ardently and shrewdly acted, though erratically and sometimes painfully sung. She was in her best current voice on this red-letter occasion, however, which means she produced acceptably pleasing tones when the voice's extremely wide tremolo could be held under control in light lyric passages. When put under dramatic pressure, it turned hard and at times nasty, as at the fortissimo conclusion of Cio-Cio-San's ''Un bel di, vedremo.'' Like many a canny veteran, she knew how to direct one's attention to dramatic niceties rather than pure vocalism.",1986-09-29T05:00:00+0000

Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain condition that causes memory loss and affects mainly the elderly. Some studies have found no traces of aluminum in the brains of Alzheimer's patients; others have revealed other substances such as bromine, mercury and silicon, Dr. Wekstein said. This has led scientists to believe that the disease may break down the barrier that normally prevents metals from reaching the brain. People consume aluminum every day in their drinking water, canned food and food cooked in aluminum pans, Dr. Wekstein said, adding that there is no reason to avoid it. Q.Could an individual ant be expected to survive if it was removed from its colony and placed in a foreign one of the same species? A.The ant would probably be killed or chased away from the foreign colony, according to Dr. David Inouye, professor of zoology at the Unversity of Maryland. Among social insects such as ants and bees, he said, each individual colony has a specific odor produced by pheromones, substances secreted by the insects to convey information and to produce certain responses.",1986-09-30T05:00:00+0000
