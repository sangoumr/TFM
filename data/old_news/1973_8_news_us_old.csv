us,The Screen: 'Dillinger':Oates Plays Title Role in Film by Milius,"John Milius, the 29-year-old enfant terrible who wrote and directed ""Dillinger,"" appears to be confused in his loyalties in this latest focus on the legendary Public Enemy No. 1, which opened at the Cinerama and other houses yesterday. His gangsters are larger, funnier and fuzzier than life as obviously monstrous killers. But they also leave the impression of having been slightly martyred as they are just as monstrously mowed down by G-men and others.In making his debut as a director, Mr. Milius gives us a ""Dillinger"" that is fascinating for its speed, action and firepower. But as character studies of decidedly interesting types out of explosive history, ""Dillinger"" shoots blanks most of the time.A viewer is frequently reminded of the likes of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" as Dillinger and company rob banks and get shot up in dashes across the Depression countryside in vintage cars to vintage music ""We're in the Money,"" etc.) on a gory road that ends in Dillinger's bloody finish outside that Chicago movie house in 1934.There is, however, no full explanation of why or how Dillinger or the others took that path. They often seem to be caricatures rather than real characters. ""I sure am happy. I just want to steal people's money,"" says Dillinger in an observation indicative of some of the film's surface, tongue-in-cheek dialogue.As depicted in scenes shot in and around Enid, Okla., members of his gang (Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, et al) are callous but equally happy in their work. ""This just isn't my day,"" says one of the members before he is killed. And slaughter is the order of the day as they are cut down in their pastoral hideout, Little Bohemia, by G-men led by the gang's nemesis, the cigar-smoking Melvin Purvis, who also serves as the off-screen narrator.The Dillinger portrayed by Warren Oates is tough and homespun, if little else. He can push Baby Face Nelson around. He is sentimental about visiting his folks, and he is roughly affectionate with his girl, but the full character of the man or gangster rarely emerges.Ben Johnson comes across more vividly as the indomitable Purvis, who longs for the kind of recognition Dillinger gets. Michelle Phillips (formerly with the singers the Mamas and the Papas) is mildly effective in her debut as Dillinger's ever-loving girl. And, like most of the principals, Cloris Leachman, as the ""lady in red"" informer who helped trap Dillinger, is hardly on screen long enough to impress a viewer.""Dillinger"" does capture the look of the nineteen-thirties, but its violence dominates the scene and the players, who remain largely undefined figures on a bloody landscape.",1973-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,' Sssssss' and 'Werewolf' Blend Horror,"Skip ""The Boy Who Cried Werewolf,"" the standard, slapdash half of a new horror double bill that includes something called ""Sssssss"" (as in snake). There is some amusing business in ""Werewolf"" toward the end, as the thrashing werewolf (Kerwin Mathews) tangles with a bunch of Jesus Freaks. Bob Homel, who plays the leader, also wrote the picture.See ""Sssssss,"" a ss-surprise. Were it not for the lurid, starkly flapping windup, this would be recommended in toto as a gripping, quietly imaginative hair-curler. It is the only movie fiction I have ever seen that sustains a scholarly, informative attitude toward the world of snakes. This aspect is fascinating and chilling, as a gentle old venom researcher, Strother Martin, putters around with cobras and pythons in a country lab. His aides are his daughter and a smitten student.That's the set-up, adroitly blended into a low-budget canvas of small-town characters and a visiting carnival by Hal Dresner's script (from a story by the producer, Dan Striepeke) and by Bernard L.Kowalski's direction. About midpoint, the effective color and music subtly signal that something perfectly horrible in the human department is also uncoiling on the doctor's premises.Toned down, without the final fireworks, the picture would have emerged as a real sleeper for thriller fans, who should catch it anyway. It's certainly original. Mr. Martin does well, so does young Dirk Benedict, but the best are Jack Ging as a sheriff and Heather Menzies, a perfectly charming daughter.

us,"Very Young Love Story, 'Jeremy,' Is on Screen:The Cast","Well over two years ago, when ""Love Story"" first began making everybody connected with it rich and famous, there was a lot of talk about a romantic revivalor a revival of romancein movies. We were about to face the legions of the children of ""Love Story."" The offspring never materializedor if they did, they were so pale that you couldn't see them.But now there is one, full blown, blushing and very unashameda genuine ""Son of Love Story."" Its name is ""Jeremy,"" and it opened yesterday at Loews Tower East.It's a smaller movie than its sire, and, of course, much younger. The scene is not Harvard/Radcliffe, but something like sophomore-year High School of Music and Art. The boy is Jewish, middle-class, a musician a cellist. The girl is gentile, middle-class, a dancer.Their problem is not how to get married and live together, but rather, how to work up nerve enough to say hello to each other in public. And when they do, and when they finally acknowledge that they are in love, it is not the Grim Reaper Death who ends the tale. It's her dad, who yanks her off to Detroit with him, on his way to a better job. ""Jeremy"" is touchingly awkward, pleasantly sad. It is not exactly a desperate movie.However, it is a movie of rather heavy calculation, indulging almost every clich available to young love in Manhattanthe city at night, rainy afternoons, the camera floating over Park Avenue, or looking up through the sun-dappled leaves of Central Park. Like the advice of Jeremy's wise old cello teacher (e.g. ""The music expresses life! Play it that way.""), they deal not so much with experience as in preordained states of mind.But in the long run ""Jeremy"" is less committed to its clichs than to its kids. It may be dull about the glamour of the city strets, but about the agony of calling up a girl for the first time just to make a date it is right on target. It specializes not in tragedy, but in a kind of bittersweet discomfort  which is true and moving, in spite of all the efforts to jack up its appeal.An aura of not-quite professionalism surrounds ""Jeremy,"" generally saving it from its own slickness, and validating a number of decent, tentative performances like that of Glynnis O'Connor as the girl, Susan.As Jeremy, Robby Benson faces the problem of any clever kid playing a klutzy kidbright, sensitive, original, and rather a jerkand I think he handles it admirably. I don't know how complete an actor he'll be one day, but in this performance he virtually shapes everything that matters in the movie.Arthur Barron is the writer and director of record for ""Jeremy,"" but there has been notice given in the trade press to an assertion by Joseph Brooks, a New York film and TV music composer, that the movie is in some measure his. I can't pretend to sort out the claimsnot too unique in the busines of movie makingbut it seems fair to suggest that in whatever proportion, both men were involved in the authorship of the film.",1973-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"' Maurie,' Basketball Star's Story, Opens","As a potentially inspirational saga that respects the awesome truth that generated it, ""Maurie,"" now at Loews State and Cine Theaters is, unfortunately, rarely moving as drama. The heroism, tragedy and friendship of Maurice Stokes, the black basketball star destined to die, and his white teammate, Jack Twyman, formerly of the Cincinnati Royals, evolves on screen with largely soap-opera effects.Fans, of course, will recall that Stokes was incapacitated and hospitalized after a head injury, and Jack Twyman selflessly spent 10 years raising the many thousands of dollars for the attempts to rehabilitate his friend before he finally succumbed three years ago.But Daniel Mann's direction is uninspired, and the script by Douglas Morrow, who won an Oscar for another story stemming from the sports world, ""The Stratton Story,"" has not effectively transplanted much of what was real and affecting in the Stokes-Twyman story into touching movie terms.His principals are characters obviously injured by the fates, but they are rarely equal to the shattering true circumstances into which they have been plunged.Further explanations are called for from the script that doesn't develop its characters completely and seems pointed mostly toward tear jerking. Bo Swenson as Twyman, is sincere and stalwart in his devotion as Stokes's official guardian and Bernie Casey is dignified as the stricken Stokes.Janet MacLachlan is pretty and unassuming as his persevering girl, and Stephanie Edwards is natural as Twyman's understanding wife. But as a dramatization of unusual, affecting real human drama, ""Maurie"" only occasionally stirs the heart or mind.",1973-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"' Le Sex Shop' Sells the Devil's Merchandise, Purely","With two growing kids, a loving wife who nevertheless likes to spend money and a public that seems to have called it quits on reading, Claude (Claude Berri) doesn't need much persuading to close down his bookstore and, on a successful friend's advice (""Proust or 'Positions,' a book's a book""), to reopen it as a sex shop.So he finds himselfthis small, quiet, balding Parisianthe chief proprietor in a world of potency pills, personal vibrators, leather goods and specialized magazines catering to a number of preferences and peculiarities that are 90 per cent news to him.His horizons expandinto one embarrassment after anotherwith a wife-swapping dentist (Jean-Pierre Mariello) and the dentist's swappable wife (Nathalie Delon), at a group-sex night spot, on board a Mediterranean cruise sponsored by a love club, with his father-in-law and mother-in-law, as companions. Here, through the entire course of a petit-bourgeois Walpurgisnacht, he never does quite manage the infidelity it seems his social obligation to commit.These adventures, an hour and a half of them, make up Claude Berri's ""Le Sex Shop""a French name, like ""Le Drugstore""  which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater.As a nonfan, from way back, of Claude Berri (""The Two of Us,"" ""Marry Me! Marry Me!""), I was interested in seeing how he would treat material not as susceptible to the sentimental sweetness that has been his trademark and, for me, his greatest liability. On the whole, he treats it very respectfully.But he hasn't really dropped the sweetness. He has only modified it to encompass sadism, masochism, fetishism, voyeurism, old men who like young girls and young girls who like other girls  the whole sexual revolution that is greeted by some with rage, by others with delight and by Claude Berri with a kind of gentle, sympathetic tolerrance.This may sound like transcendent virtue, but it is not. Berri's cinema, never sharp enough for satire, is also never exalted enough for transcendence. If you were to reduce Blake's ""everything that lives is holy"" to something like ""everybody is ultimately a nice guy,"" you would have a reasonable formula for the drabness of Berri's film.There are moments of real pleasure in ""Le Sex Shop."" There are a lot of really marvelous girls, including Juliet Berto as the wife, Beatrice Romand as the sex-shop salesgirl and the excellent Nathalie Delon. As a type, Claude Berri must be just what he wanted in a leading manthough I wish he had better ideas for what to do with himself, how to turn himself into the deadpan comedian he isn't but apparently means to be.The X rating that accompanies this film is an absurditybased on a few bared breasts, one (simulated) position, 10 vibrators and a chastity belt. ""Le Sex Shop"" may deal in the Devil's merchandise, but its soul is as pure (too pure) as the driven snow.",1973-08-03T05:00:00+0000

Magee, a big-time Miami sports-car dealer, merely squeezes a few more drops of self-pitying rage  like something left over from his role in ""A Clockwork Orange."" As for Miss O'Neill, as Magee's daughter and Miami's most important trader in hot diamonds; and Donald Sutherland, as the happy-go-lucky insurance investigator who tracks her down  well, they mainly smile a lot and look very healthy. But the look of healthdewy tan for Miss O'Neill; blue-eyed bronze for Mr. Sutherland  might have been poured out of a bottle. So might everything else in ""Lady Ice,"" which carries the American feature movie a bold step closer to the condition of a Florida orange-juice commercial.I'm not really opposed to synthetics, however, and every so often, when it gets far enough away from its characters, ""Lady Ice"" takes on the mute, appealing pathos of a travel poster. But when it gets close to its characterseven to the spectacularly beautiful Miss O'Neill  who talk without communicating and touch as if without ever making contact, it gives up everything to the development of a plot that makes no sense and the intimation of a lifestyle that you couldn't keep fresh even under Saran Wrap.Everything in the film leans to the conventionalthe sex, the violence, the thrills, the anger, the cool. Some nice conventional movies have been made in this way. But ""Lady Ice"" never discovers how the conventions live, only that they die, and so it becomes kind of a sun-drenched, breeze-swept, palm-laden, sea-sparkled reminder of lost delights and failed powers.",1973-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Undersea Tale: Neptune Factor' Opens at Neighborhoods,"With the subtitle ""An Undersea Odyssey"" and with a musical score that sounds as if it might have been written by a brother-in-law of Richard Strauss's chambermaid, ""The Neptune Factor"" isn't exactly shy about claiming its parentage. Like many other claims of parentage, this one should be taken with a grain of salt.What ""The Neptune Factor"" is really about is a search and rescue mission to save three aquanauts trapped by an undersea earthquake on the ocean floor somewhere off the coast of Nova Scotia. Down, down the rescuers descend  Ben Gazzara, Yvette Mimieux, Ernest Borgnine and Donnelly Rhodes  led by the faintest ray of hope (and rather forcibly pushed by Miss Mimieux, who plans to marry one of the aquanauts), until at last. . . .Until at last they plumb the nethermost ocean depths and enter what I do believe is an oversized tabletop aquarium. Gargantuan goldfish, enormous sea horses, earth-shaking lobsters, man-eating softshell crabs  from every side the terrors of the sea approach them, torment their submersible craft, the Neptune, until at last. . . .Until at last  they either find their colleagues, or they don't. Anyone willing to sit through 90 minutes of this in order to find out probably does not really know and shouldn't have his suspense ruined. My own pleasure in ""The Neptune Factor"" begins and ends with the miniature photography  as nutty as anything I've seen in recent movies  and with the eliciting from Ben Gazzara, as the steely leader of the mission, Comdr. Adrian Blake of Atlanta, what may be filmdom's most confidently unconvincing Southern accent.Directed by Daniel Petrie, ""The Neptune Factor"" is largely the work of Canadian film makers.

Ordnance Depot 35 miles west of Utah's capital has stirred protests from the Utah residents and officials concerned by the hazards they see in such a 600mile rail movement. Secretary of the Army Howard H. Callaway, visiting here Thursday, told Goy. Calvin L Rampton that the Army was many months away from a final decision on shipping several trainloads of canisters containing GB nerve gas from Colorado to Utah. He promised full public hearings and safety studies before shipments would be authorized. The planning to move the gas came after intense public pressure in the Denver area, where the risk of storing thousands of metal containers of toxic materials near the flight paths of that city's Stapleton Airport have long been questioned. The reaction in Utah against dumping Colorado gas on us stems in part from bitterness following the death in 1968 of 6,400 sheep at the Army's Dugway Proving Grounds in western Utah. Those deaths, first disclaimed by the military, were belatedly proved to have been caused by a poorly placed drop of a nerve gas called VX from a low flying plane during tests 30 miles from Tooele.",1973-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Cosmetic changes can help them continue their traditional function of a modest summer retreat. Zoning complications and economy were the factors that saved this beach shack from the bulldozers. Architect Hobart Betts had purchased the little house (water poured in through the roof when it rained, he remembers, and it was near collapse) primarily for the property. It is a stretch of ocean dunes in the Hamptons. But the existing lot was too small to conform to the current zoning requirements and a variance would have been needed to build on it. Then too, says the architect, the children loved itthey liked the idea of its being a shack and became upset when it started to become neat and precise. Betts resurfaced the roof, exterior and interior surfaces throughout but stayed strictly within the shell of the existing building. Modest from the exterior, the house boasts cedarpaneled walls offset by white woods insidecool and inviting in summer, cozy and Intimate through fall and winter.",1973-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Fra Junipero Serra, fondly nursing an ulcerating wound in hopes of sainthood, rode north from Mexico to found a string of adobe missions, converting the Indians by enslaving them, saving them for the Gringos to eradicate a hundred years later in one vast genocidal convulsion.

(Columbia KC 32252). What does one of our most talented young songwriters have in common with the Oscarwinning representative of showbiz tradition? On his new album, rather than using his own material, Nilsson plunges into the past to sing his favorite standards with Gordon Jenkins arrangemeats that are as contemporary as World War IL On paper it might look like a good, or at least amusing, idea, but on record it's a bore. And to see where Nilsson's gone wrong one need only listen to Grey. Even though Grey may not suit my particular musical tastes, he is being true to himself whereas Nilsson is not. Before I attack Nilsson's latest effort, let me say that I enjoy hearing the standards he does like It Had To Be You and You Made Me Love You just as much as songs by Leon Russell or Carly Simon or Chuck Berry. Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and Fred Astaire take frequent rides around my turntable, and that probably explains why I don't appreciate A Little Touch of Sclunilsson In The Night As skilled a writer as Nilsson is, he just doesn't have the vocal ability to do As Time Goes By or What'll I Do justice.",1973-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Epstein, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, warned yesterday that the movie a rock musical about the events leading to the crucifixion of Jesus, could result in increased anti-Semitism by its emphasis on the role of the Jews in the death of Jesus.And the American Jewish Committee has compiled critical comments about the film from Jewish and Christian leaders around the country that it plans to make public this morning to coincide with the movie's opening at six metropolitan-area theatres.In his prepared statment, Mr. Epstein said that ""the movie's sharp and vivid emphasis on a Jewish mob's demand to kill Jesus can feed into the kind of disparagement of Jews and Judaism which has always nurtured anti-Jewish prejudice and bigotry.""""Even the casting is of the most primitive type,"" Mr. Epstein said. ""Anyone who has ever seen cowboy films knows that the good guys wear white hats and the bad guys wear black. Here the actor portraying Jesus is blond; Judas is black; the priests and rabbis are dark-haired, foreboding, and garbed in black."" The role of Jesus is played by Ted Neeley. Carl Anderson plays Judas in the film.Reasons GivenThe A.D.L. director said his organization would not be so concerned if the movie were not likely to attract ""large numbers of impressionable young people"" by its ""exciting rock format and beautiful photography,"" or if ""people were emotionally healthy and free prom prejudice.""However, he said, the change that the Jews killed Jesus is still a basic cause of anti-Semitism in the world, although ""Christian leaders themselves have repeatedly condemned as reprehensible the notion that Jews, rather than all mankind, are responsible for Jesus' death.""For its part, the American Jewish Committee is especially concerned about the effect of the movie's message when it goes into worldwide distribution to such areas as South America, the Middle East and Italy. The A.J.C. will make public today suggestions to ""mitigate damage"" from the film's release.Norman Jewison, the director, co-producer and screenplay collaborator on the movie, is vacationing in Canada and could not be reached for comment on the latest round of criticism about ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""Company Issues StatementIn a prepared statement, Universal Pictures, which is releasing the movie, described ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" as ""a rock opera, a musical entertainment, not a religious tract.""""With every respect for the sincerity and concern expressed,"" Universal's prepared statement continued, ""we do not believe their views to be supported by the content of the film or shared by the many millions who have listened to the music or viewed the concert and stage presentations throughout the world since 1970.""When the stage production opened in October, 1971, it was criticized not only by some Jews as anti-Semitic, but also by some Catholics and Protestants as blasphemous in its portrayal of Jesus as a young man who might even be interested in sex.

us,White Lightning' Strikes Local Houses,"""White Lightning,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is a fairly awful movie that keeps producing good thingsscenes, performances, moments of insightthat seem connected to better ideas than anything suggested in the film's larger intentions. There are enough of those good things so that I shouldn't mind seeing more work directed by Joseph Sargent, or written by William Norton, or featuring such performers as Jennifer Billingsley, Ned Beatty or Matt Clark.In form, ""White Lightning"" is straightforward revenge melodrama. Gator McKlusky (Burt Reynolds), a convicted Arkansas moonshiner, is let out of prison so he can help establish evidence for a Federal case against a particularly evil and law-breaking small-town sheriff (Ned Beatty). But Gator has his own reasons, the sheriff's killing of his college-student kid brother mainly because the boy wore his hair long and espoused good government, and he means to get more than evidence.For reasons that I'm sure are clearer to the producers than they are to me, half of this action involves endless car chases, which are a crushing bore. The other half involves human relationsbetween Gator and the wild girl (Miss Billingsley) he is attracted to, between Gator and the helpless whisky runner (Matt Clark) he makes use ofand sometimes these are very interesting indeed.Burt Reynolds may by now have a bare-chest clause in his contract, because you see a lot of his bare chestfor example, in flirtation scenes with Miss Billingsley where you don't see any of hers. What you do see of her is a rather complex and subtle characterization of a girl more vulnerable than she seems. In fact, all the local types, like Matt Clark, Bo Hopkins, or R. G. Armstrong (all in the moonshine business) are more complete and more resilient than the situation strictly demands.Ned Beatty makes of Sheriff Connors one of those bland phlegmatic manifestations of evil that have from time to time been such a specialty of the South as shown in American movies. And there are sequences involving himsome of the best take place inside the sheriff's office  that seem unexpectedly intricate and cleverly paced, and on the way to rather exciting film making.",1973-08-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Suspenseful 'Night Watch',"Elizabeth Taylor, and about time, has got herself a good picture and a whodunit at that. More than one Music Hall patron seemed to be stumbling from the first showing of ""Night Watch"" yesterday in stunned delight at the windup, a gorgeously brazen, logical swindle.Seldom, at least recently, has a mystery carpet-yanking been so effective, especially after a familiar suspense setup that seems to be carelessly shedding red herrings. This is the one about the rich, jittery wife who howls murder about the empty old house next door. She saysor thinksshe has seen two bloodied corpses, at intervals, through the window.Well, has she? Or is she cracking up? There is much solicitous tiptoeing around the frenzied Miss Taylora bit too muchby her stockbroker husband, Laurence Harv???y, and her best friend, Billie Whitelaw. A snippy, garden-digging neighbor, Robert Lang, handles a spade most ably. An unctuous psychiatrist drifts in, as does an airy cook and a caustic, impatient police inspector.All this seems fairly old stuff, with an insistent Miss Taylor clearly about to pop her cork, with outside help. Something else pops, and you'll never guess what unless you saw Lucille Fletcher's original play starring Joan Hackett.The Broadway hit had a swank, one-set, Manhattan town house and a larger, more raffish gallery of suspects. Tony Williamson's adaptation trims the cast to a handful, and shifts the locale to luxury digs in London.With fewer people under close camera scrutiny, beautiful color photography and Miss Taylor agonizing in some dazzling Valentina finery, it's easy to play a smug Sherlock. But the glossy intimacy only deepens the surprise of the climax, a hair-raising stalk in the house next door, yeastily directed by Brian G. Hutton.Miss Taylor churns up a fine, understandable lather of nerves. Mr. Harvey is properly sleek, Miss Whitelaw makes a peppery parrot, and Mr. Lang is neat. The deliciously cunning postscript may make you feel like a perfect fool. Once in a while it's fun.",1973-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'Gordon's War' Views Drug Scene,"In ""Gordon's War,"" four black veterans of Vietnam wage fierce personal battle, using Army tactics, against drug channelers in Harlem. What, indeed, could be more admirable? This is a worthy film, whose format and substancea black theme dramatized, for practical, constructive purposesremain exceeded by its goal.The picture is tough, fast, moves in a straight line with no sideline fiddling but with pungent humor and vividly jabs the crime-ridden underbelly of Harlem. The sharp direction of Ossie Davis catches the argot, the flavor and the sinister ambiance of the area. And Mr. Davis stages a wingding of a car-motorcycle chase near the end.But the picture is inconclusive, far from profound, and the urgency of the theme has been overly simplified to fit the action. Only in the first part of the script is there character probing, as Paul Winfield (of ""Sounder"") broods over the addiction of his dead wife and recruits his three pals for personal and moral vengeance. A real uptown dope purge, says somebody, ""would take an army.""These fourCarl Lee, David Dowling and Tony King are the othersdo very well on their own. Fiercely, methodically, the good guys nail the bad guys, with comparative ease. No policeman or detective, black or white, ever appears. At the fade-out, which simply hangs in midair like a warning, four white business executives are lined up as the culprits. ""Gordon's War"" is well-fought but definitely not the drug war to end them all.",1973-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:New 'Visions of Eight' Studies Olympics,"""Visions of Eight,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema I, is an attempt by an international group of eight mostly well-known directors to deal with individual aspects of last summer's Munich Olympic Games. The attempt was surely doomed to failure. In a film of this kind there is no way of dealing with the event that shaped the 20th Olympiador deprived it of all shape: the killing of 11 members of the Israeli team.That event does figure, by way of fairly inappropriate montage, in John Schlesinger's otherwise lovely meditation on the running of the marathon. And it hangs like a pall over Avery Brundage's farewell remarks inviting everybody to the 1976 Olmpics. Once admitted (as Brundage seemed unwilling to do), it cannot be integrated in the context of a movie that only wants to be thoughtful, funny, satiric or poetic.But ""Visions of Eight"" fails in more immediate ways, largely because several of the eight didn't have such interesting visions. Arthur Penn and Kon Ichikawa do not so much film as analyze, respectively, the pole vault and the 100-meter dash. You don't see a race or a jump; you see the way the flesh bunches on a runner's face or the curve a pole makes in rising. Everything is slowed down to the speed of ""poetry in motion.""By contrast, almost everything is speeded up in Milos Forman's satiric vignette intercutting the decathlon with shots of musical groups, ranging from some sort of cowbell band to a full-scale performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Nobody escapes the witless humor, and Forman, usually a fine director, has turned in the worst sequence in the film.Not everything is this bad. Claude Lelouch's study of the losers shows some athletes in real pain, some merely befuddled (like competing swimmers staring in disbelief at the retreating form of Mark Spitz) and has at least the virtues of canny documentary.And there are parts of Mai Zetterling's sequence on weight-lifting or the West German Michael Pfleghar's tribute to women in the Olympics, in which concentration on athletic performance overcomes the impulse to fancy film-making and results in work of real quality.Pfleghar devotes a few minutes to a very young Soviet gymnast, Ludmilla Tourischeva, both standing by herself and working on the uneven parallel bars, and those are perhaps the most beautiful, least assertive, moments in the movie.I also liked the long closing sequence to ""Visions of Eight,"" which is uncredited, but which I understand is largely the work of John Schlesinger. As for so much of the rest, it seems to forget that it is the privilege of the modest art of film to find the meaning of things just in the way they are seen to be.",1973-08-11T05:00:00+0000

In three weeks, Joe (King) Roman Puerto Rico will be fighting George Foreman in Tokyo for the world heavyweight title. But his manager, Bill Daly, got him there, not his record. Bill Daly is 74 years old now. His hair is thin, but most of it is still brown. The toughness is still in his Irish face, the toughness that comes from having survived in boxing for more than 50 years. As a kid in New Jersey he learned how to survive by Working for Jack (Doc) Kearns, who was Jack Dempsey's manager. Much later he was around Frankie Carbo and Blinky Palermo, but he survived a Senate investigation into boxing. Through the years he handled several famous fighters.

us,About the Mets:,"This weekend may mark the last appearance of Willie Mays in San Francisco as an active player, just as his pinchhitting appearance in Los Angeles Thursday night may have been his farewell to Dodger Stadium. Willie batted for Jerry Koosman, leading off the ninth, and grounded out. He had to be tagged at first because the throw was wide, and had the wind knocked out of him, causing momentary alarm as first aid arrived, but he emerged uninjured. Although the Mets lost to the Dodgers, they did have the satisfaction of seeing one tough inning work out according to plan. While the game was still scoreless in the fifth, two singles and a sacrifice gave the Dodgers men on second and third with one out and the head of the batting order coming up. With the infield in, Koosman made Dave Lopes hit a handleable grounder Felix Milian for the second out. But now Manny Mota, righthanded batter hitting .331, was up against the lefthanded Koosman with two runners in scoring position, be followed by Willie Davis, who bats lefthanded. After a summit conference it was decided to pitch to Mota instead of walking him, and Mota did produce a thirdout grounder. The decision looked even better when Davis led off the next inning with a hit. The Dodgers, who started the season badly but came on strong, have drawn about 1,550,000 so far. The Giants, who started off great and then slumped, have drawn about 600,000 Conclusion: the Dodgers are better at selling tickets than the Giants.",1973-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Jack Gregory, defensive end: He looks more agile than he's ever been. Maybe it's because he's been injuryfree so far. There's no doubt he's the best in the game today. I think he's the best of all time.. Continued swelling in the left knee leaves Clifton Davis, the rookie fullback, questionable for Sunday's game....

Then, too, he is an aristocrat while Jenkins is merely a gentleman, the son of an army officer, with a living to make. The difference is greater than it might appear to innocent Americans.

It brings the odor of the earth and of green vegetation to the nostrils, the cry of the peacock and the call of the koel to the ear. There is also the Raga Desha which invokes scenes of merrymaking, of swings in mango groves, and the singing and laughter of girls. Most Indian palaces of the past had specially designed balconies from which noblemen viewed the monsoon downpour. Here they sat listening to court musicians improvising their own versions of monsoon melodies, sipping wine and making love to the ladies of their harem. The most common theme in Indian songs is the longing of lovers for each other when the rains are in full swing.

Airline people have always claimed that only 10 per cent of the American population flies at all, but this can't be so. Ten per cent of current census figures would come to close to 25 million, which would mean that practically everybody is scared. And if this should be true, surely by now the airlines would have done something about it, rather than merely impoverish their imaginations by dreaming up further variations in frozen food and piano lounges. Or maybe not, for the problem is not so easily dealt with, being philosophical rather than, as recently suggested in these pages, psychological or pharmaceutical. Fear of flying is no more neurotic or physiological than fear of death, its first cousin once removed. If there is alleviation it lies in confrontation, not suppression, and I believe, if I may say so, that I have stumbled onto something that may make things a little easier for all of us.

Or so goes the standard explanation of the phenomenon. As the sun moves higher in the cloudless sky of May and June, it heats the atmosphere over the Indian plains. The theory is that when the hot air rises and leaves a vast lowpressure zone below it, enormous amounts of warm, wet air rush into the breach from the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. These winds continue blowing northeast across the subcontinent. Along the way, their clouds may dump water on some places and pass over others, but the real downpours occur when the winds encounter the high Himalayas in northern India and, as a consequence, rise to cooler altitudes, where their vapor condenses into water. Much of the wind is then deflected toward the northwest and travels along the Ganges and the barrier",1973-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Where to turn happens to be to the side of the poor rioting farmers, aided by the rice-carrying mounted coolies (led by Toshiro Mifune). Once united, the poor and the middle classes are invincibleaided by the mounted cooliesand despite overwhelming opposition, they are able to reinstate the Gion Festival, expressing in music and pageantry the people's aspirations.A romantic subplot accompanies the march of public events. The plot shows how young Shinkichi (Kinnosuke Nakamura), a dyer by trade and leader of the Kyoto artisans, learns from Ayame, a beautiful flutist, how to play the Gion Festival music. Without the music there can be no festival. Shinkichi and Ayame fall in love.The daughter of an outcast gardener, Ayame compensates for her bitter and humble lot by affecting a new and ever more dazzling change of kimonos for every scene in which she appears.

Not content with her kimonos, her musical talent or even with Shinkichi, she needs reassurance:""You think I'm beautiful?""""Yes.""""You know nothing about me, so you think I'm beautiful.""
