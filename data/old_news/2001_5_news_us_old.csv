Manufacturing led gross domestic product down, with a 0.9 percent drop, and production of electrical and electronic equipment fell 9.1 percent, the worst reversal in 40 years. ''Major customers, primarily from the United States, continued to curtail spending, sparking significant production cutbacks and layoffs by key Canadian producers,'' said Statistics Canada, the government's reporting agency.

The work requirement would be increased to 30 hours a week from 20 for parents of older children. Part of the bill would make it easier for welfare recipients to fulfill their weekly work quota by counting hours spent in job training and education classes toward the work-for-benefits requirement.

But within a few months it became clear that something was missing: visitors. Consultants had predicted a first-year attendance of 460,000. Instead, only 320,000 people showed up, and just 120,000 of them went on the much-vaunted multimedia virtual tour of the world's wine regions - billed as the main event in the 100,000-square-foot museum. Major losses in its first year did little to cheer the 550 impatient shareholders who had put up $39 million. Duncan Vaughan-Arbuckle, the founder and president of Vinopolis, said the museum's problems have been part marketing misfire, part misunderstanding by industry insiders. ''Nobody knows what we are, or who we are for, and our marketing campaigns have not helped,'' he said. ''People saw our first campaign, with the tag line 'Taste. Explore. Enjoy,' and thought we were elitist.'' In truth, Vinopolis is clearly designed to entertain the masses. In addition to a lively audio guide, there are atmospheric videos about winemaking around the world; olfactory kiosks that teach visitors to use their nose to tell corked from moldy, and chardonnay from chenin blanc; a hair-raising virtual ride through the Chianti region of Italy; and of course, plenty of wine to sniff, swirl, sip, spit or swallow. Indeed, Vinopolis may be one of the few museums where visitors grow merrier as they walk through: the $16 admission includes five glasses of wine. Happily, thanks to improved pedestrian access and the new Jubilee Line subway station nearby, there is no need to designate a driver. Vinopolis, 1 Bank End, London SE1.

In June 1980, as the building was being completed, he would never have imagined adding, ''party spot for hire to fashion victims.'' But there they were, 2,000 of them dancing to the electronic music of Daft Punk at a bash sponsored by the Italian fashion company Prada.

Mr. Neimeyer, 94, who won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1988, is a true modernist, recognized for the sensuality of his curvaceous forms. His buildings are often composed inside and out of glass, cement, ceramics and steel. The main conference room with metal slates hanging vertically on the walls (above) is situated below ground level and has Niemeyer desks and chairs. The room's dome (left) is on the lawn in front of the curved six-story main building, sheathed in glass.

Mr. Schundler, a Republican who is running for governor, said he hoped to install more than 100 cameras across the city. An opponent of the cameras, Glenn Cunningham, a former United States marshal who is running for mayor, said he would remove them if elected.

Edward MacDonald of Las Vegas is the president of St. Stephen's Baptist Church, the owner of 50 properties in Harlem that were acquired under a federally insured mortgage program open only to nonprofit groups or people who intend to live in their homes. In documents filed last month in United States District Court in Central Islip, N.Y., an investigator for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said that although St. Stephen's ''purports to be an active church,'' no mail is delivered to the address it lists in Newport Beach. A spokesman for Mr. MacDonald, the 19th person arrested in the case, said he would plead not guilty to the charges. Mr. MacDonald is accused of participating in at least four transactions in 1998 involving properties in Harlem that were bought and quickly resold for a much higher price, a practice known as flipping. According to the court documents, St. Stephen's claimed that the down payments were coming from its own funds when the money actually came from real estate speculators and lawyers, who also paid Mr. MacDonald $5,000 for each property he bought.

That verdict was set aside, but the Appellate Division later ordered a new trial, a decision that the attorney general's office asked Justice Doyle to dismiss.

us,World Business Briefing | Europe: Britain: Telecom Stake Sale,"Desperate to reduce $43 billion in debt, British Telecommunications said it would raise $500 million by selling its 33 percent stake in the Maxis Communications mobile phone operator of Malaysia to Usaha Tegas, the company's largest shareholder. The announcement followed British Telecom's $6.9 billion sale this week of stakes in major Japanese and Spanish wireless businesses to its rival Vodafone. Investors also expect British Telecom to embark on an emergency rights issue of new equity to raise about $7 billion as it seeks to cut debt by one-third. The discounted rights issue would be the biggest in Britain's corporate history, eclipsing a similar move this week by Vodafone, which raised $5 billion to finance its acquisitions in Japan and Spain.

Judge Eugene Serpentelli said he feared the tigers might be harmed if moved and ruled that the animals could remain while an appeals court considers the larger question of whether the state has the authority to shut down her facility.

Thaba, 66, one of the best-known healers in the area, begins by ''throwing the dollars,'' casting small pieces of bones like dice. This ritual helps Thaba divine the nature of the patient's disease. If he decides, for instance, that the patient suffers from asthma, he waves a horsetail (bottom left) over his head to help him breathe. For most ailments, he prepares a muti, a Sotho word meaning ''medicine,'' usually in liquid or lotion form. Many of the ingredients come from the leaves and bark of local plants, ground with a mortar and pestle (top center, next to a good-luck mask) or cow horn (bottom right) and distilled in water or alcohol or mixed with fat or Vaseline. Then there's the aspirin. ''For headache, I take something like Pando-Co,'' Thaba says, referring to over-the-counter pills containing acetaminophen and codeine, ''then mix it with my muti.'' He claims his mutis make Western medicines, like aspirin and cough syrup, much stronger. ''We used to send people to the hospital or a private doctor, but they don't get better,'' Thaba says. ''I am the only one who can stop their disease.'' Matthew Steinglass",2001-05-06T05:00:00+0000

That scary ''Jaws'' theme feels especially appropriate with the arrival of two books recounting a series of fatal shark attacks that terrorized the Jersey Shore in the summer of 1916, events that in fact inspired ''Jaws.'' The books, ''Close to Shore,'' by Michael Capuzzo (Broadway Books, $24.95), and ''Twelve Days of Terror,'' by Richard G. Fernicola, M.D. (Lyons Press, $27.95), describe the furor that started when a man was mauled in the ocean off Beach Haven and ended when a great white shark was caught in Raritan Bay. Though Beach Haven officials, perhaps fearful of frightening off tourists, did not notify officials, sharks came to steal headlines from a World War and established themselves as a symbol of predatory terror. The Fernicola book is that of a scientific researcher, while Mr. Capuzzo's is more novelistic, even presenting the shark's point of view. Both lay out a background of grand seaside resorts and the relatively new fashion of beachgoing, with rumblings of war across the water that for a while held a much more immediate threat.",2001-05-06T05:00:00+0000

But this old-style map making is not appropriate this time around. The census shows that over the last decade New York has lost population upstate and gained population downstate.

On May 4, after a long and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. Dr. So would have been 67 on June 1. Dr. So received his medical degree cum laude from the University of Santo Tomas in 1959. He then became a ''Gold Medalist'' intern at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines for two years. In 1961 he did a second internship at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, PA. Henry then accepted a residency at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. He completed his general surgical residency in 1966. At that time he was recognized as an outstanding graduate and continued his training at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo. He achieved the status of a pediatric surgeon at that time. Dr. So returned to Manila where he became chief of pediatric surgery at the University of Santo Tomas. On June 1, 1970, he married Dr. Flora (Te) a pediatric surgeon who received her training in Philadelphia under the guidance of Dr. C. Koop. The family returned to New York in 1973. In 1974 Dr. So became a member of BSK Pediatric Surgical Associates. He was an honored member of this practice for 20 years. He was a member of many medical societies, but his proudest was The American Pediatric Surgical Association. Dr. So was on the staff of many hospitals and was chosen to be the chief of the division of pediatric surgery at Northshore University Hospital in Manhasset, LI. He was the first to perform a procedure for the cure of Hirschsprung's Disease in the newborn without the need for a colostomy. He reported this procedure in 1980 and is now performed by most pediatric surgeons worldwide. Besides his devotion to family, patients and collegues he will be remembered for his singing of the ''oldies'' in the operating room and of course his great love for his garden. I met Henry on a Monday morning in 1974, I took him on rounds. My mother-in-law, with whom I lived, met him as well, and she fell in love with him. Why not? He was a Chinse doctor who spoke Yiddish to her. On a handshake he started his career the next day and it was the best decision we ever made. A soft spoken, gentle soul, you could not help being touched by him and it lasted forever. In all our daily lives he represented the best and will be dearly missed.

I had to pawn my house and a plot of land in Vitoria to raise the $8,000 needed to pay the coyotes that smuggled me to the United States. But I didn't find a job when I got here. Instead, I ended up in this health center after being detained by an immigration officer. The doctors took an X-ray and found a spot in my lungs. They told me I had to stay in isolation, that I might have to stay here two months. All I could think was that I was going to die in this cold place, away from my kids. But I know I'm not sick. My brother had a lung removed due to resistant tuberculosis. I'm not coughing like my brother. I am not wasted away like him. They gave me a Bible in Portuguese, so I read all the time. I also watch TV a lot. There's not much else to do. The worst part is falling asleep. I keep on thinking about my debts, my disease, my kids. I don't know what I'm going to do.""

Instead, I ended up in this health center after being detained by an immigration officer. The doctors took an X-ray and found a spot in my lungs. They told me I had to stay in isolation, that I might have to stay here two months. All I could think was that I was going to die in this cold place, away from my kids. But I know I'm not sick. My brother had a lung removed due to resistant tuberculosis. I'm not coughing like my brother. I am not wasted away like him. They gave me a Bible in Portuguese, so I read all the time.

Mary earned a B.A. in History from the College of New Rochelle in 1934. She was ma rried to the late Ralph Herbert Bell from July 16, 1943, until his de ath on June 4, 1995. Mary had a brief but memorable career as a fift h grade teacher at Epiphany School in the early 1960's, but her true life's work outside of the home was volunteer service to others. Mary was devoted to her alma mater. On June 7, 1969, she was a warded the Ursula Laurus Citation by the College of New Rochell e ''honoring alumnae who have provided outstanding leadership and have demonstrated selfless and generous devotion in furthering high ideals and rich traditions of Ursuline education.'' On June 2, 1979, Mary received the highest award given by the College of New Rochelle, the Angela Merici Medal. She is responsible, along with her late hu sband, for a scholarship fund at the College, and for the Ralph H. Bell Reading Room in the new College library. She served as the Class o f 1934, fund agent for over twenty years and was a longtime member of the Board of Directors of the Alumnae Association. Mary was an active leader in Epiphany Parish for over fifty years. When, in 1964, the church building was destroyed by fire, she helped raise funds to b uild the present church. She was a Trustee of the Parish for fou r years. Mary was a founding Board member and the first chairperson of the Board of FISH (Friends in Service to the Housebound) at Epiphany Parish. She gave tirelessly to this effort for many years an d helped bring comfort, sustenance and companionship to countle ss housebound people. The March of Dimes, American Association o f University Women and the Ladies of Charity were among the other causes to which she gave of herself. Among other recognitions of her devoted service, Mary received the New York Archdiocesan Silve r Cross and Thanks Badge, the highest honor bestowed by the Girl Scouts of America. Mary was aunt to thirtynine nieces and nephews, and followed their lives and the lives of their children closely. Mary' s interest in others extended to families of her children's spouses, and friends of her family members. Numerous photographs of child ren adorned a large bulletin board next to her telephone. Birthdays, Easter, Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, wedding anniversaries, Mo ther's Day and Father's Day all saw scores of delivery vehicles acro ss the country deliver beautiful floral arrangements sent by Mary. While in her seventies, Mary lost her ''Book of Life'' in which she had collected names, addresses, birthdays, and anniversary dates. Sh e tirelessly reconstructed her book, concerned that she might miss an occasion to pass along her love and greetings. Other instances of her generosity, both to groups and individuals are too numerous to r ecount. Mary Fischer Bell was preceded in death by her husband, Ralph H.

If Congress wants to come up with funds for these areas, it will have to find the money by cutting even more elsewhere.",2001-05-10T05:00:00+0000

''There's not that perfect 'everything matching' look, which gives it more of a loft, home feel,'' said David Rockwell, the president of the Rockwell Group, which designed the 15-story, 77-room hotel (a new building, built from the ground up, a first for the firm) and Town restaurant downstairs. Entrance is by an imposing 12 1/2-foot-tall front door, right, carved out of American walnut in a weave pattern. Eclecticism rules in the 12th-floor duplex, which comes with a 400-square-foot terrace. The rug is Tibetan, the cherry oval table is English and the off-white sofa was designed by the Rockwell Group. To intensify the SoHo ambience, there are the ''exposed concrete ceilings, steel and glass, and art installations,'' said Ira Drukier, an owner of the Chambers, the Mercer and other hotels in New York City. Twelve artists created wall drawings, paintings and sculptures for the corridors on each of the 12 residential floors, including the exuberant design on the eighth floor by John Newsom, a Manhattan artist who painted a hummingbird soaring above fruit. ''I wanted to bring the American landscape indoors,'' he said. Guests will probably just ask for the floor with the Hawaiian-shirt-print walls. Rooms start at $425.

The chief executive, Michel Pebereau, said the outlook for the remainder of the year ''appears particularly difficult to predict.'' Socit Gnrale and Crdit Lyonnais, domestic rivals, said last week that first-quarter profit would drop significantly because of declining stock markets and the slowdown in the United States.

Hundreds of pregnant mares on horse farms throughout central Kentucky have been losing their foals due to a mysterious illness that scientists say might be a result of a fungus growing in the state's famous bluegrass. From April 28 to May 11, 386 stillborn or spontaneously aborted foals were brought to the University of Kentucky for examination. The horse breeding industry stands to lose tens of millions of dollars, perhaps hundreds of millions. Kentucky normally produces about 10,000 thoroughbred foals each year, accounting for one-third of the thoroughbreds born in the country. Edward Wong",2001-05-13T05:00:00+0000

After all, he was standing inside the very mountain that, according to Appalachian legend, had been blasted through with the help of John Henry, the fabled ''steel-driving man.''

What's the connection to the tale of the young girl from Moonstone, Colo., who became a great Wagnerian soprano? No prettified comparison of skylark to soprano, Cather sniffed: ''The title was meant to suggest a young girl's awakening to something beautiful.'' Cather used one art to help represent another. To see the William Blake exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- the books he wrote in his own hand and illustrated with his own engraving -- is to see the primal relation between word and image renewed.

us,Footnotes; What's Modern Now,"Just because you've bought a 1950's modern house doesn't mean you have to fill it with postwar classics. Although they're now regarded as giants of 20th-century design, Eames, Nelson, Bertoia and company were upstarts once. At this year's International Furniture Fair in Milan, there was some genuine innovation, employing new materials and technologies amid all the upholstered wannabes and colored-plastic fashion victims. For example: 1. The B.L.O. light took fairgoers' breaths away. Designed for Flos by Marcel Wanders, who seems destined to become design's poet laureate, it turns on or off with a single puff, via an electronic sensor. 2. The Bikini lounge chair, by Franco Bizzozzero for Bonacina Pierantonio, uses translucent plastic to give an old standby -- tube-wrapped outdoor furniture -- a glamorous makeover. 3. Carlotta de Bevilacqua's adjustable, polycarbonate Sui light for Artemide has an 18-L.E.D. light source instead of bulbs. 4. The Table That Eats Chairs, still in prototype form only for Cassina, is Ron Arad's latest mad-genius moment. What appear to be drawers under the plastic-topped table unfold into -- presto! -- molded-plastic chairs. 5. At Driade, Philippe Starck's Jelly Slice glass-topped table winningly combines whimsy and common sense; it becomes a bench when a polyurethane gel cushion is added. 6. Looking like an otherworldly gumdrop, Denis Santachiara's polyurethane-foam, Lycra-covered Marocchino pouf -- for Campeggi, a company known for its witty convertible furniture -- conceals a 24-watt light bulb. 7. Mario Bellini's Vol au Vent chair for B&B Italia is covered in a polyamide and stainless-steel fabric. 8. The Brazilian brothers Fernando and Humberto Campana's penchant for humble materials inspired their Papel cardboard sofa for Edra. 9. Carved wood is hardly revolutionary, but it sure looks modern in William Sawaya's Modovar chair for Sawaya & Moroni. 10. Mark McKenna and Jason Klimoski showed their lighted umbrella, Blame Sid, at Ingo Maurer. Tiny, rechargeable lithium batteries power the fluorescent tube. 11. Among Cappellini's many ahead-of-the-curve offerings was Fabio Novembre's Org Prototipo, a table with a glass top and 171 rope legs. (Don't worry: six of them are reinforced with metal.) 12. Illuminating Cappellini's exhibition was the Flying Light, a Starck design for Flos; it hovers gracefully in a helium-filled mylar balloon. Text by Pilar Viladas",2001-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Her Art Imitates Her Life. You Got That?,"''Why not? Why not? Why should my poems not imitate my life?'' Louise Glck writes passionately, almost maniacally, in THE SEVEN AGES (Ecco/ HarperCollins, $23), her ninth book of poems. In life, she continues, the ''lesson is not the apotheosis but the pattern.'' If ''The Seven Ages'' is any kind of proof, she's right. It's a book in which repetition functions as incantation, forming a hazy magic that's alternately frightening and beautiful. Whether Glck is talking about her relationship with her sister, a love affair or her own grappling with the passage of time, her insistence on getting at what lies beyond the physical world through seemingly ordinary details produces raw emotion covered with a deceptively simple sheen. Although these poems are autobiographical, there's not what we've come to think of as a confessional moment among them. ''We felt safe, / meaning we saw the world as dangerous,'' she writes of herself and her sister. ''We would prevail or conquer, meaning / we saw homage as love.'' Then, plunging to the center of the odd unconscious understanding that accompanies so much of childhood, she recalls: ''It was obvious to us two people couldn't / prevail at the same time. My sister / took my hand, reaching across the flowered cushions. / Neither of us could see, yet, / the cost of any of this. / But she was frightened, she trusted me.'' It's a moment of real heartbreak, the missteps of the future weighing down the memory of this small, hopeless survival tactic, and Glck handles it with the same delicacy that makes every poem in ''The Seven Ages'' a weighty, incandescent marvel.

Failure Forces Delay of McVeigh Execution,"The F.B.I.'s belated discovery of thousands of pages of witness interview reports related to the Oklahoma City federal building bombing forced Attorney General John Ashcroft to delay Wednesday's planned execution of the convicted bomber Timothy J. McVeigh until June 11. Mr. Ashcroft blamed the F.B.I. for its failure to turn over the reports to Mr. McVeigh's lawyers. The lapse is the latest embarrassment for the F.B.I., which earlier this month acknowledged that it failed to give secretly recorded audiotapes to Alabama officials in the early 1970's when the state reopened its investigation of 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church. The tapes proved crucial in the May 1 conviction of Thomas E. Blanton Jr., a former Klansman, for the crime. David Johnston",2001-05-13T05:00:00+0000

The 20-seat restaurant often swells with the residents of the John Witherspoon neighborhood, professors and ever-hungry undergraduates. Catfish, shipped from Mississippi, is cooked four ways: garden, baked, Cajun and Southern fried. The restaurant, a rare outpost of Southern cooking in New Jersey, has been a fixture on Leigh Street since 1988. Dinners (catfish $10.50, whiting $9.75, chicken $8.75, spare ribs $9.75) include two vegetables and a generous hunk of cornbread. The kitchen is a one-man, four-frying-pan show. The owner, George Cumberbatch, puts in 14-hour workdays, cooking up everything from a fish and grits breakfast ($6.50) to sweet potato pie ($2.50). Specials have included curry chicken ($8.75), Jamaican beef patties ($2) and cheese fries ($1.95). With help from his mother, sister and 18-year-old nephew, Mr. Cumberbatch also does some catering for Princeton University and for local church functions. He has lived on Leigh Street since moving from Barbados in 1973 and the restaurant is like an extension of his home. As for timing: closing time is a lost cause. The restaurant ''technically closes at 10,'' Mr. Cumberbatch says, but the screen door continues to creak open well past that hour. ''If need be, I'll go open up,'' he admits.

She was a vibrant and passionate woman who frequently devoted her efforts to political and educational campaigns. She loved sports and enjoyed competing and developing her skills. Bobbie was a student in Hanya Holm's first dance class in the United States, and was an early modern dance enthusiast thanks to her avant-garde mother. She danced and performed under the direction of Margaret Dobler at the University of Wisconsin. Bobbie was a fine student and graduated from UW in 1941. May 4th was her 61st wedding anniversary, an anniversary that marked so many years of a rare marriage. From that day in September 1938, when Bobbie and Bob met at the AEPhi Sorority tea, at the University of Wisconsin, it was a continuing love affair. They eloped to Dubuque, Iowa on May 4, 1940. As a new mother during World War II, Bobbie suffered the worry of separation from her husband. Shaped by her happy childhood in the Jewish community in Paterson, NJ, she maintained a lifelong bond to that place and those people. In Hillsdale, NJ, where Bobbie and her family resided for 45 years, she was active in many community activities including drama, fund-raising for many causes, and ardent support for the Bergen YJCC and Temple Emanuel. She regarded the growth and popularity of both these institutions as miraculous. Bobbie and Bob sponsored the immigration of the Raiskin family from Russia. She considered this to be a highlight of her life, & was immensely proud of this addition to her family. Bobbie leaves her husband, Bob, a daughter, Alison and a son, Roger, as well as a sister, Judith Weiner and her sister-in-law, Jane Kantor. She also leaves her three grandchildren, Kate, Daniel, and Sarah, and a host of loving nieces and nephews.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  SPENCE, HARTZELL","SPENCE-Hartzell. The writer and a founder of YANK the Army Weekly in World War II, died on May 9 at age 93, having made his home in Essex, CT since 1950. Best known for a novelized biography of his father titled One Foot in Heaven, Spence was the author of 15 published books and during his career wrote some 200 articles for such magazines as Saturday Evening Post, Look and Reader's Digest. Spence, born in Clarion, Iowa, Feb. 15, 1908 was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from the University of Iowa in 1930. He served the United Press Assoc. as Iowa bureau manager and then in New York as manager of the Special Service Bureau. In 1941, with the publication of One Foot in Heaven, a best seller, book club selection and motion picture, Spence became a freelance writer. In World War II he was assigned to the Army Special Services Div. to help develop the army weekly known as YANK. Ralph Stein's book The Pin-Up credits Spence with the first use of the term pin-up to describe pretty girl photos to adorn barracks walls. Spence's prospectus for YANK said that every issue should have a full-page ''pin-up'', and the term went into general usage. Later Spence was transferred to the Army Air Corps as special assistant to Gen. Lauris Norstad. For his service Spence received the Legion of Merit in 1945. Renewing his freelance career, Spence's books included two historical novels from the Spanish conquest of South America, Vain Shadow and Bride of the Conqueror, both book club selections, and Get Thee Behind Me, about his own Methodist parsonage upbringing. He wrote The Big Top with Fred Bradna, the renowned circus ringmaster and dramatized One Foot in Heaven for network radio. His three year series of Look Magazine articles studied the 16 largest American religious groups. These articles won 23 national awards and the series was published as a book under the title The Story of America's Religions. In 1964 Spence went to the Philippines and wrote a biography of Ferdinand E. Marcos, updated in 1969 under the title Marcos of The Philippines.

Although the company has committed $500 million to promote Xbox, the starting date gives Microsoft just a few weeks to build interest before the holiday shopping season begins. Robbie Bach, chief Xbox officer at Microsoft, said the company would have 600,000 to 800,000 consoles and 15 to 20 games available for sale. Sony, expected to be one of Xbox's major competitors, experienced embarrassing production shortages when it introduced its PlayStation 2 last fall.

Liberty HealthCare System, which owns the medical center, plans to build a 326-bed hospital on vacant ground just east of the existing Art Deco medical complex built in the 1930's. Jonathan M. Metsch, Liberty's president, said approval of the mortgage guarantee by the Federal Housing Administration made the project feasible by ensuring that Liberty can issue investment-grade construction bonds. He said Representative Robert Menendez was instrumental in securing the guarantee. Liberty had hoped to begin building the hospital, which has been in planning since 1983, in the mid-1990's, but its finances went ''into a tailspin,'' Dr. Metsch said, after a cut in Medicaid reimbursements. He said the medical center regained its financial health with a $3 million surplus in 1999, the year it applied for the mortgage. Steve Strunsky (NYT)",2001-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  BRODY, JEROME","BRODY-Jerome. Successful businessman, restaurateur, thoroughbred horse breeder & owner, political activist and devoted husband and father, died yesterday in Miami, Florida at the age of 78. Mr. Brody is perhaps best known for his successful restaurants, Gallagher's Steak House and the Grand Central Oyster Bar. However, he was equally successful as a breeder of thoroughbred race horses and champion Angus cattle. He was also very active in politics, supporting and working for John F. Kennedy, Edward I. Koch, and Mario M. Cuomo, among others. Mr. Brody developed Restaurant Associates from a loose string of coffee houses into a powerful and profitable business. He conceived and initiated the movement to create high quality destination restaurants in New York City, beginning with the development of the Four Seasons. With architect Philip Johnson, Brody also transformed the Rainbow Room, atop the then RCA Building, from a failing eatery into a world-class restaurant and night spot. One of Mr. Brody's greatest insights was the intersection between the public and private sectors. He turned Restaurant Associates around by recognizing the need for quality food service at public locations. He worked with the Port Authority and the New York Thruway Authority to meet their needs and requirments, providing a quality service to the traveling pubic and also making a profit. The Grand Central Oyster Bar became a success because Brody understood the limitations and opportunity of a premier but decaying public space. His revitalization of the restaurant helped improve the environment and safety of the station. His support of the renovation of the station enabled it to go forward and the restaurant provides an anchor to ensure the public expenditures will continue to be viewed as well spent. With his wife, the former Marlene HeiderGray, Jerome Brody built Gallagher Stud in Ghent, N.Y. into the leading thoroughbred breeding farm in the state. International Champion Allez Milord won graded stakes in Europe and the United States and was ultimately sold for stud duty in Japan. Among the many successful horses raced by Jerome and Marlene Brody, include Adorable Micol, Adcat and Adorydar. In public position in the thoroughbred racing industry, Brody strongly advocated for improved health and safety procedures for the horses, including technologically advanced emergency medical vans on the race track and state-of-the-art medical clinics on the race track, to treat injured horses. The son of a successful New York businessman, Jerome Brody was educated at Dartmouth College. He interrupted his studies to become a B-24 Air Corps pilot during WWII. Before his death, Mr. Brody arranged to sell both the Oyster Bar and Gallagher's restaurants to his employees at the two restaurants. He also arranged for equity interests for his senior managers at Gallagher's Stud in Ghent, N.Y. Brody also protected the future of the upstate farm throught the mechanism of a land trust. His wife Marlene, also his best friend, his sister Ellie, his children Kathy and Scott, and his grandchildren, Jill, Jason, Marisa, Leigh, David and Rick survive Mr. Brody.

The general consensus, though, is that Mark Green, the city's public advocate and the leader in early polls, scored a tactical coup in gaining the endorsement yesterday of former Mayor David Dinkins. Since Mr. Green was part of the Dinkins administration, the announcement was not a total surprise.

us,Metro Business Briefing," CAVEAT SMOKER, JURY FINDS A jury in New Brunswick, N.J., found yesterday that two tobacco companies held no liability for the lung cancer death of a Princeton lawyer, dismissing a claim that she had not been properly warned of smoking's risks. The verdict in the case, brought by the lawyer's husband against Philip Morris Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, extended the industry's winning streak in cases brought by individuals. The plaintiff, Myron A. Mehlman, contended that the cancer that killed his wife, Constance, was caused by the Marlboro and Camel cigarettes she smoked. Mrs. Mehlman died at 62. Her husband claimed that the companies failed to warn her about health risks, and that the cigarettes were defectively designed. The six- member jury rejected both claims. The cigarette makers contended that Mrs. Mehlman, who was a social worker and publisher before receiving her law degree in 1992, was well aware of the risks of smoking. The companies also maintained that her husband, a toxicologist, argued with her about her smoking. ",2001-05-17T05:00:00+0000

The plants are to have gas-turbine generators to avert possible power shortages. Opponents contend that the state skirted environmental laws to avoid a public review of the proposed plants and that it improperly placed them in poor neighborhoods. Trial courts in Brooklyn and Queens have issued conflicting rulings on the issues. On Wednesday, the Appellate Division in Brooklyn declined to stop construction pending its ultimate ruling on the challenges, and it set June 29 for arguments on them. An 11th site, in Staten Island, is not before the appellate court because the trial court in that case has not yet issued its final ruling, said Lisa Garcia, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, one of the groups seeking to block the plants.

It was less tied to rural tradition, more in tune with urban life. Jazzy towers of braids mimicked the first skyscrapers in Lagos. There were swirls and spikes, symmetry and asymmetry. Realizing that this evanescent art could vanish again, Ojeikere began documenting it. And last year, his portfolio -- J. D.

us,Things That Cannot Be Painted,"Imagine an erudite text about a single artwork that is as readable and riveting as a first-rate spy thriller. This rare mix is achieved by Michael Francis Gibson in THE MILL AND THE CROSS: Peter Bruegel's ''Way to Calvary'' (Acatos, $65). In lively prose unusual for such a scholarly work, Gibson discusses every factor that contributes to the grip of this complex painting, completed in 1564. He considers the roles of weather conditions and vegetation. He relates the movement of the windmill to astronomical events, so that we understand the ramifications of its astrological symbolism. He examines the characters of the crowd with a novelistic sense of detail -- the significance of clothing and possessions, the precise moment in each person's life -- and writes vividly of the nature of the brushstrokes, and the effects of scale, composition and color in Bruegel's work. Gibson informs us about Bruegel's political attitudes and personal life, while mercifully sparing us gratuitous data. He properly links the aesthetic impact and narrative function of essential elements of the painting, as in his description of the large rock in the background as ''dominating a devastated zone set between the luminous order of the town and the darker region of death'' and his trenchant analysis of this looming formation as representing ''the dominant power of the Law. . . . Frozen in mineral timelessness, it . . . embodies the archaic power that remains to be circumvented.'' In the tradition of fine-art historians like Erwin Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, Gibson, an independent scholar, successfully delves beneath the surface, while simultaneously honoring and exploring that lush surface in all its magnitude.

But at the other end is a 27-foot-high, 33-foot-wide grid of nine rooms that looks like a cross between a 1950's elementary school and the set of ''Hollywood Squares.'' In the space between the cottage and the grid, there is arranged the kind of elegant furniture that you find in a nice suburban house -- where the owners could avail themselves of the services of a very good decorator.

''Lining is perfect for a summery look that is economical,'' said Stan Fradin, president of Rockland Mills, a manufacturer of the fabric. Treated so it won't fade or discolor, it can be made water-repellent. Some weights will block light and provide some temperature control. Lining is as good for pinch-pleated draperies as for cafe curtains or flat panels.

With strength and courage he referred to the dates on her tombstone from the beginning to the end. He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the second with tears, but he said that what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent on earth and now only those whose loved her know what that little line is worth. For it matters not how much we own, the cars, the house, the cash. What matters is how we lived and loved when we're living out the dash. If we could just slow down enough to consider what is true and what is real and always try to understand the way other people feel and be less quick to anger and show appreciation more and love the people in our lives like we never loved before. If we treat each other with respect & often wear a smile, remember that the special dash will only last a while. So when your eulogy is being read, your life's actions to rehash, will you be pleased with what there is to say, about how you spent your dash? She was truly an AISHES CHAYIL (a woman of valor). A Jewish woman married to her beloved husband for over six decades, a caring and loving mother and grandmother. She exemplified to all what a true and loving person she was. Her star is not extinguished. Her star is just diminished. When her family and friends look up to the sky her light will shine down and continue to guide the family. She will be a liaison between HASHEM and her family & friends. She will speak on our behalf. Heartfelt condolences to the family.

Greatgrandson of the founder of the King Ranch and a San Antonio businessman, lost his hard-fought, courageous battle with cancer May 19, 2001, surrounded by his family. Johnson was well known throughout the country and abroad as a rancher, investor, philanthropist and scion of one of the largest ranching families in the world. He was born in Baltimore November 23, 1929, to Sarah Spohn Kleberg and Henry Belton Johnson, Jr. and was orphaned at an early age. He was raised on the ranch at Kingsville, Texas by his uncle & aunt, Robert J. and Helen Kleberg, Jr. Johnson was educated at Deerfield Academy, Cornell University and Stanford University School of Business. After service in Korea as a U.S. Army lieutenant, he returned to manage the King Ranch headquarters division. Johnson was as comfortable in the boardroom of corporate America as he was at home on the ranch. He was the senior director of AT&T for many years, and chaired the Public Policy committee. Other directorships included Tenneco, Campbell Soup, Signal Companies, United States Trust Co., Hamilton Brothers Oil Co., Texas Research & Technology Foundation, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, National Cowboy Hall of Fame & Western Heritage Center, and several Texas banks. Active in charitable causes, Johnson was a leader for years in the San Antonio United Way campaigns and served on the board of governors of United Way of America. He endowed a distinguished leadership lecture series at Virginia Military Institute in memory of his father, a 1926 graduate. Johnson purchased the Chaparrosa Ranch west of La Pryor, Texas in 1959, where he lived and raised his family. He made vast improvements on the Chaparrosa property including farming, feedlot, pasture and trophy hunting. Chaparrosa was also the home of the most prized Santa Gertrudis purebred cattle herds in the breed and, for 14 years, hosted the largest annual auction of Santa Gertrudis breeding stock. Johnson also served as president of Santa Gertrudis Breeders International during 1971-1973. In 1976, Johnson sold his interest in the King Ranch and established his own enterprise, Belton K. Johnson Interests. In addition to the Chaparrosa, he established Carmel Ranch Company in California, and acquired the historic Rancho La Puerta de Agua Dulce, and the Black Creek Ranch. Johnson's business ventures over the years included investments in oil, real estate, banking, plastics manufacturing, & a major video franchise. Two notable projects were San Antonio hotels: the Hyatt Regency, dedicated in 1981, and the Fairmount, which he had moved across town and restored in 1986. The most recent Johnson project was his biography authored by Martin Booth, entitled ''B.-The Life of Belton Kleberg Johnson''. Johnson was a member of the Bohemian Club, San Francisco; Clove Valley Rod & Gun Club, La Grangeville, NY; Club Giraud, San Antonio; Cypress Point Club, Pebble Beach, CA; Loch Lomond Golf Club, Scotland; Mark's Club, London; Metropolitan Club, New York; Plaza Club, San Antonio; San Antonio Country Club; The Argyle, San Antonio; The Order of the Alamo, San Antonio; and The American Club, Hong Kong. With his death, not only has everyone who knew him lost an admired and dear friend, but Texas is poorer for the passing of a rare spirit and a person who is (not was) in every sense a part of the state's history. It will not see the likes of him again. Johnson was preceded in death by his parents, his infant sister, Sarita, his brother, Robert Richard Shelton, his son, Belton K. Johnson, Jr., and his wife Lynne. He is survived by his loving wife, Laura McAllister Johnson of San Antonio; daughter-in-law Cecilia Johnson Hager of Kerrville and grandchildren Alice and Henry; daughter Sarah Johnson Pitt and husband Steve of Houston and grandchildren Sarita, Allegra and Stephen; daughter Cecilia Johnson McMurrey and husband, Mark, of San Antonio and grandchildren Harry, Belton and Estella.

COBRA, whose leaders include a former investment banker, Hansgeorg Hofmann, had been trying without success to orchestrate Commerzbank's sale to a larger bank. Martin Kohlhausen, who is retiring as Commerzbank's chief executive, fought off COBRA in part by issuing new shares to a friendly shareholder, Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. of Italy. Many analysts say that Commerzbank is too small to compete on its own and that the bank surprised shareholders earlier this month by reporting a big decline in first-quarter profits.

Nagle's has been some combination of pharmacy and ice cream parlor for over a century and now offers eggs, burgers, appetizers, sandwiches and salads as well as specialties like Nagel's egg cream ($1.50), cherry lime rickey ($1.50), malts ($3.75) and hand-drawn cherry Cokes ($1.75). The back of the menu is a reprint of special sales pharmacy (Kolynos toothpaste, normally 50 cents, only 34 cents; Hills Nose Drops, normally 35 cents, only a quarter; cigarettes at two packages for 25 cents), and there's an entire wall as an apothecary. For those who want to get an ice cream and stroll Ocean Grove, there is a sidewalk window. But customers frequently buy a cone and linger outside, where the names of all the pharmacists who ever worked there, along with their years of tenure, are listed on the front window.

But hope springs eternal. The happy news that films like Danis Tanovic's ''No Man's Land'' and Jacques Rivette's ''Va Savoir'' (''Who Knows?'') -- both shown in the festival's main competition -- were picked up in Cannes by American distributors encourages some cautious optimism about the prospects of Tsai Ming-Liang's ''What Time Is It There?'' and Manoel de Oliveira's ''Vou Para Casa'' (''I'm Going Home'').",2001-05-27T05:00:00+0000

As spring crops burst through the soil, it seemed clear that Mullah Muhammad Omar's ban on poppy production was a success. Afghanistan, recently responsible for 75 percent of the world's opium production, had eradicated the plant. But just as the Taliban were due for some good publicity, they demolished two priceless Buddhist statues and then, last week, ordered the nation's few Hindus to wear distinctive badges that reminded many international critics of the gold star imposed on Jews by the Nazis.

In the middle of their shy, almost wordless courtship, the teacher is called away to the city because of unspecified political trouble. The girl, played by Zhang Ziyi, has prepared him a breakfast of dumplings, and when he does not show up to eat them she chases after him, running across the hills clutching a covered porcelain bowl. Her beloved is a long way up the road, riding in the bed of a farmer's truck, and it appears objectively impossible that she will ever catch up with him.

In ''Passionada,'' which is now shooting, she's a tough-talking Portuguese biker chick. But on June 7, she will appear in a real-life spectacle -- her first high school prom. For the big event with a date who is graduating from the Collegiate School, Ms. Rossum covered all of this year's prom trends, including vintage looks and mixing silver with gold. ''I really wanted to wear couture,'' she said, ''but I knew I could only afford it by buying secondhand.'' At Michael's, a consignment shop on Madison Avenue, she found a short, flouncy Vicky Tiel dress for $544, with a nude lace bodice studded with rhinestones and seed pearls. ''You think you can see through it, but you can't,'' Ms. Rossum said. ''I call it Jennifer Lopez does 'Swan Lake.' '' To complete the prima doll erina look, Ms. Rossum chose a pair of Stuart Weitzman shoes of oyster silk and crystal ($205) and a matching evening bag ($225).

They do have one thing in common, though. Both are doing their best to stay out of prison. The Fist, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the gangster Vincent the Chin Gigante, right down to mumbling inanities and roaming the streets in his pajamas and bathrobe, chooses the insanity route to avoid the slammer, while Fausti goes so far as to change his name legally to Blanfort G. Melton and become a partner in a business offering Mob Star trading cards. Breslin wants to explain why the mob of Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky has fallen on such hard times lately -- most of its so-called leaders are languishing in jail -- and, for the most part, he's successful. But as a novel, ''I Don't Want to Go to Jail'' is flawed, often reading more like a series of colorful newspaper columns than a cohesive story. Still, Breslin's trademarks are all here: deft observations, sharp characterizations and wit. Charles Salzberg",2001-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Nancy Mah, who also designed the interiors of hangouts like Lotus and Sushi Samba, did away with the nostalgic Polynesian staples -- thatched huts, flamethrowing pu pu platters and red-eyed tribal totems -- and replaced them with pared-down references. There are abstract sunsets made of backlighted plexiglass, and plasma television screens play surf videos and have Internet access. The tropical cocktails have lost their dry ice mist and have been given names like the Honolulu Hangover and Hawaii 5-Ohhhh! Instead of servers in Don Ho attire, the waitresses wear midriff-baring Hawaiian-print halter tops. The massive Tiki head that traditionally lords it over the festivities is still there, but its forbidding features have been smoothed away, leaving an 18-foot-tall modernist sculpture with a V.I.P. seating area inside. ''We wanted to do something different,'' said Eddie Dean, co-owner of the lounge with Steve Steckel. Ms. Mah, snacking on jalape~no-glazed pork ribs in front of the sunset, said: ''Kitschy Tiki has been done so well for many years at places like Trader Vic's and the Tonga Room.

Bear in mind that ''older'' in this study meant not just Strom Thurmond or Rupert Murdoch old but also men in their late 40's -- a group we are pretty well accustomed to seeing as first-time fathers, especially given that many of us first-time mothers are kind of long in the tooth ourselves.",2001-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Fininvest owns a controlling 48 percent share of Italy's biggest commercial TV company, Mediaset, and holds part-ownership of Mediolanum, an insurance and financial services concern. The results were marred only by a 10 percent drop in income at Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's biggest magazine and book publisher, in which Fininvest owns a 48 percent stake.

us,National Briefing | Northwest: Washington: Power Rates Rise,"For the third time this year, Seattle's public utility has raised electric rates for its customers, citing the huge increases it is forced to pay as it buys power on the open market during a continuing drought in the region. Seattle City Light will charge its customers an average increase of 9.3 percent beginning in July, in addition to average increases of 10 percent imposed in January and 18 percent in March. The new increases will result in a monthly increase of $4.21, to about $57, for a typical family's electric bill. That bill is about $15 more than last year's average.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, did not admit involvement in terrorist crimes during a meeting in March with a German envoy. The cable, from the German Embassy in Washington, suggested that Mr. Qaddafi had admitted to the envoy that he played a role in the bombing of a discotheque in Berlin in 1986 and in the downing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The envoy, Michael Steiner, chief diplomatic aide to Chancellor Gerhard Schrder, has been under pressure to quit since publication of the cable this month embarrassed the government.
