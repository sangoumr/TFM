By George Steiner. 210 pp. New York: Atheneum. $7.95.If critics were to be turned into parlor games, George Steiner would be Monopoly. I don't intend this to be an unkind comment, because I enjoy the game. Unlike Steiner, how ever, I'm inclined neither to confuse a game with reality nor chess with Monopoly. When he asks what else exists in the world besides chess? he has already rather startlingly as sociated himself with Lenin, of all people, and dizzied himself with the possibility of 318,979,584,000 moves. Moreover, he has also connected chess with Nabokov's art, and sug gested an analogy between chess combinations and the disinterested combinatorial fertility of linguistic universals as described by Noam Chomsky and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Such an onthespot virtuoso accumu lation is Monopoly, in which symbols of property and construction fully engross winning players without real ly tying them down. The better and luckier the player, the more the rules seem to favor him. Steiner is a bill liant gamesman whose career and many rolls of the dice have finally won him control of the board, a posi tion he calls the language revolution.",1971-08-01T05:00:00+0000

John Love of Colorado officiated at the ceremony, which was attend ed by numismatists from many states. The remodeling of a huge room, once used only for storage purposes, included a new doorway leading to the street. The coinproducing plant, at West Colfax and Delaware Streetsso rich in early American historyis a major tourist attraction in Denver. According to Mrs. Brooks, between 3,000 and 4,000 per sons go through, the Mint daily during the spring and summer months, and a more convenient exit to the street was needed, she said. De lays in getting in and out of the plant have long been a complaint of visiting vaca tionists. The renovations were planned to expedite the tours. The small window counter in the lobby, where the miniature Presidential medals and Denver's own miniature medal, first struck in January of this year, had been sold, was found most inadequate. The irate phone calls from visitors complaining about wasting precious va cation time waiting in a long line to buy a medal con vinced me I had to expand the medal sales area, too, Mrs. Brooks stated. With space at a premium at the Denver Mint, it posed a prob lem finding a square foot not in use. Finally, however, we selected a room that could not accommodate production equipment and was used for storage. Visitors formerly got only a gallery view of the coin age manufacturing operations and perhaps a glimpse of the famous $1million display of gold bars. Now the new area makes it possible for us to exhibit some historic pieces of Mint equipment for our visitors to see at close range, the ener getic Mint Director pointed out. We also can offer for sale the national medals available in official locations (such as the Philadelphia Mint) in other parts of the country. The new displays include a coin press from 1873. This fascinating old press has been replaced by more modern equipment, but it was used as recently as 1968, after having been retrieved from the San Francisco Museum during the coin shortage of 1965the year mint identi fication marks were aban doned. The mint marks were restored in 1968. The old warlirse has the capacity to strike .240 cents a min ute, whereas its modern coun terpart produces 500 per minute.",1971-08-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: The Beatrice Lillie of 1930,"Although it was made in 1930, ""Are You There?,"" starring Beatrice Lillie and directed by Hamilton MacFadden, had its New York premiere yesterday as part of Miles Kreuger's retrospective of very early American musical movies at the Museum of Modern Art. Since the entire Beatrice Lillie filmography doesn't extend much over a half dozen movies, ""Are You There?"" automatically constitutes a raritythough one with a good many familiar elements.Shirley Travis, girl detective (Beatrice Lillie), is engaged by young Geoffrey (John Garrick) to unmask the guileful Countess Helenka (Olga Baclanova), who is plotting to marry his father, Duke of St. Pancras (George Grossmith).Disguised as Lady Diana Drummond, England's most valiant huntswoman, Miss Lillie charms the Duke, cuddles a fox, subdues the mighty Helenka, and during a gala spectacular staged in the courtyard of the ancestral castle (Miss Lillie and the chorus sing and dance a number called ""Bagdad Daddies"") captures an international gang of crooksthus saving the Duke's money so his son may inherit it.Although it would be a bad movie in any year, ""Are You There?,"" can only have improved with time. The tacky production pieces, the labored comedy routines, the generally helpless acting, even the California hills rising behind the portals of Castle Troongain from mellowness what they never have had in style.There is very little reason for seeing ""Are You There?"" except for Miss Lillie, but in seeing it, the changes of 40 years furnish a patina that in the popular arts inevitably encourages a kind of silly, forgiving nostalgia.Miss Lillie, of course, does have style, and a wit so specialized that her range and the range of the movie she is in scarcely ever meet with enough relevance to justify her being there. When she simply raises an eyebrow, she is often very funny, but ""Are You There?"" furnishes almost no situations to which a raised eyebrow would be appropriate. A good part of her time is wasted with a dreadful comedian named Lloyd Hamilton, feeding him material for slapstick clowning.But in her disguise as Lady Diana, Miss Lillie has at least one song suggestive of her talent (""Queen of the Hunt Am I""), and I suspect there could have been more. Before not releasing the movie, Fox cut out four musical numbers of which Mr. Krueger has obtained the titles. Among these, it might have been good to hear Beatrice Lillie sing something called ""The Iron in the Spinach.""",1971-08-02T05:00:00+0000

This has something to do with the usually loathsome consist ency of the outside air in much of the country, but the more compelling consideration may be the turnpike speeds at which cars commonly travel nowadays. At 70 miles an hour, a ride in an open convertible is some thing like flying in an opencockpit airplane.

us,Pacifist Strategy of 'Johnny Got His Gun',"""Johnny Got His Gun,"" which opened yesterday at the R.K.O. 59th Street Twin Cinemas, was written and directed by Dalton Trumbo, after Mr. Trumbo's own antiwar novel, originally published in September, 1939, almost on the eve of World War II. The story strongly reflects the emotional strategy of pacifist sentiment between the wars, and in the film makes some effort to re-create not only the intentions, but also the tone of that strategy.The hero of ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" whose name is Joe, is an American soldier who on the last day of World War I, has his arms, his legs and his face blown off by an artillery shell.Nevertheless, he survives, and, as a medical curiosity, he is kept alive beneath sheets and a gauze mask by doctors who believe that his brain is so damaged as to render him a living vegetable. They are wrong, however. Joe both feels and remembers, and his feelings and his memories are, in colored flashback and monochrome present action, the substance of the film.It should be obvious that, like its hero, ""Johnny Got His Gun"" is shrouded in virtue. But insistent virtue, without ideas, becomes demagoguery. ""Johnny Got His Gun"" has perhaps two ideas: one, that war is a crime, and two, that it is a crime committed by the old against the young. The first of these ideas seems unquestionable, but uninteresting. The second, though questionable, is also uninteresting. And yet they are virtually all the thought that gets into the film, the rest being a mess of clichd, imprecise sentimentalizing and fantasizing. On any terms that I might recognize and possibly credit, ""Johnny Got His Gun"" is a stultifyingly bad movie.Although Mr. Trumbo is primarily a screenwriter (""Hawaii,"" ""The Sandpiper,"" ""The Horseman,"" etc.), screenwriting is only the worst of the film's several failures. Each of the many reveries (Joe goes fishing with his father, Joe sleeps with his girl for the first time on the night before he leaves for war, etc.,) is directed for a kind of awkward open honesty that achieves only awkwardness instead. Although they are all wholly conventional in content and manner, they are all, in the ways they are photographed and staged, wholly grotesquelike the work of a Norman Rockwell who couldn't draw.The various nightmare fantasies, though as conventional (mostly neo-Fellini) are somewhat less grotesque, as if the director's imagination in aiming for the outlandish had fallen instead among the more comfortable old properties on a studio backlot. The hospital scenes, in setting very drab and rather formal, in the style of 1930's serious-movie interiors, are the most acceptableuntil they are ruined by Diane Varsi, a kindly nurse who finally gets through to Joe, in what may be one of the worst performances in the history of movies.Jason Robards plays Joe's father with the kind of awe at being just folks that he has long made familiar. Donald Sultherland plays Christ, a somewhat gratuitous role, with less awe but equal familiarity. The part of Joe is taken by Timothy Bottoms, a newcomer, and against all odds, he is very good. For reasons that I think have little to do with the writing or direction of his role, he brings a bit of real warmth and uncomplicated but cohesive humanity to ""Johnny Got His Gun.""",1971-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,A Shoot-'Em-Up 'Lawman' Bows,"Some cutting dialogue and boiling psychological tension are the most winning things about ""Lawman,"" a potent but curiously exasperating Western with those three hardies, Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan and Lee J. Cobb.This is the setup, familiar but perfectly viable. An iron-jawed realistic marshal, played by Lancaster, arrives in town to arrest an iron-jawed land baron and his henchmen for accidentally killing an old man. The crime, we repeat, was accidental and everybody knows it.Why, then, wouldn't this shrewd visitor ride straight to the ranch of his main quarry and confront this equally intelligent chap? This is Cobb. Instead, the intruder aggressively stalks around town, arousing the hatred of the good (and weak) citizens and the halfhearted support of a bright, weak sheriff, Ryan. Cobb's boys murderously go at the intruder one by one.There is, indeed, a baffling, oblique arrogance about the central character, played well by Lancaster, that belies his seeming quest for justice (""The law is the law""), the point of the film. But he is also a cold, egocentric fish. Wait till you see the final, main-street shoot-'em-up.While unresolved in substance, the picture is long on sting, as sharply directed by England's Michael Winner and cynically turned by the writer, Gerald Wilson. The acting is solid, straight down the line. Especially good are Robert Duvall, Albert Salmi and Sheree North, a lady who has never had her just acclaim.But it doesn't hold water, or convincing fire, for all the shooting.",1971-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Anyone who has stumbled through the Valley of the Dolls and even beyond, hoping for yet another camp masterpiece in the tradition of, say, ""Young-blood Hawke"" will know what I mean. And he may go right on stumbling.For although ""The Love Machine"" has enough dumb lines to qualify as a veritable anthology of unintentional humor, it hasn't the energy or the wit or, finally, the commitment to its own absurdities to provide the exhilarating sense of life that is the real appeal of the good-bad movie.I suspect that Samuel Taylor, in adapting the book, and Jack Haley Jr., in directing the film, knew pretty, well what they were about. But that knowledge seems all in the head, and not in the heart, where schlock belongs. And because everything is merely seen and not felt, certain key scenes, like the suicide of the beautiful model Amanda (in blurred close-up; the body across the bed, the empty vial, a few yellow pills beside the pink telephone, etc.), are never as funny as in more sensitive hands they might have been.Amanda kills herself because of a rotter named Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a TV newscaster who makes it big with his boss (Robert Ryan), his boss's wife (Dyan Cannon), several unnamed ladies of the night and his best friend (David Hemmings).He rises high in the network news, and even bids to take over the company, but loose habits and general rottenness eventually bring him lowwhich is where we leave him, walking off into the night, still spurning the help of Maggie, the girl who loves him and who figures heavily in the book but only gets into the movie enough to prepare for, perhaps, a Return of the Love Machine that may follow.A lot of good people are wasted in ""The Love Machine,"" and somewhere during Ryan's front-office pep talk to Law and Jackie Cooper, a nervous executive, about the importance of egghead prestige (""Look at those pictures on the wall. Picasso, Matisse  do you think those fellows played it safe?"") I began resenting the waste. Actors like Robert Ryan seem more and more like a precious national resource, and to say that Ryan escapes this movie with his soul intact (as he does) is to say too little.John Phillip Law generally adopts a posture of reserved displeasure, which may suggest his true feelings more than his character. The excellent David Hemmings plays a gay fashion photographer with some dignity but no enthusiasm, and only Jackie Cooper acts as if the movie actually mattereda position with which I don't agree, but for which I rather like him.A very lovely girl named Jodi Wexler plays Amanda, and though she is no actress, the rather intense nobility of her face is the one real memory the film offers.",1971-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Horror Film:'Brotherhood of Satan' Showing at Criterion,"Lovers of horror movies are doubly deceived. Already so lost in Plato's cave that our eyes can only recognize the shadows, we still seek an ideal that is no more than what our dreams project into the deeper darkness. Almost everybody I know has a perfect horror movie in mind, and, of course, nobody has ever seen it. Everybody has seen bits and pieces of it, however. And in ""The Brotherhood of Satan,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater, there are more bits and piecessometimes simply how long a shot is held, or the way the camera moves or doesn't moveto hoard against the rational daylight and the miseries of common sense.""The Brotherhood of Satan"" concerns a coven of ancient witches who take up residence in an isolated Southwestern town, where they proceed in a dreadful manner to gather the town's children of a certain age, whose bodies they plan to enter so as to ensure their immortality. They lack one to make the necessary 13, and it is for this reason that a young vacationing couple (Charles Bateman and Ahna Capri), whose daughter (Geri Reischl) has just had a birthday, find that they can drive into the town but that they cannot possibly leave.The witches procure their children by means of dolls and toys, not as enticements but as a way of murdering parentslike the toy tank that in the pre-credit sequence systematically demolishes a car and its occupants, leaving only a little boy, free now to join his already enchanted companions. In this sequence, and in a few others, the film displays bold, direct, relatively uncomplicated acceptance of its supernature that seems the essence of fantasy moviemaking and that extends to some wonderfully spooky scenesin a car, in a family living roomin which nothing quite happens and which are the most terrifying moments in ""The Brotherhood of Satan.""Compared with this, the actual brotherhood (and sisterhood) is a pretty dismal affaira kind of black-magic golden-age club to whom hooded figures serve cocktails before they settle down to their blood and witchcraft. Much of the latter involves parody religious ritual, along with a ritual cinematic bathos of hand-held camera, eerie closeups, etc., that only disrupts the mood at hand.A large part of ""The Brotherhood of Satan"" is set in the local sheriff's office, where the sheriff (L. Q. Jones), his deputy (Alvy Moore) and eventually the young couple lock themselves away from the terror stalking the town. These scenes are poorly acted and woodenly written, but they suggest a few ideas. I don't know what Bernard McEveety's ambitions as a director are. I don't think that he is about to bring the white magic of ""El Dorado"" or ""Rio Bravo"" into this genre. But around the little group of besieged good guys and the lighted office in the night, I begin to weave a fantasy and to dream of an ultimate Howard Hawks horror movie.",1971-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Reluctantly the wife takes him back, at first as a hired hand who works the land and sleeps in the barn. But in time their desires meet and he becomes a husband again. And it is then that he learns that Harris, his companion of the seven years, is held captive by a man he had wounded and is being slowly tortured to death. So Collings leaves his wife and farm and child and goes off to save his friend and to meet his fate.I don't know just what I expected of the Peter Fonda Western, but certainly not a film so sensitively appreciative of what might be possible in a Western as is ""The Hired Hand,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater. A certain amount of what might not be possible also gets in, for ""The Hired Hand"" is a rather ambitious simple movie, with a fairly elaborate technique and levels of meaning rising to the mystical, which seems so much a part of the very contemporary old West.But the technique, the lyrical lap dissolves and super-impositions, the straining to preserve images, the attempt to transform light into substance and symbolall belong to a mysticism that is not so much other-worldly as this-worldly, and which works to ameliorate the excesses and to forgive the pretensions of this lovely but by no means perfect movie. For ""The Hired Hand"" deals with spiritual imminence, and I think that its greatest ambition is to understand and, to a degree, to figure daily life in a state or grace.When Callings (Peter Fonda) gives up his wandering to return home, he rejects a role in an earthly Hell in order to earn a share in an earthly Paradise. Given its methods and its preoccupations, ""The Hired Hand"" is better with Paradise than with Hell, better with the solemnities of Verna Bloom's farm wife than with the ironic Christian symbolism of Severn Darden's evil outlaw McVey.For the outlands are full of signs and symbols and portends, but the farm is a place that is fully consonant with what it means  and there are no clues because all the mystery, though no less mysterious, has been rendered prefectly accessible. I find this notion exciting. And the images that are used to illustrate it  ordinary images of landscape, sky, house and people  I find absolutely ravishing.""The Hired Hand"" knows that its Paradise is both tenable and actual, but it also knows that nobody can stay there for very long, and that is why it accords so well with the gentle fatalism of the Western.Although it has some violence, ""The Hired Hand"" is best in its gentler moments and with its gentler performancesFonda himself, and especially Warren Oates as the friend he ransoms and who will carry on his life.But its greatest glory is in the passing of the natural day, the coming of the evening lightin all those commonplace gifts of awareness that could be merely decorative effect but that here seem visionary insight.""The Hired Hand"" was photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond with a perfect feeling for dramatic nature. Its music, which is simple, directly appealing, and very beautiful, was composed by Bruce Langhorne.",1971-08-12T05:00:00+0000

What arguments, what speculations. Can you imagine Joe behind that Giant line of the Sixties? He'd spend all day looking in clouds. What about Fran with the Jets? A winner, if they could move fast enough to keep him protected. The Super Bowl of 1969 and the GiantJet games tended to discourage the dilettantes, but the hard core compared on: Off the field, they noted, Tarkenton seemed most concerned with making money, Namath with making love. Tarkenton, a tidy, packaged man, seemed organized; he had a larger vision for himself and a scheme to fulfill Namath, big, wolfish, seemed to be loping stiffly in everwidening circles. Preachers found examples and anecdotes in Tarkenton's life and politicians courted him, both for his support and for his potential as a candidate. Broadway Joe's every success was a heartache to high school coaches and clergymen who ominously predicted a generation of harddrinking, everloving standup quarterbacks.

In 1976 he is apparently the sole normal survivor in the entire Los Angeles area following germ warfare ""between Russia and China."" Fortified in a penthouse perch and guarding a precious life-saving serum, he roams the city by day. At night, he battles a horde of bloodthirsty, half-human scavengers, got up in Spanish Inquisition robes, growling and waving torches. Wait till you see them.For about a half-hour, the picture coasts along uncertainly. The idea, derived from a Richard Matheson novel, is certainly sound. And Boris Sagal, the director, and his color photographer, Russell Metty  apparently working as a dawn patrol in Los Angeles  have impressively set the stage with some vivid, sweeping panoramas of a lifeless metropolis. Heston is an intelligent actor, but his flinty soliloquies pall, especially with those hooded zombies flapping around him. The film is best in its middle third, when Heston discovers and protects a group of young people in hiding, including a cheerfully cynical girl, played by Rosalind Cash, who perks up the whole thing. Peppered with some sharp, even amusing dialogue, the story temporarily shelves the heavy allegory and slips into good, slam-bang suspense.But it doesn't last. And the climax is as florid and phony as it can be, like a tired Western, with Dracula and company thundering after Hopalong Heston. They nail him down, quite literally, in an embarrassing fade-out carefully suggesting a crucifixion.If only the picture had sustained the brisk vigor introduced by Miss Cash, a doll with no nonsense about her.

The terminology king of allergies was appa rently coined by the author, Dan Carlinsky: it is not used in allergy circles. If there is any king of allergic dis eases, it is obviously asthma. Asthma affects 8,000,000 peo ple in the United States, about half of whom are children, It is generally accepted that up wards of 70 per cent of asth ma is allergic in nature. Asth ma is a lifethreatening dis ease and causes approximately 5,000 deaths a year. Most al lergists will agree, however, that untreated hay fever may lead to asthma problems later in life. We also regret the im pression that the only thing one can do about hay fever is to leave the home area, For many years allergists have been successfully desensitiz ing many patients to the point where they can live comfort ably and normally during the season. And, it should be pointed out, the ragweed sea son of Aug. 15 to the first frost applies principally to the Northeast, or east of the MisUnless definitive diagnostic tests are made by a compe tent physician, preferably an allergist, to determine the particular plant pollen or mold spores causing the reaction, one can go into areas free of ragweed pollen only to dis cover that it is something else, or something in addition to ragweed, that is causing the problem. Mr. Carlinsky did not indicate the wide vari ety of trees, plants and grass es that cause allergic prob lems. Also omitted from the article was the basic fact that allergy is a disturbance of the body's defense mechanism known as the immune system. This means that the allergic individual can become sensi tized to many other environ mental substances affecting various organs. Treatment gives protection.",1971-08-15T05:00:00+0000

This is pretty nonsense. The name rosemary is an English corruption of the Latin ros marinus, meaning marine dew. In any case, sprigs of the plant add a heady, pungent odor to all manner of food. In this stew from Italy, it is combined with several other herbs traditional Mediterranean countries.

Second, and perhaps more important, the reason people camp has changed. No longer do people walk in the evening moonlight; in stead, they retire into their trailers to watch TV or play cards. Some, as stated in the parks article, lie in the fields having parties, getting artifi cial highs and leaving gar bage. They are certainly not there to rough it. Two years ago at Mount Rainier, there was only one tent besides ours. The other campers came in their trailers, not looking for America's beauty but for a cheap vacation with the kids.

A great deal of patient analysis has still to be carried out. This is where Richard Grunberger's book is so valuable. He has pro duced in it a social autopsy of the Nazi era, obviously incomplete but with a wealth of documentation and detail.

Since I travel with only one, large suitcase, everything was lost; and when all of one's traveling valuables are in one container, the total value is obviously quite high. The items in my bag included a camera, strobe light, binoc ulars, flycasting equipment and electric razor, as well as much clothing. I calculated the value at over $1,200. After having to waste time shop ping for basic articles of clothing while on vacation, soon learned that no one is legally responsible for the major part of the loss in curred. The airline representa tive merely pointed to the fine print on the plane ticket and offered the maximum settlement of approximately $330. One only becomes aware of this sort of discrepancy when one's suitcase is lost: otherwise the fine print is there to be ignored.

us,Screen: Karen Sperling's 'Make a Face' Arrives,"""And living hereis that to conceal the fact that you're a wealthy young lady?"" The answer is no. And since ""here"" happens to be a respectable number of high-ceilinged rooms in one of those Central Park West tenements in the 70's (the Dakota, in point of fact), one might wonder why the question was ever asked. However, he who asks is a Daddy-appointed psychiatrist, and one must expect the least. And she who answers is a solitary young woman, almost a recluse in her splendid apartment, alone with her dog, her art, her radio, her television and her many imagined or perhaps real terrors. She has more important things than her wealth to conceal. And it turns out that she owns the dear old building anyway.Her name is Nina. She is played by Karen Sperling, who also produced, and for the most part wrote and directed, ""Make a Face,"" which opened yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema. Although it is pretty much a one-woman movie (excepting bit parts for the psychiatrist, a young friend, a few hallucinations and telephone voices ranging from grandma to a whispering assassin), ""Make a Face"" is by no means a one-character movie, since Nina splits into three and possibly four personalities  perhaps including the one that unaccountably changes the window shades, orders the $47 worth of Chinese food she doesn't want and dismantles her apartment when she's out.""Make a Face"" deals in images at several levels of awareness, sometimes consecutively  as when it cuts between Nina talking and Nina appearing in the mirror-fragment constructions that are her art work and are the film's most straightforward and, curiously, most evocative sign of its intention  and sometimes simultaneously, as when it has Nina on television discussing her work, while behind her a dimmer and larger TV transmission of a nude Nina makes love, and then the camera backs up to reveal that the television screen is itself a television picture, and so on, as if projected into a series of repeating mirrors.Many of Nina's fantasies are sexual, and many of them involve a dark, menacing leather-jacketed young man who keeps appearing in the elevator and outside her door and in her hallwayonly to disappear when she tries to show him to anyone else. He may be hallucination, or he may be the roommate of the transvestite downstairs, who may also be hallucination, and he may be real. In any case, he is a figure of terror, but he is not entirely unwelcome.What Nina lets into her world is a kind of sound-and-light show, pictures and broadcasts, dealing with the current state of the planet's public misery. But what gets into her world, without invitation, is a more subtle blend of expectation and anxiety, provocation and intimidation. It is on this level that ""Make a Face"" comes closest to making a movie.By no means a dishonorable or uninteresting project, ""Make a Face"" seems to lack the spirit of its ambitionsthough it clearly has the will, and the intelligence, and almost too much of the technical apparatus. Miss Sperling herself, a very handsome, reserved girl, is not enough of an actress to make her situation as exciting or even as disturbing as it is meant to be. Since she is never absent from the film, by voice or image or both, it is finally the wrong sort of strain to have to wonder not what she is feeling, but whether she is feeling anything at all.There is in ""Make a Face"" the seed of a mystery story that might be more terrifying and more fun than the mystery of personality that is actually its central subject. For the evil genius in Nina's world is her father, a disembodied telephone voice, who would love to control the property she has inherited and who might not be above producing Nina's nightmares for his own benefit.In this regard Miss Sperling's work at least recalls the cinema of Fritz Lang, especially the magnificent, trashy Mabuse films with their bogus supernature, their psychological traps, their claustrophobia and voyeurism developed in a vocabulary of images very like Miss Sperling's.She is not really making that kind of movie yet, and I don't know whether she wants to. But I think she has the imagination for it, and I hope that she will try again and succeed.",1971-08-16T05:00:00+0000

Even with his sword in the repair shop and only a walking stick to hand, he overcomes at odds of 4 to 1, and no contest. But using his sword in the grand finale, he had bettered 40 to 1 before I lost count, and his enemies lost heart, and the movie ended with Ichi trudging off alone into the rising sun. He had just finished freeing an amiable countryside from a harsh overlord, winning a lot of money through his uncanny skill at listening to the cast of loaded dice, giving several successful massages, slurping a lot of noodles and winning the heart of the girl of his dreams (Shiho Fujimura)  whom he has the good sense to leave behind to the kind attentions of the innkeeper's handsome son.Almost all the major action is formula, of a not disreputable sort, with individuation prety much reserved for the quirks of the hero's character. It is a rather nice character, as played by Shintaro Katsu, but it is not up to living down the formulathe off-hand slaughter and, above all, the heroic idiocies of the grand climax in which slain samurai fall like candy wrappers into the popcorn snow of the wind-blown studio streets.Where it is quiet enough to allow Ichi his peaceful idiocyncrasies, ""Zato Ichi's Cane Sword"" is a pleasantly modest film, an amiable contrast to the fateful solemnities of the Toshiro Mifune samurai dramas. Ichi's very invulnerability makes for a certain relaxation, a few songs, a little buffoonery, and much of it to the good.""Zato Ichi's Cane Sword"" was directed by Kimiyoshi Yasuda and photographed in not-quite color by Senkichiro Takeida.",1971-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Made in New York, under the direction of John G. Avildsen (of ""Joe""), it has a group of grubby characters pawing and mauling one another in the wake of a bumbling gumshoe slob, played by Allen Garfield, who looks like Edgar Kennedy, the old-time comic.Sheer brazenness, not to be confused with merit or art, is its trademark, as the film piles on layer upon layer of clichs about sex and more sex, with banal whodunit trimmings.The picture comes on like a fire engine, sparing nothing, and this viewer shook with laughter for a goodor shocked  10 minutes. Some of the dialogue, slamming away at everything from television vigils to police procedure, prostitution and dope addiction, lands on target hilariously. The language is Anglo-Saxon, veering toward latter-day English. And the cast, headed by Mr. Garfield and Madeleine le Roux (fresh from ""The Dirtiest Show in Town""), gave it their all and we're not kidding.Actually, there's a good whodunit plot, from a Michael Brett novel, beneath all the commotion. But while the steam seldom runs out, the gas does. The pace lags. It adds up to a dirty joke, often sharp, but dirty. It's too much and not enough. Both.",1971-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,An Enigmatic 'Doc',"""Doc"" misfires. Too bad. this picture is loaded with talent and potential.It is one thing for a Western to frankly set about debunking two legendary stalwarts such as John (Doc) Holliday and Wyatt Earp, with their iron-jawed heroics from other films and television. Teasingly, studiedly and bafflingly, ""Doc"" serves up a pair of eccentric gunsharps seemingly more interested in each other than in law and order. Well, who knows?But the climax, when these two bland egotists serenely slaughter a clan of seven, who are apparently ready to ""talk,"" is a pious, gory jolt that yanks the rug from under the whole picture. What realistic history book yielded this incident?Around these two focal enigmas, and their workmanlike facade portrayals by Stacy Keach and Harris Yulin, there uncoils an arresting eyeful, populated with mean scroungy Western characters and simmering with promise. The barbed, grisly dialogue comes from Pete Hamill, the columnist, in a screen original. And under the director-producer, Frank Perry, a snakelike, rhythmical tempo builds a cutting tension.In contrast to the fogbound Doc and Wyatt, two other characters are crystal clear and beautifully played by Faye Dunaway, as the mire-spattered Katie Elder, and Denver John Collins, as a young, budding marksman. But the real star of ""Doc"" is a transplanted Tombstone, Arizona, stunningly evoked in Spain by Gene Callahan, the production designer, and Gerald Hirschfeld, the color photographer.""Doc"" loses out.

us,Rousing 'Soul to Soul',"""Soul to Soul"" will hook you. We defy anybody to watch the final half hour of this color documentary of a soul and gospel music concert, performed in Ghana, without tapping a foot. But it is the sea of rapturous black faces, those of the visiting American artists and their Ghana audiences, that makes this movie a haunting experience.Most fortunately, Denis Sanders, who did so well with his documentary on Elvis Presley at Las Vegas, was recruited to direct this project. The occasion is an American program given last March in a huge open-air theater in Ghana's capital city, Accra, to cap the African nation's 14th Independence Day festivities. Neither Mr. Sanders, the group of visitors nor the movie wastes much time with the travelogue frills and detours.We meet the group of musicians briefly in flight, see them given an airport welcome and watch them take a few excursions. And the warm, frank curiosity of the more sophisticated Americans as they are entertained by the primitive dancers and singers is fascinating to behold and typical of what follows. There is one poignant rendition of the song ""Free"" as two of the visitors explore an old slave fortress on the African coast.Mainly and compactly, the film sticks to the concert, brilliantly evoking the performances and crowd reactions in a flow of closeups and panoramic shots, to the stabbing, pounding pulse of the music. It would be hard to imagine better good-will ambassadors from this country to anywhere than Santana, Willie Bobo, Roberta Flack, Les McCann, Eddie Harris, the Staple Singers, the Voices of East Harlem, the Damas Choir, Amoa Azangio and the Kumasi drummers.But the highlights of the program and the real thrill of the film are the peerless Wilson Pickett, a performer with strong impact, and Ike and Tina Turner, the latter rendering one blues number, ""You Are Gone,"" the likes of which we have never heard before. And has anybody ever commented on this woman's beautiful smile? In ""Soul to Soul,"" black isn't merely beautiful. It's unsurpassable.",1971-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Full-Time Voyeur:Benjamin Cast in Lead of 'Young Stockbroker',"The latest, and surely the least, of those movies that mean to tell us how we now live, Lawrence Turman's ""The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker,"" opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater. Although its title and the casting of its leading actor and certain elements of its plot may give the impression of something manufactured out of several other films' patched cloth, ""Stockbroker"" is generally its own different kinds of movie, most of them bad.A young Los Angeles stockbroker (Richard Benjamin), finding himself without accounts and noticing that the broker in the next cubicle has just dropped dead on the job, decides to quit work and give himself up to his hobby: voyeurism. All goes well and routinely enough until one night at the beach his wife (Joanna Shimkus) tires of waiting after he has climbed out the bathroom window to observe the local talent, and the next day she leaves him. For the balance of the movieabout an hourit is touch and go as to whether this marriage can be saved, whether he will reform, whether she will succumb to the melodramatics of her sister (Elizabeth Ashley) or the malpractice of the family marriage counselor (Patricia Barry).I can well imagine a comedy about voyeurism. Most movie critics live one. But ""The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker"" isn't really about voyeurism, any more than it is about stockbrokering. It does have a bit to do with marriage, but mostly in terms of mechanics  sexual mechanics, the mechanics of marital supremacy, the nuclear family as a machine for getting on in the suburbs. In this connection, its only real subject is its own comic situations, and its real genre is the unsuccessful television pilota type to which a good many recent American movies belong.Richard Benjamin plays the stockbroker in much the same way that last year he played the husband of the mad housewife, a characterization that does not build great sympathy. He is a good comedian, but miscast and, I think, badly miscalculated in his portrayal of the secret life of vicarious passions. It is difficult to say what Joanna Shimkus portrays, except distaste, and only Elizabeth Ashley has command of a role, half timid tease, half domineering housewife, conventional to be sure, that seems to belong to the two-thirds of the movie in which she appears.At one point the stockbroker runs into a girl, a stranger, who invites him to act out his fantasies, which, with considerable unfunny maladroitness, he does. The sequence is a loss, but the girl, a stern and unusual beauty named Tiffany Bolling, isn't.",1971-08-20T05:00:00+0000

Christa also yearns for a Prince Charming. She finds him, whereupon the nasty man from the past pops up menacingly.Will Christa find true happiness? Does a dog have fleas?This is a Danish-made film, by no means a steaming sex pastry, and a determinedly Civilized and confident tribute to that country as an unfettered sexual Utopia. What squashes it into neutrality is that soap-opera plot, with a convenient, melodramatic wind-up.Now it's one thing for an attractive girl to bed down serenely with a succession of new men, hoping for Mr. Right. It could happen here.Denmark, the film keeps insisting, approves emphatically. To emphasize this, the footage drifts off into striking but random travelogue footage of Copenhagen and its vicinity, replete with smiling faces and picturesque architecture. Photographed in color, it all looks perfectly beautiful, including one briskly casual peek inside a pornography book store.In any case, and certainly in hers, Christa, played by a delectable gal named Birte Tove, doesn't waste time. ""The human spirit is at its best with all masks off,"" she tells an Italian lover, whose pop-eyed ""Mama mia!"" at some nude bathers is plain funny. The nudity, by the way, while pointed, is discreet.Unfortunately, the predictable plot is coated over by Jack O'Connell, who made the movie, with some extremely gauzy, mystical-sounding dialogue. The acting is quite good, especially by Daniel Gelin as a music conductor who sadly leaves Miss Tove (""Music cawms first"").Good, too, is Clifton Greyn as the stalwart Australian standing by through Christa's final crisis, when a jarring rock 'n' roll score slips into sweet violins. The dialogue, incidentally, is both subtitled and spoken English.Let's face it. Copenhagen or Oshkosh, a girl who stacks five swains (all we see here) is bound to hit one dud.",1971-08-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"Devotees of Ivy ComptonBurnett (they must be numerous enough to form a society) are familiar by now with the standard publicity handout that shows the novelist as every inch the dour Victorian schoolmarm. Looks were never more deceiving. Dame Ivy, who, died two years ago at the age of 85, after finishing her 20th novel, is, in fact, a revolutionary figure in modern literature. With a magic all her own, for the last half century, she has broken through the conventions of fiction to turn the English comedy of manners into a stunning parody of itself. I find it curious that the subversive element of her vision what one might call her antiEstab lishmentism  has so far escaped her English critics, who tend to regard her as only a slightly more waspish Austenesque interpreter of the human comedy. Like Jane Austen's, of course, her series of novels (set in Edwardian England at the beginning of the century) has unity of time and place, and like hers it deals with the landed gentry. But a dissimilarity of intent suggests itself to me in the modern novelist's disregard for texture in contrast to Miss Austen's carefully wrought regionalism. Dame Ivy's novels are, in fact, descriptively bare: Like the abstractionist painter, she depends on the telling stroke (one dares not skip a word in her slim novels). Her major innovationnarration through conversationleaves the author no opportunity to comment directly on the action, to moralize. Static figures in a landscape, her characters are revealed by what they say, not what they do or think.",1971-08-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Coutard Focuses on Vietnam in 'Hoa-Binh':Rhetoric of War Fades in Face of Reality Boy Left to Find Way in a Scarred World,"Among cinematographers younger than 50 there is probably none more internationally famous or more justly famous than Raoul Coutard, who has photographed most of the greatest films of Franois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. So highly is Coutard regarded that some critics unfriendly to the French New Wave have speculated that the real genius behind films like ""Une Femme Est une Femme"" and ""La Chinoise"" was the photographer and not the director at all. For this line of reasoning to be laid to rest, I suppose it would be necessary for Coutard to make his own movie, and this he has now done. It is called ""Hoa-Binh,"" and it opened yesterday at the Lincoln Art Theater.In many respects it is very much a photographer's movie. Looking not at all like Truffaut or Godard, it is full of muted colors, striking images that seem to have been included for their own sake, and details held in splendid isolation  as the camera rather than the eye might see them. All of which gives ""Hoa-Binh"" a curiously old-fashioned and rather artlessly handsome look not entirely inconsistent with the moods of its storywhich is, however, set in the midst of the modern and unlovely reality of contemporary South Vietnam.Although it was made under the shadow of, and is necessarily about, the war in Vietnam, ""Hoa-Binh"" goes to almost excruciating lengths to avoid propagandistic persuasion. And although its locations are actual and its actors mostly amateur, it has a story, and its reality is the reality of fiction and not of documentary.The hero is named Hung, an 11-year-old boy whose father goes off to join the Vietcong and whose mother shortly afterward is hospitalized with terminal cancer. The sole protector of his baby sister, Hung soon leaves the unfriendly cousin with whom he has been placed and begins to make his way in the young-people's free-enterprise world of Saigon. He tries his hand at stevedoring and gambling, at which he does well; and at shoe-shining and newspaper-selling, at which he does badly.In general, the children's fortunes decline, but in the knick of time a nurse, a total stranger, takes them in, gives Hung shelter, gets him a job, and places the baby in a nursery. Meanwhile from the North, Hung's father begins a journey home, to deliver messages and to begin again with what is left of his family.I'm not sure that any movie based on a fiction so limited and, in a sense, so gratuitous, could be wholly satisfactory. ""Hoa-Binh"" adds to its simplicities a kind of hapless awkwardness in execution, in the mechanics of simply carrying a scene through. And at the same time it introduces ideological materiala humane justification of the American presence overheard from an Army sergeant while Hung shines his shoes; an organizer's lucid promise of Vietcong victory while United States jets roar overheadthat it is not really prepared to digest except in terms of obvious ironic illustration of the futility of high thought in a world of low feeling and of intensely personal privations.But ""Hoa-Binh"" ultimately succeeds beneath the play of ideology, and despite its structural crudities, and even despite the indulgences that Coutard sometimes allows his camera. For it is a deeply honorable work, as honorable in its refusal to place blame as in its decency in the face of human suffering. In this it achieves a moral reticence that approaches asceticism and that is as beautiful to watch in the movies as anywhere else.You can see it most clearly perhaps in the lovely performances of Phi Lan as Hung and Xuan Ha as his young mother. If you watch their eyes you will see that their looks and glances, wonderful in themselves, are used not to externalize suffering and so engage the audience's sympathy, but to communicate and so build a world of shared understandingeven though that understanding may include not only love but also fear and hate.The result is a self-sufficiency that begs no responses, but that is moving in some of the ways that film can be movingwithout at the same time losing its bearings and pretending that it is life. Anyone can imagine a dozen movies about Vietnam, full of searing indictments and heartbreaking revelations. But ""Hoa-Binh"" is none of these. With all its faults it is something very much better, more complete, more secret, more genuinely in touch with the mysteries of human perception.",1971-08-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Douglas and Cash Star in 'A Gunfight' With Apache Backing,"""A Gunfight"" was financed by the Jicarilla Apache Tribe. This, so far as I know, is the first time that a movie has been backed by Indians. The Jicarillas are now, as investors, in a class with Quaker Oats and Bristol-Myers, who are also making movies. Not surprisingly, these Apaches have made a Western, but a Western without Indians. It's the cowboys against the cowboys with no commercial message from the sponsor.The distributor, Paramount, by dropping the picture quietly into neighborhood theaters is obviously making a judgment about the movie's box-office potential. Enter the reviewer, hopeful to prove that the studio is myopic, the Indians are sage and the movie is a sleeper  like ""Lonely Are the Brave,"" ""Will Penny,"" ""Ride the High Country,"" ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue.""""A Gunfight"" reminded me just a little of ""Ride the High Country."" Like that Sam Peckinpah classic, Lamont Johnson's movie concerns two retired cowboys, compelled to return to action for one last time. Here the two are antagonists, ex-gunfighters, Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash.Douglas is Will Tenneray, once infamous in Dodge City, but now settled into a boring respectability. He is paid to stand at a bar and ""sucker fools to buy drinks."" Cash is Abe Cross, a successful killer turned into a failed prospector. He is a loner, riding into the movie to the tune of an off-camera Johnny Cash title song (""It's an evil wind that blows . . .""). Everyone expects them to blow each other's brains out, and betting begins even before Douglas's son (his son, Eric) first cries, ""Paw, Abe Cross is in town!""Although Douglas and Cash have never met, they know each other's inflated reputation. They have much in common, but of course they decide to duel  for the moneyand to justify the title of the picture. Survivor takes all, and as the advertisements say, spoiling the surprise ending, ""Widow takes the body.""Much is made out of the humor of the situation (although this is not really a comedy). These are two old teases  demanding money from a big-city reporter to let him take their picture pointing guns at each other. ""Ain't this familiar?"" jokes Cash.It is mostly the stars' presence that gives the movie authenticity  Douglas with his aging chin-dimple more and more resembling a bullet wound; Cash, his face corrugated, his voice rumbling and gravelly. They are a natural match: Douglas's grin hiding despair, Cash's frown concealing an inward ease.Their acting manages to be both laconic and forceful even as the movie grooves into clich. ""You want to be Tenneray again,"" Douglas's wife explains his new will to kill. The direction becomes flaccidblurred foregrounds and smudged focus. The symbolism is stock. The gunfight will take place in a bullring, in itself a too-obvious notion made worse by earlier use of bullfight music as a pace-heightening device. Laurence Rosenthal has composed a symphonic score that is jarring to the simplicity of the moodlike playing the ""Grand Canyon"" Suite before an Edward Hooper landscape. Cash's tune would have been much more compatible as a running theme.Mostly what is missing is any detailing of the bond between fighters. Douglas tells his wife (an excellent performance by Jane Alexander) that if he kills Cash he will lose his last friend, but there is little to prove the statement. One is reminded again of ""Ride the High Country.""

us,Woody Strode Brings Rich Talents to a Limp 'Black Jesus',"Woody Strode? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. ""Black Jesus?"" No.It was a thrill yesterday to see the name of this exceptionally fine Negro actor elevated to solo star billing, after propping up many a film for years. Sadly, neither this Italian-made picture nor the role itself, primarily a matter of saintly symbolism, are up to him.Mr. Strode, with his keen, lidded eyes and strong, gaunt face, does a perfectly respectable job of portraying an imprisoned, tortured and executed visionary leader in an African country. His gentle spirit of nonviolence and agonized endurance under pressure are painfully real. The rest is not.The film is a shadow play, hardly a movie at all. Except for the opening and finale, it is glued to the inside of a prison, where the camera carefully measures every footstep and monosyllabic utterance. The picture is stark, studied and slow as a snail.This would be O.K. if we simply knew more about the characters. Who exactly are the brutal whites running the prison? The implication is that they are Belgian, although the commandant, played by Jean Servais, happens to be Dutch. Mr. Servais is excellent in the only entirely lucid characterization in the film.The third key role, apparently meant as a latter-day Barabbas, is that of a babbling, half-mad thief in the prison cell, played by Franco Citti.For that matter, how did Mr. Strode's martyr arise to leadership? And what is the real nub of the political conflict? The direction of Valerio Zurlini is so deliberately careful and overly detailed, much of it meaningless, that the film gets downright tedious. Finally, with the mixture of English and dubbed English, the dialogue has a curious, singsong quality.The face of Mr. Strode is memorable. It's not enough.",1971-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Medicine Ball Caravan' Bows:Free-Wheeling Bus Is Followed Across U.S.,"""Medicine Ball Caravan,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza, is the filmed account of a free-spirited bus trip made last summer by 150-odd beautiful people, counter-culturists, musicians, Hog Farmers, hangers-on and hip entrepreneurs. Also along, not exactly for the ride, were assorted journalists, Franois Reichenbach, a French director, with (according to the Warner Brothers publicity sheet) a ""crack 15-man film crew,"" and two studio accountants. For this last information I am indebted not to Warner Brothers but to Ron Rosenbaum, a Village Voice reporter, whose eyewitness articles on the caravan make an essential accompaniment to the movie.Led, more or less, by an immense, bearded, deep-voiced, aging disk jockey named Tom Donahue, the caravan set out from San Francisco in silver-painted buses carrying tie-dyed tepees, headed for points east (and eventually, the Isle of Wight) with the intention of giving concerts, confronting middle America, and incidentally making a movie. The movie begins in San Francisco, as, on the sound track, a choir of heavenly voices sings over the head of Tom Donahue in his broadcasting studio. But it ends, a little abruptly, at Antioch College in Ohio, where there was a confrontation, but not the one that had been expected.The ostensible reason for the caravan was, of course, to present concerts. What you see of the concerts seems to have little enough to do with the caravan. For the most part they feature imported big-name talent, B. B. King, Doug Kershaw, etc., and they are treated by Reichenbach as isolated, self-contained events. On the other hand, there are the caravan's ""events"": bathing in a giant bowl of Jello prepared by Wavey Gravey and the Hog Farm, pacifying the violent STP Family in Boulder, answering the activists at Antioch.The caravan's real problems came not from middle America, which, according to the evidence on the screen, seemed downright chummy, but from the youthful political left, which, despite a certain amount of camouflage, saw Warner Brothers and smelled a rat. Along the way an activist named David Peel attached himself to the caravan with the purpose of exposing it, and at Antioch there occurred a series of misadventures leading to spur-of-the-moment guerrilla theater, a nontheatrical knife attack on Peel and much violent argument over the not so profitable question of who was bought and who had sold; between the movie company and the counter culture, who was ripping off whom.In a case like this I would normally side against the movie company. The staged documentary is not on the whole an interesting form. But the concluding confrontations very nearly changed my mind, and after 30 seconds of listening to the ravings of an Antioch activist I was almost ready to love Warner Brothers.Movies like ""Medicine Ball Caravan"" tend to run to cinematic effect; and for Reichenbach this means heavy reliance on telephoto lens, split screen and a kind of Rorschach-blot doubling of images during the concertsso that B. B. King's profile duplicates itself and the materialized vibrations of the Cajun Fiddler's fiddle run out of the frame like railroad tracks. None of this is dreadful, but much of it has been seen before, and, like the film's many impromptu interviews with its own people, adds up to no experience.",1971-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,VENICE FILM FETE FOCUSES ON IRAN:' Gav' Tells of a Farmer and the Killing of His Cow,"VENICE, Aug. 27  The Venice Film Festival prides itself on revealing new talents. In 1951 it honored ""Rashomon"" with its Golden Lion first prize (now temporarily abolished) and thus introduced the Japanese cinema to the West. Since then it has sought to repeat this Marco Poloesque feat, welcoming motion pictures from unlikely lands, often more out of hope than sound judgment.Today it presented an Iranian film, ""Gav"" (""The Cow""), and at a news conference afterward its director, Daryush Mehrjui, related the history of its shooting and told of the general state of things cinematographic in Iran.Mysteriously SlainMore symbolic than sociological, the film tells of a farmer who owns the only cow of a rural community on the plains. He adores the beast and since it provides the only milk in the vicinity the other inhabitants share his worship, believing the animal to be sacred.While he is away the cow is mysteriously slain and the neighbors, fearing the owner's wrath, bury it, intending to tell him it has run off. When he returns and learns the news, he goes mad and metamorphosizes himself into the cow, shutting himself up in the stable, mooing and nibbling straw. His comrades tie him up to drag him off to a hospital, but he breaks away and throws himself into a ravine. Who killed the cow is not disclosed, but since a sinister trio of uniformed men, wielding scimitars, make nightly raids on the village, it is probably their act.Exhibited here without subtitles, ""Gav"" is doubly mysterious. But there is an honest purpose to its direction and acting, and it conveys effectively the sense of a primitive folk-legend, old but eternal.Japan is represented this year by Akira Kurosawa's ""Dodeska-Den"" (the title is the continual cry of a retarded boy who fancies himself a streetcar conductor). It is a Gorki-cum-Zola study of the human wreckage afloat in a settlement of dilapidated shacks.A dramatic power lifts the multiple tragedy above its oppressive materials, lending it a somber grandeur and relieving its murky gloom with compassion and some sudden shafts of ironic humor. What the film offers is a sort of contemporary Japanese version of ""The Lower Depths,"" in treatment often more Russian than Nipponese.",1971-08-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Hippie Vampire:' Let's Scare Jessica to Death' Arrives,"The thinking man's vampire movie, probably a secret dream for at least half the world's young filmmakers, tries to rise again in John Hancock's ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater. Although a disappointment generally, there are several things going for it; among them, the pleasantly aggressive title, which has, as is proper, only the most casual relation to the movie.The movie does have a Jessica (Zohra Lampert), just recovered from a nervous breakdown, who, with her husband (Barton Heyman) and a family friend (Kevin O'Conner) renounces the New York rat race and takes possession of a clammy old house in Connecticut. On their very first night they encounter Emily (Mariclare Costello), a young wayfaring hippie who has gotten into the house before them and whom they ask to stay a while. She stays and staysindeed, she will never leaveand after both men have been, well, bitten by her, it becomes apparent that Emily is none other than the 100-year-old vampire who occupies the depths of the local cove and has in the course of time made an impression on all the men in the nearby town.The local cove and the nearby town and the rest of the film's setting, along the Connecticut River below Hadlyme, are among the other pleasures of ""Lets Scare Jessica to Death,"" which brings a rather discerning sense of place and season to its woods and its waters and the stairs and corridors of its ramshackle house. But toward its genre it develops rather less feeling, and after an initial homage to the traditional coffin crossing the water (in fact, a bass-violin case in the back of the couple's hearse-station wagon being ferried over the river) and a momentary camera angle out of Dreyer's great ""Vampyr,"" it tends to lose much sense of what kind of movie it is.It therefore becomes several kinds of movie, sacrificing some of its best ideas to trivial shock effect, relinquishing even the slightest claim to suspension of disbelief and sending Zohra Lampert continually scurrying over a countryside occupied by creatures that look less like vampire victims than like science-fiction robots out of a different film in a different decade. You may not think it possible for a movie like this to say that at a certain point it ceases to make sense, but that is really what happens to ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" within a half hour of its beginning.Among the actors only Miss Lampert develops a characterization. And although she is beautiful and, as always, breathlessly appealing, she projects a personality too forcefully complex for a role that requires only sympathetic passivity in the face of persecution.",1971-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Miller was concerned with what most travel writers dare not treat national character. I really think travel books should concentrate on little else.

us,"Screen: 'Samurai Assassin,' Among Best of Its Kind:Mifune Is the Unwitting Murderer of Father Feature at Bijou Was Directed by Okamoto","Among the countless samurai dramas to have played in the current Bijou Cinema Japanese film series, Kihachi Okamoto's ""Samurai Assassin,"" which opened yesterday, must rank among the best. By no means great moviemaking, and overly given to that tiresomely artful manipulation of deep perspective that seems the fatal temptation of every second Japanese director, it is nevertheless a work of considerable craftsmanship with excellent performances and a rather pleasant regard for what may be done in a film that is understood as deriving from the art of fiction.Like a good many samurai dramas, ""Samurai Assassin"" builds upon historical event, and, as in a good many samurai dramas, the actual event doesn't matter very much. Indeed, the film is at painSatos to rewrite history as it tells how in the early spring of 1860 the Tokugawa First Minister Ii was ambushed outside the palace gate by a group of samurai working for the Mito clan and was beheaded by one Tsuruchiyo Shinno (Toshiro Mifune), an aspirant eager to test himself, who did not know that he was in fact Ii's illegitimate son.Shinno is of course fictional, but the film approaches him through the investigation of his personal history, which brushes tragedy as we learn that he intends to prove the nobility of his unknown parentage by killing his father, and then declines into bitter irony because there is finally no recognition, and he remains ignorant of what he has done to the end.Although the climactic ambush is well and modestly handled (Mifune is never outnumbered by more than 6 to 1) and the revelation of tragic potential carries considerable structural interest, ""Samurai Assassin"" is much the best in its earlier parts, as the Mito men investigate their strange, unkempt new member and in bits and pieces report his story back to their leader. It is a cold, wet spring as the assassins huddle near the palace gate or sit in their rooms waiting for the time to strike, and the gloom seems concentrated in the intelligent, brooding, ugly face of their leader (Yunosuko Ito), who presides almost as a spiritual presence over the unfolding story and the moods of the film.In the treatment of the exposition, and in the fine performance of Ito, the film develops a kind of reflective, low-keyed tension that does not so much pack its revelations together as allow them the time, and indeed the spaces, in which to spread out and so become the evocation of an atmosphere that is, as much as anything else, the meaning of ""Samurai Assassin."" For everything that is learned serves to deepen the mystery  until the pattern of discovery very nearly does conform to the intricacies of a life.",1971-08-30T05:00:00+0000
