She was born on June 26, 1912 in Chicago, the daughter of Conyers Read, a historian, and Edith Coulson Kirk Read. She grew up in Villanova, PA., and graduated from Vassar College in 1933. At Vassar, she saw classmates forced to withdraw because of the Great Depression, and so organized a successful undergraduate effort to raise enough funds to bring them all back. In 1932-33, she was elected head of the Vassar student body and vice president of the National Federation of Students. In 1933-34, she worked as assistant dean in charge of residence halls at Barnard College and as grading supervisor for the Educational Testing Service. She received an M.A. in Sociology from Columbia University (1934) and, with support from a Vassar fellowship, a Ph.D. in history from Yale University (1938). At Yale she was drawn into the study of English parliamentary history under the aegis of Hartley Simpson and Wallace Notestein. In 1938, she married Richard W. Foster, a bookseller; they had four sons. She returned to academic life in 1953 as a part-time instructor of history at Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA (assistant professor 1956, associate 1962) and a visiting associate professor at the University of Delaware (196263). Her first book, ''Proceedings in Parliament 1610'' (2 volumes, 1965), established her as a leading scholar of Stuart England. She was appointed Research Fellow and Acting Director of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History (1965) and Professor of History at Bryn Mawr College (professor emeritus 1981). As first dean of the Bryn Mawr Graduate School (1966-70), she reorganized it as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (dean 1970-73). She worked to raise the faculty and student standards of the Graduate School and to enhance its position nationally, especially through her service on the Committee on Policies, Plans and Resolutions and on the Executive Committee of the Council of Graduate Schools. She presided over a period of rapid growth in the Graduate School, including two new programs (Biochemistry and the History of Science), and was an effective seeker of federal funds for education. She also found financial support for part-time study and actively encouraged graduate student self-government and faculty research. Her interests in the history of English parliamentary and judicial procedure and recordkeeping were further developed in three books, ''The House of Lords 1603-1649'' (1983) and two studies of Henry Elsyng, clerk of the parliaments 1621-35, ''The Painful Labour of Mr. Elsyng'' (1972) and ''Judicature in Parliament by Henry Elsyng Clerk of the Parliaments'' (1991), and in numerous articles. After retirement, she was special advisor to the president of Bryn Mawr College on various projects, including design and construction of new library facilities and the expansion of the science building, and continued her lifelong association with the editorial board and advisory council of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History. In 1979, the Yale Graduate School awarded her its Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal for outstanding achievement in scholarship, teaching and academic administration. She was a member of the American Historical Association (editorial board of the ''American Historical Review,'' 1979-81), the Conference on British Studies (council, 1968-73), the Royal Historical Society, Society of Antiquaries, the British Museum, Middle Atlantic Conference on British Studies and other professional associations. In civic and private life, she was active for some years in the Pennsylvania League of Women Voters and the Federation for Planned Parenthood, and was always interested in supporting education opportunities for women. She is survived by her husband, Richard W. Foster; sons Richard C., Timothy, Benjamin R. and Daniel W.; and six grandchildren.",1999-12-02T05:00:00+0000

All three methods are linked to a slightly higher risk of brain injury than a normal, spontaneous birth, but researchers say the increased risk appears to be due to abnormal labor, rather than to the method of delivery.

us,An Encyclopedia of Lost Practices; The Cigarette,"An amerindian invention (circa a.d. 1400) designed to wreak revenge on genocidal Europeans by addicting them to the inhalation of carcinogenic fumes from a lighted bundle of tobacco leaves. Far and away the most popular form of recreational suicide ever devised, by the late 20th century smoking had become the object of an ethical/medical/legal imbroglio that reached its apogee in 2010, when the precedent set by government bans on smoking was used to forbid fried eggs, going without an overcoat in cold weather, not using sunscreen at the beach and thousands of other human activities alleged to be self-destructive. Narrowly defining the pursuit of happiness, the United States Supreme Court had ruled in Snopes v. Lucky Strike (2007) that happiness by definition excluded any and all activities posing potential dangers to health and safety and awarded Snopes $16 billion in damages. Secretary of Public Safety Ralph Nader (see ''The Cromwell of Connecticut,'' p. 398) interpreted the ruling narrowly and applied it vigorously, ultimately banning the driving of automobiles, aviation, swimming, contact sports and even living in houses -- where statistics showed most fatal accidents occurred -- as risky and thus inimical to the pursuit of happiness. The long-term results were by and large salutary: for example, class-action lawsuits dried up and lawyers vanished overnight and the difficulty of dying spurred such population growth (see ''The Safety-Boomer Generation,'' p. 983) that America's No. 1 export by 2342 was families, leading to the colonization of the moon, Mars and Detroit.

After 98 strategic missions he was reported missing in action following a raid over Northern France just after being credited with his ninth downed plane. The British Air Ministry awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross, not knowing his whereabouts.

Mahon was finally liberated by Patton's 3rd Army in 1945. After the war, Mahon became the personal pilot, and later manager of movie star Errol Flynn producing a number of Flynn and Gina Lollabrigida pictures, as well as a considerable output of children's programs.

Still active in business and pursuing his dreams through his last days, Mr. Goldhar left major accomplishments and a loving circle of family and friends behind him. Mr. Goldhar devoted over 50 years of his life to voluntary service, and he was recently invested with the Order of Ontario. He was well known for his substantial contributions to technology, manufacturing and natural resources companies in Canada and internationally, in particular Ontario Store Fixtures, Fantom Technologies and Fifty Plus Net International.

Founding president of the President's Council of the Canadian Opera Company and a founding director of the York Racquet Club, Hockley Valley Ski Club and the Island Yacht Club, Mr. Goldhar was a leader who constructively countered the exclusion of Jews from many of the city's social organizations by opening new opportunities for them through these organizations. Mr. Goldhar was treasurer of the building campaign for the northern YMHA and served for many years as director of the Canadian Society for the Weizmann Institute of Science. At the time of his death, Mr. Goldhar was an active director of ''CARP,'' the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, and a founding director of Fifty Plus Net International, the leading Internet supplier to seniors in Canada.

At his bedside were his wife Judy Church Swanson, their daughters Katie and Erica and his mothr, Arline Baker Swanson, of Foster City, CA. He was 52. Selected by Esquire Magazine as one whose life and work exemplified America's highest qualities and values. Courage, Originality, Ingenuity, Vision, Selfless Service. He was regarded as one of the best of a new generation. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Bob grew up in Florida, the only child of a career employee at Eastern Airlines. Bob graduated from Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, earning both his BS in Chemistry and an MS degree from MIT's Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. Bob was one of the first MIT graduates to complete his MBA in his fourth year of college. Bob was a loyal MIT alumnus serving as trustee, as well as on various visiting committees. Bob gained world acclaim for starting the biotech revolution, which has impacted the lives of millions of people throughout the world. He began his career as an investment officer at Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd. and later became a partner at Kleiner & Perkins. Bob's life goal was to change the world for the better and he did. In 1976, at age 29, Bob and UCSF scientist, Herbert W. Boyer, founded Genentech, Inc. Genentech was the first and most successful biotechnology firm. Bob served as CEO of Genentech from 1976-1990 and as Chairman of the Board from 1990-1996. Under his guidance, Genentech developed human insulin, interferon, human growth hormone and TPA. In recent years, Bob continued his passion for creating science by working with a wide range of pioneering startup companies, including serving as Chairman of Tularik. Throughout his life, Bob received many awards, but the ones he valued most were for his daughters' soccer teams. Bob's first priority was always his family. He was a loving and committed man who continually supported his community. He served as trustee of the San Francisco Ballet, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the San Jose Tech Center and as Chairman of the Board of Nueva School.

So he took his jazz conception, complete with elements of a nightclub show, into cathedrals. On record, the Sacred Concerts are bold curiosities, sometimes streaked with greatness, sometimes grand and less than inspired. They're not universally admired and are seldom performed.

The possibility that the English word is linked to the Hebrew one is intriguing if uncertain. When Moses is commanded to send spies to the Land of Canaan, the Bible tells us, ''These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the Land'' (Numbers 13:16). What is often translated as ''to spy'' is, in Hebrew, ''latoor.'' ''La'' means ''to,'' and the root ''toor'' connotes more a notion of searching than spying. This is corroborated in the verse that follows, ''See the Land, what it is'' as well as in Ecclesiastes 1:13, (''To seek and to search'' -- latoor).",1999-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Cheerfully Doomed,"Most of the short stories in NAKED PUEBLO (Harmony, $21), Mark Jude Poirier's first collection, take place in or around Tucson; they describe cramped, dysfunctional lives in wide open spaces. Some of the stories here, including the collection's first (''Son of the Monkey Lady'') and last (''Tilt-a-Whirl'') are explicitly related, but throughout Poirier's book the characters and concerns bleed together so comfortably that one might well think that ''Naked Pueblo'' is the cullings from a promising but unfinished novel. In ''Before the Barbecue Hoedown,'' a stripper's daughter named Jackpot gets a job as personal assistant to a wealthy old woman with a pet pig; in ''Cul-de-Sacs,'' an amorous chimp who lives across the street seems to taunt a man whose marriage is slipping away. Poirier's stories skip amiably from the mundane to the freakish. This is a refreshingly unsentimental collection in which rock climbers, mountain bike enthusiasts, slackers and drunks seem almost cheerfully doomed. When a young man who works at Value Village Thrift Center finds a Donny and Marie Osmond record trunk to pilfer in ''Something Good,'' that's about as good as it gets. In the claustrophobic universe of ''Naked Pueblo,'' there seems to be little better to hope for -- tiny epiphanies and bizarre accidents, drunken maimings and ruined marriages are all treated with the same cool, resigned acceptance. The author's skewed, grimly fatalistic perspective on the not-so-great Southwest will probably serve him well should he direct his attention away from his hometown. His jaundiced but unblinking gaze and his quietly confident voice hint at better work to come. Anthony Bourdain",1999-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Really, Really Old","Over the centuries the Egyptian desert has yielded a seemingly endless bounty of pharaonic antiquities: colossal statues, burial chambers filled with ceremonial objects, detailed reliefs providing tantalizing glimpses of the civilization that flourished along the Nile thousands of years ago. In his introduction to EGYPTIAN TREASURES FROM THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IN CAIRO (Abrams, $75) the Italian scholar Francesco Tiradritti points out that all those crumbling temples and toppled columns were ''simply stones'' in the eyes of early 19th-century Egyptians. The Ottoman-appointed pasha, Muhammad Ali, freely allowed European connoisseurs to take them home for souvenirs. He also authorized the dismantling of ancient monuments for building materials. Even mummies had practical applications -- when incinerated, they produced a fine carbon that proved quite useful in the refining of cane sugar. Like this book, EGYPTIAN ART IN THE AGE OF THE PYRAMIDS (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $90) contains essays by renowned Egyptologists and is richly illustrated with hundreds of black-and-white and color photographs. It focuses on the Old Kingdom -- a 500-year period beginning some 4,500 years ago when necropolises like the Giza pyramids were constructed and sculptural renderings of the human figure were characterized by their ''spare, tender gestures.'' The book's 15 essays covers topics like the pyramids, royal reliefs, statuary and the history of the Old Kingdom. While its narrow focus and staid presentation are suffused with a scholarly tone, ''Egyptian Treasures From the Egyptian Museum in Cairo'' is more immediately appealing, with artfully arranged photographs and illustrations, and an entertaining introduction by Tiradritti on how the museum came to exist. The subjects covered are as diverse as the museum's collection, with essays on Tutankhamun's treasures, the Valley of the Kings and antiquities from the middle and late kingdoms.

Five years later he returned to New York with his cocaine and toy-boy succes de scandale, ''The Vortex.''

The New Jersey Division of Taxation has a system by which residents can check for unclaimed property (this does not include real estate) both in New Jersey and other states just by entering their last name or county and clicking. Once the property has been located, it can then be claimed online. According to Meg Smith, Chief of Operations for the Unclaimed Property Division the turn-around time is three months. Ms. Smith added: ''We just got a call from the Montel Williams Show telling us that they are doing a Christmas show on unclaimed property so that should flood us with inquiries and bump up the time.

An individual of deep intensity and insight, he was always a man of responsibility with a strong sense of right and wrong. Always the professional, he helped so many to lead and seek better lives. He was a man of extraordinary intelligence and always liked to engage others in profound discussion. He was deeply concerned with the issues of the day and addressed life with a strong point of view. He loved music and appreciated beauty at the highest level. Material things were not important as were the principles of life. He graduated high school and college before his time and later graduated from the medical school of Lausanne, Switzerland in 1937. He served his country as a major in the armed forces during World War II. After his service he started a practice in internal medicine. He went on to specialize in the field of psychiatry and achieved the highest training as a psychoanalyst. He was the medical director of adult psychiatry with the Postgraduate Center of Mental Health in New York City. He trained other professionals, lectured, taught, and supervised others in the psychiatric profession in both private and group practice. His standards were of the highest level and he expected the best performance from the people he worked with. He conducted himself with dignity at all times and commanded the respect of others. A truly brilliant man who valued words and concepts, and he did The New York Times crossword puzzle every day with ease. Max Markowitz is survived by his wife of nine years, Anita Bleifeld Beckenstein, Ph.D., and stepson, Kevin L. Beckenstein and wife, Leigh. Max Markowitz was the husband of the late Sarah Kissen Markowitz, MSW for forty one years. He is also survived by his son, Philip Markowitz, M.D and wife, Abby, Miriam and Leah, granddaughters; and by his daughter, Enid Markowitz Garber, husband, David L. Garber, Sumner and Jessica, grandson and granddaughter. Max Markowitz was brother to Lillian Edelman, Claire Greene, and the late Eleanor Rubinstein. He leaves a void never to be filled or forgotten. With deepest love, my mentor, my sweet Max, I was proud to be your wife, Anita B. Markowitz, Ph.D. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.

After his passing, she continued her involvement not only as a benefactress, but also as a member of both the Global Board of Trustees and the American Board of Trustees. Her interest in every program of the University's mission was tremendous. She loved the traditional dimension of the University and was especially concerned with the personal welfare of faculty and students, particularly those who had emigrated from Russia. Indeed, she established the Jack and Pearl Resnick Institute for the Absorbtion and Retraining of Russian Immigrant Scientists, and subsequently built the permanent home of the Resnick Institute. Beyond the actual programs, her warm and loving personality evoked enormous respect from all who had the privilege to know her. She was truly love incarnate. To her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren she was a loving and devoted matriarch whose love was characteristic of her person and all that she did. With this love, she inspired her family to carry on with her same spirit of matchless generosity for every worthy cause, Jewish, American and humanitarian.

The partners and employees of KPMG mourn the loss of their respected colleague who died in New York City on December 7, and offer their condolences to his family. A teacher and mentor, Stanley will always be remembered for his dedication and devotion to the firm and its clients. His legacy will continue. Born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1916, Stanley worked his way through St. John's University at night by doing accounting work for several firms and also by being a Western Union messenger during days. After graduating in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in business administration, Stanley was employed by Barrow Wade Guthrie and Co. (BWG), the oldest and most prestigious accounting firm in the U.S. at that time. During World War II, he handled recruiting duties for the U.S. Navy in San Antonio. After the war, he returned to BWG and became a partner in 1949 at the age of 33. In 1953, three years after BWG merged with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell, Stanley took over the helm of Peat Marwick's banking practice and innovated the specialized department, the precursor to today's Line of Business structure. Stanley created the first formalized mentorship program between partners and staff and introduced long-range planning and budgeting disciplines to the firm, now known as KPMG. In 1955, he played a vital role in getting approval of a major financial industry merger that would create Chase Manhattan Bank. After retiring from the firm in 1976, President Gerald Ford nominated Stanley to become Comptroller of the Currency, but Congressional hearings were never held about it. Stanley went on to be a consultant for the Association of Bank Holding Companies and The Bank Administration Institute. The Stanley E. Shirk Scholarship Fund was established in 1992 at St. John's University through funds raised by retired and active KPMG partners and matched by the KPMG Foundation. In 1994, St. John's University bestowed upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Commercial Science. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to the Stanley E. Shirk Scholarship Fund, St. John's University, 8000 Utopia Parkway, Jamaica, New York 11439.

This trilogy of two-CD sets traces the history of electronic dance music from the mid-80's to the present, as seen through the eyes of Warp, the pioneering label in Sheffield, England, on its 10th anniversary. One of the great tragedies of electronica is that its greatest underground singles and compilations tend to go out of print within a year. The ''Influences'' CD's in this series remedies that by collecting music from Chicago acts like Phuture and Mr. Fingers, who helped inspire the development of techno in Britain. The discs also include that British techno precursor known as acid house, with tracks from A Guy Called Gerald and 808 State. ''Classics'' focuses on rare early singles from Warp by LFO, Nightmares on Wax and others. And ''Remixes'' points to a clinical future, with the soulful minimalism of the ''Influences'' CD giving way to a dry laboratory approach as rock and electronic acts (from Spiritualized to the Aphex Twin) are given music from the Warp back catalog to remix.

Together they formed Guns 'n' Roses and proceeded to make a noise as complex and fascinating and gorgeous and repulsive as any heard since the Reagan era. This double CD tells their story, in the roar of an audience Mr. Rose craves but constantly scorns, in his sarcastic onstage patter, which oddly resembles that of his purported enemy, Kurt Cobain, and in 22 tracks of overbearing, awesome rock 'n' roll.

They borrowed songs from their friends Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil and wrote their own; they built arrangements from garage-band guitars, or marimbas and glockenspiels, or Baroque recorders, or tape tricks, or elaborate vocal counterpoint featuring their breathy Brazilian chanteuse, Rita Lee.

He didn't have the cracks in his high voice back then that he does now, and the producer Fred Mendelsohn let Mr. Scott's endlessly elongated vowels flood the tracks at crescendos, making the tunes feel like a blush going through your body.

It still exists after numerous lineup changes, but this two-disc collection sums up its best years, 1967 to 1975, when Sandy Denny was its lead singer and Richard Thompson was writing songs. The album follows the group from its early phase, influenced by Bob Dylan and Jefferson Airplane, to its rediscovery of England's traditional repertory, which it rearranged with electric guitars and modal fiddle lines. Denny, who died in 1978, had an indelible voice, smoky and gentle but indomitable. While Fairport's later male vocalists were jaunty enough, it's Denny's songs that remain haunting.

us,ALBUM OF THE WEEK,"Q-TIP: ''Amplified'' (Arista). A Tribe Called Quest disbanded last year, but its great insight lingers on with Q-Tip's ''Amplified,'' the first solo album by a Tribe member. Where hip-hop is saturated with booming bass lines and larger-than-life voices, Q-Tip defies both mandates to breeze through the din. The tracks on ''Amplified,'' produced by Q-Tip and Jay Dee, pare bass lines to clipped syncopations, and Q-Tip raps without rushing or raising his voice. Although Busta Rhymes and a self-parodying Korn show up at the end of the album, most of ''Amplified'' is Q-Tip on his own or with the women he's sweet-talking. He's secure in his boasts and playful in his seductions, and the syncopations of his monotone are as much percussion as speech. With electronic blips, tersely swinging drumbeats, two-chord vamps and tightly rationed doses of melody, ''Amplified'' turns weightless, transparent rhythms into hypnosis.

An average-to-good vocalist, she teams up with such world-class singers as Celine Dion, Trisha Yearwood, Elton John and, uh, Elmo (of ''Sesame Street'') for duets on this surprisingly winning Christmas album. Highlights include a collaboration with Cher to recast the Phil Spector production ''Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)'' in the image of Cher's hit ''Believe'' (complete with the robotic vocal effect) and a version of ''The Little Drummer Boy'' with Lauryn Hill giving a laid-back jazz reading.

us,"Holiday Albums; Musical Merry-Making, From Raunchy to Reverent","LOW: ''Christmas'' (Chair Kicker's Union/Kranky). ''Silent Night'' is very silent indeed when Low, a trio from Duluth, Minn., that specializes in quiet dynamics, minimal instrumentation and morosely droning rock, gets its hands on it. This may not be a typical Christmas album, but it is one of the best. That's not only because it's an oddity for a minimalist rock band with a small cult following to record an entire album of Christmas classics and originals, but also because the group approaches its subject without irony, without synthetic joy and without deviating from its ever-improving slow-motion pop.

When a new version of the 1984 concert film ''Stop Making Sense'' was released to movie theaters this year, Talking Heads took advantage of the full length of a CD to add seven songs to the original album. The expanded Talking Heads band was unstoppable in 1984; David Byrne's arty conceits were embedded in funk that was simultaneously precise and reckless, a polyrhythmic chatter of guitars, keyboards and percussion. The new album sequence restores the gradual buildup of the concert, adds some unhinged guitar in ''Making Flippy Floppy'' and reaches a new peak in the finale, ''Cross-Eyed and Painless.''

Young, chubby Welcome has been too busy moving through a series of foster homes to cultivate any friends or any Christmas spirit. He finds both when Mr. Hamp, the school janitor, rescues him from the taunts of other children and takes him under his kind, loving wing. Their warm intergenerational relationship, a signature theme of Polacco's, fills Welcome's lonely life with love and happiness. ",1999-12-19T05:00:00+0000

Downtown Tulsa has changed so little in the last half-century that a traveler who returned after 50 years would find it familiar. But since 1997, Tulsans who thought they knew the city well have been startled to learn of a 1921 riot in which hundreds of people were shot, burned alive or tied to cars and dragged to death. These grim facts have been churned up by the Tulsa Race Riot Commission, created by the Oklahoma Legislature two years ago to investigate the country's bloodiest civil disturbance of the century. The commission report, due on Gov. Frank Keating's desk early next year, will attempt to fix a death toll, provide an estimate of property damage and explain what caused the disturbance in the first place. But the most controversial mission is to determine whether or not the state should pay reparations either to the black district of Greenwood or to individual survivors. The issue has spawned a contentious dispute in the city as a whole -- and reopened interest in the race wars that swept the country early in this century, when whites and African-Americans engaged in armed combat in the streets.",1999-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Cash Crop,"It's not corn that's as high as an elephant's eye in Oklahoma these days. In Tim Tharp's first novel, FALLING DARK (Milkweed, $21.95), harvest season in America's heartland means rounding up old friends and heading out into the fields with axes, machetes and scissors to bring in this year's marijuana crop. The marijuana hidden among the bloodweed is one of several incongruities in the book, some lovely, some forced. The farm's owner, Sam Casey, is no drug lord; in fact, he is mild-mannered, even-tempered and looking to get out of the pot business. A straight-arrow plainsman? Actually, he purchased the farm from the Sunshine People, a commune to which he once belonged, whose constitution consisted of a single word: ''We.'' Then there is Sam's associate, Roy Dale, whose nice-guy name (think Roy Rogers and Dale Evans) belies a dark heart. When a beleaguered, alcoholic single mother is almost raped outside a bar, Roy pummels her attacker -- but then gets her drunk and has sex with her himself. When we later learn Roy once wanted to run a farm for children, though, it's too much (and too late -- he's too evil). Tharp's story tumbles out in a rush -- he lets his dialogue run free without quotation marks, and his sentences become long streams of detail. The result is a fast-flowing, vivid tale of a new kind of prairie that is home to an old kind of conflict, good versus evil. Liam Callanan",1999-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Click! Click! for a Century,"Americans embraced photography in the mid-19th century; 150 years, and countless millions of photographs later, their ardor has not diminished. It is hard to imagine an aspect of 20th-century American life, whether personal or political, intellectual or commercial, that photography has not influenced. The United States has been a dominant force in photography for the last hundred years, thanks to the sheer mass of its output, its technological innovations and the continual infusions of creativity from its immigrants. In AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY: A Century of Images (Chronicle, $40), the photography critic Vicki Goldberg and the art historian Robert Silberman have neatly divided the century into three chronological parts and written 30 brief essays, each focusing on notable aspects, from a photographic point of view, of a particular period. From the authors' vantage point, it certainly seems as though the first two-thirds of the century are when the innovation, energy, passion and commitment are, and the last period is more analytical and self-referential -- rather like life itself. There is a photograph for each year of the century, plus others to illustrate chosen themes like war photography or the rise of the news agencies. Goldberg (who also writes about photography for The Times) and Silberman have succeeded in bringing a semblance of order to the past century of photography and have given a lively and informative overview of its many facets.

It was suddenly possible for a viewer to comprehend the charm that people who have seen him in person have noted, but that had been missing from his television appearances.

The violence becomes addictive as the carnage builds to a cannibalistic feast.",1999-12-24T05:00:00+0000

Written by a rascally Dominican priest, Francesco Colonna, who lived to 94, it is a dream allegory about one Poliphilo's journey through an enchanted isle where he tells the story of his fatal love for a perfect woman. It lavishes such minute attention on all the senses and so thoroughly encompasses the passions of the Renaissance -- for painting, clothes, jewelry, music, language, theater, dance, Greek and Roman ruins and literature and the beauty of the human body -- that it is hard to think of any book quite so sensuous. It intoxicated European writers for two centuries, although few were so foolish as to try imitation, for Colonna invented his own language, an Italian so crammed with words borrowed from recondite Latin sources that it bewildered even his learned countrymen. At last, Joscelyn Godwin, a professor of music at Colgate University known widely for studies of ancient mystical religions, provides the first clear English version. No translation, if it is to be useful, could reproduce the effect of the original, but Godwin gives a hint, rendering a small passage literally -- and hilariously. He gives a brief history of the book but does not burden the text with notes or corrections of Colonna's often amusing misunderstandings of the ancients he worshiped. The publisher is similarly restrained in paying its respect; this edition reproduces the size and typography of the Aldine original and is printed in a modern Poliphilus, the typeface Aldus had designed for it 500 years ago.

With no aviaries, fountains or Pottery Barns in sight, the former girdle factory has curving white walls, a concrete floor and objet-trouve light fixtures. The tenants, mostly designers and artisans setting up their first retail ventures, range from Otte, a tiny, bright pink clothing boutique dominated by a giant chandelier, to AK-ME, a card and gift shop painted with hot-rod-style flames. The building's common area is available for performances and readings, and unleased store fronts are being used as temporary art galleries. George Mansfield, an artist who designed and helped to develop the space, said: ''When you say 'mall,' people think chain stores, color schemes, matching signs. That's not what this is about.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; New York Transformations,"''The city is like poetry,'' E. B. White wrote of Manhattan: ''it compresses all life, all races and breeds, into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines.'' NEW YORK: An Illustrated History (Knopf, $60) is a fit metaphor for a great metropolis -- big enough for two laps, it can easily fill a winter of reading and browsing. In addition to the authors, Ric Burns and James Sanders, and the picture editor, Lisa Ades, the book lists a team of contributing historians: Carol Berkin, Marshall Berman, Robert A. Caro, Daniel Czitrom, Kenneth T. Jackson, David Levering Lewis, Phillip Lopate, Robert A. M. Stern and Mike Wallace. The book is, as such collaborations go, narratively crisp, balanced and well researched, with room for everyone from Washington Irving to Allen Ginsberg and from Emma Lazarus to Le Corbusier to have a say, but without any particular authorial voice or tone. The illustrations, many published for the first time, are the glory of the book, capturing a sense of the city changing and evolving, spreading over and transforming -- many times. From the cover photograph of bright intersections shining out of the nighttime grid of the city, to the back cover photo of a crowd inside the golden glow of Pennsylvania Station, this ravishing book is the visual equivalent of the poem White describes, ''whose magic is comprehensible to millions of permanent residents -- but whose full meaning will always remain elusive.''

The 43-year-old farmer was walking south along Zyhdi Lahi Street, one of the main thoroughfares of the Rus marketplace in downtown Shkoder, his hands weighted down with plastic bags filled with his day's purchases. Just in front of a small tobacco kiosk at the northwest corner of Rus Square, a burly man who looked to be in his mid-30's suddenly stepped into Lamthi's path, brought up a Kalashnikov assault rifle, shot him 21 times and walked away. None of the witnesses came forward to identify the killer. Instead, a wall of silence immediately descended. Today, 16 months later, Lamthi's murder remains officially unsolved, despite the fact that almost everyone knows exactly who killed him. A strange event, but not in Albania.",1999-12-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Bradley proposes an expensive plan that invites uninsured people to buy coverage, with the help of federal subsidies for families with incomes of up to about $50,000, from any one of hundreds of private plans that serve federal employees. Mr. Gore, arguing that Mr. Bradley's plan would lead to unacceptably high tax increases or federal spending cuts, proposes taking modest steps that would reduce the number of uninsured people by expanding existing federal-state programs to cover more low-income children and their parents. He would also offer tax credits to individuals and small businesses that acquire coverage.",1999-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DE KRUYF, JOHANNES","de KRUYF-Johannes. A legendary expert on Netherlands philately, passed away at his home in Bergenfield, NJ on Wednesday, October 6, 1999 at the age of 92. Johannes, ''Jo'' to his friends, left Holland for Canada in 1928 and came to New York the following year. There he worked 40 years for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. His philatelic accomplishments are many. In 1934, together with Professor Schiller of Columbia University, C.W. Gibbs, and Sidney Lake, he founded the Netherlands & Colonies Philately group of New York. They met on a regular basis at the famed Collector's Club on 35th Street until 1976. Membership lists read like a virtual Who's Who of Dutch philately. For 42 years, Jo was the driving force behind the NCP, serving in various capacities from treasurer to president. He edited the NCP publication for almost its entire existence and it remains the definitive philatelic resource to this day. In May 1940, Schiller and de Kruyf co-authored and published, with the help of A.M. Benders and P.C. Korteweg, the now famous Manual of Stamps of the Netherlands, Netherlands Indies, Curacao and Surinam. No more comprehensive catalogue has been issued to date. Its cover was orange to emphasize the solidarity with the House of Orange, the Dutch royal family in a time of war. Jo managed to assemble at least two dozen major collections and generously shared his knowledge in numerous articles and lectures at the Collector's Club. One of his areas of expertise was the detection of stamp forgeries of the Netherlands and Dutch East Indies, and for many years he served as consultant to the American Philatelic Society in this field. His contributions to Dutch philately were recognized when the Nederlanse Bond van Filatelisten Verenigingen awarded him its highest honor, the Costerus medal in 1964. Jo was also an accomplished painter of landscapes, where he reveals his keen sensitivity to the natural world. His special skill in capturing the essence of certain sites in Canada, Maine, the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, Scotland, Norway, and other locales gives his oils and watercolors a certain intimate immediacy appreciated by all who see them. Jo's large-scale paintings and miniatures have been exhibited in Maine, where he often vacationed with his wife Alma who predeceased him in 1994. A selection of these works were recently exhibited in the Bergenfield Public Library and the New Milford Library where some of the miniatures were on display in November. Jo credited his parents with starting him on his lifelong hobbies when he was sick as a child for two years with tuberculosis. He said that he got stamps from his father and paints from his mother to keep him from being bored while resting. Although Jo has no direct descendants, nor any known relatives left in the Netherlands, he will be remembered by those privileged to know him as a wise human being with a wry sense of humor, who enjoyed life. His many kindnesses will not be forgotten and he will be greatly missed, especially by Betsy, Janet and Jock Morrison, Jan and Clay Morrison, Karin de Vries, neighbors, and members of the Central Unitarian Church in Paramus, New Jersey and Kees Adema.",1999-12-28T05:00:00+0000

The family, along with the goat, huddled on a single vermin-infested straw mat. Not that kings and queens in gloomy castles had it much better. Privacy was nonexistent, and the nobility, one historian has written, ''didn't so much live in their houses as camp in them.'' They spent most of their time on the road, visiting far-flung estates. Tellingly, the French and Italian words for furniture at this time -- mobilier and mobilia -- meant ''movables.'' It would be a while before Europeans settled down.",1999-12-30T05:00:00+0000
