Meeting with an association of foreign journalists in Sri Lanka for the first time in three years, Mr. Rajapaksa said that recent resolutions criticizing Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council could arise from a hidden agenda. On Thursday, the State Department released a report that was highly critical of the Rajapaksa government, claiming that in 2013 attacks, harassment, and threats by pro-government loyalists against critics of the government were prevalent, contributed to widespread self-censorship by journalists, and diminished democratic activity. On Friday, Mr. Rajapaksa likened the friction between the United States and Sri Lanka to Cassius Clay fighting with a schoolboy, a reference to the boxer now known as Muhammad Ali.

Augustine, who possesses formidable puppet-making and pantomime talents, is our main hobo clown  a genre, we learn, at the bottom of the clown chain of command, well below patrician whiteface and the middle-rank, red-nosed Auguste. He is not only forced to become a military fighting machine, trained to shoot and bayonet to kill (the work employs considerable World War I imagery), he also tenderly nurses a badly injured pit bull, another creature raised to fight on command, and even helps a delicate little (puppet) bird convalesce. Amid all this arrive a few theatrically unbearable moments. At one point, we hear two parents, on the other side of a locked door, as they wail for their (puppet) war-vet son, an amputee and PTSD sufferer, who has apparently killed himself in his bedroom.

Putins aggression doesnt undermine anything I wrote a week ago about the limits of Russian power and the essential implausibilityof the Kremlins grand ambitions; this gambit is a salvage operation following a major political setback, not a plausible stepping-stone toward some sweeping long-term objective. The echoes of earlier Russian aggressions are real, but the comparison to Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Hungary in 1956 should be illuminating: In those cases, Russia was projecting power well beyond its borders, and using force to keep a relatively-vast sphere of influence intact, whereas in this case its projecting power  in the Russian-speaking regions of a former Soviet republic/czarist province. You can make the case that Putin is playing as well as he can with a losing hand, or you can make the case that hes out of touch with realityand stumbling into an epic disaster. But either way, what were witnessing isnt the re-emergence of Russia as a major geopolitical threat to the United States and our allies, unless by major geopolitical threat you mean weakened ex-empire struggling to control its own periphery.",2014-03-04T21:13:16+0000

Since 1949, the sanctuary has done just that, but Ms. Cerios 18th-century house has been slowly rotting away. In a collaboration between the Urban Design Group of Bristol, R.I., and Foster Associates of Portsmouth, R.I., the place was taken down to its studs and meticulously reconstructed. Its spare, though not spartan, so the emphasis is on the architectural details and the views. The farmhouse has seven bedrooms and sleeps 16 (there are three bunk beds in one bedroom); it is open for retreats of all sorts, from family weekend roosts to yoga retreats. Natasha Harrison, executive director of the Norman Bird Sanctuary, said that next year she hopes to host artists residencies, too.

The maximum sentence in Tuesdays case could have been five years in prison, and the relatively light term given to Romain Letellier, 27, suggested that both prosecutors and judges were still considering how to apply the new law.

us,The Story Behind the SAT Overhaul,"In July 2012, a few months before he was to officially take over as president of the College Board, David Coleman invited Les Perelman, then a director of writing at M.I.T., to come meet with him in Lower Manhattan. Of the many things the College Board does  take part in research, develop education policy, create curriculums  it is perhaps most recognized as the organization that administers the SAT, and Perelman was one of the exams harshest and most relentless critics. Since 2005, when the College Board added an essay to the SAT (raising the total possible score from 1,600 to 2,400), Perelman had been conducting research that highlighted what he believed were the inherent absurdities in how the essay questions were formulated and scored. His earliest findings showed that length, more than any other factor, correlated with a high score on the essay. More recently, Perelman coached 16 students who were retaking the test after having received mediocre scores on the essay section. He told them that details mattered but factual accuracy didnt. You can tell them the War of 1812 began in 1945, he said. He encouraged them to sprinkle in little-used but fancy words like plethora or myriad and to use two or three preselected quotes from prominent figures like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, regardless of whether they were relevant to the question asked. Fifteen of his pupils scored higher than the 90th percentile on the essay when they retook the exam, he said.",2014-03-06T10:00:15+0000

The ruling, which said that the rights of the former officer, Gen. Ilker Basbug, who served as military chief of staff from 2008 to 2010, had been violated, paved the way for his possible release from an Istanbul prison. The Constitutional Court said the lower court that held the five-year trial failed to publish its detailed reasoning for its verdict and send it to the appeals court, obstructing the defendants right to an appeal and violating a constitutional clause concerning personal freedom. The ruling could also be used as a precedent for the release of many of the more than 270 defendants who spent several years in prison before their convictions last year in the case known as the Ergenekon affair. The governments prosecution of that case was seen as an effort to curb the role of Turkeys military in politics, but it was also criticized for ensnaring people who were opponents of the government, including politicians, academics, journalists and writers.

(TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: FOOD IN THE MOVIES A visual feast begins with Eat Drink Man Woman (1994), above, Ang Lees Oscar-nominated drama for best foreign-language film about a father, Mr. Chu (Sihung Lung)  the greatest chef in Taipei  who has lost his joie de vivre, and his three beautiful star-crossed daughters (Chien-Lien Wu, Kuei-Mei-Yang and Yu-Wen Wang), who cannot escape his spell. Tensions are so high that at their extravagant Sunday dinners, the family can barely eat. And so he begins to supply spectacular lunches to the daughter of a family friend, who is too young to realize that his cooking is flawed: He has lost the use of his taste buds. Wonderfully seductive, and nicely knowing about all of its characters appetites, Eat Drink Man Woman makes for an uncomplicatedly pleasant experience, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. This films use of food is both voluptuous and serious, amplifying the story even as it offers an irresistible diversion. The film succeeds in presenting Mr. Chus intricate cooking (rendered for the camera by three amazingly artful chefs) as an expression of larger traditionalism and as an endangered art. Of the title, she added: Food and sex, one character says succinctly, amplifying that four-ideogram phrase. Basic human desires. Cant avoid them. In Mostly Martha (2002), at 10:15, Martha (Martina Gedeck), a single, workaholic chef in Hamburg, Germany, finds her carefully organized life in disarray when she must care for her dead sisters 8-year-old daughter (Maxime Foerste). Enter Mario, the Italian sous-chef (Sergio Castellitto) who can charm everyone but Martha. The movie succeeds because the writer and director, Sandra Nettelbeck, seems as obsessive as her titular heroine, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times.

us,A Walk Through Time,"In the winter of 1933, an 18-year-old named Patrick Leigh Fermor set out from the Hook of Holland to cross Europe on foot. His goal was Istanbul, which he bookishly insisted on calling Constantinople. He had little more in his rucksack than a volume of Horace and a few blank notebooks. He also had a bad reputation: The masters who expelled him from school  for a flirtation with a local girl  saw only a dangerous mixture of sophistication and recklessness. He spent the next year charming his way through a doomed prewar landscape of landed aristocrats, feudal peasants and benevolent monks, sleeping alternately in schlosses and hayricks. It was a journey that would become legendary, not so much for the extraordinary things he saw and recorded as for his prose  an utterly unique, hybrid vehicle that combines youthful exuberance with a dense, dauntingly erudite display of verbal artifice. Unlike most authors of travel literature (a rattlebag genre that doesnt really do him justice) Leigh Fermor does not confine his role to that of camera obscura. He builds dense whorls of wordplay to echo the carvings in an old church door; he slips into baroque historical fantasias, scattering a shrapnel of words like gabions, hydromel, eyot and swingletrees at the unsuspecting reader. In between salvos, there are moments of ferocious humor and quiet, lyrical beauty.",2014-03-07T15:50:53+0000

What Gates didnt mention (but surely knew) was that Bark contains a direct tribute to Nabokov: Moores story Referential, about a couple visiting the womans son in a mental hospital, borrows its premise and some of its language from Nabokovs 1948 story Signs and Symbols, in which the patient imagines that everything happening around him is a veiled reference to his personality and existence.

Seven years later, the couple opened their own studio, determined to introduce yoga to fellow Orthodox Jews in Beit Shemesh. They teach Iyengar yoga, a discipline that encourages the use of props to assist with poses. While yoga is increasingly popular in Israel, Avraham says, it is revolutionary in their neighborhood. Their students, taught in single-sex classes, are encouraged to come as they are, even in day clothes or long skirts, if necessary. The Kolbergs say yoga helps people who spend long days in prayer and study and arent physically active.

The collaboration, available Monday at Colette in Paris and at smythson.com beginning March 31, features pouches, bags and notebooks from the brands Panama Legacy collection, designed by Rory OHanlon. These, together with coordinating keychains, bear the whimsical, surrealist illustrations and calligraphy that the 30-year-old Jones has become renowned for in the worlds of art and fashion. I thought about my favorite examples of artists who work with pure lines: Miro, Picasso, early Hockney and Ben Nicholson, says Jones of her approach to the visuals. Smythsons classic Soho notebook has been rebelliously tagged in gold with the phrases Soho Saint and Soho Sinner; a winking cat adorns a zippered pouch and cross-body bag; a sharp white leather tote bears a cluster of floating eyes. And starting on March 31, the brands Panama notebooks can be custom-embossed with Joness motifs in Smythsons New York store.

She grew up amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood in the 80s, the youngest in a long family line of legendary actors, and made her first television appearance before she was even a year old. But they share an almost obsessive love for movies, particularly black-and-white films made decades ago. Its this connection that makes Osborne and Barrymore light up together as the host and co-host, respectively, of TCMs The Essentials. The show, which premiered in 2001 and airs on Saturday nights, puts timeless, classic films in the spotlight with commentary and fun bits of trivia supplied by the hosts (in the past those duties have been taken up by everyone from Rob Reiner to Alec Baldwin). This season marks Barrymores third as Osbornes wingwoman, and the two clearly enjoy the back-and-forth banter  as well as the goofy handshakes, thumb wars and screwball comedy moments that often happen after the cameras stop rolling.

Earl Ray Tomblin said he was concerned about the constitutionality of a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the State Legislature passed over the weekend. Twelve states have passed similar bans, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But West Virginia will be the first with a Democratic governor and Democratic-controlled legislature to embrace the 20-week limit if the governor signs the bill. Supporters contend a fetus that age can feel pain, although the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is no scientific evidence for that view. The Supreme Court in January refused to hear an appeal of a lower courts decision to strike down an Arizona law banning most abortions after 20 weeks. In Roe v. Wade in 1973, the high court said women have a right to an abortion until the point of fetal viability, generally seen as 24 weeks. The abortion bill obviously is one that causes me some concern because even the legislative attorneys and others said they feel this bill is unconstitutional, Governor Tomblin said in a statement.

Criminal cases in India often drag on for several years, allowing lawmakers who are charged with crimes to continue to hold their posts and run for re-election. Mondays ruling is part of a push for electoral overhaul in India. In July, the Supreme Court barred people convicted of crimes carrying prison terms of more than five years from running in elections. On Monday, it ruled that lawmakers who are charged with crimes carrying a punishment of more than two years must have a speedy trial. The Association for Democratic Reforms, a nonprofit group that aims to promote electoral transparency, estimates that 30 percent of sitting lawmakers have criminal charges against them.

The court said the men should be released because the Parliament recently reduced the maximum detention period before a conviction to five years, and the prisoners had already been detained longer than that. The court order followed the release of a former army chief last week after the Constitutional Courts ruling critical of the conduct of the recently abolished Special Court that carried out the Ergenekon trial. The trial, which lasted five years, prompted criticism at home and abroad, with several international organizations describing the prosecution of the more than 200 suspects as unfair, with unnecessary arrests, secret witnesses and disputes over evidence. Some Turkish analysts characterized Mondays releases as part of a bid by the government to increase its popularity before local elections in two weeks and gain the upper hand in a power struggle with a pro-Islamic network influential in the judiciary and the police.

Beginning today, though, Du Pasquiers signature colorful, graphic patterns will grace the 20 newest silhouettes hanging in a select 20 of the labels many retail outposts. The collaboration came about when the brands creative director, Iris Alonzo, approached Du Pasquier about painting prints similar to the iconic ones she produced in the 1980s as an original member of the Memphis Group, the Milan-based collective of designers and architects. I thought, Why not? Du Pasquier remembers. It was the first collaboration with a fashion company in many, many years actually because I am a painter. I have not done that kind of work in a long time. And how does the artist feel about American Apparel now that its emblazoned with work from her own hand? These? she asks about the simple frocks, jumpsuits and skirts, minimalist shapes that complement her bright, unruly designs. I will wear them, yes.

This is the most punishing time of year, when they work 12-hour days for 14 weeks without a break. Alberda says they struggle with the long stretches of rehearsal indoors, under artificial light.

But in the 17th century, as bottles sealed with cork became more common, corkscrews did too. Collectors say that very early versions of the tool were derived from military kits: Soldiers used screw-shaped gun worms to pull misfired musket balls from the barrels of their guns. They would drill into the lead and drag the ammunition up and out. The first corkscrews were small and portable, often nothing more than the worm (the screw itself) and a small ring for pulling with your finger. But in the 18th century, people came to understand the benefits of aging wine, and bottles were standardized in a long-necked cylindrical shape suitable for long-term storage. The new emphasis on shelf life necessitated a better cork  and thus a better corkscrew.",2014-03-14T14:30:11+0000

Still, he asked, is the tale a credible love story? Fitzgerald himself was not sure, but Mr. Luhrmann, Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Mulligan make it an effective one. At a crucial, climactic moment  a scene in a suite at the Plaza Hotel  the director mutes his irrepressible circus ringmaster showmanship and plunges into undiluted melodrama. The music stops, and the camera cuts among the assembled faces as the emotional core of the film is laid bare. That scene, Mr. Scott added, stands out in a movie that is otherwise gaudily and grossly inauthentic, like Gatsby himself.

(TCM) THE RISING OF THE MOON (1957) Comprising three Irish tales that were filmed in Ireland with Irish actors, this movie, directed by John Ford, is about as close to the Emerald Isle as American audiences can get without leaving home this St. Patricks Day. The first vignette, The Majesty of the Law, is about a highly principled man arrested in an assault case; the second, A Minutes Wait, is a farce set on a train; and the third, which shares the films title, is based on Lady Gregorys one-act drama about an Irish patriot. All in all, Mr. Ford, who made this picture as a personal labor of love, has given us Irish characters as lushly sentimental as the songs that run through his black-and-white idyll, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. The film is one of several Irish-centric movies the channel is showing throughout the day, including The Flying Irishman (1939), at 9 a.m.; the musical My Wild Irish Rose (1947), at noon; and Finians Rainbow (1968), at 5:15 p.m. ",2014-03-17T04:17:00+0000

In November, the toy company, GoldieBlox, gained widespread attention for a video which showed girls building an elaborate Rube Goldberg device and singing a version of that song with alternate lyrics celebrating their scientific achievements. GoldieBlox filed a lawsuit against the Beastie Boys, asserting its right to use the song in its video; the band countered that the video was an advertisement that is designed to sell a product, and that it does not allow its songs to be used for such purposes. The band filed a copyright infringement suit in December. On Tuesday, a press representative for GoldieBlox said that suit had been settled, adding in a statement: That settlement includes (a) the issuance of an apology by GoldieBlox, which will be posted on GoldieBloxs website, and (b) a payment by GoldieBlox, based on a percentage of its revenues, to one or more charities selected by Beastie Boys that support science, technology, engineering and mathematics education for girls.

(IFC) BOILER ROOM (2000) Before Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio adapted the life of Jordan Belfort for the screen in The Wolf of Wall Street, Mr. Belfort inspired this fictional tale about a group of young, ruthless stockbrokers who work miles from the trading floor and use nothing but cold calls to relieve unsuspecting clients of their life savings. Giovanni Ribisi (above right, with Ben Affleck) plays Seth, a college dropout who joins the small firm of J. T. Marlin, rising quickly through its ranks, thanks to the no-nonsense tutelage of his possibly corrupt bosses and colleagues (portrayed by Mr. Affleck, Vin Diesel and Nicky Katt, among others). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that the film, written and directed by Ben Younger, reflects the sensibility of the generation it holds up to critical scrutiny, and its a cunningly ambiguous act of self-portraiture. He added that Mr. Younger presents a world ruled by a gang of lawless, soulless children, like the island of lost boys in Peter Pan.

A new Constitution and two rounds of elections did not improve the lives of ordinary Afghans; the Taliban regrouped and found increasing numbers of supporters for their guerrilla actions; by 2006, as they mounted an ambitious offensive to retake southern Afghanistan and unleashed more than a hundred suicide bombers, it was clear that a deadly and determined opponent was growing in strength, not losing it. As I toured the bomb sites and battlegrounds of the Taliban resurgence, Afghans kept telling me the same thing: The organizers of the insurgency were in Pakistan, specifically in the western district of Quetta.

Oppenheimer chose not to note that scorpions, a species almost as well known for belligerence as Homo sapiens, would sooner or later take that risk. We humans have not done so, at least not so far.

The America we inhabit now is both more socially integrated and segregated than it was in the tumultuous days in which the two men lived. A black president coexists with residential and educational patterns that are in some instances more racially separated than they were on the morning of the 1963 March on Washington. This circumstance is not entirely indicative of a failure of will. Its partly a reflection of the fact that black aspirations for equality were far more complicated than the simple Martin versus Malcolm formulation, just as each man was far more complicated than his public depiction. If those years can be understood as a sort of test, black America looked at the multiple-choice question of identity and answered yes. ",2014-03-21T15:00:04+0000

Today Moroccos medinas are much the same. The photographer Ambroise Tzenas visited medinas in the Moroccan cities of Tangier, Tetouan and Chefchaouen, which is known for its striking buildings painted bright blue.

(Cinemax) TRUE LIES (1994) Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks her husband, Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger, above, with Ms. Curtis), is a mild-mannered computer salesman, but no one is what he or she seems in this romantic action comedy written and directed by James Cameron. When she learns that Harry is actually an international spy, Helen gets pulled into a globe-saving mission to stop terrorists with nuclear bombs. The most engaging part of the film is the long middle section, which toys with marital types, Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Schwarzenegger, she added, is no Cary Grant, but along with Ms. Curtis, he makes True Lies the first successful romantic comedy in which trucks, as well as heartstrings, are blown to bits. (The movie is repeated at 10 p.m.) On Showtime 2, at 1:35 p.m., Mr. Schwarzenegger stars as John Kimble, an undercover officer in Ivan Reitmans Kindergarten Cop (1990). The search for a drug dealer leads Kimble and his partner (Pamela Reed) to an Oregon school where their suspects son is a student. Kimble ends up teaching the class of kindergartners, and though the film relies on obvious jokes, Ms. James wrote in The Times, Mr. Schwarzenegger is so appealing, relaxed and genial in this role that his fans are not likely to ask for more, and even his detractors are likely to be happily surprised. And theres one more chance for a dose of Mr. Schwarzenegger before the day ends: On The Tonight Show, at 11:34 p.m. on NBC, he will be a guest, along with the television host Carson Daly and the band Vampire Weekend.",2014-03-23T20:50:08+0000

The current outbreak in Guinea has killed 63 people, but the appearance of new cases has slowed significantly, the countrys health ministry said. Most outbreaks are thought to start when jungle hunters eat the flesh of apes that died of Ebola, presumably after eating fruit contaminated by bat feces or saliva.

Forty-one years ago, a young history professor at Cambridge named Simon Schama agreed to complete one such work, left unfinished by the great British Jewish historian Cecil Roth when he died. Schama tried to do the job, he really did, but for whatever reasons the graft wouldnt take, as he writes in the foreword of his own The Story of the Jews. Now we know why. Roth was a splendid writer with an encyclopedic knowledge of his field, and Schama is a splendid writer with an encyclopedic acquaintance with a wide range of fields. But Roth wrote history from above, chronicling the doings of great men entangled in great events, whereas Schama writes history from below, and from the middle and from other unexpected angles, resurrecting the unrecorded and long-forgotten, and analyzing the social and cultural forces that shaped his subjects lives. Roths and Schamas approaches to history are at least two generations apart, and Schamas is the more user-friendly (to this reader, anyway). Although his book, which ends in the 15th century, is destined to become part of a two-volume set big enough to prop anything open, theres nothing thudding about it. ",2014-03-28T14:48:05+0000

The book contains a lot of praise for the immense, surprisingly chatty body of Hebrew literature  but when the editors of a new anthology, Poems That Make Grown Men Cry, asked Schama what brings a tear to his eye, he settled not on any Jewish verse but on Lullaby, by the deeply (and deeply conflicted) Anglican W. H. Auden. The poem suspends time and the brutality of the world, Schama writes, at the moment of unanswerably perfect love. . . . It is the honesty embedded amidst sheets and on the pillow that makes the eyes prick and the heart knock. Its hard to fault his choice. Lullaby was written after the Nazis had come to power  as Auden puts it, fashionable madmen raise / Their pedantic boring cry  and it makes a strong case for the triumph of romance, no matter how fleeting.

This is fantastic  and it is also disarmingly recent (2005). So while its safe to say that few will be swept away by the prose in Qualifying Times, Jaime Schultz, an assistant professor of womens studies and kinesiology at Penn State University, has done a service by collecting the history of ponytails, tennis whites, tampons and other topics connected to women and sports into one volume.",2014-03-28T16:40:23+0000

us,Home to the Strange Familiar,"Teju Coles Open City was one of the most acclaimed debut novels of recent years. The story of a young African wandering the streets of New York City struck out into new territory for what might be termed immigrant fiction. We have become accustomed to a certain sort of narrative about people who come to the metropolis from the periphery. Whether set in New York, London or elsewhere, such fictions tend to present stories of striving and self-invention. We see the new immigrant struggling to make a life in an unfriendly or even hostile environment, overwhelmed by the novelty of sights and sounds, anxious about holding on to culture and tradition, filled with wonder at first-world wealth and consumption. By contrast, Coles narrator in Open City is a self-assured young cosmopolitan, an educated professional who does not ask permission to explore, describe and pass judgment. His breadth of cultural reference is not limited to the traditions of West Africa. He is a lover of Mahler and Modernist photography. He reads Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes.

Though the damming of the river would provide electricity and other conveniences across the region, there were many who were not swayed by arguments of the common good and tried to stay, even as the water rose across their fields and toward the houses. Early on in Amy Greenes aching, passionate and vivid new novel, Long Man, a character stands in the night, surveying all that will be lost to progress. She had heard about a Depression going on but saw no evidence of it herself. She didnt understand the power companys reasoning. She didnt need electric lights when she could see by the sun and moon. She had the spring and the earth to keep her food from spoiling. She had a washboard for scrubbing clean her dresses.

Its a niche of electronic music with roots in the ambient compositions of the 70s (Brian Eno famously composed the Microsoft start-up melody) that has evolved over time into a slick marketing sound as risible as advertising jingles.

The defense lawyers are seeking to show that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under the influence of his brother, who was ideologically driven and had a history of violence, and that Dzhokhar should therefore be spared the death penalty. They want the government to release the familys applications for asylum in the United States as well as documents of F.B.I. contacts with Tamerlan Tsarnaev before the bombing in which, the lawyers said, the F.B.I. asked him to be an informant on the Chechen and Muslim communities.

That is, until he finds out that a vagrant he gave a lift to years earlier was the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, who has left him $150 million in his will. The film, directed by Jonathan Demme, is based on the true story of a Utah gas station attendant who claimed to be a beneficiary of Hughess fortune in what came to be known as the Mormon will. Officials deemed the Mormon will a forgery, but Mr. Demme and Bo Goldman, his screenwriter, take Melvins tale at face value and present the movie as Melvins wildest dream, Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. The comic catch is that this wild dream is essentially so prosaic. Its also touched with pathos since Melvin  in spite of himself  knows that it will never be realized.

It was stable and relatively virtuous and soon to be known for having resisted the temptation to make bad subprime loans to Americans or peddle them to ignorant investors. But its management didnt understand just what an afterthought the bank was  on the rare occasions American financiers thought about it at all. Katsuyamas bosses sent him to New York from Toronto in 2002, when he was 23, as part of a big push for the bank to become a player on Wall Street. The sad truth was that hardly anyone noticed it. The people in Canada are always saying, Were paying too much for people in the United States,  Katsuyama says.
