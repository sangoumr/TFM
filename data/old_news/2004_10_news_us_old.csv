If the proposed change in the civil code is approved by Parliament, which is expected, Spain will become the third country in Europe, after the Netherlands and Belgium, to fully legalize gay marriages. Several other European nations have adopted lesser versions, like civil-union contracts. The move underscores the loss of influence in the country by the Roman Catholic Church, which issued harsh public criticism of the proposal this week. A recent opinion poll said that 62 percent of those questioned supported equal rights for all couples, though some did not want to use the word marriage for gay unions.

The partners, counsel, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our esteemed senior partner and former chairman Edward Silver. Having joined Proskauer as a young associate in 1948, after graduating from Cornell Law School, where he was the managing editor of the Cornell Law Review, Ed set his sights on labor-management relations from the very start, and went on to enjoy a 40-year career as one of the country's preeminent labor lawyers. Ed represented some of the nation's largest employers, serving a wide range of clients in almost every industry, including telecommunications, broadcasting, publishing, transportation, health care, brewing, maritime, and insurance. Although Ed was a ""management - side"" labor lawyer and a skilled and successful negotiator, he enjoyed the respect, if not admiration, of those on the ""other side of the table"" because of his fairness, decency and unswerving integrity--qualities that he prized above all others. Ed was a key figure in the labor affairs of New York City and was appointed by three mayors as a City representative to the Board of Collective Bargaining. He also served as special labor counsel to the City and participated for twenty years in negotiations representing municipal employees. Ed also served as Arbitrator in the settlement of outstanding issues in the 1983 Metro North strike. Noting his important role in New York City labor relations, The New York Times applauded Ed for his ""tough, fair bargaining"" and referred to him as a ""muchneeded pro."" Ed's leadership and sense of fairness and decency also served Proskauer well. As Chairman of the Firm until 1991, Ed helped to change the Firm's management style by bridging the generations. A visionary and true pioneer, Ed was also instrumental in the Firm's 1990 move to Manhattan's West Side. Ed was a Director and Member of the Executive Committee of the American Arbitration Association; a Member of the New York City Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform and a Director of the Citizens Budget Commission. Ed served on the Labor Committees of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the American Bar Association and the New York Country Lawyers' Association. A life-long champion of the underdog, Ed received the Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee in 1984 and the 1988 B'nai B'rith International Distinguished Achievement Award. In 1989, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Hofstra University.

The plan is to see three performers this evening, and the complication that two of them will be appearing on different stages at the same time only adds the spice of challenge. We reach our seats in Zankel Hall, a newly built, smallish, ultramodern performance space, just as Audra McDonald takes the stage. She's a singer who moves easily between musicals and serious classical soprano roles, and tonight she's in a slinky black gown, accompanied by a six-piece band, to perform ""The Seven Deadly Sins,"" a set of Broadway-style songs, each one written by a different prominent composer-lyricist team. The music is witty, sultry and poised, with McDonald seated on a stool torch-singer-style, chatting and joking between songs with her no-less-elegantly attired audience. We stay for the first five sins, then duck out after Sloth and vault up the staircase to find that the stately and storied main hall has come undone, 2,800 people rocking, conga lines going up and down the aisles. David Byrne is onstage, backed by a rock band and a full string section. The former Talking Heads singer and longtime impresario of eclectic pop is dressed all in brown with white shoes, and the music moves from Talking Heads' nervous anthem ""Psycho Killer"" to an aria from ""La Traviata"" that he introduces by saying, ""This is a song by an Italian songwriter, Giuseppe Verdi.""",2004-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,'Essential Shakespeare Handbook': A Bard Compendium,"Despite a graphic design that calls to mind a middle-school World Cultures textbook, the ""Essential Shakespeare Handbook"" (DK, $25) deserves a place next to your edition of Shakespeare's plays. Leslie Dunton-Downer, a former lecturer at Harvard, and Alan Riding, the European cultural correspondent for The Times, have written a guide to the poems and plays that is scholarly without being recondite, succinct without being superficial. Its ideal use would be as a warm-up before attending a performance. The authors carefully outline plots and break out important lines and speeches, and explain period imagery and language. (Indeed, the tyro might soon be able to pull off a few Shakespearean ""pre-laughs"" -- in which eager, or pretentious, audience members chuckle in anticipation of the pun they know is coming.) Yet the book also rewards extended reading. There are excellent sidebars on topics like heckling (Elizabethans tossed cabbages, at French kings and actors alike), and random fun facts (the cannon shot at the end of ""Henry VIII"" in 1613 burned down the Globe). Ultimately, the book's graphic scheme celebrates the free-for-all of the Shakespearean universe: the performances -- whether by John Gielgud, Paul Robeson or Keanu Reeves -- and the interpretations, from Orson Welles's voodoo ""Macbeth"" in Harlem to Akira Kurosawa's, set in medieval Japan (""Throne of Blood""). Should one attempt a complete front-to-back reading, the result would be a thorough grounding in Shakespeare's work and an enlarged astonishment at the range of his imagination.

us,My Bohemia,"In Elizabeth Peyton's portraits you are as likely to come across Oscar Wilde or a teenage Queen Elizabeth II as you are Peyton's fellow artists. Born in Danbury, Conn., in 1965, Peyton began painting as a teenager and spent her early career developing her style in near obscurity. But things began to change for Peyton with a solo show in 1993, mounted by her dealer, Gavin Brown, in a room at the Chelsea Hotel. Since then, her work has been in exhibitions across the globe, including the Whitney Biennial last spring. Peyton generally works from photos culled from books and magazines, as well as from her own snapshots. But the facts are there only so that she may seduce them into a more compelling vision -- as in these five recent portraits. The picture at right lifts a pallid Keith Richards from the opening frames of the 1970 film ""Gimme Shelter."" Here, also, are two New York artists, Peyton's close friend Jonathan Horowitz and Nick Mauss. In another portrait, Peyton's dog, Harry, nestles with Richard Prince, an artist better known for the swagger of his own work (images of Marlboro men and biker-mag centerfolds) than as a contemplative afternoon visitor. If the delicate pencil drawing of Walt Whitman -- based on a photograph of the young poet -- seems an anachronism, it couldn't be less so. ""I'd been thinking about Whitman being a free spirit in a very conservative time,"" Peyton says. ""How subversive that was.""",2004-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SILVER, EDWARD","SILVER--Edward. The partners, counsel, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our esteemed senior partner and former chairman Edward Silver. Having joined Proskauer as a young associate in 1948, after graduating from Cornell Law School, where he was the managing editor of the Cornell Law Review, Ed set his sights on labor-management relations from the very start, and went on to enjoy a 40-year career as one of the country's preeminent labor lawyers. Ed represented some of the nation's largest employers, serving a wide range of clients in almost every industry, including telecommunications, broadcasting, publishing, transportation, health care, brewing, maritime, and insurance. Although Ed was a ""management - side"" labor lawyer and a skilled and successful negotiator, he enjoyed the respect, if not admiration, of those on the ""other side of the table"" because of his fairness, decency and unswerving integrity--qualities that he prized above all others. Ed was a key figure in the labor affairs of New York City and was appointed by three mayors as a City representative to the Board of Collective Bargaining. He also served as special labor counsel to the City and participated for twenty years in negotiations representing municipal employees. Ed also served as Arbitrator in the settlement of outstanding issues in the 1983 Metro North strike. Noting his important role in New York City labor relations, The New York Times applauded Ed for his ""tough, fair bargaining"" and referred to him as a ""muchneeded pro."" Ed's leadership and sense of fairness and decency also served Proskauer well. As Chairman of the Firm until 1991, Ed helped to change the Firm's management style by bridging the generations. A visionary and true pioneer, Ed was also instrumental in the Firm's 1990 move to Manhattan's West Side. Ed was a Director and Member of the Executive Committee of the American Arbitration Association; a Member of the New York City Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform and a Director of the Citizens Budget Commission. Ed served on the Labor Committees of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, the American Bar Association and the New York Country Lawyers' Association. A life-long champion of the underdog, Ed received the Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award from the American Jewish Committee in 1984 and the 1988 B'nai B'rith International Distinguished Achievement Award. In 1989, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Hofstra University. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Marlys, children Ann, Eric, Owen and Adam; grandson Elijah and all his family and friends. Alan S. Jaffe Chairman Proskauer Rose LLP SILVER--Edward. The National Basketball Association is deeply saddened by the loss of Edward Silver, beloved father of our colleague Adam Silver. Loving husband of Marlys Silver and devoted father of Ann, Erik, Owen and Adam, he was preceded in death earlier this year by his first wife and mother of his four children, Melba Silver. Edward Silver will be remembered as one of the nation's leading labor lawyers and as the former Chairman of Proskauer Rose, one of the country's most prominent law firms. Over the span of 48 years with Proskauer Rose, Ed counseled his clients, including the NBA, with wisdom, integrity and devotion. All the members of the NBA Family send their heartfelt condolences to Adam and his family. A service to celebrate the life of Edward Silver will be held in New York at the Museum of Natural History on Thursday, October 7, at 10:30 AM. The entrance is on Columbus Avenue at 79th Street.

Quotidian life was of limited interest to Chinese scholars; the culture valued the extraordinary rather than the representative, and meaning was found at the center of the society rather than at its periphery. But the last hundred years or so have seen a shift. Though the study of Chinese art still focuses on court life, it has broadened to include the lives of ordinary citizens. These revisions largely come from archaeology of the last hundred years, and particularly of the last three decades. ""If excavations simply confirmed what we know of early China,"" said Alfreda Murck, an independent scholar based in Beijing, ""we would all have an easier time. But they don't. Archaeology has upset and confounded the traditional linear narrative with discoveries that no one could have anticipated. What we call China is revealed as a complex world more culturally diverse, more multiethnic than previously imagined.

For publishers, and for their accountants, this was happy news. For the editors of this journal, on the other hand, the list has sometimes seemed to provide little more than seven decades' worth of mild indigestion, delivered in weekly doses.

The most extraordinary man with a lifetime of achievements. Most important to him was the joy and bond he brought to and received from his family. His impact on the many generations from peers to grandchildren is measured by the vacuum his absence has already created. Beyond family, his passions were the law which he loved, business where he succeeded, charity work to help those who could not help themselves and thoroughbred horses which he bred and raised. He passed the New York State Bar at age 20 and was admitted when he turned 21, an achievement made possible by his rare talent. While waiting to be admitted he successfully tutored others, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. Soon after he became involved in the then newly created United Nations and worked with Trygvie Lie, the first Secretary-General. Active in politics he was a charter member of the Young Liberals of Brooklyn and was a speechwriter for Eleanor Roosevelt. Later in life he sponsored one of the first fund raisers for Walter Mondale's Presidential campaign. As a result of religious prejudice he exited the legal profession early in his career and went on to a successful 20 years in business. He then returned to law, his love, and was the founding partner of the law firm that became Stein, Davidoff and Malito. He had been in private practice for the last 15 years. His charitable work included serving as President of the United Neighborhood Centers of America (UNCA), working with Arthur Ashe in establishing tennis training centers for underprivileged children and serving on President Eisenhower's National Physical Fitness Committee as well as with the Young Men's Philanthropic League.

Mr. Hemingway, speaking in a telephone interview from his home in Bozeman, Mont., said the five-page story and a related two-page letter constituted a single letter that should be included in a huge collection of Ernest Hemingway's letters being assembled at Penn State University. Referring to the power of the custodians of the Hemingway estate to block the story's appearance, he said: ""The reason that we withheld permission for publication is that we want people to cooperate with this project. We want them to make any letter they have available to this study."" Describing the story, ""My Life in the Bull Ring With Donald Ogden Stewart,"" recounting an incident in Pamplona, Spain in 1924, as a ""lightly written humorous piece"" that ""really adds nothing about Ernest Hemingway,"" he added, ""It's part of the canon of Ernest Hemingway under the subheading: letters to friends."" The documents were found last year by Donald Stewart, the son of DONALD OGDEN STEWART, a well-known writer and friend of Hemingway in the 1920's.

Nintendo, the Kyoto-based maker of Game Boy portable game machines, also raised its forecast for net profit for the year ending March 2005 to 84 billion yen from a previous forecast of 70 billion yen. The company is benefiting from a decline in the yen against the dollar and euro, which is bolstering the value of its foreign-currency-denominated assets. However, after cutting the price of its Game Boy Advance consoles, Nintendo said it expected revenue to have declined by 12.5 percent to 185 billion yen for the half year, from 211.4 billion yen a year earlier.

Mr. Bouziane quickly won a court suspension of the expulsion and returned to France. Yesterday, the country's top administrative court overturned the suspension, allowing the government to proceed again.

The proposal for a new formula was packaged as an amendment to a larger bill making its way through the Senate that would adopt many of the security measures recommended by the 9/11 commission. The larger bill is expected to be voted on later this week. The way the federal government now apportions antiterrorism dollars has been criticized as another way for lawmakers to funnel money back to their own districts in pork-barrel fashion.

The regulation, Section 145 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, obligates airlines to accommodate, at a round-trip fee of no more than $50, passengers holding tickets on an airline that stops flying because of liquidation or other bankruptcy-related causes. Passengers ""should be provided protection against airline failures when, as taxpayers, they recently provided airlines with billions of dollars"" in loans, grants and other post-9/11 relief, said Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition.

He particularly enjoyed serving on building committees and took great pride in his contributions to the development of new Jewish day schools and temples. His interest in disabled children led to the founding of Camp Sunshine in Ridgewood, NJ, and the development of the Children's Therapy Center in Fair Lawn, NJ. Harris was an avid fisherman and a lively companion on numerous fishing expeditions with his friends and family. Married for 53 years, he was an adoring husband to Shirley Shapiro, a loving father to his children, Elaine Appellof and Jerry Saunders, Beth and Jim Steele, and Diane and Bari Shamas, and a doting grandfather to Rachel, Ellie, Sara, Jake, Emily, Irene and Raphi.

After several years working as an engineer for Curtiss-Wright Co., he found his true calling in the real estate business. With his colleagues, Ralph Kern, Arnold Midlarsky and Ashley Hoffman, he developed and managed residential properties in New York and New Jersey.

His interest in disabled children led to the founding of Camp Sunshine in Ridgewood, NJ, and the development of the Children's Therapy Center in Fair Lawn, NJ. Harris was an avid fisherman and a lively companion on numerous fishing expeditions with his friends and family. Married for 53 years, he was an adoring husband to Shirley Shapiro, a loving father to his children, Elaine Appellof and Jerry Saunders, Beth and Jim Steele, and Diane and Bari Shamas, and a doting grandfather to Rachel, Ellie, Sara, Jake, Emily, Irene and Raphi.

The installation, by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, is causing the same furor there that a similar work did in the spring in Milan, where a father became so infuriated by its effect on his child that he fell off a ladder trying to cut it down. In Seville, the Andalusian government sent a letter to the biennial's organizers asking them to consider removing Mr. Cattelan's work because it might upset children, said a regional government spokesman, Alison Maia. The biennial commissioners refused. At a news conference, the curator, Harald Szeemann, said the hanged child mannequin was a self-portrait of the artist, and Juana de Aizpuru, the director of the biennial, said the work denounced children's suffering around the world.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SHAPIRO, HARRIS LEE","SHAPIRO--Harris Lee. Dearly loved husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, cousin and friend. Died October 5th after a long illness. Born in Chicago, he grew up in Brooklyn, graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School and with an engineering degree from City College of New York. After several years working as an engineer for Curtiss-Wright Co., he found his true calling in the real estate business. With his colleagues, Ralph Kern, Arnold Midlarsky and Ashley Hoffman, he developed and managed residential properties in New York and New Jersey. A confident visionary and devoted philanthropist, he gave generously of his time and resources to a multitude of organizations. He served on many boards including the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Solomon Schechter Day School of New Milford, NJ, Solomon Schechter High School of Teaneck, NJ, Temple Emanu-El in Closter, NJ, the Tenafly Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Bergen County Cerebral Palsy League and the Jewish Home for the Elderly in Rockleigh, NJ. He particularly enjoyed serving on building committees and took great pride in his contributions to the development of new Jewish day schools and temples. His interest in disabled children led to the founding of Camp Sunshine in Ridgewood, NJ, and the development of the Children's Therapy Center in Fair Lawn, NJ. Harris was an avid fisherman and a lively companion on numerous fishing expeditions with his friends and family. Married for 53 years, he was an adoring husband to Shirley Shapiro, a loving father to his children, Elaine Appellof and Jerry Saunders, Beth and Jim Steele, and Diane and Bari Shamas, and a doting grandfather to Rachel, Ellie, Sara, Jake, Emily, Irene and Raphi. He was a devoted brother to Sylvia and Austin Fried, and brother-in-law to Lee and Ralph Kern, and a cherished uncle to all of their children and grandchildren. We will all miss his wise counsel, his kind and giving disposition, and his endless love. Funeral was held on Wednesday, October 6th. The family would appreciate donations to the Children's Therapy Center, 29-01 Berkshire Rd., Fair Lawn, NJ 07410 or to a charity of your choice. SHAPIRO--Harris. We have dreaded this day, but we must satisfy an overwhelming need to recount a small snapshot of our love and admiration for Harris L. Shapiro. In spite of enormous hardships, Harris Shapiro, with the help of his beloved wife Shirley and a loving family led a wonderful life of accomplishment and we all know of his extraordinary achievements. In the face of continuing adversity, they maintained a successful, emotional balance, discharged taxing familial obligations beyond any kind of reasonable expectations and still have the energy and emotional strength to voluntarily contribute both time and money to charity to the broader community at large. Harris had an extraordinary temperament, always ready for compromise and reasoned and good judgment. But perhaps the best achievement of all is that they had managed to be there for each other, and we see the sad day as a testament of their extraordinarily successful relationship. I would draw an analogy to sports, where the end game can become the most important part of a successful afternoon. And the longer the end game goes on, the harder it gets. As you grow older, and perhaps your prosperity increases, however your horizons and physical prowess diminish, and it is precisely at that point that it takes the most courage and fortitude to cherish your partner and maintain your successful relationships. Lee and I are in awe of the great Shapiro achievements and can still appreciate and admire their profound ability to make those enduring achievements happen. We profoundly mourn the untimely death of our dear Brother-in-Law, Friend and Partner. His untimely, but post Yom Kippur/ pre Hashanah Rabba (h) passing is evidence of his peace with the world. Harris' loving exuberance remains strong in our hearts and minds. We are confident, but nevertheless pray, that he will encounter a kinder and gentler providence, and extend our most sincere love and sympathy to his beloved dear wife Shirley, all of his beloved children and grandchildren, all of which he held so dear.

Burnside. Growing up in Hernando, Miss., the Dickinson brothers soaked up Southern rock and blues, had a youthful flirtation with punk and delved into the rangy, asymmetrical blues of the north Mississippi hill country. At the Bonnaroo festival in June, in a set just released as a CD and DVD, the Allstars brought along some Mississippi neighbors who will also join them in New York: the Rising Star Fife and Drum Band. They are heirs to a Mississippi tradition that dates back at least a century: a bluesification of military fife-and-drum groups that swings the drumbeat and trades marches for African-tinged melodies. The bill also includes the Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans, which started a brass-band renaissance by adding funk and jazz to the classic street parade music. Collaborations are likely, reshuffling Southern geography to maximize the party. (Tomorrow night at 8, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800.

us,MATTHEW POLENZANI,"When the Metropolitan Opera unveils its new production of Mozart's ""Zauberflte"" tonight, most of the attention, no doubt, will be on Julie Taymor's production. But the evening also represents a milestone for the tenor Matthew Polenzani, who sings Prince Tamino, the confused and questing youth who becomes so adept on the magic flute. This will be the boyish 36-year-old tenor's first starring role in a new Met production, which represents quite a leap from his 1997 debut: he portrayed a boyar in ""Boris Godunov"" and sang four words near the end of that long Russian opera. Mr. Polenzani, who grew up in the Chicago area, was lead singer in a high school rock band called Empty Pockets and did not set his sights on opera until late in college, has built his career the old-fashioned way: step by step, with increasingly larger roles. In recent seasons he won acclaim for an endearing and sweetly sung portrayal of David, the apprentice shoemaker, in Wagner's ""Meistersinger,"" and as Iopas, a court poet in Berlioz's epic ""Les Troyens."" Last season when the cast changed in the new Met production of ""Don Giovanni,"" Mr. Polenzani took over the role of Don Ottavio. Now he is the star. With his warm voice and youthful energy he should be an affecting Tamino. His many Met fans will be rooting him on. (Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets $50 to $250.)

During the investigation, informants and undercover officers bought 19 firearms, including an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, and about half a pound of crack cocaine, which has a street value of up to $6,000, federal prosecutors said. Many defendants had prior felony convictions and were on parole, officials said. The investigation began with a focus on the Bloods gang in Westchester County, but the authorities would not say yesterday whether the defendants had gang affiliations or were part of the same trafficking operation.

us,SIGOURNEY WEAVER,"On screen, Sigourney Weaver has never been much of one for saying she was sorry. Her rsum of roles is heavy on women less likely to sit back and sigh over regrets than to wrestle with nasty space creatures or romp with gorillas. So it was a jolt when Ms. Weaver, wearing country club pastels and a blush of demureness, tiptoed onto the stage of a tiny theater in TriBeCa last spring in a fluttery breeze of apologies. Portraying the title character in ""Mrs. Farnsworth,"" A. R. Gurney's genteelly subversive comedy about a Connecticut matron with an explosive political secret, Ms. Weaver quickly made it clear that she could render passive, polite and penitent just as appealingly as she embodied active and Amazonian in the movies. Now she has returned to the Flea Theater to assert her ownership of the most captivating portrait in Mr. Gurney's gallery of WASP heroines of bad faith and good manners. Directed by her husband, Jim Simpson, Ms. Weaver flirts slyly with caricature only to lead you into unexpected backroads of character. By the way, Mrs. Farnsworth's secret has something to do with a man of power named George. It is presumably no coincidence that Ms. Weaver steps back into the play (through Nov. 6) for the month before the presidential elections (1:30). (This weekend's schedule: tonight at 7 and tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Tickets: $50 to $60.) BEN BRANTLEY",2004-10-08T05:00:00+0000

The pipeline would stretch 2,000 miles from the remote highlands of Papua New Guinea south to Brisbane. Since 1996, Chevron, and now Exxon Mobil, have planned to build the pipeline but have had trouble signing customers who fear that instability in Papua New Guinea could disrupt supplies.

The I.M.F. recently considered expelling Zimbabwe because of its failure to pay its debt, but a statement on the fund's Web site stated that the decision to close the Harare office was made to use its resources more efficiently.

The intense, unexpressed emotions that percolate through Ms. Martel's story of innocence and desire are conveyed, more than in most films, through sounds -- whispered and half-overhead conversations, the murmurings of water in old pipes, the strange auditory signals that float in from the edges of perception. Her visual style is similarly oblique, as she frames her characters through half-opened doors, at odd angles and in asymmetrical close-ups. To a degree that is sometimes disorienting, Ms. Martel explores the mysteries of the senses.

Before that I had been partying for about -- well, I'll be 60 on the 4th of July, so you do the math. Still, I felt as if somebody had hit me in the head with a baseball bat. I took the test results back home to Hayward, Calif., and gave them to my doctor at the V.A. clinic. He treated me for H.I.V. for the next seven and a half years.",2004-10-10T05:00:00+0000

She was wearing jeans, a tight striped T-shirt and a little silver bear around her neck. Danes has lovely, expressive hands that she uses while she talks. One usually hovers close to her face, like a graceful bird. ""I was a very confident child,"" Danes continued. ""I knew I wanted to be an actress from the age of 5. Madonna was my original muse -- around 5, I saw her perform on TV, and I realized that performing could be one's vocation. Then, at 7 or 8, I realized that most actors don't make a lot of money, and I amended my plan. But at 9, I seized my destiny. I made a formal announcement to my parents that I had to be true to my art. Money or no money, acting is my calling."" For intentional comic emphasis, Danes, who is 25, tossed her shoulder-length blond hair back in a theatrical whoosh. ""That kind of self-consciousness seemed natural to me then, but how, I wonder. I think I'm regressing. Now I am much more insecure about my work.""",2004-10-10T05:00:00+0000

We deeply regret the loss of this most vibrant woman, who was born to a Viennese stage actress, Alice von Herdan, and an anti-Hitler revolutionary, Karl Frank, on June 13, 1924, in Munich. At a young age, Michaela Maria Magdalena Agatha Frank graced the cover of a leading Austrian magazine that extolled her looks as a quintessential Austrian beauty. Schooled in Salzburg, and raised by her mother and stepfather, Carl Zuckmayer, German screenwriter of ""The Blue Angel"" and a prominent playwright, Michaela began a journey that would take her to boarding school in England, then, at 16, across the Atlantic with the help of Ingrid Warburg of the Italian banking family, to America at the outbreak of WWII, and to New York City. There, she found not only refuge -- with her parents' friends, writers Sinclair Lewis and Dorothy Thompson--but also a true home. Graduating from Sarah Lawrence in 1945, she was a journalist for the Washington Post and married a Pentagon Intelligence Officer, Harold Weston. In New York City, she raised two sons and a daughter, played tennis tournaments in Central Park, and zealously followed the New York Mets. Her husband, a labor attorney, and she moved the family to Hastings-on-Hudson, where she continued to win tennis tournaments at the Euclid Tennis Club and became a much-revered counselor of women afflicted by alcoholism. She was, morever, a Mets devotee, Clintonite, tennis star, gardener, and beloved friend to all who knew her.

Elizabeth Marvel, 34, plays her not as a hysterical manipulator but as a largely passive creature of instinct, floating around the nearly bare stage in a tiny slip and becoming ever more monotonic as her universe constricts. In the final minutes, she is utterly defenseless, going slack as John Douglas Thompson's contemptuous Judge Brack dribbles V-8 juice over her head. Ms. Marvel has experience with Mr. van Hove's theatrical plumbing: she was the bathtub-bound Blanche in his similarly deconstructionist 1999 production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Then she spent four years as a detective on the TV show ""The District,"" a job she says allowed her to read the great books of the Western canon. During rehearsals of ""Hedda,"" she married her sweetheart of 14 years, the actor Bill Camp, and the day after opening won a part in the Atlantic Theater Company's production of Woody Allen's play ""A Second Hand Memory,"" about which she's sworn to secrecy.

us,The Leading Candidates in a Crowded Pop Field,"THE furiously contested 2004 election has had an unexpected artistic bonus: more political songs than any election since the dawn of rock 'n' roll, and more openly partisan songs than anyone might expect. In the protest-song heyday of the 1960's, songwriters devoted themselves to denouncing specific injustices and vaguely yearning for peace. This year, folkies and punks, rappers and indie rockers are taking sides and dusting off their rebel credentials by bluntly savaging the Bush administration. The pop polls are completely one-sided: although there were both pro-war and antiwar songs around the Iraq invasion, not one high-profile song currently supports the president. The music may make a political difference -- the six Vote for Change tours that converge for a concert in Washington on Monday are betting that it will -- or it may simply vent or preach to the converted. But rage and frustration are always fine catalysts for music, and at a time when self-absorption rules both rock and hip-hop, politics can provide a wider perspective, one that might even last beyond the current election.

Many young people are forced to bribe professors and university officials to gain admittance. Wouldn't I contribute to a corrupt system by helping my friend bribe his way into the university? Katie Boyle, Claremont, Calif. You would do well to help your friend. He is a victim of extortion, not a perpetrator; I'm sure he would prefer not to pay a bribe to get into school. It would be different if he were the one extracting bribes. You should not help a corrupt admissions officer, but neither should you be reluctant to help your friend cope with dire circumstances.

us,'The Double',"THE MAN WHO HAS JUST COME INTO THE SHOP TO RENT A video bearson his identity card a most unusual name, a name with aclassical flavor that time has staled, neither more nor lessthan Tertuliano MAximo Afonso. The MAximo and the Afonso,which are in more common usage, he can just about tolerate,depending, of course, on the mood he's in, but the Tertulianoweighs on him like a gravestone and has done ever since hefirst realized that the wretched name lent itself to beingspoken in an ironic, potentially offensive tone. He is ahistory teacher at a secondary school, and a colleague hadsuggested the video to him with the warning, It's not exactlya masterpiece of cinema, but it might keep you amused for anhour and a half. Tertuliano MAximo Afonso is greatly in needof stimuli to distract him, he lives alone and gets bored, or,to speak with the clinical exactitude that the present dayrequires, he has succumbed to the temporary weakness of spiritordinarily known as depression. To get a clear idea of hissituation, suffice it to say that he was married but can nolonger remember what led him into matrimony, that he isdivorced and cannot now bring himself to ponder the reasonsfor the separation. On the other hand, while the ill-fatedunion produced no children who are now demanding to be handed,gratis, the world on a silver platter, he has, for some time,viewed sweet History, the serious, educational subject whichhe had felt called upon to teach and which could have been asoothing refuge for him, as a chore without meaning and abeginning without an end. For those of a nostalgictemperament, who tend to be fragile and somewhat inflexible,living alone is the harshest of punishments, but, it must besaid, such a situation, however painful, only rarely developsinto a cataclysmic drama of the kind to make the skin prickand the hair stand on end. What one mostly sees, indeed ithardly comes as a surprise anymore, are people patientlysubmitting to solitude's meticulous scrutiny, recent publicexamples, though not particularly well known and two of whomeven met with a happy ending, being the portrait painter whomwe only ever knew by his first initial, the GP who returnedfrom exile to die in the arms of the beloved fatherland, theproofreader who drove out a truth in order to plant a lie inits place, the lowly clerk in the Central Registry Office whomade off with certain death certificates, all of these, eitherby chance or coincidence, were members of the male sex, butnone of them had the misfortune to be called Tertuliano, andthis was doubtless an inestimable advantage to them in theirrelations with other people. The shop assistant, who hadalready taken down from the shelf the video requested, enteredin the log book the title of the film and the day's date, thenindicated to the customer the place where he should sign.Written after a moment's hesitation, the signature revealedonly the last two names, MAximo Afonso, without theTertuliano, but like someone determined to clarify in advancesomething that might become a cause of controversy, thecustomer murmured as he signed his name, It's quicker likethat. This precautionary explanation proved of little use, forthe assistant, as he transferred the information from thecustomer's ID onto an index card, pronounced the unfortunate,antiquated name out loud, in a tone that even an innocentchild would have recognized as deliberate. No one, we believe,however free of obstacles his or her life may have been, woulddare to claim that they had never suffered some similarhumiliation. Although, sooner or later, we will all,inevitably, be confronted by one of those hearty types to whomhuman frailty, especially in its most refined and delicateforms, is the cause of mocking laughter, the truth is that theinarticulate sounds which, quite against our wishes,occasionally emerge from our own mouth, are merely theirrepressible moans from some ancient pain or sorrow, like ascar suddenly making its forgotten presence felt again. As heputs the video away in his battered, teacher's briefcase,Tertuliano MAximo Afonso, with admirable brio, struggles notto reveal the displeasure provoked by the shop assistant'sgratuitous sneer, but he cannot help thinking, all the whilescolding himself for the vile injustice of the thought, thatthe fault lay with his colleague and with the mania certainpeople have for handing out unasked-for advice. Such is ourneed to shower blame on some distant entity when it is we wholack the courage to face up to what is there before us.Tertuliano MAximo Afonso does not know, cannot imagine or evenguess that the assistant already regrets his grossimpertinence, indeed, another ear, more finely tuned than hisand capable of dissecting the subtle vocal gradations in theassistant's At your service, sir, offered in response to thebrusque Good afternoon thrown back at him, would have told himthat a great desire for peace had installed itself behind thecounter. After all, it is a benevolent commercial principle,laid down in antiquity and tried and tested over thecenturies, that the customer is always right, even in theunlikely, but quite possible, eventuality that the customer'sname should be Tertuliano.",2004-10-10T05:00:00+0000

Such mundane objects as a cafeteria chair, an ashtray, a bathroom faucet and a shower head all exude a timeless simplicity and purity of form. Jacobsen was clearly a stickler for quality and would have decried our current obsessive desire for the next big thing. This ashtray is part of the Cylinda-Line of stainless-steel accessories designed by the pipe-smoking Jacobsen for Stelton around 1967. Inside its cylindrical container, a swiveling bowl is suspended on two slim steel rods. Swizzle the longer rod, and the bowl smoothly turns over, removing its malodorous contents from view.

Mattel plans to use the new storage technology for its ""Juice Box"" personal media player, designed to provide digital audio and video entertainment to children between the ages of 8 and 12. Matrix, which has long delayed the entry of the promising new storage technology, is delivering a 64-megabyte model. The chip technology is intended to be cheaper than rival storage systems because it involves stacking transistors on top of each other to gain higher density and lower manufacturing cost. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., must compete against companies like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices that currently manufacture nonvolatile memory chips known as flash memory. The chips are extensively used in digital cameras and cellular telephones. John Markoff (NYT)",2004-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Industrial production has risen a cumulative 8.8 percent in the first eight months of the year, fueled by booming exports and an increase in domestic demand as Brazil's economic recovery gains steam. Production of durable consumer goods and capital goods led the surge again in August, with automakers and machinery and equipment manufacturers raising output from a year ago by 45.6 percent and 30.5 percent, respectively. Most economists now expect the Brazilian economy, South America's largest, to expand about 4.5 percent this year, up from initial growth forecasts of 3.5 percent.

The plan to hold municipal elections is widely viewed as a response to popular discontent that has spawned a run of terrorist attacks over the last 17 months. The original election announcement did not explicitly say whether women would be allowed to run for office, or to vote. Several women have said they wanted to be candidates, but last month the government said that would not be allowed. Prince Nayaf's statement appears to rule out allowing women to vote as well.

The ruling was made by the Moscow Arbitration Court on a request from Yukos seeking to drop the fines. The court said the fines remained part of the total judgment owed to the government for that year, the Interfax news agency reported. Yukos faces total back-tax claims of about $7.5 billion for the years 2000 and 2001, but has almost fully repaid the $3.4 billion for 2000. The company has warned repeatedly that its production could falter and it could face bankruptcy as a result of what it says is a government campaign against it. Lawyers for Yukos said they would appeal the ruling. Erin E. Arvedlund (NYT)",2004-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Sinclair officials said that they were planning to show the documentary, ""Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal,"" on all 62 Sinclair stations within the next week or so, without commercials and in many cases in prime time. The documentary contains accusations from veterans that Mr. Kerry's 1971 testimony, in which he spoke of American atrocities during the Vietnam War, prolonged their torture when they were prisoners of war and left them demoralized. Sinclair said it was seeking to balance the documentary by inviting Mr. Kerry to appear on its stations and address the charges, an invitation his campaign has declined.

us,The Key to Survival,"THE KEY TO SURVIVAL -- Soaring oil prices, a bane for the already staggering airline industry, are likely to be a boon for aircraft manufacturers who are producing new fuel-efficient planes. That is the opinion of Michael Boyd, chairman of the Boyd Group, an aviation forecasting company whose annual two-day industry outlook conference opened in Denver yesterday. Having pared costs nearly as much as possible, ""the big job airlines have to do to survive is to reduce fuel consumption,"" Mr. Boyd said. ""New fuel-efficient airliners will be a survival necessity."" Embraer's fuel-efficient line of regional jets with 80 to 150 seats stands to gain popularity at the expense of smaller regional jets with 50 or fewer seats, he said. Boeing's existing 737-600 line and the 7E7 long-range jet it is developing should also fare well, he said. In its annual fleet forecast, the Boyd Group projected that 1,000 7E7's could eventually be sold, while demand for wide-body aircraft will continue to wane. At the same conference, Ray Neidl, an airline analyst with Calyon Securities, predicted that oil prices were accelerating the timetable for major changes in the industry. Most of the network airlines ""are trading close to bankruptcy levels, so the markets are trying to tell us something,"" he said. If oil prices remain high and airlines cannot raise fares because of fierce competition, mergers and liquidations could whittle the number of network airlines to just three within two years, from six today, he said.",2004-10-12T05:00:00+0000

The cause of death was complications from diabetes and asthma. For nearly 60 years, Ray Ross was a wellknown and widely admired figure in the New York downtown music scene. His intimate photographs document the flowering of Jazz, as he was one of the few to chronicle the transition from the big band sound of Duke Ellington to the Bebop era ushered in by John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His lifelong involvement with the downtown community kept him engaged with the avantgarde music and dance world he loved so dearly. He leaves behind over 20,000 photographs and a large community of artists, musicians and friends who know that Ray's adventurous spirit lives on in their own work. Born in New York City on February 10, 1924, Ray is survived by his friend and companion for many years Ellen Christi. His nephews David A. Ross of New York City, Mark R. Ross of Los Angeles, and Robert B. Ross of San Francisco will remember Ray as a man committed to his passion for music and photography.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   MILLS, DR. KENNETH GEORGE","MILLS--Dr. Kenneth George, peacefully passed away on the morning of October 8th, 2004. Since 1976, Dr. Mills resided in Palgrave, Ontario, Canada. Born in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, Kenneth G. Mills attended Mount Allison University and pursued a successful career as a concert pianist, and for 25 years as a teacher and adjudicator. His lifelong quest for answers to the eternal questions of life revealed to him extraordinary innate abilities of speech and artistic expression. He will be remembered most for his 50,000 recorded hours of spontaneous philosophical lectures called Unfoldments, a vast selection of which can be found in his 13 books and over 30 CDs, and for founding and conducting the internationally acclaimed vocal ensemble, The Star-Scape Singers in 7 Carnegie Hall performances, 8 European tours and 17 recordings. Dr. Mills inspired those he met in countries around the world with his prose and poetry, landscape and floral paintings, haute couture designs, and recorded choral and orchestral compositions, including ""The Fire Mass"" and symphony ""Majestic Landscape."" Special honours received by him include an Honorary Doctorate from Wolfe's University of King's College, Cambridge; The Senate of Canada Award of Excellence for outstanding achievement in the Humanities, Education, Philosophy and Arts; the MedArt USA Special Recognition Award ""for the outstanding healing power of his Art"" and as the 1997 Honorary PRIME Mentor of Canada ""for being an exemplary mentor and for serving as a role model par excellence whom society could look up to for inspiration and guidance."" Dr. Mills was Founder of the philanthropic charitable organization Patrons of Wisdom which provided significant opportunities for young classical performers and cultural exchange since 1980. He also founded the Earthstage Actors whose dramatic performances based on his words have been called ""a modern-day Shakespeare."" Dr. Mills is survived by his sister, Mrs. Eleanor Nickerson of St. Stephen, New Brunswick and Mr. David Kennet. He will be dearly missed by the thousands who had the honour and privilege of knowing him. At the request of the deceased, there will be no memorial service. To commemorate Dr. Mills' life, donations can be made to The Kenneth G. Mills Foundation, P.O. Box 790, Station F, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4N 2Y7, to foster the extensive legacy of recorded metaphysical philosophical lectures, musical scores, artistic documentation, collections, and publications of his work.

Mr. Crystal's apparel business career spanned 35 years. During his college summers he began his career with the pushcarts on Seventh Avenue moving the merchandise from warehouse to retailer. After attending the University of North Carolina, where he played football and was ACC heavy weight wrestling champion, he entered the firm as a salesman. In 1968, David Crystal was brought public and sold a couple of years later to General Mills. After leaving the apparel industry, Mr. Crystal began a successful second career in the then new option arbitrage field where he managed money for family and friends for an additional decade. Mr. Crystal's two favorite passions were sports and flying. He founded the Westchester Pilots Association and spent countless enjoyable hours flying his Navajo. In sports, he coached youth leagues in Scarsdale, NY for 15 years. As a near scratch golfer, he won the Quaker Ridge Golf Club championship five times in four different decades. He was the first member to shoot below his age when he was 80 years old (by four strokes). Mr. Crystal gave generously to many different charities and was always there to lend a hand. His lasting legacy to his children included his belief that real honor lies in one's commitment to the endeavor. While the outcome may be in doubt, no level of preparation should be spared. Hard work would be rewarded and success had to be earned. Even in his last days, his major concern was his surviving wife, Luella of 60 years. This was as true a love story as can be found. In addition to his wife, Mr. Crystal is survived by his sister Beatrice Newman, his four sons, Robert G. Crystal Jr., Jonathan A. Crystal, Todd W.D. Crystal, Bruce P. Crystal and his only daughter Wendy C. Jacobi. In addition he leaves 16 grandchildren; 13 great grandchildren with two more on the way. He lived a charmed life. Being the son of an immigrant, he was a great athlete, astute businessman, charitable giver, loving husband and father, and proudly lived the American dream. A memorial service will be held at 11:00 AM this Friday October 15 at the McMahon, Lyon & Hartnett Funeral Home located at 491 Mamaroneck Ave., White Plains, NY (914949-7777).

The news makes Mia even more determined to realize her desire to become a hero. The writer of Green Arrow is Judd Winick, who is no stranger to tackling social issues in comics. In 2002 he wrote a story about gay bashing in Green Lantern. In 2000 he wrote and illustrated ""Pedro and Me,"" a graphic novel chronicling his friendship with Pedro Zamora, his roommate on the MTV reality series ""The Real World,"" who died of complications of AIDS. Mia will continue as a character in the monthly Green Arrow comic book, but her story will not be a grim and gritty tale. ""This isn't about being ill; this isn't about her dying,"" Mr. Winick said. ""She's not going to get sick. We have no interest in ever doing that."" Instead, the focus will be on Mia's turning her life around and being a positive force. She will eventually adopt the code name Speedy, after the first of Green Arrow's sidekicks, and she'll join other young heroes in Teen Titans. Mr. Winick plans to write Green Arrow for the long haul. ""I'd like to one day write the story where Mia gets the cure for H.I.V.,"" he said. ""It would be nice if that happened sooner rather than later."" GEORGE GENE GUSTINES",2004-10-14T05:00:00+0000

The emerging scandal is already under multiple investigations in this country, in Iraq and at the United Nations. But nothing that has surfaced so far suggests that the sanctions were failing in their main purpose, that the Bush administration's precipitous invasion was necessary or that the United Nations is fatally hobbled by corruption or incompetence.",2004-10-14T05:00:00+0000

The set, ""The Capitol Albums, Vol. 1,"" due out on Nov. 16, will be the first American release of ""Meet the Beatles,"" ""The Beatles' Second Album,"" ""Something New"" and ""Beatles '65,"" since the advent of the CD format. When the early Beatles albums were initially put on CD, in 1987, the discs copied the format and track listing of the old EMI-Parlophone British editions. The British editions were in mono, and even though they had more tracks than the American versions, they were not what Americans remembered: for example, the early-stereo ""Beatles '65"" that began with ""No Reply"" and finished 10 tracks later with ""Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby."" The new versions of the four albums -- to be released only as a boxed set and not individually -- will preserve the American version track listing and give the listener a choice of hearing them in either mono or stereo. ""If nostalgia is the intoxicant of baby boomers, these will be much more intoxicating to listen to,"" said Andy Slater, the president of Capitol Records. BEN RATLIFF",2004-10-14T05:00:00+0000

During Mr. Cohen's tenure, Mother Jones,' a bimonthly news magazine, won a National Magazine Award for general excellence in 2001, the first time that it had received such an accolade since it was founded in 1976.

The council, a volunteer monitoring group, said it is organizing opposition to proposals to raise fares by 5 percent or more, eliminate some branches and reduce the staff for services like car cleaning. Higher fares would reduce the number of riders and depress revenue, the council said. Instead, it recommended that the railroad seek more state and federal aid to close its budget gap.

Hardware stores are hard to find; Pilates instructors are not. In short, in Bend it is out with the old and in with the New West. All this change has wrought a budding cultural scene, but the main attraction remains the natural setting. This town of about 63,000 is situated at the eastern foothills of the Cascades, where pine forests give way to a high desert plateau. High country lakes and the Three Sisters Wilderness are about a half hour drive to the west, and to the east sagebrush and juniper fill ancient rimrock canyons. It's out there that Bendites prefer to spend their time, hiking, biking, golfing, climbing and kayaking. So when you visit, be prepared to be active.

The dance company, which has run the most established and storied classical ballet school primarily for African-Americans, announced last month that it was laying off 44 dancers because of $2.3 million in accumulated debt and a $1.8 million operating deficit. It had said it would keep the school running. Arthur Mitchell, the school's founder and artistic director, said he had learned the school had lost its liability insurance last Saturday but kept the school open for the week, figuring there was a misunderstanding. He said the insurance broker had told the dance company that the insurance was revoked because of a late payment. Mr. Mitchell acknowledged that the payment was late because of cash flow problems, but he said that the check had been cashed. He also said the broker told him that $112,000 was needed to continue the insurance, money that was not available. The school has 800 children, and several hundred 3-year-olds were to arrive this morning. About 15 teachers will be laid off. ""It's a staggering, staggering loss,"" Mr. Mitchell said.

On Thursday, he refused Milan's highest honor, the Golden Ambrosius award, and yesterday he skipped a planned appearance in Rome to celebrate a showcase of Italian movies in New York at the TriBeCa Film Festival, which he helped found. Italian newspapers suggested that Mr. De Niro, 61, had snubbed the Milanese and had stood up the Romans as payback for Italy's decision to delay granting him honorary Italian citizenship, originally planned for the Venice Film Festival in September. The Italian government balked after the Order of the Sons of Italy in America complained about his unflattering depictions of Italian and Italian-seeming characters in films like ""The Godfather Part 2"" and ""Shark Tale.""

The youth, Joseph T. Nee, 18, a senior at the school, was charged with conspiracy to commit mass murder and anarchy. The police in Marshfield, about 30 miles south of Boston, said Mr. Nee was one of ""two principals"" in the plot, along with a 16-year-old who was arrested Sept. 17. After that arrest, officers found hand-drawn maps of the high school, as well as a list of guns, ammunition, bombs, and students and teachers who were singled out.

us,"Arts, Briefly; 'Fahrenheit' vs. 'Celsius'","The conservative group Citizens United said its film ""Celsius 41.11,"" which is billed as a rebuttal to Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 911,"" would open on Friday in theaters in 40 cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Tallahassee, Fla., and elsewhere in electoral battleground states. Directed by Kevin Knoblock, the film, already playing in Washington, is devoted in part to responding to allegations in Mr. Moore's film about President Bush and Sept. 11, but it also attacks the career of the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry. The Federal Election Commission recently blocked the group from paying to broadcast or promote the film on television in the 60 days before the election because it is partisan. An online trailer for ""Celsius 41.11"" -- the temperature is that at which brain cells start to die -- includes an image of Mr. Moore holding dynamite and an unidentified Bush critic discussing the virtues of some dictators.

The gallery said it had been advised by lawyers that it might influence a trial in London. Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, whose trial began on Oct. 8, is charged with shooting and beating civilians at checkpoints while he was a commander in the Sarobi district of Kabul Province from 1992 to 1996. ""The House of Osama bin Laden"" is a 12-minute interactive digital reconstruction, which allows visitors to explore a remote house in Afghanistan formerly occupied by Osama bin Laden. The film was created when the artists Langlands & Bell were commissioned by the Imperial War Museum to visit Afghanistan in 2002, after the Taliban was overthrown, and has been exhibited at the war museum. A spokesman for Tate Britain said the withdrawal of the work would not affect Langlands & Bell's chances of winning the Turner Prize, Britain's leading contemporary art award, because all members of the jury had seen it. Other artists shortlisted for this year's prize, to be awarded on Dec. 6, are Kutlug Ataman, Jeremy Deller and Yinka Shonabare. PAM KENT",2004-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Woolworths on Monday gave shareholders until the end of the day to sell it at least 4 percent of Australian Leisure, raising its stake to 20 percent or higher and possibly giving it enough shares to block Coles in any proxy battle.

Loving grandfather of Linsay Firman. A legend in the textile industry, fondly known as ""The King of the Mills.""

After the war he joined Mastercraft Weaving Corporation in New Jersey as a trainee and in 1960 became the president of the company which had moved to North Carolina.

In 1984 he was elected to the C & A Board. In 1994, at his retirement, the original Mastercraft plant, which he had built, was renamed in his honor.

In 1999 he was elected to the Board of Directors of Joan Fabrics Corp. The recipient of numerous industry and civic awards, including the first Lifetime Leadership Award from Dupont in 1995, which embodied his creativity, devotion and legendary status in the industry.

As demand continues to increase, domestic air fares could rise 1 percent to 3 percent, the survey said. Other recent surveys have shown that corporate travel managers are keeping the pressure on domestic prices by continuing to increase their use of cheaper, nonrefundable advance-purchase fares that formerly were categorized as leisure-market fares. International business-class fares, meanwhile, are expected to rise 2 percent to 5 percent, the survey said. In North America, corporate rates for hotels in the mid and upper ranges are expected to rise as much as 3 percent. Business travel grew most sharply on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes, as well as to South America, said Mr. Davis, who added: ""These trends, we believe, will place upward pressure on prices as demand begins to outpace supply.""",2004-10-19T05:00:00+0000

The recommendation was a response to questions about a new municipal election system, known as instant runoff voting, in which voters rank their top three choices in local races. The system has led to unusual cooperation among candidates for the Board of Supervisors, including mutual endorsements intended to draw second- and third-choice votes. The commission's staff suggested exempting candidates who showed that the endorsements advanced their own candidacies. The vote was 2 to 1 in favor, but three votes were needed.

After noticing the spilled soup on the patient's lap, Mr. Spitzer contended, a nurse, Annamma Thomas, 59, of Yonkers, pushed the patient, an 84-year-old woman who uses a wheelchair and who suffers from dementia, into a hallway and left her there for an hour. She and another nurse, Lynn Mathison, 53, of Bronxville, allegedly documented that Ms. Thomas had immediately treated the patient, Mr. Spitzer said. The women surrendered to the Yonkers police on Oct. 8 and, according to Ms. Thomas's lawyer, Bruce E. Menken, pleaded not guilty. Kirk Semple (NYT)",2004-10-20T05:00:00+0000

The screenplay is by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, best known for their script for ""The Commitments."" But they have a Beatles connection as well, having written two films -- ""Bullshot"" in 1983 and ""Water"" in 1985 -- for Handmade Films, the company owned at the time by George Harrison, above. Other films, from ""All This and World War II"" in 1976 to ""I Am Sam"" in 2002, have used Beatles songs as central elements, but ""All You Need Is Love"" is going a step further: the actors will do the singing. Because Mr. Clement and Mr. Frenais are still writing their script, filming -- and for that matter, casting -- is not yet scheduled. ALLAN KOZINN",2004-10-21T05:00:00+0000

That vote prompted the United States and France to sponsor a United Nations resolution calling on Syria to relinquish its control over Lebanon. The poisonous relation between the two men has long stymied much-anticipated economic and other reforms. It remained unclear who might form the next government.

The American Civil Liberties Union, its officers, Board of Directors and staff deeply mourn the passing of a dear colleague and friend, Carol Pitchersky. Serving as the ACLU Foundation's Development Director and Associate Director from 1979 to 1988, Carol was an exceptionally talented development professional, whose passion and devotion to civil liberties and social justice led her to the ACLU where she made a unique contribution at an extraordinarily difficult period in the organization's long history. At a time when principles reigned but resources were severely diminished, Carol brought unparalleled integrity, vision and an unflagging commitment to defending civil liberties for all. She played a key role in helping the ACLU emerge from the shadows of crisis following the Skokie controversy to a position of stability and vigor, strengthening the organization's infrastructure, both financial and organizational. It is no exaggeration to say that her leadership role in developing the Major Gifts Program, expanding the Foundation Gifts Program and initiating the Planned Giving Program made the ACLU what it is today. From her tireless labors, ACLU contributors became not just checkbook participants, but proud card-carrying members whose donations would provide the firm foundation for the reinvigorated civil liberties organization that the ACLU is now today. We will joyously celebrate her exemplary life by continuing our work in the principled, forthright and fervent way in which Carol lived her life--and ultimately enriched ours. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her husband and our former colleague, Morton Halperin, and to all those whose lives she so graciously touched.",2004-10-21T05:00:00+0000

But the last time he sang at Carnegie Hall, he played God. That was at the recital debut of the countertenor David Daniels, who brought Mr. Griffey in for Britten's cantical ""Abraham and Isaac,"" which they opened singing beautifully together in the dark. This weekend, it's Mr. Griffey's turn in the spotlight: he's making his own New York recital debut at Zankel Hall. The ambitious program centers on 20th-century British and American composers from Vaughn Williams to Barber. One feature is the world premiere of a four-song cycle by Andr Previn, who will accompany Mr. Griffey himself. Another premiere is a set of transcriptions of Copland folk songs for voice and guitar by Johannes Tonio Kreusch. Joining Mr. Griffey's party are his accompanist, Warren Jones, and the string quartet the Fountain Ensemble, but the main draw remains the tenor's straightforward yet deceptively subtle artistry. Mr. Griffey will be back at Carnegie Hall soon, in Britten's ""War Requiem"" on Nov. 11. (Tomorrow night at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $28 to $38.)

us,The Listings; WILLIAM KING,"In the 1950's, when Abstract Expressionism was breathing fire down most painters' necks and Pop Art had not yet coalesced into a exclusive club, many artists found an escape route to originality in figuration with a modern bent, in which a lean stylish abbreviation of reality, promulgated by a blunt, slightly flamboyant use of materials, prevailed. The late, great David Park is one example; the best-known current practitioner is surely Alex Katz. William King, known (when he is known at all) for lanky, caricaturelike figures in wood, clay and vinyl, is due a little more attention. To that end, the Alexandre Gallery is displaying 44 examples of that artist's ceramic heads, made between 1952 and 1987. This smirking, grimacing, laughing horde of slightly smaller-than-life-size heads looks back to Nadelman and Daumier and sideways to Red Grooms and Claes Oldenburg with slightly slovenly forms and features that convey a richly mysterious mix of personality and emotions. (Not for nothing are two comic versions of the Sphinx on hand.) There are also terra cotta self-portraits of the pointy-nosed artist, glasses and all; portraits of other artists like Marisol and Leonard Baskin; the odd historical figure (Benjamin Franklin); and numerous mythic beings: faun, two muses and a king of cats. One of the best in show is a self-portrait of the artist as Queen Victoria. (Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 755-2828, through Nov. 6; free.)

us,The Listings; CASSANDRA WILSON,"The singer Cassandra Wilson, above, broke through to the greater world outside jazz 11 years ago with a sly record called ""Blue Light 'Til Dawn."" It was intuitive about jazz's possible affinities with pop, country and blues; like so many great statements in jazz, it started with decisions about what instruments to include, and which to exclude. (I don't think I've ever seen a saxophone in her band in more than 15 years of watching, though there have been string instruments and pitched percussion instruments aplenty: acoustic and electric guitars, dobros, steel guitars, violins, vibraphones, accordions, marimbas, frame drums.) And like so many great statements in pop, it felt its way along, never asserting itself as only one thing. Ms. Wilson brought in elements of all the black, white and pan-American music she enjoyed and, with a few gifted producers, bent them to her will. The hard thing in this jazz-pop balancing act is to stay sharp both aesthetically and commercially. But Ms. Wilson has done it remarkably well, keeping her artifice and her mystery. She's between albums now -- her most recent, ""Glamoured,"" came out a year ago -- and the principal thrill of her show tonight at Jazz at Lincoln Center's new Rose Hall, aside from gawking at the architecture and experiencing the fussed-over acoustics, will be to see what new kinds of songs she's adding to her repertory.

And this promises to be a very good season for Mr. Alessandrini's long-lived brainchild, which began its loving evisceration of New York theater in 1982. After all, what sharp-toothed satirist could hope for better fare to chew on than ""Bombay Dreams,"" ""Dracula"" and the goyische revival of ""Fiddler on the Roof""? These productions are all on the butcher block in the show's latest edition, ""Forbidden Broadway: Special Victims Unit,"" which began previews last week at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater. (In the opening lines of the ""Fiddler"" segment, the actor playing Alfred Molina, the revival's star, irresistibly says: ""A 'Fiddler' with no Jew. Sounds crazy, no?"") The ""Forbidden"" target range extends beyond things strictly artistic, using insider gossip as fodder for spicy routines like an imagined cat fight between Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, the original stars of ""Wicked"" (with Gina Kreiezmar, above left, and Jennifer Simard). The sexual iconography of Hugh Jackman playing Peter Allen is slid under the microscope for ""The Boy Who's Odd."" And for fans (and detractors) of middlebrow drama, ""I Am My Own Wife,"" the solo show about a German transvestite, is reincarnated as a one-man he-said, she-said dialogue called -- but of course -- ""I Am My Own Cast.""

But what will really get people talking are two scenes, one in which Anna shares a naked bath with the child (played by Cameron Bright) and one in which Anna's angry fianc (Danny Huston) bounces the child around an apartment and brutally slams him into a table. Do the scenes cross the line from entertaining shock value into offensiveness? Viewers who think so should remember that the line has inexorably moved, year by year.

us,'Runaway',"Carla heard the car coming before it topped the little rise in the road that around here they called a hill. ItAs her, she thought. Mrs. JamiesonASylviaAhome from her holiday in Greece. From the barn doorAbut far enough inside that she could not readily be seenAshe watched the road Mrs. Jamieson would have to drive by on, her place being half a mile farther along the road than Clark and CarlaAs.If it was somebody getting ready to turn in at their gate it would be slowing down by now. But still Carla hoped. Let it not be her.It was. Mrs. Jamieson turned her head once, quicklyAshe had all she could do maneuvering her car through the ruts and puddles the rain had made in the gravelAbut she didnAt lift a hand off the wheel to wave, she didnAt spot Carla. Carla got a glimpse of a tanned arm bare to the shoulder, hair bleached a lighter color than it had been before, more white now than silver-blond, and an expression that was determined and exasperated and amused at her own exasperationAjust the way Mrs. Jamieson would look negotiating such a road. When she turned her head there was something like a bright flashAof inquiry, of hopefulnessAthat made Carla shrink back.So.Maybe Clark didnAt know yet. If he was sitting at the computer he would have his back to the window and the road.But Mrs. Jamieson might have to make another trip. Driv- ing home from the airport, she might not have stopped for groceriesAnot until sheAd been home and figured out what she needed. Clark might see her then. And after dark, the lights of her house would show. But this was July, and it didnAt get dark till late. She might be so tired that she wouldnAt bother with the lights, she might go to bed early.On the other hand, she might telephone. Any time now.This was the summer of rain and more rain. You heard it first thing in the morning, loud on the roof of the mobile home. The trails were deep in mud, the long grass soaking, leaves overhead sending down random showers even in those moments when there was no actual downpour from the sky and the clouds looked like clearing. Carla wore a high, wide-brimmed old Australian felt hat every time she went outside, and tucked her long thick braid down her shirt.Nobody showed up for trail rides, even though Clark and Carla had gone around posting signs in all the camping sites, in the cafes, and on the tourist office billboard and anywhere else they could think of. Only a few pupils were coming for lessons and those were regulars, not the batches of schoolchildren on vacation, the busloads from summer camps, that had kept them going through last summer. And even the regulars that they counted on were taking time off for holiday trips, or simply cancelling their lessons because of the weather being so discouraging. If they called too late, Clark charged them for the time anyway. A couple of them had complained, and quit for good.There was still some income from the three horses that were boarded. Those three, and the four of their own, were out in the field now, poking around in the grass under the trees. They looked as if they couldnAt be bothered to notice that the rain was holding off for the moment, the way it often did for a while in the afternoon. Just enough to get your hopes upAthe clouds whitening and thinning and letting through a diffuse brightness that never got around to being real sunshine, and was usually gone before supper.Carla had finished mucking out in the barn. She had taken her timeAshe liked the rhythm of her regular chores, the high space under the barn roof, the smells. Now she went over to the exercise ring to see how dry the ground was, in case the five oAclock pupil did show up.Most of the steady showers had not been particularly heavy, or borne on any wind, but last week there had come a sud- den stirring and then a blast through the treetops and a nearly horizontal blinding rain. In a quarter of an hour the storm had passed over. But branches lay across the road, hydro lines were down, and a large chunk of the plastic roofing over the ring had been torn loose. There was a puddle like a lake at that end of the track, and Clark had worked until after dark, digging a channel to drain it away.The roof had not yet been repaired. Clark had strung fence wire across to keep the horses from getting into the mud, and Carla had marked out a shorter track.On the Web, right now, Clark was hunting for someplace to buy roofing. Some salvage outlet, with prices that they could afford, or somebody trying to get rid of such material secondhand. He would not go to Hy and Robbert BuckleyAs Building Supply in town, which he called Highway Robbers Buggery Supply, because he owed them too much money and had had a fight with them.Clark had fights not just with the people he owed money to. His friendliness, compelling at first, could suddenly turn sour. There were places he would not go into, where he always made Carla go, because of some row. The drugstore was one such place. An old woman had pushed in front of himAthat is, she had gone to get something sheAd forgotten and come back and pushed in front, rather than going to the end of the line, and he had complained, and the cashier had said to him, AShe has emphysema,A and Clark had said, AIs that so? I have piles, myself,A and the manager had been summoned, to say that was uncalled-for. And in the coffee shop out on the highway the advertised breakfast discount had not been allowed, because it was past eleven oAclock in the morning, and Clark had argued and then dropped his takeout cup of coffee on the floorAjust missing, so they said, a child in its stroller. He said the child was half a mile away and he dropped the cup because no cuff had been provided. They said he had not asked for a cuff. He said he shouldnAt have had to ask.AYou flare up,A said Carla.AThatAs what men do.AShe had not said anything to him about his row with Joy Tucker. Joy Tucker was the librarian from town who boarded her horse with them. The horse was a quick-tempered little chestnut mare named LizzieAJoy Tucker, when she was in a jokey mood, called her Lizzie Borden. Yesterday she had driven out, not in a jokey mood at all, and complained about the roofAs not being fixed yet, and Lizzie looking miserable, as if she might have caught a chill.There was nothing the matter with Lizzie, actually. Clark had triedAfor himAto be placating. But then it was Joy Tucker who flared up and said that their place was a dump, and Lizzie deserved better, and Clark said, ASuit yourself.A Joy had notAor not yetAremoved Lizzie, as Carla had expected. But Clark, who had formerly made the little mare his pet, had refused to have anything more to do with her. LizzieAs feelings were hurt, in consequenceAshe was balky when exercised and kicked up a fuss when her hoofs had to be picked out, as they did every day, lest they develop a fungus. Carla had to watch out for nips.But the worst thing as far as Carla was concerned was the absence of Flora, the little white goat who kept the horses company in the barn and in the fields. There had not been any sign of her for two days. Carla was afraid that wild dogs or coyotes had got her, or even a bear.She had dreamt of Flora last night and the night before. In the first dream Flora had walked right up to the bed with a red apple in her mouth, but in the second dreamAlast nightAshe had run away when she saw Carla coming. Her leg seemed to be hurt but she ran anyway. She led Carla to a barbed-wire barricade of the kind that might belong on some battlefield, and then sheAFloraAslipped through it, hurt leg and all, just slithered through like a white eel and disappeared.The horses had seen Carla go across to the ring and they had all moved up to the fenceAlooking bedraggled in spite of their New Zealand blanketsAso that she would take notice of them on her way back. She talked quietly to them, apologizing for coming empty-handed. She stroked their necks and rubbed their noses and asked whether they knew anything about Flora.Grace and Juniper snorted and nuzzled up, as if they recognized the name and shared her concern, but then Lizzie butted in between them and knocked GraceAs head away from CarlaAs petting hand. She gave the hand a nip for good measure, and Carla had to spend some time scolding her.Up until three years ago Carla never really looked at mobile homes. She didnAt call them that, either. Like her parents, she would have thought Amobile homeA pretentious. Some people lived in trailers, and that was all there was to it. One trailer was no different from another. When Carla moved in here, when she chose this life with Clark, she began to see things in a new way. After that she started saying Amobile homeA and she looked to see how people had fixed them up. The kind of curtains they had hung, the way they had painted the trim, the ambitious decks or patios or extra rooms that had been built on. She could hardly wait to get at such improvements herself.Clark had gone along with her ideas, for a while. He had built new steps, and spent a lot of time looking for an old wrought-iron railing for them. He didnAt make any complaint about the money spent on paint for the kitchen and bathroom or the material for curtains. Her paint job was hastyAshe didnAt know, at that time, that you should take the hinges off the cupboard doors. Or that you should line the curtains, which had since faded.What Clark balked at was tearing up the carpet, which was the same in every room and the thing that she had most counted on replacing. It was divided into small brown squares, each with a pattern of darker brown and rust and tan squiggles and shapes. For a long time she had thought these were the same squig- gles and shapes, arranged in the same way, in each square. Then when she had had more time, a lot of time, to examine them, she decided that there were four patterns joined together to make identical larger squares. Sometimes she could pick out the arrangement easily and sometimes she had to work to see it.She did this when it was raining outside and ClarkAs mood weighted down all their inside space, and he did not want to pay attention to anything but the computer screen. But the best thing to do then was to invent or remember some job to do in the barn. The horses would not look at her when she was unhappy, but Flora, who was never tied up, would come and rub against her, and look up with an expression that was not quite sympathyAit was more like comradely mockeryAin her shimmering yellow-green eyes.Flora had been a half-grown kid when Clark brought her home from a farm where he had gone to bargain for some horse tackle. The people there were giving up on the country life, or at least on the raising of animalsAthey had sold their horses but failed to get rid of their goats. He had heard about how a goat was able to bring a sense of ease and comfort into a horse stable and he wanted to try it. They had meant to breed her someday but there had never been any signs of her coming into heat.At first she had been ClarkAs pet entirely, following him everywhere, dancing for his attention. She was quick and graceful and provocative as a kitten, and her resemblance to a guileless girl in love had made them both laugh. But as she grew older she seemed to attach herself to Carla, and in this attachment she was suddenly much wiser, less skittishAshe seemed capable, instead, of a subdued and ironic sort of humor. CarlaAs behavior with the horses was tender and strict and rather maternal, but the comradeship with Flora was quite different, Flora allowing her no sense of superiority.AStill no sign of Flora?A she said, as she pulled off her barn boots. Clark had posted a Lost Goat notice on the Web.ANot so far,A he said, in a preoccupied but not unfriendly voice. He suggested, not for the first time, that Flora might have just gone off to find herself a billy.No word about Mrs. Jamieson. Carla put the kettle on. Clark was humming to himself as he often did when he sat in front of the computer.Sometimes he talked back to it. Bullshit, he would say, replying to some challenge. Or he would laughAbut could not remember what the joke was, when she asked him afterwards.Carla called, ADo you want tea?A and to her surprise he got up and came into the kitchen.ASo,A he said. ASo, Carla.AAWhat?AASo she phoned.AAWho?AAHer Majesty. Queen Sylvia. She just got back.AAI didnAt hear the car.AAI didnAt ask you if you did.AASo what did she phone for?AAShe wants you to go and help her straighten up the house. ThatAs what she said. Tomorrow.AAWhat did you tell her?AAI told her sure. But you better phone up and confirm.ACarla said, AI donAt see why I have to, if you told her.A She poured out their mugs of tea. AI cleaned up her house before she left. I donAt see what there could be to do so soon.AAMaybe some coons got in and made a mess of it while she was gone. You never know.AAI donAt have to phone her right this minute,A she said. AI want to drink my tea and I want to have a shower.AAThe sooner the better.ACarla took her tea into the bathroom, calling back, AWe have to go to the laundromat. Even when the towels dry out they smell moldy.AAWeAre not changing the subject, Carla.AEven after sheAd got in the shower he stood outside the door and called to her.AI am not going to let you off the hook, Carla.AShe thought he might still be standing there when she came out, but he was back at the computer. She dressed as if she was going to townAshe hoped that if they could get out of here, go to the laundromat, get a takeout at the cappuccino place, they might be able to talk in a different way, some release might be possible. She went into the living room with a brisk step and put her arms around him from behind. But as soon as she did that a wave of grief swallowed her upAit must have been the heat of the shower, loosening her tearsAand she bent over him, all crumbling and crying.He took his hands off the keyboard but sat still.AJust donAt be mad at me,A she said.AIAm not mad. I hate when youAre like this, thatAs all.AAIAm like this because youAre mad.AADonAt tell me what I am. YouAre choking me. Start supper.AThat was what she did. It was obvious by now that the five oAclock person wasnAt coming. She got out the potatoes and began to peel them, but her tears would not stop and she could not see what she was doing. She wiped her face with a paper towel and tore off a fresh one to take with her and went out into the rain. She didnAt go into the barn because it was too miserable in there without Flora. She walked along the lane back to the woods. The horses were in the other field. They came over to the fence to watch her. All of them except Lizzie, who capered and snorted a bit, had the sense to understand that her attention was elsewhere.. . .It had started when they read the obituary, Mr. JamiesonAs obituary. That was in the city paper, and his face had been on the evening news. Up until the year before, they had known the Jamiesons only as neighbors who kept to themselves. She taught Botany at the college forty miles away, so she had to spend a good deal of her time on the road. He was a poet.Everybody knew that much. But he seemed to be occupied with other things. For a poet, and for an old manAperhaps twenty years older than Mrs. JamiesonAhe was rugged and active. He improved the drainage system on his place, cleaning out the culvert and lining it with rocks. He dug and planted and fenced a vegetable garden, cut paths through the woods, looked after repairs on the house.The house itself was an odd-looking triangular affair that he had built years ago, with some friends, on the foundation of an old wrecked farmhouse. Those people were spoken of as hippiesAthough Mr. Jamieson must have been a bit old for that, even then, before Mrs. JamiesonAs time. There was a story that they grew marijuana in the woods, sold it, and stored the money in sealed glass jars, which were buried around the property. Clark had heard this from the people he got to know in town. He said it was bullshit.AElse somebody would have got in and dug it up, before now. Somebody would have found a way to make him tell where it was.AWhen they read the obituary Carla and Clark learned for the first time that Leon Jamieson had been the recipient of a large prize, five years before his death. A prize for poetry. Nobody had ever mentioned this. It seemed that people could believe in dope money buried in glass jars, but not in money won for writing poetry.Shortly after this Clark said, AWe couldAve made him pay.ACarla knew at once what he was talking about, but she took it as a joke.AToo late now,A she said. AYou canAt pay once youAre dead.AAHe canAt. She could.AASheAs gone to Greece.AASheAs not going to stay in Greece.AAShe didnAt know,A said Carla more soberly.AI didnAt say she did.AAShe doesnAt have a clue about it.AAWe could fix that.ACarla said, ANo. No.AClark went on as if she had not spoken.AWe could say weAre going to sue. People get money for stuff like that all the time.AAHow could you do that? You canAt sue a dead person.AAThreaten to go to the papers. Big-time poet. The papers would eat it up. All we have to do is threaten and sheAd cave in.AAYouAre just fantasizing,A Carla said. AYouAre joking.AANo,A said Clark. AActually, IAm not.ACarla said she did not want to talk about it anymore and he said okay.But they talked about it the next day, and the next and the next. He sometimes got notions like this that were not practicable, which might even be illegal. He talked about them with growing excitement and thenAshe wasnAt sure whyAhe dropped them. If the rain had stopped, if this had turned into something like a normal summer, he might have let this idea go the way of the others. But that had not happened, and during the last month he had harped on the scheme as if it was perfectly feasible and serious. The question was how much money to ask for. Too little, and the woman might not take them seriously, she might be inclined to see if they were bluffing. Too much might get her back up and she might become stubborn.Carla had stopped saying that it was a joke. Instead she told him that it wouldnAt work. She said that for one thing, people expected poets to be that way. So it wouldnAt be worth paying out money to cover it up.He said that it would work if it was done right. Carla was to break down and tell Mrs. Jamieson the whole story. Then Clark would move in, as if it had all been a surprise to him, he had just found out. He would be outraged, he would talk about telling the world. He would let Mrs. Jamieson be the one who first mentioned money.AYou were injured. You were molested and humiliated and I was injured and humiliated because you are my wife. ItAs a question of respect.AOver and over again he talked to her in this way and she tried to deflect him but he insisted.APromise,A he said. APromise.AThis was because of what she had told him, things she could not now retract or deny.Sometimes he gets interested in me?The old guy?Sometimes he calls me into the room when sheAs not there?Yes.When she has to go out shopping and the nurse isnAt there either.A lucky inspiration of hers, one that instantly pleased him.So what do you do then? Do you go in?She played shy.Sometimes.He calls you into his room. So? Carla? So, then?I go in to see what he wants.So what does he want?This was asked and told in whispers, even if there was nobody to hear, even when they were in the neverland of their bed. A bedtime story, in which the details were important and had to be added to every time, and this with convincing reluctance, shyness, giggles, dirty, dirty. And it was not only he who was eager and grateful. She was too. Eager to please and excite him, to excite herself. Grateful every time it still worked.And in one part of her mind it was true, she saw the randy old man, the bump he made in the sheet, bedridden indeed, almost beyond speech but proficient in sign language, indicating his desire, trying to nudge and finger her into complicity, into obliging stunts and intimacies. (Her refusal a necessity, but also perhaps strangely, slightly disappointing, to Clark.)Now and then came an image that she had to hammer down, lest it spoil everything. She would think of the real dim and sheeted body, drugged and shrinking every day in its rented hospital bed, glimpsed only a few times when Mrs. Jamieson or the visiting nurse had neglected to close the door. She herself never actually coming closer to him than that.In fact she had dreaded going to the JamiesonsA, but she needed the money, and she felt sorry for Mrs. Jamieson, who seemed so haunted and bewildered, as if she was walking in her sleep. Once or twice Carla had burst out and done something really silly just to loosen up the atmosphere. The kind of thing she did when clumsy and terrified first-time horseback riders were feeling humiliated. She used to try that too when Clark was stuck in his moods. It didnAt work with him anymore. But the story about Mr. Jamieson had worked, decisively.There was no way to avoid the puddles in the path or the tall soaked grass alongside it, or the wild carrot which had recently come into flower. But the air was warm enough so that she didnAt get chilly. Her clothes were soaked through as if by her own sweat or the tears that ran down her face with the drizzle of rain. Her weeping petered out in time. She had nothing to wipe her nose onAthe paper towel now soggyAbut she leaned over and blew it hard into a puddle.She lifted her head and managed the long-drawn-out, vibrating whistle that was her signalAClarkAs tooAfor Flora. She waited a couple of minutes and then called FloraAs name. Over and over again, whistle and name, whistle and name.Flora did not respond.It was almost a relief, though, to feel the single pain of missing Flora, of missing Flora perhaps forever, compared to the mess she had got into concerning Mrs. Jamieson, and her seesaw misery with Clark. At least FloraAs leaving was not on account of anything that sheACarlaAhad done wrong.At the house, there was nothing for Sylvia to do except to open the windows. And to thinkAwith an eagerness that dismayed without really surprising herAof how soon she could see Carla.All the paraphernalia of illness had been removed. The room that had been Sylvia and her husbandAs bedroom and then his death chamber had been cleaned out and tidied up to look as if nothing had ever happened in it. Carla had helped with all that during the few frenzied days between the crematorium and the departure for Greece. Every piece of clothing Leon had ever worn and some things he hadnAt, including gifts from his sisters that had never been taken out of their packages, had been piled in the backseat of the car and delivered to the Thrift Shop. His pills, his shaving things, unopened cans of the fortified drink that had sustained him as long as anything could, cartons of the sesame seed snaps that at one time he had eaten by the dozens, the plastic bottles full of the lotion that had eased his back, the sheepskins on which he had lainAall of that was dumped into plastic bags to be hauled away as garbage, and Carla didnAt question a thing. She never said, AMaybe somebody could use that,A or pointed out that whole cartons of cans were unopened. When Sylvia said, AI wish I hadnAt taken the clothes to town. I wish IAd burned them all up in the incinerator,A Carla had shown no surprise.They cleaned the oven, scrubbed out the cupboards, wiped down the walls and the windows. One day Sylvia sat in the living room going through all the condolence letters she had received. (There was no accumulation of papers and notebooks to be attended to, as you might have expected with a writer, no unfinished work or scribbled drafts. He had told her, months before, that he had pitched everything. And no regrets.)The south-sloping wall of the house was made up of big windows. Sylvia looked up, surprised by the watery sunlight that had come outAor possibly surprised by the shadow of Carla, bare-legged, bare-armed, on top of a ladder, her resolute face crowned with a frizz of dandelion hair that was too short for the braid. She was vigorously spraying and scrubbing the glass. When she saw Sylvia looking at her she stopped and flung out her arms as if she was splayed there, making a silly gargoyle-like face. They both began to laugh. Sylvia felt this laughter running all through her like a playful stream. She went back to her letters as Carla resumed the cleaning. She decided that all of these kind wordsAgenuine or perfunctory, the tributes and regretsAcould go the way of the sheepskins and the crackers.When she heard Carla taking the ladder down, heard boots on the deck, she was suddenly shy. She sat where she was with her head bowed as Carla came into the room and passed behind her on her way to the kitchen to put the pail and the cloths back under the sink. Carla hardly halted, she was quick as a bird, but she managed to drop a kiss on SylviaAs bent head. Then she went on whistling something to herself.That kiss had been in SylviaAs mind ever since. It meant nothing in particular. It meant Cheer up. Or Almost done. It meant that they were good friends who had got through a lot of depressing work together. Or maybe just that the sun had come out. That Carla was thinking of getting home to her horses. Nevertheless, Sylvia saw it as a bright blossom, its petals spreading inside her with tumultuous heat, like a menopausal flash.Every so often there had been a special girl student in one of her botany classesAone whose cleverness and dedication and awkward egotism, or even genuine passion for the natural world, reminded her of her young self. Such girls hung around her worshipfully, hoped for some sort of intimacy they could notAin most casesAimagine, and they soon got on her nerves.Carla was nothing like them. If she resembled anybody in SylviaAs life, it would have to be certain girls she had known in high schoolAthose who were bright but never too bright, easy athletes but not strenuously competitive, buoyant but not rambunctious. Naturally happy.AWhere I was, this little village, this little tiny village with my two old friends, well, it was the sort of place where the very occasional tourist bus would stop, just as if it had got lost, and the tourists would get off and look around and they were absolutely bewildered because they werenAt anywhere. There was nothing to buy.ASylvia was speaking about Greece. Carla was sitting a few feet away from her. The large-limbed, uncomfortable, dazzling girl was sitting there at last, in the room that had been filled with thoughts of her. She was faintly smiling, belatedly nodding.AAnd at first,A Sylvia said, Aat first I was bewildered too. It was so hot. But itAs true about the light. ItAs wonderful. And then I figured out what there was to do, and there were just these few simple things but they could fill the day. You walk half a mile down the road to buy some oil and half a mile in the other direction to buy your bread or your wine, and thatAs the morning, and you eat some lunch under the trees and after lunch itAs too hot to do anything but close the shutters and lie on your bed and maybe read. At first you read. And then it gets so you donAt even do that. Why read? Later on you notice the shadows are longer and you get up and go for a swim.AOh,A she interrupted herself. AOh, I forgot.AShe jumped up and went to get the present she had brought, which in fact she had not forgotten about at all. She had not wanted to hand it to Carla right away, she had wanted the moment to come more naturally, and while she was speaking she had thought ahead to the moment when she could mention the sea, going swimming. And say, as she now said, ASwimming reminded me of this because itAs a little replica, you know, itAs a little replica of the horse they found under the sea. Cast in bronze. They dredged it up, after all this time. ItAs supposed to be from the second century b.c.AWhen Carla had come in and looked around for work to do, Sylvia had said, AOh, just sit down a minute, I havenAt had anybody to talk to since I got back. Please.A Carla had sat down on the edge of a chair, legs apart, hands between her knees, looking somehow desolate. As if reaching for some distant politeness she had said, AHow was Greece?ANow she was standing, with the tissue paper crumpled around the horse, which she had not fully unwrapped.AItAs said to represent a racehorse,A Sylvia said. AMaking that final spurt, the last effort in a race. The rider, too, the boy, you can see heAs urging the horse on to the limit of its strength.AShe did not mention that the boy had made her think of Carla, and she could not now have said why. He was only about ten or eleven years old. Maybe the strength and grace of the arm that must have held the reins, or the wrinkles in his childish forehead, the absorption and the pure effort there was in some way like Carla cleaning the big windows last spring. Her strong legs in her shorts, her broad shoulders, her big swipes at the glass, and then the way she had splayed herself out as a joke, inviting or even commanding Sylvia to laugh.AYou can see that,A Carla said, now conscientiously examining the little bronzy-green statue. AThank you very much.AAYou are welcome. LetAs have coffee, shall we? IAve just made some. The coffee in Greece was quite strong, a little stronger than I liked, but the bread was heavenly. And the ripe figs, they were astounding. Sit down another moment, please do. You should stop me going on and on this way. What about here? How has life been here?AAItAs been raining most of the time.AAI can see that. I can see it has,A Sylvia called from the kitchen end of the big room. Pouring the coffee, she decided that she would keep quiet about the other gift she had brought. It hadnAt cost her anything (the horse had cost more than the girl could probably guess), it was only a beautiful small pinkish-white stone she had picked up along the road.AThis is for Carla,A she had said to her friend Maggie, who was walking beside her. AI know itAs silly. I just want her to have a tiny piece of this land.AShe had already mentioned Carla to Maggie, and to Soraya, her other friend there, telling them how the girlAs presence had come to mean more and more to her, how an indescribable bond had seemed to grow up between them, and had consoled her in the awful months of last spring.AIt was just to see somebodyAsomebody so fresh and full of health coming into the house.AMaggie and Soraya had laughed in a kindly but annoying way.AThereAs always a girl,A Soraya said, with an indolent stretch of her heavy brown arms, and Maggie said, AWe all come to it sometime. A crush on a girl.ASylvia was obscurely angered by that dated wordAcrush.AMaybe itAs because Leon and I never had children,A she said. AItAs stupid. Displaced maternal love.AHer friends spoke at the same time, saying in slightly different ways something to the effect that it might be stupid but it was, after all, love.",2004-10-24T05:00:00+0000

us,A Moralist of the Midwest,"On a hill near Iowa City, a white clapboard Congregational church with bright red doors stands tucked by the side of a narrow, weed-lined road stretching through fields that used to be prairie. One cloudy afternoon in August, the novelist Marilynne Robinson and her friend Maggie Conroy, a playwright and the wife of the writer Frank Conroy, peered inside the windows. Robinson, dressed in jeans and two linen shirts, one layered over the other, cupped her hand to the pane, blocking the light to illuminate what she couldn't make out within. Soon the pastor, Jerry -- a jovial fellow in sandals -- came along and unlocked the doors. Inside, the church was surprisingly small. It had no middle aisle -- it was founded by Welsh settlers in 1846, when, as Robinson pointed out, weddings were still conducted in parlors -- and its walls were covered, bizarrely, with garish wallpaper. Taking in the room, Robinson said, with great, throaty satisfaction, ""You can really feel the density of presence here.""",2004-10-24T05:00:00+0000

In Ian McEwan's first-person novel, Parry is less a flesh-and-blood character than a device for exploring Joe's growing awareness of the inconstancy of love: you even wonder if he's a figment of Joe's imagination. Onscreen, however, in the person of the 6-foot-2-inch Mr. Ifans, he is definitely -- and discomfitingly -- solid: a looming blob of need, his eyes moist with adoration for the man he is convinced loves him back, his lips quivering as he searches for words to capture what's in his heart.",2004-10-24T05:00:00+0000

The energy with which she set about reforming filthy, disease-ridden hospitals, the devotion with which she cared for soldiers (refusing to show any special favor to officers), the image she presented, above all, of a ministering angel who brought comfort to the dying -- all these things made her perfect material for a heroine.

Robinson, dressed in jeans and two linen shirts, one layered over the other, cupped her hand to the pane, blocking the light to illuminate what she couldn't make out within. Soon the pastor, Jerry -- a jovial fellow in sandals -- came along and unlocked the doors. Inside, the church was surprisingly small. It had no middle aisle -- it was founded by Welsh settlers in 1846, when, as Robinson pointed out, weddings were still conducted in parlors -- and its walls were covered, bizarrely, with garish wallpaper. Taking in the room, Robinson said, with great, throaty satisfaction, ''You can really feel the density of presence here.'' ",2004-10-24T19:11:46+0000

He was the husband of Jane M. Harris. Mr. Harris was born in Geneva, NY on April 18, 1920, the son of the late Laura (Houghton) and Ieuan Harris. He attended the 8th grade at Salisbury School and completed four years at The Hotchkiss School, graduating with the class of 1938. Entering Yale University in the fall of 1938, he graduated with his class in 1942, having majored in Spanish. Entering the military shortly thereafter, he completed O.C.S., graduating as a 2nd Lt. Infantry, in the Army. He trained extensively with the 10th Mountain Division at Camp Hale, Colorado, and he was severly wounded while participating in an action in the Aleutian Islands.

The program identified about 12,000 charities in the state that were delinquent in filing annual tax returns, financial statements and other information required of nonprofit groups in New York. Failure to provide timely and complete filings limits the state's ability to monitor charities and deprives it of the fees that charities pay when they make their filings. Those fees help cover the cost of nonprofit oversight. Mr. Spitzer's office estimated that more careful monitoring of charity filings would generate an additional $70,000 in fee revenue annually, which it said would, in turn, improve oversight.

Dr. Jacobs held four Polytechnic degrees, and was founder and board chairman of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., an international engineering and construction firm based in Pasadena, CA. His humanitarian endeavors included the establishment of the Jacobs Family Foundation to promote community-based economic development, aid families and youths at risk and provide educational and other opportunities to underrepresented groups. In 2002, in recognition of his selfless dedication to his alma mater, Polytechnic named its new academic building in his and his wife's honor. The Joseph J. and Violet J. Jacobs Building at Metro Tech Center in downtown Brooklyn, NY, stands as a tribute to the generosity and devotion of the Jacobs family to Polytechnic.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Hoover Medal, which recognizes the civic and humanitarian achievements of professional engineers. Dr. Jacobs was also an accomplished author and published two books, The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur: Family, Culture and Ethics and The Compassionate Conservative: Assuming Responsibility and Respecting Human Dignity.

The painting, ""Woman in White,"" was taken Thursday from the home of Marilynn Alsdorf. Ms. Alsdorf bought it in 1975 from the Stephen Hahn Gallery in Manhattan. At the time neither she nor Mr. Hahn realized that the painting had been stolen by the Nazis, they said. Court papers say that Picasso sold the painting to a Berlin collector, identified only as Mrs. Landsberg, in 1926 or 1927. Around 1938, Mrs. Landsberg sent it to a friend in Paris, J.K. Thannhauser, for safekeeping. But Mr. Thannhauser fled to escape the Nazis in August 1939, and in 1940 the Nazis looted his house. Carol Vogel (NYT)",2004-10-27T05:00:00+0000

My stepsons, who live in the United States, wanted to show off their homeland to their girlfriends, who had accompanied them to Cuba, and Ricardo had offered to drive the four of them and two others to Cienfuegos, 210 miles distant, and Trinidad, 50 miles farther. Ricardo pulled up at noon sharp the next day, four hours late. The first thing the passengers noticed when they opened the trunk was five five-gallon cans of gas sloshing around where a spare tire should have rested. The car had no gas tank, and Ricardo had rigged a plastic siphon from a smaller tank under the dashboard.

us,The Listing; 'HEARTS AND MINDS',"In 1975, just as the last Americans were scrambling out of Saigon, Peter Davis's ""Hearts and Minds"" won the Academy Award for best documentary, causing a minor uproar at the Oscar ceremony. In this wartime season of politically charged documentaries, Mr. Davis's film, produced by Columbia and then abandoned for being too incendiary, returns to theaters to remind us that polemical nonfiction filmmaking was not invented by Michael Moore. Midway through a two-week run at Film Forum (and playing in other cities around the country), ""Hearts and Minds"" does not so much analyze the turmoil of Vietnam as plunge the viewer into it. Interviews with the war's architects, opponents, fighters and victims are presented without narrative or chronological sequence, providing alternating doses of enlightenment and shock. Some of the juxtapositions seem facile and tendentious -- it is hard, 30 years later, to see what football had to do with Vietnam -- but Mr. Davis's angry, unflinching look at the arrogance and cruelty of power remains cogent and dismayingly relevant.

Then, by the late 70's, blood began to flow again, and by the mid-80's, locals who used to call the place Hamp were sliding into NoHo.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   KLARFELD, NEIL C.","KLARFELD--Neil C. Most wonderful husband and father, died with dignity and grace at home with his loved ones around him. A leader in the real estate industry, Neil was a quiet giant known for his integrity and talent as much as his great success. He was a gentle man who had much to brag about, but never did. In the business world, he fulfilled his dream of owning his own company and with The Clarett Group, he built a number of beautiful towers throughout Manhattan. He leaves a magnificent imprint on New York's skyline, but an even taller impression upon all who knew him, especially his family. Neil traveled the world with his childhood sweetheart and wife, Charlette, settling in New York, a City he loved. He was an adoring son who took extraordinary care of his mother and father, and loved to take care of everyone in his life. ""Don't worry, I'll take care of it"" was one of his most favorite sayings. Generous of spirit and with plenty to spare, Neil was a legendary ice cream eater, Yankee fan and wine connoisseur, who most enjoyed his evenings home with his family. He will be loved and missed forever. He is survived by his wife, Charlette, his daughter, Elise, his son, Jonathan, his daughter-in-law, Debbie, his father, Sydney, his sister, Sandra, and his sister-in-law, Debra Shabas Heller. A memorial service will be held today, October 29, at noon at Riverside Chapel. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Neil C.

With ham-fisted bravura he painted big scale, melodramatic adventure narratives that looked as if they had been copied from the covers of pulp fiction paperbacks. Mr. Bosman's current show features medium large pictures of what you might call roadside Americana. Images resemble postcards purchased at upstate historic sites depicting things like Herman Melville's desk, a stone house at Fort Ticonderoga, an ironworker's forge in a log cabin and a place called the Lumberman's Museum. There is in the paintings an almost comically literal correspondence between textures in the imagery -- wood grain, stone and grass -- and the textures of paint on canvas. Avoiding fancy techniques of illusionism and working with wide brushes and a dry, brusque touch, Mr. Bosman asserts a forthright painterly pragmatism that mirrors the dream of heroic, no-nonsense pragmatism evoked by his historic subject matter. The irony is that the things he paints now belong to the tourist industry; they are empty signifiers of a no longer living myth. Mr. Bosman's real subject is a search for America's lost soul.

The composer's new opera, ""Haroun and the Sea of Stories,"" will open on Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater in a production by Mark Lamos with whimsical costumes (above) by Candice Donnelly. Its libretto by the poet James Fenton is adapted from Salmon Rushdie's endearing children's novel of the same name, about a son's journey to rescue his father's vanished gift for telling stories. Mr. Wuorinen's variety of complex and rigorous music once dominated the academic scene, but its marketability to broader audiences has long been questioned. Having a literary source as accessible as ""Haroun"" will certainly help, but this is still an excitingly risky experiment. And if the institution is serious about attracting younger and more adventurous listeners, it is an essential risk worth taking. George Manahan conducts, Peter Strummer is the storyteller Rashid and Heather Buck sings the role of Haroun. (Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570.

And a copy of his first play, ""Vera,"" used by Wilde in rehearsals for its American debut at the Union Square Theater in New York in 1883, fetched $92,000. That is a sharp turnaround from 1907, when, after Wilde's imprisonment for homosexuality, and his death in bankruptcy and disgrace, Sotheby's sold the very same copy for 26.

But on opening night, Mr. Muti was conspicuously absent. The stated reasons were that Covent Garden had had to modify the sets slightly to comply with local safety regulations, that the stage director, Hugo de Ana, considered his vision compromised, and that Mr. Muti withdrew in solidarity. English critics were left wondering why anyone would make such a fuss about what turned out to be a rather uninteresting, conservative production.

Republicans and Democrats alike have already put the nation on notice that they will not accept anything short of a resounding defeat as the final word in this election, which suggests that the legal tangle of 2000 was not the aberration that many of us assumed it was but, rather, a redefinition of the presidential campaign itself. Just as candidates have in recent years found ways to kick off their campaigns in stages so they can garner more attention (first the exploratory committee, then the campaign committee, then the official announcement), so too are they now poised to shut down those campaigns just as gradually, beginning with the voting itself and ending with the Supreme Court's rejection of one last, desperate brief.",2004-10-31T05:00:00+0000

Speculation about Reagan running for president began following what became known as ""the speech."" During the next decade, Reagan's national political profile grew - and so did speculation about a presidential bid. On November 8, 1966, Reagan defeated Edmund ""Pat"" Brown, the two-term incumbent, for the governorship of California by a million-vote margin. In 1968, he became a ""favorite son"" candidate for the Republican nomination for president, briefly challenging Richard Nixon at the convention in Miami Beach, Florida. On November 3, 1970, he was reelected California's governor by defeating Assemblyman Jesse Unruh by a half-million votes. In 1972, he actively campaigned on behalf of President Richard Nixon's reelection effort. When he stepped down as governor of California in January 1975, Reagan was a seasoned political figure who was widely considered to be a future Republican presidential nominee.

""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Eighty-Eights/Columbia), with Hank Jones and Richard Davis -- they were billed as the Great Jazz Trio -- was one of the last recordings the drummer Elvin Jones made before his death last May.

The pianist Hank Jones, Elvin's brother, is a neat, genial pragmatist in his music, not given to grandiosity. Elvin was the opposite: any music he touched became darker and more profound. This album, with Richard Davis on bowed and plucked bass, defines them both.

A former director of Steinhardt's School Psychology Program, Ester studied children's struggles to regulate their behavior and published her findings in academic journals and books. Ester brought passion, energy, and caring into her classes and into the lives of those with whom she worked. She mentored hundreds of students and was a dear friend to many.
