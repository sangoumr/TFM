The President, the Board of Trustees and entire Montefiore Medical Center community deeply mourn the death of our dear friend and supporter, Jerome L. Greene. A devoted and active trustee since 1972, he had an extraordinary impact on the quality of health and life of thousands of Montefiore patients and residents of the Bronx and Westchester. Combining his skills as a lawyer with his belief in Montefiore as an instrument of social responsibility, he led the medical center in the founding, 18 years ago, of the Mosholu Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit community development support corporation that has, with his guidance, saved housing, revitalized neighborhoods and created innovative projects such as moderate income housing, a community newspaper that serves 15,000 households, the first and only NYC business improvement district sponsored under the auspices of an academic institution, a vast program of graffiti removal and a youth job training program-all of which have played a role in the Bronx's nationally recognized resurgence. He believed in the crucial role of academic medical centers such as Montefiore in advancing the health of communities through research, education and provision of high-quality care, and with his beloved wife, Dawn, he helped Montefiore create the Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion, a state-of-the-art building that opened in 1997 offering a full range of general and specialty services in an ambulatory care setting. More recently, he and his wife have been generous benefactors of The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, scheduled to open in 2001. In 1991, at its annual Celebrate Montefiore dinner dance, the medical center honored this remarkable man of vision and commitment for his exemplary stewardship. This year, Montefiore nominated him for the United Hospital Fund's 1999 Distinguished Community Service Award. The medical center has lost one of its greatest friends. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his loving wife, Dawn, and their entire family. Spencer Foreman, MD, President Jay B.

He was long associated with Temple Israel of the City of New York, and after moving to Texas, he and his wife, Rena, became members of Congregation Beth Israel in Austin. He served as a pilot in WWII, flying with the B-24 ''Our Baby'' crew, which he considered his ''second family,'' in the 453rd Bomb Group, 2nd Air Division of the 8th Air Force. He elected to stay in the Air Force reserve, without remuneration, ''because it was his civic duty.'' Eventually promoted to Colonel, he completed his service as Commander of the 9212th Air Reserve Squadron in New York City. He headed his own advertising agency, and was a past President of the League of Advertising Agencies in New York City. A member of the New York Fencers Club, he served on its Board of Governors.

One of the latest is endermologie, which involves wearing a white nylon jump suit while a technician massages afflicted areas with a vacuum hose hooked up to a machine that resembles Woody Allen's orgasmatron. Women are blocking out appointments at doctors' offices and beauty salons for the 35-minute sessions, which cost up to $120 each. How does it profess to diminish puffiness, dimpling and other unmentionables? Dr. Jeffrey Brande, a plastic surgeon who offers the procedure in his offices on the Upper West Side, says it increases blood flow to cellulite-ridden areas, improving their appearance. Researchers like Dr. Bruce Shack of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who examined the effects of endermologie on pigs, have attributed these results to increased circulation and collagen production, but they don't know how long the effects will last. The proof is in the posterior, which takes a while to assess; at least 16 to 20 visits are needed to show results. MARTHA McCULLY",1999-06-06T05:00:00+0000

He held BS and MS degrees from New York University, and was one of the first religious school teachers certified by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He was long associated with Temple Israel of the City of New York, and after moving to Texas, he and his wife, Rena, became members of Congregation Beth Israel in Austin. He served as a pilot in WWII, flying with the B-24 ''Our Baby'' crew, which he considered his ''second family,'' in the 453rd Bomb Group, 2nd Air Division of the 8th Air Force. He elected to stay in the Air Force reserve, without remuneration, ''because it was his civic duty.'' Eventually promoted to Colonel, he completed his service as Commander of the 9212th Air Reserve Squadron in New York City. He headed his own advertising agency, and was a past President of the League of Advertising Agencies in New York City. A member of the New York Fencers Club, he served on its Board of Governors. Most important to him however, was serving civic organizations dedicated to helping others, and he gave generously of his time-a past President and Trustee of New York Lodge No. 1, B'nai B'rith; a member of ADL's National Commission; past Chairman of the ADL New York Regional Board; past Chairman of the Board of the Metropolitan Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty; a member of the Management Assistance Program of UJA-Federation of NY; and a past President of the New York Society for the Deaf.

Born August 15, 1899, Mrs. Meek not only watched but participated in some of the world-changing events of the last century. As head of the Greenwich, CT, Foreign Relief Committee during World War II, she spearheaded the effort to send thousands of tons of clothing and medical supplies in the famous Bundles for Britain war effort. She also was an active member of the Red Cross Motor Corps of Greenwich during the war and showed great compassion toward those less fortunate with her efforts over the course of 30 years as a member of the Refugee Committee of Christ Church. Through her work, hundreds of refugees were housed and employed. Born in 1899 in Stonington, CT, to Ormesby McKnight and Elizabeth Philips Mitchel, she married Samuel Williams Meek, who would become an advertising legend, on October 14, 1921. Mr. Meek, a Vice President at the J. Walter Thompson Company, oversaw a huge 39-year foreign expansion at the company, with Mrs. Meek beside him all the way. After years abroad with JWT, they settled in Greenwich, where Mrs. Meek continued her passion for good works and the outdoors, becoming a grand dame of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and an active member of the Audubon Society. Her husband, who died in 1981, served on the board of the Connecticut Bank & Trust Company and was elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PORTER, H. BOONE","PORTER-H. Boone. The Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Crowds are showing up for frosty drinks at the tiny juice bar, and because it's on a bleak stretch of Lafayette Street, at No. 371 near Great Jones Street, it's far enough from neighbors for music to blast day and night. ''It's a rock-and-roll juice bar,'' said Russell Jebbia (above), who opened Love Juice in an old gas-station kiosk in December. Mr. Jebbia, who once owned a SoHo boutique called the Eye, recently set up chairs outside Love Juice, creating an impromptu street scene. It is open daily from noon until 8 P.M., except Thursday through Saturday, when patrons keep it open until 10 or 11. Artists, musicians and locals stop by for chilled chai tea, guarana sodas, custom smoothies, what the menu calls ''hyper-caffeinated shock coffee'' and recorded music of bands like Massive Attack and Space Hog. ''It's a fantastic people-watching joint,'' said Jonny Cragg, Space Hog's drummer. ''I often swing by for Strawberry Speedballs. Russell always adds lots of love to his juice.''

With more than a dozen murders, assorted dismemberments and the emperor Saturninus sitting down to a pie made from the bodies of his stepsons, ''Titus'' is Shakespeare's goriest play and, many critics feel, his worst.

The story faithfully follows the two lovers, who open a popular cafe in turn-of-the-century Vienna. MacDonald, in particular, makes the most of her role, as opposed to the kittenish performance of Ms. Neagle, and Eddy makes a stalwart lover. The musical theme is the popular ''I'll See You Again,'' and Coward's candy-box score suits this lavish production. The question is why Hollywood waited so long - Tuesday at 6 P.M. on Turner Classic Movies. Howard Thompson",1999-06-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; There's No Substitute for Fieldwork,"The pioneering Polish ethnographer Bronislaw Malinowski had an ambivalent attitude toward photography, which, he said, ''I hate above all other things.'' Yet he photographed extensively as part of his fieldwork in Kiriwina, one of the largest of the Trobriand Islands in the South Pacific. Beginning in 1914, Malinowski documented in five monographs, including the classic ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific,'' the beliefs, rituals and quotidian habits of the islanders. With great aggravation, he lugged around his ungainly photographic equipment -- a monstrous cross on the Golgotha of life.'' Nonetheless, Malinowski found photography to be an indispensible tool and took more than 1,000 pictures of the gardeners and animists whose traditional sula -- the inter-island trade of shells and other goods -- became, in academic settings, a widely used paradigm of traditional economic exchange. ''No other anthropologist of Malinowski's generation made photographs work so hard,'' Michael W. Young writes in MALINOWSKI'S KIRIWINA: Fieldwork Photography 1915-1918 (University of Chicago, $40). Nearly 200 previously unpublished photographs are arranged in 14 visual essays with headings like ''Magic'' and ''Mortuary Rites and Exchanges.'' Perhaps the most alluring sequence is ''Masawa Canoes and the Kula Quest,'' which depicts rituals associated with the shell trade and the construction of the islanders' boats, with their graceful sails of dried pandanus leaves sewn with awls of flying fox bone. Undoubtedly, this book will be of primary interest to those in the social sciences, but the engagingly written text and colorful quotations from Malinowski's letters, diaries and books will make it a pleasure for the general reader. Young, senior fellow in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University, makes the point that his book is, in many ways, less an objective study of the islanders than a portrait of Malinowski and ''his vision of his Trobriand world.''

Yet the barely adolescent Clara Bow ''spent hours imitating'' Pickford before a mirror, according to Bow's biographer, David Stenn.

It's territory populated with good ol' boys down on their bad ol' luck. Franklin, a son of Alabama who has never felt at home there, brings together an engaging collection of sympathetic losers caught in tough situations and almost-interesting jobs. A series of bad bets turns a factory foreman into his bookie's indentured servant. An alcoholic who lives off his successful younger brother is asked to do little bro' a favor: kill his sister-in-law's cats while she's on vacation. A ground-water contamination inspector, instead of shutting down a leaky gas station, conspires with the owner to cover up the mess in exchange for the pump jockey's stuffed dead rhino. In this last story, ''Dinosaurs,'' Franklin takes a Southern cliche -- the chain-smoking, oily-overall-wearing cinder-block station owner -- and turns him into a memorable character with just a few lines of dialogue. The old man answers the young inspector's remark about doing good for the environment with an incredulous snap: ''The environment?'' he says. ''Take you a good long look out the window yonder at the environment.'' With all these bad husbands, ne'er-do-well buddies and frayed marriages, it's as if the author kidnapped Raymond Carver's characters and set them loose in the Deep South. Franklin isn't challenging Carver's mastery yet, but with this satisfying collection he establishes himself as one of the region's more interesting emerging voices.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-13T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-15T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-16T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-18T05:00:00+0000

The sets can be elaborate or austere, incandescent or darkly grim. You could do it in modern dress, or in punk rock regalia or even let the Rhinemaidens slosh around in the river nude.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The More Hairless Ape,"In the rising tide of male vanity, removing back hair may no longer be unusual, but now salons around town are depilating men with a fresh eye to detail. The treatments use wax and lasers to denude feet, hands and ears by coating hirsute areas with a thin film of warm wax, covering it with a piece of linen and then --argh! -- ripping it all off. At the Frederic Fekkai Beauty Salon (Fifth Avenue and 57th Street), an ear waxing is $16. The Oscar Blandi Salon at the Plaza (Fifth Avenue and Central Park South) provides a $75 package for waxing hands and feet. ''Forty percent of our customers are men,'' said Cindy Barshop, owner of Completely Bare, a spa on Madison Avenue (65th Street) that specializes in hair removal. ''A lot of executives and N.F.L. players come in for laser hair removal on their hands and feet.'' At the spa, whose clientele includes Stephen Baldwin and Howard Stern, laser treatments for small body parts are $150 a session, while waxing runs from $20 to $25. ''In the past, men were forced to do stuff like this in secrecy,'' said Mitch Marrow, a defensive lineman for the Carolina Panthers who lives in New York.

Jeremiah Johnson, 24, is a hip-hop lover who is not keen on velour's comeback. ''It reminds me of when I was a kid, but I don't think I could ever rock the suit again,'' he said.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Brave New World,"In 1900 the United States was still a nation whose artists, writers and social circles looked to Europe for inspiration and validation. When the country came of age, it did so amid the turmoil of two world wars, economic depression and the deafening clamor of industrialization. With THE AMERICAN CENTURY: Art and Culture 1900-1950 (Whitney Museum of American Art/Norton, cloth, $60; paper $40), Barbara Haskell has managed to create a remarkably seamless narrative of that era of disjunction and flux. Featuring supplementary essays by scholars of various arts, this survey of American cultural history places everything from tea sets by Tiffany to the color-field paintings of Mark Rothko, from the Gibson Girl to ''Citizen Kane,'' in historical context. Haskell, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, shows how more than 1,000 wildly disparate works of art are in fact closely related to one another, all made either to document or to retreat from a new world of machines, stock markets, dust bowls and neon lights. What emerges is a portrait of a nation alternating between pitiful disillusionment and glorious confidence, always anxious to construct for itself a mythical history and a monumental identity. This book is no less a product of such anxiety than the cultural artifacts discussed therein; in its grandiose ambition to incorporate as much as possible within its fold while assigning all things a logical place, ''The American Century'' is itself a testament to this country's compulsion to assemble the fragments of its past into cohesive form.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Glamourbrat,"Diane Leslie's first novel, FLEUR DE LEIGH'S LIFE OF CRIME (Simon & Schuster, $23), offers a delicious and disturbing glimpse behind the high stucco walls of Hollywood, circa 1957. In one canyon dwelling, 10-year-old Fleur de Leigh competes with studio executives, fans and artwork for the attention of her parents. But her mother, Charmian, is busy plotting her move beyond ''The Charmian Leigh Radio Mystery Half-Hour'' and such movie credits as ''Ivan the Marriageable'' and ''Divorcee Ole!'' Her father, Maurice, lately ''reduced to producing television,'' shows more concern for his Cadillac and his ''authentic'' police badge than for his daughter. Left to a rotating cast of nannies, whose names serve as chapter titles, Fleur narrates her search for love from parental substitutes such as Glendora, ''too fat to be anything but a supporting character,'' ''glamour puss'' Bettina and the silent-era star Thea Roy. When one nanny -- an escaped mental patient -- tries to corner Fleur for surgery, only the bare-chested Moldavian gardener, Constantine, intervenes. Constantine relieves Fleur's loneliness with such commands as ''Fleur Leigh, put bathing suit on. Is going on sprinklers.'' But it's a tough coming of age for a girl dropped off at ''psychodrama'' workshops and ogled by tourists. Leslie -- who clearly knows the Hollywood she lampoons -- balances the sincerity of Fleur's narration with the superficiality of her surroundings, eliciting shivers of compassion. The antics can border on the slapstick, and the reader misses follow-ups to cameo appearances by cops, game-show contestants and a grandmother. But then so does Fleur, a heroine forced to make the most of her placement on maps of the stars. Nina Sonenberg",1999-06-20T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-20T05:00:00+0000

Some in the movement were not certain that painting could match Breton's ''pure psychic automatism'' of verbal expression, which he described as going beyond the constraints of reason and ''beyond any aesthetic or moral preoccupation.'' After a couple of years, painting that engaged in automatism and courted dreams squeaked through the Surrealist door as well.

Both were fertile collaborations with the director Stephen Frears -- bright, pop evocations of a London miles off the tourist map, a world of gay and biracial sex, squatters and drugs.

More than 50 kinds of arisaemas -- called jack-in-the-pulpit in North America -- rocket from the soil, and one, Arisaema nepenthoides, stands fully erect, a single cobralike spathe beside a rotting stump crowned with ferns. Thirty-five varieties of Solomon's seals, or polygonatums, from China, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal and Sikkim unspiral from their early growth, and dozens of types of hellebore have just passed their prime. Throughout the garden, hydrangeas and viburnums are beginning to dispense their leaves; Stachyurus and Edgeworthia, winter-flowering shrubs from Asia, are leafing out.

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-21T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-22T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-23T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PORTER, H. BOONE","PORTER-H. Boone. The Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  PORTER, H. BOONE","PORTER-H. Boone. The Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-26T05:00:00+0000

Chang's China Bistro has replaced the Brooklyn Diner at the Source, 1504 Old Country Road, in Westbury (222-9200). Although Chang's menu is Chinese, its soul and spirit are American. The American heartland mind-set of this Arizona-based chain is revealed in its menu descriptions and the approach of its servers. Pork dumplings are described as Peking raviolis, even though ravioli is not a best seller in Peking. No doubt someone at the corporate office thought Americans would understand the reference. The restaurant's American spin is also evident and much appreciated at dessert time, when splendid versions of Western favorites like cheesecake and chocolate and pear tortes, rather than the stock canned pineapples, kumquats almond cookies and pistachio ice cream, are offered. Less appreciated is the obviously programmed patter of the non-Chinese waiters (there was not an Asian face at Chang's on the staff or among the diners during my visits) that starts with the sauce ceremony in which the waiter solemnly explains the use of soy sauce, mustard, vinegar and chili paste. That might play in Peoria but for New Yorkers who grew up eating Chinese food, a pedantic lecture about how one mixes mustard into soy sauce is unnecessary and a little silly. Additionally, our earnest waiter asked us if ''everything was all right'' and if we ''were enjoying the food'' about every 10 minutes while water glasses remained unfilled and dirty dishes remained uncleared.",1999-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Beast With Two Books,"Elephants have had an extraordinary pull on the human imagination since the Stone Age, a fact made abundantly clear in ELEPHANTS: A Cultural and Natural History (Konemann, $39.95), by Karl Groning and Martin Saller. Combining a crammed though somewhat haphazardly organized text with stunning illustrations and photographs, the book chronicles the evolution of elephants and their history in folklore, myth, commerce and the arts. There is much that amazes -- elephants can run up to 25 miles an hour, eat up to 375 pounds of vegetation a day, are as intelligent as dolphins and go out of their way to avoid stepping on small creatures in their path -- though perhaps only the most ardent enthusiasts will thrill to learn that an elephant's appendix is five feet long and small intestine 82 feet long. The book unflinchingly reports human abuse of these beguiling animals, a grim record stretching from ancient Rome, where elephants were pitted in amphitheaters against starving lions and leopards, to the 20th century, when hunting for sport and ivory caused a dramatic decline in the elephant population, from five million at the end of the last century to around 500,000 today. AFRICAN ELEPHANTS (Abrams, $49.50) is a revised edition of the wildlife photographer Reinhard Kunkel's 1982 book, ''Elephants,'' which combines glorious photographs with vignettes drawn from many years tracking his quarry across the savannas of eastern Africa. The impressionistic text is clearly written by a man who loves his work, whether he's watching his subjects take dust baths or peering at the scarab beetles that scurry about an elephant's dung (an adult drops about 200 pounds daily). The photographs range from striking vistas of adult and baby elephants rumbling through the wilderness to tender close-ups that focus on a small patch of weathered skin or the creature's absurdly delicate eyelashes. There is a sadness at the heart of this homage, however, which takes full note of the depredations and loss of habitat that have doomed the elephant to a marginal existence.Scott Veale",1999-06-27T05:00:00+0000

This year, it's the cushion cut -- a diamond that looks like a big plump cushion, with a rectangular girdle, curved sides and rounded corners. An older style cut that marries the emerald-cut shape with the fire of a brilliant round diamond, cushion cuts are also desirable because they're hard to find. ''Years ago, everyone had to have a pear-shaped diamond engagement ring,'' Carol Brodie, a vice president at Harry Winston, said. ''Ten years ago, it was round. Now it's all about the family of geometric shapes, square cuts, emerald cuts and cushion cuts.'' Timelessness and bliss are costly.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; What Do I Owe You?,"In A VAUDEVILLE OF DEVILS: 7 Moral Tales (Delacorte, $24.95), his seductive new story collection, Robert Girardi offers seven post-modern parables that range wildly over space and time. Taken together, they reveal the ethical predicaments of a Nazi SS officer, a knight, a computer geek, a deep-sea diver, a vintner, a public defender and a translator. Girardi sifts through his characters' doubts and demons while mapping complex cultural terrain. From the expatriate community in Yemen, where a German cabaret singer tries to erase his past, to the boardroom of a Seattle start-up poised for an acquisition by a Japanese company, the international backdrops contribute to a sense of confused identity and conflicted duty. Questions about what we owe others -- our children, our neighbors, even our ancestors and our gods -- haunt the book and lend it an insistent apocalyptic tone. The stories tell of the temptations of power and authority, as well as the real-life costs of empathy and compassion. Here, the normal rules seem inadequate. When a desperate attorney lands a big case defending an especially heinous member of the Russian Mafia, he gains much-needed confidence by engaging in profound self-delusion. And when a middle-aged Neapolitan countess lusts after an aimless American, she embroiders a beastly fiction in order to trap him. Girardi, a skilled storyteller whose novels include ''Madeleine's Ghost'' and ''Vaporetto 13,'' writes sensuous prose that unapologetically invokes the supernatural. Although moral in theme, these frank, erotic tales are never moralistic. Illustrating the compromises that ordinary people make gradually, almost imperceptibly, ''A Vaudeville of Devils'' exposes the subtle art of the Faustian bargain.",1999-06-27T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-27T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-28T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-29T05:00:00+0000

Boone Porter, one of the Episcopal Church's most influential priests and thinkers and whose many achievements include the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer, died on Saturday, June 5. An author, artist, educator and philanthropist, he was 76 and lived in Southport, Connecticut. The vision of the Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter's 44 years of ordained ministry aimed to revitalize the Episcopal Church through education, liturgical reform and inclusion of its marginalized members. His work of raising up new leadership, enriching Christian worship and creating a central place for women, Afro-and Native Americans and rural communities in the Church was often opposed but succeeded in redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships within itself and with the world. The Rev. Ralph McMichael, a noted professor at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, Wis., recently commented: '' Dr. Porter's ministry has been, and continues to be, so rich and varied that it is hard to designate his legacy in the Episcopal Church in one or two ways. He is liturgical scholar, professor, pastor, editor and missioner. He has shaped our liturgy, our parishes, our prayer book, our publications and our view of ministry and mission of the Church. A descendant of the family of early American explorers, the Boones, Dr. Porter was born in Louisville, KY into a prosperous business family (his father founded the Porter Pain Company) and showed an early interest in the beauty and mystery of nature and humanity. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, NH and his study of art and philosophy at Yale College in the 1940's was interrupted by World War II. He fought in the Pacific Theater, where he served with Army Intelligence during General MacArthur's campaign to retake the Philippines and occupy Japan. After the war, Dr. Porter completed his studies at Yale and entered the Berkeley Divinity School, also in New Haven. There, under the direction of Dr. Edward Hardy, he began his study of liturgy and worship that later became his foremost and world renowned expertise. This led him to read for a doctorate in early Christian baptismal rites at Oxford University in England in 1952. In 1954 he returned to the United States to teach Church History at Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary near Milwaukee, WI. Four years later, Dr. Porter became the first tenured professor of liturgy at General Theological Seminary in New York City, the Episcopal Church's oldest theological seminary. There he served on committees at the Episcopal Church's National Headquarters, 815 Second Avenue and his graduate program liturgy attracted and shaped key people in the next generation of Church leadership.",1999-06-30T05:00:00+0000
