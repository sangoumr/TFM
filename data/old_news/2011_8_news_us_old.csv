Last winter the lead producers of the Broadway revival of Promises, Promises closed the show on Jan. 2 rather than gamble money on recasting their two stars, Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth, and risk a slide in ticket sales. Those same producers are now behind another Broadway revival, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, but they have opted to replace their star, Daniel Radcliffe, who finishes his run as the scheming executive J. Pierrepont Finch on New Years Day. Confirming rumors that have been circulating for a couple of weeks, the producers announced on Monday that Mr. Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame) will be succeeded by a lesser-known actor, Darren Criss, who has become popular recently on the Fox series Glee playing a gay high school student and show choir member who exudes charisma and self-confidence. In casting Mr. Criss the producers are seeking to appeal to at least some of the teenagers, women and gay men who often mob Mr. Radcliffe at the stage door after performances. Mr. Criss is scheduled for only a three-week engagement, Jan. 3 through 22. In their statement announcing Mr. Criss the producers did not say if they plan to cast another actor after him, close the $8.5 million production after he departs, or try to extend his run. A spokesman for the musical said the producers had not made decisions about the future of the show after the Criss run.",2011-08-01T22:11:25+0000

NOAA said the zone measured 6,765 square miles, which is not a record. But scientists warned that the data could be misleading because a tropical storm had roiled and mixed gulf waters.

Its not entirely true that theres no such thing as a pitching prospect, especially when youre talking about players who blew away the high minors like Tim Lincecum and Tommy Hanson or mega-talents like David Price or Stephen Strasburg. But for the next tier down, which is how I view both the Indians and Yankees duos, the failure rate is awfully high.

Retirement of this popular and very visible shuttle program further strains the already diminished agency. Space experts say the best and brightest often head for the doors when rocket lines get marked for extinction, dampening morale and creating hidden threats, according to The Times. This is not the first time in NASAs history when the agency faced publicity troubles. Back in 1974, after the success of the Mercury and Apollo programs, but before the initiation of the Shuttle Program, NASA was convinced by the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in its Federal Graphics Improvement Program, and do what many companies these days do to revive their image: undergo a redesign.Up until that point, NASA had been primarily using an insignia adapted by James Modarelli, the head of NASAs Lewis Research Center Reports Division. This logo, created in 1959 and affectionately dubbed The Meatball, relied heavily on multiple visual metaphors. According to NASAs Web site, the sphere represents a planet, the stars represent space, the red chevron is a wing representing aeronautics (the latest design in hypersonic wings at the time the logo was developed), and then there is an orbiting spacecraft going around the wing. Although charming in its quirkiness, the meatball proved difficult to reproduce given the printing technology available at the time and the variety of applications it would need to adorn.",2011-08-03T10:36:20+0000

He said he was told that calls would be about $2 a minute and that there would be no extra charges for data as he was on an unlimited plan. The latter part turned out to be wrong.

To finance his growth, Mr. Justice kept borrowing money from the bank, not realizing that the more he grew, the more he needed to borrow because his revenue was not covering his expenses. The loans meant he had money in his accounts  but it was borrowed money. I knew how to print a financial statement from QuickBooks, but I couldnt tell you what it meant, he said.

us,The Weight,"Since their debut record, North Hills, came out two years ago, the Los Angeles-based folk-rock band Dawes has been eliciting breathless comparisons to some pretty illustrious names  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the Eagles, the Band. Partly it has to do with their origin myth: they recorded the album at the renowned producer Jonathan Wilsons studio in Laurel Canyon after playing a run of small hootenannies there. But mostly it has to do with their sound, which has a warm, stripped-down Americana feel frequently described as vintage. Recently, the group got about as big a nod as four guys playing folk rock could hope for: Robbie Robertson, the somewhat reclusive songwriter from the Band, asked them to back him in a series of rare performances. Now in the middle of an East Coast tour to promote their follow-up record, Nothing Is Wrong, which was released this summer, Dawes seems both honored and amused to have been credited with leading a revival of the Laurel Canyon sound.",2011-08-04T13:00:56+0000

Riffing on Rem Koolhaass iconic 1990s book S, M, L, XL, the exhibition focuses on projects that range in size from the micro to the massive, in a mix of built and speculative work. For the site-specific installation, LTL inserted a three-sided container with etched and printed surfaces into a long, narrow gallery space. Visitors entering the container make their way through the exhibition from the largest of the four projects on view to the smallest, walking on a white-painted wood floor that is laser-etched with the plans of each project. Canted walls of backlit panels provide photographs, architectural drawings and descriptive text. Water Proving Ground, at 69 million square feet, is LTLs extra-large project. This visionary master plan for the northwest corner of New York Harbor was conceived as part of MoMA/P.S. 1s recent Rising Currents initiative, which studied the impact of anticipated sea-level change on the city. The other projects in the show are all built works: Arthouse, a contemporary art center in Austin, Tex.; the Sullivan Family Student Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie; and Lobby Wall, a site-specific sculpture for the lobby of Memorial Sloan-Ketterings new Manhattan building, which is the smallest of the projects at 108 square feet.",2011-08-04T15:00:55+0000

us,Poetry for Tough Guys,"Bruce Smiths new poems move fast and travel far, from Newtonian physics to the fiery . . . riderless horse of Christian apocalypse, from the jet engine / as it gins the clouds to the hand-iron press and the sewing machine. Most of those poems, though, begin in one place: a notion of blue-collar manhood, full of rough edges, frustration, defiance and pride. Smiths Vietnam-era draftees, present-day stevedores, touring musicians and Iraq war veterans, along with their black, white, sallow, olive, red, black kids, inspire grand flights, tumultuous catalogs, as in a poem about drought: Wherever there was water  the upended lid of a mayonnaise jar / in the gutter, the gutter, the sober silver puddle, the frenzied lake, / the tear ducts, the dew, the beveled rain  we drank. When Smith is not speeding through such cascades of nouns, he revs up other repetitions: They come like rats. . . . They want to save you. They want to slap you silly. They pet / the kitty. They bring gossip. . . . Theyve got questions for further study. The plural noun to which each They refers is an obscenity most poets would not use.",2011-08-04T18:36:35+0000

Financing and Administering New Yorks New Parks (Tuesday) Creating and maintaining green spaces during a budget crunch is not exactly a walk in the park. An urban oasis designed today is very different from one designed in the days of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux; you need only look at the High Line on the West Side of Manhattan, or Brooklyn Bridge Park, above, at the waters edge in Brooklyn. A planned expansion there is expected to include several buildings of private housing  along with tennis courts, a swimming pool and other amenities  with payments from the buildings used to support the parks operating expenses. On Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. Adrian Benepe, the New York parks commissioner, will discuss the history of the citys parks and some issues surrounding park creation with Alexander D. Garvin, of the Yale School of Architecture, and Catherine Nagel, the executive director of the City Parks Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington. Among the questions: Where will the money come from? What makes a park successful? The talk is part of an Urban Forum series at the museum (Fifth Avenue and 103rd Street) on the citys infrastructure. It costs $12 ($8 for 65+ and students and $6 for members) and requires reservations: (917) 492-3395. Seating will be provided, so theres no need for blankets or lawn chairs, and please, no picnics.

Applied similarly to Manhattan cityscapes and Maine land- and seascapes, his touch is brusque, and his colors range from garish to drab. The invariably modest scale feels claustrophobic, despite the expansive subjects. Emotion is muted.

The Romero-type zombie, very much the dominant form these days, multiplies by contagion, like a virus: it feeds on flesh, and its bite is lethal, so even those semi-fortunate humans who arent wholly devoured, but merely gnawed upon, die and come back as shuffling, hollow-eyed flesh-eaters themselves.",2011-08-05T16:04:11+0000

For five days, the pirates and their hostage drifted in the Indian Ocean, shadowed by the U.S.S. Bainbridge, a destroyer that arrived at the scene not long after the hijacking. At dusk on April 12, Navy snipers killed three of the Somalis, and Phillips was rescued unharmed.

Compared to previous collections, it is slightly more macabre, yet Simmons, now in her fifth season, continues to demonstrate an ability to imbue classic styles with a modern twist. For example, the Edna heel, a reimagined stiletto loafer, is beetle-crusher when its in black and white, she says, and then we did a red and leopard version that has an element of Victoriana.

I was glad to see both on a recent trip, but I was also lucky to spot a sign for another, less-heralded exhibition at the museum. Plastique Ludique (Playful Plastic), which runs until Nov. 6, presents the work of the Czech toy designer Libuse Niklova (1934-1981), whose work with plastics, particularly in the 1960s and 70s, changed the look  and the nature  of toys in her native country. Niklova believed that children should be able to play as creatively as possible, and the development of plastics after World War II offered a helpful tool. Her inflatable buffalo, giraffe and elephant, with their simplified, graphic silhouettes and bright, pop colors, could be used as chairs or pool toys for small children. (The three have been reissued in limited numbers and are for sale at the museums shop.) And Niklovas ingenious use of pleated plastic piping produced animals with accordion-like midsections that squealed when squeezed. In contrast to the Chalayan and Lauren exhibitions, which are about the more expensive pleasures of the material world, Plastique Ludique offers a surprising, refreshing look at a more modest  yet no less inventive  endeavor.",2011-08-11T17:15:53+0000

us,"A Novel of Nigeria, Scotland and the Quest for Perfect Silence","There was once a time, centuries before Internet shopping, when buyers and sellers could honorably carry out their exchanges without ever meeting. In the gold-for-salt commerce of Saharan and Sahel tribes, for example, the Saharans would leave a salt pile by the banks of the Niger, then remove themselves so their clients could, in seclusion, deposit a sum of gold. At that point, the merchants would return, but if the payment was deemed insufficient, they would leave it with the salt and withdraw. The Sahel merchants would approach again, and this good-faith dance of advance and retreat would be repeated until both parties felt content with the deal.",2011-08-12T16:44:33+0000

Novels about wizards outsell (and often outshine) the most glittering literary fiction titles; the contemporary romantic hero generally sports a pair of fangs; and even now the five remaining earthlings who havent read The Lord of the Rings are being hunted down and put to the sword. Yet for all of fantasys successes, there remains a chip on the spaulder of the genre. As Michael Agger put it in 2009, reviewing Lev Grossmans Harry Potter-influenced novel The Magicians: Perhaps a fantasy novel meant for adults cant help being a strange mess of effects. . . . Sounds like fun, but arent we a little old for this? And with that, hundreds of years of fantastical writing are reduced to 20-sided dice, pencil nubs, half-filled Coke cans and the crushing realization that no, your elven rogues dagger is not going to be effective against green slime.",2011-08-12T16:45:10+0000

Love was confined to private life, where only women and novelists and psychoanalysts were supposed to pay much attention to it.

Perhaps that was why I found it irritating; or else it was the suggestion that punk rockers would break bread with someone who had flowers in her hair.

Southwest of the boundary would remain in native control; north and east would be Mayhew territory. The great natural monument, lichen dappled and framed within a modest clearing, always surprises me when I approach it. There are no special signs along the trail.

us,The Making of a Debt Spiral,"DEBT spirals: the term sounds ominous. As it should  these market vortexes are posing grave dangers to the global economy right now. A national debt crisis is a bank run writ large, says Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and co-author with Carmen M. Reinhart of This Time Is Different, a history of financial crises. When a country like Greece goes deep into debt, bond investors start to worry they wont get their money back. What can happen next is a debt spiral, a vicious circle of sinking confidence, rising borrowing costs and, ultimately, rising debt burdens. As investors lose confidence in a country, its bond prices drop, its bond yields rise and its government must pay higher interest rates to borrow. That, in turn, deepens the debt problem  and the whole thing starts over again. Debt spirals are dangerous, but they arent inevitable. Country debt crises are essentially political, Mr. Rogoff says. Governments can often stem the crisis by reducing spending, raising taxes or both. But such steps are particularly difficult  and politically unappetizing  when growth is slack, as it is now in much of the world. Tightening the belt slows growth even more, eroding tax revenue and  you guessed it  increasing the debt burden, at least in the short term. Of course, the best way to avoid a debt spiral is to avoid running up a lot of debt in the first place  when the economy is doing well. If you walk outside without a raincoat and the sun is shining, you are fine, Mr. Rogoff says. But if it starts pouring, you are going to get wet.  <em>DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN</em>",2011-08-13T14:26:02+0000

If theres one thing that recent globally minded art history has taught us, its that after World War II, new art, and lots of it, was turning up in cities everywhere. Los Angeles was one, and in the late 50s, almost to its own surprise, it had a big art moment. That moment, which lasted about a decade, is the subject of Rebels in Paradise: The Los Angeles Art Scene and the 1960s, by Hunter Drohojowska-Philp. The book has much to recommend it: its fast-paced, well researched, accessibly anecdotal. But as an account of a still understudied episode in American postwar culture, its oddly lopsided.

Only subsequently, as a result of protests organized by groups like the Freedom Defense Initiative and Stop Islamization of America, did the project become the subject of passionate debate. It was they who named the community center the ground zero mosque. In the months that followed, other vociferous opponents of the project emerged, among them not only conservative politicians like Newt Gingrich and some of the families of victims of 9/11, but also a number of Muslim leaders, who felt that the choice of site was insensitive and would complicate Muslim relations with the broader community. The controversy gave rise to a media frenzy that reached its height in the late summer of 2010. One imagines that the former New York Times journalist Amy Waldman heard these arguments with a combination of recognition and, perhaps, faint dismay: the general topic of her as yet unpublished first novel, The Submission, was proving disturbingly prescient.

us,Libya: The End and the Beginning,"For months, almost every development out of Libya seemed to confirm my initial pessimism about our quasi-war against Muammar Qaddafi. But happily thats changed in the last week, with the sudden collapse of his regime and the apparent victory of the rebels. As in post-Saddam Iraq and post-Taliban Afghanistan, many of the scenarios for what comes next in Libya could ultimately pose as many risks to American interests as Qaddafi himself ever did, and I agree with all the voices pointing out that the tyrants fall doesnt necessarily vindicate our intervention, to say nothing of the dubiously legal means by which America was taken to war in North Africa. But I also think its important for critics of the war to acknowledge the significance of the last few days events. While few intervention skeptics maintained that we could not possibly defeat the regime (as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it), many of us worried that the administrations (understandably) risk-averse approach to the conflict might create a permanent stalemate, leaving an armed-and-dangerous Qaddafi in power in Tripoli while Western warplanes circled impotently overhead. Qaddafis defeat doesnt necessarily promise a happy outcome in the long run, but at the very least it guarantees that we will be spared that particular worst-case scenario, while holding out the possibility of a Libya unified and at peace  rather than a Libya partitioned and perpetually patrolled by Western forces, which is where we seemed to be headed a month ago. Declarations of victory are ridiculously premature, but for a country and a White House starved for any sort of good news, the fall of Qaddafi should because for (suitably restrained) celebration.",2011-08-24T18:59:19+0000

Failure gives baseball its pleasing, melancholic tang; the boys of summer are always in ruin, after all, and the dirge of the Cubs forever drowns out the anthem of the Yankees. It seems somehow fitting that one of the worst diseases imaginable is named after one of the greatest baseball players.

Note the Updikean judiciousness of important: he didnt say he liked the book, but it was a great cultural bellwether as novels go, and it has endured. Despite mixed reviews on publication in 1961, Catch-22 was soon adopted by college students who recognized a kindred spirit in Yossarian, the bombardier who rebels against a materialistic bureaucracy hellbent on killing him. Better Yossarian than Rotarian became a popular slogan, all the more so with the timely (for the novels sake) military escalation in Vietnam, which became the real subject of Catch-22 and partly accounts for its sales of more than 10 million copies to date.

The book is structured around Jillettes alternatives to the Ten Commandments (take the Lords name in vain all you want, but be sure to say what you mean, even when talking to yourself), but we also get reminiscences about his moderately Congregationalist childhood in Massachusetts, his conflicted admiration for Siegfried and Roy, and the atheist baptisms held at his Las Vegas home, the Slammer, which tend to involve lots of bacon, nude cornstarch wrestling and a fat Elvis impersonator. We also learn some good post-show lobby pickup lines: he laughed hardest at the woman who asked, Is your name Debbie? but married the one who started talking about Richard Dawkins.

Its heavy in the cornerstone classics of music, says the Jams curator, Sean Hanratty, of the list, which includes Leonard Cohen and the Clash. Its full of the timeless stuff that you never really lose, the records you own and would never part with. Faithfulls first hit, As Tears Go By (1964), which Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham helped write, remains one of the best ballads of all time. The song, along with her highly publicized relationship with Jagger, put her on the map as one of rocks biggest stars. You Cant Always Get What You Want, on the Stones album Let It Bleed, released in 1969, was one of many songs written about Faithfull. I think some people forget  certainly not me  that she also co-wrote Sister Morphine,  says Hanratty of the track on the Stoness 1971 Sticky Fingers album. (The song is reportedly about her life and battles with drug abuse, specifically heroin.) For the past five decades, we have seen Faithfull reinvent herself as a performer and musician, in collaborations with the likes of David Bowie, Tom Waits, Emmylou Harris, Nick Cave and others, while keeping her place as one of the most influential female singer-songwriters of all time. With the impending hurricane and Virginias earthquake, we are kind of in need of the classics, Hanratty says.

While the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington today upheld the validity of two Star patents, the panel said there was no need to retry the infringement case against Reynolds that Star lost in 2009. Judge Randall Rader said in the 2-to-1 opinion that a new trial would not change the outcome as there was substantial untainted evidence before the jury to support a verdict of noninfringement. The patents cover a curing process that prevents bacterial activity in tobacco leaves, resulting in the lowest levels of cancer-causing nitrosamines, according to Star.

Initiated by an executive order issued by President John F. Kennedy, the Peace Corps Act was passed in 1961, instituting an army of volunteers to aid those in developing countries. Sensing an opportunity right in line with SeaVeess revisionist design philosophy and midcentury aesthetic, Tiller and his business partner, Derek Galkin, began sifting through old photos of Peace Corps volunteers. On their feet? Narrow plimsolls, a common canvas and rubber sneaker for that era. The idea was to go back in time, reimagine these shoes and hopefully make them cooler, Tiller said. The resulting slim-lined sneaker in salt-washed canvas has a contrast suede stripe around its rims and a distinct vintage look.
