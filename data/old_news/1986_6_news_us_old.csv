If the Tony winners and losers seem beside the point, it's not completely Broadway's fault. The world became a stage in the season's waning weeks, with a gruesome vengeance that might upstage any play. One could well feel silly and irrelevant going about one's business attending the theater while the front pages screamed of terrorism, of nuclear disaster, or the willful forgetting of the past by the man who would be president of the country where Hitler was born. In such a civilization - or absence of same - does one stay home to watch the late-breaking news and brood, or go off to see the most profusely nominated Tony contender, ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''?",1986-06-01T05:00:00+0000

Much to the outrage of the community, we tore the house down.'' Not a surprising decision, given Levy's penchant for building new homes.

Plants were her earliest and most faithful companions; she looked into them as deep and hard as only a child can, and she never forgot what she learned. Of each she remembered the mode and the imprint, as well as the way it behaved in garden society. The gardens she liked least were the ones she herself had to make from scratch; she entered fully into the atmosphere of gardens already existing, complete with their animals and insects. Each crumbling wall, with its rampant stragglers and tangled blooms attended by ragged butterflies, worked its way into her memory.",1986-06-01T05:00:00+0000

Moreover, ABC is offering this documentary at 7 o'clock tonight, a respectable hour for viewing. This critic does not have the slightest idea how programming like this came to pass - perhaps it is an impulse by Capital Cities, ABC's new management - but whatever the reason it is entirely refreshing.

Nor has their strain died out. It is also a fact of life that despite all the efforts of the trade publishers, some of the best reading on the subject of the fine arts today is to be found in learned periodicals, where the general reader rarely seeks it out. It would be hard, for instance, to find writing about art more eloquent than Rainer Maria Rilke's ''Letters on Cezanne'' or a combination of scholarship and detection that could compare with Yvonne Hackenbroch's ''Reinhold Vasters, Goldsmith.'' But the Rilke is all text and no pictures, and the Hackenbroch comes in Volume 19/20 of the ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' just published.

There were no advance news stories, no radio appearances, and little of the fraternal support aficionados traditionally lend to new music events. Yet Town Hall was almost full, with an audience seemingly made up of students, artists and musicians, and the 55-minute work - a succession of shimmering, ethereal aural colors propelled by a steady pulse - was followed by a stomping, cheering ovation.

But, in the production at the Louis Abrons Arts for Living Center, Abbey Lincoln and Clebert Ford endow these people with extraordinary emotional power. And Bill Harris has given his story some mythic overtones: There is no self-pity in the characters, nor do they blame others for the suffering they slowly acknowledge to one another; the man is angrily defying God and the woman is trying to overcome a grief she can admit is there only by tricking the man into forcing her to tell him about it.

Similarly, Clyde Bernhardt's career and his memoirs recall the world of jazz almost from its beginnings. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a mine foreman in North Carolina. Clyde, born in 1905, was one of eight children, two of whom died in infancy. ''My memory goes back to the famous singers I knew or saw,'' he wrote in the introduction to his book: ''Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Princess White, Mamie Smith and a few the history books don't remember. I heard Bessie Smith, whose husband was a first cousin to the wife of my uncle, sing in North Carolina in 1918. I been in many orchestras - jazz, swing, dance and society bands.'' In the excerpts that follow, he tells, first, of his stint in 1931 with Joseph (King) Oliver (1885-1938), a trumpeter and bandleader who was one of the earliest New Orleans jazzmen and Louis Armstrong's mentor. In the second part, Bernhardt recounts his experiences in 1942 with Jay (Hootie) McShann (1909 - ) the Kansas City pianist whose swing band was home on and off to Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, the alto saxophonist who was to become one of the founders of be-bop and the avant-garde in jazz.

The British unsurprisingly retain their lead as world champions of horticultural articulation, strewing clever, fresh advice and Latinate species names with the confidence they apply to tying in a clematis. Ah, tradition. FARTHER AFIELD: A Gardener's Excursions. By Allen Lacy. 286 pp. (Farrar, Straus, $17.95.) Allen Lacy, who gardens somewhere in suburban New Jersey, is right up there with Henry Mitchell of Washington and Eleanor Perenyi of Stonington, Conn., as America's answer to Christopher Lloyd, the proprietor of Great Dixter in Sussex, England, a writer who is read for his wit as well as his wisdom. ''Home Ground,'' Mr. Lacy's first published collection, placed him among that admirable elite who elevate the pleasant pastime of writing personally and with firm opinions about their private gardens into something that approaches literature. If Mr. should explain why. He has gone farther afield indeed, visiting professional growers, mail-order houses and vast estates in Costa Rica, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Majorca and elsewhere on assignments for assorted publications. Garden journalism is a curious hybrid. Mr. Lacy was more interesting and original when he stayed home and mused on the transience of his columbines. The productive half of ''Farther Afield'' has Mr. Lacy watching his quinces, lifting his lily tubers, considering his fritillaries, relenting on his soapworts (a close call) and succumbing to the hosta craze ''after a lifetime of indifference.''",1986-06-01T05:00:00+0000

us,HE IS A CAMERA,"THE LAST FILM OF EMILE VICO By Thomas Gavin. 403 pp. New York: Viking. $17.95. THIS complex, ambitious and sometimes surreal second novel by Thomas Gavin has as many layers as an onion - a description that also perfectly suits the brilliant auteur, Emile Vico, as he is perceived by the narrator, his cameraman, Griswold Farley. At first, the novel appears to be a murder mystery set in 1930's Hollywood, with an ambiance as authentic as a reel of Movietone News. But more is going on here than the disappearance of a famous author/director/star and the subsequent police investigation of Vico's beautiful, estranged second wife, Lisa, and Farley. Was it murder, suicide, or was the actor -as one old-timer suggests - simply eaten up by the camera? (''Want to find Vico? . . . Look in that last can of film.'') Is Farley himself the killer, or is it his elusive alter ego, the untrustworthy Spyhawk? Or is there some more serious hidden meaning here?",1986-06-01T05:00:00+0000

GARRISON KEILLOR, Author of ''Lake Wobegon Days.'' One summer 20 years ago I knew an old lady who had no close relatives and who was afraid of dying alone and unnoticed in the city of St. Paul. She asked me to dinner and after dinner she asked me to write her obituary. I was a good writer, she said, so I'd be able to present her life in an honest, graceful way and also make it succinct for the newspapers. Of course I agreed to do it. She was the first person to consider my talents useful. So I took notes on her recollections of childhood, her career as a social worker, her religious conversion, and wrote it up and stashed it away and went back to college. She died in Oakland, Calif., about eight years later, I think, alone in a hospital. I hadn't been in touch with her for a long time. I looked at the obituary I'd written and was embarrassed by its extravagant antique style; I tried to rework it as fiction, with her as my mother; and finally I put it away where it sits waiting for me now, years later, on my conscience.

I MET Bulat Okudzhava, the author of ''A Taste of Liberty,'' in January 1960 on my first visit to Leningrad. A group of poets from Moscow invited me one evening to the Oktyabr Hotel, where they were to read their new poems. Mr. Okudzhava is both a writer and a singer. To a simple guitar accompaniment, he performed the ballads that were to make him famous when he began singing them in public. We were all spellbound. Mr. Okudzhava was slender, elegant, dark-eyed. Though his performance was low-key, his ballads were full of lyric power. There was a slightly conspiratorial intensity to that evening; the poets present were all young, and their hopes for a freer, more humane Soviet Union were running high. They were not unlike the characters in ''A Taste of Liberty'' - the Decembrists, the young army officers who dreamed of a bright future for Russia in the 1820's, only to be banished or executed when their rebellion was crushed.",1986-06-01T05:00:00+0000

us,THE STAGE: GUNTER GRASS'S 'FLOOD',"IN selecting for its debut production Gunter Grass's play ''Flood,'' the new Project III Ensemble Theater has taken on a considerable challenge and, it is gratifying to report, has acquitted itself admirably. This parable of a house threatened by destruction, which Mr. Grass wrote three decades ago, when his native Germany was still recovering from the destruction of World War II, bears the marks more of a speculative than of a dramatic bent. ''Flood'' is no exemplar of a well-made play; the action is sporadic, the characterization rudimentary. The accomplishment of Charles Otte, who directed and also did the effective lighting, is to give dramatic form to the distinguished writer's dark reflections on human responses to catastrophe. The result can be seen at the Ensemble Theater.",1986-06-02T05:00:00+0000

Yet there's a fascinating inversion of point of view in the new work. If ''The Real Thing'' saw sexual dalliance from the perspective of the injured male ego, Schnitzler has forced Mr. Stoppard to cope with a victimized heroine - Christine, a prototypically Viennese ''sweet young girl'' who is casually seduced and abandoned by a narcissistic chocolate soldier.",1986-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Some illustrious names in show business - Liza Minnelli, Eartha Kitt, Ben Vereen and Susan Strasberg, to name a few - are among its 20,000 graduates. At tonight's concert, Eugene Fader will conduct the school's Senior Orchestra and Chorus in a program of Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky and Bizet. Joining them for a performance of ''I Got Rhythm'' is the jazz pianist Peter Nero, who is also an alumnus. The actress Helen Hayes will also present a tribute to the school. Original student artworks will be on view, both at Hunter College and at La Guardia High School, on Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street. The concert begins at 7:30 P.M. and will be followed by a buffet supper at the high school. Another alumnus, Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary, will entertain. Tickets are $10 for the art show and concert, and $15 for the buffet. Information: 546-1655.",1986-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Richard Lloyd, the former guitarist for Television, now writes heartfelt, Dylan-flavored rock songs and laces them with extraordinary guitar work. He will top a bill with two of the area's best unsigned bands, Persian Gulf and the Cucumbers, in a benefit concert for Amnesty International. The Cucumbers and Persian Gulf share a taste for smart, stripped-down, unconventional yet highly danceable rock songs. The Cucumbers put a 1980's twist on ''girl group'' rock; over taut guitar lines and crisp syncopations worthy of early Talking Heads, Deena Shoshkes sings in a bright, innocent voice about love, betrayal and entropy, often harmonizing with the Cucumbers' other guitarist-songwriter, Jon Fried. Persian Gulf is gruffer and more disillusioned. Hal Shows's songs are as rawboned as the best Creedence Clearwater; they link personal frustration and political rage without wasting a word or a note. The Gyros open Saturday at 10 P.M., followed by Persian Gulf, the Cucumbers and Richard Lloyd. Tickets are $12.",1986-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Paper, $7.95. A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ISLAND OF BUTTERFLIES By Nicholas Christopher. 81 pp. New York: Viking. Cloth, $17.95. Penguin. Paper, $8.95. THE current popularity of the dramatic monologue among younger poets is due in part to the influence of Florence Anthony, who uses the pen name Ai. All her poems are monologues, and she has given the form a striking contemporaneity: imagine a Browning monologue rewritten in the terse manner of Sam Shepard and you have a good idea of what an Ai poem sounds like. Like Browning, she is almost perversely fascinated by the problems of evil. Whether they are the oppressors or the oppressed, her characters yearn for power above all else, and they know they must be corrupted to attain it. Her cast of personae is large, ranging from Latin American priests and farm women to John and Robert Kennedy, Joseph McCarthy and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Ai invariably captures her speakers in physical and psychological crisis, and she permits them neither eloquence nor redemption. Her characters offer a kind of stammering, desperate testimony, last-ditch efforts at self-justification before acknowledging their damnation. As the title of her new collection implies, Ai is ultimately a religious poet, but the deity she envisions is wrathful and she seems to identify with such a figure: these are poems in which violence and destruction become eerily voluptuous.",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

HOW does one reconcile liberty, socialism and democracy? With an optimism all the more remarkable for its buoyancy in current political tides, two radical economists, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, present a case for ''postliberal democracy.'' In such a society, the visions of Locke, Marx and the radical democrats would all at last be realized. The authors argue that any other social order is inherently contradictory, hence unstable. Indeed, much of the book explores the contradictions among the rights classical liberals defend against the unlawful intrusions of others, the Marxists' call for economic justice and the democrats' vision of participation as the means to autonomy and self-realization. Mr. Bowles and Mr. Gintis, both professors of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, propose instead a ''visionary-historical conception'' of a world in which the claims of personal freedom, economic efficiency and popular sovereignty could all be simultaneously attained.",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

This fictionalized treatment of the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende in 1973 is a ''first-class political novel,'' Benjamin DeMott said here in 1979. Its principal achievement, he said, is ''the subtle interplay of political analysis and psychological self-scrutiny'' that appears in a diary kept by its heroine, a secretary to Allende's wife. THE OUTLAW YEARS: The History of the Land Pirates of the Natchez Trace, by Robert M. Coates. (University of Nebraska, $7.95.) In the early 19th century, the desperadoes who operated along the Natchez Trace - the overland route through Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi - aroused terror in the hearts of settlers and frontiersmen. This history chronicles the doings of such bandits as the psychopathic Samuel Mason, the dandified Joseph Hare and the dreaded Harpe brothers, of whom our reviewer, John Chamberlain, said in 1930, ''No Gilles de Rais could match them in refinements of cruelty, in diabolical, torturous death-dealing.''

QUICKSILVER NIGHTMARES","Roberta Allen, a visual artist whose work has been exhibited worldwide, accompanies her first collection of stories, THE TRAVELING WOMAN (Vehicle Editions, 238 Mott Street, New York, N.Y. 10012, Paper, $12), with her drawings in a handsome little book of her own design. Think of these 54 fiercely compressed stories as quicksilver dreams in which a single word or gesture is the exact metaphor for the separation between a man and a woman. Think of these stories as koans, or comments on the human condition to which the only response can be a deeper recognition of isolation. In ''Bottled,'' a woman comes upon a snake as she walks along the beach. ''A cobra here? We are not in a wild place.'' The man she is with traps the snake in a bottle, brings it to their hotel room, lies back to watch it. ''Bottled, alive, the snake slithers; writhing up and down and around its transparent cage. I was wrong, she thinks. This is a wild place.'' In ''Language,'' a woman ''hears the cries of animals. She looks down over a ledge into a small slaughterhouse by the sea below: a bull, a pig, a sheep, wail and hurl themselves against the walls of their pens.'' Three men slaughter the animals, then eat a hearty lunch -butchering is nothing to them. The story concludes, ''The woman who watches them is very young, and a foreigner: she doesn't speak their language but she understands.''",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

Kennedy lost the Presidential election in 1960 to Richard Nixon, and yet another in which Jack's older brother Joe lived to become President Kennedy, and so on. The notion of parallel universes or branching time-lines is not new in science fiction, but only in the last few years have theoretical physicists, in an effort to account for some of the bizarre findings of quantum mechanics, begun speculating about similar hypotheses.

IN 1977 a neo-Nazi group applied for a permit to march in Skokie, Ill., a suburb of Chicago whose large Jewish population includes survivors of German concentration camps. When the permit was denied, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit, arguing that the free speech clause of the First Amendment protected the group's right to march. The issue stirred up a broad national controversy; 30,000 A.C.L.U. members resigned in protest. Ultimately, the courts said the Nazis could march in Skokie. (They didn't, but held a brief demonstration in downtown Chicago instead.) Whether the Constitution should protect speech that defames religious and racial groups or advocates totalitarian government has long been controversial. Neither the language of the First Amendment nor the history surrounding its adoption answers these and other difficult questions concerning its scope and application. Rather, courts have muddled along as they do in most areas of law, their doctrines both relying on and giving rise to theories, or models, of the amendment.

They will only offer commercial mortgages with rates of about 14 percent that carry up to 5 points. Since the piece of property I am trying to buy is primarily a residence, why won't the banks give me a home mortgage? . . ., M. P., Bronx Answer: The fact that your are buying the house as an investment and not for your own use has as much to do with your difficulty in obtaining a standard home loan as does the fact that the building has a commercial space basement, said Stanley Greenstein of Mortgage Clearing House, a mortgage consultation, processing and placement company. Mr. Greenstein said that if you were going to live on the property, the banks would consider your personal income in establishing your credit worthiness. But as an investment, the property must sustain itself on its income alone. Since you are looking for a $150,000 loan, Mr. Greenstein said, it is possible that the banks did not feel that the rents would cover the monthly payments.

Henry turned out to be good at figures, and in 1865 he became a partner in Carnegie's Union Iron Mills. Three decades later, when J. P. Morgan was putting together United States Steel, he coveted Carnegie's company and arranged a meeting. Legend has it that Morgan asked, ''What's your price?'' Carnegie pushed a piece of paper across the table. Morgan glared at the figures and nodded. That nod yielded about $226 million for Carnegie, more than double the price he'd asked in a deal that had fallen through 18 months earlier. Henry Phipps received $43 million - roughly $500 million in today's money. Receiving the news, Phipps burbled, ''Ain't Andy wonderful?'' The Phipps fortune was made, and over the years it survived.

PEOPLE expect an awful lot from their newspapers, and the news isn't the half of it: they also expect the Last Word on practically everything. Thus the poor drudges who blunt their taste at bad plays night after night, and the drones who have to master two books a week - books of a kind that most people put aside a whole summer to read - are assumed to be the most important critics in town, while the hurry-up sages of the editorial pages may be the only voice some people will ever hear on the Middle East or the decline of the yen. (All the above, by the way, is supposed to be done entertainingly.) It's a lot to ask for 30 cents, but certain hardy souls devote their lives to bucking the odds and making newspapers just that good; and of these, none delivered the goods more consistently than Red Smith, the subject of Ira Berkow's skillful biography. Un-initiates might object right off that sportswriting is too slight and easy to count in the Sisyphus League, but it is easy only in whatever sense six-day bicycle racing is easy. The sports guy merely has to pump his way round and round the same old sports calendar ''making it new,'' in Ezra Pound's words, every time around.

In France and, indeed, throughout the Continent, it has been otherwise - Bernanos's novels and his social or political essays were widely appreciated during his lifetime (1888-1948), and they still command the strong interest of a literate public, especially that segment of it with religious and philosophical interests.

us,THE SUMMER FORECAST IS FOR EVEN LESS OF THE SAME,"Conventional wisdom has it that television viewers long ago accepted the limitations of the medium and have moderated their expectations accordingly. My own experience is that viewers, even of the more ''sophisticated,'' upscale variety, are almost childishly irrational in their demands to be entertained several hours a night, seven days a week. Recently, I was personally taken to task by several friends and acquaintances who were incensed one Sunday evening when they discovered that ''Murder, She Wrote'' had been pre-empted on CBS for a special. Making matters worse, public television's Masterpiece Theater was bogged down in a dreary mini-series about civil war in 17th-century England. ''There was absolutely nothing to watch,'' cried the scorned viewers, darkly implying that I should somehow correct the situation. In fact, it has long seemed to me that television's ability to turn out a nonstop, multi-channel flow of programming is little short of astounding. And regularly finding islands of quality in that morass borders on the miraculous.",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

Did an adversarial news media make it impossible for the American Government to win the war in Vietnam? Not really, says Daniel C. Hallin, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego. He writes that ''what began to change in 1967 . . . was the conviction that the forces of good would inevitably prevail.'' Skepticism in the news media ran apace with skepticism within Government and was limited to technical matters - whether this program was actually working or that hill was worth taking - rather than addressing fundamental questions of American interests and Vietnamese society. Mr. Hallin looks closely at The New York Times (and occasionally at other papers) from 1961 to mid-1965, the years of increasing involvement, then turns his attention to network television. He writes that in The New York Times ''the lead stories focused on the public statements of top officials and were written 'straight,' as though the reporters knew nothing of the information printed inside the paper,'' that is, long after columnists on the editorial page had begun doubting the war. Mr. Hallin suggests that, in the end, President Nixon's Vietnamization program enjoyed the kind of support that winning the war had once received under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and that ''the administration not only succeeded in putting Vietnamization on the news agenda, but was able to produce a favorable balance of coverage of the South Vietnamese army.''",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

[ Page 1, Column 6. ] Austrians will vote for a president today with opinion polls unanimously predicting that Kurt Waldheim, the former Secretary General of the United Nations, will be elected. His Socialist opponent, Kurt Steyrer, said he regretted that Austria's image had been damaged by allegations about Mr. Waldheim's implication in war crimes in Greece and Yugoslavia during World War II. [ 16:1-3. ] An influential Catholic Jesuit journal, in a commentary officials said reflected Vatican thought, called the acquittal of six people charged with conspiring to kill Pope John Paul II a ''disconcerting sentence.'' The journal, La Civilta Cattolica, added that it appeared the attack was the result of ''an international plot.'' [ 9:1-3. ] An exiled Iranian left France under Government pressure in a move apparently intended to improve France's relations with Iran and speed the release of French hostages held in Lebanon. France said the Iranian opposition leader, Massoud Rajavi, had left voluntarily and had not been expelled. [ 22:1-3. ] National Critics say NASA's shuttle report omits a number of important criticisms among the conclusions it draws.

AMERICAN COMMANDER IN SPAIN Robert Hale Merriman and the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. By Marion Merriman and Warren Lerude. Illustrated. 255 pp. Reno: University of Nevada Press. $16.95. THIS year marks the 50th anniversary of the start of the Spanish Civil War. Franco has been dead for a decade, Spain is a democracy once again, and as the passions of that time gradually ease, these two books are fitting commemoratives for the internationalists who went to the defense of the republic. One is ''Collected Writings'' by John Cornford, the English poet who was killed in 1936, leaving behind a truncated oeuvre, some political exhortations and a handful of letters from the Aragon front. The second, ''American Commander in Spain,'' is a personal recollection by his wife of Robert Hale Merriman, a young teacher at the University of California, Berkeley, who became chief of staff of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion and died in the retreat from Belchite in 1938. (As Mrs. Merriman notes, the organization was a battalion and only much later became popularly known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.) The charismatic Merriman may have been Hemingway's inspiration for Robert Jordan in ''For Whom the Bell Tolls.'' The two men met briefly in Madrid, and Hemingway was deeply impressed.",1986-06-08T05:00:00+0000

Then a reforming king, who founded the first Burmese Empire, decided that too many nats spoiled the brotherhood and decreed that there would be only 36, commanded by a king nat. Rather like the saints of the Roman Catholic Church, each nat had his or her duty of intercession between God and mankind. Most of them had been human beings who had died famously or tragically like the beatified Christian martyrs; stories about their lives and deaths are a bardic history of Burma.

''You've got to take grief, you've got to take . . . . '' The things women had to take were unspeakable. And as she poked a dust mop under our beds and sometimes brought out, along with loathsome dust, a Coke bottle with a cockroach in it, she'd shout again, occasionally breaking dishes (cheap ones they gave away in movie theaters on Thursday nights during the Great Depression) as punctuation: ''I am not the maid!''

Backup includes Mike Renzi (piano), Grady Tate (drums), Jay Leonhart (bass), John Chiodini (guitar) and Mark Sherman (vibes). Shows are Tuesday through Saturday at 9 and 11 P.M.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. By Michael Talbot. (Knopf, $18.95.) Basing his novel on the settlement of Australia by British convicts in the late 18th century, Michael Talbot assembles a diverse crew of voyagers, mostly credible if not especially engaging. For Commodore Arthur Phillip, who leads a convoy of semiseaworthy vessels into partly uncharted seas, the venture is a desperate race against the French for territorial expansion. For the prisoners below decks, it is an unexpected alternative to the gallows. The narrative shifts from group to group, bringing into focus varying backgrounds and perspectives through some singular character types: Phillip, a bootstrap tough, a born risk taker; Kitty Brandon, whose credentials include some onstage triumphs and an offstage murder; Joe Cribb, a former soldier turned loose to live by his wits amid the London low life; Levi, a onetime peddler and medical quack in whom Messianic fervor is at war with practical experience. Although he knows that nothing can be had for nothing, he dreams of Australia's Botany Bay as an earthly paradise for the lost tribes of Israel. The Anglican cleric Richard Johnson disdains a land of milk and honey; what he wants is a harvest of Christian souls. By the end of the book part of the fleet has reached Botany Bay, but since this is the first in Mr. Talbot's projected series of novels about the founding of Australia, journey's end is only a beginning. The author (under a pseudonym) of spy novels and thrillers, he knows how to keep readers engrossed in the drama and brutality of naval exploration.",1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A SEASON OF PEACE. By G. E. Armitage. (St. Martin's, $12.95.) A runner-up for Britain's Trask Award for the best first novel of 1985, ''A Season of Peace'' is an extended meditation on grief and sorrow. As the narrator deals with the army bureaucracy in order to claim the body of his soldier son, killed by a terrorist bomb in Ireland, he recalls two periods of his own life as an army engineer: when he directed the construction of an antiaircraft battery on the coast of the North Sea; and when, at the end of World War II, he directed the installation's demolition. The narrator, never more than a concerned observer, tells us the story of the people at Cable Point, especially the tragedy of a 15-year-old named Mary. The novel discovers that war disrupts lives, perverts values, and has consequences far from the field of battle long after the battle is done. G. E. Armitage writes cleanly and even elegantly, but trying to make fresh a theme as old as the ''Iliad,'' he strains for stylistic effects that become irritants. In lieu of a plot, we are presented with recurring images. Dead gulls, sailors, sharks or cats are forever being washed ashore at Cable Point, are always discovered by children, and are always made playthings. The characters speak elliptically. Little is said, a great deal understood, and a page or two later all is explained. The impatient reader will gloss over the dialogue and turn directly to the explanations.",1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000

His hosts, the Marquess and Marchioness of Exeter, said they hadn't a clue about its origins, but suggested that the white, bottle-shaped porcelain vessel might be listed in a 1688 inventory of Burghley. The palace, the Marquess's ancestral home in Lincolnshire, had been built a century earlier by William Cecil when he was Lord High Treasurer to Elizabeth I. Mr. Lang's question, posed in 1981, sparked a search through Burghley's 17th-century inventories and its 240 rooms, an investigation that uncovered descriptions of that vase - it is 15th century - and a thousand other works. Most of the finest ceramics identified were selected for ''The Burghley Porcelains,'' a traveling exhibition on view at Japan House Gallery through July 27.",1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000

IT has often been said of Australian fiction that its style is essentially baroque - certainly its extravagant conceits, its mannered exuberance and its perverse comedy have struck an entirely new note in English writing since World War II. And there is a sense in which Elizabeth Jolley's latest novel, ''Milk and Honey,'' reflects this interesting development - even though she is an Australian by choice rather than by extraction. She was born in England, brought up in a German-speaking household, and did not immigrate to the other hemisphere until 1959 (at the age of 36); that is perhaps why the cultural landscape of this novel is essentially a European one, despite its Australian setting.",1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000

The narrator figure who often in earlier novels chaperones the reader round the action disappears. In ''Ulysses'' his place is taken by a series of narrators, usually undependable, who emerge and disappear without being identified. A whole galaxy of new devices and stances and verbal antics, extravagant, derisive, savage, rollicking, tender and lyrical, is held in Joyce's ironic dominion.

Can it prevent suicides? There is no evidence about that, although WNYW/Channel 5 makes a modest attempt at intervention tonight at 9 o'clock. The hourlong program is ''Suicide? Not My Kid!'' and it is made up of two distinct segments. In the first, tastefully done, parents whose children have committed suicide speak about what happened; in the second, viewers can call in and ask questions.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"RUNNING IN PLACE: Inside the Senate. By James A. Miller. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.) For those who have wondered what transpires behind the closed doors of the leaders of the United States Senate and why courage and innovation are in short supply there, James A. Miller has provided an insider's account, based on a week (April 25-29, 1983) in the lives of three senators and three staff members. This is an unvarnished look at the Senate in microcosm - its humor, foibles, conceits, crises and occasional victories. It is a week in which Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee and the Majority Leader, seeks unsuccessfully to use his low-key powers of persuasion to unify Senate Republicans on a budget proposal. The Senator is aided by James D. Range, his counsel, ''a legislative cowboy - a southern, tough-talking, Jack Daniels-drinking, boyishly handsome, charismatic lawyer who long ago made the right connections on his way up north.'' It is a week in which Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has alienated many colleagues by demanding a closed Senate session on Central America, and in which Senator Alan K. Simpson, a witty Wyoming Republican, is pushing for a new immigration bill. Rounding out the cast of characters are Stephen Bell, an aide to the Senate Budget Committee whose powers rival those of his boss, according to Mr. Miller, and Mary Jane Checchi, an aide to the newly-elected Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, who is tutoring her boss on the mores of the Senate.",1986-06-15T05:00:00+0000

Even so, I had trouble with the news that Dominique Bozo had submitted his resignation as director of the Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris. If ever anyone was at the top of his particular tree, it was Mr. Bozo, who last fall was the man primarily responsible for two triumphant episodes in the cultural history of Paris. Between them, the opening of the new Picasso Museum and the reinstallation of the Musee National d'Art Moderne made Paris, once again and after 40 years, the place where it was necessary to be. How could he possibly resign, and for what reason? Admittedly, no man could direct both the Picasso Museum and the Musee National d'Art Moderne indefinitely, and it was known that Mr. Bozo wished to hand over the running of the Picasso Museum, once it was launched. In due time, the curator and art historian Pierre Georgel was appointed as his successor. At the Musee National d'Art Moderne there was, on the other hand, a great deal still to be done, and it was universally hoped among the museum profession that Mr. Bozo would stay until the task had been completed. (Both physically and administratively, the Musee National d'Art Moderne is part of the Pompidou Center.)

The Support Committee's 40 offices around the country search for those blacks who have been detained under the state of emergency declaration.

Meanwhile, the Government also reported a ''significant decrease'' in violence.

The barricades were erected to fend off the ''Hippies,'' a band of about 1,000 caravan wanderers who have alarmed British authorities. [ 1:1. ] Soviet negotiators have signaled a willingness to work on verification problems for long-range mobile missiles and have for the first time suggested some possible verification measures, Administration officials say. Officials said the move should be seen as another sign that the Geneva arms talks still have the potential for serious give-and-take.

WITH nine works of fiction that preceded ''Beachmasters,'' Thea Astley achieved an awesome repute in Australia, winning the coveted Miles Franklin Award three times for novels described by critics as ''scathing visions.'' If the novels recently published here by Penguin and Viking are exemplary, the description is accurate. Miss Astley's visions of society in backwater Queensland or in the South Seas are scathing indeed. Yet they are compassionate in an oblique way, and they feature striking pages of rather heavy lyricism. The extent to which American readers will respond to her talent will depend very much on their appreciation of her idiosyncratic language and, in this novel, on the ready sympathy they bring to the subject of the rulers and the ruled in a Pacific Ocean colony.",1986-06-22T05:00:00+0000

W., Manhattan Answer: Yes, it has. According to David Fishlow, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office, the agency has been seeing an increasing number of plans in which the residential and commercial components are separate. One reason these plans, which are often referred to as ''condops,'' are becoming more popular is because retaining control of the commercial or professional space in a building is sometimes more profitable for the sponsor than selling the entire project as a single entity.",1986-06-22T05:00:00+0000

As the left-handed Don Mattingly approaches the batter's box, the Red Sox turn to a left-handed relief pitcher, Joe Sambito, in an effort to retire Mattingly and end the game. With first base unoccupied, Sambito can afford a walk to Mattingly, so he is instructed to keep the ball off the strike zone as much as possible in the hope that Mattingly will swing at a bad pitch. On the first pitch, though, Sambito throws the ball so far off the plate that it gets by the catcher. Randolph easily scores the tying run, but Henderson rounds third base too sharply, then slips and is thrown out before he can scramble back, ending the inning. If Jim Rice leads off the bottom of the ninth for Boston with a game-winning homer, who gets credit for the victory, Clemens, who shut out the Yankees until the last batter, or Sambito, whose only pitch was a wild one that tied the score?",1986-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.A few years ago I used Scotch tape to mount several prints on the door of my white refrigerator. After the prints became worn-looking I decided to peel them off, but I found I could not remove all the tape. Can you suggest how to remove these unsightly remains? A. First scrape off as much of the tape as possible with a plastic scraper similar to the kind used to remove ice from an auto windshield. These plastic scrapers won't scratch the finish the way a metal one would. If you have trouble scraping the tape off, try heating it with a hair dryer or heat lamp. To avoid scorching the tape, use mild heat only. If the tape gets too gummy to scrape, you may get better results by rubbing hard with a rag. Any sticky residue can be washed off with rubber cement thinner or lighter fluid. Q. I recently bought an apartment that has metal closet doors. These have been painted over a number of times and need repainting. How can I remove all of the old paint before I put the new paint on? A. One method is to use a chemical paint remover and another is to use a heat gun or electric ''stripper.'' The heat gun is a little slower than the remover, but will create less of a mess if handled carefully. Of course, you will have to buy or rent a heat gun and it may not pay if you have only one or two doors to do. Q.

The court, the judicial arm of the United Nations, ordered Washington to halt the''arming and training'' of the insurgents and to pay Nicaragua for damages caused by military attacks. [ Page 1, Column 2. ] The State Department rejected the World Court's finding that United States policy toward Nicaragua violated international law and denounced the court as an inappropriate body to judge complex international military issues. A department spokesman said the court's full opinion had not been received and therefore the American reaction would be only a preliminary one. [ 4:1. ] The Irish turned down, by more than a 3-to-2 margin, a measure to end the ban on divorce. The defeat in a referendum on a constitutional amendment proposed by Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald was seen as a severe blow to the coalition led by Mr. FitzGerald, who led the fight to end the Irish Republic's standing as the only Western European nation without legal divorce. [ 1:4. ] Italy's Prime Minister stepped down, bringing an end to the country's longest-lasting postwar Goverment. Former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, a Socialist, had held office since August 1983. He was forced to resign after his Government lost a secret-ballot vote on a local finance bill. [ 3:4. ] Suspension of the Anzus treaty between the United States and New Zealand was announced by the State Department after Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Prime Minister David Lange failed to mend their rift over nuclear policy.

Regency England was like a compulsive bon vivant whose nightly overindulgence is matched each morning by the equally excessive appeasement of his Puritan soul. The historian Carolly Erickson, author of ''Bloody Mary,'' has spun out a lively and thoroughly enthralling account of this paradoxical age - 1810 to 1820 - whose gods were Byron and the Duke of Wellington (Napoleon's conqueror) but whose all-too-human ruler was a puckish, overweight boy-man given to wide mood swings and overdoses of laudanum and fast women. When his father, George III, began to recede into his own mad dream world, Parliament appointed the Prince of Wales, later George IV, as Regent. George both repelled and fascinated his subjects: they regularly castigated him for his profligacy and his very public battle to divorce his promiscuous wife, Caroline. But thousands of them also stood in line for hours just to glimpse his private chambers at Carlton House - and the remains of his legendary all-night ball. According to Miss Erickson, the excesses of the melancholy young Byron, both romantic and literary, took on symbolic power, dramatizing what she calls the ''diseased and violent'' undertow of the age, the sense that there was a ''canker at the root of things.'' Hannah More, a stern Christian evangelical, agreed and in her best-selling tracts exhorted Britain to cleanse itself of worldliness, encouraging the rise of a ferociously pious army of reformers.",1986-06-29T05:00:00+0000

This is, after all, the family-owned company whose 150 employees can still buy groceries at a company commissary. It is the company whose executives still cite a nearly disastrous push into specialty-food products in the early 1900's as a reason why they have generally shunned attempts to develop new products or capitalize on the well-known Tabasco name.
