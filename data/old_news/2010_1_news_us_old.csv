Gioia, kept an office for the past eight years. Mr. Van Bramer, 40, a former Queens Borough Public Library official, decided to keep the place, Suite No. 203. Mr. Gioia left Mr. Van Bramer a welcome note in the drawer of the big desk, along with this advice: Lock the windows and doors. The office had been broken into twice (burglars, not political operatives). The first time, the computers were stolen, which was problematic, Mr. Gioia said, because as chairman of the Councils Oversight and Investigations Committee, he had some sensitive information on those hard drives. As a worker changed the locks, Mr. Van Bramer surveyed the clutter of desks, phone wires and supplies. Ah, the glamour of public office. He said he would modernize the dingy dcor with a hasty repainting and recarpeting job, and update Mr. Gioias poster of Mookie Wilson, a Mets center fielder in the 1980s, with one of himself standing with Jos Reyes, the teams current shortstop.",2010-01-01T00:23:36+0000

The Samsung patents relate to the way LCD screens portray the black and white portion of images. Samsung is seeking to block imports of Sharp Aquos HDTVs made in Mexico. Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, won an earlier trade commission order banning Sharp televisions from the United States. That case is on appeal.

Overseas shipments gained 33.7 percent in December from a year earlier, to $36.2 billion, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said Friday. That was more than the median 27.9 percent forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists. Imports rose 24 percent, to $32.9 billion, for a trade surplus of $3.3 billion. For 2009, the countrys trade surplus reached a record $41 billion as imports dropped 25.8 percent while exports declined 13.8 percent, the ministry said in a statement. Exports to China, the biggest buyer of South Korean goods, surged 74.4 percent in the first 20 days of December, the ministrys report showed. Shipments to the United States rose 8.7 percent and shipments to Europe gained 49.4 percent over the same period.

us,Singapore Says Its Economy Is Set to Grow This Year,"Singapores economy is improving after a volatile year in which it shrank for the first time since 2001, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, left, says. Gross domestic product fell 2.1 percent in 2009, Mr. Lee said in his New Year message on Thursday. The figure was in line with the government estimate for a contraction of 2 to 2.5 percent. The trade ministry forecasts that the economy will expand 3 to 5 percent in 2010, an estimate reiterated by Mr. Lee. Singapore joined other Asian nations in emerging from a global economic slump last year after the regions governments unveiled about $1 trillion in stimulus measures to spur growth. Still, a sluggish recovery in overseas demand for goods could moderate growth prospects in the coming months, the government said in November. The economy grew 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Mr. Lee said. That compares with the 3.8 percent median forecast of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

During a six-week trial last year in Washington, held without a jury, Feld Entertainment, which owns Ringling Brothers, said that these things didnt hurt the elephants, and that they were necessary measures to control them and ensure public safety. This ruling represents a victory for the elephants and a win for the United States Constitution, said Michelle Pardo, a lawyer representing Feld, because it reinforces that the federal court is no place to entertain a philosophical debate about whether elephants should be in the circus.",2010-01-03T22:46:27+0000

If he does not, heaven will collapse and Satan will reign supreme. Marion McClinton is directing the production; he is best known for his direction of plays by August Wilson, including the Broadway production of King Hedley II, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award.

But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: Avatar was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the Twilight sequel New Moon, which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released Avatar, seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales.

Ms. Stritch, who is almost 85, is presenting At Home at the Carlyle: Elaine Stritch Singin Sondheim ...

Her approach to Sondheim is a dramatic no-holds-barred wrestling match between the singer and the song, in which there is little doubt about the outcome, writes Stephen Holden.

There are only three items on the menu: a taco, burrito and quesadilla, with a variety of possible preparations. Hint: say yes to the guacamole. Go for the simple and succulent food, stripped-down cooking served in Spartan conditions. Just like at Gordo, Dos Toros has a short menu, high standards and such satisfying fare you dont mind the hospital lighting. Also look out for other Left Coast details: the biodegradable corn-based utensils, the aggressive composting policy, the disarmingly nice staff.

The Bob Barker, a 1,200-ton vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the activist group featured on the Animal Planet series Whale Wars, was among the ships that tried to stop a Japanese whaling mission in waters near Antarctica. Mr. Barker, 86, donated the money for his namesake ship after meeting the Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson through a fellow animal advocate. He said he thought he could put the Japanese whaling fleet out of business if he had $5 million, Mr. Barker told The A.P. I said, I think you do have the skills to do that, and I have $5 million, so lets get it on.' Sea Shepherd describes itself as an anti-poaching organization, and says it enforces the United Nations World Charter for Nature by intervening in whaling missions.",2010-01-06T15:41:00+0000

But then I chose to spend a bit more time in Honduras and Nicaragua, and everybody seemed to be out of Costa Rica for holiday travel. Since my return flight was from Costa Rica, I went anyway but figured I probably wouldnt be able to write. (And, frankly, my daughter had come along for the trip in part because of the promise of going to Costa Rica; I didnt want to be the one to tell her that she would get the Honduran slums and impoverished Nicaraguan villages, but no Costa Rican beach or jungle.)Then a Times researcher, Hilary Howard, sent me the Happy Planet Index report, which I read while driving around the country. The report got me thinking about Costa Rica and happiness. So I poked around, perused the data, and the column took shape. Originally, I thought I would frame the column more in terms of Latin and Caribbean countries doing unusually well in happiness surveys; I was fascinated by the idea that this reflected a cultural emphasis on building social capital as opposed to financial capital.

That is the day before the orchestra is to leave for a residency in Miami. That tour is in question, Jeffrey Rathbun, the orchestras assistant principal oboist and the musicians chief negotiator, said in a statement. The players contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Mst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind, Gary Hanson, the orchestras executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, which is why we keep slipping in the rankings in relation to salaries at other orchestras. We just cant keep slipping any further, he added.

Its a great story: The boy king, in exile after his fathers execution in a populist uprising, grows up to return as monarch, only to face epochal disasters like the plague and the Great Fire of London. Throw in the handsome kings wandering eye (poor barren Queen Catherine had to put up with Charless bankrolling of one mistress after another, as well as the welcoming to court of his illegitimate children); an ABC of conniving ministers (Arlington, Buckingham, Clarendon); and a cluster of brilliant minds (Hobbes and Locke, Milton and Marvell, Newton, Dryden and the inveterate diarist Pepys), and its clear why chronicling this vital era became irresistible. But Uglow does more than narrate the dramatic events of the Restoration, a period known, not coincidentally, for its theater, which often parodied royal affairs. ",2010-01-08T16:54:42+0000

Movies like Star Trek, which made both box-office-watchers and critics happy, would seem tailor-made for the 10. And Star Trek did get one of the 10 slots on the Producers Guild of America ballots, alongside another sci-fi favorite, District 9. But, with a few exceptions, like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the Academy has historically shown little love to films that explore the futuristic great beyond, the could-have-been past or the alternate-reality present.

The two thick blue volumes sort roughly 920,000 words into 797,120 meanings and organize those meanings into 236,400 numbered categories and subcategories. Like Peter Mark Rogets famous thesaurus, first issued in 1852, the H.T.O.E.D. not only lists synonyms but also provides what its editors call a modified folk taxonomy of Englishs meanings  carefully placing deity, for example, among the supernatural elements of the external world, while slotting worship among the manifestations of faith in the social world. It draws on the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, as well as a few Old English sources. The task of dicing up the O.E.D. and reassembling it into the H.T.O.E.D. took 44 years, and most of the intellectual labor was performed by humans, working with pencils and slips of paper.

us,Prisoners of Parole," IN 2004, STEVEN ALM, a state trial judge in Hawaii, was frustrated with the cases on his docket. Nearly half of the people appearing before him were convicted offenders with drug problems who had been sentenced to probation rather than prison and then repeatedly violated the terms of that probation by missing appointments or testing positive for drugs. Whether out of neglect or leniency, probation officers would tend to overlook a probationers first 5 or 10 violations, giving the offender the impression that he could ignore the rules. But eventually, the officers would get fed up and recommend that Alm revoke probation and send the offender to jail to serve out his sentence. That struck Alm as too harsh, but the alternative  winking at probation violations  struck him as too soft. I thought, This is crazy, this is a crazy way to change peoples behavior, he told me recently. ",2010-01-08T19:13:23+0000

With only a small stipend for personal expenses, I was unable to even think about going to an antiwar rally in Washington, scheduled for January 1991. Thats where Peg Mullen came in. News traveled around the community that the woman about whom Friendly Fire was written was chartering a bus for anyone who wanted to attend the rally. She filled that bus, at no cost to me and others who wanted to raise their voices in opposition. Before I read Sara Corbetts essay, I had all but forgotten that moment and would not have been able to recall Mullens name. The endless bus trip, the solidarity, the cold and the crowd all come back to me now. It was a small act in a lifetime of actions.

us,Letters: Freelancers and Climate Change,"Re Times Standards, Staffers or Not (Jan. 3): The clear intent of the freelancers contract seems to be, You will not accept anything of value not provided by The New York Times. What payers are covered as current or potential news sources? Is there any person or organization that is not at least a potential news source? Even a Stylite Monk sitting on top of a column for 30 years might serve as a source in a story about his motivations or experiences. The policy appears to me to be facially nonsense. A better idea? Have all writers disclose to The Times all investments over $500 and all receipts of value greater than $250, have the list available to me online and let me judge the extent, if any, that their coverage might be influenced. MARK TRENTACOSTECherry Hill, N.J., Jan. 3, 2010 It is surprising that The Times would rely solely upon 3Ms reimbursement of travel expenses for Mary Tripsas to condemn her for violating policy, when 3M might have contributed instead to her Harvard Business School research budget (or had its proxy do so) and thus avoided the perception of a conflict. My experience has shown me that it is impossible to avoid all potential conflicts and that some conflicts may actually be productive. I agree that The Times should take a firm stand on the most egregious conflicts, but rather than focus obsessively on avoiding all conflicts, it should also consider the quality of the work produced.I think that it would have been more valuable if you had provided some commentary on the column that Ms. Tripsas wrote on 3M to assess whether and how her writing might have been influenced by the arrangement. That places a higher burden on the public advocate, but one that is appropriate, in my view.STEVE PERCOCOEast Falmouth, Mass., Jan. 3, 2010 The policy described in your column, that your that contributors must be free of even the smallest hint of undue influence, goes beyond what I feel is necessary to ensure that the readers have reason to trust our credibility. Frankly, I am offended that The the Timess editors would feel I am such a puritan and/or ignoramus as to assume that any junket given to a freelance reporter in an entirely separate matter would taint the reporters credibility and objectivity, or that of The Times. I certainly dont discount the risk of such things happening. Rather, I think that The Times is taking the easy way out. I would respect The Times more if it would allow a limited amount of flexibility in such cases, and itself undertook to determine whether a freelancers other activities threatened the credibility of what appeared in The Times. I recognize that part of the problem in the cases you cite is the fact that the freelancers didnt report their own conflicts, and that is a separate issue from the conflicts themselves. Nevertheless, I remain uneasy that you are unable to live with the mere existence of conflicts. It reminds me of the concept of ritual uncleanliness that notionally pollutes all who come in contact with it, which is unworthy of an intelligent and sophisticated society.I have no intention of canceling my subscription, nor of ceasing my regular visits to The Timess Web site, just because you have gone so far in depriving yourselves, and your readers, of useful contributors as to arguably lower the potential range of your coverage. But a regular and loyal customer nevertheless considers that you have done just that, and would be happy if you eased off just a little. DON THOMASCalgary, Alberta, Jan. 3, 2010 Rather than outright disqualification, wouldnt simple disclosure of the potential conflict  in or alongside the published column  do the job in many cases? That way the reader could decide what weight to give the potential conflict in evaluating the reliability of the information in the column and the worth of the columnists opinion. JIM LUTHERMendocino, Calif., Jan. 4, 2010 When someone is on the staff of The Times, The Times undoubtedly pays for their travel to important conferences in the field they cover. But if they freelance they must pay for these trips with their own money?Sounds to me like its unethical for The Times to hire freelancers, because its a cheapskate way of transferring legitimate business expenses from The Times to the worker. The Times should cover these expenses themselves if the paper feels it is a conflict of interest for someone else to cover them (which I agree, it is). Forcing freelancers to pay those expenses when employees get them covered is not fair.ISABEL WALCOTT DRAVESManhattan, Jan 4, 2010Scientists and JournalistsRe Stolen E-Mail, Stoking the Climate Debate (Dec. 5): With some real intensive investigative research, maybe this is a three-alarm story. One way or another, The Times needs to get this one right. If this is a fraud, The Times surely does not want to be the last to acknowledge it. We cannot afford to be wrong on climate warming. If the Associated Press can put 11 staff members on Sarah Palins new book, The Times must have the staff to follow through on climate warming  including giving the many highly respectable skeptics a sufficient platform for raising their issues, and sinking or swimming. MIKE BOURISMendocino, Calif., Dec. 6, 2009 Why is it that the media at large, and your column in particular, refers to supporters of the human-caused global warming theory as scientists, but uses the term skeptics (not scientists) for any scientist who rebuts that theory? Are not the physicist Fred Singer and the climatologist Timothy Ball scientists (as well as skeptics)?Should you not describe the two camps as supporters and skeptics, or simply scientists? By referring to one group as scientists and the other as skeptics, you are boosting the credentials of one at the expense of the other. RONALD BREMNER Glen Ridge, N.J., Dec. 6, 2009 You missed a major opportunity to explore the difference in reporting on politics and science  and the challenges faced by reporters when science becomes politicized. Im sure you know that there is broad scientific consensus on the science behind climate change. The latest I.P.C.C. synthesis report is quite clear about the cause and threat. At what point is it O.K. for a credible news organization to stop publicizing discredited theories and individuals? Does there need to be any verifiable proof at all? Or is it O.K. to give a few contrarians equal billing? At what point (if at all) did The Times stop quoting tobacco-industry-funded spokespeople? If we could find a few scientists to insist the sun revolves around the earth would we create a man-bites-dog controversy  and give them equal billing? SAM BOYKINQueens, Dec. 7, 2009  A deliberate conspiracy to cover up information is hardly ever the problem with The New York Times or any other media outlet. The problem is bias, which is not deliberate, but often unconscious. I have little doubt that The Times will be as conscientious and professional as possible, but because your information is necessarily limited and uncertain, you will tend to favor the data and the interpretations that support your belief in anthropogenic global warming. Thats normal and natural. Bias is a powerful force operating on any journalist. This much has become clear as a result of Climategate: The myth, perpetrated by global warming alarmists, that we have serene, Olympian scientists on the one hand and ideologically driven skeptics on the other is now gone with the global wind. If we are honest and admit the inevitable presence of bias even in the aeries of science, then we must acknowledge that the skeptics have a vital role to play in the debate, especially since it is now clear that we cannot count on the global-warming advocates to check themselves. If nothing else, the skeptics can improve the science of global warming by finding problems for advocates in the science to solve. TUCKER LANDYFrankfort, Ky., Dec. 6, 2009",2010-01-09T16:12:17+0000

But now that a 2006 state law restricting water use for landscaping is finally taking effect, local jurisdictions all over the state must figure out what to do about the issue by Jan. 31. Some are adopting the states model ordinance on landscaping and water conservation; others, like Palo Alto and Menlo Park, are trying to come up with their own. Some of these severely limit the extend of lawns in new or remodeled corporate or residential landscapes. Wary of these possibilities and other more draconian drought-driven restrictions, homeowners in high-end lawn-bedecked suburbs like Atherton and Hillsborough are putting in their own wells as insurance against municipal water cutbacks.Taking It Slow and Easy in Sonoma | An Italian group recently honored Sonoma as a slow city, providing the livability of a time gone by, with few if any chain stores, enough farmers markets and a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly ambiance.

Neither Mr. Deitch, right, nor officials at the museum returned calls asking for comment, but several experts with knowledge of the search said that Eli Broad, the arts patron who pledged $30 million to save the museum when it was on the brink of financial collapse in 2008, reached out to many unconventional art-world personalities, including Tobias Meyer, head of Sothebys contemporary art department worldwide and Sothebys principal auctioneer, as well as Samuel Keller, the art fair impresario who ran Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach until he became director of the Beyeler Foundation in Riehen, Switzerland, in 2006. While the Harvard-educated Mr. Deitch has vast experience working with artists, selling artworks and presenting shows, he has never had a job that involved fund-raising, which is a crucial part of a museum directors portfolio. He has, however, worn many hats. In 1979 he helped start an art advisory service for wealthy clients at Citibank. He has also been a private art dealer, and in 1996 founded Deitch Projects, which now has two spaces in New York; in 1997 Sothebys bought 50 percent of Deitch Projects, a relationship that has since dissolved. Besides running his galleries Mr. Deitch worked at Sothebys managing its 20th-century Art Gallery Program for a few years.

But following disagreements about the creative direction of the film (Hollywood translation: the script wasnt so good and there were conflicting casting strategies), Mr. Raimi opted to move on, according to Deadline.com. Rather than move forward with a different director, Sony decided to push the button on a Spider-Man reboot that it has been simultaneously developing. In a press release Monday afternoon, Sony confirmed that the next Spider-Man movie will take Peter Parker back to high school. The new chapter, written by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac), will have a new cast and director and focus on a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises, Sony said. The target release date is now summer 2012.

The full-page ads were scheduled to run in both The Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety. For every $100 million it earns at the box office, Avatar will deliver an estimated 40 million tobacco impressions to theater audiences, said the ads, referring to scenes involving a cigarette-smoking character played by Sigourney Weaver. That estimate of the films value to tobacco companies included anticipated home video sales. To date, Avatar has taken in more than $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office. In a statement last week, James Cameron, its director, took sharp issue with the notion that the movie advocates smoking simply because it portrays cigarette use. The new advertisements were paid for by Smoke Free Movies, a campaign supervised by Stanton A. Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, with backing from the American Legacy Foundation. The foundation was established with money from a 1998 settlement of legal claims between tobacco companies and 46 states.",2010-01-12T00:03:13+0000

Its obviously embarrassing to have to carry permission slips from the Taliban, but, hey, thats just the only way to work in those areas.I think thats a useful way to think about education in rural parts of Afghanistan as well. Some aid groups are already negotiating with the Taliban about putting schools in certain areas that the Taliban control. The biggest concern for the Taliban has been that boys and girls be separate and that the girls are taught by a woman. Their other big issue is that the school books cant have a photo of President Karzai. With those conditions they have, sometimes, been willing to allow girls and boys education. Thats not going to work everywhere, and the Taliban will be more suspicious of schools than of vaccinations  but I think its worth trying in more areas.

World War II dramas, the story of a Rothschild baroness in postwar New York, and a crime story co-directed by a Palestinian and an Israeli are all on the bill. Two of the stronger films, according to Stephen Holden, depart from the beaten path of historical documentaries and feature films, many of which focus on the Holocaust. One of them is Haim Tabakmans fateful drama Eyes Wide Open, set in contemporary Jerusalem. The film observes the unforgiving response within an ultra-Orthodox enclave to a gay relationship involving one of its own. The other is Adam Elliots claymation feature, Mary and Max, which follows the pen-pal relationship of Mary Dinkle (the voice of Toni Collette), a lonely 8-year-old girl living outside Melbourne, Australia, and Max Horovitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an obese 44-year-old Jewish New Yorker with Aspergers syndrome.

And now the earthquake.Poverty always hugely magnifies natural disasters. I saw this first in the terrible 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh that killed more than 100,000 people. The poorest people lived in marginal areas, such as flood plains, and in flimsy huts that were immediately washed away. So they were killed. Those who were better off lived on firmer land in sturdier homes, and after the disaster they were able to afford clean water and medical care for their children. Frequently what kills people in these disasters isnt just nature but its interconnection with poverty, and in Haiti its imperative to arrange not only the earthquake response  digging people out of rubble  but also a public health response by controlling disease and assuring access to clean water for survivors.",2010-01-13T13:54:24+0000

Lost Highway Records, which is releasing the album on Feb. 26 (which would have been Cashs 78th birthday), called it the final installment in Cashs American Recordings series, whose first self-titled release was in 1994.

The app also detects where you are in relation to every place in the guide and offers a link to Google maps for directions. Only the listings of restaurants, bars and nightclubs are lacking. Theyre all consolidated into one section called Urban Life, which does have appealing suggestions but also gives short shrift to cities with thousands of places to eat, drink and be merry.

After some serious thrift-store digging, Cohen and Yamamoto found some likely candidates for their repurposing effort. In their experiments, they found that when the garments were disassembled and laid flat, their backs resembled traditional animal-skin rugs. Each rug is backed with felt and stamped with the BCXSY logo and a serial number for authenticity. At their introduction during Dutch design week in October, some of the rugs were snapped up by Rossana Orlandi for her renowned design store in Milan.

In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of Avatar were unequivocally reminiscent of the Noon Universe novels, and told The Guardian that the film is harmful for western civilization. But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen Avatar, and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism.

Tight ends then were used mostly like another tackle. Their primary job was to wall off the edge of the defense for the most important offensive weapon of the time: the runners. But the Bears coach, George Halas, had other ideas. He sometimes put space between Ditka and the offensive line, making Ditka one of the first tight ends to split out a bit and become a receiving threat. As a rookie in 1961, Ditka was the teams leading receiver, catching 56 passes for 1,076 yards. In 1964, he caught 75 passes. ",2010-01-14T19:48:59+0000

Its markers, commemorating acts of violence that seem to repeat themselves through the generations in a cruel infinity loop, consist of dark highways stretching to the horizon. Under them lies a dense matrix of remains. The bones of Plains Indians, Confederate soldiers, hard-luck homesteaders and hellbound drunks mix in a democratic necropolis capped by thousands of miles of oily blacktop. These routes, which for some writers promise liberation  an escape into unbounded freedom and possibility  are, for Shepard, roads of no return.

I wanted to put together a series of stories as eclectic and inspiring as you might hear at a late-night party, Weber says, because the morning after, you feel a reason to continue, even if you dont know all the answers. Fittingly, the ninth volume of All-American (Little Bear Press, $140) is a casserole of conceits, from poetry and photojournalism to profiles on the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade and the doomed beatnik pretty-boy artist Bill Morrow. As ever, nature is never far in Webers search for the sublime: a paean to Big Sur features the strapping landscapes and characters that have made the place as synonymous with muscular naturalism as Weber himself.

On her Twitter account, Lady Gaga wrote on Thursday night that she was feeling dizzy and having trouble breathing and that paramedics later came and diagnosed of exhaustion and dehydration. She said her show, which has many coordinated moving parts and mechanical elements, would be too dangerous to perform because, she wrote, she had passed out earlier. Billboard said the Indiana show would be rescheduled for Jan 26; Lady Gagas Monster Ball tour is scheduled to go to Atlantic City on Saturday and play four shows at Radio City Music Hall next week.

The report, released on Thursday by NPD Group, said that over all the gaming industry had its best month ever in December, with more than $5.5 billion in sales of software, consoles and other hardware, and that the popular first-person shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 had become the fourth-best-selling game of all time. But for games that involve the use of plastic guitars instead of guns, the picture wasnt as rosy. The Beatles: Rock Band, which allows players to tap buttons along to the music of the Fab Four, has sold 1.18 million copies in the United States and 1.7 million copies worldwide since its release in September. By comparison, the music game Rock Band 2 sold 1.7 million copies in its first four months of release in 2008, and Guitar Hero: World Tour sold 3.4 million copies in that time.

And he has Audrey Hepburn to thank. As the story goes, he was visiting his linen-backer to restore some old Hepburn movie posters when the linen-backer asked if McCarthy knew Sean Hepburn Ferrer, the actresss son. He thought Sean might be interested in buying some of the posters, says McCarthy. And indeed, Ferrer bought a bunch of them. That was my first big sale. The introduction turned into a job for McCarthy as an archivist for the Hepburn foundation, and it prompted him to start his Web-based gallery, offering up some of his 3,000 vintage movie posters for sale. Hollywood and design insiders have quickly caught onto McCarthys astonishing collection of rare and foreign posters, many of them far more avant-garde than the standard-issue Hollywood versions. (Check out the Czech edition of Cool Hand Luke.) Besides continually adding to his collection, McCarthy (whose partner, Tyler Cassity, owns Hollywood Forever cemetery, where he hosts extremely popular movie nights in the summer) is planning a bricks-and-mortar gallery space to hold screenings and poster exhibitions based on particular stars, directors and genres.",2010-01-18T15:23:21+0000

On his weekly radio and television show, Mr. Chvez said, Those games they call PlayStation are poison. Some games teach you to kill. He added that violent video games are sold by capitalist countries so they can later sell weapons, and they promote the need for cigarettes, drugs and alcohol so they can sell them, according to Agence France-Presse. In October, Venezuela passed a law making it illegal to sell violent video games, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison.

A weary-looking Mr. Jean, who was born in Haiti and recently returned from a visit there, said in the video that he had always been committed to the people of that country. He is scheduled to be a host of Hope for Haiti, a benefit telethon that will be on many networks on Friday. In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Jean reiterated his defense of the foundation.

In the advertising market of those aged 18 to 49, the Globes perked up 10 percent  exactly what the network had predicted.

NBC said the audience was its largest in the time period, excluding sports, in six years.

I was at Madeleines Madteater  a kind of interactive dinner performance staged every few months in the neighborhood of Islands Brygge  eating nougat semifreddo while tightly wrapped together with a group of Danes in a stretchy white shroud, behind which waitstaff crept, caressing my back and pressing ghostlike faces through the fabric. There were lyrical strings and a dramatic chiaroscuro and a dancer undulating on the serving dais, and it was all gemtlichkeit, and ritual, and the sadness of endings, and  yes, I know this makes no sense. You had to be there. That is the point. Its art you experience with all five senses, the most satisfying performance in town. Madteater is precisely as its name translates: food theater.Unsurprisingly, Madeleines is named for Proust. The project, which started in 2006, is a collaboration between the chef Mette Sia Martinussen and the film production designer Nikolaj Danielsen, along with a board of directors that includes an anthropologist, a psychotherapist, a couple of artists and a neurology professor conducting research into the senses. But this is no gimmick; its still very much about the food. Martinussen has long occupied a prime spot in the Modern Scandinavian cooking scene. She co-owned the experimental restaurant Ester & Soja with Claus Meyer, the chef of Copenhagens beloved Noma. And in 2001 she and Danielsen opened a conceptual dining room called 1.th (First Floor to the Right), following it the next year with the experimental traveling restaurant MetteSias Sommerbus.

But the visitor  whose identity, or identities, has never been revealed, despite some claims to the contrary over the years  failed to show up this year for the first time, ending a strange crepuscular tradition and disappointing a crowd of more than 30 people who forfeited a good nights sleep to witness the visitation.

Some conjectured that the Poe Toaster, as the visitor has come to be known, might have just had the flu or car trouble. But Mr. Jerome spoke with a Poe-ian air of finality.

With this gift MoMA becomes the only institution outside of Europe to house a collection of drawings by Mr. Tschumi; the majority of his drawings are in the Archives of Modern Construction at the Lausanne Polytechnique, whose architecture school Mr. Tschumi founded in 1942, and in Basel in the collection of the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, formerly Sandoz, for which Mr. Tschumi built headquarters and laboratories in Switzerland and France.

The researchers were testing the impact of the drug when it was used as approved, at moderate doses in sick people.

Pork is of course on the menu, but so is stracciatella, the Roman chicken soup with thick strands of egg; cold antipasti; and entrees including a moist and flavorful plate of swordfish with mushrooms and fennel fronds, and another of crisp deviled chicken with black pepper and pickled chilies.

Five people immediately said, White.The students were arrayed around a flower-shaped table in the atrium of the museums education wing. Johansen had placed one sheet of paper in the center. What else? she asked. It has four sides. It has 90-degree angles. It is flat. This last response interested Johansen. She reclined gently on the table. How is it lying? If this were a person, what would you find yourself doing to it? Another student blurted out, It is like a baby.

us,Shocking! | The Proto-TMZ,"There are excerpts in Shocking True Story (Pantheon), a new history of the infamous and influential celebrity-scandal rag Confidential, that should strike you as straight out of a James Ellroy novel: the built-up glitz and the hard-boiled sleaze, to start, as well as something about the language  full of implication and insinuation, and as tart and pulpy as a blood orange. The author, Henry E. Scott, writes in the books acknowledgments that he was reading Ellroys L.A. Confidential when he became inspired to write about the magazine  which for five years in the 1950s incited paranoia in Hollywoods bedrooms and boardrooms with tightly sourced, stylized accounts of celebrity indiscretion. At the New York-based magazines height  which is to say just before its downfall at the hands of Tinseltown attorneys  it enjoyed a circulation of 9 million. Its pages laid the groundwork for the National Inquirer, E! and US Weekly; indeed, where once went Confidential, now goes TMZ.Not unlike an Ellroy novel, Shocking True Story sometimes delights in the macabre, particularly in the long passages it lifts from Confidentials pages. One article, from the magazines November 1954 issue, could almost describe a Jacques-Louis David painting from 150 years earlier: Police found her nude body in the bathroom of her San Francisco apartment. There was a grim touch of neatness, even comfort, in the way she had met death. After filling the tub with water, she had arranged a stack of pillows around the edge and drowned herself. The womans name was Dr. Jean S. Tatlock, and she was a communist. She killed herself in 1944, some six months after an overnight rendezvous with her former boyfriend, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. This wasnt news by late 1954, but it did endear Confidentials charismatic, power-peddling owner, Robert Harrison, to J. Edgar Hoovers F.B.I. and the forces of McCarthyism, who at a public hearing earlier that year stripped Oppenheimer of his Atomic Energy Commission security clearance.",2010-01-20T17:13:52+0000

Now Democrats are trying to figure out how they lost what was presumed to be the safest Senate seat in the country  it belonged to Ted Kennedy for 46 years  and how to avoid hemorrhaging others. A year after George W. Bushs chopper swung away from the Capitol and disappeared from sight, voters seem to have put his presidency behind them; theyre no longer willing to blame Republicans alone for high unemployment and rising gas prices, for home foreclosures and tuition hikes. The crises that Bush bequeathed to Democrats have now officially become theirs, and the notion of a great liberal realignment seems as retro as Friendster. A string of Democratic lawmakers, largely from rural and contested states, the kind of places that were supposed to now be more hospitable to Democrats than they were before, recently decided to pursue other careers rather than risk being turned out by wrathful voters. Party leaders who had once hoped to expand their majorities in November are now showing signs of panic as they scramble to stave off the prospect of crippling losses.",2010-01-20T18:01:50+0000

The governors proposal would cut funds to the New York State Council on the Arts by $6.5 million for its grant-making and by $600,000 for its administrative budget. In addition state support would be eliminated for the Egg performing arts center in Albany and begin to be phased out for the New York State Theater Institute in Troy.

On Wednesday, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that it had signed Marc Webb, above, the director of the hit romantic comedy (500) Days of Summer, to direct a fourth installment in its Spider-Man franchise, The Hollywood Reporter said. Last week news emerged that Sam Raimi, the director of the first three hit films about Spider-Man, and his star, Tobey Maguire, who plays the Marvel Comics hero and his alter ego, Peter Parker, were leaving the franchise over creative differences. Sony had said that it wanted to return the film series to the teenage roots of the Peter Parker character. In announcing that it had hired Mr. Webb, the studio said in a statement that it wanted a director who could capture the awe of being in Peters shoes so the audience could experience his sense of discovery while giving real heart to the emotion, anxiety and recklessness of that age.

The claim is included in a brief for a planned Friday hearing on whether Mr. Polanski, who in 1978 fled the United States before sentencing on a conviction of having sex with a minor, should now be entitled to sentencing in absentia. Politics seems to be interfering with the just administration of the law, wrote Mr. Polanskis lawyers, Chad S. Hummel and Bart Dalton, in response to a district attorneys brief arguing that Mr. Polanski should have to appear before sentencing. This month the Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, formed a committee to explore a run for California attorney general. Tuesdays filing did not specifically mention that possible run for state office, but it said the district attorneys insistence that Mr. Polanski return to the United States was a nakedly political approach to the case. Los Angeles prosecutors have long argued that Mr. Polanskis fugitive status deprived him of any right to challenge his treatment in California.",2010-01-20T22:37:01+0000

us,Time Change | Luxury Watches in Geneva,"I took a brief leave of the catwalks to take in the annual SIHH luxury watch preview in Geneva. The packed hallways and buzzing booths were a welcome contrast to the quiet post-crisis scene a year ago. As usual there were the requisite one-upmanships between brands. Some innovations were astounding, others simply showy. There was an equally strong emphasis on heritage and brand DNA, with many companies focusing on line extensions, as theyre called, or simply slight updates of existing styles.Some industry leaders took a break from bloat and put their watches on strict, chronograph-free diets, Biggest Loser style. Piagets new Altiplano was recently named the world record holder for the watch with the thinnest automatic movement, as well as the thinnest automatic case. Rival Vacheron Constantins new Patrimony Traditionale 1968 was named the worlds thinnest manual winding watch. Finally, Baume & Mercier clocked in with its new Classima Executive, measuring only 4.4 millimeters thick, with a lean price of $1,490 for the quartz-movement watch. These three made strong, sleek statements that can hold their own against more complicated competitors.Cartier introduced the Montre Calibre, featuring a chunkier case and the first in-house-designed and in-house-produced automatic movement. A. Lange & Sohnes Zeitwerk Phantom was inspired by a dinner in the dark held in Berlin during the introduction of the original Zeitwerk. A UV-transparent coating allows the absorption of light by the numerals hidden beneath the face to glow in the dark. Audemars Piguet took cues from the car-racing world for its Royal Oak Offshore Grand Prix. The auto-inspired detailing and graphics, plus a dark forged carbon case and bright red anodized aluminum face, made for a racetrack-worthy watch. In one of the most innovative watches of the show, Montblanc introduced the Metamorphosis, a Transformer-style watch that has to be seen to be believed (and explained). This two-faced watch, the result of a collaboration between expert watchmakers, features two dials that separate to reveal two more hidden dials with chronograph functions.From the chic and seemingly simple to the innovative and complicated, this years SIHH confirmed that the vitality of the watch business depends on tradition as much as innovation.",2010-01-21T20:41:30+0000

Historians are still puzzling over Annes downfall. Henry had fought for years to extricate himself from his first marriage and create a world where he and Anne could be husband and wife; to achieve it, he had split Christian Europe apart.

The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that the 501 Lounge in Montclair, N.J., hosted a Jersey Shore event on Friday night that drew an estimated 2,000 fans to the 800-person capacity club.

For example, for a skit in which Mr. OBrien appeared to bring the Kentucky Derby-winning horse Mine That Bird onstage while showing Super Bowl footage on a television screen, Ms. Dart said, the horse was a standard rental and the Super Bowl footage wasnt from the N.F.L. For a segment in which Mr. OBrien showed off an expensive Bugatti Veyron automobile while playing the Rolling Stones song Satisfaction, Ms. Dart said, The Bugatti was loaned to the show for free, and the music clearances were no different than the show gets for other pop tunes all the time. ?uestlove, the bandleader on NBCs Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, had written on Twitter that it cost The Tonight Show $500,000 to play the Beatles song Lovely Rita when Tom Hanks appeared on the show on Friday.

The group, National Veterans Legal Services Program, said the law required service members who had been separated from the military at least in part because of post-traumatic stress must receive disability ratings of at least 50 percent to receive benefits. At least 4,300 such veterans received ratings of less than 50 percent, according to a review by the Pentagon. In response to a lawsuit by the legal services program, a federal court last month ordered that those veterans be informed that they can ask to have their cases reviewed. Those with ratings of 30 percent or higher will become eligible for benefits, said Bart Stichman, co-executive director of the veterans group. Applications are at ptsdlawsuit.com.

The ""tough-minded, wintry"" production, which opened Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, is the first show in the Bridge Project's second season. ""Mr. Mendes's arrestingly somber staging of Shakespeare's pastoral comedy firmly favors adversity over sweetness,"" writes Charles Isherwood. ""For all the spirited comedy of 'As You Like It,' true love arrives only after strenuous study and emotional hardship."" Thankfully, comic relief does come in the form of the vagabond philosopher Jaques, played with ""sly and subtle wit by the terrific British actor Stephen Dillane."" Christian Camargo, Michelle Beck and Juliet Rylance also star in the play, which ""makes clear that the human heart is fickle, easily deceived, sometimes perfidious. The mettle of love must be tried and tested, and tried again, before its sweet felicities can be safely indulged.""",2010-01-27T03:18:33+0000

You could see how this latest defeat might have registered on Obama like a horse hoof to the abdomen, shaking him from his prized equanimity and plunging his White House into a spate of uncharacteristic self-doubt. On a personal level, Obama had to feel that he had somehow failed one of his mentors, allowing not only Kennedys seat to slip away but quite possibly his dream of national health care too. Politically, the Massachusetts election seems likely to presage worse days ahead, suggesting, as an unending parade of commentators have now pointed out, that Obama and his governing party could face a calamitous November.",2010-01-27T15:05:25+0000

Instead, Mr. Toibin has gone home a runner-up in the Costa book of the year competition, having lost to a poet. The Guardian reported that Christopher Reid was named the winner of the Costa award for his collection A Scattering, about his wife, Lucinda Gane, who died in 2005. Mr. Reid became only the fourth poet to win the prestigious British literary award &#8212 and its prize of about $48,000  following Douglas Dunn, Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney (who was the most recent poet to claim victory, in 1999). Josephine Hart, one of the prizes 11 jurors, told The Guardian, It is a devastating piece of work and all of us on the jury felt it was a book we would wish everybody to read. In addition to Brooklyn, other finalists for the award included Patrick Nesss childrens book The Ask and the Answer; Raphael Selbournes first novel, Beauty; and Graham Farmelos biography of the quantum physicist Paul Dirac, The Strangest Man.",2010-01-27T15:51:33+0000

At the hearing the judge,  Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York, denied a motion by Mr. Fairey to delay a deposition in a civil case while the criminal investigation was pending. In a letter obtained by The New York Times, a lawyer for Mr. Fairey also referred to a criminal investigation; also, The Associated Press said it had received a grand jury subpoena in the case. The letter requested that Tuesdays hearing be sealed, based on the fact that the motion relates to a grand jury investigation by the U.S. Attorneys office. The letter, signed by Meir Feder of the firm Jones Day, added that an open hearing on these issues would risk compromising the confidential nature of the criminal investigation. That motion was also denied. The legal dispute hinges on whether Mr. Fairey had the right to use an A.P. photo of Mr. Obama for his Hope poster.

Following my deployment to the northeastern region of the country in 2006-2007, I arrived at many of the same conclusions as he has over recent months. I believed that the faltering mission required a revamped approach, more troops, and more resources. Dealing with the dysfunctions of the U.S.-led effort, serving in an overstretched unit and suffering casualties in my platoon prompted my initial diagnosis. However, time, distance, and perspective from my experience have forced me to reconsider this assessment.President Obamas goals are sound. Training Afghan security forces, rewarding good governance, reducing corruption, supporting the rights of all Afghans, and strengthening the international coalition are vital to the fight against Al Qaeda. However, a fatal flaw plagues the counterinsurgency strategy adopted by the president: the more the U.S. and its allies deepen their involvement and commitment in Afghanistan, the more they undercut the Afghan sense of ownership, accountability and sustainability that will determine the long-term fate of the mission. Simply put, his strategy is directly at odds with his goals. ",2010-01-28T05:19:20+0000

On Monday, the government Web site of Zhangjiajie City in Hunan province said that it had changed the name of its Southern Sky Column to Avatar Hallelujah Mountains; the change was apparently an attempt to capitalize on the success of Avatar, which has earned more than $100 million in China. But according to Reuters, a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency said that the decision was unpopular with city residents, who accused officials of being money-oriented and blindly worshiping Western culture.

After Pollock, de Kooning and their peers in postwar American art established Abstract Expressionism, the precursory importance of prewar iconoclasts like Kandinsky became clear. After the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash blurted forth punk rock in the 1970s, a rude vision became apparent in the noise of 60s garage bands like the Seeds. ",2010-01-28T19:33:27+0000

Play it again, Sam is, whether intentionally or not, a doubly witty trope: suggesting both the action in the mind of Felix, replaying the role of Rick, and the action of Woody Allen himself, in creating a film that involves a parody of a theme from Casablanca. This very compression makes it easy to miss the implications of that title.

That speech drew 52.4 million viewers, while Wednesdays speech, which began at 9 p.m. and lasted until 10:20, appeared to have garnered an audience more similar in size to President Obamas prime-time address in December about the American strategy in Afghanistan, which drew 40.8 million viewers.

Reilly and Marisa Tomei as a couple whose relationship is threatened by her adult son, Jonah Hill, in the title role.

So I went to my local library, in Brighton, Mass., asked for Catcher, and was told that I would need a note of permission from my parents. The librarian glared at me as she said this. My mother, who was not a big reader herself, wrote a note saying I should be allowed to read whatever I wanted, which now seems one of her greatest gifts to me. That little piece of paper got me into the other, grownup side of the library, where I found a lot of books that opened my eyes and, I suppose, led me eventually to become a writer myself.

But because the shutterbug was Robert Mapplethorpe, who was soon to become fairly legendary himself, that exquisite photograph of Smith on the brink of fame is as close as New Yorks 1970s avant-garde ever came to a comparable twofer.

That placement has also, however, long made Paris vulnerable to flooding. The citys Roman name, Lutetia, is said to derive from the Latin word for mud (lutum), and one of its oldest neighborhoods, the Marais, was originally just that: a marsh. In 814, an unnamed author remarked that when God wants to punish the people of Paris by water, he sends such a flood and overflows the river Seine.

If the Indianapolis Colts prevail, the New Orleans institution will send the painting Ideal View of Tivoli, a 1644 work by Claude Lorrain, to Indianapolis for three months.
