us,The Screen: Golan's 'Escape to the Sun',"Current events, current problems, seem to spawn bad movies with some special generative power of their own. Films about war protest, ecology, race relations have all added their quota of bad faith to noble causes. And now, to treat the plight of Jewish intellectuals in Russia, which isn't a joke, comes Menahem Golan's ""Escape to the Sun,"" which is.Wholly reminiscent of the cold-war chase melodramas, ""Escape to the Sun"" assembles a cross-section of disaffected Russians who want to emigrate to Israel and can'tlegallyand pits them against the tormented cunning of one Soviet intelligence officer, a Major Kirsanov. The would-be emigrs include a professor (Peter Capell), an out-of-favor World War II air ace (John Ireland), an idealistic novelist (Jack Hawkins), assorted middle-aged folk and a pair of young lovers (Josephine Chaplin and Yuda Barkan) who are the real heroes of the movie. In other days and better movies their antagonist might have been Claude Raines, or even just Yul Brynner. But here it is Laurence Harvey, who brings to the evil enigmatic Kirsanov all the fascinating animation of a pillar of salt.It is easiest to fault ""Escape to the Sun"" on the quality of performance, which ranges from the professionally inept (Mr. Harvey) to the almost amateurish (Miss Chaplin) and which deals in a helpless pseudo-realism that has all the minor characters speaking with Russian accents but alows the major characters accentsBritish mostlyof their own. But it is the direction that really subverts the movie and keeps sinking it beneath the level, to which it might have aspired, of the merely routine.Given the premises of an adventure film that should always move, Menahem Golan generally stalls. A bit of intentionally fuzzy focus here, a distorting camera angle there, some clichd youthful lyricism, an agonized flashback""Escape to the Sun"" continually strives to be fancy without ever achieving competence. It knows exactly why its people are fleeing Russia, but is sloppy as to how. And it is wrong  philosophically wrongfor an escape movie to be clear as to the meaning of escape and so confused about the means.""Escape to the Sun"" opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater.",1972-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,'Trouble Man' Arrives,"""Trouble Man"" is a new white-financed black film starring Robert Hooks, one of the founders of New York's Negro Ensemble Company, as a supremely self-assured Los Angeles private eye known simply as Mr. T. It opened yesterday at the Juliet II and DeMille Theaters, and although it's a bad film, it represents such a peculiar collaboration of interests that it should be of concern to both black and white film sociologists. Also, it dramatizes such a wild confusion of values I'm not sure it wants to be described as cool or uppity.Because of the way ""Trouble Man"" sanctifies Mr. T and his successesthe loving care with which the camera explores his closets full of shirts, ties, shoes and $300 suitsthe film passes through the needs of black fantasy-feeding and comes out on the other side, as a four-square, all-American movie that urges the preservation of the rotten system that makes all the loot possible.In the most mindless fashion, this commercial film neutralizes not revolution but all sorts of other less cataclysmic social changes. Witness Mr. T and his woman, Cleo (Paula Kelly), who is supposedly a nightclub singer but so loves Mr. T that she refuses out-of-town engagements and spends all day lolling about her flat waiting for him to call. No matter that her hair is cut Afro, nor that the objets d'art surrounding her are African, She's still a house slave.Cleo never asks Mr. T what he doesin this case he's finding himself set up to be the fall guy in a gang war involving both blacks and whites. Cleo doesn't inquire because she knows that he knows that she would worry. And, of course, when she's in his arms, the world is quite all right. He's her kind of man, kind and gentle and helpful to the poor. That is, off-screen.On-screen, he's supercat, boozing (""a little gin with one ice cube""), turning on black women and white women (""Will I see you again?"" asks one. ""I'll think about it,"" he answers), and murdering anyone who gets in his way with an abandon that surpasses the demands of even this foolish plot.There have been other white-financed black films (including ""Shaft"") that have done more or less the same thing, in a similar fashion. The thing that distinguishes ""Trouble Man"" is the strong implication that the squalid conditions of Mr. T's world are worth protecting for the big payoffs to the lucky ones who beat the system, who can surmount the conditions.In the film's climactic sequence, set in the ultramodern Century City of Beverly Hills, Mr. T single-handedly knocks off all the members of a mob of white gangsters who are holed up in the ultraposh Century Plaza. On the one hand, the action is that of the conventional black private-eye film, but the scenery looks like the illustrations for a prospectus for Century City, where, if we are good and don't rock the boat, we may all be able to live some day. Either Century City, or some place just like it.""Trouble Man"" is a horrible movie, but it's worth thinking about.",1972-11-02T05:00:00+0000

The Philippines, where both were filmed in vivid colors, is scenic and arresting, and provide a good deal more interest than the films' jerry-built plots.""Superbeast,"" a fiction that borrows from ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" has a pathologist, Antoinette Bower, deep in the rain forest after those mutants who have been killing innocent citizens. Well, she discovers an expatriate American researcher, Craig Littler, who has come up with an elixir, not yet perfected, to rehabilitate criminals. But he's being subsidized and practically held captive by Harry Lauter, a rich, American hunting nut, who doesn't want them cured but would rather stalk and kill them.Forget about those eminent screams in the night and those mutants, who, like the scientist, get to look like Mr. Hyde. Mr. Littler, an improbable scientist, is as handsome as any Esquire model. Miss Bower, who occasionally appears to be somewhat vague about the dire goingson, is fetching in tight slacks. And the Philippines never looked lovelier.There's an improbability about ""Daughters of Satan"" too. Our hero, Tom Selleck, is also an intellectual, a buyer for museums, who latches on to a 16th-century painting of witches burning because one of them is a dead ringer for his pretty bride, Barra Grant. Why this should lead a coven of local, modern witches, including Tani Phelp Guthrie and Paraluman, to entice Miss Grant into satanic shivarees, eventually becomes obviousso we can have some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, a few, obligatory seminude scenes and explicitly sexy talk.Miss Grant and Miss Guthrie are photogenic, if little else, and Mr. Selleck, a handsome, virile, mustachioed type, is natural in his confusion about the bewitchery.

No tribute came from either the Italian or United States Government for Pound, who broadcast from Italy during World War II on behalf of Italy's Fascist government.

us,The Screen: 'Valachi Papers' Arrives:Work Covers 30 Years of Criminal History Bronson in Lead Role of Mafia Informant,"Often ludicrous and often just dull, Terence Young's ""The Valachi Papers"" has the look of a movie project that ran short of ideas before it was finished, and ran short of class almost before it was begun. It is the only gangster movie of recent memory in which the hoods still say ""dese"" and ""dose,"" and which simulates an Italian accent by adding ""a"" to the ends of words: ""You live by the knife and the gun-a. You die by the knife and the gun-a!""They are the words of Salvatore Maranzano, founder of the organization known as Cosa Nostra, initiating Joe Valachi into his Family. Maranzano, a devout intellectual, is over-played by Joseph Wiseman, rather as if he were Dante Alighieri trembling outside the gate of Hell. Actually, Maranzano mutters a good deal of classical sounding Italian, and before his untimely dispatch (Sept. 10, 1931; multiple knife and gunshot wounds) I half expected him to intone ""Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate""""Leave all hope, ye who enter."" He never does, but that might be a useful motto to put over the doors of theaters showing ""The Valachi Papers.""The film is of course based on the testimony of the Mafia soldier turned informant, Joe Valachi, and on Peter Maas's popular book. ""The Valachi Papers."" It covers more than 30 years of American criminal history, and it abounds in simulations of real people and events. It is finicky as to dates and often fanciful as to detail. For example, in a sequence showing crooks murdered in 1929, one will show up slumped over the wheel of a 1960's model car. To brazen this out, as the film attempts to do, seems like laziness raised to the level of willful contempt.The real mystery of ""The Valachi Papers"" is how anything so bad could have come from the efforts of so many good people. Not only Mr. Wiseman, normally a fine actor, but also Charles Bronson (as Valachi), Lino Ventura (as Vito Genovese), and others  all seem to be working out of their proper idiom. Terence Young (""Dr. No,"" ""Wait Until Dark,"" etc.) has directed competently before this. And Stephen Geller, the scenarist, has, in ""Slaughterhouse Five,"" previously written a useful screenplay.But in ""The Valachi Papers"" everyone undoes himself.

Some of the assassinations and violent confrontations are so clumsy that they look like a return to primal innocence, or ignorance.

us,The greening of a stable,"Gardens are blooming indoors as never before; even architecture is being influenced by the desire to live amid a small jungle. Joan and Marvin Goody, a husbandandwife architectural team, used the idea of an indoor greenhouse as the focus in redesigning their carriage house, creating a central well topped by an acrylic skylight, as a haven for plants on two levels. The old building. in Boston's Beacon Hill district, dates from 1875 and was originally a twostory stable and carriage house. Standing at the entrance to a charming mews and across from a small commons (below), it is an oddly shaped, triangular structure that had never been used as a dwelling until its owners took it over four years ago. (Until 1920, carriages were regularly hoisted by a handpowered elevator for storage in the secondfloor loft.) The Goodys had to build a complete house within the existing redbrick shell. In some places, Mrs. Goody says. the new studs and dry wall are holding up the outside walls. To gain a proper residence for themselves, while keeping the ground floor as a rental unit, the architects added a third story to the building, capping it with a mansard roof that maintains the traditional character of the old historic streets. The live plants are the most important feature of the interior design. The glass partitions originally planned around the well of greenery were never installed because the owners found that people and plants both thrive in similar conditions of humidity and light. Thus the garden is open, to be enjoyed from the combined kitchen, dining and living room and from the balcony above.",1972-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,' Roma' -- The Faces Are Perhaps Too Familiar:Too Familiar 'Roma'?,"""FELLINI'S ROMA,"" now at the Ziegfeld Theater, is properly titled: the city that Federico Fellini explores for almost two hours bears little resemblance to the real Rome. When Fellini takes his camera crew into the streets and reality threatens, the exuberant director does everything possible to destroy the illusion, as if such a thing would be impossibly poor form. Instead, the film is Fellini's free-flowing valentine to the Rome of his imagination, of his memory and especially of his movies. It's a testament to the unique properties of films, and a gigantic advertisement for himself.""Fellini's Roma"" is also incredibly lovely, yet after a while it's depressing. It's like watching a gallant old prince auction off the contents of his palazzoboth too cheaply and much too readily, since his creditors really aren't that desperate. As the extraordinary things are carried out and put on display, you recognize them with love, laughter and a good deal of shock.Item: Childhood (Fellini's, in Rimini), a period when the little Federico was terrorized by almost everything, but especially by his father, his teachers, the priests; when Fellini's Rome was a dream fed by slide lectures of Roman landmarks, and by visits to the Rimini movie theater (""Two adults, three children and one maid,"" his father tells the ticket seller), to see spectacles about Nero and Poppaea and moon-faced centurions who joined their Christian sweethearts down amongst the lions.Item: Whores (all sizes and shapes, but aging fat ones are the most plentiful) in two different whore houses, one poor, one expensive, both being elaborations on a little boy's guilt-ridden fantasies as recalled by the maestro, who now laughs at his old self, the old whores, the old times, with affection, irony, compassion and unflagging interest.Item: One midget. ""See my tiny grandmother,"" a little girl says to the young Federico (Peter Gonzales) when he arrives at the strange Roman pensione in which he is to stay on his first visit. The girl opens a door and there, indeed, is a teeny-weeny old lady who is apparently used to being put on display.Item: Roman decadence (various forms). Most spectacular is an ecclesiastical fashion show (the high-point of a Roman princess's at-home for a dark-glasses-wearing cardinal), with the models (priests, nuns, bishops, cardinals) on roller skates, displaying habits made of lam, of mirrors and of more conventional cloth, in styles that suggest what might happen if Elizabeth Taylor suddenly became the Vatican's wardrobe mistress. The excesses are positively stunning.Item: Roman food and table manners. An extended sequence that recalls the friendliness, robustness and sheer grossness of Roman appetites. This time they are the appetites of the lower orders.Item: A recollection of the old music halls that Fellini remembers from the early days of World War IIuncertain refuges for third-rate talents on their way up, second-rate talents on their way down, and audiences for whom rudeness is the highest form of self-expression.And so it goes in a movie that is one part travelogue, two parts memoire, and all fantasy.The film includes one of the most vivid and mad sequences Fellini has ever shot, a rush-hour ride into Rome on a rainy evening undertaken by Fellini and his cameramen, one of whom is perched on a camera boom that swoops down into the traffic and then high into the air, observing, always observing as we observe it, dressed in a pink plastic rain shield that looks like a prop from ""Juliet of the Spirits,"" in jams of pushcarts, Fiats, trucks and busses. We catch sight of a dog run over and forgotten, of a political demonstration, of a terrifying too-muchness of everything that must eventually bring Rome, the world and Fellini to a halt.""Roma,"" is as free as any film Fellini has made, including ""The Clowns,"" which, next to this new film, looks like a model of disciplined joy. ""Roma"" is free, all right, but it's not free in the way of quick sketches and exercises made for some future work, although I have a feeling Fellini has something like that in mind. Perhaps a new form of cinema journalism. Everything in ""Roma"" too easily recalls things already seen, Fellini films already made. Somewhere or another, they all are there in ""Roma""including ""Variety Lights,"" ""La Strada,"" ""Cabiria,"" ""La Dolce Vita,"" ""8,"" ""Toby Dammit"" and ""Satyricon.""Fellini, like all good directors, has a limited number of concerns to which he returns repeatedly, with variations. If you admire his earlier films, as I do, and care about the talent that made them, it's a little sad to see him spending so much time and effort in ""Roma,"" not re-exploring those concerns, but simply recycling them, along with camera shots and faces.",1972-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Along the way he nurses his ancient car, keeps calling home (no answer), picks up a girl hitchhiker, gives her the car and sees her taken into custody at a checkpoint by British soldiers.He continues into Belfast by foot and borrowed rides. He arrives too late for his mother's death but just in time to be arrested under the Special Powers Act, by which suspects may be detained incommunicado and without recourse to judicial proceeding.About the arrest, imprisonment and torture we have known from the beginning, by way of a series of flashes forward that keep interrupting the drive to Belfast. But the reason for the arrest, and whether Sean actually is an exiled revolutionary, we do not knowor at least we are never told. Sean says very little and very little is said about him. ""U-Turn"" is full of overheard talkin pubs, on Dublin streetsbut about its central action it is almost silent and very secretive.The characterization of Sean, by Brendon Ellis, enforces a sense of secretiveness, as with shy, slightly sullen persistence he avoids saying what he is about and what, besides his mother's sickness, motivates him. Sean might almost inhabit the private spaces typical of the later films of Robert Bresson, and if ""U-Turn"" were a better movie, Bresson's cinema would be a logical comparison.Bresson's cinema is made up not merely of ideas, but also of a marvelously precise judgment for feeling and gesture and of a passion  spiritual or romantic that there is a point in being secretive about. None of this, neither the precision nor the passion is evident in ""U-Turn,"" which ultimately fails to rise above its intentional ordinariness, its concern with a trivial objectivity.Despite the great public issues at stake, the film doesn't seem to have found a way of annexing a subject; though it has a Subject at hand. This is not uninteresting film making; but it is too tentative, and in a sense too modest, for its own ambitions.""U-Turn,"" the first venture of Dave Vadehra, an Indian film maker now living in America, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum.",1972-11-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: A Chinese 'Fist of Fury':Stark Tale of Revenge Opens at Pagoda Shanghai Is Setting for Kung-Fu Combats,"""Fist of Fury"" landed with a bang and quite a few whimpers yesterday at Chinatown's Pagoda Theater to illustrate that some Orientals aren't particularly inscrutable. Despite a concentration on the rough Kung-Fu form of hand-to-hand combat and other vaguely exotic matters, this import from Hong Kong subtitled in English (and Chinese for the Cantonese who can't follow its Mandarin dialogue) proves as in, say, ""Batman"", that the bad guys don't stand a chance against the good guys.Lo Wei, the writer-director, offers some lip service to national pride as the young members of the Chinese Kung-Fu school battle villainous Japanese trying to destroy their organization, although it's difficult to discern from the studio sets that it's all happening in 1908 Shanghai. In a simplistic story that is performed in similarly stark, obvious style, the hero, a master of Kung-Fu with a low boiling point, avenges the murder of his revered teacher with an clat that would charm Superman.Reportedly a box-office smash in the Orient, ""Fist of Fury"" is, in effect, Bruce Lee's personal dish of tea. And the handsome, 32-year-old actor, a reputed Kung-Fu expert with the muscular build of a welterweight champ, doesn't let the Kung-Fu lovers down. He is decidedly an eye-catching figure as he takes on all comers, singly or in whimpering groups, in stylized, Karate-like bouts with swift, balletic moves, baleful stares, deadly flying fists and legs and, of course, all the necessary eerie shouts.He also has some moments of subdued, romantic dalliance with Miao Ker Hsiu, a Kung-Fu colleague who's a real doll by any standards. But Mr. Lee's heart is obviously elsewhere. The main thrust here is action, while he and the rest of the cast are fairly casual about love and national pride. And, while Chinese films are plentiful in Chinatown, the action here is as black-and-white and as pleasantly, if naively, diverting as that in any western even though it was all shot in vivid colors.",1972-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Ken Russell's 'Savage Messiah,' Biography of a Sculptor, Opens","""I want to take the 'mystique' away from art and show that success is usually 5 per cent inspiration and 95 per cent perspiration and hard slog""Ken Russell, the director of ""Savage Messiah,"" quoted in studio publicity material.Publicity brochures aren't notable for their accuracy, and I wouldn't bet that Ken Russell actually made that statement, but whoever did had certainly seen ""Savage Messiah,"" Mr. Russell's film biography of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, the French sculptor who died in the trenches of World War I at the age of 24. ""Savage Messiah"" is, first and foremost, a hard slog movie.""Art is alive!"" young Henri shouts at one point. ""Love it or hate it, but don't worship it!"" ""Art is above sex!"" screams someone else, apropos of just what I've now forgotten.Yet for all of these definitions of art, or of what art should be above, ""Savage Messiah"" is much less interested in information, or even in the creative process, than in Gaudier-Brzeska's relationship with Sophie Brzeska, the Polish woman twice his age with whom he carried on what the publicity brochure insists on describing as a strange affair. Time was when a strange affair might have suggested one of those loves that dare not speak its name, say mother-with-son or sister-with-sister.We're now so liberated that ""strange"" here refers to an affair of such intense platonism that although Henri and Sophie joined their names, they never slept together. The merest suggestion that they might, according to Mr. Russell, would be enough to send Sophie into hysterics, as well as to her purse, for when Henri got too worked up, she'd finance his visits with street-walkers, which were the best that she could afford.As played by Dorothy Tutin, who has the pinched, pointy profile of a hickory nut and a voice that would command attention in a hurricane, Sophie is a riveting figure to watch, even though we seldom have the slightest idea of what's going on in her head. Which is an odd lack in a film by Russell who, in films like ""The Music Lovers"" and ""The Devils,"" hasn't hesitated to dramatize states of emotion in ways that were sometimes courageous and more often monstrously foolish.A handsome, very young English actor named Scott Antony plays Gaudier-Brzeska as if he were auditioning for ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" with much leaping about in the conventional fashion of the artist as a young man. Lines that should stick in his throat don't as when he shouts to Sophie as they are being bodily evicted from the Louvre: ""Let them keep it pure and air-conditioned for the American tourist!"" This, of course, in 1911.Russell takes the mystique away from art, but supplies nothing much in its place. We see Henri chopping away all night on a piece of graveyard marble that apparently becomes one of his best-known pieces, ""Torso,"" but we learn little about London's avant-garde Vorticist movement with which he was identified.In passing, Henri makes a few nasty remarks about Michelangelo, about French impressionists, but except for a couple-of pencil sketches and a brief montage of his sculptures at the end, we haven't a clue as to what Gaudier-Brzeska was up to, or why his reputation has soared since his death.Although the performances are full of hysteria, ""Savage Messiah"" is so tame that it almost makes one long for the excesses of the earlier Russell films, which so overwhelmed the senses as to become anesthetically soothing, like loud rock. At one point in the film, I had the feeling that perhaps Russell was really taking stock of his career to date.How else to explain the speech he puts into Henri's mouth: ""You can always tell a bad artist, like a bad doctor: he surrounds his work with a certain amount of hocus-pocus.""",1972-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Franklin's play, ""Black Girl"" opened off Broadway in 1971 it received very favorable reviews, and it ran for six months at the Theater de Lys. Not having seen the play, I don't know how much has been lost in the transition from stage to screen. But I suspect that a good deal has been lost, because Ossie Davis's film version, adapted by Miss Franklin herself, is not only a poor movie; it is a poor movie that makes it look as if there never had been a good play.Billie Jean, the black girl of the title, is a recent high school dropout and aspiring ballet dancer who lives at home in a Southern suburb with her mother, Mama Rosie, her two (older) half-sisters, her grandmother, and a mild-mannered man named Herbert  who loves the grandmother and helps with the rent. Mama Rosie has never been able to suppress a soft spot for other people's children. Her special favorite, Netta, a neighbor's daughter, is now in college getting an educationmuch to the disgust of the half-sisters, who despise Netta and education, in that order.Netta wants to save Billie Jean, to get her into college and into dance education. The half-sisters want to ruin Billie Jeanto get her into sex and perhaps early pregnancyfor no discernible reasons except jealousy and a well-practiced love of mischief for its own sake. There is much, much more going on in ""Black Girl,"" notably the story of Mama Rosie and her estranged husband, Earl, but its central action is the conflict between Netta and the half-sisters over the future of Billie Jean. It is an action that combines elements of Cinderella with the sort of middle-class social-aspiration melodrama prominent in the 1930's. But in the 1930's, the hero might have been Jewish and male, and his aim might have been medical school.One of the problems with ""Black Girl"" is that going up seems so much less attractive than staying down. Netta, at least in Leslie Uggams's too genteel characterization, looks less like success than like loss of identity. The half-sisters accuse her of virginity, and they may be right. They, on the other hand, have no apparent mtier beyond wasting timewhich allows them to sharpen their wits and get off the best lines.Some of the acting is very good. Peggy Pettitt, a newcomer, as a quite complicated Billie Jean; Gloria Edwards as the more evil of the half-sisters; above all, Brock Peters as the rich, nimble, sweet-talking Earl. On the stage, Earl apparently disgraced the family by managing a whorehouse; in the movie, he runs a shoe store, and the reasons for his expulsion by Mama Rosie aren't so clear.But I suspect that the real difference between the successful play and the failed movie lies in Ossie Davis's direction, which ranges from pedestrian to downright helpless. Sloppy editing, awkward confrontations, dull and obvious camera techniqueall are the director's responsibility. From time to time you can almost feel the actors asking for stage management. They don't get itand that, in a work not without some interest, seems a pity.""Black Girl"" opened yesterday at the Penthouse Theater, the 59th Street and 85th Street Twin I cinemas.",1972-11-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Kotto's 'Limit':Subject of Moderation Comes to Criterion,"Yaphet Kotter's new movie, his first as a director, is called ""The Limit."" It might better have been called ""The Center,"" because although it deals in contemporary violence, its real subject is the power of a sane pacific moderation. Though never anything special, it is an oddly pleasant, occasionally exciting movie to watch.Kotto is his own leading man. As Mark Johnson, a decent black Los Angeles motorcycle cop (the film was originally called ""Speed Limit: 65,"" also a poor title) with a white cop (Quinn Redeker) as best friend, and a girl (Pamela Jones) who loves him, his life consists of major satisfactions and only minor irritations until he runs afoul of a motorcycle gang headed by one Big Donnie (Ted Cassidy). Though a bike bum by profession, Big Donnie has a streak of innate nobility. He also has a very pregnant, kvetchy motorcycle mama (Corinne Cole) who wants him to quit riding and start working so he can support her.But when Big Donnie awkwardly, tentatively approaches Johnson for advice, trouble brews among the bikers. Led by a second in command (Virgil Frye) they begin to threaten Mark Johnson's girl and Big Donnie's unborn babyand there follows a multiple revenge climax that is familiar in its elements, but is more restrained, less violent than most.The last third of the movie is a little difficult to follow. It seems to have been heavily cut, edited almost into insensibility, and this, in a film largely about moral relationships, proves very nearly fatal.Nevertheless, it seems worth saying a word for ""The Limit,"" a film absolutely without pretenses, relatively without illusions, shocking only in its ability to find occasions for good feeling. Yaphet Kotto, though very inexpert, isn't the world's worst director. His achievement here has been not to rise above, but to humanize and slightly enliven the formulas that govern this kind of movie making.""The Limit"" opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater.",1972-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Abstraction Prevails in Film Forum Shorts,"In its latest collection of avant-garde short subjects, that mecca for experimentalists, the Film Forum, is illustrating again the theory that the abstract can speak more loudly, if not necessarily more clearly, than words. And if Stan Brakhage, a master of the so-called ""subjective"" camera, who has been at this specialized moviemaking for more than 20 of his 39 years, is the nominal star attraction of the program, he is also its most abstract contributor.In ""The Riddle of Lumen,"" his individual technique illuminates his definition of the film as ""a quest for an understanding of the nature of light and vision."" Vision and color are artistically heightened as he captures varying light on objects, people, water, streets, skies and forest. But there seems to be more riddle than meaning in ""The Process,"" his abstruse, staccato succession of quick cuts, lights, flashes, color panels, negative film and vaguely perceived human figures.While she is equally abstract, Rosalind Schneider, a painter, evokes visual pleasure in both ""Orbitas"" and ""Still Life,"" studies of color and objects that often come vividly alive through her sensitive handling of her somewhat mysterious subjects.The most professionally rounded works of the eight 16mm. films on the bill, to this viewer, at least, are John Steinberg's ""Trees"" and ""Water."" His varied vignettes of shimmering autumn foliage and rippling seascapes may be repetitive on occasion, but they most often are observations of nature that are lucid and lyrical, not commonplace.Uncommon man is tackled in Vlatko Gilic's Yugoslav-made ""One More Day,"" an eerie documentation of swarms of vilalgers wallowing in the mud and waters of a pond, presumably seeking cures for their ills. It is a fragmentary report, but its somber mood and ritualistic overtones are sharp and arresting. And in ""Christopher Tree,"" Les Blank's observations of the titular musician who plays an amazing number of gongs, bells, cymbals and tympani against a sylvan setting, the subject and his music are unusual even if the camera work isn't.The Film Forum's package from the moviemaking underground is, as usual, interesting, but its parts are a good deal better than the whole.",1972-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Nixon's remarks were understandably filled with references to the popular will as he clearly expected it to be demonstrated the following Tuesday. But since he has yet to show himself the slave of a philosophy, any philosophy, when it appears to conflict with the political facts of life, what he told his interviewer may well be reconsidered in the light of the mandate he received at the polls. That mandate already has been interpreted as variously as tea leaves; but in spite of the lopsided vote for the President, an interpretation would have to be farfetched indeed to read the election as an upsurge of Victorian conservatism.",1972-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Most curious of all, in the corpse's mouth is a pink granite stone about the size of a hen's egg, which the narrator, retired schoolteacher Dunstan Ramsay, had presented to Boy earlier on the evening of his death, in the pres ence of another old acquaintance, the famous illusionist Magnus Eisengrim.

us,'Ulzana's Raid':Aldrich Directs Cast Led by Lancaster,"Because film reviews in newspapers are essentially news storiesthat is, reports about what happened yesterday, to whom and whereone is required to describe at least something of the plot of Robert Aldrich's ""Ulzana's Raid.""However, I'll do it briefly because the very ordinary plot does not do justice to the complexity of the film itself. ""Ulzana's Raid"" is a Western whose conventional outlines have been rather violently and beautifully bent by Mr. Aldrich, an unreconstructed misogynist (""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"") even when he makes movies (such as ""The Dirty Dozen"") dealing exclusively with men. On second thought, it may be that Mr. Aldrich doesn't really hate women. It could be that he feels they clutter up and, in effect, deny the dark side of the world where his most interesting films inevitably take place.""Ulzana's Raid,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum and other theaters around town, is the story of an ill-fated flight and almost equally ill-fated pursuit, about a tough old Indian fighter (Burt Lancaster) and a callow young cavalry lieutenant (Bruce Davison) and their mission to track down an Apache named Ulzana who, with nine braves, has fled the reservation to murder, rape and find the Indian equivalent of identity. Why, the lieutenant asks his Apache scout, do Apaches kill so cruelly and wantonly? Says the scout: ""Man give up power when he die. Like fire and heat.""Like many Aldrich films, including the recent ""The Grissom Gang,"" the new film plays Russian roulette with itself, not with bullets but with ludicrous lines, and with violence that is so excessive that it comes close to self-parody. Aldrich fans tend either to be humorless (like his worst critics) or to admire (as I do) the daring with which he so consistently courts disaster by turning an ordinary story into (in this case) a winner-take-nothing parable.Although ""Ulzana's Raid"" deals in the kind of narrative suspense and shock that would keep the most unsophisticated 42d Street audience awake, the film is as bleak as its Arizona landscapes. Much of the screenplay, written by Alan Sharp, depends on the pride and moral breakdown of the young lieutenant, an Eastern minister's son who is completely out of his element. Aldrich's West is a timeless place where noble motives lead to disastrous actions. Loyalties are hopelessly confused and the only possible satisfaction in life is behaving well for the immediate moment.This Burt Lancaster does with ease, along with Bruce Davison, Richard Jeackel and the rest of the predominantly male cast. Of the three women I remember in the film, one is shot to death so she can't be raped by Indians, a second is raped and turned into a raving lunatic, and the third, the Indian girl who plays Lancaster's mistress, is seen only from the eyes up. ""Ulzana's Raid"" has little time for sentiment.",1972-11-16T05:00:00+0000

us,'Moonwalk One' -- A Record and Essay,"Theo Kamecke's ""Moonwalk One,"" which opened Monday at the Whitney Museum, is in part a record of, in part a speculation about, man's first landing on the moon, in July, 1969. Given the event, and given the nature of the medium, the film does better as record than as speculation. I'm not sure but that a straight documentary on Apollo 11, using some of this material, might not have been more meaningful as well as more informative. But ""Moonwalk One"" is what we have, and there is a lot to be taken from it.Necessarily, the film covers a lot of familiar territory, though not always from familiar points of view: the countdown, lift-off, flight, moon landing, return, triumphant homecoming  the by now almost ritual drama of space flightrecounted now with additions and changes. The tourist crowds around Cape Kennedy, the VIP's in NASA's official bleachers, the solemn preparation of the astronauts; space flight as public show and private adventureon just this level, ""Moonwalk One"" handles its contrasts and its ironies with tact and considerable intelligence.But on other levels it flounders. And whenever it attempts to face the meaning rather than the mechanics of its event it tends to descend into ponderous banalities both in narration (e.g., Around the world, another morning . . . not so different from the morning beforeor tomorrow moning . . ."") and in accompanying image (Indian farmers, African tribesmen. European office workersall going about their business while the sun rises and Apollo 11 is made ready on the launch pad. . . . At its worst and most pretentious the film seems bent on evoking Stanley Kukrick's ""2001,"" as if to force the insight that life imitates art.In general, one wishes there were less of Stonehenge (""Dawn remembers again the magic circle . . ."" etc.) and more about practical hardware. At moments ""Moonwalk One"" is genuinely awe-inspiring, and those are always moments of precise technical concentration. The ascent of the lunar module seen from the command ship; the manufacture of the space suits (a fascinating and oddly moving sequence), above all, the lift-off of Apollo 11 itself, photographed by automated cameras from the launch tower and looking like a rehearsal for the end of the worldthese are the film's serious pleasures, and I think that on balance they are worth all the trivially profound and prophetic dross.",1972-11-16T05:00:00+0000

That prose is intimate and informative at once, opinion ated but humor ous, and melodious. It has a dreamlike quality, too, and it may be no accident that Richard Wagner took his themes of The Flying Dutch man and of Tannhaeuser from Heine. At this point, Heine editions in several vol umes are again available to every student in the Federal Republic, although it would perhaps be more useful if separate editions of his major works, for instance, Lutetia (on France), were available as paperbacks. East Germany has taken considerable inter est in the works of the poet, who was a friend of Karl Marx and Friedridh Engels. A mammoth edition of all of Heine's output, known as the Saekularausgabe, is nearing volume 27 at East Berlin's Academieverlag.

us,"Please Stand By,' a Parody of Activism","""Please Stand By,"" which opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema, is the first feature movie of Jack and Joanne Milton, a pleasant young couple, both teachers, who have been variously involved in TVcommercial production and magazine publishing. Though shot in 16-mm, and, I should think, on a fairly tight budget, ""Please Stand By"" has about it such an air of professional public relations that I can't help feeling that its creators' backgrounds have something to do with the failure of an ambitious but ultimately very bad-movie.It is a fantasy fiction film about a group of young New York activists led by one Freemont Zappata (the street singer David Peel) and his girl, Marian (Wendy Appel), who hijack special equipment with which they can interrupt network television for brief periods in order to broadcast their own counter-culture messages.They succeed for a while, but a spy in their midst betrays their location, and Freemont is captured by the Feds, who transport him to an island detention center off the coast of New Rochelle. But after a trial, conviction and much tedious film time, Freemont is sprung by his friends, who then go back to their noncommercials. Alone, and dressed in black, Freemont rides off on horseback along a Pelham Bay bridle pathan El Topo of the Bronx.There is a certain amount of specific movie parody in ""Please Stand By,"" most extensively and depressingly of the eating-seduction sequence in ""Tom Jones."" But the whole film is really dependent on parody from beginning to endparody sex, parody adventure, parody politics, even parody radicalismand it is saddening to see a movie ostensibly committed to freedom of thought and expression so tied to the superficial repetition offormulas.I think there is much to be said against any revolutionary movement whose primary aim is to put itself on television. But the media freaks in ""Please Stand By"" seem especially reprehensible because their subversive messages turn out to be little collage-animations attacking war and consumerism, and supporting peace, love and ecological sanity. There is nothing here that might not do, say, for a public-service spot during the ""Joe Franklin Show."" This is the kind of rebellion that might secretly hope for a contract with C.B.S. next year.But the Miltons obviously posses the executive skills necessary to make a movie, and there are moments in ""Please Stand By"" that are technically impressive if nothing else. The cast, when it is performing rather than rapping, seems competent, and Wendy Appel, a very beautiful woman, gives the impression that she may also be an actress of real interest.",1972-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Mechanic,' About a Professional Killer:Bronson Plays Role in Winner Movie Director Concentrates on Chase Spectacles","""The Mechanic,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and other theaters, is about Arthur Bishop (Charles Bronson), a cool professional killer who lives in lonely splendor in the Hollywood hills, with a pool in his living room and an ache in his heart. Although Arthur is a genius at planning the accidental deaths of others (including an old associate, on whom a contract has been let), and although he spends a lot of time keeping fit (jogging, handball, karate, flying a plane), something is awfully wrong in Arthur's life.He suffers such fits of acute anxiety that he sometimes faints, and he can make it with his call-girl friend only when she creates elaborate fantasies about his sex appeal. Arthur even looks funny: he has the face and physique of a man of 50 who takes immense care of himself, but his hair is of a blackness and a consistency that suggest that Arthurfor the sake of vanitydunks it in pitch.There are indications in Lewis John Carlino's screenplay that this effect is intentional, that ""The Mechanic"" is meant to be something more than the solemn, rather spurious action melodrama that Michael Winner, the director, has made of it.The center of the film is the relationship between Arthur and the rich young punk Steve (Jan-Michael Vincent), whom Arthur takes on as his apprenticewith not too surprising results. However, while Carlino's screenplay suggests a fatal fatherson rivalry between the pair, and sort of hints at a latent homosexual bond, the film that Winner has directed is one of non-stop, mostly irrelevant physical spectacle, of complicated chases (in automobiles, on motorcycles), of shootouts, and of various explosions (buildings, cars, yachts). It's quite possible the same movie could have been put together by the special effects men and the stunt coordinators.Because Winner, an Englishman whose first Hollywood-based film this is, is the sort of director who can never resist a flashy effect, no matter what it does to the point of the film, I found myself even mistrusting the dcor in ""The Mechanic.""Is that over-designed, over-decorated house of Arthur's really meant to be as failed-Playboy as it seems, or is it supposed to be chic? For that matter, is Arthur supposed to look grotesque, like an aging Hollywood agent, in his fancy bell-bottoms and leather jackets, or is this a mark of his hipness?I couldn't tell from the film, though I suspect that another, tougher director might have made something quite interesting of the same script.",1972-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Even with the ommission of Ammons's longest continuous work, Tape for the Turn of the Year (1965), this is a remark able book, enriched by three long poems (together almost 80 pages) that must have been composed since Up lands (1970) and Briefings (1971). Indeed, with Hibernaculum, 112 stanzas in length, a high point of the poet's delayed career is reached. His first book, Ommateum (Com pound Eye), caused no stir when it appeared in 1955; and even the mid sixties' explosion of Expressions at Sea Level (1964), Corson's In let (1965) and Northfield Poems (1966) did not make of him an in escapable presence.

It's not difficult. Here is what you do: If there is easy access to a shredder or grinder, this is the first step to quick com post. Or the power mower can be run back and forth over thick leaf coverage to grind up leaves to chunkier bits. Then select site that is out of the way, but easily ac cessible with wheelbarrows or garden carts for hauling raw and finished material. A fence or cinder blocks to confine the com post area helps to keep things tidy and to keep out playful pets and wild animals. The Indore process is the most practical for foliage. For a foundation, lay a layer of brush such as hedge or tree trimmings. Next pile on about a foot layer of the chopped leaves and any other rakings or trimmings (even leftover naiad greens.) On this sprinkle a layer of bonemeal, dried blood, cottonseed meal or the like. Add a layer of soil. Repeat the sandwich until the layers are a manageable height4 to 5 feet. Keep well moistened. Cover the pile with burlap, more soil or hay to retain the heat. By spring, it should be well on the way to decomposition. Turn the pile every three months. (Over the winter months this is almost impossible.) So early next spring, give the pile a turn, keep it moist, and by planting time, compost will be ready for sifting out and use as nature's own soil improver.",1972-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Gradually her family's heirloomed junk in the basement begins appearing in every room of their sterile concrete-contemporary mansion. They draw the shades and lock the doors against the neighbors. Their happy complicity gives way to shared hostility. And the games increase in feverish intensity, until reality replaces fantasyand all too soon the terrible dare becomes tragic denouement.All too soon, but not soon enough for meat least in Carlos Saura's ""Honeycomb,"" the latest and the least of those movies that mean to unlock the secrets of middle-class matrimony by means of a willful indulgence in everyday unreality. Such films (Peter Medak's ""Negatives,"" Curtis Harrington's ""Games,"" etc.) seem invariably to follow a process of elegant dissolution  never inelegant dissolutionuntil all is laid bare in the destructive psychodrama of life. But in ""Honeycomb"" nothing is laid bare except the dullest of make-believe constructions covering for the lack of insight that would be necessary to sustain the most ordinary unhappy domestic drama.Mr. Saura, normally a director of forceful personality, whether you like him or not (""The Hunt,"" ""The Garden of Delights""), hardly exists except at the very beginning and end of the movie. And if there is any reason for ""Honeycomb,"" it is to display the talents of what is virtually two-person cast: Per Oscarsson as the husband and Geraldine Chaplin as his wife.Oscarsson (""Hunger,"" ""Here is Your Life,"" etc.) has no relation to his part and gives the impression of acting, reluctantly, through the discomfort of a persistent low-level headache. Miss Chaplin, looking now more than ever like the female image of her father, is better, but not good enough. The vacuities of the film, and of what I take to be her own screenplay, require not an interpretation but a kind of bravura improvisationand for this Miss Chaplin seems to lack the imagination, the self-fascination, the untrammeled bad taste.""Honeycomb"" opened yesterday at the Juliet I and Quad 3 theaters.",1972-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,They Only Kill Their Masters',"In ""They Only Kill Their Masters,"" a Doberman pinscher pulled from a corpse on a beach eventually cues in a small-town police chief to the killer. This is the most original and likable whodunit I have seen in years.There's no supercunning sleuth here, no splattering violence or sex and no self-conscious sociology. Instead, a bright, plucky policeman tools around a rather humdrum little community confronting some bright but cagey characters who seem as real as he does.The cast of the picture, headed by James Garner, and a casual opening suggest a made-for-TV movie  but hang on. Subtly, simply and soon enough you'll find yourself in the middle of an intriguing puzzle that is being performed with casual relish and wisely amusing dialogue. The tone, text and mystery have been set up and sustained with exquisite sensibility by Lane Slate's script and James Goldstone's direction.The treatment extends through the denouement, opening a nasty, sexual can of worms with telling restraint.Front and center is Garner in his most becoming performance, low-pedaling that blandness with just enough amusing bite. Katharine Ross is excellent as a smitten secretary; so are Peter Lawford as the victim's ex-husband and Hal Holbrook as a veterinarian. They're all good, in fact. And let's not forget a brief, unorthodox appearance by June Allyson, who does beautifully.The picture's last one-word line, spoken by Garner, best pegs it. See it.",1972-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Chekhov Plants Seeds for 'Belated Flowers',"A very young writer at the beginning of his career and an elderly film maker, nearing the end of his, reach a lovely, tactful kind of accord in ""Belated Flowers,"" based on the novella that Chekhov wrote in 1882, when he was 22, and now made into a film by Abram Room, who is 78.The novella, more evocatively titled ""Late-Blooming Flowers"" in the translation by I. C. Chertok and Jean Gardner, is a gently comic, bourgeois fairy tale about the redemptive love of the beautiful, consumptive and flatbroke Princess Marusya Priklonsky for the vain, hugely ambitious Dr. Toporkov, who'd once been a bootboy in the Priklonsky palace.The Priklonskys are at the end of their rope when the doctor comes back into their lives, though he scarcely remembers the name when he visits the palace to treat young Prince Yegorushka for delirium tremens. The old princess frets about the doctor's arrogance and wishes that he weren't so ill-born. He is, she knows, a catch. The young prince thinks the doctor is a bore and the young princess falls madly in love with him.Time passes. A disreputable old matchmaker comes by and suggests that the doctor would marry Marusya if she could produce a dowry of 60,000 rublesthe sum the doctor needs to acquire a fine new house. It's an unthinkable amount, and the doctor, instead, marries the daughter of a wealthy trademan.More time passes. The Priklonsky palace and possessions are lost to debtors. The old princess dies. The young prince acquires a rude, noisy mistress, and Marusya slips farther into a consumption that finally breeds its own kind of emotional antibodies. One day she goes to the doctor's office, pays her five-ruble fee and confesses to the amazed man that she loves him desperately.The doctor, whose entire life until then has been devoted to money, is transformed. Although it's too late to save Marusya, he takes her on an idyllic holiday to the South of France and, later, when last we see him, he is still making as much money as he can, but now he has taken the ridiculous, dissolute prince into his household, to feed and care for him and to indulge his whims. Writes Chekhov: ""Yegorushka's chin reminds [the doctor] of Marusya's chin, and because of this he allows Yegorushka to squander his five-ruble notes. . . .""Abram Room, who was a pupil of Kuleshov, is known in this country almost exclusively for his 1927 silent film, ""Bed and Sofa,"" and for ""The Garnet Bracelet,"" which was shown here in 1967 without creating any interest whatever. Compared with other great early Soviet directors, all of whom he has outlived, he is a most conservative director, yet the conservativism of ""Belated Flowers"" has the effect of being spectacular today.The film is conceived almost as if it were a theatrical piece. Sets never seem to have more than three sides, and it's a shock when the director occasionally turns his camera to show us the fourth wall. Most of the scenes are photographed in soft focus, in medium long-shots, through wide-angle lenses that have the effect of distorting perspective in such a way that we feel as if we're looking at a world enclosed in a glass sphere, as if it were in an antique paperweight. There's very little cutting so that even the slightest movement of the camera becomes somehow a momentous gesture, the visual equivalent of the emotions that rock the ill-fated princess.Not all of Room's decisions are happy. I could have done without the passages from Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, even though in the opening credits he makes the courtly acknowledgement that this music has helped him to interpret the story. The performances, however, are charming, as is the deference with which this venerable old director, handles an early work by a man whose youthful romanticism was disciplined by a humane irony that more mature writers seldom achieve.""Belated Flowers"" opened yesterday at the Regency Theater.",1972-11-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Unswerving Idealist,"For a quarter of a century, until his retirement ten years ago, R. L. Duffus was a member of the editorial board of The New York Times, an unswerving idealist, an independent and human observer, half Vermont granite, half gentle dreamer. He came out of the reporting and reforming tradition in journalism marked by two of his mentors, Ida M. Tarbell and the famous Fremont Older of The San Francisco Bulletin, where Bob Duffus got his first real newspaper job.His range of writings for The Times was astonishing. His articles and editorials covered the United States and the world. Nothing human was foreign to him; what ever he wrote had charm, erudition and, when necessary, bite. He believed that language could be a weapon to improve the human condition.We can think of no better way to note the death of this wellloved colleague than to let his voice be heard again in an editorial, Dunkerque, published on June 1, 1940, in one of the darkest hours of World War II.So long as the English tongue survives, the word Dunkerque will be spoken with reverence. For in that harbor, in such a hell as never blazed on earth before, at the end of a lost battle, the rags and blemishes that have hidden the soul of democracy fell away. There, beaten but unconquered, in shining splendor, she faced the enemy.They sent away the wounded first. Men died so that others could escape. It was not so simple a thing as courage, which the Nazis had in plenty. It was not so simple a thing as discipline, which can be hammered into men by a drill sergeant. It was not the result of careful planning, for there could have been little. It was the common man of the free countries, rising in his glory out of mill, office, factory, mine, farm and ship, applying to war the lessons he learned when he went down the shaft to bring out trapped comrades, when he hurled the lifeboat through the surf, when he endured pov erty and hard work for his children's sake.This shining thing in the souls of free men Hitler cannot command, or attain, or conquer. He has crushed it, where he could, from German hearts.It is the great tradition of democracy. It is the future. It is victory.",1972-11-30T05:00:00+0000
