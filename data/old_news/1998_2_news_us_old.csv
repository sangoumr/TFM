Alas, the censorship show was itself censored: before it began, officials decided not to hang one part of ''Unnecessary'' -- six photographs of a naked, aroused man wearing a gorilla mask -- calling the images ''problematic.'' As a result, Roxie Thomas and Trina Nicklas, who planned the exhibition, canceled it in protest.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Beckmann Archive,"Max Beckmann, one of the most provocative German painters of the 20th century, was rarely what he appeared to be. Part savvy insider with a flair for self-promotion, part political pariah, he was an extrovert prone to self-concealment and an avowed liberal who shunned political engagement. Beckmann (1884-1950) married into the German aristocracy and hobnobbed with high society, while taking potshots in his writings at the very people he courted to advance his career. ''The budding genius must learn above all else to respect money and power,'' he wrote with characteristic irony, adding that the riskiest thing an artist could have was ''too strong a backbone,'' which interfered with the requisite ''bowing and scraping.'' Similarly, Beckmann's relationship with other artists was never an easy fit. Allying himself with German realism, he maligned the abstract painters for making unformed, ''decorative'' work, yet he shared in many of their aims, including the desire for a new and transcendent art. Though driven into exile in Amsterdam in 1937, after the Nazis proclaimed his art degenerate, Beckmann, ever the opportunist, distanced himself from his fellow emigre artists to protect his position on the international art market. He even went so far as to describe himself as a nonpolitical ''hermit,'' a disingenuous assertion given the politically charged content of much of his work. Barbara Copeland Buenger, who teaches art history at the University of Wisconsin, has done an excellent job of editing and annotating Beckmann's voluminous private and public writings in MAX BECKMANN: Self-Portrait in Words. Collected Writings and Statements, 1903-1950 (University of Chicago, $34.95). The man who emerges from this revealing selection from his earliest diaries, war letters and public statements is duplicitous and more politically compromised than has been previously known -- yet also more interesting.

The skate has a hinged device on the toe and a detachable blade heel that allows for fuller contact with the ice and longer, more powerful strokes. When the heel snaps back into place, it makes a clapping sound. World records have been falling like snow on the World Cup circuit. The Americans, who had difficulty acquiring the skates last season, would have preferred that the clap skates be banned until after the Nagano Games.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Head in the Clouds,"Built from concrete quotidian events, the 11 tightly controlled stories in Richard Burgin's third collection, FEAR OF BLUE SKIES (Johns Hopkins University, $19.95), present characters of such variety that no generalizations about them can apply. Burgin is at home depicting bankers, writers, surfers, elevator operators and prostitutes alike. His motto might be ''Nothing is foreign to me,'' since his fiction seems to subscribe to a claim that is made by one of his narrators: ''You have to take people's feelings seriously or else you're a kind of emotional murderer.'' In the book's title story, the 22-year-old son of an aloof mother and an alcoholic father repeatedly dreams of floating weightlessly and transparently into the sky -- until a prostitute, who argues with him and steals his money, provides a ''durable memory'' with which to combat his sense of detachment. ''My Black Rachmaninoff'' deals with a divorced woman who mistakenly imagines that her building's handsome elevator man is the pianist she hears through her walls -- and who discovers, after she has managed to seduce him, new levels of self-delusion and shame. ''Bodysurfing'' tracks a banker's feelings of personal and professional failure, fueled by America's addiction to hype and money. The devastating conclusion, at once inexorable and surprising, is reminiscent though not derivative of Flannery O'Connor. Only the final story, ''My Sister's House,'' which concerns a lesbian whose brother learns she was sexually molested by their father, skirts predictability. Throughout this arresting volume, Burgin is sensitive to the infinite brands of human error (one story is actually called ''Mistakes'') as well as to our rare redemptive moments of resilience and understanding.

In the largest acquisition in high-tech history, Compaq, with its strength in small computers, agreed to buy Digital Equipment Corporation, which specializes in much bigger ones, for $9.8 billion. Digital no longer has the edge it had when it was the nation's second biggest computer maker. But it does have a sales force and network of technicians practiced in the ways of servicing big companies. So now that Compaq has chosen to take on I.B.M., selling a line of computers from the smallest laptops to the biggest mainframes, it may want to clone Big Blue's suave salesmanship as well.

It was based on his brief sideswipe into the lives of two desperate Hollywood hangers-on, and he entitled it ''Mizlansky/ Zilinsky or 'Schmucks.'

The charming farce weaves itself through the entanglement of a girl's school, headed by Margaret Rutherford, and a boy's academy (run by Alastair Sim, above), with an ironic eye on tradition and the separation of the sexes. The supporting cast, which includes Bernadette O'Farrell, John Bentley and Richard Wattis, and the two veteran stars fly high into the face of British academia under Frank Launder's experienced piloting. Joyce Grenfell is especially hilarious as an angular athletic director stalking the premises in a bloomer uniform and spouting academic bromides -- Friday at 4:35 P.M., Saturday at 11 A.M. on Bravo.

The writers, in their early 30's, both begin with epigraphs from John Wayne, and both quotations are utterly epistemological: about how we know what we think we know. ''When I started, I knew I was no actor and I went to work on this Wayne thing,'' Wayne says in Mr. Barden's book. ''It was as deliberate and studied a projection as you'll ever see.'' Wayne dismisses ambiguity as Mr. Lethem's book opens: ''Perversion and corruption masquerade as ambiguity. I don't trust ambiguity.'' The future of American studies, among other things, is right here, even if Mr. Barden and Mr. Lethem do not, like some of their contemporaries, do their work as ''young Americanists.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Negation's Child,"''No'' is the word that opens SHADOWS OF A CHILDHOOD (New Press, $23), Elisabeth Gille's autobiographical novel about two girls hidden in a Bordeaux convent during the Nazi occupation of France. The speaker is 5-year-old Lea Levy, who is struggling with three nuns who are trying to take away her lace-trimmed slip and expensive doll. Lea has been rescued from a roundup of Bordeaux Jews by the brother of one of the nuns, and she proves to be a difficult charge -- rebellious, rude, ungrateful, vowing that all the girls who bully and torment her will be punished as soon as her wealthy and glamorous parents return from their travels. Lea trusts only Benedicte, two years older, whose parents are with the Resistance, and who shields and looks after her. As Lea's recollection of her parents fades (''the more memories she lost, the more she invented''), the certainty of their fate grows plainer, first to the nuns, then with war's end to Lea herself. Benedicte's parents return to claim her, and they take in Lea as well; but Lea remains angry and withdrawn, obsessed with the unfolding news of the death camps and with the trials of those who collaborated in the deportation of France's Jews. Linda Coverdale's translation of this unsettling and uncompromising novel marks the first appearance in English of Gille, a French editor and novelist who died in 1996. Her theme in ''Shadows of a Childhood'' is refusal -- the refusal to forget or to cease struggling against indifference, denial, lies. Lea, ''precocious by nature and from necessity,'' is war's unyielding orphan, the one who never quits saying ''no.'' David Walton",1998-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,The Homosexual Exception,"If we listen to pundits and politicians, we get the impression that Americans are fighting a culture war. Some people are presumed to be moral traditionalists: they have an abiding faith in God, country and family and long for the days when morality was absolute and virtue predominant. Others, by contrast, are said to be modern, even post-modern, in their moral outlook: they accept a more secular America, welcome the fact that families are no longer patriarchal and think that our society has improved because one group can no longer impose its conception of the good life on any other. But in the course of in-depth interviews with 200 people in the suburbs of Tulsa, Atlanta, San Diego and Boston, I did not find Americans morally divided among themselves. I found them instead divided within themselves; most people want to be traditional and modern at the same time. They honor God, family and country, yet they also want to accommodate themselves to the realities of contemporary America. As a retired piano and organ teacher living in Broken Arrow, Okla., whose father was a Southern Baptist minister, put it: ''You don't have to accept anyone's dogma.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Boxes of Reality,"Photography was considered such a faithful record of reality that one of its inventors called it ''the pencil of nature''; 150 years later the true subject of photography appears to be the ultimate fake. In SMALL WONDER: Worlds in a Box (National Museum of American Art/D.A.P., paper, $35), a collection of color photographs of toy sets, David Levinthal plays with concepts of image and authenticity, myth and history, perception and reality. In an introduction, the critic David Corey calls the play sets of plastic figurines manufactured in the 1950's and 60's ''a museum of the material and spiritual preoccupations of the age.'' Levinthal often photographs these figures in crepuscular, slanting shadows, so that a scene of a bald-pated, bespectacled boss dictating to a stenographer takes on a Hopperesque loneliness and isolation. While Levinthal regards his subject matter with great seriousness, the implied commentary of his images on the history of photography is often hilarious: his image of cheese-yellow Lincoln and Grant figurines standing by a toy tent mimics the stiff poses of the real subjects in the images taken by Mathew Brady. By toying with our images of history, Levinthal questions how much we substitute image for actuality, from Edward S. Curtis's plates of American Indians to the battlefield photography of Robert Capa.

The last person to assemble an American retrospective during the artist's lifetime and to consult with him on such an exhibition was Katharine Kuh (1904-1994), who did so in 1952-53 when she was the curator of modern painting and sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago. An art historian, educator and critic who championed the new and vital, Kuh opened a gallery in Chicago in 1935 specializing in avant-garde European and American art; Leger was first shown there in April 1936. The gallery closed in 1942, and she joined the Art Institute a year later. After leaving the museum and moving to New York City in 1959, Kuh became art editor for Saturday Review and wrote several books. This essay is excerpted from ''Past Encounters, Present Memories,'' a book of reminiscences that Kuh was working on at her death; it was edited and completed by Avis Berman, her literary representative.",1998-02-08T05:00:00+0000

Michael Paxton's ''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life,'' opening today at the Quad, does little beyond appreciating its subject as unwaveringly as possible. Dutiful in outlook and utterly conventional in format, this film is an Academy Award contender despite its clear inferiority to such non-nominees as ''East Side Story'' and ''Sick,'' not to mention Errol Morris's visionary ''Fast, Cheap and Out of Control.'' Documentary filmmaking loses the respect it deserves when such a pedantic specimen is rewarded at the expense of truly imaginative work.",1998-02-13T05:00:00+0000

The Department of Medicine and the Cardiovascular Division of Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine mourn the death of Dr. Ira L. Rubin, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Medicine. Dr. Rubin served Montefiore for almost 60 years and was a member of the Einstein Faculty for over 30 years. His contributions to our institutions have been numerous and invaluable. Among the many important roles that he played was service as acting Medical Director of Montefiore's Morrisania City Hospital Service, Director of Montefiore's Medical Residency Program, and President of the Montefiore Medical Board. As a consummate cardiologist with a worldwide recognition, he authored numerous books and research articles on electrocardiography, and for over 35 years was Director of Electrocardiography at Montefiore. Dr. Rubin taught electrocardiography to countless numbers of cardiology fellows, medical residents and students. But above all, his kind and thoughtful manner, while practicing the very highest level of academic cardiology, made him a role model to young physicians and to peers, as he exemplified the very best personal and professional standards. A giant on our faculty has left us. He will be missed by all. Our deepest condolences to his wife, Bea. Dr. James Scheuer, Chairman Dr. Joan I. Casey, Vice Chairman Dr. J.

Astra's United States unit charged that Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the United States division of the French drug and chemical maker Rhone-Poulenc S.A., repeatedly failed to supply intravenous multi-vitamin products to Astra through Centeon, which is a joint venture between Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Hoechst A.G. The suit is the latest blow to Centeon, which makes blood plasma and other products at a plant in Illinois. In January 1997, the Food and Drug Administration forced Centeon to upgrade plants to meet safety standards, prompting the company to stop production for a number of weeks. Rhone-Poulenc said 1997 earnings in its drug division fell 7.9 percent, to 5.26 billion francs ($877 million), as ''a direct result of the Centeon situation.''",1998-02-14T05:00:00+0000

It's Them Again!,"When Emile Hazel, a high school teacher of Greek and Latin, retires at 65, he and his wife, Juliette, married for 43 years and in love since kindergarten, pursue their dream of shared solitude, moving to an idyllic house in the French countryside. But their tranquillity evaporates when their only neighbor, a doctor, begins a succession of seemingly interminable, increasingly uncomfortable afternoon visits. The intrusions enrage Emile and threaten the serenity of his marriage. Yet social convention keeps him from denying entry to ''our torturer.'' ''I hadn't realized that I was a coward,'' Emile muses. It is one of the less upsetting truths he will learn in Amelie Nothomb's slyly outrageous novel, THE STRANGER NEXT DOOR (Holt, $20). Curious as to who would marry such a man, the Hazels invite the doctor, Palamedes Bernardin, and his wife, Bernadette, to dinner. Bernadette is surrealistically repellent: ''a protuberance,'' a ''cyst'' who shakes hands with a ''tentacle,'' has a mouth ''like that of an octopus'' and speaks in unrecognizable sounds. Yet Juliette develops sympathy for this unfortunate creature, observing that the doctor, who appears to enjoy nothing, also seeks to deny any pleasure to his wife. ''You can't go on like this,'' Emile tells him. ''Look at your existence: it's not a life! You're a mass of suffering and boredom.'' As the end of the novel nears, Emile becomes convinced that murdering Palamedes would be an act of mercy. In Carol Volk's deft translation from the French, Nothomb develops this improbable plot in a highly entertaining fashion. ''The Stranger Next Door,'' the first of Nothomb's six novels to appear in English, both disturbs and amuses. Janet Kaye",1998-02-15T05:00:00+0000

In 1981, WWFM began serving Mercer County at 89.1 FM. Now the only all-classical station in New Jersey and the Philadelphia region, the WWFM Classical Network has an additional transmitter in Toms River (WWNJ 91.1 FM) plus a growing system of nine lower-power translators across New Jersey and in eastern Pennsylvania. Unlike many classical stations, which are commercial or members of National Public Radio, WWFM is both noncommercial and independent.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The First Photojournalists' War,"If the Vietnam conflict was this country's first ''television war,'' the Civil War was the first photojournalist's war. A corps of civilian photographers -- working with cumbersome equipment and dependent on natural light -- produced an astounding visual record. The most famous was, of course, Mathew Brady, but there were many others, most on the Union side, following troops into battle and capturing for all time the sad record of war. THE CIVIL WAR IN DEPTH: History in 3D (Chronicle, $24.95) collects examples of a form of photography popular at the time: the stereo camera, which produced two images of the same shot to yield a card viewed through a device called a stereoscope, creating the illusion of three-dimensionality. Bob Zeller writes that the images so created sold widely during and after the Civil War, until people began to tire of battles too painful or too removed to be of further interest. The book displays eternally American faces and American scenes familiar from history books; from Fort Sumter to Appomattox, from drummer boys to Grant and McClellan, the images seem to jump out at the viewer. Abraham Lincoln seems always to be on stage, from new President to a very tired one, photographed just 10 weeks before his fatal encounter with John Wilkes Booth. ''The Civil War in Depth'' is a more than worthwhile addition to the history bookshelf even if some assembly is required -- a folding stereoscope is included.David Murray",1998-02-15T05:00:00+0000

Pippin, who says the work is a personal tribute to the machines' ''unparalleled efficiency,'' began pursuing his vision years ago in a seedy London laundrette, which ejected him. After a long search for a new washeteria to serve as his base, he found a home in Bayonne. ''American laundromats attract odd characters,'' he says.

us,"Children's Books; It's Hard Work, Snowing","People have long attributed human qualities to natural phenomena. The ancient Greeks thought that gods controlled the sun, wind and sea. Native Americans believed that thunder and rain had a consciousness that could be appealed to directly. Even in our technology-dominated time, Ol' Man River keeps on rolling along, while Mother Earth spins dependably around the sun. One of the primary goals of childhood is to make sense of the world. Age-old stories and images can be comforting, but children can also work out magical explanations for themselves. In IS THAT YOU, WINTER? (Silver Whistle/ Harcourt Brace, $16; ages 3 to 8), the Caldecott medalist Stephen Gammell looks at the commonly anthropomorphized seasonal phenomenon, Old Man Winter, from two points of view. The story opens with Old Man Winter, a wonderfully grumpy-looking guy wearing an outsize ten-gallon hat, sitting in bed. It is time for him to be on the job and, like the average working stiff, he is not happy about it. He stomps outside, coffee mug in hand, and heads for his truck. Then the magic begins. The truck takes off for the sky, pulling a cold wind behind, dumping tons of snow on the ground below. Winter heads home for lunch, grumbling ''Who do I make it snow for?'' But as he is climbing the stairs, he slips and falls. The perspective changes. He lands in a snowdrift and a little girl rushes to rescue him. We now see that he is her doll. She clutches the tattered little manikin to her shoulder and whispers, ''You make it snow for me!'' In the final illustration, the two worlds blend. The girl runs off to play in the snow with her friends. Old Man Winter, the doll maker's stitching now clearly visible, waits and smiles, happy to have his hard work appreciated. In an ebullient tour de force Gammell uses pastels, watercolor and pencil to create a festival of color and image. His illustrations vibrate with the energy of gorgeous swirls, swooshes, splatters and flecks of rainbow colors. As for winter itself, is its prime mover a god, a force of nature or a grumpy old man with a long white mustache and an oversize hat? One little girl's guess is as good as any of ours.

That wasn't the only negative review The Examiner has given the new Mrs. Bronstein. Consider this passage in The Examiner's review of ''Diabolique'' in 1996: ''She seems to wear a different pair of sunglasses in every scene.

Less dramatic, but ubiquitous behind the scenes are the 15 curvaceous pictograms representing athletes in motion. The icons were designed for the games by Landor Associates International. While not as saccharine as the Snowlets, the games' official mascots, inset, the pictograms appear everywhere. Six abstracted ones make up the attenuated petals of the snow flower, official symbol of the winter games. More than 100 Landor designers in seven countries, including Japan, labored over the snow flower. ''When you're designing for the Olympics, you're creating an entity that has two weeks to live,'' said Kay Stout, chief marketing and creative strategist for Landor, best known as a shaper of corporate identity. Some may see the pictograms as contemporary hieroglyphics. Milton Glaser, the graphic designer, said: ''The world has gone logo crazy. Nine times out of 10, a word would be most understandable.'' Yo, is that a bobsled, or Shamu? A nouveau Rorschach test: Can you guess which sports the snow flower represents? Or identify the pictograms at right? We couldn't. (See below.)

Billed as the first over-the-phone public art installation, the call-ins aren't cheap -- $1.75 for the first minute, $1.25 each minute thereafter -- but Finley says she'll do her best to be provocative, intimate and spontaneous.

''Hey, it's Harry, Dick and Tom, havin' fun with Nancy's mom,'' they taunt her perpetually embarrassed daughter at the start of Norma Peterson's novel, RHONDA THE RUBBER WOMAN (Permanent Press, $24), which is set in small-town Pennsylvania in the 1940's. When Mom gets lonely, Eddie Jeffers (who's ''in the circus business'') takes up residence, and Nancy's desperately adaptive talent finally kicks in: she can bend all the way over and put her nose to the floor. With Eddie's encouragement, Nancy hits the stage of the Magic Midway carnival as Rhonda the Rubber Woman and discovers what it feels like to be her own -- distinctly acrobatic -- person. Norma Peterson died of leukemia in January 1997, and ''Rhonda the Rubber Woman'' is both her first and last novel. She seems to have had a vast array of incidents and emotions at her fingertips, as well as an eye for a woman's small comforts in wartime -- makeup, clothes, swing music, friendship. Apparently at ease with everyday incongruities, Peterson may have incorporated a few too many into her plot, but she also gave life to a resilient heroine who embellishes the contortions of fate with a few twists all her own.

The result showcases more than 500 illustrations, manuscripts, engravings, prints, movie stills and other artifacts stretching back to the 15th century. The accompanying text by the historian Alan Brinkley rolls through the high and low points of the nation's history, but it is the captions that sparkle the brightest, adding context while offering surprising information on such oddities as the 19th-century public fascination with phrenology (''the science of reading the human personality from the shape of the cranium''). The book contains classic documents like the first draft of the Declaration of Independence and the stark Depression-era photographs that emerged from the Farm Security Administration, but there are far less well-known entries that are equally fascinating, including Alexander Graham Bell's crude sketch of a telephone, a wanted poster for John Wilkes Booth and a spectacular array of illustrated maps showing the gradual broadening of the continent's terra cognita. The images with the most lasting impact focus on popular culture and everyday life: a couple of pages from an 18th-century primer used by New England settlers, for example, or a woodcut from an antislavery tract showing a slave owner's wife whipping a black girl, or a modest daguerreotype of a seamstress seated at an industrial sewing machine, whose set jaw and steely glance speak volumes about the pride and pain felt by female factory workers in the mid-1800's.

Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist, has had many grand passions during his three-decade crusade to cure schizophrenia, but none greater than his new human brain bank. For years, a major obstacle for scientists researching the neurological roots of serious mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, manic depression, depression -- has been the lack of first-rate human brains to study. ''The only schizophrenic brains available have been very old and not in very good shape,'' Torrey says. They came from state hospitals and nursing homes, from patients so elderly that by the time they died the brain had atrophied. ''We wanted to be in position to get better brains, brains of people younger and not dead long.''
