us,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"Identity  whatever that even means  has been having a moment, lately. The political climate forces us all to decide grimly what bunker will welcome us, and the new culture wars spur people to define themselves before somebody else does it for them to possibly violent effect. Identity may be abstract and elusive, but that doesnt mean it doesnt have real-world consequences. So our recommended titles this week turn a spotlight on the subject, from Francis Fukuyamas Identity to Kwame Anthony Appiahs The Lies That Bind to two books about identity politics on college campuses: The Splintering of the American Mind, by William Egginton, and The Coddling of the American Mind, by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt. (Those similar titles are no coincidence: Both books hark back to Allan Blooms classic The Closing of the American Mind.) We also have a book about the Spanish man who for decades falsely claimed to be a Holocaust survivor, and a joint biography of the mother and daughter who gave their names to the Myers-Briggs personality test. In other realms, theres a biography of the tennis legend Arthur Ashe; new fiction from Gary Shteyngart, Ben Marcus and Tsitsi Dangarembga; and an essay collection about the role of the dead girl in popular culture, which posits that  in that case, anyway  the absence of identity is the whole point.",2018-09-06T22:01:14+0000

us,5 New Designers to Watch This Season,"Growing up in upstate New York, Graham Tyler Baldwin was fascinated by art galleries. His parents organized family trips to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where the young art aficionado teared up the first time he saw a room full of pieces by Alexander Calder. Now 24, Baldwin will debut his first ready-to-wear collection during New York fashion week, inspired by his memories of these expeditions. Spring 2019 is from the perspective of myself as a child, dreaming after an art museum visit, Baldwin says. The collection seeks to replicate that childhood experience of first encountering the color field paintings of Brice Marden and Ellsworth Kelly. Baldwin originally studied sculpture at the Cleveland Institute of Art and landed an apprenticeship in 2013 with the milliner Marta Glazen. I became interested in headwear as a form of intimate sculpture on the body, he says. When he moved to New York City in 2015, he made custom headwear on his own for clients such as Lady Gaga, MAC and Barneys New York, and later for fashion brands such as Adam Selman and Polo Ralph Lauren. Making so many hats for so many labels, Baldwin wanted to finally create a brand under his vision. This coming collection, his first foray into ready-to-wear, will include a moir evening vest based on a small drawing by Ellsworth Kelly, a silk organza trench coat and, of course, beautiful headwear to top it all off.

It led to my next obsession: Pradas classic Linea Rossa collection of high-tech streamlined pieces made from sportswear nylon, which debuted in 1997 and soon became a hallmark of the brand. Now, Prada is relaunching the collection for a new generation of fans. Last February, Miuccia Prada closed her fall 2018 show with a series of nylon pullover jackets and bucket hats in an array of acidic neon hues, all bearing the Linea Rossa logo, a sleek red stripe. The new collection, which launches this weekend, retains the minimalist 90s sensibility of the original line but features an updated fabric. Anoraks, padded jackets, quilted pants and bucket hats (there are also angular wraparound sunglasses) all come in a more technical, waterproof and windproof nylon, in a rainbow of new colors including highlighter pink, safety orange and bright mint green.

The Old Testament tale of Exodus  the slaves flight from Egypt and their salvation in the desert  may be the most epic of all such sagas, and the Puritans aboard the Mayflower thought of their flight from King James as an exodus of the chosen people fleeing their pharaoh. Ben Franklins best-selling Autobiography mythologized his rags-to-riches rise from indentured servant to inventor and statesman, and in so doing he further stitched the redemption narrative into the nations moral fabric. Since then, activists, politicians and businessmen have all borrowed the story line to lend legitimacy to their ambitions, but few have done so more powerfully than civil rights leaders: Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that Christians who had succumbed to bigotry could repent only by righting racial wrongs; Malcolm X recounted his transformation from hustler and felon to militant activist and Muslim, and in so doing, he invited a nation of sinners to follow him down the same spiritual path. In America, the resurrected wretch (I once was lost but now am found) has more authority than the pious innocent  to have fallen and been redeemed is an act of self-invention and moral fortitude that mirrors the Pilgrims own impossible journey.",2018-09-10T09:00:01+0000

And a Maine-based company called Entosense sells online, too.

Located in the entry hall, the loom had been built of oak and chestnut by a local carpenter, and its squared edges had long ago gone smooth to the touch. Susanna, who is now 86, would sit before it, raising alternate strings attached to bamboo poles by pressing on the wooden pedals at her feet. She would send a bobbin of weft thread gliding across the horizontal surface of the remaining strings, strung taut in the looms belly, before yanking a heavy hinged wood batten with metal teeth toward herself, locking each new row into the others. This simple gesture  passing a weft thread through a base of stable warp threads  is the same for every piece of cloth ever woven. And on this loom, Susanna made everything the family needed, from bedcovers, blankets and towels to the wool textiles laid atop wood chests and the saddlebags slung over the backs of donkeys or men to transport things. Each piece was crafted according to designs and patterns stored in an unwritten repository of techniques and styles, many unique to the island, which over centuries had been passed through the hands of Sardinias women.",2018-09-13T14:15:56+0000

So the menu they devised features global touches in dishes like raw scallops with shiso tacos, sea urchin with a sweet-corn chawanmushi custard, shellfish pozole, and a tuna casserole with curry leaf. But Spain is not ignored either, with Txikito-style octopus carpaccio and skate with sherry, chili and parsley. The long, narrow space, formerly their Texo coffee bar, has been done in 1930s Modernist style. A central bar, lit by a complex hanging fixture by the local artist David Weeks, is its focus. I was inspired by the Maison de Verre in Paris, Ms. Raij said, referring to a landmark building on the Left Bank. I didnt want anything blue and nautical-looking.

Tomorrow, some 17 years later, Slimane will make another buzzy debut, unveiling his first collection for Celine as the French brands artistic, creative and image director, a role created specifically for him.

us,"Original, Handwritten Manuscripts of The Picture of Dorian Gray","He can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys, one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of The Picture of Dorian Gray in Lippincotts Magazine. This was just one of hundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out, Wildes grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wildes handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend, the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. Somehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time.  I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly. Such sentences led Lippincotts readers to deem this, in Hollands words, a disgusting, sodomitical novel. (He added that the full text would later be used in court as circumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual  a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new books foreword, considers this the urtext of Dorian Gray, revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. He was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased, Holland said of his grandfather. He had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.",2018-09-28T09:00:09+0000
