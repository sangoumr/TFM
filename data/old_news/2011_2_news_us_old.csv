Styles range from duffels and messengers to clutches and pouchettes  just the right complement to their edgy-yet-polished motorcycle-jacket-and-skinny-leather-pants aesthetic. The Syn, a spiraling half-clutch/half-shoulder bag made from Perch skin, blends Michaels past as a commercial fisherman (straps have fisherman knots and braids) and Nicoles penchant for utilitarian dressing.

By then they were great cult filmmakers, Mr. Deakins said, in a phone interview from his home in Santa Monica. I dont know why they had chosen to meet with me, but they did and we got on. Does he understand them any better now? I guess, he said, laughing.But Mr. Deakins professed as much surprise as the Coens have about True Grit being such a box office hit. Its maybe more accessible than most of their films, he said. I think its a great movie, but I think most of their films are great movies.He is currently working on Now, a futuristic thriller from the director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca), his first experience shooting in digital. What does he make of the divide between film and digital? I dont really see the point of the argument, Mr. Deakins said. You use images and light and texture and camera movement to tell a story.

The Waterbury Board of Education said in January that the schools production of the play, set in 1911 at a Pittsburgh boardinghouse where several freed slaves reside, could proceed, overruling an earlier decision by the superintendent, David L. Snead. Mr. Snead, who is black, had sought to cancel the play because the word nigger appears multiple times in its dialogue.

The friction had a 1990s familiarity: high versus low, alternative versus mainstream. But this is just a slick sleight of thought: if anything Robyn, a battle ram with uncanny songwriting gifts and only occasional moments of complexity, offers a more straightforward proposition than the quirky Ms. Perry.

Its 2010 album, A Thousand Suns, is strikingly different from the music that made Linkin Park a blockbuster band in the early 2000s, when it was a major instigator, or perpetrator, of rap-rock. At Madison Square Garden, Linkin Park was like two bands sharing a stage: the old hard-riffing rap-rock band and its newer, statelier, electronics-loving successor. ",2011-02-06T22:43:55+0000

The soft result extends Hollywoods losing streak to 13 down weekends in a row. Avatar, which was still raking in box office cash at this time last year, is only part of the explanation. A ho-hum batch of releases in recent weeks has also contributed to lackluster sales. For the weekend, a traditionally slow one because of the Super Bowl, The Roommate (above, with Minka Kelly, left, and Leighton Meester), a horror entry from Sony Pictures Entertainment, was No. 1 with an estimated $15.6 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. Sanctum, a 3-D horror film set in underwater caves, was second, selling about $9.2 million for Universal Pictures and Relativity Media. The romantic comedy No Strings Attached (Paramount Pictures) was third with about $8.4 million for a new total of $51.8 million.

According to Nielsens estimates, Foxs Glee attracted 26.8 million viewers, a record for this hit musical comedy and more than any other scripted series on television in three years. In comparison, however, ratings for the episode fell short of those for last years occupant of that highly desirable time slot, CBSs reality show Undercover Boss, which garnered 38.7 million viewers. Final audience figures for Glee and Foxs Super Bowl coverage were not immediately available on Monday; however, Nielsens preliminary overnight estimates from the major media markets were up about 3 percent from a year ago, when CBSs Super Bowl broadcast set a ratings record with 106.5 million viewers, the largest television audience in United States history. Opposite the ratings juggernaut on Fox, CBS fared the best with 3.9 million viewers for a rerun edition of 60 Minutes at 7, followed by reruns the rest of the night. ABC was third, averaging 2.7 million viewers for the 2007 movie Knocked Up, while NBC finished fourth.",2011-02-07T22:11:08+0000

Four officers are awaiting trial on misdemeanor charges of official repression in the case, but prosecutors had blocked release of the tape, arguing that it would taint a trial. An ABC television affiliate, KTRK, obtained a copy and broadcast it on Wednesday, reigniting anger over the arrest. On the video, the teenager appears to be clipped by a police car during a chase. He falls, flips onto his stomach and puts his hands behind his head. Several officers rush in, punching and kicking him as they arrest him. We are outraged at what occurred, Mr. Green said.

The project, which raised privacy concerns at the university, was called The 3rd I, and was organized by a new Qatari museum called Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art. According to the Chronicle, the device, which was installed by a body modification artist in a tattoo shop in Los Angeles, was originally mounted on three posts that were attached to a titanium plate implanted between Mr. Bilals skin and his skull. But Mr. Bilals body rejected one of the posts, despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, and he was in constant pain. So on Friday he had the post removed. While the wound heals, he is tying the camera to the back of his neck. Why didnt he do that in the first place? Its a performance, he told the Chronicle. With the performance comes endurance.

Tahrirs troubadour collective has specialized in the invention of slogans that are witty, abusive and aimed directly at the president, e.g., Mubarak, you rhinoceros (kharteet), / get out, get out, you pest (ghateet). Sometimes, perhaps to signal a certain gravitas, they dispense with rhyme and say it straight: The people want the fall of the regime. Along with the chanting, there has been much baladi music  a catchy, popular style, heavy on hooks and reverb  as well as poetry recitations and effigy hanging. This is Egypts folk culture: profane, bawdy, politically sophisticated. It stands as a direct challenge to the version of culture propagated by the Mubarak regime and its predecessors.

These photographs were also the result of a fortuitous collaboration between Mr. diCorcia and Dennis Freedman, the former art director of W, who gave the artist carte blanche to shoot fashion stories in places like Havana, Cairo and New York.

We started with a red lipstick, the definition of a grown-up woman, said Pecheux, noting that the designers fall 2011 collection seemed more adult to him than previous seasons. To twist it, we are adding a layer of metallic color. Lips were lined with M.A.C. Cherry Lip Pencil, filled in with a lipstick color being tested for fall tentatively called Runaway Red (according to M.A.C., Dare You is the closest shade currently available), dusted with M.A.C. Invisible Powder, and then dabbed with M.A.C. pigments in silver, rose gold and melon. Im not a fan of a lip with shimmer, a frosted lip  I think its cheesy, said Pecheux of his matte metallic creation. The look was paired with a hairstyle inspired by Tippi Hedrens character in The Birds, using Wella Ocean Spritz for texture and extensions with roots dyed into them. It gives the hairstyle depth, it makes hair look thicker, the minute you have a root it makes hair look thicker and a bit denser, the hairstylist Eugene Souleiman, who crafted the look, explained of the extensions.

Its not unheard of for Broadway producers to use focus groups, and the musical has used them before since preview performances began on Nov. 28.

They are then asked to fill out surveys and join in discussions in a V.I.P. room. The details of the focus groups were outlined in an e-mail to participants from OnTrack Research.

While I went to this years Stockholm Design Week, which ends on Sunday, excited solely about the latter, it turned out that the fair had something to offer in the former department as well. The Danish manufacturer Gubi recently shifted its attention towards resurrecting mid-century design icons, and the first fruits of that effort are on display this week. It has reissued Greta Grossmans 1947 Grasshopper lamp and the 1966 Stokke Chair by Jens Qvistgaard, and is now the sole owner of reproduction rights for the cult Hungarian designer Mathieu Mategots work, starting with a multicolored coat rack and two pieces in his signature perforated metal: the Nagasaki chair and the Dedal bookcase.

Among some of the finest gems are clips like the one above of Takarazuka, a 98-year-old Japanese song and dance troupe that specializes in performing adaptations of Western pop songs, classic musicals, operas, plays, novels or films as well as Japanese folk tales. (The clip above shows the musical number The Great Century, which incorporates the 80s soft rock anthem Final Countdown.) But in a bizarre twist on the idea of an all-male Shakespearean cast, the members of the ensemble are all women  making Takarazuka perhaps the only Vegas-style musical theater group in the world with professional drag kings on permanent payroll. But despite appearances, Takarazuka was never meant as an early-20th-century chorus line for Japanese womens liberation. To this day, cast members are put through a rigorous and patriarchally organized training program for several years before they are even allowed to set one foot on stage, with female (musumeyaku) and male (otokoyaku) actresses strictly separated in classrooms and dormitories. The inevitable lesbian overtones were largely ignored until the mid- to late 1930s, when Japanese officials were alarmed to a point that a ban on contact between the male cast members and their passionate female fans was imposed. To this day, most of Takarazukas over-2.5 million-strong annual audience consists of women, and so do the performers: an attempt in the 1940s to introduce male actors was successfully boycotted by Takarazukas own disgruntled cast.",2011-02-11T23:00:29+0000

In a joint statement with Mr. Muti and officials of the orchestra, two cardiologists at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Donald Lloyd-Jones and Bradley P. Knight, reported on Friday that Mr. Muti had fainted because of a common heart rhythm disturbance. Although their tests reveal that he retains excellent heart function, they added, he has had a pacemaker installed to monitor his heart rhythm and deliver a small electrical charge if the heart rate should fall too low. Patients with pacemakers live full and active lives with excellent prognosis, the doctors concluded. Mr. Muti remains in Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he is recovering from surgery for facial injuries incurred in the fall. He has canceled his remaining performances this winter, which were to run through Feb. 19. His next scheduled appearance with the orchestra is a concert performance of Verdis opera Otello on April 7, to be repeated twice in Chicago and, on April 15, in Carnegie Hall.",2011-02-12T00:02:33+0000

Yet somehow, Jackson never made it back to his N.B.A. roots, back to his favorite city, back to the corner of 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue. Jackson interviewed with the Knicks three times over the last three decades but the timing was never right. In 1987, the Knicks passed up Jackson, then coaching the Patroons, to hire Rick Pitino. Jackson joined the Chicago Bulls staff. Twelve years and six championships later, Jackson  a free agent after leaving the Bulls  spoke with the Garden president Dave Checketts. The exploratory talks went nowhere and Jackson instead joined the Los Angeles Lakers. Jackson was a free agent again in 2005 when Isiah Thomas asked him to coach the Knicks. Jackson declined because he got a better offer: a return to the Lakers. Now 65, Jackson intends to retire from the N.B.A. after this season, and this time for good. The opportunity for a prodigal return has seemingly passed. But at least one authority on Jackson can still envision him joining the Knicks some day.

The hair stylist Kevin Ryan agreed backstage, explaining that these men are not perfect, these are real men with flaws. To create a disheveled, slept-in feel, Ryan first liberally applied Bumble & Bumble Surf Spray and Sumo Tech to create a matte, dry texture, then used his own R Session Tool Root Control, a ceramic heated comb, ideal for taming frizz and flyaway strands. And since the overall goal was to make hair look rough and not too groomed, styles were finished with spritzes of TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Dry Conditioner. For mysterious, sultry eyes, the makeup artist James Kaliardos used M.A.C. Satin Taupe and Charcoal Brown eye shadows and M.A.C. Brush #213, which created a smoky eye without looking like sharp eyeliner. Kaliardos then pressed M.A.C.s Brit Wit Creme Blush into models lips and cheeks, and patted M.A.C. Line Filler all over the face to minimize pores and even out complexion. Forgoing foundation altogether, Kaliardos used concealer minimally, to veil the skin and not disguise individual imperfections.",2011-02-13T15:00:29+0000

She was filling in on sound byte duty for Paul Hanlon, the shows key hairstylist, who was busy presiding over the swarm of stylists  three per girl  busy scraping hair back from the face, dousing it in product (chief among them Frederic Fekkai Coiff Bouffant Lifting & Texturizing Spray Gel), clipping it into twists and coils, and setting with a blow-dryer. When the clips come out, theyre going to start to destroy [the shapes] by pulling out pieces to make it more 3-D, said Outen. When [the models] are in the line, Pauls going to do his magic. In between, the makeup artist Tom Pecheux painted on a glamorous take on the 90s Kate Moss cat-eye. I was like, what is a young designer like? Who does he want to dress? And which kind of woman wants to wear a cool young designer? A rock chick, said Pecheux. His take replaced that rock chick staple, black liquid liner, with M.A.C. Rich Purple Chromagraphic Pencil on the eyes waterline and M.A.C. Keep It Cool Eye Shadow (available fall 2011), used to a soft liner effect, brushed out to the brows. I went for silver on the inner corner of the eye, almost like a futuristic tear. And the crimson lip? Its a huge controversy!

The collection today is inspired by uniforms, so I did this school-girl uniform hairstyle, where the girl scrapes her hair back and puts a barrette in her hair, explained Pita. But were not doing the barrette, to keep it a bit more streamlined. The hair was straightened with a T3 iron, pulled into a clean half-ponytail and set with T3 Control Hairspray. Pecheux created a slate gray smoky eye using silver and black Estee Lauder shadows (available this fall), which he paired with a nude matte lipstick, brow pencil, and Este Lauder Bronze Goddess Soft Duo Bronzer. Derek Lams clothes are very feminine and very luxurious, but very graphic and minimal at the same time, said Pecheux, a sentiment that was echoed by the manicure Jin Soon Choi paired it with. Its a wintery white from Este Lauder called Porcelain  very clean, minimalistic, bright white, she said.

The gorillas resemblance to humans astonished many people, especially after Darwin published On the Origin of Species later that year. The politician Edwin M. Stanton was soon calling Abraham Lincoln the original gorilla and joking that Du Chaillu was a fool to have gone to Africa for what he could as easily have found in Springfield, Ill.But the more common way to deal with our resemblance to monkeys and apes then was to fob it off onto other ethnic groups  typically black people, or sometimes the Irish.

The downtown theater artist Jack Ferver and his QWAN (Quality Without a Name) Company will take a stab with Swan!!!, a parody of the 2010 movie that will be staged as a dramatic reading from March 10 to 12 at Performance Space 122 in the East Village. The show is a follow-up to Mr. Fervers Notes!!!, a like-minded treatment of the Judi Dench-Cate Blanchett film Notes on a Scandal that developed a cult following during performances downtown last spring and fall. According to production notes Swan!!! focuses on the ballerina Nina (Natalie Portmans role in the film, played here by Jenn Harris), who is freaking out because she is crazy. Also crazy is her mother, played by Randy Harrison of Showtimes Queer as Folk (and Barbara Hershey in the movie); her Swan Lake choreographer; and a former prima ballerina. Mr. Ferver will play the hot new bad ballet girl in town, Lily (Mila Kunis in the film), who becomes Ninas frenemy. Mr. Ferver said in an interview that he had not gone through legal hoops with the creators of Black Swan because he and his collaborators were appropriating the work into a camp spectacle, meaning that parody is protected under fair-use exceptions to copyright law. It is going to be insane, Mr. Ferver promised.

But before we get to that and the impending divorce proceedings, I have a bone to pick with the haphazard unfolding of the episode.

This is the best way the writers could think of for Albys getting back at Bill for getting Lura away from him? Even as the scene was transpiring it seemed as if the writers were doing it on a lark and were fully conscious that the plotting was arbitrary and almost jokey. (The jaunty music accompanying the attack made this especially clear.)Also: Bills mothers dementia isnt feeling fully integrated either. Her dementia may be relevant to the seasons theme of the Henricksons general deterioration, but beyond that symbolic value, its hard to see how Loiss condition will matter much to the final outcome of the show.

The makeup artist Diane Kendal used Nars Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl on eyelids and on top of it, and applied three blushes  Desire, Taj Mahal and Exhibit A, in that order from inner lid to outer lid to an ombre effect  which she blended out past the bleached eyebrows. We wanted to have that feeling of sun and hotness but then also exotic, Kendal explained.

The question that arises in Dions puzzle is: How can we optimally combine randomness and order? Its a fitting question for today because, no matter how orderly a plan you might have made for a perfect Valentines Day, randomness might just intervene.

Haute and Naughty Mascara only on outer lashes, M.A.C. Eye Gloss on lids and M.A.C. Blush in Angel on the cheeks. On the lips were using a new [M.A.C.] color called Prince Noir, and were applying it with a lip brush and then blotting it with tissue so it gives a really beautiful stained burgundy look, Kendal said. Nails were kept relatively short and painted with two coats of a shade from Creative Nail Design called Dark Ruby followed by a generous coat of Super Shiney Top Coat, to contrast the matte textures such as fur, velvet, suede, said CNDs Wanda Ruiz. The hairstylist Orlando Pita, who took the big, beautiful necklines into account when creating his polished, rolled bun-chignon hybrid using Moroccanoil products, clearly also had the Carolina Herrera client in mind.

For his fall collection, Reid said backstage, My focus was on construction, a lot of tailoring. I spent an inordinate amount of time perfecting each piece. My mens looks are cleaner, with more subtle details than before. In line with Reids penchant for individuality, the hairstylist Marcos Diaz created looks that were groomed but not Don Draper. Using just the newly launched Mat Forming Ground from Davines (a supermatte clay) and his fingers, Diaz formed a natural-looking side part and left the rest of the hair dry-looking and clean. Emphasizing approachability, Diaz said, Im interested in keeping hair more realistic, something you could easily create at home. The makeup artist Nadine Luke relied on a few key players from M.A.C. and her belief of a little goes a long way for mens makeup. Luke hydrated skin with Studio Moisture Fix, concealed as necessary, moisturized lips with Lip Conditioner, and tamed unruly brows with Brow Set (which she considers a guys secret weapon, as it instantly grooms both brows and mustaches). Luke finished the look with Mineralize Skinfinish, a shimmer-free bronzer that contours and provides a matte finish in a pinch, noting that Billy Reids guy is someone you wouldnt imagine grooming because hes slightly rugged. But really, hes a polished gentleman.Runway slide show",2011-02-14T21:05:22+0000

Or they might know him from his various photo shoots (signs Lagerfeld, of course) or public outings with his septuagenarian mentor, including a memorable St. Tropez trip in the summer of 2010, when Giabiconi and Lagerfeld stopped by a local newsstand, dressed to the nines and trailed by hordes of paparazzi and curious tourists. But being the male face for Chanel, Fendi and Karl Lagerfeld (as well as starring in a Coca-Cola Light campaign) is apparently not enough for the slightly cross-eyed little Corsican that could; in late 2010 Giabiconi also embarked on a singing career and released his first single, Showtime. Even though the song has been out for a few months and enjoyed considerable chart success in France, its gone largely unnoticed by the American public. Granted, under normal circumstances the epic video (above) accompanying the release of the heavily auto-tuned single would not be considered kitsch; its Wild West theme, with Giabiconi saving a bodacious brunette from her abusive boyfriend, complete with explosive super powers in the Californian desert, is pop video clich at its best. And Giabiconis English (Woz wrong wiz you, man?) is certainly better than Lady Gagas French. But the fact that it has Karl Lagerfelds blessing and the remote possibility of him doing a special cameo as a Bond-style villain makes it all the more enjoyable. That sadly doesnt happen, but then again, Giabiconi knows how to keep us on our toes: the video ends with a promising To be Continued.",2011-02-14T22:37:55+0000

The award, which is to be given annually, provides $50,000 to the writer and $100,000 toward the production costs for mounting the recipients play. Mr. Talbotts winning play, The Submission, described as an exploration of the importance of cultural authenticity in authorship, will be produced next season at MCC Theater, which is led by Robert LuPone, Bernard Telsey, and William Cantler. The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award is among the most generous in playwriting, and it is intended for emerging writers. Mr. Talbott, 46, has written only a few plays and, as a playwright, still lacks an agent. Mr. Laurents, the book writer for Gypsy and West Side Story and the Tony Award-winning director of the original La Cage aux Folles, created the award last year.

But an election year looms, as does the return of Gore Vidals The Best Man, the deliciously tart (when done well) play about politics, campaigns and the presidency. Jeffrey Richards and his fellow producers announced on Tuesday that they would revive that 1960 play in the spring of 2012 with hopes of catching election fever. Originally titled The Best Man, Mr. Vidals play involves a showdown at a presidential convention between two candidates, in essence an Adlai Stevenson character and a Richard Nixon type, brokered by an ill ex-president and complicated by secrets, machinations, and troubled marriages. Broadway had a revival of The Best Man not so long ago, during the campaign between George W. Bush and Al Gore and the subsequent legal battle in the fall of 2000. With political resonance and a cast led by Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, and Charles Durning, that production started off strong at the box office but had mixed reviews and declining ticket sales before closing in late December. (Mr. Gore had conceded two and a half weeks earlier.) That 2000 revival was the first Broadway producing credit for Mr. Richards, who has been a press agent since the 1970s and is now one of Broadways busiest producers. He is reuniting his producing team from 2000  Jerry Frankel, Michael B. Rothfeld, and Darren Bagert  to mount this production. The director will be Michael Wilson (The Orphans Home Cycle, Dividing the Estate). No cast members have been announced.",2011-02-15T21:00:36+0000

He refused to specify their locations, for security reasons, but he said that two had partially reopened. The precautions were taken after unusual occurrences were identified recently around a few missions abroad, the Israeli government said in a statement. The Israeli Counter-Terrorism Bureau had issued a travel advisory on Friday warning of a heightened threat against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad because of anniversaries this week of the deaths of two senior Hezbollah figures. It listed Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania and Venezuela as countries with a heightened risk. Imad Mugniyah, a Hezbollah commander, was killed by a bomb in Damascus in February 2008, and Hezbollah blamed Israel for his death. Sheik Abbas Musawi, a leader of Hezbollah, was killed by Israeli forces in February 1992. ",2011-02-16T03:59:31+0000

Soulemain said the edgier cast of models, which included Jamie Bochert (who had never walked for Rodriguez), inspired the look. Even though the clothes are incredibly expensive, not everythings pretty and so fitted, Soulemain explained. Its not a red-carpet feeling. Clearly, Rodriguez was convinced, seeing as he rang the manicurist Deborah Lippmann at 3 p.m. yesterday with some color direction. He said, I want a color thats not charcoal and not blue and not black, but strong  they wanted to have some strength and toughness, Lippmann said. (The gray she created will be named by Rodriguez and produced later this year.) The makeup artist Dick Page lined eyes with Shiseido cream shadows in Purple Dawn and Caviar, a black (available this fall). Im trying to leave the skin alone as much as possible. Since were at the beginning of the season, there are no big skin disasters yet, Page said, joking that his own disaster  a black eye he acquired last week  inspired the look. One skin care product even made it onto models faces: Shiseido Benefiance Full Correction Lip Treatment, which was smudged onto the lids just before the show to create a melty effect.

us,Stolen Egyptian Statue Is Found in Garbage," Zahi Hawass, the Egyptian antiquities minister, said on Wednesday that a statue of the pharaoh Akhenaten holding an offering table, left, one of the most valuable objects revealed earlier this week to have been stolen from the Egyptian Museum, had been found. In an interview, Mr. Hawass also defended himself against charges that he did not report the missing objects promptly. In the days after the museum was broken into on Jan. 28, Mr. Hawass claimed that, while 70 artifacts had been damaged, none had been stolen. Last Sunday he said that, in fact, 18 objects were missing from the museum. Two of the other objects, a heart scarab and a funerary statuette, as well as the goddess from a statue of a goddess carrying Tutankhamen, were found earlier this week. The Akhenaten statue was found in the garbage near Tahrir Square, Mr. Hawass said, by a boy whose uncle was a professor at the University of Cairo. His uncle called me today, and I sent some of the police and archaeologists, and they found it is the statue of Akhenaten, Mr. Hawass said. We are going to look inside all the garbage that they collected from Tahrir Square to find the rest of the objects.",2011-02-17T05:40:30+0000

Last season, he imagined shed fallen asleep on a bus, and created what was meant to look like a French twist that had been battered by a long day (and a long commute, one assumes). This season, shes grown her hair nearly to her elbows (Hanlon used 22-inch extensions) and pulled it into a low ponytail with some knotty nubs at the end. When [designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez] called me in London, the first thing they said to me was that they loved the idea of the girls having really long hair. The first test we did, the girls had this really long straight hair, very blunt, but it didnt feel like their woman  it was a bit army, said Hanlon, adding that the boys were inspired by a cross-country road trip theyd just been on. As an alternative, Hanlon referenced photographer Edward S. Curtis portraits of American Indian women, their hair parted in the middle, heavy behind their shoulders. He began a very low braid, which he then tied with a black elastic, leaving the last loop halfway pulled through. After the tips of the hair were razor cut, the entire head was sprayed with Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray (through a net, a favorite Hanlon technique) for some crunch. Its like when girls go out and they leave their ponytail tucked into their jackets, and when they take it off it looks kind of wrong. Im looking around at Dianes assistants, Hanlon said, referring to the makeup artist Diane Kendal, and some of them walked in with their hair like that. Its nice to have a wearable look.

One of its highlights is Steel and Shade: The Architecture of Donald Wexler, an exhibition at the Palm Springs Art Museum. Wexler, 85, has practiced in Palm Springs for almost six decades, developing an architecture that is acutely sensitive to the extremes of the desert climate. Wexlers all-steel Alexander houses, designed in 1962 with the structural engineer Bernard Perlin for the developers George and Robert Alexander, were sustainable before sustainability was trendy. Affordable, elegant and quick to assemble on site, thanks to a prefabricated structural system, Wexlers houses (their framing, roofs and exterior siding are steel, with drywall interior siding) were the perfect answer to the postwar housing boom. Steel, concrete and glass are ideal materials for the desert, Wexler says. They are inorganic and dont deteriorate in the extreme temperatures of the desert. And since these structures are relatively maintenance-free, the seven Alexander houses in a north Palm Springs enclave are as pristine today as they were almost 50 years ago.",2011-02-17T17:29:13+0000

To wit, de Mey created an exaggerated version of the kind of black eye makeup he said Scott herself always wears, which included heaps of Lancome Hypnose Mascara (in black, of course) and black eye shadow layered over pencil for a gothic look. Theres no highlight, no skin showing through, he said. The hairstylist Serge Normant also was inspired by the designer: The way LWren wears things, it doesnt look overly done. The girls arent supposed to look like her, but I wanted that easiness. Hair was brushed into a deep side part with volume added through the crown of the head for a just woke up look, which Normant set with products from his new namesake product line. The manicurist Yuna Park filled out the look with one coat of a gold-flecked black nail polish from Lancome called Noir 29, available this fall. You know you love it. XOXO.",2011-02-17T21:46:26+0000

Kyodo News, a Japanese news agency, had reported that the companies intended to farm sea cucumbers, a delicacy among Chinese, on one of four islands near the northeast coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Russia has reportedly invited enterprises from other countries to invest in businesses there, but so far there has been no third-party investment. The issue regarding the four northern islands is a bilateral issue between Russia and Japan, and we hope the two sides will properly handle the issue through talks, said Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to official Chinese news reports.

But Trinity was a troubled institution, and the trustees werent looking for another tweedy scholar. Enrollment was down even as the liberal-arts school was accepting 65 percent of all applicants  a striking contrast to its rivals Amherst and Williams, which typically admit fewer than 20 percent of their applicant pools. The biggest problem was Trinitys immediate surroundings, the crime-ridden, blighted neighborhood of Frog Hollow in Hartford. So Dobelle started an ambitious $225 million public-private urban-renewal project to improve the area  including the construction of three schools and a performing-arts center  without pushing its residents out.

With hand-hewn stone walls, an antique wood palace gate and a long reflecting pool leading to a soaring dining room, Junoon, on 24th Street west of Fifth Avenue, offers high-toned food that spans Indias many regions and cooking techniques, formal service and an extensive wine list  with prices to match.

But who had the biggest lift depends on how you look at the numbers. Mr. Bieber, who did not win any awards but who had a prominent performing slot at the ceremony, dominates this weeks Billboard album chart. Never Say Never: The Remixes (Island), the soundtrack to his new 3-D concert film, opened at No. 1 with 161,000 copies sold. But just as impressive, he has three other albums in the Top 40: My World 2.0 is No. 8, My Worlds Acoustic is No. 18, and My World, the mini-album that was his debut, is No. 31. Billboard said Mr. Bieber was the first artist to pull off that feat since Garth Brooks in 1993. The British alt-folk band Mumford & Sons and Lady Antebellum, the country-pop trio that went home with the most Grammy awards (five, including record and song of the year), also had good runs on the album chart. Mumford & Sons Sigh No More (Glassnote) holds at No. 2 this week. Its rise to No. 2 from No. 11 last week was largely based on impulse buys made during the Grammys telecast, on which the group performed with Bob Dylan, with 133,000 sales, a 169 percent increase from the week before. Lady Antebellums Need You Now (Capitol Nashville) is No. 4, with 85,000 sales, a 205 percent gain. (No. 3 this week goes to Vol. 37 of the series Now Thats What I Call Music!, which sold 95,000.) In terms of digital downloads, however, Lady Gaga and Cee Lo Green came out way ahead. Born This Way, which Lady Gaga performed at the awards, sold 509,000 copies in its first full week on sale, bringing its total sales in the United States  in just 10 days  to 957,000.

Total box office receipts for all films released around the world climbed to $31.8 billion, an 8 percent increase over 2009. But overseas ticket sales contributed all of the increase, as sales in North America were flat for a second year, at $10.6 billion, despite a boom in sales of higher-priced 3-D tickets. The Chinese box office market is just going gangbusters, said Bob Pisano, president and interim chief executive of the movie association. The association does not report overseas attendance figures; admissions in North America fell 5 percent, to 1.34 billion. In a development that Mr. Pisano called not so encouraging the number of North American admissions per capita fell to 4.1, the lowest level since 1993, from 4.3 in 2009.

Press representatives for the revival said on Thursday that Mr. Jones will play Arthur Hockstader, a Truman-esque chief executive deciding between endorsing the potential presidential nominees William Russell and Joe Cantwell. When The Best Man was first presented on Broadway in 1960 (and made into a film in 1964), Russell was perceived as an analogue for Adlai Stevenson and Cantwell as an amalgam of John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon; a 2000 Broadway revival, starring Charles Durning as Hockstader, Spalding Gray as Russell and Chris Noth as Cantwell, seemed to have its eye on the real-life contest between Al Gore and George W.

State Representative Scott Raecker introduced the bill this month as a way to create an endowment to pay for as many as 1,000 full student scholarships a year, but the proposal drew widespread criticism. David Miles, the president of the Board of Regents, State of Iowa, described the bill as a profoundly bad idea, one that was examined by the board in 2008 and determined to be not in the best interests of the University of Iowa or the state. Mr. Raecker told the student newspaper The Daily Iowan that he still believed the painting should be sold but said that the issue had become so polarized that reaching consensus is unlikely.

Under the yellowish dusk-to-dawn lights, I could see my boyfriends blond sideburns, denim jacket and dingo boots, and I could see him punch the boy in the stomach until he crumpled to the ground, then kick him over and over until his nose and lips were split and bleeding. In Townie, which details Dubuss 1970s coming-of-age in the poor mill towns of Massachusetts, there are none of the usual signifiers of todays 70s Nostalgia Industrial Complex, no peace-sign key chains or smiley-face T-shirts, none of the goofy stoners and ditsy girls in tube tops that American television viewers have become accustomed to on That 70s Show. Instead, Dubus writes about the apartments where his older sister buys drugs, two rows of three-story buildings surrounded by packed dirt worn smooth, a Dumpster in back always filled with dirty diapers, used condoms and pizza boxes. He writes about an early manifestation of Fight Club culture at his school, where, whenever there is a fight, boys and girls rush to one spot like they were being pulled there by the air itself. . . .

During a drunken revel characteristic of the rough Macedonian court, an Athenian woman named Thais, the mistress of one of the high officers present, made a startling suggestion. It would be a fine thing, she said, if with her own hands and with Alexander looking on, she set fire to the palace built by King Xerxes, who a century and a half earlier had reduced her home city to ashes, that it might be recorded to posterity that the women who followed Alexander had taken a severer revenge on the Persians for the sufferings and affronts of Greece, than all the famed commanders had been able to do by sea or land.",2011-02-25T17:35:18+0000

Anderson comes around to Waters, of course, when a team of celestial Simon Cowells repackages her to show that the old lady still has loads of talent, vigor and carnality in reserve. Nearly 70 years later, American culture has grown so absorbed with beauty and youthfulness that the films vindication of ability over appearance, depth and experience over novelty and thrills, seems even more wishfully fantastical than it was in 1943.

At least eight of the movies were worthy of best picture in one way or another, and there were enough twists and turns to keep the show interesting. Cant say the same about the hosts, who were really a host, namely Anne Hathaway. She gamely soldiered along while James Franco did, um, what exactly? Mr. Franco tweeted about doing the Oscars, made movies about doing the Oscars, gave many interviews about being a host, but when it came time to do the actual Oscars, he entered the witness protection program. Perhaps we should draw some satisfaction from the fact that this time around, it was the man who had the job of standing there and looking pretty.

The Auto-Tune the News segment was a bit of a head-scratcher. And the use of the fifth-grade choir from Staten Islands P.S. 22, a YouTube sensation known for its renditions of pop and indie songs, was denuded by singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow as the credits rolled.
