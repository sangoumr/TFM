His analysis is not as original or startling as he sometimes claims; his explanations of Bushs behavior are often highly speculative; and he relies too much on such overworked clichs as the parallels between the president and Shakespeares Henry V. But The Bush Tragedy is, nevertheless, an intelligent and illuminating book.

But barely a year later, she floundered badly at the 2007 long-course championships, making the finals in only one event.

I remember standing behind the starting blocks at the pool and thinking, I dont want to be here,  she says. I felt terrible, mentally and physically.

us,The Plot Against Britain,"Henry James wrote that the novelists task, in an imperfect and disappointing world, is to create the record, in default of any better enjoyment of it; to imagine, in a word, the honorable, the producible case. Perhaps the most overt way of creating the record in fiction is to rewrite history entirely, to place credible characters in a hypothetical world. What if the South had won the Civil War? What if India and Pakistan had remained one country after 1949? What if Muslims had conquered Europe during the Crusades? These are enticing conceits, on the surface, but rarely successful in practice. Perhaps the most notable recent example is Philip Roths 2004 novel The Plot Against America, which imagines an anti-Semitic regime taking power in the United States during World War II. In an essay that appeared in the Book Review when Plot was published, Roth admitted he had no literary models for reimagining the historical past. ",2008-03-02T05:00:00+0000

It was quite an occasion last October, then, when Patrick and Reilly announced they were swapping logos. Patrick left ESPN, his home of 18 years, and become a contributor to Sports Illustrated; Reilly, a 22-year vet of S.I., transferred to ESPN. It wasnt a trade! Reilly clarified recently.

As Federer, 26, has said of Sampras: You can wake him up at 2 in the morning and hell hit a monster serve. Rare, if not unprecedented, is the opportunity to watch champions from different eras  perhaps the two greatest of all time  take a whack at each other.

Neither was she adopted by wolves who protected her from the Nazis, nor did she trek 1,900 miles across Europe in search of her deported parents or kill a German soldier in self-defense. She wasnt even Jewish, The Associated Press reported. Misha Defonseca, 71, right, a Belgian writer living in Dudley, Mass., about 60 miles southwest of Boston, admitted through her lawyers last week that her book, Misha: A Mmoire of the Holocaust Years, translated into 18 language and adapted for the French feature film Surviving With Wolves, was a fantasy. In a statement to The Associated Press, Ms. Defonseca said: The story is mine. It is not actually reality, but my reality, my way of surviving. I ask forgiveness to all who felt betrayed. I beg you to put yourself in my place, of a 4-year-old girl who was very lost. Ms. Defonseca, who gave her real name as Monique De Wael, said her parents were arrested and killed by Nazis for Belgian resistance activities when she was 4; she was cared for by her grandfather and uncle.

In one episode of the series, The F.B.I. at 100, a former F.B.I. agent, Mark Young, said that Angels became enraged in the aftermath of the Rolling Stones free concert at Altamont. During the concert a fan was stabbed and killed by the Angels, who had been providing security for the Stones. The Stones then distanced themselves from the Angels, which made the Angels angry with Mr. Jagger, the program said. They were going to kill him in retribution for his firing their security forces, Mr. Young said in the program, the BBC reported on its Web site.

us,A Ferrys Rebirth on Governors Island,"The Islander at its Governors Island berth. (Photos by David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) Slide Show: A Tour of the IslanderFinished With Engine, reads the white dial of the brass engine telegraph in the wheelhouse of the double-ended M/V Islander ferry.   Finished, indeed.   After 57 years of service on the seven-mile route between Woods Hole, Mass., and Vineyard Haven on Marthas Vineyard, the Islander is now berthed at Governors Island, where it is to begin a second life in 2009, serving the four-tenths-of-a-mile route between the island and the Battery Maritime Building in Manhattan.   But though its long days under the ensign of the Woods Hole, Marthas Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority ended exactly one year ago, on March 5, 2007, the Islander looks in many respects as if the crew had just stepped off a few minutes ago.   Navigational charts showing approaches to Woods Hole and Vineyard Haven are still affixed firmly in the boat's wheelhouse. A box of triangular pencils (they cant roll away in a rolling sea) lies open. A roster showing crew changes hangs from a clipboard. So does this stern notice from the port captain:   It is the responsibility of Steamship Authority employees to make certain that passengers and visitors on the Islander during its final trips do not remove any items from the vessel as ""souvenirs."" Deck watch crew are to be especially aware of possible theft, and are to report any items noted as missing to the captain. Personnel on the freight decks should be aware of items ""liberated"" from the vessel being placed in vehicles.  The policy did and didnt work. Ghost outlines of plaques in the cafe attest to some successful liberation. But much remains, ranging from the beautiful (the engine telegraph manufactured by Chas. J. Henschel & Company Inc., Amesbury, Mass.) to the mundane (stacks of timetables, piles of Marthas Vineyard Best Read Guide and more orange life jackets than can be counted).   A copy of Yachting magazine  appropriately enough  can be seen discarded near a crew members bunk. A drawer in the pursers office yields the lost-and-found log, a potentially rich lode of sociological information. (Lots of cellphones go missing at sea, it seems.) The last recorded object left behind on the Islander was a pair of wired frame reading glasses, found at 1630 hours, Feb. 27, 2007, on the Woods Hole-to-Vineyard Haven leg.   Leslie Koch, the president of the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, which paid $500,000 for the Islander, sees it as the latest milestone in a long maritime tradition stretching back to Henry Hudsons 1609 voyage and Robert Fultons steamboat nearly two centuries later. From the Half Moon to the Clermont to the Islander, she said.   The reason we acquired the boat was for redundancy and also to increase capacity, Ms. Koch said.  There is no charge for the hourly ferry service to the island, which the public may visit during summer months. (It reopens May 31.) The south end is being prepared for redevelopment and parkland.    The ship formerly served on the seven-mile route between Woods Hole, Mass., and Vineyard Haven on Marthas Vineyard.  Slide Show: A Tour of the Islander The corporation controls all but the 22-acre historical north end of the island, which is administered by the National Park Service, and currently operates the 53-year-old Lt. Samuel S. Coursen ferry. It has a capacity of 493 passengers and 30 vehicles in four lanes on an open-ended deck. The Islander, designed by Eads Johnson of New York and christened in 1950, currently has a capacity of 770 passengers and 47 vehicles in six lanes on a closed deck. The two outside vehicle lanes may be converted to passenger use.   Rehabilitation will almost certainly include removal of the enormous double doors at either end of the Islanders car deck, which helped seal the vessel for what could be very rough weather. This is basically an oceangoing ship, said Jon Meyers, director of real estate. We much prefer the open visual access of the Coursen. It takes as long to open the doors as it does to run our ferry route.   Two years ago, as Massachusetts prepared to say farewell to the Islander, the chief engineer, Steve Broderick, said: This thing is a fighter. Its got tenacity, but nobody in their right mind runs a 56-year-old boat.   The Islanders architect, Mr. Johnson, might have disagreed. Age means little where intelligent maintenance prevails, he said in 1947, when 71 ferryboats served New York Harbor, one of which had passed the half-century mark.   No matter what changes may be made to the hull and its fittings, Ms. Koch promised that the Islander would stay the Islander.   We are keeping the name,"" she said. And we promise a free ride to everyone from Marthas Vineyard. ",2008-03-05T16:20:50+0000

One of the more startling year-to-year changes was a sharp rise in spending by the studios specialty divisions, which make and distribute some films intended for the annual awards races and others aimed at getting fans of horror and other genres.

(Photo: Jean-Luce Hur for The New York Times) )   Before the Paris collections ended, I stopped by Azzedine Alaias place to see what he was preparing for fall. I found him upstairs in the studio, which consists of many racks of samples and dress patterns, stacks of shoe boxes, ironing boards and, at the far end, near a huge mirror, his ample work table. Alaia offered me a chair next to the table. A number of writers had trooped by over the weekend and we probably all had the same thought: Gee, what a fantastic way to look at clothes.   Alaia had made a runway out of a path between some dress racks. The first thing he showed me was a violet-gray wool coat that was snug through the waist and then opened to a skirt of tubular-like pleats. Each pleat was formed by an arch of stitches at the top. Its intriguing that a number of designers have shown rounded shapesAlexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs (the ribbing and necklines at Vuitton), the fellows at 6267, with their fluted leather collars. Alaias coat suggested to me Moorish architecture. A knit jacket in pinkish beige wool had a high rolled collar and dolman sleeves; the flaring skirt was ribbed and ruched in places. The outfit was all a knit, as were sleeveless tops and matching skirts that combined sheerness and curly bands of wool.   What Alaia is able to do with knitting is remarkable. He produces ruffles and poodle curls that look like lace. The skirt of one outfit, in a boiled black knit, consisted of vertical rows of overlapping circles, like sugar cookies arranged on a buffet tray. And all of these effects are a technical extension of recent work, like the pleated caterpillar dresses worn at last years Costume Institute party by Stephanie Seymour and Naomi Campbell, and the new crinkled cotton shirt dresses for spring that use embroidery anglaise.

Cavallier, plucked it from the crowd and cast it in starring roles in several of the biggest commercial successes the perfume industry has ever seen. It virtually defined perfume style in the 1990s.

The station, around the corner from where Peterson was born and reared, already memorializes Lionel-Adolphe Groulx (1878-1967), a Canadian priest, historian and powerful influence on the Quebec nationalist movement who was also known for anti-Semitism. Oscar Peterson is important as a symbol of success over adversity, said Michael Citrome, a Montreal graduate student in law whose campaign on Facebook on behalf of Peterson, who died in December, has attracted 5,000 members. Lionel Groulx has a message that immediately divided Quebeckers. Hes the symbol of an era that we need to put behind us. Mr. Citromes supporters point out that renaming the station would honor Peterson and give overdue recognition to Montreals black community. None of the citys 68 Mtro stations is named for a member of a minority. City Hall says a committee will study the matter.

It was the 2004 Eastern Conference semifinals, not the 2005 Eastern Conference finals. And the article referred incorrectly to the parquet floor used for Celtics games at TD Banknorth Garden. The team moved the floor to the Fleet Center from the Boston Garden, the teams former arena, in 1995.

Levi Strauss introduced denim Koveralls for children in 1912; Lee followed the next year with its Union-All suit, intended for farmers and factory workers. World War I pilots wore flight suits based on Lees adaptable model, and avant-garde artists zipped up after the war: the Constructivist artist Alexander Rodchenko had a two-piece productivist outfit designed to look like a jumpsuit. In the 1940s, cartoonists added fantasy to the onesie, outfitting the Flash and Green Lantern. But it took man walking on the moon to usher in the golden age of the jumpsuit  the 1970s. Soon, entertainers kicked it up a notch: David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust wore outrageous versions; Evel Knievel was sometimes carried into the emergency room in a star-studded red, white and blue leather number. Devo performed in yellow jumpsuits. And in the early 1980s, retro-futurist designers like Thierry Mugler introduced styles with padded shoulders.

While they definitely have the looks to make the fashion scene out there, Giuseppe Valentini, Nikolas Apostolopoulos and Daniel Murphy (above) have little interest in hanging out with Lindsay or Paris. In fact, they are as inclined to trawl the farmers markets as the bars, so they can serve up elaborate Greek dinners and anecdotes about their grandmothers in the three-bedroom duplex they share. The trios quaint sensibilities translate into pinstriped blazers, short-sleeved cashmere cardigans and narrow-collared shirts with buttons made of corozo nut. Rather than staging a runway show to showcase their line, the guys made a short film, which has the look of a Super 8 home movie taken at a sunny backyard barbecue  albeit one where all the guests are impeccably dressed bright young things. Rather than just show the clothes, we wanted to evoke an emotion, Murphy says. That emotion is suffused with hazy nostalgia, much like the collections creators.

Since 9/11, American readers have shown an appetite for simple tales told with becoming directness. While that approach may never characterize our most self-important fiction, it has been reflected in a number of artful works of popular literature in the last few years. I am thinking of Khaled Hosseinis tale of Afghanistan, The Kite Runner, and Alice Sebolds Lovely Bones, about a murdered little girl in heaven who still longs for life. Less venerated by critics, but very much on point, are Mitch Alboms wildly popular short novels  The Five People You Meet in Heaven and For One More Day  which, at a minimum, deserve the respect due any works that so resonantly reflect the tenor of their times. In the wake of 9/11, Americans seem to crave the reassurance of straightforward tales about good people trying to live good lives, who believe in love and friendship, work and honor and charity, the prosaic but immense forces that dignify most of our lives.

Needless to say, that doesnt include his sideline as a fashion icon. Did you know that Hammer pants are back? Labels like Dior (left) and Burberry have been doing really baggy trousers. Yes. To have invented the Hammer pants and have them re-emerge with a twist is an honor. When and how did you start wearing them? In the late 70s, during the disco era, when we were going out to the clubs. The looser the pants, the more accentuated your dancing becomes. Initially I would buy triple-pleated zoot-suit trousers from the 40s; when I became MC Hammer, I started having my own versions made. Did you wear Hammer pants later on, when you were a pastor officiating at the weddings of people like Corey Feldman and Mtley Cres Vince Neil? I use Hammer pants to perform. For day-to-day life, I have 30 suits that I rotate. Ive always been a high-fashion dresser and love the bespoke style. Once, I bought 80 suits from Versace in all the colors of the rainbow  as bright as canary yellow. To accessorize I had special-edition Versace watches and Rolexes customized with rubies and baguettes. And then came the earrings. Have you ever considered fashion design? Part of my vision is to have a clothing line with a great strategic partner. Not just upper-end, but scaled back to a great pair of Hammer-style jeans  baggy, but not the baggy kind that kids are wearing falling off the butt. I mean baggy Hammer in the crotch area  big difference. Maybe you should call some of the designers that are doing Hammer pants now and ask to be in their ad campaigns. I think you should suggest it, and Id certainly be interested. [?][?][?]ARMAND LIMNANDE",2008-03-09T05:00:00+0000

The newspaper said Chinese print and electronic news media were told on Friday to immediately remove any works and commercials featuring Ms. Tang, but it was not clear how long the ban would continue.

In December, her performance won her honors as best new performer in Taiwans Golden Horse Awards, considered the Chinese-language Oscars.

Situated among the oil wells, wheat fields and cow pastures of Alberta, the community is already home to a three-day annual Star Trek convention. Dayna Dickens, a spokeswoman for Vulcan, said: Because the films story line is based on a young Mr. Spock and a young Captain Kirk in their early days at Starfleet and because we think of Mr. Spock as our native son, it would be a neat tie-in to bring Spock home for the movie launch. I mean, Vulcan is his birthplace. Actually, a surveyor named the railroad stop in 1910 for Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.

us,Scholarly Feminist Brought to Light,"Curators at Britains National Portrait Gallery, researching an exhibition that is to open on Thursday, rediscovered a painting of an 18th-century female scholar who was a member of the Bluestocking group of intellectuals who promoted the advancement of women, the BBC reported. The oil portrait, above, regarded as a major work, was created between 1735 and 1741 by John Fayram and depicts Elizabeth Carter as Minerva, goddess of wisdom and warfare. Carter was known for her translation of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, but her friend Samuel Johnson said that besides her talent for translation, she could also make a pudding, work a handkerchief and compose a poem. The curators knew of the existence of the painting from a poem published in 1741 and a photograph sent to the gallery in the 1940s and found it in a private collection. Never previously on public display, it will be seen in Brilliant Women: 18th-Century Bluestockings, running until June 15.",2008-03-10T04:00:00+0000

He grew up in Rome, but works mainly in Naples (where, last year, he took me to the amazing La Tavernetta) and his cooking reflects that.   This dinner focused on pasta with seafood, in a red sauce.

The author reportedly penetrated the Irish Republican Army and organized gangs and recruited agents to infiltrate jihadist groups plotting terror attacks in Britain. Legal proceedings, to be held in secret, are expected to begin at the High Court in London this week before a senior judge, who will rule on whether publication would breach national security. The controversy is reminiscent of the Spycatcher scandal of 1987, when the government unsuccessfully tried to prevent Peter Wright, another former MI5 officer, from publishing details of his work to uncover a traitor within the security service.

Eliot Spitzer was a client of a high-end prostitution ring broken up last week by federal authorities has attracted international attention, threatening to end his career and throwing the political world of New York State into chaos. The New York Times, which broke the story on its Web site on Monday afternoon, has three front-page articles explaining the situation.In a main overview, Danny Hakim and William K. Rashbaum review the details of the federal investigation, Mr. Spitzers terse apology and the shock in Albany.

Michael Powell and Mike McIntire explore the dizzying rise and fall of Mr. Spitzers career, an arc that includes a sterling educational pedigree and eight years as a crusading state attorney general.

us,"Rome, Part Two: True Roman Food","(Photo: Pizza from a bakery in Campo di Fiori.) I'll get to the point here in a minute, but indulge me while I reminisce.   I was first in Rome in 1976. Due to luck or arrogance, I wound up staying with a couple of kind Romans who took good care of my wife and me. I do believe I had not yet eaten spaghetti a la carbonara (I do believe I had not yet heard of Marcella), but my better-traveled American friends insisted I order it immediately.   That I did not do. We went out to a little trattoria the first night, ordered something we were comfortable with, then spied a gent eating a huge bowl of mussels. We tried to change our order, but our confusion with the phrasebook led us to order mosquitoes, which they didn't have.   The next night we went to another place and ordered spaghetti carbonara and something unmemorable and got yelled at for ordering two primi and no secondo -- in those days they did that. But in those days we couldn't afford six dollars a person; we tried to stick to three. (If I remember correctly our daily budget for this trip, food-wise, was 15 dollars, for both of us. And we pretty much stuck to it.)   The carbonara was a mindblower. I grew up in New York, a mile from Little Italy. We ate lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, clams or mussels with tomato sauce, veal ""parmigiano"" with tomato sauce and so on. I am not sure I ever had an Italian dish whose roots were not in Naples or at least the South. It was my first inkling that Italian food was more complicated than what we saw in Manhattan and Brooklyn.   (Photo: Pizza with potatoes) But when we got back to where we were staying, Gigi -- the male half of the couple hosting us -- told me I'd made a mistake, that the true Roman dish was pasta all' amatriciana, essentially carbonara with tomato sauce replacing the eggs. Twenty years later, I came to understand the relationship between the two, and their progenitor, pasta alla Gricia (read it here). The next night Gigi took us out for amatriciana, and the mind boggled again.   At breakfast, he arrived with two white bags. In the first was pizza bianca. Can you imagine? White pizza, no cheese, a little oil and salt and rosemary? As an indication of how things have changed, I think it would now take someone bringing me a dish made with tempeh that I liked as much as a good grilled steak to come near the shock and joy I felt at seeing and tasting that pizza bianca.  And the other bag: pizza with potatoes, immediately and still my favorite all-carb dish. Had some just the other day, at the incomparable bakery in Campo de' Fiori, along with a couple of other beauties, pictured here. Whenever I become disenchanted with Rome -- whenever I see American-style pizza there -- I head to this place, as early in the morning as I can get there. It restores the faith. It practically makes me young. ",2008-03-11T19:56:43+0000

Julianna Margulies, the shows star, said the network wanted to bring a little FX to Fox. But young viewers showed little interest in Canterburys Law, as the shows premiere finished in fourth place in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic at 8 p.m. on Monday, Nielsen reported. Fox suggested that the transition to daylight saving time might have had some impact on the ratings. Canterburys Law averaged 7.6 million viewers, enough to place second in total viewers behind ABCs Bachelor, but delivered a disappointing 1.7 rating in the 18-to-49 demographic favored by advertisers. At 9 p.m. New Amsterdam picked up some viewers for Fox, averaging 8.8 million viewers and a 2.5 rating in that demographic. The 11.7 million viewers for Two and a Half Men and the 10.1 million viewers for CSI: Miami put CBS into first place for the night. NBC was a close second, as ho-hum viewership for My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad (6.9 million) was offset by high ratings for Deal or No Deal (11.6 million) and Medium (9.2 million). ABC placed fourth for the night with two episodes of the low-rated October Road (4.6 million at 9, and 4.8 million at 10).",2008-03-12T04:00:00+0000

It had just one bedroom, but its lineage was awfully smart: it had been built between 1959 and 1961 for Margaret Esherick, a relative of the sculptor Wharton Esherick, who gave the home its name, Esherick House. By 2004 the assessed value of the home, according to 2006 county tax rolls, was $303,000. But what do bureaucrats know of beauty? On May 18, the Wright auction house in Chicago, which specializes in 20th-century art and design, will be offering Esherick House in its Important Design sale. Richard Wright, the firms president, estimates that it will bring $2 million to $3 million. Louis Kahn only did three major architectural homes in his career, Mr. Wright said. Joe Rosa, the curator of the architectural department at the Art Institute of Chicago, who wrote a book on Louis Kahn, feels that it is his best residential structure.

Then theres labdanum, a natural resin from a Mediterranean bush that smells quite strongly like a dock workers armpit. Shalimar, created in 1925 by the perfumer Jacques Guerlain, is historically one of the most important perfumes ever made as it is arguably the progenitor of the entire category of parfums gourmands (culinary perfumes). But Shalimar is also a true oriental, which means vanilla plus labdanum, and that in turn means that Guerlain faces the challenge of selling this great early 20th-century work of art in the 21st-century global marketplace.",2008-03-13T12:08:11+0000

Now the Hutus were camped along the border, and dying by the thousands each day from starvation and disease. You are the United Nations representative charged with assisting these desperate refugees. But the individuals who control the camps are the very people who committed the genocide, and since any relief you provide has to flow through them, your help necessarily increases their authority. Whats more, they are hoping to return to their country and complete the genocidal work they began. Other humanitarian agencies are unwilling to aid the Hutus, even though it means that tens of thousands more may die, so you are their only hope. What do you do?",2008-03-13T13:36:32+0000

us,Axelrod and Penn," Democrats tend to make celebrities of their campaign consultants, which is why anyone who has closely followed this campaign could probably pick out Mark Penn or David Axelrod, the chief strategists for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, in a bar. To simply refer generically to these strategists as consultants, however, as if they were necessarily experts in the same craft, is to obscure important differences in how they got to where they aredifferences that can often be important to understanding the arc of a particular campaign. This long and remarkable struggle between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama has been a study not just in the brilliance and the blind spots of the candidates themselves, but also those of their most trusted  and highly paid  advisers. Mr. Axelrod is an ad guy. A man who perfected the craft of encapsulating an entire life in 30 seconds, he has a gift for telling personal stories in ways that people can understand. As my colleague Benjamin Wallace Wells wrote in a Times Magazine profile last year, Mr. Axelrods essential insight  the idea that has made him successful where others might have failed  is that the modern campaign really isnt about the policy arcana or the candidates record; its about a more visceral, more personal narrative. This is probably a big reason why Mr. Obama has, from the start, focused almost exclusively on broad themes of hope and change, drawing heavily on his own life story, rather than staking out any particularly new policy ground. In its tone and emphasis, Mr. Obamas campaign reflects all the attributes of a truly great political ad: the stirring words, the beautiful pictures, the simple and elegant storyline of a ruined political system and the man whose moment has arrived.",2008-03-13T16:12:42+0000

us,"Discovering an Intense, Crunchy Tomato","(Photo: Tomatoes, from left: big cherries/small plums; a Genovese; and the Raf, from Spain. (Mark Bittman)) I ate a lot of raw vegetables on this swing through France, Italy, and Spain -- some days, in fact, my stomach felt like a juicer. But when I go to markets I have to shop, and when I don't have a stove, I wind up eating uncooked beets, fennel, carrots, celery, green beans -- I love the big flat romanos -- and now even artichokes.   I didn't see really nice-looking tomatoes, though, until we got to Rome, where I bought two kinds. On the left here are some sort of big cherries/small plums; they were tender, ripe, sweet -- decent, not super-complex flavor. On the right were a kind that looked like a variety I used to grow, but found to be completely different: Nearly as hard as an apple, they had amazing intensity -- almost like tomato paste in crunchy form. I could not stop eating them. (They were, raw, better than any dish served to me at the fancy restaurant I was taken to that same night, one not worth writing about.)   They stumped me. One, I didn't know what they were; two, if they were this hard, why weren't they shipped, preferably directly to my house; three, who used them, and for what?   I was about to post a ""Help! Please!"" to Bitten, but I was also meeting Mario Batali in Spain, so I brought the remaining tomato over. He called it Genovese (though it was clearly grown in the south), and said it was a salad tomato; that Italians sliced it very, very thin, to mitigate its crunchiness; and that it was served with lettuce.   Makes sense to me, but I wish I had a case to play with. I want to see if they ever soften, and I want to cook with them. Next time.   Meanwhile, in Madrid's Mercado de Paz, a lovely neighborhood market (there are many), I encountered -- as I did last year at this time -- the quite similar Raf tomato (pictured on the right), which I believe is from Valencia (I was told the word was Valenciana in any case). Also highly prized, also fairly expensive (the equivalent of $3 or $4 a pound, which is really not all that bad, considering), also quite crunchy. Given that these experiences happened in the month of March, I was ready to move to southern Europe.   Needless to say I came home. I'll tidy up with a couple of remaining thoughts from the trip, and then back to reality. Also, stay tuned for a slide show of photos from the market. ",2008-03-14T18:12:29+0000

Leeson first realized the paintings significance.

Mr. Eisen has authenticated the work, which measures 19 inches by 14 inches and shows the composer in profile, wearing a red jacket that he once described in detail in a letter. Mr. Eisen, after studying Mozarts correspondence, archival documents and estate auction records, said he believed that the work was painted around 1783 by Joseph Hickel, a painter to the Imperial Court of Austria.

The best Gang Theorists focus not just on iconic figures but on the connections between them. For every telegenic chef there are a thousand anonymous immigrant cooks chopping alone, sweating the onions, changing everything; for every lauded late-night comedian, a thousand funnymen of the night shift, scratching by the hours with a ballpoint pen and a spiral-bound notebook, cracking up the security guard. Capturing this breadth, revealing the crummy details before the Gang gets its due, is what makes a lasting work of Gang Theory; its not just the number of characters that matters, but the depth and quality of the time spent with them, and the subtleties and candor of the stories they tell.",2008-03-16T04:00:00+0000

A timeworn piece of Hollywood wisdom (occasionally attributed to Dostoevsky, John Gardner or some other writer) holds that every narrative arises from one of two situations: Someone goes on a journey, or a stranger comes to town. The immigrants story, in its basic form, fulfills both of these archetypes. An individual or a family leaves a familiar world, by either choice, necessity or some perceived combination of the two, and arrives in a place that is as strange to the newcomers as they are to it.

Leach, like Ting, was born in the Far East and spent time in Japan before founding his own pottery studio in England. Several of Leachs disciples taught at Farnham, and Ting was so inspired he traveled to Japan to visit Shoji Hamada, who was Leachs friend and collaborator.

It will be no surprise, of course, if the Republicans continue to beat the drums of fear and resentment; one does not abandon an orientation so tried and true.

Getting (safely) close to the animals was just one of Trimbles directives in creating the Bears of Alaska Discovery Center, an educational facility outside Anchorage. He was also asked to include a walk-in freezer for storing moose meat and an exhibition space for teaching humans bear safety. Trimbles design, both environmentally and animal friendly, is an homage to indigenous Eskimo architecture, which he says is the ultimate in sustainable green living: planted roof, locally sourced timbers, natural light and heat retention.

A few dead Americans famous for doing things other than writing great erotic poems, like Francis Scott Key and Emma Lazarus, make an appearance; their poems are neither great nor really very erotic.

us,The Flowers,"Not that many years ago I would go to a house in the neighborhood, not always someone's I knew, one I'd never been inside of, where I'd only have to maybe hop a fence, nothing complicated, and from the backyard I'd crawl through an open window. People always latch the ones in the front but never in the back, and especially not the bathroom one, you know, and it wasn't so small I couldn't get in quick. I could've stole lots of [expletive] in those houses, except that's not what I was going in there for. I wasn't like that. Maybe I don't know exactly what I was doing except I was doing it. I never took nothing, nothing much if I did, because I didn't want to. I was more watching how the people lived, imagining how it would be in their house. I stared at the framed pictures they had of their family. Husbands in suits and wives with necklaces and old grandparents from the other times way before. Unsmiling dudes, glaring at you, in tilted military hats and coats with medals and ribbons. Full-body shots of happy daughters in white veils and lacy crunchy wedding dresses that poured all over into the bottom of the picture. Shocked little babies on blue backgrounds squinting like What's going on here, what's all this light [expletive]? Dopey-dumb I'm-so-proud high schoolers graduating and making a face like they were department store managers. If I felt like it, if I had the mood, I sprawled out on their couches or lay down on their beds. Go, How would I be if I lived here? I'd let that come into me, I'd let my mind go to the show it liked. Maybe you could say I would go off to my own world. To me it wasn't mine, nothing like mine, because it would go to black. I loved that color. It was like when the eyes aren't open but try to see. What would finally come were colors and lines busting through, flying out and off and cutting in, crazy fires and sparks, and it'd come out speeding, and I'd be like a doggie out the window, those lane dividers whiffing by on the freeway straight below an open car window. I'd start to see shapes floating and straightening and wiggling and see it like it was a music that didn't make sound but was making a story. Not a regular story and I don't mean one you would hear some loco nut tell you, one that didn't have nothing to do with people or places you've ever seen. It's that I can't describe it better. Just, I have to watch, I have to listen. It was always good too. Say like when you hear music and it gets inside your brain and goes and goes, sticking there. And so I guess it got in mine like that. I listened and watched until I stopped getting too stupid because, you know, I had to leave and get out of there fast. And once I got up, shook it off and remembered where I really was, even if I opened their refrigerator, when I looked inside, wasn't like I didn't think of eating or drinking, I didn't take even a soda, thirsty as I might have been. I didn't want them to know I'd been there. Though I kind of opened the fridge door because maybe I do think of  well, like orange juice. It's that I like orange juice. So maybe when there was some orange juice I might have taken a gulp or two. But see, even then, nobody'd really know. One time I was in this one house, and I was looking inside a drawer in this girl's bedroom. I knew about her because she was this dude's older sister, and she was in junior college.

us,Could Bear Stearns Do Better?,"It's not surprising that Bear Stearns's stock plummeted Monday after JPMorgan Chase agreed to buy it for just $2 per share. The surprising part is that it didn't plummet even more.  After closing at $30 Friday, Bear's stock hovered at about $4 late Monday morning, suggesting that investors expected to get something more than what JPMorgan has offered. But what? The securities firm was nearly forced to shut its doors because of a severe liquidity crunch. As a company that was preparing a bankruptcy filing over the weekend in case the sale effort failed, Bear seems to be in no position to negotiate.   A number of possibilities come to mind.  Investors may think that JPMorgan will increase its price, if only to avoid being seen as a vulture. Theoretically, Bear's shareholders can vote against the deal, though it would take 12 months to reject it fully under Sunday's merger agreement.  Though the deal price is about $270 million, JPMorgan has said that the true cost of acquiring Bear will be much higher -- as much as $6 billion -- when litigation, severance and other costs are taken into account. So in principle, increasing the per-share price would have a relatively small effect on the overall cost of buying Bear.  Wall Street seems to think JPMorgan is getting a huge bargain: Shares of JPMorgan were up 10 percent Monday, even as other financial firms took a nosedive. Its market capitalization grew by $12 billion, paying for Bear Stearns several times over.  Investors may also be putting hope in the idea that another bidder could step up, such as a private equity firm.  That could be difficult, however. Many analysts think JPMorgan's close ties to Bear, including its role as the go-between for Bear's federally backed bailout loan, have already put it at an advantage over other buyers.  And JPMorgan has another leg up over a rival bidder: Bear has already given JPMorgan the ""irrevocable"" option to buy its New York headquarters even if the takeover deal falls through, according to the merger agreement, which Bear posted on its Web site Monday.   Finally, Bear shareholders may see another potential source of funds: lawsuits.   A report from Reuters on Monday suggested that law firms were being inundated with calls from angry investors looking for answers -- and, presumably, some payouts for their pain.

us,New Yorks New Landmarks,"Webster Hall, a 19th-century East Village assembly space where F. Scott Fitzgerald once reveled and Emma Goldman urged social change, was one of several buildings designated historic landmarks on Monday by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Designed by Charles Rentz and built in 1886, with an annex added in 1992, Webster Hall, a Renaissance Revival structure at 119-125 East 11th Street, is clad in red Philadelphia pressed brick with brownstone trim and red terra-cotta ornamentation. (A mansard roof was destroyed in the 1930s.) The hall, seen above in the 1910s, became famous for masquerade balls after a 1913 fund-raiser for the socialist magazine The Masses and became a hub not only for Village bohemians but also for gay men and lesbians. The artists Charles Demuth, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray used the hall, as did F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and political and labor leaders like Goldman, Samuel Gompers, Margaret Sanger and Dorothy Day. The Progressive Labor Party was established there in 1887, and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1914. In the 1950s and 60s, RCA Victor operated a studio there, where Arthur Rubinstein, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Marian Anderson and many others recorded. Webster Hall later became a rock club. Three other East Village structures also received landmark designation: the 11th Street Public Bath, at 539 East 11th Street, a Beaux-Arts structure designed by Arnold W. Brunner and completed in 1906; the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Anshe Ungarn, at 242 East Seventh Street, a Beaux Arts synagogue built in 1908 for a congregation of Hungarian Jews; and the Elizabeth Home for Girls, at 307 East 12th Street, a High Victorian Gothic brick and sandstone structure built in 1892 for use by the Childrens Aid Society.",2008-03-19T04:00:00+0000

But he suggested that he might have used a campaign credit card for personal expenses when his did not work. It is illegal to spend campaign money for personal use, although by quickly making a reimbursement, a candidate would most likely avoid any penalties. (See related blog post.)

us,Last Night in Bullet Points,"Media days for the auto show begin Wednesday, but the parties started Tuesday night. Increasingly, the New York auto show is where automakers are throwing their most lavish soirees.   &#x2022; The hip-hop artist Common played live at the Sirius studios, across the street from Radio City Music Hall, to promote the partnership between Sirius Satellite Radio and Lincoln cars.  &#x2022; A Ford spokesman said that the partnership was a sign that Lincoln is redefining the brand. He's right. Years ago, they probably would have signed Kenny G.  &#x2022; Mark Fields gave the intro speech, which he closed by saying, ""Common will be kicking it live!"" I think he was trying to be ironic.  &#x2022; Common arrived sans huge posse or entourage. He was wearing matching shirt and scarf, crisp jeans and shoes that were the color of Timberland work boots. Everything looked fresh and new. He looked like a Gap ad.  &#x2022; Since the performance was broadcast live on Sirius, it started on time and the musicians played inside a small Plexiglas room, like Magneto's jail cell at the end of ""X-Men."" There were two layers of Plexi and several of us on the outside wondered if he could hear us clapping. There were two tall towers of speakers for us to hear him, but there didn't seem to be any speakers into the Plexi cube, which also made for terrible photography.  (Photo: Common, right, with Tony Touch, a radio personality. (Photograph by Richard Chang for The New York Times))   &#x2022; At the same time, Sheryl Crow (of Fleetwood Mac?) played at the Mercedes-Benz party, called the House of Bluetec because it was publicizing the company's series of diesel vehicles. Ms. Crow has become a vocal advocate of environmenal causes, to the point of engaging Karl Rove in a well-publicized confrontation last year at the White House correspondents' dinner, and in the course of her performance she repeatedly lauded her hosts and urged them to develop a Bluetec bus for her touring needs. We'll have more on that later...  &#x2022; In keeping with the blue/blues/Bluetec theme, waiters circulated with trays of blue drinks, including a medicinal-tasting blueberry vodka concoction that Ms. Crow likened to urea, the secret ingredient that cleanses the emissions of Bluetec engines.   &#x2022; After a spirited set of mostly familiar songs, Ms. Crow closed her set with ""Everyday Is a Winding Road."" Yes, the same song used as background music in the Subaru commercials.  &#x2022; Other celebrities circulated in the House of Bluetec crowd, we were told, but the only one we instantly recognized was Christian Siriano, the androgynous enfant terrible who recently emerged victorious in the ""Project Runway"" fashion designer-reality show. He was not drinking blue cocktails but he looked, well, FIERCE.  (Photo: Sheryl Crow at the House of Bluetec. (Photograph by Jerry Garrett for The New York Times))   &#x2022; Ford was giving rides around Manhattan in the Flex, which comes out in June. The one I rode to the Saab party at the IAC building along the West Side Highway had a fridge and freezer built into the second row seat armrest. If I had grown up rich, the Flex fridge probably would've sparked memories of my childhood limo. But I grew up upper middle class (at least that's what my parents told me) and I suddenly thought about the big plastic cooler that we took on road trips and my mom stuffed with sandwiches and grapes.  &#x2022; The Flex was also equipped with Ford's next-generation navigation system, which has an amazing voice recognition system. It could hear me from the back seat. I asked the Ford public relations rep if it could locate restaurants near where we were and he said, ""I'm hungry,"" and a list of restaurants popped up on the screen. That's when I realized that I needed a navigation system for my life.  &#x2022; Saab closed out the night with a party at the IAC building that was still going when I left around midnight.  (Photo: Saab is showing its 9-X BioHybrid Concept at the New York show. (Photograph by Richard Chang for The New York Times))   &#x2022; There was a brief fashion show to reveal a line of ""eco clothing"" created by Swedish designer Josefin Lassbo.  &#x2022; Everything in the collection was made of 100 percent Bio-cotton, which is a real classification. You can find the collection at Saab Expressions Web site.  &#x2022; The show lasted about seven minutes.  Related:  Times Topics: New York Auto Show ",2008-03-19T13:29:28+0000

us,City Room: The Leaning Landmark of Broadway," The expansive cast-iron facades of 287 Broadway seen from the north. The building was designated a landmark in 1989. Enlarge this image. (Photo: David W. Dunlap/The New York Times) See a Slide Show  Talk about endangered landmarks.   The elegant cast-iron building at 287 Broadway, which ""graphically illustrates the transformation of lower Broadway in the 19th century from a residential boulevard into the citys commercial center"" (as the Landmarks Preservation Commission put it), is leaning about eight inches to the south.   This month, steel shoring is being erected against its south facade to replace the timber bracing that has been in place since late last year. The entire six-story building was vacated Nov. 29 by order of the Department of Buildings, leaving the Pizza Cafe, at the corner of Reade Street, with Christmas holiday decorations still hanging.   ""Our engineers feel strongly that 287 Broadway is stable and can be salvaged,"" said Kate Lindquist, press secretary at the buildings agency. But for the moment, there is no saying when.    That has left the buildings tenants in limbo, uncompensated and uncertain when they can return home or resume business.   ""They all know who did it,"" said David Jaroslawicz, the lawyer for the Yenem Corporation, proprietors of the Pizza Cafe. ""Theres no secret here. But nobodys stepped up to the plate to say: 'Wed like to take care of the tenants and the commercial space. And were sorry.""'   The ""who,"" Mr. Jaroslawicz said, is the John Buck Company of Chicago, a large development concern that is planning a 20-story condominium apartment building called 57 Reade Street, which will form an L shape around the landmark. It was designed by SLCE Architects.   ""I do not intend to comment,"" Greg Merdinger, a principal in the John Buck Company, said by e-mail. ""My goal is to simply finish construction of the building.""  As the story goes, however, 287 Broadway was already leaning about four inches when excavation for 57 Reade Street began last spring, as permitted by the city. During excavation, monitors attached to the landmark recorded up to four more inches of movement. The city was notified. A vacate order was issued.   Timber shoring, required by the city, was designed by Richard Herschlag, whom the city identified as the developers engineer. It was built by Hunter Atlantic Inc., which the city said was also responsible for the new steel shoring.   ""To safely rescind the vacate order, the remedial work on the foundation of 287 Broadway must be underway,"" Ms. Lindquist said. ""The developers engineer is working to find a way to perform the remedial work on the foundation. We expect the engineer will submit a plan for review within the month. At that time, we can better assess when the vacate order can be safely rescinded.""  The saga has attracted coverage in The Tribeca Trib and amNewYork and has drawn comments on the Curbed and Lost City blogs, among others.   Mr. Jaroslawicz said the situation pointed to the need for an insurance or bonding mechanism by which owners who were deprived of their businesses by construction accidents could be quickly compensated, rather than waiting years for the courts to straighten things out  as will almost certainly be the case at 287 Broadway.   ""The general contractor is going to blame the underpinning subcontractor, whos going to blame the plant overseer, whos going to blame the guy operating the backhoe, whos going to blame the guy operating the crane,"" he said. ""And all the lawyers are going to have a feeding frenzy for the next couple of years.""   There is something curiously appropriate about this, since 287 Broadway has been home to numerous lawyers offices since its completion in 1872. John B. Snook, a leading architect of the day (the original Grand Central was his work), designed the structure for the estate of Stephen Storm, combining Italianate and French Second Empire styles.   ""The prestige of the building was indicated both by the mansard roof and an early Otis passenger elevator,"" the landmarks commission said in its 1989 designation report. It added, ""Above the first story, the exterior of 287 Broadway looks much as it did in 1872."" This includes a 96-foot-long facade on Reade Street with 52 enormous arched windows, six of them set in monumental dormers.   Antoine Scott, a street vendor on Broadway, has been watching the structural drama from his table full of socks, hats and gloves. ""Im just hoping that doesnt fall down when Im working here,"" he said. ""Thats what Im talking about.""   Mr. Jaroslawicz did not sound too confident about the fate of the ""leaning tower of pizza,"" as he calls it. ""Dont breathe too heavily,"" he cautioned. ""It might collapse.""  But city officials sound confident that 287 can and will be saved. ""Absolutely,"" said John Weiss, deputy counsel of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.   ""Unless it was determined by the Department of Buildings that there was an immediate danger to public safety and the building had to be taken down right away,"" Mr. Weiss continued, ""a permit would have to be obtained from Landmarks for demolition.   ""It would be fair to say that the chance would be infinitesimal that the landmarks commission would authorize demolition of that landmark."" ",2008-03-19T14:52:39+0000

us,"Buicks Y-Job, the First Dream Car","(Photo: Buick Y-Job on display at Cipriani on Tuesday night. (Photograph by Norman Mayersohn for The New York Times))   The stars of any auto show -- the vehicles we remember years later -- are invariably the wild design exercises that demonstrate what the studios can do when unconstrained by any need to actually sell a product.  Credit for the concept of concept cars is generally given to Harley J. Earl, the legendary General Motors design chief who created the Buick Y-Job in 1938. A sleek black two-seater with prominent ""speed lines"" running down the fenders, the Y-Job pioneered many styling features that are still seen today, tricks like hidden headlights and a metal hatch cover for the folded convertible top.   (Photo:  (Photograph by Norman Mayersohn for The New York Times))   Though I had seen many vintage photos of the car, I saw it in person for the first time on Tuesday, at a press program Buick held in Manhattan to talk about its design lineage. Looking at the long, low shape parked inside the cavernous Cipriani banquet hall across from Grand Central on 42nd Street, it was easy to see why the Y-Job was so influential. It is a powerful statement, and it previewed many design themes that Buick used for years.  But perhaps the best thing about the car was its original condition. It is beautiful, but not perfect. Small pits in the chrome trim and wrinkles in the seat leather confirm that this car actually saw some service. That earned points from me -- it's a lot more authentic than modern concept cars that are sometimes little more than clay models dressed for their stage debuts.

us,Driving Mitsubishis Future,"(Photo: Mitsubishi plans to start selling the i-MiEV electric vehicle in Japan next year.)   On Tuesday, I spent an hour driving the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, an electric vehicle based on its Japan-only i city car. The i is a kei car, a specific classification of cars that is required to be of a certain size and engine displacement.  Yes, Mitsubishi has an electric car.  Yes, it's supposed to go on sale in 2009 in Japan. Moreover, Mitsubishi is expected to announce on Thursday that it will provide a fleet of EVs to an agency on the West Coast this year.  Unlike most driving events held during the New York auto show, my drive in the i-MiEV was without minder, in the best sense. There was no predetermined route and no one to tell me to take things slow and stay on the straight and smooth highway.  I drove the car to Brooklyn. The i-MiEV runs on an electric motor that's placed above the rear axle (the conventional i also has a rear-midship engine). The lithium-ion batteries are under the rear seats, fore of the engine. Range is 80 to 100 miles.  (Photo: The i-MiEV is recharged by plugging into household outlets.)   There are lots of benefits for having the motor back there, Maurice Durand, a Mitsubishi spokesman, told me. One of them is that it has allowed Mitsubishi to narrow the frame in the front, which gives the front wheels serious steering angle and improves turning radius.  Earlier in the day, I spent about 30 minutes in the standard i, which is powered by a 660cc 3-cylinder engine. The i-MiEV accelerates just as well, if not a bit better. On F.D.R. Drive, I took the car up to 110 kilometers an hour (around 68 miles an hour) and passed a cube truck or two. Mr. Durand said the car can hit 85.  Because of their short wheelbase, kei cars have always been known for offering fluffball rides. But Mitsubishi has maximized the length dimensions of the class, and the i-MiEV has a particularly long wheelbase for its size. If the wheels on the i-MiEV were pushed toward the edges any further, they'd be off the car. As a result, the i-MiEV felt stable on both the highway and the tattered streets of downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn; just stay away from cobblestones.  In Brooklyn, a man named Moishe asked, ""Why can't we have this car now?""   After I explained that it was still in the testing phase, he asked, ""Yeah, but why can't we have it now?""  As I considered my response, he added, ""You know, with gas prices getting so expensive.""  Moishe wasn't the only enthusiastic observer. A postman offered to trade car keys. ""I can really use something like this,"" he said. A woman commented on the interior size. ""It looks small on the outside, but inside it's like a Toyota.""  The interior of the i-MiEV, which is in fleets in Japan, looks almost exactly like the standard i, which has enough space for four adults. Even the dashboard looks standard, which is an oddity in the world of hybrid vehicles. There's no colorful electric bar to let you know what the electric motor is doing or that the battery is recharging.  Like many gas-electric hybrids on the road, the i-MiEV has a regenerative braking system, which means the battery recharges under braking. And this does affect brake feel -- slight pulses can be felt underfoot. Charging the battery can also be done by plugging into a 110- or 220-volt outlet. Charge time is 7-14 hours. In Japan, the i-MiEV can be quick-charged in 30 minutes by plugging into a special outlet.  By the time I looped back to the Mitsubishi's temporary headquarters at Chelsea Piers, I had been on the road for a little more than an hour. I had used up approximately half of the charge. Not bad, but Mr. Durand said that Mitsubishi is targeting a range of 160 miles, which will make it more effective for commuters.

(Photo: James Hill for The New York Times. More photographs))  March 25, 2003: Leaving the Euphrates, the road north loses its asphalt and becomes sand. Along the route are more Bedouin either asking for handouts of food or to change dinars for dollars. One soldier exchanged a packet of cigarettes for a 250-dinar bill. When one of his colleagues saw he had a bill with a portrait of Saddam Hussein, he demanded, Why dya want to get a bill with that [expletive] on it?  Suddenly a huge sandstorm has blown up and we can barely see a few feet in front of us. The convoy just stops, swallowed in a yellow haze. The men all put on their goggles, scarves, and sheltered as best they could. In one truck a marine was resolutely eating a pack of Skittles in the teeth of the storm.  The sands drift by as we sit in the car doing nothing. The straps hum and flap, making sounds like an indigenous instrument. The car rocks constantly, such is the strength of the wind. We wait, which I have now realized is a military specialty, though it is hard not to be unhappy, disoriented from losing sight of our surroundings. The weather feels like a much more potent enemy than the Iraqi Army and we feel swallowed by it.  (Photo: A line of Humvees passed a palm grove in Baghdad in April 2003. (Photo: James Hill for The New York Times))  March 26: The sandstorm was still blowing this morning, but a shadow of its former self. We hooked up with another convoy heading north, pushing almost 100 kilometers forward. Our new camp for the night had been the site of an ambush by Iraqi forces on a Marine convoy just ahead of us, and two dead soldiers lay on the side of the road, one face down in the mud, the other staring at the sky as convoy after convoy of military vehicles moved by. I counted at least 15 bodies, and there were many prisoners, nearly all badly dressed and without shoes. An amber fog still hung over them as they huddled in a barbed-wire pen.  One of the seriously wounded had been shot in the head by his officer for refusing to fight. Many other soldiers claimed they had been press-ganged into service and that their families were being kept by forces loyal to Saddam. In all they looked a miserable bunch and hardly a match for these marines.  The American Marine doctor was caring for them and evacuated some out by helicopter. He denied Americans were being moved first. The most serious went first, he said, irrespective of nationality.  (Photo: Marine vehicles drove past a dead Iraqi soldier outside Nasariya in March 2003. (Photo: James Hill for The New York Times))  April 2: We drove through the night, no easy task since everyone has night-vision goggles except us. Awaking early this morning I see two Iraqis being questioned by the side of the road as an enormous convoy of armored vehicles stretched into the distance.  It turned out they were two men who had been caught in the firefight for the Saddam Canal the night before, and a friend of theirs, who had stood up wearing a red bandana to see what was going on, was unsurprisingly killed.  A Marine major went with them to help retrieve the body, which was lying by the bridge. Together they put it into two black plastic bags and then carried it to the Iraqis car. Only the body was too big and by now too stiff to fit in the car. The three of them stood there like cheap Mafia hit men wondering how to dispose of the body. Eventually they managed to squeeze it in and the Iraqis drove away, saying thank you to the major, and meaning it, even though it was the Americans who had killed their friend. The major said sorry and meant it. Such is the perversity of war.  On the front the Americans have pushed a long way today. At dusk, on the Tigris, marines were in rubber boats securing the far bank as engineers were constructing pontoon bridges. A tank captain parked near the river, Ted Card, was moaning that the Iraqis were cowards. My men keep asking me, he told me, When are we going to see some action?. Meanwhile we are now in M.O.P.P. 2 [Measures of Personal Protection], which means we have to wear vast rubber overboots on our feet that make them feel like fish in an oven.  April 7: Immediately after waking up we heard on the radio about a large incursion by the Third Infantry Division into the center of the city. The final phase has begun.  Today they (and we mercifully) went to M.O.P.P. 0, which means we can all take off our chemical suits, which have protected us psychologically but otherwise made us do nothing but sweat.  Changing into trousers, even dirty ones, feels like a great luxury.  Putting them on though I can feel how much weight I have lost in the last few weeks. Anxiety is obviously a terrific hunger suppressant.  The Fifth Battalion of First Marines, with whom we are camped, seems to in no hurry to go anywhere, so we decide to swing back west to find the Seventh Marines.  At this point the embedded/unilateral issue doesnt seem to matter. We arrive at a military column in a GMC Yukon and its Welcome to the war.  The battalion is waiting to cross a bridge over the Diyala River.  On the other bank it is already Baghdad. We stay 500 meters from the bridge while the sounds of battle thunder ahead. It is very hard to understand how much is Iraqi fire. After about three hours there is silence.  Dexter, using his full New York Times muscle, persuades the colonel of the battalion to let us across before any of the other journalists. The Iraqis had tried to blow the bridge but failed. On the right there are the charred remains of T-55 tanks and the bodies of a few badly dressed soldiers. A fire at an oil depot rages on a bit further down the road.  As dusk falls we end up proceeding with an armored column into an abandoned area. Turning into an unknown street, just ahead of us a truck filled with ammunition is ablaze, spitting out bullets, which we can avoid only by attempting to shield behind a large armored vehicle. It is plain idiocy what we are doing, and both Dexter and I know it. But we go ahead nonetheless even though our bravery turns out to be a mistake. Suddenly we find ourselves at the head of the advance and only three tanks between us and the Iraqis. The colonel of the battalion finds us and screams at us, sending us back to the bridge. So we double back, passing the burning truck and through a mine field cleared a few hours before.  Greeting us at the bridge is a horde of flies buzzing lazily from the rotting corpses nearby and a thick oily haze from the nearby depot whose angry flames light up the nearby sky.  April 8: I slept fitfully through the night, waking up constantly from the tarry smoke and in the morning light found a flattened dog only a few meters from my head. ",2008-03-19T19:52:56+0000

us,Lutz Leaves the Bunny Ears at Home,"Put away the eggs and the baskets. Send the bunny outfit to the cleaners. General Motors has put off Easter till July.  Last fall, Bob Lutz, the outspoken product czar at General Motors, promised that G.M. would have a significant announcement about the battery technology for its Volt plug-in electric car around the time of the New York auto show. Responding to what he perceived as a putdown of G.M.'s technology by Toyota engineers (a perception not shared by some of the journalists who were present at the Toyota briefing in Japan where the comments were supposedly made), Mr. Lutz issued this challenge:  Lets wait for the Easter Bunny. Somebodys going to have egg on their face. And I dont like having egg on my face. The implicit message was that G.M. would come to the New York show, which opens Easter weekend, with a demonstration of the extended battery range of the Volt. Mr. Lutz has promised to have the Volt on the market (perhaps with a different name, and certainly with a revised, more aerodynamic look) by the end of 2010.  But G.M. ended up at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with an Easter basket bereft of newfangled batteries, at least for public demonstration. In an interview, Mr. Lutz grumbled that Easter (and the New York show) fell exceptionally early this year. ""We could have done the vehicle by Easter, but we didn't have the power electronics ready,"" he said, explaining that the messages being sent from the controls (like the accelerator) were not yet being processed quickly enough and translated into performance. ""The effect would be lousy acceleration,"" he added.  Now, he said, a July demonstration seems more likely, of cars that will have the essential Volt powertrain in last-generation Malibu bodies. (The design of the production model is not finished.)   The overall Volt development program is on track, Mr. Lutz said, citing both the powertrain engineering and the vehicle's design, which are proceeding on parallel fast tracks in isolated facilities at the G.M. Design Center in Warren, Mich.   While externally, the Volt's lithium-ion batteries have been viewed as the biggest hurdle to production, ""up to this point we have no reason to believe that's a stumbling block,"" Mr. Lutz said. He added that the design had passed computer simulations for crash worthiness, but that real-world testing remained to be done.  The goal remains a range of 40 miles on battery power alone, with a small gasoline engine kicking in after that to recharge the batteries. The batteries need to last 10 years, he said.  And once they do die, how much would it cost to replace them? While declining to be specific, Mr. Lutz said the price tag would be ""more than several thousand dollars, but less than $10,000.""

us,Uncovering the Art of Veiling,"Auto shows are all about the unveiling of new models. But before they are unveiled, cars must be veiled.   The design of the veils is revealing. At Saabs party in the IAC Building, the iceberg-like glass structure designed by Frank Gehry, the veils were arctic white and gauzy. The 9-X BioHybrid concept, also white, peeked out from behind its veil like a bride. The glacial white seemed appropriately Scandinavian.   (Photo: Veiled Saabs. (Photograph by Phil Patton for The New York Times))   Across town, Kia rented the Exit Art gallery on 10th Avenue for the premier of its Koup concept. On Tuesday afternoon, the Koup stood naked and red while the designers Peter Schreyer and Tom Kearns contemplated covering it. They agreed on the beauty of what they called the swoosh shape along the Koup's side and Kias new twin-tab grille face.  But designing the cover for the car to attend its coming out party was harder. The crisply outlined car stood in a room of red cloth of a certain bordello flavor, a choice perhaps appropriate to local political news. It was left to Alex Fedorak, the Kia publicity chief, to decide just how to fold the red cloth over the car, which was to be half concealed for the companys party Wednesday night. The car was to be unveiled Thursday morning at Kia's press conference in the Javits convention center.  (Photo: Kia, partially uncovered. (Photograph by Phil Patton for The New York Times))   At the party, held with Vans, the skateboard shoemaker, the Koup posed teasingly clad for journalists. The Koups cloth cover left a front and a rear corner exposed, and hung as thick as drapery in a David painting. From the rear, the red cloth suggested a wrapped coffin.  Draping is design, too. Draping is not easy; it must offer seductive hints, mixed with virtuous concealment.  Related:  Full Coverage: New York Auto Show ",2008-03-20T13:43:36+0000

us,Volvo Bumps Up Its Safety Systems,"(Photo: Volvo XC60. (Photograph by Jonathan Fickies/Getty Images))   Few companies have reputation for safety like Volvo's. So naturally when the company introduces a new suite of safety technologies people sit up and take notice. I visited with Volvo at the New York auto show and found that rather than making some radical new safety statements, the company's latest systems build on established methods.  I spent half an hour chatting with Thomas Broberg, Volvos senior technical adviser for safety, about the new package it calls City Safety that will be standard on the Volvo XC60, which comes out this fall. Its actually a collection of technologies that work in concert and are aimed at, in Mr. Brobergs words, assisting distracted drivers.  Headlining the City Safety package is the low-speed automatic braking system, which works at speeds of less than 20 miles an hour. Thats the danger zone for urban fender benders in stop-and-go traffic. So the Volvo system employs a light detection and ranging (or LIDAR) system positioned on the windshield just behind the rearview mirror. A laser is aimed a few feet in front of the vehicle and looks for reflections from, say, bumpers and license plates of other vehicles. When it detects that youre rapidly approaching such a reflection and havent made a move to stop, the car automatically brakes to a stop. And then it flashes at you, so that you dont think somethings wrong with your car.   Recalling how difficult it is for troopers using LIDAR to catch speeders in the rain, I asked about how it would work under such conditions. Mr. Broberg assured me the system would continue to work in the rain because the laser gun is in the cars wiper zone. And while its not designed to detect pedestrians, in some tests it has been successful at doing just that. However, Mr. Broberg emphasized that this is not the systems intended purpose (so aggravated XC60 owners should avoid the temptation to take aim at jaywalking New Yorkers).  All of this is sure to grab consumers' attention. However, rather than representing an entirely new technology City Safety is a maturation of technologies that began with adaptive cruise control and collision warning packages. Those systems also monitor the relative distances between vehicles and brake when necessary. But what really caught my eye was the companys often-overlooked drowsy driver safety system, a k a Driver Alert Control.  I.B.M. and others have research departments that are actively developing interior camera and retina detection systems designed to catch napping drivers. But such systems have yet to appear in cars because they are technically challenging and expensive. So Volvo took a different approach by building on technology already available: the lane departure warning system.   The current lane-departure system alerts drivers with an audible warning should they cross the line without signaling. Its designed to prevent single-vehicle lane-departure crashes as well as head-on collisions. But Volvo gave the system a new twist that could make it even more useful.  Alert drivers are always looking ahead down the road and keep the car in the lane smoothly, explained Mr. Broberg. But drowsy drivers tend to start looking shorter distances ahead and have more trouble keeping the car in the lane. Such drivers tend to make micro corrections in steering to keep the vehicle between the lines, according to Mr. Broberg. So the driver alert system uses the same camera and computer technology used for the lane-departure system but adds another program that looks for those telltale micro corrections.  To test the concept and the technology, Mr. Broberg said Volvo used volunteers who were not allowed to sleep for 24 hours. Then they fed the drivers a big, heavy meal (who says theres no free lunch?), denied them coffee, and then put them behind the wheel on a closed course. Drivers were also not allowed to blast the radio or roll down the windows. (I didnt ask about pinching themselves.) And, of course, the cars were equipped with secondary controls and a copilot should the volunteers actually fall asleep at the wheel.  The test bore out the research departments thesis about micro corrections. So now when the cars computer detects that the driver has been making a series of jerky steering inputs, the vehicle audibly suggests he or she should take a brake break.   Many of us will note that the same drowsy driver zigs and zags are also indicative of cellphone Chatty Cathys and Kens. Indeed, Volvo hopes the alerts will also prompt some drivers to get off the phone. If all cars were outfitted with such systems, I think it might also bring some additional civility to the roadways. After all, its certainly more polite that the typical New Yorkers honking and hand gestures. ",2008-03-20T22:31:29+0000

(Photograph by Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times))   Honeyed hair, trim builds, hip-hugging racing suits: the two female stars of Hyundais Genesis press conference were models, hired for their looks, right? You wish, guys. As top Hollywood stuntwomen, Melissa Stubbs and Kathy Jarvis not only know their way around roundhouse kicks and perilous falls, they could likely whip every journalist in attendance around a racetrack -- in a car or motorcycle.  Hyundai hired the women to twirl a pair of its new Genesis coupes during its Wednesday press conference. But the spins and slides they executed around the makeshift indoor course were childs play compared to their usual work: flipping burning cars, jumping motorcycles, swan-diving through glass ceilings, you name it.   (Photo: Kathy Jarvis, left, and Melissa Stubbs. (Photograph by Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times))   Ms. Jarvis and Ms. Stubbs have racked up stunt credits in everything from ""The Italian Job"" to the upcoming Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. Ms. Stubbs has been a stuntwoman for 20 years and has doubled for the likes of Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Ashley Judd, and Jessica Alba. She also teaches motorcycle skills to celebrities, including actor Antonio Banderas; you can check out her work at her Web site.   After wrapping the Hyundai action scene, Ms. Stubbs told me that she started doing stunt work at age 17. A mentor had encouraged her to become a stunt driver to extend her budding career.   Your body starts to break down, and you can only do it for so long, said Ms. Stubbs, whose own breakdowns include three broken legs. If you can drive, you can keep working for many more years.  Ms. Jarvis, meanwhile, is an accomplished off-road racer, an instructor at Team ONeil Rally School in New Hampshire, and the founder of Femme Fatale Motorsports, which is dedicated to bringing more women into auto racing. She is also keeping her fingers crossed, hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to drive faster than any human being before.   Adventurer Steve Fossett had been planning to break an 11-year-old ultimate land-speed record -- he called it ""Target 800 m.p.h."" -- when the aircraft he was piloting disappeared over Nevada last September. Mr. Fossett was recently declared dead, but Target 800 m.p.h. is proceeding as planned. And Kathy Jarvis is on a short list of drivers to fill in for him, seeking to break the current mark of 766 m.p.h. over a one-mile run.  Ms. Jarvis said the team prefers a woman driver, in part because of the extremely tight cockpit in the 4.5-ton, 47-foot-long racer.  Shes preparing to take high-speed, low-altitude runs with a jet pilot to acclimate to the G-force stresses she would have to endure to break 800 miles per hour in a planned summer run at the Bonneville Salt Flats. The low altitude is required to experience the dramatic blurring of scenery and effects on vision while hugging the ground at supersonic speeds.  At that speed, your peripheral vision is shut down because your heart cant get blood to your head, she said.   Team backers plan to run at Bonneville during the worst heat of the summer; higher temperatures push the sonic barrier to higher speeds, which will get racers closer to their record-setting speed when they hit the resistance caused by breaching the speed of sound.

us,Lexus: 19 Reasons to Crank It Up,"Taking a break from pounding the carpets at the New York auto show, I spent a few minutes drifting off in the soft seats of the Lexus LS 600h L, the companys six-figure luxury hybrid. Closing my eyes, I was reminded of an often neglected part of the driving experience: the sound system.  Lexus began offering a premium Mark Levinson sound system in its vehicles back in the 2001 model year. The current top-of-the-line system is the Mark Levinson Reference Surround, a true surround sound system boasting 19 speakers and 450 watts of power.  Mere power and multiple speakers arent enough to make a high fidelity sound system, however. A lot more engineering goes into generating sonic clarity, including thousands of hours devoted to tuning the system to the peculiarities of a cars cabin, with all of its reflective glass, unusual angles and sound eating seats.   Mark Levinson clearly took its time in this case. The sound is crisp without becoming harsh and precise without losing its warmth. I found that the Reference system even made music I find immensely distasteful sound (that Yanni-style fluff that companies often demo for the press), well, wondrous. The dynamic range was surprisingly open and accurate.  By the way, when I say true surround, I mean the Mark Levinson system delivers 5.1 discrete channels of music, rather than just simulating the surround effect with digital signal processing. But why would you want this, considering the paucity of surround sound music CDs? Because when you want to make a rest stop you can push a button to engage the cars automatic parking brake and then be allowed to watch DVDs on the dashboard screen -- in full surround sound theater mode. Now thats a real respite. ",2008-03-21T18:54:20+0000

us,The Flying Game,"(Photo: The Milner Motors AirCar prototype still needs clearance for take-off. (Photograph by Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times))   At the Detroit auto show, the basement is where youll find all the crazy one-off vehicles, the misshapen ogres unfit for the harsh glare of the lights above, and the Chinese automakers. At the New York show, the basement is the place to go when youre sick of looking at cars that dont fly. Because the Lamborghinis and whatnot upstairs are all very nice, but compared with a Milner Motors AirCar theyre all somewhat lacking in ambition.  I dont know much about flying cars, having never driven or flown one myself, but it seems to me that the main challenge is that planes have wings, and wings are a nuisance in the Home Depot parking lot. The Milner solution is to fit the AirCar with power folding wings that reduce overall width to seven feet in ground mode.   But it turns out that the wing issue isnt the only technological hurdle. After speaking with Chris Milner, a partner in Milner Motors, I came to realize why the promise of so many Popular Mechanics covers has yet to become reality, why the skies arent filled with Chevys. It turns out that its not a question of making a car that flies, its a question of making a plane that drives. And planes dont make very good cars for reasons besides just the wings.   For instance, weight distribution on an airplane is somewhat different than it is on a car. As in, 90 percent of the weight is on the rear wheels, so that the nose can be angled skyward on takeoff. Naturally, a 10-90 front-rear weight distribution would be less than ideal when it comes to, say, steering around corners (though I suspect Porsche could figure out how to make it work surprisingly well). So in addition to the folding wings, the AirCar has an adjustable wheelbase, with the rear wheels swinging into an aft position for road driving. Thats one thing.  Another problem is power. Planes dont have driven wheels, and apparently itd be poor form to throttle up the AirCars twin rotary-powered ducted pusher fans in the ol neighborhood cul de sac. So for ground work, the AirCar carries a 40 horsepower electric motor hooked to a continuously variable transmission. Top speed: 85 miles an hour. In the air, the 300 total horsepower from the rotaries make for a more impressive 200-mile-an-hour cruising speed.  Of course, those airborne specifications are just a prediction at the moment. Right now, the AirCar is a non-flying prototype and Milner is looking for a manufacturer to assess production. In the meantime, the company does have another project in progress, the ElectriCar, which looks much like an AirCar sans wings because thats exactly what it is. As Milner explained, the qualities that make for a good airplane  light weight and slick aerodynamics  also benefit efficiency on the ground, and the ElectriCar needs only six horsepower to cruise at 60 miles per hour. Which is fortunate, since it has the same 40-horsepower motor as the AirCar. The plan is for the ElectriCar to have 100 miles of range on battery power alone, and then recharge itself with an onboard generator, sort of like a Chevy Volt minus the crashworthiness.  But honestly, its hard to get worked up about an electric car when its parked next to a flying car. Or a driving plane. ",2008-03-21T20:08:28+0000

But that was enough to win the night, because ABC attracted only 6.3 million viewers to its new 8 p.m. comedy, Miss Guided. Up against Lost at 9 p.m., NBCs Celebrity Apprentice earned a modest 8.6 million viewers. At 10, the networks Lipstick Jungle (7.2 million) delivered its best ratings since its debut in February, but still trailed ABCs Eli Stone (7.5 million). Despite the edge in total viewers, NBC finished third among adults 18 to 49 behind ABC and CBS, which led the night in that demographic with its coverage of the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament.

The series, which starred Skeet Ulrich and followed the events in a small Kansas town after nuclear attacks devastated cities across the United States, was first canceled in May 2007. A campaign by fans combined with data showing that the show was being recorded and watched outside its broadcast time persuaded CBS to order a short second season. But the show has performed poorly since the new episodes began appearing last month. The most recent episode attracted fewer than six million viewers and a 1.9 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Without question, there are passionate viewers watching this program; we simply wish there were more, Nina Tassler, the president of CBS Entertainment, said in a statement.

The Beach Boys were founded in 1961 by Carl, Dennis and Brian Wilson, above; Mr. Love, their cousin; and a friend, Mr. Jardine. Dennis Wilson died in 1983, and Carl Wilson died in 1998. Mr. Love had sued Mr. Jardine, claiming Mr. Jardine improperly used versions of the name while fronting his own band. A federal judge ruled in 2000 that Mr. Jardine was engaging in trademark infringement for touring under names including Beach Boys Family & Friends, and that Mr. Love, a co-founder and one of the original lead singers, was sole licensee of the name. A federal appeals court upheld that ruling in 2003. Mr. Love and Carl Wilsons estate sued Mr. Jardine again in 2004 for $2.2 million in legal fees spent in the original litigation against him. It was that case, set for trial in April, that was settled this week.

us,After Frida,"Inverted Utopias  the blockbuster exhibition that, in the summer of 2004, filled much of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston with Latin American art  startled viewers as much with its omissions as with its contents. Where were the Social Realist tableaus of Diego Rivera, the flamboyant self-dramatizations of Frida Kahlo, the Surrealist visions of Wifredo Lam? Instead of those landmarks, Mari Carmen Ramrez, the museums curator of Latin American art, beamed a spotlight on the less-familiar alleyways of the South American avant-garde, especially the artists working in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela during the quarter-centuries on either side of the end of the Second World War. Visitors to the museum gazed on striated panels that seemed to move when a spectator moved, made by the kinetic artists Jess Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Dez in Venezuela; the sinuously calligraphic drawings and vehemently left-wing sculptures of the Argentine Lon Ferrari; the mysterious steel-wire hangings, like sun-warped or moth-eaten Bauhaus grids, by Gertrude Goldschmidt, a wartime German refugee to Venezuela who was known professionally as Gego; and the many-faceted work of the Rio de Janeiro artists Hlio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, close colleagues whose protominimalist and precociously interactive work in the 60s (like his capes to be danced in and her hinged sculptures to be reconfigured at will) exert a powerful influence today. And those are the famous ones: about a third of the artists in Inverted Utopias were rarely, if ever, exhibited in the United States before. We wanted to introduce these new values into North America, since they had been overlooked, Ramrez, who is 52, said recently. My objection to Frida Kahlo is the phenomenon of Frida Kahlo and the way it obscures Latin American art. She was a woman with an exceptional capacity to present her own suffering through an amazing and rather unique style. But she didnt have many followers. You cant use her as an emblem for an entire continent. Its absurd. Then she flashed a mischievous, gap-toothed grin. And of course, she wasnt such a great painter either.",2008-03-23T04:00:00+0000

But he was stuck, just the same. His brain was sending an electrical pulse saying walk, but as the signal streaked from his cerebellum and down his spinal cord, it snagged on scar tissue where the myelin layer insulating his nerve fibers had broken down.

No. The demands of virtue are also a problem for Prince, the canine narrator of Haigs curiously affecting take on Henry, which tells the story of a loyal Labradors efforts to hold his human family together. If only he follows the pact of his breed, Prince tells himself, he can save these people from themselves  from all their lies and tensions and betrayals and injustices. His friend Falstaff, a chubby mixed-breed he meets in the park, begs to differ. Duty schmooty, he bays (or however fictional dogs utter their dialogue) when faced with Princes insistence on duty over all. Dark, comic and quite brilliantly adult, Haigs thinking animals never stray into the sickly sweet zone.

The 240 guests, including the French prime minister, sat down at long banquet tables while the cooks worked out of a makeshift kitchen. Dishes were served family-style from large bowls and platters; the entre, veal shin on the bone, arrived with a knife sticking out of it. The chichi Parisians had to carve it themselves. They went mad for it, Arnold recalls. And so did the artist. Since then, Arnold & Henderson has gone on to produce other dinners for Kiefer in London, the most recent in a Soho parking garage.

Whether the speech helped or hurt him remains to be seen.

The monsters name bulged in thick red letters atop the panel: Superduperman. My good-guy stomach rolled. Everything stretched and went slantwise; a parallel universe yawed open, like jaws, and threatened to suck me inside.

Mussina gave up one run and three hits in seven innings while Igawa struckout eight in four scoreless innings.It wasnt bad, Mussina said. Ten oclock in the morning.

Under the title Jammin With the Beatles and Friends, Star Club, Hamburg, 1962, the eight tracks are said to include Paul McCartney singing Hank Williamss Lovesick Blues and Mr. McCartney and John Lennon singing Ask Me Why.

The adversaries are the makers of a Weinstein Company drama and a Martin Scorsese documentary. Marleys family, including his son Ziggy Marley, executive producer of the Scorsese film, has refused to license any of his music for the Weinstein film, even though Marleys widow, Rita Marley, is its executive producer. The Scorsese documentary is being produced by Tuff Gong Pictures, owned by the Marley family, and Steven Bings Shangri-La, which has licensed Marley songs. The family members say they believe the Weinstein dramas release date, expected to be late 2009, would conflict with the planned opening of their documentary, February 2010. (Marley was born on Feb. 6, 1945; he died in 1981.) Chris Blackwell, president of Blue Mountain Music, publisher of Marleys music, said he expected an agreement soon under which Weinstein would take a stake in the documentary and agree to postpone its drama.",2008-03-24T04:00:00+0000

us,'The Finder',"Three girls in a car at night, on their way to the beach in Brooklyn. Two are Mexican, about nineteen or twenty, young and pretty  like a lot of Mexican girls you see in New York City. Straight black hair, soft faces, a sweet-eyed optimism not yet destroyed by labor. Dressed in identical blue service uniforms with corpserve patches on the breast, they are nestled in a Toyota two-door subcompact as it flies along the Belt Parkway. The rattling, uninsured car is fifteen years old, carries expired Georgia plates, and has a market value of $125. In New York City you can always buy a car like this and you can always sell one. Who cares about the paperwork? That's for people who have big money to lose. These Mexican girls have no money. They work cleaning offices in Manhattan. Their day begins at seven p.m., so the hour now might be five in the morning, just before dawn. They go out afterward almost every night, a way of saying this work is not yet destroying us. A few minutes sitting in the car at the beach, then they'll swing back to the house on Avenue U, where they live with nine other people. Why drive? The subway, it don't go where we live. And the bus, it takes like forever. So the girls drive. Often they will smoke a little pot some boys gave them and giggle. Open the car's cracked sunroof, let the smoke drift upward. They are enjoying their freedom, their few hard-won dollars, their provisional American identities. They smoke, maybe drink some too, listen to the radio. Giggling and sweet, but tough  tougher than American girls. In the country illegally. Each carrying some kind of fake green card that she bought for $150. They've made the journey and are not yet beaten down, not yet burdened with children and husbands. They have cookouts and volleyball in one of the Mexican sections of Marine Park. And they have guys, when they feel like it, know what to do to make their men feel bien. Sex yet another kind of labor. Their mothers back home don't know  don't know a lot. Be careful! they beg, Nueva York is dangerous for girls like you. But that's wrong. Mexico is where girls get found in the desert, legs wide open, hair dragged with dirt, dead eyes already eaten out by bugs. New York City is big and safe and filled with rich, fat norteamericanos. Maybe the girls won't even marry Mexican men. Why should they? They talk about the office guys. The tall ones who look so good in a suit. You want to do him, girl, I know you do. No, no, es muy gordo, too fat. They laugh. They see a lot of powerful people leaving their offices at the end of the day. Men and women in business clothes. Nice haircuts, good watches. White ladies who think they's better than us. A corporate world so close they could reach out and touch it with their cherry-colored fingernails. Yet given the stratifications of American society, it is a world they are unlikely ever to know from within. They are like Nigerians in London, Turks in Paris, Koreans in Tokyo, Filipinos in Riyadh  outsiders in their new homelands. Their only advantages are their youth and willingness to suffer, but they will lose these advantages, as eventually they will lose everything, including their lives. Come to think of it, they will lose everything a lot sooner rather than later.",2008-03-24T08:30:00+0000

Lawyers for the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a community group, and for the government of Montgomery County, where the Barnes has been since its founding in the late 1920s, appeared before the judge,  Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans Court in Norristown, to request that he reopen the case. Judge Otts ruling in 2004 permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built in Merion. The judge said he considered the move the only viable alternative to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But the opponents contend that the collections financial troubles have been overstated and that new ways to raise the money to prevent a move have emerged. The county has offered, for example, to buy the foundations buildings and land for $50 million or more to keep the collection in place. But lawyers for the foundation and for the Pennsylvania attorney generals office argued before Judge Ott that the countys plan had come too late and that it could expose the foundation to extraordinary financial risk.",2008-03-25T04:00:00+0000

us,Krazy Glue Moments,"Why do some political missteps haunt their candidates forever, while others are easily put to rest? John Kerry saying he voted for the war funding before he voted against it, or Howard Dean screeching on a stage in Iowa, instantly becomes the stuff of political history, but when George W. Bush admits that he was once arrested for driving under the influence, it immediately fades into obscurity. Some politicians, as they used to say of Ronald Reagan, seem coated in Teflon, while others seem covered in Krazy Glue, unable to shake the stickiness of what seem like minor embarrassments.Heres a political postulate for you: whether or not a bad moment sticks to the candidate depends on how closely related it is to the core rationale of that candidate or his opponent. In other words, if your gaffe goes directly to the main argument you are trying to make about yourself with the electorate, or if it substantiates the most relevant thing that your rival would have us believe about you, then it has the potential to become a serious problem. If, on the other hand, you do something completely idiotic that is tangential to what voters most hope or fear about you, then you tend to get a pass. So Mr. Kerrys choice of wording hurt because it played into the main theme that the Republicans had chosen to discredit himthe notion that he wanted to have everything both ways. By contrast, Mr. Bushs brush with the law had nothing to do with the story he was telling about himself as a competent manager, nor did it underscore the central argument that Democrats were advancing about him (because, really, there wasnt one).

Many people, myself included as a college student in the seventies, were shocked that Wolfe, the liberating stylist and journalist, turned out to be very antipathetic to liberals and leftish intellectualism in all its forms, political, literary, artistic and architectural. Yes, in about 1970 he had written Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers, but they were brilliant pieces that didnt necessarily demonstrate a systematic conservatism. By the late 1980s, though, Wolfe had written and lectured often about his conservative views, he had been a guest of Reagans and Christopher Hitchens had called him the moth-eaten court jester for the White House. Wolfe would probably be amused that the academy was so insulated and so steeped in its own conventional wisdom that its members simply assumed that he agreed with them.",2008-03-28T23:14:54+0000

A law professor commissioned by Austrian Jews found that at least 11 of the foundations works, including some by Egon Schiele (whose Liegende Frau is above), Anton Romako and Albin Egger-Lienz, belonged to people persecuted by the Nazis and that the collector Rudolf Leopold certainly knew that they might have been looted. He knew, or he must have known, that these paintings belonged to people who were persecuted by the Nazis, said Georg Graf, the professor. Because of that knowledge, he must have been aware of the possibility that these were stolen goods. Mr. Leopold, in an interview with Die Presse, disputed the allegation. In my eyes, the pictures were acquired lawfully, he said. The Austrian culture minister, Claudia Schmied, said at a news conference this week that she expected the foundation to approve an independent examination of its collection. ... The National Gallery in London said its painting Cupid Complaining to Venus, by the German artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, was once part of Hitlers private collection and may have been looted during World War II, The Washington Post reported. A researcher, Birgit Schwartz, spotted the painting  showing Cupid complaining to Venus that he has been stung by bees after stealing honey  in a photograph of Hitlers private gallery contained in an album at the Library of Congress in Washington and brought it to the attention of the National Gallery. The museum has been unable to account for the paintings ownership or whereabouts from 1909, when it was sold at auction in Berlin, to 1945, when an American war correspondent took it from a warehouse of art guarded by American troops in southern Germany, a National Gallery spokesman said. The gallery bought the painting in 1963 from E & A Silbermann, a New York art dealer; that company, no longer in business, said the work had been purchased from family descendants of the 1909 buyer. But in December 2004, the National Gallery spokesman said, the museum received an e-mail message from Jay Hartwell of Hawaii, who said that his mother, Patricia Lochridge Hartwell, had owned the painting from 1945 until she sold it to E & A Silbermann in 1963. Ms. Hartwell, who died in 1998 at 82, had been a reporter during the war, and she took the painting from the warehouse and returned with it to New York, where it hung, her son recalled, in their home.",2008-03-29T04:00:00+0000

A 2,500-year-old krater attributed to the Greek master Euphronios will go back to Italy in two years under the agreement Ms. White reached with the Italian Culture Ministry. In a statement issued on Friday by both sides, Ms. White said that her collection had been purchased at public auction from dealers whom she and her husband, Leon Levy, who died in 2003, had believed to be reputable. She said she had nonetheless concluded, based on Italian government evidence, that their export from Italy was questionable. The Italian government has never accused Ms. White or Mr. Levy of any wrongdoing, and the joint statement said that Ms. White had shown great sensitivity and taken the initiative voluntarily to offer to return 10 items.

Dont Be So Sure (March 9):Ive noticed some other, more subtle forms of bias  both in The New York Times and in other news sources  that I dont quite understand.For example, when Senator Barack Obama wins a state he is expected to, like Wyoming, the victory seems to be played down. But when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wins a state she was expected to, like Ohio, it is heralded as a major alteration of the nominations dynamic.I can see this story line being developed for Pennsylvania, which is being framed as the crucial contest, but one that Mrs. Clinton begins with great strength.If the rules as set up by the Democratic National Committee are to choose a candidate by the total delegate count, and Mr. Obama has essentially a total that cannot be surpassed through regular state primaries and caucuses, I wonder why news coverage continues to treat the race as essentially even, and worse, that Senator Clinton somehow is gaining the upper hand.There are not always two equal sides to a story. In the case of the Democratic contest, it seems that the media are willing to engage in this subtle bias to continue the competitive narrative.Marc SchlossbergEugene, Ore., March 10, 2008",2008-03-29T15:52:54+0000

This is part of the huge challenge facing truth commissions, bodies entrusted (as was, for example, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission) with helping broken societies to achieve nothing less than individual healing, communal atonement and, of course, our old friend closure. In his new novel, the Irish writer David Park invents a truth commission dealing with the aftermath of Northern Irelands Troubles. Its an ambitious premise thats almost intolerably weighty; but with guile and wonderful imaginative sympathy, Park stays afloat on the most treacherous of thematic currents: the inhumanity of violence, the vulnerability of the individual before history, truths inextricability from power, the elusive nature of redemption.

So its no surprise that Della Valle is obsessed with globes. I have been a collector for about 50 years, he says. All my friends give them to me as presents. He found this one at Florian Papp, a small antiques shop on Manhattans Upper East Side; its become a favorite and now has pride of place in his office. I think I like them so much because I miss traveling for my soul rather than business, he says. Id love to stay for a long time in a small place where the food is fantastic and there are no phones. Della Valle hopes to hit the road soon, renting a motor home with his son and driving across America, making stops at places like Yellowstone National Park; Jackson Hole, Wyo.; and Palm Springs, Calif. After that, he might head off the beaten path. Maybe Ill just spin the globe, put my finger on it and go wherever it lands. Thats the dream. ARMAND LIMNANDER ",2008-03-30T04:00:00+0000

The difference with Davis  part of what makes her, I think, the greatest actress of the American cinema  was, she didnt need it. You could tell what she was thinking and feeling from across the room, even a very large one like the ballroom she swoops into, wearing a red dress, in William Wylers Jezebel (1938), scandalizing the haut monde of 1852 New Orleans; unmarried young women like her character, Julie Marsden, are expected to wear white. But Julie wants to make an impression, and she does; and as she takes a turn on the dance floor with her stiff-backed escort, you can see, although most of the sequence is long shots, her growing awareness that she has made a terrible mistake, that she has gone, for once, too far.

When Svobodas uncle Don, who had served as an M.P. at a prison in postwar Japan, died, he left behind a mystery. In taped reminiscences, he had talked about wide-scale executions of American prisoners. The prison was getting overcrowded, he had said, and a captain said he was going to have to start executing the prisoners, the ones in the death cells. Or Don may have accidentally killed a prisoner; he never mentioned the death on tape, but his brother believes it happened. After the Abu Ghraib scandal in 2004, he suffered from depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. How post is post? Svoboda asks the Harvard psychohistorian Robert Jay Lifton. Its certainly not fixed in time, he says. Sixty years? Its been documented. Throughout the book, Svoboda, a poet and fiction writer, seems self-absorbed, describing a weight-lifting class (I curl a bicep) and domestic scenes. Yet Black Glasses Like Clark Kent is suspenseful, and contains a message about war that makes it worthwhile. She interviews people here and in Japan, but never determines whether her uncle knew firsthand about war crimes or imagined them. It almost doesnt matter: his depression was debilitating; he tried antidepressants and electroshock. The thing that sustained him was talking into the tape recorder, describing his nightmare. When he was done, he killed himself, another casualty of war. ",2008-03-30T04:00:00+0000

Submarines had little way of knowing which Japanese transport ships were carrying prisoners of war. In any case, the U.S. Navy adopted a ruthless view, Max Hastings writes. Destruction of the enemy must take priority over any attempt to safeguard P.O.W. lives. As a result, some 10,000 Allied prisoners were doomed (including more than twice as many Americans as have perished in Iraq). And if the Americans didnt kill the P.O.W.s, then the Japanese did. Aboard the tramp steamer Shinyo Maru, the Japanese guard commander told the prisoners that if the ship was attacked, he would slaughter them all. As promised, when it was torpedoed in September 1944, the Japanese guards machine-gunned the prisoners trying to abandon ship. About 20 men escaped into the sea and were rescued by another Japanese ship. When their identities were learned, they were executed.",2008-03-30T04:00:00+0000

Las Pozas is near the village of Xilitla, a four-hour drive southwest of the nearest sizable airport, in Tampico, and seven hours north of Mexico City. Despite its remoteness (or, perhaps, because of it), the garden has long had a certain cult devotion.

As a Rare, Rare Find points out, the basketball players nickname is King James.
