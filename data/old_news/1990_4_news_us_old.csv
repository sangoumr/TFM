us,  Colombia's Elections Are A Study in 'Violentology',"THE man on the telephone took credit for murdering one presidential candidate, but his message was addressed to a second, Cesar Gaviria. The leader in Colombia's four-way race for president, Mr. Gaviria advocates the toughest line against cocaine traffickers. ''He can walk around with 100 bodyguards,'' the voice snarled into the spinning reels of a radio station tape recorder. ''But tell his security people to try to find a bulletproof vest for his head - because that is where we are going to hit him. Understand?'' Accustomed to the Colombian drug mafia's twisted logic, many people here understood: Traffickers had killed a minor party's candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa, to intimidate the man most likely to set drug policy in the 1990's for Colombia, the world's largest cocaine exporter.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,  Pitcher Gallery,"Despite the coffeetable contours of THE ART OF BASEBALL: The Great American Game in Painting, Sculpture, and Folk Art (Harmony Books, $40), the beverage of choice for its audience is more likely to be the fan's warm beer than the connoisseur's spritzer. Readers familiar with the histories of both American art and baseball will not find much that is new in Shelly Mehlman Dinhofer's text, but there is no dishonor in a book of pictures as carefully chosen, wide-ranging and handsomely reproduced as these. Here are diamond images, brilliantly faceted, in two dimensions: Thomas Eakins's 1875 watercolor of mustachioed ''Athletic boys, a Philadelphia club''; a play at the plate, in quintessential whirlwind John Marin style, drawn in the artist's last year (1953); a luminous George Luks oil, ''Boy With Baseball,'' circa 1925; Donald Sultan's enigmatic ''Baseball and Bat'' of 1981, a visual haiku in black and white. And in three dimensions: the liquid neoclassical poise of Douglas Tilden's pitcher (1888-89) and the megalithic stolidity of William Zorach's catcher (1940), together with their folk-art teammates from whirligigs and amusement arcades. Ms. Dinhofer, who curated the 1987 exhibition ''The Grand Game of Baseball and the Brooklyn Dodgers'' for the Museum of the Borough of Brooklyn, tends to root, root, root for the home team; expect a modest surfeit of Ebbets Field and Dodger lumber. Her visual analyses lack depth and connection - a number of tantalizing illustrations get no commentary at all - but her selections, discoveries and juxtapositions are rich. Here are portraits, fast and slow, to enact the archetypes and distill the game's fine old monosyllables: play ball; grand slam; strike three; safe at home.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

But the dialogue, the anecdotes, the wild flights of conversation still reverberate in my mind. This is what dining with D.V. was all about - food for the mind and senses. Not that the vittles weren't good. They were - soup, roast chicken, vegetables, some kind of bread pudding. Plain American fare. Everyone has a story of the surprising mix of guests, usually no more than six, often fewer, and even more often just a deux with Mrs. V. This recollection of Kenneth Jay Lane, the costume jeweler, is not at all unusual: ''Diana called one night. Obviously she had been expecting guests from Europe, who were not arriving in time. I was having dinner with my mother, just in from Detroit. Bring her, Mrs. Vreeland commanded. The evening progressed exactly as if the original guests had been there. D.V. talked on about Andy's new movie... about Candy Darling... reminiscences... the story of the first time she milked a zebra. The usual conversation. She never once said a word to me or looked in my direction. She spoke directly to mother. When we finally left, my mmother said: 'I don't know why you have never introduced me to your friend Mrs. Vreeland before. She is the most fascinating woman I've ever met.''' .",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT,"PLAYING FOR KEEPS: A History of Early Baseball. By Warren Goldstein. (Cornell University, $21.95.) Rich in delicious information, ''Playing for Keeps'' argues that the first years of ''base ball,'' as the sport was known in the 1850's and 60's, established patterns of double thinking that still govern the complaints and yearnings of fans. It may be no surprise that the good old days of fundamental play, team spirit, unselfishness, loyalty and love of the game were already being lamented by 1863. The more it changes the more it stays the same, and as with the New York Mutuals and the Brooklyn Excelsiors, so it shall be with the Orlando Whatevers. To that familiar principle Warren Goldstein, who teaches American studies at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, brings enchantingly detailed accounts of such matters as the 1867 betting scandal and the disruption brought on by players ''revolving'' - jumping from team to team - at about the same period. Irrationally, we still speak of the Red Sox or Yankees as ''clubs'' - meaning an emotional entity that is neither the group of players who rotate on and off the roster nor the corporation that operates the franchise. Mr. Goldstein takes us to the days of true clubs, when the first teams of Manhattan, Brooklyn and New Jersey were fraternal organizations of devoted amateurs. Even their uniforms and team names resembled those of volunteer fire companies. The author shows us how quickly the American desire to win converted the diamond into a workplace and the players into employees. Intense local rivalries led to the hiring of outside players. On that paradoxical model, other dichotomies emerge: we wish to see ballplayers as somehow boyish yet manly, enthusiastic yet ''professional.'' We idealize the sport for its own sake but make winning paramount, and we desire a sport that is a sophisticated city game yet pastoral, local yet national, paternalistic yet managerial, casual yet statistical. Thus our responses to modern strikes and lockouts and contracts reflect ambivalences already present in the ferocious ''fly rule'' debate of the 1860's. (Putting a batsman out by catching his hit on the first bounce was formerly a permitted but less ''manly'' alternative to the stylish, ''professional'' but uncodified catch on the fly.) ''Playing for Keeps'' tells this story with affection, though in the somewhat metallic style of the academic historian. Its calming long perspective should reassure lovers of the game - or business - as we approach new crises and apparent transformations.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT,"PROPHET OF THE SANDLOTS: Journeys With a Major League Scout. By Mark Winegardner. (Atlantic Monthly, $18.95.) It's easy to spot a superstar after he has become one. The trick is to see the makings of a Mike Schmidt or a Ferguson Jenkins in an unformed adolescent. The baseball scout Tony Lucadello had just such a gift, signing 49 future big leaguers in the course of his 50-year career with the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies. Schmidt and Jenkins were his most notable proteges on an honor roll that also included the pitcher Jim Brosnan, the 1970 American League batting champion Alex Johnson and the 1974 Cy Young Award-winning relief pitcher Mike Marshall. Mark Winegardner, the author of ''Elvis Presley Boulevard,'' accompanied Lucadello on his rounds through the Midwest's college and high school sandlots in what sadly turned out to be the veteran scout's last season. As they drove from game to game, Lucadello's chatter revealed a gentle but wily character who courted young players and their families with the utmost sincerity, but who also could crow with pleasure when he recalled how a dab of tear-inducing onion juice helped him persuade a reluctant Dick Drott to sign a pitching contract for $96,000 less than several other teams offered. Describing how he went about sighting talent, Lucadello could sound like a sage: ''It's easy to talk yourself out of a ball player, but the most important thing about scouting is being able to project what a player will be able to do.'' Mr. Winegardner's engaging portrait of a scout's life is at its best when he simply allows Lucadello to talk - his voice is so distinctive that the author's travelogue and personal asides cannot help suffering by comparison. But the author's assessment of the Phillies' decision to cut the team's - and Lucadello's - already tight player development budget a few months before the scout's death in May 1989 is sadly on the mark: ''Good plan, fellows. Enjoy your stay in the cellar.''",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

This is a genial, well-researched barroom argument - or, rather, discussion - about hitting versus pitching, old-timers versus new(er)-timers. The ''Two Spectacular Seasons'' in question are 1930, the best hitters' year in major league history, and 1968, when pitchers like Bob Gibson, Don Drysdale and Juan Marichal forced baseball to make drastic changes (such as lowering the pitcher's mound) to keep the .300 hitter from going the way of the dodo. William B. Mead, the author of ''The Official New York Yankees Hater's Handbook,'' does not allow the stars of 1930 to get away with misty-eyed accounts of why their game was superior. He also does not haul out sheets of mystical new statistics to explain the ascendancy of pitching in the late 60's. Rather, ''Two Spectacular Seasons'' tosses all the arguments, numbers and theories into one fascinating jumble, then sorts them out chronologically so the reader can follow, one subtle step at a time, the progression from 1930, when nine major league clubs hit .300 or better, to 1968, when only six hitters topped .300 (Carl Yastrzemski's American League-leading .301 in 1968 - the lowest championship average ever - was two points lower than the National League average of 1930). Conversely, the great Lefty Grove's 2.54 earned run average in 1930 would have left him in the wake of such trivia-book fodder as Detroit's John Hiller (2.30) and Baltimore's Jim Hardin (2.51) in 1968. Fans looking for the one big reason for the decline in hitting can pick from: the increasing number of huge, better-conditioned athletes who can throw over 90 miles per hour; the growing sophistication in the use of bullpens; the increase in lower visibility (for hitters) in night games; coast-to-coast travel; the replacement of hitters' parks with streamlined pitchers' parks such as those in Los Angeles and Houston - as Satchel Paige used to say, you pays your money and you makes your choice.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,  Where the Real Nations Are in the Center of Europe,"AS Communism recedes, longstanding ethnic rivalries remain to haunt Eastern Europe. The region is dotted with minorities, from the tiny population of Sorbs, a Slavic people, in East Germany to the Turks who make up 10 percent of the population of Bulgaria. Old hostilities are still being played out, like the rivalry of Hungarians and Romanians for ownership of Transylvania. In some cases, however, efforts are being made to heal old wounds, as President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia recently tried to do with conciliatory statements about the expulsion after World War II of 3.25 million ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland. Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have never been homogeneous nations at all; rather, they are combinations of distinct groups trying to share the same country. In Czechoslovakia, ethnic differences were played down during the four decades of cold war, but in Bulgaria and Romania the rigid Communist regimes suppressed ethnic minorities as official policy. Now, with the lid lifted in Eastern Europe, the ancient divisions are being given free expression and have become more evident than at any time since World War II. The re-emergence poses a challenge for the post-Communist republics: Can they accommodate the rivalries, keep the peace and build democracy?",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

William Curran, the author of ''Mitts,'' gives us a detailed and lively history of baseball in the 1920's, with chapters on Babe Ruth, Rogers Hornsby, John J. McGraw, Ty Cobb, the Chicago Cubs and the 1927 Yankees' ''Murderers' Row.'' His focus is the ''batting revolution'' that, he argues, transformed the ''scientific'' game of the 1910's into the power game of the 20's. Previously, teams struggled to score a run at a time as batters choked up on the bat to gain enough control to push the ball over the infielders' heads. In the power game, batters were encouraged to swing from the heels and, to quote one of Mr. Curran's colorful but somewhat misplaced metaphors, ''runs scored by the half dozen and base hits showered the still-new steel-and-concrete ball parks like cherry blossoms in a high wind.'' Batting averages rose an average of 40 points from 1918 to 1925. More remarkable was the increase in home runs. In 1917, Babe Ruth tied for the league lead in home runs with nine; the league record was 16. In 1919, Ruth hit 29 homers in 130 games; in 1920, he hit 54. The only losers were the pitchers, whose collective earned run average ballooned from 2.68 in 1917 to 4.33 in 1925. The hitting revolution was abetted by new rules that restricted and then prohibited trick pitches like the spitter. The so-called rabbit ball, which is usually identified as a primary cause of the hitter's ascendancy, had nothing to do it; Mr. Curran takes a full chapter to dispute angrily the theory that the owners imported a ''live'' ball to increase home run production. Mr. Curran writes well, but not well enough to hold the interest of the general reader. However, for those who thrive on stories, statistics and descriptions of past batting heroes, pennant races and World Series, ''Big Sticks'' may prove irresistible.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT,"NOW PITCHING BOB FELLER. By Bob Feller with Bill Gilbert. (Birch Lane/Carol Publishing, $18.95.) Freckle-faced boys in short pants routinely came up after games to ask Bob Feller, ''What's it like to be a real baseball player?'' Mr. Feller, now 71 years old and still a spring training coach for the Cleveland Indians and a player in old-timers' games, answers for all baseball buffs. His earnest autobiography, ''Now Pitching Bob Feller,'' is full of immense respect for the game. The book, written with Bill Gilbert, who wrote ''The Duke of Flatbush'' with Duke Snider, compares past times with the present, and Mr. Feller dutifully sticks in thoughts on current salaries, free agency and artifical turf (none of which he much likes). But best are the descriptions, inning by inning, of his prowess and problems on the mound for the Indians, the team for which he pitched from 1936 through 1955, with four seasons lost while he served in the Navy during World War II. He first pitched in an exhibition game in 1936, at the age of 17, before he started shaving and before his senior year in high school in his native Van Meter, Iowa. In his debut, his fast pitch, often wild, so frightened Leo Durocher, the shortstop of the St. Louis Cardinals, that the batter bolted off the field after two called strikes. That fastball earned Mr. Feller the nickname ''Rapid Robert''; he pitched no-hitters in 1940, 1946 and 1951, led the league in wins for six seasons and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. But one dream was denied him: to win a World Series game. Poignancy permeates Mr. Feller's recollections of two games lost in the 1948 series, which the Indians took from the Boston Braves. He was benched in the 1954 series, which the New York Giants took in four straight games. ''I wanted to win a World Series game. . . . I've never been quite sure why [Cleveland manager Al] Lopez didn't use me in that series. . . . I've never asked him myself.'' Mr. Feller found consolation quickly. He planned to take his boys fishing the day after the series. ''What time do we leave tomorrow?'' one asked. ''At times like that,'' Mr. Feller concludes, ''a young son is a good thing for a man to have.''",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Dave Dravecky was young, popular, celebrated and at the height of his powers when life threw him a curveball he never could have imagined. Mr. Dravecky, then a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants, was diagnosed in the fall of 1988 as having a desmoid tumor in his left arm - his pitching arm. That discovery of cancer and his subsequent bouts with the disease are described in ''Comeback,'' the story of his recovery and his later agonizing decision to leave the game he loved. At the book's core is spirituality: Mr. Dravecky's belief in God sustained him through his travail. There is an inspirational tone to the book, as well as the wit and flavor common to baseball, when Mr. Dravecky gives anecdotes about teammates and managers and offers a few insider's tips about the sport. Mr. Dravecky is a gamer, as is evident in his description of his comeback victory over the Cincinnati Reds 10 months after cancer surgery. He also describes with candor and a quiet dignity his decision to retire last November. ''Comeback,'' written with Tim Stafford, a contributing editor of Christianity Today and Campus Life magazines, is not a book with the usual exploits and shenanigans - no ''Bull Durham'' here.

Too frail to travel from her home in Lyons to Paris for her trial, she was tried in absentia and received a six-month suspended sentence. Because she had been a friend of President Francois Mitterrand, she at first asserted that the charges were politically motivated when she was accused of supplying certain Parisian circles with cocaine, heroin and hashish. Miss Sagan began her meteoric career at 18 with the novel ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' which sold more than 500,000 copies in 1954, won the Prix des Critiques and became a worldwide success.

us,  TERRORIST ON THE MOUND,"''Any baseball is beautiful. . . . It is a perfect object for a man's hand,'' Roger Angell wrote. Don Drysdale, who pitched baseballs with fearsome efficiency for 14 years for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, would agree, judging by his autobiography, ONCE A BUM, ALWAYS A DODGER (St. Martin's, $18.95). Written with Bob Verdi, a Chicago Tribune columnist, the book starts in Brooklyn, full of wonder and anecdote from the rookie right-hander who arrived in 1956, the year after after Brooklyn won its only World Series and two years before the team's owner, Walter O'Malley, took it to the West Coast. The best of the book is Mr. Drysdale's description of how he played the game. Until Orel Hershiser broke it two years ago, Mr. Drysdale held the record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched (58Z in 1968); he still holds the National League record for hit batsmen, 154; he won 209 games (without a no-hitter), a career good enough to get him into the Hall of Fame. He tells how he threw spitballs for years to the consternation of sluggers like Ted Williams and Henry Aaron, and how he felt about his reputation as a terrorist on the mound, with the perfect object turned into a weapon. Once when an umpire warned him not to throw at a batter, he responded, ''If you fine me, I'll get a lawyer . . . and I'll sue the entire National League. How can you tell me what I was thinking, what my intent was?'' The brushback worked; there was no fine. ''I always believed that it was them or us, and nothing was going to stand in my way.'' An athlete who saw many bad and good bounces, Mr. Drysdale is always aware of luck. His career began when he was an infielder with an American Legion team in the early 1950's. A Dodger scout named Goldie Holt happened to show up at a game. The team's starting pitcher did not, so the author's father, the coach, told him to pitch. He won and Mr. Holt asked, ''You ever thought about pitching?'' ''No, not really,'' he said, but his ability to throw aspirins changed that.",1990-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Spira claimed that foundation funds were being misappropriated, among other assertions. When Mr. Spira requested more money, Mr. Steinbrenner called Federal authorities. Mr. Spira has been charged with extortion and threatening Mr. Steinbrenner and Mr. Winfield. An arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. The Yankees' owner has offered his own reasons for paying the money, saying he did it ''out of the goodness of my heart'' and to squelch embarrassing information about former Yankee employees.

And the low volumes made it harder for pundits to reach meaningful conclusions about gains and losses in various indexes. But a quick look at trading patterns over the past five quarters shows that the swoon is no cause for alarm. Indeed, the Big Board's 41 percent first-quarter volume decline - from a high of more than 222 million shares on March 16 to less than 132 million shares on Tuesday - was modest compared with the three-week periods prior to the end of the previous four quarters. The declines in the last 15 trading days of those quarters range from 44.6 percent at the end of September to 67.7 percent at the end of December. Analysts say the main reason for these declines is that before the quarter ends, major portfolio managers have usually achieved the desired mix in their portfolios.

Yes, if the writer is Roberta Israeloff and the book is ''In Confidence: Four Years of Therapy.'' Ms. Israeloff, the author of ''Coming to Terms,'' sought counseling to become a better parent for her newborn son. She soon realized that she faced a more crucial issue: in 30 years, she had virtually never asked herself what she wanted or needed. Her therapist specialized in treating adult children of alcoholics, and Ms. Israeloff exhibited several of their characteristic compulsions: to please others; to continue achieving, nonstop, as if by reflex; to control and orchestrate every situation; to keep rage, envy, anguish and other dangerous emotions submerged, venting them only as attacks against herself. Others have tried to document the path to a healthy psyche, especially in self-help recovery manuals. But jargon-laden treatises cannot match Ms. Israeloff's fresh descriptions and striking analogies. Perceptive about her own and other people's behavior, she uncloaks intense emotions and juxtaposes stories so that the reader enjoys new insights along with her. We come to know her spouse, son and parents well through scenes drawn in the present tense, then analyzed with her therapist a few pages later. Her changing thoughts and nightly dreams provide as much action as exterior events. Though the interplay of all these elements could have been chaotic, they make instead an exhilarating portrait of the therapeutic process as a way to discover life's abundance. We rejoice with the writer when, at the end, she dreams: ''I am in a shower, the water is coursing down over me, a fountain of life . . . I am doused with happiness.''",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

A layman's survival guide to our high-technology world is one of those things you don't know you're missing until you hold it in your hands. In fact, it is long overdue. More than one-third of the college students across three states polled by the University of Texas in 1988 said they believed in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, unidentified flying objects and the lost city of Atlantis. Richard P. Brennan, a long-time science writer, writes in ''Levitating Trains and Kamikaze Genes'' that people misinformed about science have little hope of coping with the increasingly rapid changes our future appears to hold. Mr. Brennan offers his book to provide ''what an otherwise educated person should know [about technology] and no more.'' As promised, the author distills basic information about the current state of research on space, biology, computers, the environment, energy, superconductivity, medicine, transportation and weaponry down to 262 pages of usually easy-to-read text. The book begins with a 50-question test of technological literacy. It then steps systematically through technologies, carefully explaining such facts as ''a light year is a measure of distance, not time,'' and ''it is a mistake to think of a computer as a thinking machine; it is not.'' Computers, Mr. Brennan assures us, do not think: they merely do what we tell them to do with incredible speed. From such simple facts, the author progresses to explaining more complex ideas, from how and why installing superinsulated windows in buildings throughout the United States could save tens of billions of dollars each year to a discussion of why advancing nuclear weapons technology is giving defense analysts fits. There are places where Mr. Brennan's simplified explanations are still not simple enough for the average reader, and one can think of some topics that just didn't make it into this book, but Mr. Brennan answers a lot of the questions you felt too foolish to ask. Knowing the answers is important to your future.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Nowhere is this more evident than in southern Italy, a place that lacks (for historical, social and climatic reasons) the rich villas and gardens of the country farther north, and while many people rightly consider that the coastline from Salerno to Sorrento offers some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, there are modest beauties to be found here beyond the dizzying series of cliff-hanging villages nestling in the shadow of Vesuvius beyond the Bay of Naples. The small hotel gardens one may visit, and the many private gardens visible behind the larger villas in Ravello, Amalfi, Positano, and on the island of Capri, while perhaps not worthy of major features in the guidebooks, contribute to an unexpected extent to the glories of this part of Italy.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

According Paul Calvert, the materials scientist who initiated the research, the composite, which is made of crystals grown inside an organic polymer, emits green light when activated by an infrared laser. The materials do not work by filtering the light. Instead, the atoms in the organic materials, made from amino acid and nitro groups, are made to vibrate when exposed to infrared laser light. This is called secondary harmonic generation. Some inorganic crystals also have these frequency doubling characteristics, but are more difficult to grow and become cloudy with age. The Sussex team hopes to produce materials that can be used in fiber-optic applications and eventually as switching devices in optical computers.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,How Love Came to Simone de Beauvoir,"During the winter of 1928, a harassed Simone de Beauvoir decided that she was ''confined to home and library'' like ''a rat on a treadmill'' and had to do something to break free of the demoralizing circumstances of her life. Everything seemed beyond her control. A daughter of the bourgeoisie, she had become increasingly rebellious in the past few years. Several decades in the future, she was to become a leading French intellectual, the author of ''The Second Sex'' and the woman who was generally credited with a decisive influence on this century's feminist movement. But now, as a 20-year-old university student, she chafed at the arbitrary rules and requirements of institutions, the capriciousness of people in authority and the whims of polite society, from which she found herself increasingly alienated. She felt powerless to change anything, and that in turn made her hopeless. Economic independence, and thus the kinds of freedom she valued, would come with her university degree, but that was almost four years hence, an eternity to the unhappy student. She decided that the only way off the treadmill was to shorten her program by one full year - an astonishing feat if she could do it, and almost unheard of in French universities at that time.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

The tin loudspeakers in subway stations, for example, that make the train announcements sound like somebody sawing a piece of sheet metal. You stand in the dismal dank of the subway, water dripping, rats scurrying across the tracks, and you listen for the distant screech of the C train, and 15 uneventful minutes pass, and a transit employee turns on the P.A. and says something you can't hear because it hurts too much - it does cast a shadow over one's loyalty to mass transit. It would be nice to know if he is advertising cheaper fares or announcing that the train is canceled for three weeks because a water main has burst in the Village, where water is piped through hollowed-out logs dating back to the Dutch. But a Minnesotan doesn't let these things ruin his day. A Minnesotan carries a good book along on the subway and uses the time to improve himself. The IND has been like a college to me, and some authors that never made sense to me when I lived in Minnesota, like Beckett and Kafka and Pynchon - the C train really helps you see what they're driving at.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

''Is it normal that I am the only Belgian who must act against his conscience on such things?'' Baudouin asked. ''Do all have the freedom of conscience except the King?'' It was the first time in this century that the constitutional monarchy had reached such an impasse. To get around it, the King agreed to allow the Cabinet to declare him ''unable to govern'' for a day. The Cabinet then assumed his powers and promulgated the law. The next day, the legislature trooped back to Brussels for a special session to vote the King back onto the throne. But not everybody was happy.

us,IN SHORT: SCIENCE BOOKS,"THE NATURE FAKERS: Wildlife, Science & Sentiment. By Ralph H. Lutts. (Fulcrum, $22.95.) Can a beaver bandage the stump of its own amputated leg? Could a fox ride on the back of a sheep in order to elude the hounds? In the March 1903 Atlantic Monthly, the naturalist John Burroughs harshly criticized the contemporary rash of nature books as being overly sentimental, inaccurate and written ''simply to satisfy a market created by an eager and uncritical public.'' William J. Long, the author of ''Our Dumb Animals,'' was Burroughs's most obvious target, and vigorously defended his losing position in the scientific and popular press. The controversy involved the country's top nature scientists before it was finally settled by Theodore Roosevelt in 1907, when the President gave his support to Burroughs. In ''The Nature Fakers,'' Ralph H. Lutts examines the controversy, its origins, participants and, most important, implications for the present. Even at the time, Mr. Lutts writes, ''Most people must have found the whole affair a bit strange - a bunch of grown men, prominent and respectable men at that, arguing over whether porcupines [can] roll down hill.'' He presents the controversy not merely as a question of accuracy or even as an argument over whether animals reason, but as part of a cultural transition in the relationship between man and beast. That conflict between science and sentiment where animals are concerned is still very much alive. For example, Mr. Lutts details and deplores the costly 1988 rescue of the ice-trapped gray whales. He is particularly critical of those who seek to control animal populations without death. In nature, he argues, it is the animal population, not the particular (or particularly cute) individual specimens that are important: death is nature's way of keeping animal populations healthy. The issues, both past and present, are fascinating and have broad implications both for public policy and for the emotional attachments people often feel for animals. Because of its detailed and academic orientation, however, only the most dedicated general reader will benefit from ''The Nature Fakers.''",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: SCIENCE BOOKS,"CURRENTS OF DEATH: Power Lines, Computer Terminals, and the Attempt to Cover Up Their Threat to Your Health. By Paul Brodeur. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) The thesis of ''Currents of Death'' is that electrical technology is filled with hidden dangers for human health: power lines induce cancer; electric blankets cause miscarriages; computer terminals are slowly making us blind. Moreover, it says a conspiracy between the Government and the electric industry is keeping this kind of information from the public, while a small group of heretics and whistle-blowers are struggling to reveal the truth. Alas for doom peddlers, the thesis is unsubstantiated. Paul Brodeur is a longtime staff writer for The New Yorker who has chronicled many alleged technical perils, including microwaves in ''The Zapping of America.'' He knows how to pour on the facts. What he neglects to mention here is that virtually all experts say no proof exists that electromagnetic fields pose a risk to human health. He ignores the fact that the human life span has nearly doubled since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the increase being most rapid with the rise of electricity. He points a damning finger at computer screens but says nothing of consequence about television sets. He passes over the possibility that not all industry experts automatically betray the principle of scientific objectivity. As with many alarmist tracts, this one contains a smidgen of substance. Some experts suggest that accumulating evidence no longer allows categorical assertions that electromagnetic fields pose no risk for living things, while carefully adding that the implications for public health remain unclear. Mr. Brodeur would have it black and white. He says power lines, electric blankets and video display terminals should be considered guilty until proven innocent. This turns logic on its head. Alarming claims need large amounts of evidence. A person asserting the earthly presence of space aliens needs to have very convincing proof before being taken seriously. So too, Mr. Brodeur's thesis should be handled with extreme care unless, at some future time, a far more substantial accumulation of facts begins to argue otherwise.",1990-04-08T05:00:00+0000

A similar study conducted in 1945 yielded about 25,000 different words. The children's vocabulary has changed as well as decreased. Comparing the 5,000 most frequently used words in the recent sample and the most frequent 5,000 words in the 1945 sample, 1,758 words are found on one list and not the other.

Spring lamb and whole baby lamb are available now through October. Many cookbooks recommend cooking lamb to 140 degrees and say it will be rare. It won't; it will be medium. For rare or medium-rare lamb, the meat-thermometer reading should be 125 degrees. But keep in mind that there is a chance that not all potentially harmful organisms will be killed at less than 140 degrees. Lamb is well done at 160 degrees, and whole baby lamb should be well done or it will be tough.

us,  FICTION,"THE PHANTOM BLOOPER. By Gustav Hasford. (Bantam, $17.95.) In this sequel to Gustav Hasford's first novel, ''The Short-Timers'' (which Stanley Kubrick turned into the film, ''Full Metal Jacket''), James (Joker) Davis is still in Vietnam. Only this time, instead of plying his trade as combat correspondent, he is patrolling the boonies with the Vietcong. The title of Mr. Hasford's well-crafted novel refers to a Caucasian, thought to be an American, who appeared in actual press reports of the period and was believed by many soldiers to be the leader of a Vietcong guerrilla force. To Joker and his fellow Marines, this Phantom Blooper is a symbol, a near mythic force. ''He is,'' according to Joker, ''the dark spirit of our collective bad consciences made real and dangerous.'' In the first section of the book, set in the days when the Marines are preparing to vacate Khe Sanh, Mr. Hasford effectively renders the chaos of battle, the disintegration of authority, the futility of taking part in a war that cannot and perhaps should not be won. During these final days, Joker is captured by the enemy. For a year, this Alabama farm boy lives among the Vietcong, a prisoner intent on escape from captors who plan to use him as a propaganda tool against the Yankee imperialists. Before long, though, he begins to identify with his former enemies in their struggle against the invader. ''If the federal government of the United States died,'' he explains, ''I'd dance on its grave. I've joined the side of people against the side of governments. I've gone back to the land.'' In the final section of ''The Phantom Blooper,'' Joker, after being rescued in battle, tries desperately to come to grips with his Vietnam experiences. He is discharged from the Marines and re-enters civilian life. Here Mr. Hasford occasionally falters, slipping into maudlin philosophizing. But this is a minor lapse, one that is more than made up for by his strength in vividly portraying the day-to-day life of the Vietcong villagers, thereby giving us something we've rarely seen before: an empathetic view of a heretofore faceless enemy.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

We had long talks about work and love, as people do nowadays, and he startled me by announcing that intimate love had become a paramount value of his. He explained that years ago in pursuit of tenure at a famous university he had ignored the needs of his first marriage and then, when he didn't get the job, saw that he had put real life on hold while he fulfilled the deadly requirements of work. I listened but failed to respond sympathetically. I said work was real life; his problem was that academic success did not necessarily equate with real work. We provoked one another. He said worshipfully that intimacy was everything. I said recklessly that I could do without. Then we both stared. It wasn't what was being said that astonished, it was who was saying what.

WHAT THE TRAVELLER SAW (Viking, $30) is a collection of photographs, most of which Mr. Newby took during those 50 years, and a collection of essays. Each is a gem. He takes us on a trip around Cape Horn on a four-masted bark with wonderful action photographs of sailors; to Italy, where he was once a prisoner of war and later went back and married the young woman whose family helped harbor him when he escaped; to India, where he photographed the inside of the Taj Mahal Hotel; to Turkey (Istanbul is his favorite city); to England, where he photographed McCaig's Folly, a strange edifice that is a copy of the Colosseum in Rome in comparatively midget form; to Africa and Bali; and to China, where in 1973 he photographed cyclists wearing masks in below-freezing weather to protect themselves against Peking throat, a condition brought on by winds from Siberia. There are 21 essays in the book, and the black-and-white photographs that accompany them are striking. Mr. Newby feels that worthwhile photographs are not familiar tourist shots, but those that feature real people going about their work and worship. The essays and captions are entertaining, informative and witty and make one wish for more - in particular, they make one want to re-read Mr. Newby's other books, such as ''A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush,'' ''A Book of Traveller's Tales'' and ''Love and War in the Apennines.''",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

In addition to his official duties, he apparently found time to work on behalf of all manner of lobbyists, coal companies and others whose business could benefit from the intercession of the state's chief executive. Federal investigations of Mr. Moore go back to the early 1970's, but it wasn't until last week that the authorities were able to wrap up a case against him. Mr. Moore was indicted on and agreed to plead guilty to a raft of charges including extortion, mail and tax fraud and obstruction of justice. In one case, he helped a coal company get a refund of more than $2 million from the state's black lung fund and pocketed about 25 percent of it. He has admitted evading taxes on his extracurricular income. Mr. Moore said that while some would greet his indictment with ''great joy,'' others would be saddened. The latter referred to friends and family members but may well include some of his former associates. As part of his plea bargain, Mr. Moore has agreed to help in prosecuting other corruption cases.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,  NONFICTION,"SPARKY! By Sparky Anderson with Dan Ewald. (Prentice Hall, $18.95.) George (Sparky) Anderson has managed in the major leagues since 1970. He is the only manager to win more than 800 games with two different teams and to win a World Series in both leagues. Mr. Anderson also suffered a physical and emotional breakdown in May 1989, which he says was brought on by the daily stress of managing in the big leagues. This episode and his subsequent recovery are candidly discussed by Mr. Anderson, the manager of the Detroit Tigers, and his collaborator, Dan Ewald, the Tigers' public relations director, in ''Sparky!'' The book, however, is not merely a chronicle of a man's self-discovery and return to health; it is a fine baseball book filled with anecdotes and insights. Mr. Anderson's style is as direct and down-to-earth as a hard, clean slide into second. He writes of Pete Rose's gambling problems: ''He competed in everything. . . . That's why it doesn't surprise me that he did wager on football and basketball games.'' On managing: ''The problem comes up when managers try to show people they're smarter than everyone else.'' Mr. Anderson calls his former power-hitting, base-stealing second baseman Joe Morgan ''the greatest all around offensive player I ever managed.'' Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals is labeled ''Harry Houdini with a glove.'' Mr. Anderson calls baseball a ''make-believe world'' and adds: ''The guy carrying the lunchbox, taking the bus to work so that he can feed a houseful of kids - he's in the real world. The wife going to work after sending the kids to school - she's in the real world.'' ''Sparky!'' gives us not only a vivid portrait of baseball's most successful manager but also a refreshing view of a guy who has his head screwed on right.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Diane Lord, one of the guides on our river-rafting tour, had prepared a chocolate cake from a package mix she had brought along to celebrate the birthday of one of the tour participants. She pulled the cake out of the Dutch oven and passed it on to me. I started easily enough by joining the layers with the contents of a jar of strawberry jam. Then my troubles began. After heating together a quart of cream and a pound of bittersweet chocolate for a ganache to frost the cake, I was unable to get the mixture to harden enough in the extreme heat - even though I cooled it over ice - so that it was spreadable. We ended up serving the unfrosted cake in wedges with spoonfuls of ganache ''sauce'' on top and alongside.

Forty-five years has not allowed even one generation to pass since that nightmare.

Kennedy Airport in New York from overseas will soon lose the luxury of the citizen bypass, where those with valid passports were able to scoot past Immigration Service officers and submit their passports to the Customs officer who verifies their declaration and clears their luggage. The bypass, which has already been phased out at the seven or eight other United States airports where it was used through much of the 80's, was a big time-saver. When we came home through Kennedy in March - we carried our luggage aboard - we walked straight through, barely pausing to present our declaration cards.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

In his latest book, the Swiss novelist Daniel Odier has departed from his recent series of new-wave thrillers featuring Serge Gorodish and his naive companion, Alba - a kind of Nick and Nora Charles with a dark sensibility. Ably translated by Lanie Goodman, ''Cannibal Kiss'' looks at what happens when a writer finishes the last sentence of a novel and one of his creations steps off the pages and into real life. In a book as surreal and elusive as the images of a fun-house mirror, Mr. Odier takes liberties with magical realism. Both the writer and the reader accompany the character - a young woman named Bird - in her travels from Florida to Chicago, from sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles to the subways of New York. We follow Bird through a world of drugs, music and late nights, encountering characters whose implausibility is second only to their ultimate insignificance. Under the pseudonym Delacorta, Mr. Odier has written several novels, including ''Diva,'' which was made into a film in 1981. In ''Diva,'' the motivating force was a hunt for the sounds of recorded tapes. In ''Cannibal Kiss,'' the mystery aspires to be grander and more ephemeral: a woman searching for an identity. Set adrift from her creator, Bird wanders in an odyssey that, Mr. Odier would have us believe, symbolizes our own. The novel attempts a pop-spiritual association by ascribing to Bird a passion for the music and life style of the jazz great Charlie Parker. But it is unconvincing. Bird's travels seem to have no real direction; her observations ring only with hollow profundity.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

For 25 years Michael Levine was a foot soldier in the war against drugs - an undercover agent, until his retirement in 1989, for the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. As he sees it, drug dealers were not his only enemy, merely the ones who carried weapons and threatened bodily harm. At times far more vexing to him were, as he terms them, ''the suits,'' those bureaucrats entrusted with guiding this country's battle against controlled substances. As a result of constant run-ins with his bosses, Mr. Levine was definitely not a happy warrior. Fighting drug dealers was fine, even exhilarating, but fighting the suits was another story. In fact, it was downright frustrating and demoralizing - so much so that Mr. Levine chose to write a book, ''Deep Cover,'' detailing how and why, in his opinion, we are losing the war. According to Mr. Levine, the answer is the petty jealousies, rivalries and sheer ineptitude within not only the D.E.A. but also its rival, the United States Customs Service. Toss in some interference by the Central Intelligence Agency and you have what appears to be utter confusion. Using as an example a recent case that potentially could have bagged high-level drug operators from Bolivia, Panama and Mexico, Mr. Levine carefully and skillfully sets out to prove his point. From his description, it seems the Three Stooges could have done a better job of bringing the conspirators down. The problem implicit in a book like this is that the reader gets only a single point of view. One can only wonder what defense, if any, the suits might offer. Nevertheless, Mr. Levine has woven a fascinating, exciting and sometimes horrifyingly comic tale of an investigation that in the end, despite lofty possibilities, had startlingly little effect on the flow of drugs into this country.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,  THE HAPPY SLUMLORD,"MEN UNDER WATER. By Ralph Lombreglia (Doubleday, $17.95.) This powerful first collection of stories is mostly about young men on the cutting edge of failure. Bright, sensitive and reasonable, Ralph Lombreglia's affecting protagonists hurt profoundly as they are forced, time and again, into making barbarous contracts with a mad and maddening world. Their love lives are always tentative, often explicitly on trial (in ''Monarchs,'' the narrator and his friend June are on ''relationship probation''). Work, if more colorful, is equally problematic, as the minds of employers grow more eccentric and impenetrable by the moment. A vague notion of escape hovers constantly about these narratives (in ''Goodyear,'' a famous blimp becomes a seductive, horizon-filling image of simply floating away). Yet in the end it is not escape that provides release, but a kind of inexplicable, stunning illumination that shines suddenly on life and transforms it forever in a welling, irrational joy. Such an epiphany is central in ''Monarchs,'' where human troubles are subsumed into the spectacle of infinite clouds of butterflies, and also in ''Purification,'' a beautifully wrought story in which a young painter is informed by his father-in-law - an unlikely source for such a remark - that his paintings are about a kind of glory. Yet the most intractable and best-realized material is left for the title story. Gunther, an obese and whining slumlord, dreams of writing blockbuster film scripts; his young handyman, who thought he was hired to fix toilets, is eventually beguiled into helping Gunther on his dubious road to fame. The young man is in continual despair, Gunther is implacably vulgar and stupid, yet in the last scene the two are underwater in Gunther's pool, happily sharing the mouthpiece from a single scuba tank. Communion, ''Men Under Water'' seems to say, is not always a meeting of hearts and minds; it can be as simple as floating, or breathing the same air.",1990-04-15T05:00:00+0000

What goes on in the park is the same as what goes on in the city, in terms of specific incidents as well as the class aspect. It's just that the park gets a bad rap.'' At first glance, ''Central Park,'' to be shown tomorrow night at 8 on PBS stations, seems something of a departure for Mr. Wiseman; the three-hour film is in color and contains many pastoral scenes, as well as shots of protesters and the homeless. Mr. Wiseman, an acclaimed practitioner of cinema verite with 24 films and a MacArthur fellowship to his credit, has a reputation for focusing on facets of the American scene - usually institutions - seldom examined cinematically. His first production, the controversial 1968 documentary ''Titicut Follies,'' was about the criminally insane; his most recent film, last year's ''Near Death,'' was a six-and-a-half-hour study of the terminally ill.

This trade takes place largely within the same industry, even within the same company, between a parent and an affiliate. Partly because of this trade, Mexico has relaxed restrictions on foreign direct investment..

Born to unwed teen-agers from families all too familiar with poverty and prison, Jimmy became the recipient of state compensation that may amount to a quarter-million dollars. He also became the object of a custody contest between his paternal grandfather, a 37-year-old parolee, and his maternal grandmother, a 35-year-old welfare mother. Each accused the other of being an unfit parent. It was settled last week with Jimmy the apparent winner. Alameda County Court Judge Roderic Duncan awarded custody to Arthur and Tonia Lewis, distant cousins of the baby's mother, who have a 5-year-old daughter and run a 50-acre hog farm near Chowchilla. Judge Duncan praised the grandparents for accepting the decision, saying, ''Everybody realized that their own personal wishes are not the most important thing.''",1990-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Though some names in this book by Malcolm Forbes and Jeff Bloch, who also wrote ''They Went That-a-way,'' elicit sighs of ''Do we really want to hear about them again?'' - J. Paul Getty's grandson, for example - the lesser-knowns will pique your interest. There are few winners. Albert Einstein's younger son suffered a serious breakdown. A Vanderbilt son committed suicide, as did Gregory Peck's eldest son. Eugene O'Neill's boys, heavy drinkers, could have won Pulitzer Prizes for despair: Eugene Jr. slashed himself in a bathtub, stumbled down the stairs and died; Shane leaped to his death from a fourth-floor window. Daughters fared slightly better. Mostly they drifted into oblivion or went crazy, as did Victor Hugo's daughter Adele, and Ada Byron, the child of Lord Byron, who showed genius at mathematics only to end up as a compulsive gambler. Some children just take advantage of their je ne sais quois circumstances. Take Tommy Manville, the son of a millionaire industrialist, who married 13 times. Or the Hearst boys, who, given lucrative jobs in their father's empire, had almost nothing to do. And finally, to the reader's enormous relief, there are, to name a couple, those who triumphed: Jean Renoir the film maker, son of Pierre-Auguste, and Al Capone Jr., who ran a restaurant with his mother.

How was the 1871 lighthouse lifted from its original shoals on a treacherous reef?

us,  SOUTHERN EXPOSURE,"In the 1930's, years before the publication of her first short story and all the fame that would eventually surround her, Eudora Welty was a junior publicity agent for the Federal Works Progress Administration. She wandered through county after county of her native Mississippi, talking to people about their lives, jotting down observations and otherwise taking official and unofficial note of the Deep South, her own land and the land that would figure so predominantly in her fiction. Early on in the assignment, Ms. Welty, intending to reveal ''the life in front of me,'' equipped herself with an inexpensive Kodak camera and began taking her ''snapshots,'' those ''now or never'' moments snatched from time by the quick, observant eye of an instinctive photographer. This early, Depression-era work constitutes the bulk of PHOTOGRAPHS (University Press of Mississippi, $49.95). Whether it is a Baptist deacon, a blind weaver or a child dressed in her Sunday best, these are people who cannot be neatly summarized as victims, but are instead the unposed, unselfconscious, playing, working, struggling denizens of a particular time and place. In the introductory interview with Hunter Cole and Seetha Srinivasan of the University Press of Mississippi, Ms. Welty denies any conscious connection between the photographs and her fiction - though Reynolds Price, who wrote the foreword, detects in her short stories and novels the same ''instant indelible force'' that we hope to find in a photograph - and do, in Ms. Welty's. Above all, Ms. Welty stresses the importance of the subjects of her photographs. ''I wasn't trying to say anything about myself,'' she tells her interviewers. ''I was trying to say everything about them.''",1990-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Mark Twain is always a pleasure to read, even on loan, and this account of Twain's life and travels up to his marriage to Olivia Langdon in 1870, at the age of 34, makes free use of his letters and journals, his early newspaper writing and his later fictional retellings of his adventures to trace his development as a writer. Twain was a writer whose imagination built on his personal experiences, and ''Mark Twain: The Bachelor Years'' covers the experiences that made up the material for nearly all of his later books - his boyhood in Hannibal, Mo., his years on the Mississippi riverboats, his travels to the Nevada mining towns and to California, to Hawaii and to Europe and the Holy Land. Margaret Sanborn, who has written a two-volume biography of Robert E. Lee, is scrupulous in picking out discrepancies between Twain's version and the probable truth of an event - and in the process reveals much about Twain's methods of working. She picks out the likely first occasion when Sam Clemens signed himself ''with the pen name that was to become the most famous in American literature,'' and she is at her best describing the growth of Twain's fame as a journalist and a lecturer, first in the Far West and later in the East. Her book is too long by at least 50 pages, but it makes fascinating reading, and it succeeds on the simple principle that the best representation of Mark Twain is Twain himself.",1990-04-22T05:00:00+0000

In a move welcomed by the airline's unions, which accused Mr. Lorenzo of union-busting during the strike that precipitated Eastern's slide, the court appointed Martin Shugrue as special trustee of Eastern. ''It's time to change the captain of Eastern's crew,'' said Judge Burton R.

us,  DAFT DIGNITY,"REBUILDING COVENTRY: A Tale of Two Cities. By Sue Townsend. (Grove Weidenfeld, $16.95.) Sue Townsend's brittle, brilliant farce begins when Coventry Dakin, a beautiful middle-aged British housewife, seizes an Action Man doll and brains a slobbering, philandering neighbor who is about to strangle his wife. The neighbor, a loathsome physical wreck, drops dead and Coventry takes off, leaving behind, in order of insignificance: pompous cops, sniping suburban gossips, a ''pettifogging collection of concrete and brick they called an estate,'' her numbed teen-age children and her whining, toadlike husband and his collection of inexplicably anorexic pet tortoises. Coventry's fate is to become another anonymous face among London's homeless. There Ms. Townsend, author of the popular novel ''The Adrian Mole Diaries,'' sends her innocent and slightly screwball heroine along a bent path through London's upper and lower crusts. In one incredible week, Coventry becomes a bag lady, a prostitute, a maidservant and an earnest guest at a society dinner party. As we may expect, the homeless she meets have their daft dignity, the young professionals are feckless snobs and the upper-class swells come off as bloated, bigoted oafs mouthing Thatcherite platitudes. The book's title suggests that Coventry's flight, as with the running rabbits in American suburban escape novels of the 1960's, will lead her to a renewed sense of self. This doesn't quite happen, and the short chapters, jarring shifts in points of view and sketchy plot details make ''Rebuilding Coventry'' more a series of hilarious comic moments than a cohesive novel. But the book remains great fun, thanks to Ms. Townsend's crisp, clever prose and her unabashed glee at wringing from her wacky characters the essence of their vileness: everyone in England is rotten through and through, except for Coventry - who, as she reminds us, is beautiful and a murderer - and her friend Dodo, a high-society refugee who joins in her escape.

A sportswriter covering the born-again Washington Senators for The Washington Tribune, she keeps a steno pad at the proper level, but often is confronted with the solid evidence that there's more to baseball than being primed to play. The story presented in ''Squeeze Play,'' a first novel by Jane Leavy, a former sportswriter for The Washington Post, does baseball mythology proud. The Senators, back after 18 years, are now owned by Jimy Boy Collins, a television evangelist who makes Jim Bakker look like a saint. His players have the usual problems. There's also wife swapping, videotaping, blackmailing, tobacco spitting, booze, drugs, four-letter words, five-letter words, people who don't understand six-letter words. Both on and off the field, most of these adolescent men have trouble getting to second base. In brief, unexpected bursts, the novel deals touchingly with the serious baseball dreams of Buck, the poor Southerner who lives only to play ball; Rump, the legendary but aging catcher; Joey Proud, A. B. Berkowitz's childhood Yankee hero, now broken down; and A.B. herself. But the overall effect is that of a surreal parody, with a baseball team and newsroom that Mel Brooks might have assembled, where nobody and no activity is life-size, and where sex is a metaphor for baseball: you gotta play hurt.",1990-04-22T05:00:00+0000

Underscoring the fervid renaissance is the recent opening of Robert De Niro and company's dream restaurant, TriBeCa Grill, which, for those who follow the stars, could rank second only to the Hayden Planetarium. Here is a selective tour of TriBeCa dining spots. TriBeCa Grill (375 Greenwich Street, at Franklin Street, 941-3900): Like Tuesday's space shuttle, this two-week-old celebrity-owned restaurant had many nagging delays, but when launch time finally arrived, it took off with a roar. It's no surprise, of course, when the owners include - in addition to Mr. De Niro - Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Mikhail Baryshnikov and others.

Bronxites, he said, are being cinematically mugged by this labyrinthine story of racial and ethnic bashing, dubious politics and judicial righteousness. Mr. Ferrer, who read the script, wanted a disclaimer attached to the movie ending that would tell an unsuspecting audience that what it just saw was total fiction and that the Bronx has many uplifting features (maybe superimposed over a shot of the zoo or the Hunts Point Market, he thought). For a brief while, Mr. Ferrer talked of leading a boycott against Warner Brothers, the maker of the film. The film company responded by offering a one-sentence disclaimer and $10,000 to a community charity. Mr. Ferrer, whose legal counsel first raised the idea of some sort of contribution, rejected the money, saying he's not for sale.

In addition, the Peabody offered Henze's early, angular ''Kammersonate'' (1948), Shostakovich's spiky Trio in E minor (Op. 67) and Schubert's leisurely Trio in B flat (D. 898).",1990-04-29T05:00:00+0000

Indeed, tales of wonder and the fantastic are integral to all world literatures, are as old as recorded human imaginative thought. But as far as most serious readers today are concerned, ever since the mid-19th century, when Victorian culture demoted it to children's stories, fantasy fiction in English is for kids.

Though both responses express sorrow, the cases are different. Gide's point was that Hugo, a forceful but not especially profound or original writer, was so wrapped in the apparel of literary fame that he dwarfed all other reputations, whereas the point about O'Neill and Williams is that our history of writing for the stage, writing seriously, is so thin and insubstantial compared to Europe as to make them our masters by default.",1990-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The franc has been helped by the country's relatively high interest rates and by comments at week's end by the head of Switzerland's central bank supporting a strong currency and a sustained fight against inflation. In the foreign exchange market, that means interest rates will be pushed higher if necessary. Meanwhile, the pound ran into some trouble in the middle of the week as the British trade deficit jumped in March to $:2.18 billion, from $:1.39 billion in February.

Bait-and-switch alert: Willie Mays is not a cult baseball player. Neither are Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Duke Snider, Ted Williams, Henry Aaron or Lou Gehrig, though all appear in ''Cult Baseball Players,'' an uneven collection of 60 hero-worshiping essays by writers of large and small repute. The title whets the appetite for an anthology flush with one-game wonders, flamboyant flameouts, assorted oddballs and box-score cameos; the subtitle backs off that promise, allowing the aforementioned Hall of Famers to horn in. In fact, the only one-game wonder in the book is one of the writers: Larry Colton, who pitched two innings for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1968. But yes, the expected eccentrics do make the lineup: blunderful Marv Throneberry, Dick (Dr. Strangeglove) Stuart, Mark (The Bird) Fidrych, the minor-league fireballer Steve Dalkowski, the backward baserunner Jimmy Piersall, the starlet-struck Bo Belinsky, the catcher turned World War II spy Moe Berg. The best profiles establish a personal connection between writer and subject. The Washington Post sportswriter Thomas Boswell enjoyed two unblemished encounters with his hero, Roy Sievers. The film director John Sayles tells why he adopted Dick Stuart as his soul mate in fielding futility. The actor John Lithgow says he ''first encountered the entire concept of 'biceps' in connection with Big Klu,'' the sleeveless Cincinnati slugger Ted Kluszewski. The book's editor, Danny Peary, the author of ''Cult Movies,'' waxes long-winded about his own idol, Vic Power, then appends a 22-page transcript of an interview he did with the slick-fielding first baseman. Mr. Power's comments on life as a black-skinned Puerto Rican big-leaguer in the 1950's make some of the best reading in the book. They will enlighten a generation of fans who never saw him play. They don't, however, make him a cult baseball player.",1990-04-29T05:00:00+0000
