us,"Glittering High Jewelry, Inspired by Tweed","The joy of inversion animated the work of Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, the eminent 20th-century couturier who never encountered a convention she didnt want to subvert. Gender, especially, fascinated her. Liberating women from corsetry  putting them in trouser suits, chemises, short skirts and sporty leisure wear  radically advanced the course of modern feminism while making Chanel an international icon. But reimagining the shape of womens clothing, and thus their silhouette in the world, was only one aspect of her revolutionary spirit: By purloining traditional mens wear fabrics, she entirely upended notions of women as decorative and pliant. Tweed, developed as a humble workingmans cloth in Scotland in the 1700s and adopted a century later by the duck-hunting English upper class, ranked among her favorite textiles. In the 1950s, she introduced the nubby skirt suit in Linton tweed, variations of which are still a signature style of the house that bears her name. Now, Chanel has developed a new 45-piece high jewelry collection that uses an interwoven articulation of precious metals and stones to evoke the earthiness of that material. With a cascade of white and yellow diamonds in an encyclopedic variety of cuts and sizes, these dangling earrings conjure the informal, unpretentious warp and weft that captured the designers renegade imagination so many years ago.",2020-12-02T15:00:06+0000

The wording was meant to be whimsical, suggesting the human-powered equivalent of what were then fairly novel computer search engines. (In English, the nuances are lost; no zombie inflection was intended.) A request would go out for wangmin (web citizens), or in this case the more intimate wangyou (web friends, internet users sharing a common passion or cause), to come together as a kind of ad hoc detective agency in order to ferret out information about objects and figures of interest. It was just an outlet for fandom. But soon attention turned toward supposed wrongdoers, those thought to exhibit moral deficiency, from a low-level government official spotted flashing a designer watch far above his pay grade, hinting at corruption, to, more horrifically, a woman in a crush video  a fringe genre of erotica that traffics in animal cruelty  wielding stilettos to stomp a kitten to death.

Who needed a ball-worthy diadem that sat in a velvet box for much of the year, or an unwieldy cocktail ring? And so along came convertible jewelry  a single piece that could be configured in multiple ways. The most famous of these was Van Cleef & Arpelss Zip necklace, with diamond teeth that could be zipped up to become a bracelet. The Surrealist design was suggested to the jeweler by Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, in 1938 after one of Simpsons favorite couturiers, Elsa Schiaparelli, began to use the newfangled fastener on her designs instead of buttons. Today, the Paris-based house continues to experiment with such chameleonic creations, most recently this massive articulated collar with a detachable pendant and brooch. Adorned with more than 60 large rubies and a veritable mine of white diamonds, the two roses, which can be worn together as a clip, were fashioned by a proprietary method in which stones are set almost invisibly in a sculpturelike armature. The monumental piece, whether pinned to a lapel or draped around the neck, may not be built for practicality this time around, but it surely illustrates the beauty of always remaining adaptable.",2020-12-03T15:00:07+0000

Westerners have never quite understood the reverence in Japan for fugu, alternately known in English as puffer fish, globefish or blowfish, of the family Tetraodontidae. A sluggish swimmer, fugu has stunted fins and often flat-lying spikes instead of scales, and when confronted by predators it compensates for its lack of speed by swallowing enough water to swell up until its spikes stand on end, so it looks like an angry armored balloon. Among those who think of fugu as merely a distant delicacy, knowledge rarely goes beyond the fishs infamous trait: In the most delicious species, the innards are suffused with the neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX). In high enough doses, this can shut down a diners nerve impulses and cause, within hours, nausea, paralysis and the stalling of the heart, which only knows to beat because our bodys electrical system tells it to.",2020-12-04T13:00:08+0000

He was very helpful to me and spent many evenings at my home, assisting me with chores in exchange for meals, and teaching me the ins and outs of life in the village. He never asked me for anything, but I would periodically buy him school supplies or clothing, as he was very poor and said he was motherless. At one point, I left him money to care for my dog while I was away on an extended trip, and when I returned, the dog was emaciated and had obviously been fed very little. D. had clearly spent the money on something else. Although I was very upset about the condition of my dog, I felt enough empathy for D.s impoverished circumstances that I didnt question him about it. After I left Cameroon, I lost touch with D. I felt guilty for abandoning him  guilt that haunted me for years.",2020-12-08T10:00:03+0000

Yes, it provides a historical account of his time in office and explicates the policy objectives of his administration, from health care to economic recovery to climate change. But the volume is also an introspective self-portrait, set down in the same fluent, fleet-footed prose that made his 1995 book Dreams From My Father such a haunting family memoir. And much like the way that earlier book turned the story of its authors coming-of-age into an expansive meditation on race and identity, so A Promised Land uses his improbable journey  from outsider to the White House and the first two years of his presidency  as a prism by which to explore some of the dynamics of change and renewal that have informed two and a half centuries of American history. It attests to Mr. Obamas own storytelling powers and to his belief that, in these divided times, storytelling and literature are more important than ever, adding that we need to explain to each other who we are and where were going.",2020-12-08T19:00:10+0000

For now, while the restaurant waits for gas for cooking, its more generally American and European. Though the chef, Kamal Hoyte, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, is from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and has never been to Slovenia, the owner, Dean ONeill, an experienced restaurateur and restaurant designer, has had business interests there since 2003. The two have been working together on this project for more than a year. Mr. ONeill has also recruited Alma Rekic, a pastry chef from Slovenia, to consult on the mostly traditional sweets and her baked apple rolls, a Slovene item already on the menu. Mr. Hoytes food, described as Slovene-American, also reflects his background working in restaurants like Daniel: His Slovene fish stew will come with aioli, bouillabaisse-style. The restaurant is on two floors, and the lower level will have four private party areas to open in coming months. Street level is where the public dining is, in two rooms, one with exposed brick, a marble bar and assorted chandeliers.

The children are wailing in response to being hit  I can hear it all through the door, and the mother threatening to throw the children out. It happens multiple times a week, and I can hear all of this in my apartment down the hall.

us,An Examination of Caliphate,"Editors Note [Dec. 18, 2020]: In 2018, The Times released a 12-part narrative podcast series called Caliphate on the Islamic State terrorist group and its operations. While parts of the series involved a broad examination of the groups tactics and influence, multiple episodes were driven primarily by the confessional tale of a Canadian man of Pakistani origin who called himself Abu Huzayfah and claimed to have been a member of the Islamic State who had taken part in killings in Syria.During the course of reporting for the series, The Times discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies in Huzayfahs story. The Times took a number of steps, including seeking confirmation of details from intelligence officials in the United States, to find independent evidence of Huzayfahs story. The decision was made to proceed with the project but to include an episode, Chapter 6, devoted to exploring major discrepancies and highlighting the fact-checking process that sought to verify key elements of the narrative. In September  two and a half years after the podcast was released  the Canadian police arrested Huzayfah, whose real name is Shehroze Chaudhry, and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. Canadian officials say they believe that Mr. Chaudhrys account of supposed terrorist activity is completely fabricated. The hoax charge led The Times to investigate what Canadian officials had discovered, and to re-examine Mr. Chaudhrys account and the earlier efforts to determine its validity. This new examination found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the Caliphate podcast.As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of Caliphate that presented Mr. Chaudhrys claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.From the outset, Caliphate should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter. In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhrys claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individuals account. For example, reporters and editors could have vetted more thoroughly materials Mr. Chaudhry provided for evidence that he had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State, and pushed harder and earlier to determine what the authorities knew about him. It is also clear that elements of the original fact-checking process were not sufficiently rigorous: Times journalists were too credulous about the verification steps that were undertaken and dismissive of the lack of corroboration of essential aspects of Mr. Chaudhrys account. In the absence of firmer evidence, Caliphate should have been substantially revised to exclude the material related to Mr. Chaudhry. The podcast as a whole should not have been produced with Mr. Chaudhry as a central narrative character.A fuller description of what The Times has learned about Mr. Chaudhry was published on Dec. 18, 2020.

He had come from the N.F.L., where his most recent job was chief operating officer for the Minnesota Vikings. The first African-American commissioner of a major college conference, he had almost no experience in college sports. He was regarded as an outsider, a perception he shared. To help overcome that, Warren had intended to hold a town-hall meeting on each of the 14 Big Ten campuses during his first year as commissioner. The conference fielded 350 teams across 28 sports, and Warren planned to see every one of them in action. When the pandemic hit in early March, he had seen 105 teams play and hosted three town halls. He still barely knew the university presidents and chancellors, who hired him, or the athletic directors. Unlike his predecessor, Jim Delany, whose tenure as commissioner lasted three decades, Warren had no particular friends or allies among either group.

More recently, it has also fostered an influential community of beauty entrepreneurs. Since at least the early aughts, plant-based brands have thrived in the region, offering potent formulas derived from homegrown ingredients and produced in small batches with minimal preservatives.
