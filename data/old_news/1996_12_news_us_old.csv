us,French as a Weapon,"It's not the pain but the pleasure of exile -- the mutilating pleasure of cutting yourself off from everything closest to you -- that is the force behind SLANDER (University of Nebraska, paper, $14), a deceptively delicate novel by Linda Le. Like the author, the protagonist is a young Vietnamese writer who lives in France. She's estranged from her homeland but far from cozy in her adopted culture: ''French has become her only language, her tool, her weapon. The weapon she uses against her family, against the Country. Thanks to that weapon, she will always be alone. She's a meteque, a dirty foreigner, who writes in French.'' What could be the jumping-off point for a predictable analysis of post-colonial isolation becomes something more intimate as the protagonist probes the way she has willfully distanced herself from her family. Told by her vain, vapid mother that she's the product of an extramarital affair, she must decide which father to claim: the loving, beaten-down cuckold she grew up with or the unknown foreigner who came to Vietnam with the war and left behind an illegitimate child. Looking for some sort of direction, she contacts the one relative as alienated as she is: her uncle, packed off to an asylum by the family after an incestuous affair with his sister. The writer and the all-too-sane madman alternate their stories in self-conscious yet often lovely first-person narratives, translated here by Esther Allen. Reminiscent of Marguerite Duras's novel ''The Lover,'' Ms. Le's book offers proof that alienation, in the right hands, can be exquisite. Jennifer Howard",1996-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Once a week, he would note later, the master of this strange ship would stand before the assembled crew and their captives, holding a magical object in his hands. This talisman -- powerful and mysterious, whispered to be the repository of all knowledge and possessed of great ceremonial value -- revealed its secrets by speaking through the lips of the master. The slave marveled at the sublimity of this sorcery. After one such oracular display, he followed his master to the object's hiding place, and, stealthily and with the greatest trepidation, seized it in both hands. In his autobiography, published in 1770, he describes what happened next: ''When nobody saw me, I opened it, and put my ear down close upon it, in great hopes that it would say something to me; but I was sorry, and greatly disappointed, when I found that it would not speak.

Undertaken in a comfortable chair or even in bed, this paper gardening might seem idle compared with the work of weeding and mulching, but arguably it is as crucial to the success of next year's garden as any of the more sweaty seasonal pursuits.

The Swedish Modern style that emerged was unexpectedly dynamic.

First I checked my E-mail (messages from the kids, from a former colleague setting up a lunch date and from someone in an electronic discussion group I joined a few months ago, talking about the Battle of Trafalgar). Then I made a brisk electronic tour of the Uffizi and the Louvre. I read some valuable tips on lockpicking written by someone named Ted the Tool. I checked out the standings on the College Hockey home page. I browsed through the various on-line journals -- Slate, Salon, Hotwired, Suck, Feed and Swoon. I consulted a weather map customized for my neighborhood. I visited the poetry archive at the University of Toronto and ran a little search on the number of times the word ''thistle'' turns up in Byron. I window-shopped -- screen-shopped -- for a yacht in the Buzzards Bay classifieds. I stopped by the Kraft Interactive Kitchen and watched the dancing utensils for a while. I went to the Timothy Leary home page and read some of the gibberish posted there by fans of the doctor. I also went to the Internet cemetery, a place where people leave testimonials to their departed loved ones.

Ochs, publisher of The Times, began the fund after encountering a pauper, an immigrant, on Christmas night in 1911. Mr. Ochs believed that if readers of his newspaper knew how some of their neighbors lived, they would want to help. So the next year, a reporter searched the files of social service agencies to write about the city's 100 neediest cases. They included an Armenian immigrant who suffered from leprosy and the widow and four children of an Italian immigrant who had died of tuberculosis and who all suffered from the disease. The fund's 85th annual appeal, now under way, runs through Feb. 28. The Times pays all administrative expenses so donations can go directly to services for people who need them. And those who need them, officials of social service agencies say, are increasingly going to be immigrants affected by the new Federal welfare law, which sharply restricts Government assistance for noncitizens, among others. More than two million immigrants live in New York City today, and traditionally, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has noted, immigrants are among its hardest workers. ''Those tenement scenes of the Lower East Side were in fact a thriving and prosperous population; they were just packed in,'' he said. ''Emma Lazarus, wherever she is in heaven, has a lot to account for. They weren't the wretched refuse of anybody's shores. They come here to work.''

Men organize the public spaces; women feather the nest, presiding over the realm of domestic interiors. That Perriand, despite the buildings she has designed, should be known as a furniture designer while Philippe Starck and Ettore Sottsass, whose fame is based primarily on their furniture and household objects, should be known as architects is only one indication of the bias at work in a field that is notoriously and to this day overwhelmingly male.",1996-12-15T05:00:00+0000

The department says the Russians will never turn their plutonium into waste, but might be induced to use it in reactors if America did likewise. But some opponents say this could turn into yet another government subsidy for the American reactor industry. All agree, though, that getting the plutonium out of warheads is not enough, because that step is reversible and what is needed is a way to lock in deep reductions in nuclear arms. MATTHEW L.

us,How Firm a Foundation,"Smart and sprightly, the lavishly illustrated UNMENTIONABLES: A Brief History of Underwear (Simon & Schuster, $30) is a literary rummage through lingerie drawers past and present. Without flogging the idea to death, Elaine Benson, a Long Island gallery owner, and John Esten, an art director, suggest we are what we wear underneath it all. With men's undergarments, whether loincloths or Calvin Klein briefs, form has generally followed function. But women's undergarments have always involved altering the figure to suit the physical, and sometimes moral, ideals of the time. For example, tight lacing and corsets were popular when sexual restraint was most valued (hence the term ''straitlaced''). Conversely, women lost the stays and underwiring at about the same time they made strides forward socially and politically: after getting the vote in 1920 and the Pill in the 1960's, both flappers and feminists went braless. The authors' wide-ranging anthropological curiosity extends from Eden (where fig leaves were arguably the first underwear) to Southampton, L.I. (which still has laws demanding the portion of the breast below the areola be covered ''with fully opaque clothing'') to Hollywood, where in the 1950's James Dean's performance in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' and Marlon Brando's sweaty turn in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' revived the T-shirt industry. The text is also full of fascinating tidbits about the fripperies we take for granted. Take, for instance, the current convention of embroidering a tiny rosette on the cleavage of brassieres: it is a tribute to a fashion of 16th-century France, where women, whose hygiene habits were not the best, wore a scented pomander between their breasts. The biggest news flash in ''Unmentionables?'' We finally learn what Scotsmen wear underneath those kilts. The answer is not ''nothing.'' Judith Newman",1996-12-15T05:00:00+0000

But all the while, under 10-year-old regulations, the Army Corps of Engineers has been transferring land to private interests in small enough chunks to escape radar detection by most environmentalists and conservation-minded politicians.

He confessed to me, with an almost painful nervousness, that he hesitated to engage in any sort of publication for fear of losing the copyright; and when I assured him that I was acquiring one-time rights only, and that he would retain all further copyright, he explained to me the source of his anxiety. Early in his career he had allowed some of his speeches to be published, only to discover that in doing so he had unwittingly given away the rights to them. That such a thing was possible -- that he could be deprived of the possession of his own sentences -- surprised and wounded him.

us,Family Fables,"When the family members in CENTAUR OF THE NORTH (Arte Publico, paper, $11.95) talk about the past, they contradict one another -- and sometimes themselves. In one of the stories in Wendell Mayo's powerful first collection (most of which are set in Corpus Christi, Tex.), a mother offers her son conflicting accounts of the youth she may or may not have spent in Guatemala, Italy or China. And hers are the lies that bind. ''Unlike most self-respecting teen-agers,'' the son tells us, ''I stayed near my mother out of sheer curiosity. I needed a story I could believe.'' Ten years after his mother's death, he is still striving to find one. In the title story, relatives tell a teen-ager incompatible versions of the family's ''one great story.'' What is the truth of his grandfather's claim to have been part of the American Army contingent sent to Texas in 1916 to capture or kill Pancho Villa? If the boy's grandfather was in the Army, did he desert? Did he run from Villa? Join him? Did he ever even meet him? These questions lead, of course, to a much larger one: What provides the force of family mythology when the myths themselves are called into question? As the collection unfolds, it becomes clear that the power of these stories lies not in their accuracy but in the strength of their roots in a particular place. Evoking the visceral intensity of such memories, one narrator recalls having moved at age 10 to Chicago from ''the sweltering South, Corpus Christi, the Gulf, a place of sand and broken white seashells, of heat and a kind of bluish, fermented slowness of the body, a warmth within warmth that felt like family.''

us,HEART STOPPER,"Until recently, the logo for the House of Blues -- a nightclub chain with outlets in Cambridge, Mass., Los Angeles and New Orleans -- depicted a glowing, bleeding heart wrapped in thorns. But after the company announced it was hitting Chicago, local Catholics cried blasphemy. The symbol (near right) is a revered icon -- the Sacred Heart of Jesus -- and the Archdiocese of Chicago urged Isaac Tigrett, the nightclubs' founder, to scrap the image. Tigrett stalled at first, arguing that he strives to ''bring spirituality'' to mainstream culture, but the evidence for that was a bit thin.

Under the agreement negotiated before the State Supreme Court, Baruch agreed to redesign the top two floors so that they cast a smaller shadow on 330 Third Avenue, the co-op building 10 feet northwest of the complex. Baruch agreed to hold informational meetings, as needed, with the residents. Two single-room occupancy hotels have been cleared and construction is set to begin in February and finish in the autumn of 2000. ANTHONY RAMIREZ",1996-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Nick's Pix,"Perhaps December doesn't need another book about Santa Claus or his real-life counterpart, St. Nicholas, but two new small and arty books, for adults, satisfy a reader briefly. THE SECRET LIFE OF SANTA CLAUS (Chronicle, $17.95) is an illustrated alphabet book, originally published in France. ''A'' is for ''actually,'' and the example given is: ''Some of Santa's elves actually have a car. A real car.'' Next to ''actually'' is Gregoire Solotareff's painting of a hot-red 1940's-style automobile. The cuteness grates after the letter ''B,'' so don't feel bad if you want to skip the text and just derive pleasure from the artwork and its jaunty humor: the thickly painted, almost smeared images in primary colors (red, of course, being dominant) are so generous in feeling that you flip through the pages without a trace of humbuggery. THE LIFE OF SAINT NICHOLAS (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $18.95) is a whole other animal. The life is portrayed in comic-bookish parables drawn by R. O. Blechman in pen and ink, lightened with muted silk-screened color. The vignettes swirl around how Nicholas, born a Roman in A.D. 314, just as Christianity had gained legal tolerance, got to be so saintly. At a young age, Nicholas becomes aware that Roman life is grossly unfair. This dawning occurs as he is riding with his privileged parents in their caravan and he notices poor people. ''Who are all those people out there?'' he asks. ''Close the curtain, Nicholas!'' he is told. ''They look so wretched!'' he responds. Thereafter, he travels the Empire to work ''miracles.'' Nicholas eventually becomes a near-martyr (he saves himself from a bull) after he is thrown into an amphitheater for giving his overcoat away to someone in need. Mr. Solotareff's book is incidental but picturesque; Mr. Blechman's tries to be soul-searching. Like these books, Christmas in the 90's is an amalgam of both approaches.

Petesch's latest collection of stories, THE IMMIGRANT TRAIN (Swallow/Ohio University, cloth, $24.95; paper, $14.95), offers a sobering series of portraits of newcomers from Lunawicz, Poland, as they arrive in America in the early part of this century. Portraying an experience of unrelenting heartache and disappointment, Ms. Petesch presents the disparity between the opportunity her characters expect to find and the exploitation and poverty they actually encounter. In a representative story, ''The Beekeeper,'' a young man accustomed to farm life works 12-hour shifts in a Pittsburgh steel mill and lodges in an overcrowded tenement. For consolation, he spends his savings on a swarm of bees -- and is promptly rejected by his narrow-minded fiancee for, as she sees it, lavishing more care on his hive than on her. In ''The Orphan Train,'' a motherless boy leaves New York and goes to work for a family in Minnesota, harvesting vegetables and carting water to miners in the iron pits. His attempts to find his father, who had abandoned the family to head west, eventually come to naught. The most ambitious section of the book, the novella ''Pawel in America,'' depicts a politically persecuted doctor who emigrates with a forged passport and is snared by the authorities when he gives his countrymen medical attention. The stories in this volume are written with evocative, understated prose and contain memorable characters, yet the sameness of their conclusions suggests that the author has political as well as artistic objectives in mind. In ''The Immigrant Train,'' Ms. Petesch pays tribute to the millions who embarked on new lives here, believing, however incorrectly, that ''opportunity is everywhere in America.''

But in the biography ''Zelda,'' a very different picture emerges. Scott had an extreme dislike for his wife's writing.

us,Not a Thing to Wear,"Nick Kelsh declares that he sought to avoid sentimentality and ''the cult of the cute'' in his photographs of NAKED BABIES (Penguin Studio, $24.95). His intention is valid but the results wind up throwing the infant out with the bathwater in a wash of body parts. Shots of ears, rears, torsos, toes, nostrils and navels abound, objectifying the baby rather than celebrating its human spirit. Occasionally an image captures personality or an elusive moment, as in a photo of a baby boy in Zen-like contemplation of his penis or one blissfully absorbed in sucking his toes. However, most seem disconcertingly detached. In contrast, Anna Quindlen's text reflects wisely on the innocence of of babies. Whether suggesting that ''babies epitomize self before we screw it up'' or imagining birth from the infant's perspective as ''one moment floating in warm salty water. . . . only to wake suddenly in the Lincoln Tunnel at rush hour in a convertible,'' Ms. Quindlen writes with eloquent ease. Speaking as a mother -- she gives due credit to her three children, Quin, Christopher and Maria -- she asks: ''Who was it coined that old saw about God making them so cute so we will not kill them? It has particular resonance at 4 a.m.'' Leslie Chess Feller",1996-12-29T05:00:00+0000

The design of the spacesuit became a highly cooperative effort with Russ, NASA and the astronauts. We made many trips to B. F. Goodrich in Akron, where we had give-and-take sessions with Russ and worked hard to construct a suit that would allow maximum flexibility because the astronaut had to take full manual control of the spacecraft in emergencies. We decided to make a suit literally tailor-made to a fraction of an inch around every dimension of the body. Bending your elbow in a pressurized suit was extremely difficult unless the suit was tight enough to overcome the resistance. If the suit was several inches away from the skin, it would have been impossible to move. To keep us cool, Russ designed very thin long-john underwear with tiny coiled wires that would permit airflow around the whole body. He also designed airtight connections at the wrist and around the helmet, a special pressure zipper to prevent air leakage and little fingertip lights on the gloves of the suit for extra illumination during travel on the dark side of the earth. I remember that with all these special connections, it was quite a contortion to get into the suit, but it fit and it worked. When I went on my mission, I had full confidence that I was going *and* coming back. John Glenn",1996-12-29T05:00:00+0000

Wells cast his aliens as irremediably inimical to humans, a lead followed by the makers of the recent movies ''Independence Day'' and ''Mars Attacks!''

The cost of making sure that the atmosphere in the fuel tanks is not explosive would vary by airline. Some carriers could simply seal up their center tanks and use only the wing tanks.

us,Torture! Carnage! Elephants!,"Ross Leckie's first novel, HANNIBAL (Regnery, $19.95), is a lusty, full-throttle portrait of the great Carthaginian general, the scourge of the Romans in the third century B.C. and the man who made marching elephants famous. First glimpsed as an aged, scarred warrior, long defeated and awaiting capture by his enemies, Hannibal recounts his exploits as a brilliant military tactician and cold-blooded killer whose family was sworn to the destruction of Rome. Educated in Greek and Latin, he is also introduced early on to warfare and has few qualms about the savagery that goes with it. ''I have seen many crucifixions,'' he recalls somewhat wistfully. ''I have ordered many. But the first of all things is the best and the worst.'' The young Hannibal, sent to Spain to build a mercenary army to guard his country's trading routes, eventually defies the council of elders of Carthage and embarks on his daring march through Gaul and over the Alps into Italy, where his exhausted and depleted army hands the Romans several stunning -- and stunningly depicted -- defeats. Along the way, Hannibal marries Similce, the daughter of a Spanish tribal chief, whose rape and murder at the hands of Roman soldiers only increase his thirst for revenge. Mr. Leckie is least effective in explaining Hannibal's ultimate failure to capture Rome and most effective in describing the Carthaginian's revolutionary tactics. The writing in ''Hannibal'' is direct and unflinching, and even if the frequent scenes of torture and carnage threaten at times to turn the stomach, one is finally left with the powerful image of a lonely, haunted leader, stewing in his hatred and brooding obsessively about his actions: ''A battle is like lust. The frenzy passes. Consequence remains.'' Scott Veale",1996-12-29T05:00:00+0000
