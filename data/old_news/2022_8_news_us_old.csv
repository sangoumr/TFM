Charlie discovers this after he and his friends stumble upon an underground lair beneath his home; as in Spy Kids, the veteran parent soon finds need for junior backup, which the intrepid little kids are all too eager to provide.",2022-08-11T11:00:05+0000

us,The Artists Taking on Mass Incarceration,"WHEN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY artist Maria Gaspar was 12 years old, her teachers took her to jail. It was the early 1990s, in the era of Scared Straight programs aimed at curbing juvenile delinquency, and Gaspar and her classmates were deemed at risk, by virtue of where they lived  the West Side of Chicago  and who they were, many of them first-generation immigrants from Mexico. Back then, on any given day, Cook County Jail, located in the citys South Lawndale neighborhood, housed some 8,000 people, a third of them pretrial detainees unable to post bail, mostly men, Black and brown. Gaspar remembers her frightened teachers, all of them white, scurrying through tiered cellblocks; the inedible food served to them in the mess hall; the guards scolding the young visitors for crossing their legs and for not being clean. But her clearest memory is of the faces of those who gazed back at her from their confinement. I remember feeling like the guys behind bars looked like people down my block, she says. They just looked like people I knew. That stuck with me.",2022-08-11T13:00:22+0000

us,A Glossy Rainbow Fireplace From Luca Guadagnino,"Theres an elegant logic to the fact that Luca Guadagnino, the 51-year-old Italian director of films such as Call Me by Your Name, runs a design studio. After all, his movies are as much about atmosphere as they are character; to him, objects are also metaphors, whether a marble corridor that stands in for bourgeois restraint or a peach that represents the opposite. His most recent creation, a fireplace, was inspired by its function as the spiritual center of the home. Forgoing traditional materials such as stone and brick, he had Munichs famed Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory fabricate this vivid pastel-hued ceramic hearth, which can be made in different sizes and palettes (he has one in his own country home in the Piemonte region of Italy). The difference in working with this material versus, say, marble is that youre not chipping away to see what emerges  youre building from nothing, he says. To Guadagnino, the brash, glossy rainbow surfaces suggest a dancing flame, though the fireplace is built to withstand real heat. There may be a little crackling to the finish, he says, but I think thats beautiful. Its part of the story.

The more than 255-carat raspberry-shaped gem, which was made into a pendant with leaves of gold and green enamel, has a peripatetic history: After the 1574 death of its first known owner, Charles IX of France, his wife, Elisabeth, brought it back to her home in Austria. It was later looted by Sweden during the Thirty Years War and eventually given as a gift to Catherine the Great. But during an inventory of the Russian collection in 1922, the mineralogist Aleksandr Fersman made a shocking discovery: Caesars Ruby was, in fact, a rubellite tourmaline. While classified as semiprecious, such tourmalines, which derive their color from manganese, are actually rarer than rubies. By mixing deep scarlet rubies with tourmalines, which tend to come in shades of tender rose, in a pair of pink gold chandelier earrings, Bulgari, the 138-year-old Rome-based luxury brand, has created an explosion of shimmering coral reds that trace the curve of the neck. Caesars Ruby captured the worlds attention with its depth of hue; these earrings refract that legacy in an elegant cascade.

New inflation data on Wednesday showed the Consumer Price Index rising 8.5 percent in the year through July, a notable slowdown from June, when prices increased 9.1 percent. Falling prices for airfares, used cars, hotel rooms and gas drove the decline, with the national average for a gallon of gasoline descending sharply since earlier in the summer. But the inflation report is not the unqualified good news it may seem at first. A measure that strips out volatile food and fuel costs rose 5.9 percent, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remain strong. Still, the overall moderating pace is likely to be reassuring for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who will see Julys data as a step in the right direction. And its a win for President Biden, for whom high inflation is a political liability. What happens next, however, is uncertain: Last year, inflation sped up in the fall after cooling in the summer.",2022-08-14T11:00:06+0000

In 1981, he was taken to a hospital in Hawaii after his left lung collapsed while he was swimming. He underwent a voluntary stem-cell procedure in 2015, in an effort to repair his damaged lungs. Smoking has endangered his life, but it also, he thinks, saved it: He has often said that he would have died long ago had he not taken up weed and laid off drinking, which made him rowdy and self-destructive. Now, in his late 80s, he has reached the age where getting out of bed each morning can be construed as a feat of survival.

Sculptors are interested in how something works, how it moves, how it enters the discourse. As an example, she points to the work of two filmmakers: David Lynch, who once described a movie of his as a dream of dark and troubling things, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, about whom the critic Roger Ebert wrote, He had a certain contempt for the formulas of romance and heartbreak.
