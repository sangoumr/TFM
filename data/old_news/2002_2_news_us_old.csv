Of Manhattan, nee Sarah Dajch in Paris, France, died yesterday of cancer, surrounded by her family at her daughter's home in Los Angeles. Mrs. Tabori was an educator in the New York City Board of Education Auxiliary Services for High Schools, where she taught and developed programs for Frenchspeaking students that made it possible to acquire a high school diploma or equivalent in either English or their native French. Mrs. Tabori's efforts encouraged her students, many of whom were Haitian immigrants, to go on to higher education and become doctors, lawyers and teachers, while others pursued careers in health care, business and politics. A large number of her students became leading members of their communities and were then able to assist others in need thanks to the many opportunities that she helped make possible. As a young Jewish girl living in France during WW II Mrs. Tabori escaped the horrors of the Holocaust by hiding in small towns and villages while carrying false papers that identified her as non-Jewish. She immigrated with her family to the United States in 1957 and became an American citizen. Her wartime and immigration experiences helped her define a vision of America as a haven for all those who have suffered from oppression. She strongly believed that as an American, she should do all that she could to assist her students from Haiti who came here in search of safety from a repressive regime. Therefore, Mrs. Tabori went to great lengths to help as many Haitian immigrants as she could to acquire proper documentation, and even financial support, that would have otherwise been unattainable for those seeking admission to colleges and universities. She worked in schools in Brooklyn, the Lower East Side, and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where she was well known and admired. Services for Mrs. Tabori are being held today at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles. She is survived by her daughter, Rachel Tabori Myerson of Los Angeles, her son Michel Tabori of Santa Monica, her daughter Sylvie Tabori also of Los Angeles and her grandchildren Zoe Myerson and Zachary Tabori.",2002-02-01T05:00:00+0000

''Slurry,'' a piece for clarinet trio, puts breath behind the contemplative and quizzical mood of the other compositions.

Neither Edwards nor Fassel is surprised at the ascent of the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams. Neither coach is awed, either. The Jets and the Giants know these teams too well. The Jets played both, losing in a rout to the Rams and splitting their two games with the Patriots. The Giants led the Rams for most of the game in St. Louis, eventually losing by a point. The Giants also played the Patriots in the preseason after spending three days in New England competing in joint practices. Familiarity in this case has bred insight, because in interviews conducted with Edwards and Fassel, it was apparent that each coach felt confident he had the right scouting report. Edwards dissected the Patriots, his team's frequent divisional rival. Fassel broke down the Rams, a team the Giants have played in each of the past three seasons.

''It's just like coming home,'' she told Rita Valeri, one of the owners. And that's just how Rita and her husband, Romano, like their place on Raritan Avenue to be known. ''Homey, mom-and-pop type,'' said Mrs. Valeri of the restaurant they bought from her cousin, Penny Frandsen, 16 years ago. A peek behind the cash register at a bulletin board filled with photos of customers' children emphasizes the point. Unlike some other restaurants that open at 6 in the morning, Penny's stays open for lunch and dinner, till 7 p.m. (weekdays), serving 200 to 250 patrons each day at 15 tables and a seven-stool counter. Dinners include a variety of meat and chicken dishes, none much more than $10. ''A lot of the old and a bit of the new,'' is how Mrs. Valeri further describes Penny's. Included are wraps ($4.95 to $6.95), Greek salad, sweet-potato fries. Then there are at least 10 different kinds of homemade soups, plus fresh fruits bought daily from farm markets by Mr. Romano, who does all the cooking. Penny's -- serving breakfast all day -- sits in the middle of downtown, only minutes from the turnpike and Routes 1 and 18.

He is preparing for his fourth consecutive appearance in the Super Bowl. He wears Nikes, a pair of sagging nylon running pants, a white T-shirt and a baseball cap. He is surrounded by carpenters, electricians, designers, costumers, stylists, men perched at computer monitors and wearing headsets, men holding binders and wearing worried expressions, caterers, corporate executives, recipients of Academy and Tony Awards, a greasy-looking fellow in a tuxedo and ruffled shirt and 9 or 10 young women dressed as beauty queens. Buckley, 38, directs television commercials. This one, promoting Oxygen Media, owners of a cable channel aimed at female viewers, involves a lavish tongue-in-cheek reconstruction of three generations of beauty pageants. Hence Buckley's workplace -- a cavernous sound stage at Silvercup Studios -- is littered with artifacts that might belong in a pop-culture shrine: a green wall covered with a spray of vibrantly fake flowers; a corkscrew-shaped red velvet lounge chair; an enormous Pop Art cutout of the face of the Statue of Liberty.",2002-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The Nazi party began as a crusade for workers' rights organized by a Munich locksmith, Anton Drexler, in 1919, before Hitler took it over the following year. The Bolsheviks also emerged amid emancipating political upheaval and, like the Nazis, exploited the dream of social renewal. Once the Nazis and Bolsheviks were in power, the inventions of the Industrial Age became crucial to their crimes. As for Mao Zedong, his push for labor-intensive industrialization, through the establishment of utopian communes, led to the deaths of at least 20 million Chinese during the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1962.

''There's been a major resurgence of the retro-Breck Girl style,'' said Edward Tricomi of the Warren Tricomi Salon in Midtown. ''Customers want something more playful and free spirited than the usual stick-straight look.'' Steve Berg, a stylist at Pierre Michel Salon, agreed. ''The flat-ironed, dead-end look is tired,'' he said ''People are moving back to pretty, shiny hair with volume at the crown, curves around the face and a wave at the ends.'' Seen on Nicole Kidman (far right, top) and Kate Hudson (lower right) at the Golden Globe Awards last month, the style works best with a cut that's slightly curved in the back and has long layers in front. Mr. Berg recommends applying a light mousse, like John Frieda Quick Coif, to nearly dry hair and rolling the hair with hot curlers or a round metal brush and blow-dryer in six sections (two rolled away from the face at the crown, two rolled under in the back and on each side). After brushing the hair smooth, control flyaways with a dab of styling cream like Kiehl's Silk Groom. ''Be sure the rollers or brush are oversize,'' Mr. Berg said. ''Otherwise, you end up with curly wings, akin to Miss U.S.A., circa 1976.''",2002-02-03T05:00:00+0000

If you stand on the seventh tee, on the high ridge overlooking much of the course, you will see the sweep of this ancient linksland. If you look just left, beyond the course, you will see on top of Ben Bhraggie a monument to the first Duke of Sutherland, an infamous personage in the &quot;empty lands,&quot; as writer Tom Atkinson calls them in his book The Northern Highlands. The colossal statue of the duke &#151; contemptuously called &quot;the Mannie&quot; by people hereabouts &#151; commemorates a man who was at the forefront of the Highland Clearances in the early part of the nineteenth century. The Clearances emptied these high lands of some fifteen thousand people, most of them crofters, or tenant farmers, whose ancestors had lived here for generations. Sheep, it was argued by the duke and his minions, would prove far more profitable than people. ",2002-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Hit 'Em With a Lizard!,"You don't have to be a rock 'n' roll fan to find BASKET CASE (Knopf, $25.95), Carl Hiaasen's caper about murder in the music business a rollicking good time, but it helps. In laying out the tale of Jack Tagger, a maladjusted, middle-aged Florida obituary writer who stumbles across a hot news story in the supposed scuba-diving death of Jimmy Stoma, former lead singer for a band called Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, Hiaasen skewers both corporate media operations and the world of pop stardom. Anyone who's read a Rolling Stone interview or perused enough rock lyrics will admire his mocking sendups. (Stoma -- a seeming amalgam of Jimmy Buffett and Kurt Cobain -- titles his Grammy-winning album ''A Painful Burning Sensation.'') More mainstream crime enthusiasts will admire Tagger's dogged pursuit of what really happened to Jimmy, and relish a cast that includes a female cop who poses for Internet porn and Jimmy's Courtney Love-like widow. Hiaasen goes over the top in solving Tagger's personal quest for the death notice of the father he never knew, and errs in having Tagger repeatedly insist Elvis Presley died at the age of 46 instead of 42, something any self-respecting obit writer would know.

He easily envisions ''the look on the face of the beloved back home the first time she opened this absolutely austere box and found a colorful, exotic wonder world inside.'' Sailors didn't actually make most of the valentines. Barbadians did, using beach finds and sometimes incorporating clients' names and photographs. Loved ones rarely minded having a memento made by a stranger's hand, Mr. Fondas said, because they knew sailors were too busy trimming and furling sails to glue shells together.

An outcry has provoked the changing of a rule against displaying a statue of a former prime minister in the building until five years after his or her death. Such statues will now be allowed in provided their subjects have been out of office for at least 12 years. The decision means that the statue will not be temporarily placed in Grantham, Lady Thatcher's hometown, which had offered to take it. Nor will it go to Lake Havasu City, Ariz., a retirement community whose Republican residents had said they would be honored. Sarah Lyall (NYT)",2002-02-07T05:00:00+0000

When it came time to renovate the top half of their four-story Brooklyn brownstone, above left, they wanted to create a similarly lively backdrop for themselves. Their architect, Alden Maddry (Mr. Phillipps's cousin), created a colored light box on the top floor, above center and right. The walls, which enclose a bathroom, are made of two layers of acrylic panels, clear or amber inside and frosted outside. They are broken up by thinner panels of clear acrylic that hold images by John Rae, a New York photographer. The panels are removable, which means the couple, who have a daughter, Circe, 3, can change color, composition and artwork whenever they want. ''Just unscrew the panels, take them out and replace them,'' Mr. Maddry said. Most of the light box panels are 18 by 52 inches and cost $26 each at E & T Plastics in Long Island City, Queens. (Some Canal Street plastics shops also stock them.)

Mr. Denari presided over the school's difficult move last year from Marina del Rey to a former freight depot downtown. Mr. Moss, above right, a longtime professor at the school and a key player in the city's design renaissance (his office renovation in Culver City, is at above left), took over on Friday. He promises to reinstate SCI-Arc's ''tradition of nontradition'' and to move away from design driven by intellectual theory, which is perceived as an East Coast obsession. Indeed, deciding which coast has the hottest talent is the architecture world's favorite parlor game. On the East Coast, the focus is on the Princeton University School of Architecture, which has been searching since July for a new dean.

After all, Mahler being Mahler, there are ruminations about the afterlife in the two vocal movements and a finale that has a weighty, soul- searching quality that prefigures the finale of the Ninth. Even the work's opening bars - a stately theme for eight horns, sharply punctuated by strings, winds and percussion - can be heard as an ominous rumbling of dark things to come.

Sony's year-old PlayStation2 dominated the market, which received a strong lift in November from new consoles from Nintendo and Microsoft. After record sales of $6.9 billion in 1999, the game industry retrenched slightly in 2000, with revenue of $6.6 billion. But game makers sold 39 percent more consoles in 2001 than the previous year, and the higher prices of the three next-generation systems drove revenue up 120 percent. Sales of entertainment software, which included games for consoles and personal computers, rose 11 percent, to $6 billion. The NPD Group, formerly known as NPD Intelect, said the industry would have trouble beating the 2001 results because most of the sales growth came from the introduction of the new, more expensive consoles.

The 'all arrears' had been due, she knew, to something like the fever of elation she was feeling now: there was no question of his paying 'all' which by now must amount to so much money she no longer bothered to keep an account.

But it is plain to see that in the great game of survival every living thing must eat in order to replicate itself and so sustain the precarious grip of its species on its place in nature. What strong desires impel this behavior among the lesser sentient creatures we can only imagine. We may assume, however, that these other living things, unlike ourselves, rely upon instinct to moderate their hunger and lust, for unregulated desire means conflict and eventual extinction. But for us, when we encounter a pretty face or fowl, the moderating instinct is not nearly as dependable, if dependable at all. Hence our collective willingness, older than recorded time, to rely upon priests, magistrates and sacred texts to govern our appetites: a survival strategy embedded in our laws and rituals and known as civilization, a strategy that our fellow creatures, governed by instinct, can forgo.",2002-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Born in 1930 and raised in Brooklyn, Dick earned himself a place at Brooklyn Technical High School and graduated from Cornell University in 1953 with a degree in civil engineering. After a two-year tour as an Army engineer, Dick worked as a civil engineer. Finding engineering insufficiently challenging, Dick put himself through NYU's business school at night. Dick went on to become a management consultant and a partner in the New York accounting firm of Anchin, Block & Anchin. Dick married Goldy Meresman in 1956, and they moved to Garden City, New York, in 1957, where they raised three children, Robert, Susan, and Stephen. After Dick's retirement to Hilton Head Island in 1996, he became an avid, but not always successful golfer. After Goldy's death, Dick and Maxine Uttal fell in love and spent a happy year together.

In addition to book jackets, even Abbey's academic vita listed him as &quot;born in Home.&quot; And in his private diary as late as 1983, Abbey whimsically recalled &quot;the night of January 29th, 1927, in that lamp-lit room in the old farmhouse near Home, Pennsylvania, when I was born&quot; (308). In fact, that night at 10:30, weighing in at nine pounds, three ounces, Abbey was born in the hospital of the good-sized town of Indiana, Pennsylvania, with doctor and nurse in attendance, as recorded on his birth certificate and noted in the baby book that his mother kept.

Readers unfamiliar with the conspirators (celebrities of their day who long ago entered obscurity) will have to look elsewhere for background information. This fascinating book evokes the cultural climate -- the feverish idiom of the editorialists, the scramble among the fashionable for courtroom tickets -- that defined what the editors, James L. Swanson and Daniel R. Weinberg, suggest was a thoroughly commercialized and media-driven series of events. As Swanson and Weinberg make clear, it was all quintessentially American. People purchased the trial transcripts rushed into print by ambitious publishers, ordered commemorative trinkets by mail, hung paper flags and collected cards memorializing the slain president. Most notably, ''Lincoln's Assassins'' reproduces Alexander Gardner's striking photographs of the incarcerated defendants, which convey a sense of almost surreal immediacy. In the roll of a young conspirator's soiled lapel, or in his matted hair and perturbed brow, we see hints of how the assassination and its aftermath were lived by its participants, behind the screen of sensationalism. For a reader looking at the tense, shackled bodies of those who had trapped themselves at the core of a pivotal event, there's a sense of mundane moments that add up to history.

us,'A Life of Sir Francis Galton'," Francis Galton invented pedigree analysis to measure the heritability of human &quot;talent and character.&quot; This technique caught the imagination of eugenicists in the early twentieth century and is a fundamental tool of modern human genetics. One reason Galton set such store by this method was his own sterling pedigree (Table 1-1). His ancestors, the scientific and medically inclined Darwins, and the Galtons, a family of wealthy Quaker merchants, both hailed from the environs of Birmingham. Galton's cousin Charles Darwin inspired his investigations in human heredity while his father, Samuel Tertius Galton, endowed him with a substantial inheritance. This permitted him to roam without financial constraint through his various scientific pursuits. His father may also have sparked his lifelong interest in numbers and quantification. Francis Galton indeed had an enviable pedigree, so to understand the man one must know something of his family and especially his maternal grandfather Dr. Erasmus Darwin, the common familial link between Galton and Charles Darwin (Fig. 1-1).

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  COHEN, EMIL","COHEN-Emil. Died February 12, 2000 at age 88. With apologies to those who were unaware of his death two years ago in Lake Worth, Florida, we honor his memory and the way he celebrated life bringing mirth and good will to countless friends and audiences. As an entertainer in a golden era of Catskill Mountain performers he developed a special blend of home-spun stories topped off with the punch line in Yiddish. It helped, but you didn't have to be Jewish to get it. As the laughter was at its crest he would follow up with an English translation, but such was his delivery that even the occasional gentile couple from the farm belt could swear they got it the first time around. Because he appeared before hundreds of thousands of people in a career that spanned half a century, he was billed as America's Foremost American Jewish Humorist. Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1911 the son of Julius and Ida (Magidoff), he was raised in Wilmington, Delaware in a family that included his sister Rose (who survives) and his brothers Hym and Phil. After serving in the United States Air Force during World War II, he joined the staff at the Grossinger Pancoast Hotel in Florida where he honed his skills as a professional comedian. There, Paul Grossinger introduced him to Lillian Rothman. Elaine Grossinger Etess recalls that after what seemed (to Paul) an appropriate length of time, he asked Emil, ''And what are your intentions with Lillian?'' ''Honorable.'' They were married in 1950, and, as Emil was fond of saying, they soon produced two sons: ''One a doctor, the other a lawyer. The doctor is 6 and the lawyer is 3.'' This proved prescient. The older son, Jay, did become a doctor and the younger, David, a lawyer. His relationship with the Grossinger Hotel was felicitous. He and his family would stay at the resort, where he entertained at poolside. The guests were in Catskill heaven. Mornings with Lou Goldstein at Simon Sez, afternoons at the pool with Emil Cohen, evenings at the playhouse to see the likes of Milton Berle, Eddie Fisher, Zero Mostel, Joey Bishop, Alan King, Buddy Hackett. What could be better? The borscht was plentiful as Emil and the guests enjoyed a society of mutual admiration. He would criss-cross the country, with club dates from Seattle to Miami, from Portland to LA. But in summer, he would always come back to Grossingers' poolside, as if to recharge his batteries with love from his adoring family-not to mention the gefiltefish and nova and the brisket done just right. He lived to make people laugh. When he was not performing live, he made recordings, one of which (T'synagogues and T'centers) revealed where he spent a good deal of his time. He was, perhaps, best known for his hilarious translation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address into Yiddish, and his accounts of his Southern Bubbie who could speak no English. With his sweet tenor voice (for which he would credit his father, a cantor), Emil would move audiences with nostalgic renditions of traditional Yiddish tunes. Over the course of his career he raised tens of millions of dollars for UJA and Israel Bonds. Emil worked until about a year before his death. Even at 87, he made the rounds. But instead of flying to Montreal for a club date, he'd enliven a group of senior citizens at a nearby center. Never crude or the least bit off-color, his humor was gentle. As he grew older, he spent a great deal of time with his grandchildren (Jay's children Samantha, Zachary, and Joelle; David's children Alexandra, Danielle, and Scott). He taught them kindness and generosity, not by preaching it but by example. They loved him for it. He spoke ill of no one and never uttered an unkind thought. Perhaps because he never harbored one.

It should go without saying that his contribution is extraordinary and that his dogged pursuit of knowledge is heroic. However, I seriously doubt that this is what Divoky envisions as the legacy of his work: a human interest story suitable for a TV talk show. We're in serious trouble. The ramifications of his evidence are unfathomable. What we must do is act, and act now, to reduce the environmental impact we are having on this planet, not to mold Divoky and his message into a story ready-made for a Hollywood treatment.",2002-02-10T05:00:00+0000

But I must admit that my friend's son Donovan had the upper hand during our recent lunch at the Argyle Restaurant in Kearny. According to the Argyle's place mat, Kearny is the ''Scottish capital of the United States.'' Could Donovan tell you that? No, he can't read. So I will have to tell you that the walls of the cozy dining room are covered with Scottish artwork: bagpiper portraits, Edinburgh photos, maps and a scenic loch or two. And if for a moment you doubted the Argyle's authenticity: a fellow diner was wearing a kilt. The house specialty is fish and chips ($10.25 in the dining room, $8.22 for takeout). This is where Donovan truly upstaged me: His child's portion was nearly as large, included a small beverage and dessert, and cost a mere $4.50. What a treat that fish was, served piping hot in a crispy, flaky crust. The chips were decent French fries, though I expect chips to be thicker and wrapped in grease-stained newspaper, like in the 1981 Scottish film ''Gregory's Girl.'' Donovan, whose knowledge of cinema goes as far back as ''Toy Story 2,'' couldn't have cared less about the meal. He busied himself with Bob the Builder stickers. After the meal, we exited through the adjoining Piper's Cove Scottish gift shop. I said hello to the clerk, but she was preoccupied with Donovan's antics.

In between the two events, Ensler had appeared in a benefit performance of the play that made her famous, ''The Vagina Monologues,'' and now reverent fans are squeezing their way toward her in hopes of a brief audience: a crew-cut young man who says he has seen the light, an activist who's pitching a new shelter for drug-addicted women, a female executive who bonded with her daughter at the show.

Runge, of the National Highway Safety Administration, noted that this differed from non-Hispanic whites, for whom car accidents are the leading cause of death for children 4 and older.

The annual gain came despite lower fourth-quarter sales, which declined 2 percent from a year earlier but were better than expected because of price cuts as manufacturers tried to clear out old models. Palm held the top spot, with 39 percent of the global market -- three times the share of Handspring, ranked second -- but its share fell from 50 percent in 2000.

The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., lost $45 million, or 6 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 27, in contrast to a $157 million profit the year before. Excluding one-time items, Applied Materials earned 2 cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectation of a break-even quarter. For the first time in a year, new orders rose slightly over the previous quarter, and the company said it expected them to rise again this quarter. James C. Morgan, the chairman and chief executive, said he saw signs of a recovery, but not for at least several more quarters. ''It's still challenging out there,'' he said in an interview. ''We're scratching for every order.'' Job cuts and factory closings helped offset the decline in sales, which fell to $1 billion, from $2.36 billion a year earlier.

The company, which supplies teas to some high-end New York restaurants, makes three kinds. The chocolate in the black tea intensified the tea without overwhelming it. Another variety, Cocoa Loco, is a mixture of rooibos, a fruity South African herbal tea, with chocolate and vanilla bits. It had rich, spicy nuances. A third variety adds some mint to the rooibos. Interesting, but not, quite literally, my cup of tea. I was surprised Serendipitea does not make a green tea with chocolate, because to my palate strong green tea has almost chocolate overtones. ChocolaTea might be just the right Valentine's Day gift for the chocolate and tea lovers on your list.

BP said it increased oil and gas production for all of 2001 by 5.5 percent, in line with the company's own estimates and at a faster rate than its rivals Royal Dutch/ Shell and the Exxon Mobil Corporation. In response to lower oil prices, which have fallen as the world economy slows and the terror attacks in the United States have crimped demand, BP said it would eliminate 15 percent of the jobs in its chemicals unit and an unspecified number elsewhere.

Cars like the red-hot 2002 Thunderbird, above, reflect his desire to put ''a spin on automotive design that is less pragmatic and more fantasy-based,'' he said. He does not conceal his disapproval of brands that lack what he calls the ''emotional connection.'' Two evocative concept cars, as well as models, renderings and historical documents, are included in ''Autoemotive,'' an exhibition of Mr. Mays's work, which is on view through April 7 at Harvard's Gund Hall Gallery in Cambridge, Mass.

At 7 o'clock on Tuesday mornings, hungry patrons can be found lined up in front of New Johnny's restaurant on Route 27 in New Brunswick, across from the Coach Bus terminal, on the Somerset border. Tuesdays are ''dollar days'' when the establishment's biggest seller -- a hot dog with chili sauce and fried onions -- goes for a buck. In fact, a breakfast special of steak and egg and cheese is just $2.99, a pretty good bargain any day. The menu also includes breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches and hamburgers, buffalo wings, Philly-style steaks, fish and chips and mozzarella sticks for $1.50 to $3.50. The little restaurant has been serving up to 20 customers at a time for breakfast and lunch for 45 years, said Katherine Kourti, who with her husband, Dmitrios Gavalos, manages the place for his uncle, Lucas Barbatsis. Mr. Barbatsis and his wife, Theodora, have owned the place for about four years (adding the ''New'') and also run a Stewart's in Franklin Park. On any given day, according to Mrs. Barbatsis, New Johnny's fills 200 to 300 orders for patrons who include lawyers from New Brunswick and businesspeople from down the street, people like Phil Seagull, who works for a tire outlet and has been eating there for 20 years. ''Good food, clean and not expensive,'' he explained. Those franks, $1.65 when not on sale, are coveted by former customers. Mrs. Barbatsis said some visiting expatriates buy 20 or 30 or them, freeze them and take them back home. Norm Oshrin",2002-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Morgan Stanley was named the lead underwriter last week for the initial stock offering of JetBlue Airways of New York -- an offering that will surely be one of the more high-profile deals of the year. But Morgan Stanley had the inside track years ago. In the late 1990's, when David Neeleman, JetBlue's founder and chief executive, was visiting Manhattan from his home in Salt Lake City to try to sell his business plan for a no-frills airline based at Kennedy Airport, Kevin Murphy, Morgan Stanley's airline analyst, offered to put him up in his East Side apartment. The frugal Mr. Neeleman ended up staying over several times before JetBlue got off the ground in early 2000. Mr. Murphy has also invested nearly $125,000 in the fledgling airline. The two men first met when Mr. Neeleman was president of Morris Air, a low-fare airline based in Salt Lake City. Morgan Stanley was supposed to take Morris Air public, but it was sold to Southwest Airlines in 1993. Now, if all goes according to plan, Morgan Stanley will finally gets its fee from Mr. Neeleman.

Still, as the last recordings of a conductor who was known for his Strauss, these disparate pieces have both taken on a stamp of authority, all the more so since both feature Deborah Voigt, said to be Sinopoli's favorite soprano and arguably the leading Strauss soprano on the scene today. Both, moreover, were made with the Dresden Staatskapelle, which Sinopoli led for a decade and which has its own Strauss tradition, since it played the world premieres of 9 of the composer's 15 operas.",2002-02-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Lessons of Terror'," Long before the deliberate military targeting of civilians as a method of affecting the political behavior of nations and leaders came to be called terrorism, the tactic had a host of other names. From the time of the Roman republic to the late eighteenth century, for example, the phrase that was most often used was destructive war. The Romans themselves often used the phrase punitive war, although strictly speaking punitive expeditions and raids were only a part of destructive war. For while many Roman military campaigns were indeed undertaken as punishment for treachery or rebellion, other destructive actions sprang out of the simple desire to impress newly conquered peoples with the fearsome might of Rome, and thereby (or so it was hoped) undercut any support for indigenous leaders. In addition, there was a pressing need to allow the famous Roman legions, who were infamously underpaid, to plunder and rape as a reward for their almost inhuman steadiness in the heat of battle. The example of Rome incorporates nearly every possible permutation of warfare against civilians. In this as in so many things, antiquity&#8217;s greatest state provided a remarkably complete set of precedents for many later Western republics and empires. ",2002-02-17T05:00:00+0000

The hottest souvenir at the Winter Games is the official United States Olympic team berets, made by Roots, a Toronto-based outfitter to Canadian preppies. The berets, navy blue and red trimmed, started flying out of Roots stores after the opening ceremonies, when President Bush was surrounded by beret-topped members of the team. The company reports that the hats sold out, at $19.95, by the end of the next day, and daily shipments have been selling out within the hour, not only at the two stores in Salt Lake City, but also at the Roots in SoHo and Beverly Hills. Outside Olympic events, bidders have offered to buy the berets off lucky wearers' heads for $60 each. Roots executives say they are selling about 10,000 a day, and wearers include not only Olympic athletes and spectators, but also Rosie O'Donnell, who donned one on her show last week. American Olympic officials contacted Roots after the Games in Nagano, Japan, four years ago, when the Canadian team scored style points with its red Roots poor-boy caps. ''I think its 9/11, the mood of the country, the way the team looked opening night,'' said Michael Budman, one of two American expatriates who started Roots in 1973.

The membrane is seamless. From Everest's peak to the floor of the Mariana Trench, creatures of one kind or another inhabit virtually every square inch of the planetary surface. They obey the fundamental principle of biological geography, that wherever there is liquid water, organic molecules, and an energy source, there is life. Given the near-universality of organic materials and energy of some kind or other, water is the deciding element on planet Earth. It may be no more than a transient film on grains of sand, it may never see sunlight, it may be boiling hot or supercooled, but there will be some kind of organism living in or upon it. Even if nothing alive is visible to the naked eye, single cells of microorganisms will be growing and reproducing there, or at least dormant and awaiting the arrival of liquid water to kick them back into activity.

This may sound like Douglas Adams territory, and indeed it is; Fforde has written a pop science fiction novel with brains and sass. ''The Eyre Affair'' is ostensibly set in 1985, but we're thrust into a world where revisionists have proved history to be malleable: the Crimean War rages on into its 131st year, Wales is a Soviet Republic, and England is beholden to Goliath, a multimedia corporation. Most important, literature is nearly the stuff of religion, and a savage extortionist named Acheron Hades is Britain's No. 1 heretic, reviled for wreaking havoc with the great novels of the Victorian era. Most recently, he's kidnapped and murdered Mr. Quaverley, an inconsequential character he extracts from Dickens's original manuscript of ''Martin Chuzzlewit.'' Enter Thursday, a book cop of sorts with a rogue time-warp-cop for a father, a novelist ex-boyfriend and an Uncle Mycroft, the inventor of something called the ''Prose Portal.'' When Hades uses Mycroft's literary time machine to abduct Jane Eyre, Thursday embarks on a rescue mission that puts her at risk of being trapped forever inside the world of Bront's masterpiece. Fforde delivers almost every sentence with a sly wink, and he's got an easy way with wordplay, trivia and inside jokes. ''The Eyre Affair'' can be too clever by half, and fiction like this is certainly an acquired taste, but Fforde's verve is rarely less than infectious. Kera Bolonik",2002-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Using ingredients like black sesame paste, licorice and poppy seeds, these new desserts are equally about flavor and style. At Citarella on the Avenue of the Americas at 49th Street, a black sesame pudding (left, $8) is served in a clear glass bowl on a square white plate that is bathed in black sesame seeds: the effect is pure Calvin Klein in an enticing architectural way. District, at the Muse Hotel on West 46th Street, makes a black sesame seed pineapple upside-down cake ($7), while Tan Da on Park Avenue South (24th Street) has a black sticky-rice confection. And at Clove, the restaurant on 80th Street near Madison Avenue, deep-fried black squid-ink ravioli are stuffed with bananas and cinnamon and served with ice cream. ''Black is the universal color of fashion,'' said William Yosses, the pastry chef at Citarella. ''It has intrinsic allure in terms of mystery, seduction and romance. Black desserts are unique in that they must be both gastronomically and stylistically appealing -- because of this, they attract the attention of the chic yet adventurous diner.''

What they might have called sports ontology we call sports psychology, which is the discipline of helping athletes find their true potential in the moments when it counts most. No matter how much an athlete trains, it's rarely possible to train in a way that completely reproduces the circumstances of Olympic competition, the years of waiting, the screaming fans, the sense of national and team pride. The moment can't be examined until you're actually in it.

The plane, American Airlines Flight 882, which took off at 7:30 p.m., landed at 10:15 p.m., said Dan Bledsoe, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The signal was sent about an hour into the flight, which was scheduled to end at Newark. The tower contacted airline officials, who were able to contact the captain, said John Hotard, a spokesman for American Airlines. The captain was unaware that the signal had been sent. The airline then notified military officials to say the signal had been a false alarm, but the F-16s accompanied the plane to Newark anyway, Mr. Hotard said.

us,Always a Gentleman,"''I leave you the truth,'' Marlene Dietrich is said to have told her daughter, Maria Riva, before dying. She also left some 25,000 other things, including every dispatch she ever received from her legendary convoy of lovers. Hundreds of these belongings, along with portraits of Dietrich by her mentor, Josef von Sternberg, and recollections from those who knew her, have been collected in the lavish MARLENE DIETRICH: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MEMORIES (Knopf, $40), compiled by Jean-Jacques Naudet, with captions by Riva with Werner Sudendorf. You can learn a lot about a person by rummaging through her things, and yet even if none of the pieces are missing the story can remain a puzzle. Among Dietrich's feathers, furs and flames can be found a pair of pistols believed to have belonged to Gen. George S. Patton, a playful letter of apology from William Randolph Hearst, a ''highly insured'' Russian sable cloak Dietrich often ''lost'' when she was broke (it was always returned), a musical saw and a battered rotary phone held together with tape. Between an angelic portrait of Dietrich and her daughter and a wartime snapshot of Marlene emerging from the Hollywood Canteen, where she worked kitchen detail, we find an unsigned telegram from her sometime lover Maurice Chevalier. ''I do not even want your friendship,'' it reads. ''Everything is absolutely finished between us. Nonetheless it is the best thing that could happen to me.'' The result of such strange juxtapositions is suggestive, to say the least, especially because Dietrich's own voice is conspicuously absent from the book. There is no indication, for example, of what provoked Chevalier's resentment. But of course, a lady never tells, and, as legend has it, Dietrich once said she was ''always a gentleman at heart.''

That's why Mision Burrito in Hoboken is such a find. To call it a restaurant is a stretch. It's really a take-out joint, with stools by the window and dcor consisting of a wooden clock shaped like Mexico and a sombrero on the wall. But who cares about atmosphere when the food, prepared in a spotless open kitchen, is so good? Burritos ($7 to $10.50) are made the overstuffed California way, with rice and red or black beans packed inside a flour tortilla, along with a choice of chili, skirt steak, chicken, or spinach and goat cheese. Some include guacamole and sour cream, and all come with lettuce, pico de gallo and cactus strips (think Mexican pickles) on the side. The bay burrito is especially tasty, with shredded chicken that's been stewed with onions and peppers. The result is a layered flavor combination that puts the competitors' rubber bird to shame. Enchiladas ($8) are another standout, topped with cheese and slathered with a tangy tomatillo sauce, then baked in the oven so they arrive piping hot. If you can't make up your mind, there is a value-packed combination platter ($10), which includes a chicken burrito, a cheese enchilada, a beef taco and rice, beans and salad. Mision Burrito faces Church Square Park, so if the weather is fair, diners can pull up a park bench and watch all of Hoboken parade by. In my book, that beats a kitschy chain Mexican restaurant any day. Gretchen Kurtz",2002-02-24T05:00:00+0000

Witenberg, M.D., who served as Director from 1963-1992. Dr. Witenberg's service for so many years, while extraordinary, was just one small measure of his singular, indefatigable, and all encompassing dedication to the White Institute. A larger than life personality, Earl's characteristic New England sparseness, straightforwardness, stubbornness and skepticism both intrigued and tantalized his colleagues and his students. Few people who came in contact with Earl left his compelling presence without a spirited story to tell about him. Earl's scholarship was profound and his curiosity boundless. During his early tenure at the White Institute, his research vision encompassed a wide range of areas. He initiated a Visiting Distinguished Lecturer Series and he spearheaded innovative conferences to which he invited scholars from related fields, and of many schools of thought, to enrich the Institute's intellectual foundation. Earl insisted on challenging conventional thinking and in eschewing dogmatism; thereby both contributing to the education and training of creative thinkers who could embrace ambiguity, and shaping the essential and lasting identity of the White Institute. Earl's pragmatism was no where more evident than in his leadership of the Institute. He brought it from financial uncertainty to economic solvency, and purchased a landmark building. He felt that an institute could not sustain itself unless it was constantly responsive to change. He was a decisive leader: tough, persuasive, courageous, canny and occasionally irascible. Dr. Witenberg had a superb reputation as a psychoanalyst. He was concerned with the real and actual nature of the analyst's involvement with the patient, and his deep respect for the ''other'' along with his penetrating views into character made him a widely sought after and much respected analyst and supervisor. Honest to a fault, and curiously but touchingly vulnerable, Earl had little tolerance for inauthenticity. A gallant soul, Earl remained committed to the Interpersonal tradition, and he stood for the best that he, the Institute, and its graduates could offer. His legacy is enduring and more concretely forged by the Earl G. Witenberg Chair. The Chair is among the many honors awarded to him in 1992, and one which will go forward to promote the work in which he always felt privileged to engage. Our deep condolences to his wonderful family whom he loved without limit. Charles C.

us,New Chic: No Sleep,"Good news for insomniacs: At New York's Fashion Week, dark under-eye circles became a beauty statement, with models for Marc Jacobs, Helmut Lang and Balenciaga wearing fake shadows. At the Marc by Marc Jacobs show, the makeup artist Dick Page, inspired by the naturally dark coloring of the models Erin Wasson and Hannelore Knuts, painted the haggard chic look on the rest of the runway walkers, using mauve-brown shadow. ''Women with white disks of concealer under their eyes look so unnatural,'' Mr. Page said. ''Natural shadows make the eye color look more intense.''

He graduated from Cathedral Preparatory School and Saint Joseph's Seminary. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 7, 1941. His first Mass was celebrated at Saint Boniface Church, his home parish. Cardinal Spellman appointed Father Jablonski to the faculty of the new Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1942. Over the course of more than twenty years that he spent there, he established a reputation that grew throughout the city of New York for his stern and demanding expectations of students as Dean of Discipline, earning him the nickname ''Jabbo'' from a generation of Hayesmen. Elevated to Monsignor by Pope John XXIII in 1961, he was installed as Fire Chaplain in 1962. His career with the Fire Department extended for twenty years. During that time, he distinguished himself in service to New York's bravest. While still Chaplain, he was appointed pastor of Saint Valentine's Church on East 221st Street in the Bronx. He continued to minister to the parish until its closing in 2001. Monsignor Jablonski was predeceased by his brother, Louis. In addition to his sister-in-law, Vincenza H.

The judge, Michael B. Mukasey, said he was responding to assertions by critics that the court's response to the attacks was widespread secret detentions of people in violation of their rights. Judge Mukasey did not offer specifics about the material-witness hearings, but he said he was not surprised that detainees, who may speak about their cases, did not chose to do so. ''I think you can probably conclude,'' he said, ''it is because they and their lawyers believed that it is not to their advantage to go in front of a camera and say, 'You know what?

'' Judge Mukasey made his comments on Tuesday night before a panel on news media access to terrorism cases held at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.

The slowdown meant Britain's economy grew 1.7 percent from the period a year earlier, compared with expectations of 1.9 percent.

It was not clear what if any role beyond sharing with some of the hijackers the same address in Falls Church, Va., that Mr. Alfauru played in the ring that provided the illegal identification or in the Sept. 11 attacks. According to an affidavit filed in the court here by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, at the very least some of the hijackers benefitted from the work of the same ring that aided Mr. Alfauru. The affidavit also said that Mr. Alfauru helped the ring assist others seeking phony identification by using his newly obtained credentials to vouch for them and falsely attest to their identities and residences.
