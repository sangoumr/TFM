us,Film: Grotesque Effects:Horror Palls in 'Tales Witness Madness' The Cast,"Considering the generally depressed state of horror films these days, it takes a special kind of optimism to continue seeing them, especially when they are made by Freddie Francis, the distinguished English cinematographer (""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning""), who turned director about 10 years ago. Like a small child who sends off a coupon for a valuable free gift, you keep expecting a treasure, then receive something made of cardboard.""Tales That Witness Madness,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is Mr. Franci's glossiest, most absurd, almost-all-star horror film yet. Like his ""Torture Garden"" and ""Tales From the Crypt,"" it is a collection of unrelated stories that, this time, have as their connecting link a mad doctor (Donald Pleasence) who theorizes to his friend (the late Jack Hawkins) that truth has physical substance that can be isolated, like hormones.At least that is what I think his theory is, but the movie is less interested in theories than in grotesque effects, some of which are comic without being especially funny.There is, for example, the episode in which Kim Novak, playing a London literary agent in her most inept Lyiah Clare style, finds herself the hostess of a luau at which her teen-age daughter is served as a main course. In another episode, which recalls a much more interesting Ray Bradbury story in ""The Martian Chronicles,"" a little boy's imaginary playmate, a tiger, devours his nasty parents.The third tale is about a malevolent family portrait, and the fourth is about a shapely tree stump that comes between a not-so-young married couple played by Joan Collins and Michael Jayston. Jayston falls in love with the tree stump, which he keeps in the living room although the jealous Miss Collins describes it as ""ugly, sawn-off, upside-down and vile.""That's the best line in a film that otherwise depends on people saying such things as ""Darling you're imagining things"" and ""I just can't believe all this has happened.""",1973-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,World War II Triangle in 'Triple Echo':The Cast,"""Triple Echo"" is tenderly perceptive about such basics as loneliness, love and some aspects of sex, but as drama, the British import that arrived yesterday at the Playboy and Juliet I Theaters is disquietingly clouded. Although its sincerity and tragedy are obvious, the character and motivations of the principals in the World War II triangle involving an English farm woman, her soldier-lover and the rough sergeant who helps destroy their fragile idyll remain as indistinct as a distant echo.One warms to the pastoral romance that develops between Glenda Jackson, as the self-sufficient farmer tending her lonely acres while her husband is a captive of the Japanese, and the errant, young private from a local base. A viewer accepts the eventual love and sex, her lover's decision to desert and her plan to dress him as her ""sister"" to avoid detection and gossip, among other things.Miss Jackson's portrayal is, at first, poignant and convincing as she projects dignity and understandable desire for the love and companionship she has long missed.But she is somewhat less than credible subsequently as the strong-willed, bickering woman who, for debatable reasons, creates problems and then suffers her somewhat childish lover's alienation because of them.It is difficult to entertain the idea that Oliver Reed, as the brutish broth of a sergeant, would barge in on the household to make loutish advances, and invite the ""sister"" to an Army Christmas dance and not quickly discover the masquerade. And it seems improbable that Brian Deacon, a newcomer from British TV in the role of the masquerader, would chance the dangers of near-rape as well as exposure as a deserter. He is youthfully handsome but emotionally shallow in a characterization that could benefit by further explanations.Michael Apted, the director; Robin Chapman, the scenarist, and Graham Cottle, the producer, who are also making their movie debuts, fitfully capture nuances of speech and manners as lovely and real as the muted colors of the film's English countryside.

us,Film: Mysticism in U.S.:The Program,"Lavish hostility has been leveled against the new mysticism by those who feel that the upsurge of religious cults has siphoned off the political energies of the young. However, the charge doesn't seem to be historically validsince many began dropping out of politics well before the latest wave of gurus arrived. Ranging from fatigue to fears of Federal reprisal, fears of further Kent and Jackson States, ravaging fights among those on the same side, and the loss of confidence about being able to remake American society, the reasons for that massive recoil could (and no doubt will) make a book the length of ""The Sotweed Factor.""Meanwhile, emotional malnutrition has been rampant in this country. Hence it seems rather inevitable that someincluding people who tried and eventually rejected drugs  turned to various forms of religion.""Sunseed,"" which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, offers a sympathetic introduction to the New Age. The director, Fredrick Cohn, partakes of that movement himself. But he doesn't preach or clutch at converts. The documentary, which tours India as well as America, is based on interviews with 10 spiritual leaders and shows some of them meditating with their followers.From the Lama Anagarika Govinda in the Himalayan foothills to Ram Dass (formerly Dr. Richard Alpert) at a New Hampshire farm, or a Sufi meditation camp in Arizona, the stress is on both personal and world peace, receptivity to God (who isand isn'tdefined in a number of ways), a rejection of materialism, and the effort to dissolve the ego. There's also the suggestion that the new consciousness could free the enlightened from vulnerability. But we're also shown one young woman in tears because she feels guilty for not being able to embrace the faith.There are beguiling glimpses of the late Murshid Samuel L. Lewiswho was known as Sufi Sam to his disciples and also described himself as ""a roaring borealis""separating egg yolks in his disarrayed kitchen and advising: ""Be calm, cool, suave, diplomatic, and crazy."" Even skeptics will note that his followers like almost everyone in this picture, do look amazingly happy.Varieties of Buddhism and Hinduism overlap and alternate throughout ""Sunseed,"" along with Yoga, and it's a bit difficult for outsiders to untangle them. But even if the contrasts were clear, it would be impossible for the unconverted to judge the contents of this sensitive and skillfully made film. However, it does show some of the impact of mysticism on young people in America, especially their sense of ""skipping over a threshold"" into experiences that they've never known before. And it's easy to savor the stunning camera work of Baird Bryant and Robert Frank, along with the singing of the Sufi Choireven if you haven't blissed-out yourself.",1973-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: By Danny Lyon:The Program,"""The Films of Danny Lyon,"" the new program at the Film Forum, is a collection of three documentary films by the 31-year-old Brooklyn-born still photographer turned film-maker. The two best films in the collection, ""Llanito"" (61 minutes) and ""Soc. Sci. 127"" (21 minutes) are defined less by a developed cinematic style than by compassion for the subjects.""Llanito"" is a sorrowful montage of scenes of Indian life in the tiny New Mexico town of that name. It is not an especially finished film, but perhaps Mr. Lyon does not mean it to be.A couple of Indian men, half-kidding, dance around a beer can in a back alley. We listen to another man boast to the camera about his prowess as a hunter, while his mother mutters that the only thing he is good at is drinking.Juxtaposed against these scenes are others set in a home for the retarded, where, among other things, we listen to a white teen-age boy, who speaks in a high falsetto voice, telling us about freedom, sin, the crucifixion of Christ and the creation of the world (""God made everything out of nothing"").Mr. Lyon's fondness for bizarre images is balanced by a kind of solemn respect for his subjects. This is particularly true in ""Soc. Sci. 127,"" about an eccentric, hard-drinking tattoo artist named Bill Sanders, who, while he works, rambles on about Vietnam, lesbians and the art of what he advertises as ""velvety tattoos.""The third film on the program, ""El Chivot"" (The Goat) is a series of free associations on the life of goat and Indian. It runs six long, pretentious minutes.Mr. Lyon's skills as a photographer are evident throughout but I had the feeling in each of the films that he was still searching his images to find out what they might mean. This is not quite good enough.",1973-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Exciting Nureyev 'Don Quixote':The Cast,"Rudolf Nureyev has done so well with ""Don Quixote,"" his film version of a flawed 19th-century ballet, that he has actually made it more fun than the stage production. The result is a dance film for all audiences, an exciting, intelligently conceived spectacle.It is a film that takes the dangerous risk of wedding cinematic realism with formal ballet conventions and triumphs as a genre of its own. The tone is so consistent that it is not jarring at all to see Sancho Panza hit on the head with a lobster in one scene and to watch a full corps de ballet in tutus in another.Above all, ""Don Quixote,"" starring Mr. Nureyev, Sir Robert Helpmann and Lucette Aldous with the Australian Ballet, is the work of top professionals who have a firm understanding of their material. The film opened yesterday at the Festival Theater.In Geoffrey Unsworth, who photographed ""Cabaret"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" there is a cameraman immune to the usual penchant for cutting off dancers' feet and focusing away from the choreographic climax. In the innovative use of an overhead diagonal view, Mr. Unsworth succeeds splendidly in showing the dancer's full body with no foreshortening.This is as much a dramatic film as a ballet film. Not merely a photographed version of Mr. Nureyev's 1970 stage production of ""Don Quixote"" for the Australian Ballet, it now has crucial nondancing links. In Sir Robert, whose career has spanned ballet dancing and stage and film acting as well as directing, there is a co-director who (one suspects) is largely responsible for the coherence of the dance and nondance passages.There is, finally, the other co-director, Mr. Nureyev. Probably no dancer onstage today has done more to bring the great 19th-century ballet classics alive and make them relevant to a modern audience. This ""Don Quixote"" is a tribute to his extraordinary understanding of the tradition behind those ballets.Buy understanding the tradition, Mr. Nureyev can afford to depart from it occasionally. ""Don Quixote"" was not one of the master-pieces of Marius Petipa, the great French-Russian choreographer who is best known for ""The Sleeping Beauty."" Created in 1869, revised by the Bolshoi choreographer Alexander Gorsky and others, the ballet is not even really about Don Quixote.Mr. Nureyev has made an honest if conveniently spectacular statement about this ballet, by beginning the film in Barry Kay's vast street panorama of color and movement that focuses on the real hero and heroine  Basilio, the barber, and his love, Kitriand not with the usual prologue of Don Quixote in his chamber.The Kitri-Basilio romance is the crux of the story, and one of Mr. Nureyev's several new dances is a sexy duet in which Basilio persuades Kitri to go to bed with him.When she danced the role of Kitri in New York in 1971, Miss Aldousformerly of the Royal Balletwas just a little too tough. Now she gives us a properly earthy village girl, dancing with flourish and just right amount of comic upmanship to meet Mr. Nureyev on his own ground.For this is a comic ballet full of sunlight, and Mr. Nureyev is its Sun King. Those who have never seen him onstage will find the full Nureyev myth here right down to the virtuosity of the smashing final grand pas de deux.Only an actor who was also a premier danseur could handle the part of Don Quixote himself as excellently as Sir Robert. Detached but dignified, he turns the conventional 19th-century dream sequence away from a divertissement into a moment of dramatic truth.There is an exceptional performance from Ray Powell as Sancho Panza, and the Australian Ballet does fine work in what is frankly a back-up position.",1973-11-03T05:00:00+0000

The area is now a living museum with about onethird of its buildings restored as closely as possible to what they were in Spanish colonial times. San Juan was founded by Juan Ponce de Leon in the early 1500's, before he discovered Florida and more than 100 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Mass. The city has the Western Hemisphere's oldest executive mansion (La Fortaleza), and church (San Jose). The institute oversees all aspects of historical restoration and among the results are gracious homes with interior patios, sweeping arches and carved wood balconies. Most gift shops, art galleries and restaurants are in restored buildings, as are the many small museums operated by the institute. A tour of the old city should include visits to the massive stone ramparts of El Morro and Fort San Cristobal, from which attacks by Sir Francis Drake and other marauders were repulsed.

In Professor Day's milder words, Lowry was no natural. The early drafts of his works are clumsy and curiously naive, and he had to batter them into shape by, literally, endless rewriting. His one masterpiece, Under the Volcano, took him 10 years to complete and went through four separate drafts, the last of which itself went through at least four stages.

It is selfevident that the story of man, like that of any other species, is a constant struggle for nourishment and that, even when some men have been able to dominate that struggle for limited times, it profoundly shaped their conduct and their beliefs. Claude LeviStrauss (The Raw and the Cooked, From Honey to Ashes) traced a myth of Creation among American Indians and found that the Hero was punished by Fire and saved by Water, or punished by Water and saved by Fire, according to whether the tribe that told the myth boiled its food or baked it.

us,Home cooking from Peking,"The most refined cuisine of China comes appropriately from the north, from the region around Peking, the political, intellectual and cultural center of the country. Yet few Americans are familiar with it. Many, of course, have heard of Peking Duck; a privileged few have dined on this crispy skinned delicacy which is served with thin pancakes, scallions and sweet bean paste. But there are other superb dishes that deserve recognition, the Mongolian Firepot, for instance, which was brought to Peking by Kublai Khan. And the subtly sophisticated Sweet and Sour Carp. This is a dish that can be truly savored only in Peking, for the carp must come from a certain stretch of the Yellow River where the water is exceptionally clear and the fish are livelier than any place else. Peking cooking is known for its subtlety, its sophistication and its mildnessnot to be confused with blandness. The complicated dishes are based on two methods of preparation: Pao and Liu. Pao, very briefly, is a matter of stirfrying ingredients that are coated with a thick bean sauce over very high heat. The art consists of rendering down the sauce so that scarcely any is left, but not burning it. Liu demands even more skill and knowledge. With this method, food is cooked in rice wine or sometimes in vinegar to which sugar and cornstarch are added. Achievement of the correct flavor, smoothness and consistency is all important Great chefs used to vie with each other to achieve the ultimate subtlety. But for American cooks, the menu on these pages is a more rational introduction to northern cooking. The techniques are simple. One does not need to worry that the results might displease Confucius. The Velvet Chicken, a delicately flavored dish that lightened with eight egg whites, accompanied by a stirfried dish that uses up the egg yolks.

us,Suspense Film Dramatizes Kennedy Assassination:The Cast,"If disbelief is one of our healthiest national reflexes, at least it has been well exercised in the years between the Warren Report and the latest protestations about the nonbeing of those Presidential tapes. The only danger is that fact itself can be a victim of disbelief: Ugly news that happens to be true becomes easier to ignore, and good news gets rejected with a cackle.""Executive Action,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet, offers a tactful, low-key blend of fact and invention. The film makers do not insist that they have solved John Kennedy's murder; instead, they simply evoke what might have happened, according to various researchers, including Mark Lane.The result is a cool, skillful, occasionally confusing argument for conspiracy. Wealthy rightwingers (Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan) wanted Kennedy removed because he was going to sign the test-ban treaty, ""lead the black revolution"" and probably pull out of Vietnam. The last two points may give you the hiccups, but that is what these characters say.Like calm businessmen, they organize the event. While three talented marksmen rehearse by shooting at dummies in a car driven through the desert, the conspirators search for a nut to use as a patsy.Throughout the stress is on technology  even Oswald's name comes out of a computer. The movie follows the ""second Oswald"" theory, and this part of the plot is deftly constructed, as is the disappearance of the three marksmen, also the calculations to ""have the F.B.I. watching the C.I.A."" and vice versa, while relying on the inefficiency of the Secret Service.The conspirators are cleverly cloaked in the style of Camelot itself. Lancaster and Ryan appear as pensive, practical semi-academics, rationally planning an act as bloody as a small foreign invasion. (They admit that they sometimes ""sound like gods,"" since they are also planning the world's future  ""Well, somebody's got to do it."") Both have the confidence and the casual class that we recall in many Kennedy appointees. Lancaster, looking miraculously young, overdoes the ""sincerity"" at momentsan old habit of his. And there are too many shots of the conspirators smiling ironically at once another. But Ryan is wonderfully benign and wry, wisely underplaying where others might have gone all out for evil.However, it is far more painful to think of Ryan's death  a few weeks after this movie was finished  than Kennedy's. And that is the problem lurking in this movie. Television footage is used to paw at the public's sentiments; we see Kennedy smiling and golfing and kissing his children, as well as making speeches. But ""Executive Action"" is emotionally disconnected from history to the degree that those with an affection for suspense can enjoy the build-up of the plotting  even though we know how the assassination turned out.Despite the flags crawling down flagpoles and the drumbeats, a national trauma has become a competent thriller. And it is just as well. Reliving the shock of that killing would hardly benefit any kind of audience now.So whether you chime with this interpretation, or, like a few I know, decide to embrace all the conspiracy theories of the assassination, the movie is useful in rousing the questions once again. The film's sternest and strongest point is that only a crazed person acting on his own would have been acceptable to the American public  which, at that time, certainly did not want to believe in a conspiracy.",1973-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Robin Hood':Animals and Birds Star in Disney Version The Program,"Once upon a time in Sherwood Forest there lived a fox named Robin Hood who, with his good friend, a sportive brown bear named Little John, stole from the rich to give to the poor.Nearby Nottingham was occupied by elephants, rhinos, hippos and snakes, who were the escorts, advisers and chums of the evil Prince John, a scrawny lion whose crown was too big and who, in moments of national crisis, sucked his thumb and pulled his ear lobe. Nottingham Castle was run by incompetents. Guard duty was left largely to a dim-witted vulture who liked to yell ""one o'clock and all's well"" when it was often three o'clock and everything was terrible.An all-animal/bird version of Robin Hood? Good grief! But then, why not?The legend about the bandit of Sherwood Forest has survived more than a dozen screen adaptations, including ""Son of Robin Hood"" (1959), which was really about a daughter, and 165 half-hour television films.Walt Disney's multigenus, animated film version, which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, testifies to the legend's elasticity and durability. It should also be a good deal of fun for toddlers whose minds have not yet shriveled into orthodoxy.The visual style is charmingly conventional, as gently reassuring as that of a Donald Duck cartoon, sometimes as romantically pretty as an old Silly Symphony. Roger Miller, the composer (""King of the Road"") and humorist, provides the voice for Allan a Dale, the rooster who acts as the film's narrator, thus giving this ""Robin Hood"" a decidedly odd but not unpleasant country-and-Western flavor.The other voices are supplied by Peter Ustinov (Prince John), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck), Phil Harris (Little John), Brian Bedford (Robin Hood) and Pat Buttram (the Sheriff of Nottingham), whose voice, like Ustinov's, is a very funny mixture of villainy and absolute fraud.On the stage the Music Hall is presenting its annual Christmas show, including ""The Nativity."" It's not only that time flies, but also that the Music Hall helps rush it along.",1973-11-09T05:00:00+0000

But she was also a master of evoking scenery, from large landscapes to tiny gardens, and the life of other sentient beings, from the inhabitants of cafes and plazas to the inhabitants of lonely rooms. Her personal style, informal yet lyrical and romantic, a constant over her six books of poems culminating in Canntry Without Maps (1964) and New and Selected Poems (1967), adhered to no school and was not influential.

There were more hassles, but finally Rosdail arranged passage last summer.

But the struggle for power between Anthony Quinn, other dons and the young gunmen in this Mafia-like gangland, is sound and fury that imitates but rarely flatters the big guns in the genre from the 1930 ""Little Caesar"" to ""The Godfather.""Expertise, if not imagination, is evident in the explosive, action-oriented direction of Richard Fleischer as an aging Anthony Quinn battles the likes of Frederic Forrest, Robert Forster and others for control of the mob and its illicit enterprises. Naturally, these ""families"" are enmeshed in doublecrosses and misunderstandings that seem confusing only to the principals involved. A fairly attentive viewer can see it all coming before Quinn falls for Forster's girl, the pretty, altruistic chanteuse-song-writer, Angel Tompkins, and unwittingly sets off the fireworks.Any red-blooded American boy should be delighted by the virtually incessant bullets and gore and a climactic bombing and shootout. But ""The Don Is Dead"" has the attributes of some lively, pithily accented performances that are adult and effectively natural. Among these are Forrest, as the brainly hood who attempts to escape the racket, but winds up a don; Al Lettieri, as his roughhewn, dependent, ill-fated brother, and Forster, as the rising, vengeful muscleman who is eventually cut down.As the embattled don who is finally felled by a stroke, not a gun, Quinn is moodily menacing and as polished and relaxed as a professional long familiar with this sort of role. He is off the mark, however, when he observes, quality can be bought, talent can't."" There's talent, if not quality, in ""The Don Is Dead.""",1973-11-15T05:00:00+0000

James B. Harris, the film's producer-director-writer, may have been fulfilled, but it is awfully difficult for even a willing viewer to appreciate the sadly diffuse fantasies of an erstwhile sideshow sleeping beauty, a rich, weird temptress and the bemused young man they both seem to adore.Since this odd affair was inspired by John Collier's short story ""Sleeping Beauty,"" it should be noted that the setting has been changed from Britain to a baronial mansion on the West Coast owned by Carol White, who not only goes for Zalman King, a jazz saxophonist, but also for Tisa Farrow, the resuscitated ""beauty"" he brings to that strange household. Miss White, by the way, also digs Veronica Anderson, the blonde maid, and loves to dress up as a nun.Mr. King, who sports a wild mane of hair and a woebegone expression, cannot be faulted for appearing confused most of the time. Miss White, who is slightly imperious and sexy as the seductress, spouts such dialogue as ""When a woman loves a man, there's no limit to her understanding."" Tisa Farrow (Mia Farrow's younger sister) is pretty, but essentially juvenile, as the innocent, awakened beauty.Mr. Harris, who produced Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Lolita"" and ""The Killing"" and produced and directed ""The Bedford Incident,"" has provided ""Some Call It Loving"" with sumptuous, rococo dcor.

us,Screen: A Real Loser:Fassbinder's 'Merchant of Four Seasons' Here The Cast,"It gets harder and harder to believe in victimsin people who do not precipitate what happens to them. But Rainer Fassbinder's ""The Merchant of Four Seasons,"" which opened this week at the Greenwich Theater, projects a kind of loserism that the main character seems powerless to control.This German movie focuses on a stolid depressive (Hans Hirschmuller) whose middle-class family has always been ashamed of him, and its lack of enthusiasm appears to be the main cause of his breakdown and eventual suicide. They are also disgusted by his career of selling fruit in the streets, rather as though he were pimping.Because of turgid directing and acting, most of the emotions in this picture ring false. When the hero's wife phones her lawyer for a divorce, her husband has the unlikeliest heart attack in movie history. And when he finally drinks himself to death in front of his relatives, they watch and gape like paralyzed puddings until his scene is played outor like obedient actors who know that they must not interrupt the star.Fassbinder's fiercest weakness is the way that his characters respond to one another. He also specializes in delayed reactions. Throughout, eyes lock in significant glances or in prolonged, stunned stares. A man slaps a woman; she gasps and grabs her cheek, then both of them freeze. A wife learns that her husband is getting drunk in a bar, and she clutches the telephone receiver to her chest to show distress. Two long separated friends meet in a cafeteria: One drops a tray of food (astonishment). And there is a maddening moment when the fruit vendor yells down the stairs for his wife, and then weepswhich is simply a crude crib from Brando in ""Streetcar.""""The Merchant,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center in 1972, is not so bad as Fassbinder's ""The Bitter Fears of Petra Von Kant,"" one of the silliest movies I have seen in years. But here it looks as though the director was torn between chronicling a crackup and making a film about how to run a small business. The problems of hiring a reliable staff and the proprieties of bookkeeping take up a good deal of footage, and that is boring. But this soggy picture allows the disintegration of a human being to be almost as dull as the way he earns his livingand that is appalling.",1973-11-17T05:00:00+0000

C. Fields, be was wont to say that Philadelphia was the only town of his acquaintance that closed on Sundays. The master, alas, is gone, but his assessment unfortunately lingers. Even love in Philadelphia is brotherly. Nevertheless, for those disposed to see what there is of night life here, there is a Vegasstyle glitter at the nearby Latin Casino (215WA 34343) across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, N.J. The nightly features are the food, the drinks and the likes of Tom Jones and Ray Charles. Considerably hipper is The Spectrum (FU 95000) at Broad and Pattison, right in Philadelphia, a sports hall that books groups like the J. Geils Band for dance concerts. Prices along the nightclub circuit are gradually inching up on those in New York, It is advisable to phone first for covers and minimums. Palumbo's (MA 7.7272) in South Philadelphia, Mayor Frank Rizzo's favorite boite, is big, noisy and serves Sergio Franchi with the spaghetti and scungilli. On the other hand, since Frank Rizzo is the guy who vetoed the purchase for the city of a Jacques Lipchitz statue, dubbing it an abortion that looks like some workmen dropped a load of wet plaster, those with more worldly sensibilities might prefer a place in which, His Honor would not be caught dead  Harlow's (WA 29222), named for a former male, whose sexchange operation made her the switch hit of the city, or if not Harlow's then one of the other trendy clubs nearby. Longhairs and kindred types will feel more at home in the downtown Sansom Village area at places like Artemis (LO 79958), Oops (LO 76800) and Snagletooth (LO 78304), where the sounds are, as they say, heavy. Older heads will like Just Jazz (LO 73189), on downtown Arch Street, where you might hear the MJQ or Jimmy Smith.

So those who come to it hoping for either sexual or political scandal will be disappointed. What they will find is a sympathetic, dispassionate portrait of a confused and talented woman. The book deals pleasantly, competently, even poignantly (though not profoundly) with Jane's childhood under dour father Henry and its bequest of drives to later life and work, but fails to deal satisfactorily with her conversion to radical activism, or, perhaps, simply fails to make interesting something that intrinsically isn't.",1973-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Clive Barnes: The New York Shakespeare Festival's first play at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is the fourth play by David Rabe that Joseph Papp has produced, and it is also the first play by David Rabe that does not deal with Vietnam. The problem is to decide what it does deal with. It is possibly intended as a portrait of a young tramp as a neurotic. Its heroine is Chrissie, a gogo girl in Philadelphia, who dreams ofwell, she seems to dream of very little really. The trouble with the play is that we are asked to spend three hours with Chrissie, and we really know no more about her at the end than we did at the beginning. It would have been quicker to send a telegram. Mr. Rabe was not helped at all by the production, which seemed to fasten on the weakest aspects of the play. The play is said to be directed by Mr. Papp, but, of course, as has been announced, Julie Bovasso was in charge until a few days ago. Still, as it is, Mr. Papp must take the rap. Let us hope that the Shakespeare Festival will have better luck next time. For Walter Kerr, see Page 3.",1973-11-18T05:00:00+0000

With just a little more money, I can produce a classic, elegant dinner for six people (the one outlined on these pages is an example) for less than, say, $2.50 a person. The menu presented today consists of consomme, chicken in vinegar, puffed potatoes, a salad, cheese and a superb orange tart. The total cost of the meal, which included two bottles of wine as well as a predinner aperitif, was $14.59 ($2.43 a person).

us,Film:'England Made Me':Novel by Greene' Is Lost in Adaptation,"""England Made Me,"" a screen adaptation of Graham Greene's ironic novel written in 1935, proves that a little hindsight can often be too much. In this case it's fatal.Peter Duffell, the director of the film, which opened yesterday at the Paris, and co-author of the screenplay with Desmond Cory, has had the presumption to straighten out Graham Greene by transferring the story's locale from Sweden in the midnineteen-thirties to Nazi Germany, which is fast becoming a rather sick movie joke.If, as some recent films would have us believe, the Nazis spent so much time at orgies, slurping up the old bubbly and snapping bra straps, it's a miracle they could ever stagger into the Rhineland, much less manage a coherent blitzkrieg.The shift in place has had the effect of transforming Greene's novel, based loosely on the last days of Ivar Kreuger, Sweden's swindling match king, from a post-Depression story of ambition and fatigue into one of those heavily ominous, pre-holocaust dramas that see every event as an indication of Things To Come. It also allows for orgies, parades of storm troopers and other picturesque if irrelevant details.Even though this is not Greene, ""England Made Me"" might have worked, were Mr. Duffell and Mr. Cory less superficial movie makers. They've retained a surprising amount of the Greene plot, even a lot of original dialogue, but the story is no longer comic and rueful, just wildly melodramatic. The prototypical Greene characters are evident, but they look out of place. The scenery is wrong. It throws everything out of focus.This is most apparent in the performances of Peter Finch and Michael York. Mr. Finch plays the Kreuger character, now portrayed as a swindling German financier who has no love for the Nazis, but who doesn't hesitate to use Nazi strong-arm tactics. Mr. York is Tony Farrant, the twin brother of the financier's English mistress, Kate (Hildegard Neil), a supposedly charming scapegrace and liar whose English backbone finally stiffens when he is confronted with Mr. Finch's extraordinary amorality.Unless you have read the novel, I doubt whether you'll have any idea of the relationships among the characters. Mr. Finch looks tired and glum, and Mr. York incapable of having the shabby past that is attributed to him. When he tells his sister ""I'm not a sponge,"" you believe him, which is wrong, Similarly, I never did believe the passion that Miss Neil is meant to have for her brother. They all seem to be play-acting.The only spot of pure Greene in the entire film is Michael Hordern as Minty, the scroungy, old-school Englishman who makes a living as a newspaperman in self-imposed exile. Poor old Minty, who once had a canary that sang too much and died, is a recurring theme in Greene's novels. When Minty is on screen, ""England Made Me"" suggests many levels of consciousnessof decisions made too late, of scruples wasted, of empire's endthat are nowhere else evident.It's not that Mr. Duffell is an unread director. At one moment he lets the camera linger on a beaten-up copy of ""The Waste Land"" on the floor by Minty's unmade bed. He's just a very clumsy one.",1973-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Harvard kept its stock. And the issue of independence for black Angolans hasn't gained much attention in this country.But now a very fine film, set in 1961, brings us a slab of the recent Angolan pastand forces us to wonder if the present is any different. ""Sambizanga,"" which opened Wednesday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, was directed by Sarah Maldoror, who was the assistant to Gillo Pontecorvo for ""The Battle of Algiers."" One of her collaborators on the screenplay was her husband, Mario de Andrade, a leader in the Angolan resistance. Since the movie couldn't be made in Angola, it was filmed in the Congo.""Sambizanga"" focuses on a young black couple (splendidly played by Domingus Oliviera and Elisa Andrade), who bask in each other's presence until the husband, a tractor driver, is suddenly arrested as a political prisoner.His wife, who knows nothing about his politics, walks with their baby on her back from village to village, between fields of tall grasses and huge hills, trying to locate him. Angry or desperate at moments, stoical at others, she struggles through a world that rarely explains anything to women. While she's sent from one police station to another, often repulsed or lied to, he's beaten by inquisitors who torture him in hopes of learning the names of others in the movement. He remains mute, but we almost wish that he would talk. And even his death is a relief.The power of this picture lies in contrasts. The fact that the inquisitors are murderers as well as racists is highlighted by the calm con-??? as blacks. Despite the daily suffering, there's also a stress on friendship and affection, the ease of intimacy and some fond teasing among people who are close, plus the gaiety of dancing and music and feasting. Therefore, when we see prisoners walking slowly in a small circle inside the prison yard, we're all the more aware of the simple freedoms of those on the outsidewho are at least able to stroll down a street or through a doorway.When the prisoners delicately cleanse the bloodied face of the husband's corpse, singing to him rather as though they were trying to comfort the dead, we remember him laughing and joking with his wife. It's that range of possibilitiesgood or atrocious, life enhancing or death dealingthat makes ""Sambizanga"" a revolutionary picture. Both subtly and simply, we're shown how bad things are, how much better they could be. As Americans, we may feel helpless while we watch this film. Yet the determination for change is deeply contagious.The movie doesn't put forth heroes or villains, and it offers a class analysis rather than a racial one. The emphasis is on the oppression of the poor by the richon the system that perpetuates a minority. Throughout, the plight of individuals helps to nail the political point. Meanwhile, let's hope that this impressive new director makes many sequels to her first feature film.",1973-11-22T05:00:00+0000

The film opened yesterday at the National and other theaters.The setting is not really Disneyland but a complex of three resorts  Westworld, Romanworld and Medievalworld  that carry some of the Disneyland-Disney World concepts as far as they can go.Guests at Westworld, for example, like the two Chicago businessmen played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin, pay $1,000 a day each to realize their fantasies about living in the Old West.In a perfect reproduction of a frontier town, they can spend two weeks having the times of their lives in barroom fights, robbing the bank, shooting the sheriff and sleeping with the local dancehall girls, who are, like all the other citizens of the town, life-sized, computerized robots.Crichton the director seems to have had more fun with the film than Crichton the writer, whose screenplay can offer us no better explanation for the sudden, bloody robot rebellion than an epidemic of ""central mechanism psychosis."" This basic facetiousness is partly obscured by the vivid and sometimes amusing dimension of the film's anecdotes, which are mostly about the peril of the guests when make-believe gives way to reality.In addition to Benjamin and Brolin, the cast includes Yul Brynner as the town sheriff, who has no more humanity or sense of justice than a multicycle washing machine.",1973-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Should Barbara, after emerging from that fancy Swiss clinic looking a fabulous 41, have an affair with a much younger man whose stare contains a sexual message?What should she say when Mark looks at her, his eyes filled with memories but empty of desire? Should she lie in the sun? Eat pastries? Hit Mark on the head with a shoe?Every question save the last is proposed in ""Ash Wednesday,"" and then answered at somewhat greater length than is absolutely necessary for anyone over the age of 2. The movie opened yesterday at Loews State 2 and Loews Cine Theaters.""Ash Wednesday"" was directed by Larry Peerce (""A Separate Peace,"" ""Goodbye, Columbus,"" etc.) and written by Jean-Claude Tramont with all the fearlessness and perception demanded in the boiling of an egg.It would have us believe that such pursuits of youth are doomed to failure, yet it treats the reconstructed Barbara (who is, after all, Elizabeth Taylor, one of the world's great beauties) less as a woman to be understood than as an artifact to be admired.Barbara is miserable, of course, but miserable in some of the most magnificent settings (Cortina, the Dolomites) that money can buy.""Ash Wednesday"" has some shock effect in its early surgical scenes, showing us how the subcutaneous tissue is removed (what we really see is chicken fat) to firm up the skin under Barbara's eyes and other organs. Mostly the film is interested in what Barbara is going to wear next.

us,A Gentle 'Cajun' Documentary,"Les Blank's ""Dry Wood and Hot Pepper,"" which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is a gentle, two-part documentary about the life and music of the French-speaking blacks in southwestern Louisiana's Cajun country.The two parts, ""Dry Wood,"" 37 minutes, and ""Hot Pepper,"" 54 minutes, flow one into the other so easily that the only lines of demarcation between them are the closing credits of the first and the opening credits of the second.Although the film was made within the last several years, it has the air of someone's remembering events of long ago. This is particularly true of ""Dry Wood,"" and is due in part to the seemingly stable quality of lives being explored, as well as to Mr. Blank's manner, which is to pay almost as much attention to the landscapes, seasons and weather as to people.This isn't necessarily the most interesting kind of film making. It has the effect of softening the focus so that we can barely define the sharp, rough edges of the lives he shows us. He prefers to record the happy times, the preparations for a rural Mardi Gras, the daily routines of farm life that are a continuing life cycle.At one point a farm woman, who has borne 16 children and reared 14, recalls the good old days when people sat around and talked. Now, she says, the men drink and the children leave, one by one. She is, however, surrounded by members of her family, all at work preparing what looks to be a holiday feast.Clifton Chenier, something of a local celebrity who plays an electric accordion and has a small band, is the star of ""Hot Pepper,"" which devotes as much time to Chenier's music (a mixture of blues and Cajun) as it does to him and his friends. The music is full of soul and so exuberantly ironic that it cannot be especially sad, no matter what the lyrics say.A bit of barroom dialogue in this sequence is worth preserving. Says one customer, solemnly: ""People is people."" To which his friend gravely assents: ""Everywhere you go,"" prompting them both to laugh.The people in ""Hot Pepper"" take themselves less pompously than the film maker does, which is my only reservation about Mr. Blank's work.",1973-11-23T05:00:00+0000

All those lean years helped preserve the original hearths, floorboards, beams and other details that might have been swept away in a modernization. Today, the house holds a collection of country furniture, antique cooking utensils, coverlets and courting mirrors, chests and chairs that the owners have assembled in the 30 years of their marriage. They have watched attitudes toward restoration change over the years. Each generation has become more purist, they report.
