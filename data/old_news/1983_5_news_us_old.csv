We can't really pity him, however, because audiences do not tire of hearing his works and musicians pay him tribute in the best way possible, by incessantly performing his music. It would be hard to find a musician who would deny his importance. And yet, though this week marks the 150th anniversary of his birth, there remains something about Brahms that can breed antagonism. I remember once, in my infancy as a critic, suggesting to a famous violinist that perhaps Brahms was a minor composer who owed his status to the early publicity efforts in his behalf by Schumann and Joachim. The only response I received was a blank stare. This was also a period when I was convinced that ''Tosca'' and ''La Boheme'' would one day drop out of the opera repertory never to be heard from again.

The hooting reception awarded to ''Guntram'' in 1894 left permanent scars on the psyche of Richard Strauss. To rank as a genuine fiasco, an opera must be more than a passing scandal.

Selznick, grew up in Hollywood during its golden age, in the 1920's and early 1930's, when movies not only set the style for everything from women's hair fashions to men's undershirts but also gave America its largest vision of itself. The triumphs and follies of the stars were the folk tales of America, and fan magazines were required reading for millions. Hollywood was at the top of the scale in American popular culture, and Irene Mayer Selznick's father and then her husband sat atop that town. Louis B. Mayer, as head of production for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was the most important film maker of his time, producing dozens of popular hits - with ''more stars than there are in heaven,'' including Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford and Clark Gable. David O. Selznick reached the apex of his career with ''Gone With the Wind,'' released in 1939, which for years remained the most popular and most profitable of all Hollywood movies. After her Hollywood days, Irene Mayer Selznick came into her own - not just as daughter and wife - but as a leading Broadway producer, most notably of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''Bell, Book and Candle'' and ''The Chalk Garden.'' Her memoirs, ''A Private View,'' from which this article is adapted, will be published by Knopf later this month.

In ''Passion,'' at the Longacre, the English playwright Peter Nichols takes one of the oldest tales in the book - a middle-aged husband has an affair with a younger woman - and, with virtuoso writing and unsparing honesty, rocks the foundations of an audience's complacency.

It's the most savage view of marriage yet from the author of ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg'' and ''Forget-Me-Not Lane.''",1983-05-16T05:00:00+0000

THE LITTLE WORLD OF ABERGAVENNY","Take a map and run a finger down the border between Wales and England. A little over three-quarters of the way down, on the Welsh side, you come to Abergavenny, ringed by its mountains - Sugar Loaf, Deri, Skerrid, Blorenge. To the northwest are the Black Mountains, to the west the Brecon Beacons, and to the east, over on the English side of the border, the Wye Valley. Population 9,000 - a nice size - and on Tuesdays most of it seems to be out in town: ladies holding leisurely conversations at the baker's and gents in the pubs, which stay open all day because Tuesday, after all, is Market Day. This is when the town's vitality is most apparent; though the hill farms are small and nowhere in Britain is free of unemployment, this is a lively and prosperous center that tolerates tourists kindly but does not depend on them. (Abergavenny's official guidebook is anxious to assure its readers that it has the latest thing in shopping for everyone; and indeed there are supermarkets and gift shops and a Woolworth's and an astonishing number of shoe shops.)",1983-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"TV VIEW;
A SEARINGLY HONEST 'SONS AND LOVERS'","At New York's Museum of Broadcasting a week or so ago, Jeremy Isaacs, the head of the new, and already beleaguered, fourth television channel in Britain, was complaining that American audiences were not really given much of a chance to see the British drama productions that cope with pressing contemporary problems. American programming interests, he said, prefer to import ''costume dramas'' that keep unpleasant realities at a safe remove. The lushly aristocratic ''Brideshead Revisited'' or the nostalgia-drenched soap opera ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' get selected over more gritty productions that are usually presented as single plays. But in making his point, which has some validity, Mr. Isaacs was unfair, no doubt unintentionally, to the book adaptations he dismisses as costume dramas. The mini-series fare on a showcase such as ''Masterpiece Theater'' can frequently pack a relevancy wallop for modern audiences. Witness ''Sons and Lovers,'' the current multi-part offering that is being broadcast Sunday evenings at 9 on Channel 13.",1983-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,A Debate: Revamp the Board of Estimate?; ANOTHER ARM OF CITY HALL GETS TWISTED BY THE COURTS,"NEW YORK CITY'S governmental branches have been called many things, but none so troubling as the term now in vogue - unconstitutional. First, Federal Judge Edward R. Neaher ruled that the at-large system of representation in the Council violated the constitutional provision of one-man, one-vote because each borough had two at-large seats despite populations ranging from Brooklyn's 2.2 million to Staten Island's 350,000. Then a Federal appeals panel ruled last week that the Board of Estimate, which approves all financial matters, must conform with the same principle because its members were selected by popular election and it ''performs general governmental functions.'' The panel did not say that the board violated the provision; it sent the case back to Judge Neaher, who had initially decided that the rule did not apply, with instructions to determine whether population disparities deviated too far for equal representation on that body, too. That is the contention of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit. Richard Emery, staff counsel for the organization, has suggested increasing by various amounts the votes held by citywide officials and all the boroughs save Staten Island. That would be fairer for all New Yorkers, he argued, especially black and Hispanic residents not now represented on the board. But Anthony R. Gaeta, the Staten Island Borough President, has resisted any solution that would effectively reduce his power and, he contends, shortchange his borough. Though officials haven't decided the city's next move, Mr. Gaeta, for one, is ready to fight. Mr. Emery and Mr. Gaeta were asked last week to elaborate on their positions.",1983-05-22T05:00:00+0000

His latest effort, a highly provocative staging of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' at the Spoleto Festival, U.S.A., in Charleston, S.C., is unlikely to change his reputation for gleeful irreverence.

us,Pieces of a Plan For Indian Point Fall Into Place,"Officials have been burning the midnight oil to keep the nuclear power flowing from Indian Point, and last week they seemed to be making progress. After meetings with bus companies, drivers' unions and the operators of the reactors - Consolidated Edison and the New York Power Authority - Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'- Rourke announced an agreement on emergency planning. He said the unions would support a two-hour course in ''radiation emergency response procedures,'' the utilities, in addition to paying for the course and the time of the drivers taking it, would lease 1,000 buses and begin a $242,000 study of local roads, and Albany would furnish 1,000 dosimeters and a supply of potassium iodide, a drug that reduces the effects of radiation. None of this, of course, guarantees that 500 drivers would be available to transport those of the nearly 300,000 people living within 10 miles of the Buchanan complex who, in the event of an emergency, couldn't get out by themselves, but Mr. O'Rourke said he was confident ''we'll get the volunteers.'' Just in case, Dr. David Axelrod, the New York State Health Commissioner, suggested in a report to Governor Cuomo at week's end that cadets or army troops from West Point be pressed into service. It was widely agreed that all of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's concerns about Indian Point would not be resolved by the June 9 deadline, but state and local officials said they thought the agency might be satisfied with their efforts thus far.",1983-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the Divided Mind,"As a psychotherapist in the process of completing a successful treatment of a patient with a multiple-personalitylike illness, I read Ellen Hale's stimulating article ''Inside the Divided Mind'' (April 17) with particular interest. Though most therapists treat few true ''multiples,'' we do see a number of patients who, like mine, can be correctly diagnosed in the borderline-psychotic range, but who employ multiplelike defenses. These are patients whose early traumas were so severe that they created personality fragments which became ''keepers'' of the thoughts, feelings and memories associated with the experiences. These patients differ from multiples in that the fragments do not necessarily ''grow up'' with the patient. Rather, they emerge, to the surprise of the patient and therapist, in the course of treatment, as the memory of the trauma for which they were created becomes accessible to the patient's ego. The fragment looks and acts as it did when it was first created - often like an enraged or suicidal young child - as if emerging from a kind of psychological cryogenesis. Consequently, this development can be erroneously confused with transference psychosis, a severe regression of the patient in response to the therapist, usually to be avoided. On the contrary, the emergence of individual personality fragments in treatment is good and should be welcomed, though, of course, dealt with cautiously, since it signals the beginning of a systematic, though unconscious attempt by the patient to achieve fusion. In each successive working-through, there is a moment of risktaking when the fragment first needs to trust the rest of the personality, believing that though there was great danger once, it is now safe to give up its split-off existence.",1983-05-22T05:00:00+0000

The main thrust of their whining is that physicians in all specialties are paying too much in malpractice insurance premiums because of excessive awards to generally litigious patients who are egged on by avaricious lawyers eager to prey on them on a contingency basis. Their solution is to pass laws that will dramatically limit awards so their insurance rates can be reduced to reasonable amounts. This is analogous to solving our crime problems by giving shorter or no sentences to lawbreakers. To reduce crime, we must stop criminal behavior, which has been unsuccessfully attempted since the beginning of civilization. To reduce malpractice costs is easier.

A pivotal date if there ever was one, it marks the point in time when white wine moved up from its picnic-on-the-lawn image to a full-fledged succorer of shattered egos, bruised ids and thwarted ambitions. Most white-wine drinkers, whether at the ''21'' Club or in their own backyards, think of it as just that: white wine. Occasionally, someone will tell the waiter, ''I'd like a glass of chablis,'' but for the most part, no one other than the experienced enthusiast ever differentiates among the hundreds of different white wines on the market. It is ordered like a martini, with only an occasional inquiry as to exactly what is in the glass. But there is a great deal going on in the white-wine field, and it helps to know what's happening. To begin with, there is plenty of it around, thanks mostly to the Italians. What's more, a lot of it is pretty good. Not great, but good. About a decade ago, an unsung genius in the Italian wine business decided that it was time to find out what people wanted - as opposed to the time-honored French way: ''This is what we do; take it or leave it.'' The Italians threw out centuries of tradition - they had always made heavy, overoxidized white wines - and came up with new, fresh, lively wines that anyone could drink.",1983-05-25T05:00:00+0000

They see blocking these weapons as a first step toward removal of the thousands of other nuclear weapons that are now in place in Europe and, ultimately, to the dissolution of both great military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. This ultimate goal can be partly achieved. It would be the most important change in international politics since the end of World War II. But it would likely have consequences that are the opposite of what the antinuclear-weapons movements are seeking. The wish to escape from the control of the two superpowers and regain the freedom of maneuver in foreign policy that Europe lost in 1945 is understandable. The aspiration to independence is universal. No country will feel wholly comfortable while its fate rests in the hands of others. Some countries have no choice in the matter. In the European case, however, the wish can be partly fulfilled. The Soviet bloc is not about to dissolve, not as long as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has the power to prevent its dissolution - power that it islikely to have for a very long time. The Western alliance, however, is voluntary. It is not immune to change, including the sort of change sometimes advocated by the European antinuclear-weapons movements.",1983-05-25T05:00:00+0000

For some, who've struggled to find a concept, a way of approaching that concept and an individual voice in which to express it, change comes hard. Others see change as a challenge, and make it the very substance of their art. At one extreme is Josef Albers, content to spend more than 30 years exploring color in an unvarying format of two-dimensional nested squares; at the other is the protean Picasso, who shifted styles and mediums from moment to moment. But what is change to an artist, anyway? For one, it can simply mean a shift in the pressure of brush strokes from one abstract canvas to another; for the next it may mean a deep revision of style or theme. Should change always be regarded as development? Does a significant change in an artist's work render the earlier work less valid - or, as in the case of Giorgio de Chirico, who renounced his powerful ''metaphysical'' paintings for a flabby new style after World War I, is the new insignificant when judged by the standards of the old?",1983-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Earlier in the recital, the Japanese-born musician, who has studied in her native land and with Beveridge Webster at Juilliard, displayed a penchant for proper but episodic interpretations. And her preference in repertory for the Romantic epic and the Impressionist image required much more. Such works as Scriabin's Sonata No. 5 and Schumann's Fantasy were lacking in structure and drive. A broadly shaped phrase would end and another gesture would begin, at times stiffly. Miss Nakai's technique, while more than adequate, also stiffened in the face of some of Schumann's and Debussy's demands.",1983-05-29T05:00:00+0000

''I thought of Count di Luna (a character in Verdi's 'Trovatore'), but finally changed it for Corno di Bassetto, as it sounded like a foreign title and nobody knew what a corno di bassetto was.'' It was and still is, in fact, a melancholy-toned member of the clarinet family known in English as the basset horn. Shaw himself didn't know what a corno di bassetto was, as he gladly confessed: ''If I had ever heard a note of it in 1888 I should not have selected it for a character which I intended to be sparkling. The devil himself could not make a basset horn sparkle.''",1983-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Although clams are not universally found in all native waters, they are, in our minds, one of the most American of foods. In his estimable book, ''American Food'' (Vintage Books, 1981), Evan Jones notes that clam hash originated on the stoves of transplanted Easterners who immigrated to the West and were so disheartened to find themselves without corned beef that they replaced it with local clams, which they then turned into hash. Mr. Jones also speaks of the sentiment involved in a series of lines from a poem, ''The Old Settler'': ''I laugh at the world and its shams/ As I think of my pleasant condition/ surrounded by acres of clams.''",1983-05-29T05:00:00+0000

But they warned that any attempt to divide the West would fail. The statement, backed by all the seven nations, followed daylong discussions on its wording, taking up unexpected portions of the leaders' agenda. It left an impression of divisions at a conference intended to express economic solidarity and converging views. (Page 1, Column 6.) Control of six Syrian supply depots near Damascus was seized by rebel Palestinians Saturday as a mutiny spread within Yasir Arafat's Al Fatah organization. The opposing sides in the dispute gave differing accounts of the takeover of the six gasoline, food and truck centers. The pro-Arafat Palestinian press agency said ''alien armed elements'' had seized the depots, but a rebel spokesman said that their commanders had simply taken them over.
