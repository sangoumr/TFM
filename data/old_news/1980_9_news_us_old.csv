us,Film: Fassbinder on Terrorism:Terrible Toy,"THERE no longer can be any doubt about it: Rainer Werner Fassbinder is the most dazzling, talented, provocative, original, puzzling, prolific and exhilarating film maker of his generation. Anywhere. I say this based partly on ""The Third Generation,"" his 1979 German film that opens today at the Public Theater and which is one of his best. Mostly, though, I'm thinking of the 23 Fassbinder features I've seen (including ""Katzelmacher,"" ""The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,"" ""Effi Briest,"" ""Fox and His Friends,"" ""Despair,"" ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" and ""In a Year of 13 Moons"") of the 35 he has made since he turned to movies in 1965 at the age of 19.There hasn't been a comparable phenomenon in films since Jean-Luc Godard came on the scene in the early 60's.Mr. Fassbinder has demonstrated that he is quite capable of adapting his cinematic vision to fit the works of others (Fontane's ""Effi Briest,"" Nabokov's ""Despair""), but it's his original screenplays that give the true measure of this great, unpredictable talent. He makes movies the way other, lesser directors talk about them  easily, quickly and precisely. When he shoots a film, he is speculating about the subject as well as about the craft of film making, examining both as he goes along, freely, without being bound to arrive at some preset destination. His movies are the logbooks of an adventuring mind.Some Fassbinder films are, of course, less successful than others, but that's beside the point. Each is a part of what can now be recognized as a single continuing work, and if one film ends in something of a muddle, there's always another coming along that may clear things up. A Fassbinder movie isn't necessarily an end in itself. It's a way of thinking.Fassbinder films are so packed (visually and aurally) with information, references, asides, questions and unexpected connections (and, as a result so demanding) that most other contemporary movies look puny in comparison. Watching a good Fassbinder movie is like doing a double crostic after too many games of tick-tack-toe.""The Third Generation"" has you sitting on the edge of your seat even before you are sure what it's about. Scene: an elegant office high above a bustling city. We see a young woman, the secretary, watching a television set. A telephone rings. There's a mysterious, engimatic message: ""The world as will and idea."" Cut to a cheap hotel room. The secretary of the earlier sequence is just getting out of bed after an assignation with an older man, who turns out to be not only a police inspector, but also her father-in-law. Cut to a rich, bourgeois home where an old man argues with his grandson about movies and war. Cut to a classroom. A student objects to the way the teacher is imposing her partcular interpretation on history.In this way, Mr. Fassbinder introduces the more than half-dozen principal characters of ""The Third Generation,"" a cruel, sometimes very funny comedy about terrorism, a subject he has treated with a certain amount of sympathy in the past but one that he now ridicules in a way that implicates virtually everyone, from the members of the New Left straight across to those of the New Right.The film is about a cell of ""third generation"" terrorists, earnest, humorless, committed, largely middle-class boobs for whom terrorism has become a style of living without connections to political passions of any sort. They include Hilde (Bulle Ogier), the history teacher; Edgar (Udo Kier), a composer who doesn't compose very often; his wife, Susanne (Hanna Schygulla), the secretary; Rudolf Mann (Harry Baer), a clerk in a record store; Petra (Margit Castensen), a bored wife, and August (Volker Spengler), the always busy self-important leader of this particular cell of terrorists. They are small-timers with access to real explosives, and there's not a single coherent political idea among them.It's not by chance that whenever we see the conspirators, either singly or in various combinations, we always see a television set flickering somewhere in the vicinity. What ideas they do possess have arrived predigested, second- or third-hand, and have more to do with fashion than with intellect. They ridicule mercilessly a young man who comes into their midst with a suitcase loaded with books  books!  the weightier passages of which have been laboriously underlined with a pencil.These people are mutations, distant spinoffs of the members of the notorious Bader-Meinhof gang. They are people for whom political commitment is a matter of secret passwords, disguises and assumed names. Unknown to them, but apparent to the audience early on, is that they are being manipulated by a rich, influential businessman, played by the venerable Eddie Constantine, who orchestrates their activities to increase his sales and to frighten the Government into taking more repressive measures against the Left. The only character in the film who has the slightest suspicion about what's going on is the police inspector, played by Hark Bohm, who is himself an assassin of sorts.""The Third Generation"" is one of the richest looking and sounding films I've ever experienced. Like Mr. Godard, Mr. Fassbinder is extremely fond of printed titles, words seen on the screen as well as heard, and like Mr. Godard, he seems incapable of shooting a scene that isn't dense with detail, sometimes breathtakingly beautiful ones, which, in this case, serve to emphasize the deadly foolishness of the lives being lived in the foreground.One especially stunning sequence is layered in sound, like a pousse-caf meant to be heard rather than seen. As the conspirators meet to plan their next fruitless caper, we hear, simultaneously, two separate conversations, someone's reading from a book, a song being played on a guitar and sung, and the voice of a man on the television screen. As one sound is no more or less important than another, an assignment to rob a bank or blow up a public building is accepted with no more thought of its importance than a request to go out for cigarettes.The members of the Fassbinder ""stock company"" are in top form, and they're well complemented by Miss Ogier and Mr. Constantine. The photography, also by Mr. Fassbinder, recalls the ravishing work of Raoul Coutard when he was cameraman-in-residence to Mr. Godard.""The Third Generation"" is fascinating. It's also worrying. I keep wondering how long Mr. Fassbinder can continue this remarkable pace.",1980-09-09T05:00:00+0000

Anywhere. I say this based partly on ''The Third Generation,'' his 1979 German film that opens today at the Public Theater and which is one of his best. Mostly, though, I'm thinking of the 23 Fassbinder features I've seen (including ''Katzelmacher,'' ''The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,'' ''Effi Briest,'' ''Fox and His Friends,'' ''Despair,'' ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' and ''In a Year of 13 Moons'') of the 35 he has made since he turned to movies in 1965 at the age of 19.

Nicolas Roeg, who habitually structures his films this way, has again relied on jumbled time sequences, allusive cutting and a wealth of similar techniques to give ''Bad Timing/A Sensual Obsession'' its suggestive, secretive air. But ''Bad Timing,'' unlike Mr. Roeg's ''Performance,'' ''Walkabout,'' ''Don't Look Now'' and ''The Man Who Fell to Earth,'' has a ponderous, trumped-up feeling. It lacks the shimmer of Mr. Roeg's best work. And it manages to seem both weighty and insubstantial. ",1980-09-21T05:00:00+0000

It follows the adventures of Charlie and Neville, played by Charles Gormley and Neville Smith, as they scrape together the wherewithal to make a movie. Their search for a director leads them to the Edinburgh Film Festival, where they ask at the festival office whether Sam Fuller has arrived yet and are asked in turn, by a very dim and deadpan young employee, ''Is he Press?'' Eventually they recruit Wim Wenders. Mr. Wenders is one of a number of film-world denizens who make funny, good-natured appearances here. ",1980-09-22T05:00:00+0000

This edgy, halting drama is the portrait of a lonely woman, named Sylvia (Anne Raitt), who lives with a retarded sister (Sarah Stephenson) under the gloomiest circumstances imaginable. She works in a dreary accounting office -no improvement there - and has a suitor so timid he actually gasps with nervousness when it's time for him to speak. She also rents her garage to a jittery, disheveled young fellow who plays wretched renditions of American blues songs on his guitar.",1980-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Originally made as a television film and directed by Stephen Frears (known here for his one feature film, ''Gumshoe''), it moves gracefully and economically through a cool, forbidding world of the urban young. Mr. Frears's greatest accomplishments here are atmospheric, as he carefully sets the stage for this tale of a very modern crime. ",1980-09-23T05:00:00+0000

No one in ''Stardust Memories'' is exempt from the film's brand of acid humor, least of all Mr. Allen himself. It may seem, at least for a while, as if Mr. Allen is shooting only at sitting ducks: ''Stardust Memories'' is inhabited by grotesques, sycophants, every kind of fool, and when the film takes aim at any of them it easily hits its mark. But the principal target is Mr. Allen, who serves not just as the film's star, director and author but as its only real focus. ''Stardust Memories'' is after big game. ",1980-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Feldman is the star, director and co-author of ''In God We Trust'' (the dollar sign is dopey, but it does give you an idea of what Mr. Feldman is up to) and the temptations must have been enormous. The movie, which opens at the Rivoli and other theaters today, is about an innocent - a monk who leaves his cloister - who falls among religious hucksters. Then he meets God. Moreover, everything takes place in Los Angeles, so already you can see the temptations. Mr. Feldman could easily have choked on his own satirical sense. ",1980-09-26T05:00:00+0000
