Now, he has recreated one of his own restaurants, Pastis, moving it around the corner from the original and recycling tiles, mirrors and other vintage details that were kept in storage during its five-year hiatus. Even the phone number is the same. In building Pastis, Ive tried to capture the spirit of the original more than build a replica of it, Mr. McNally wrote in an email. This time around, he has a partner, the restaurateur Stephen Starr, a good thing because as hands-on as Mr. McNally can be, he had a stroke two years ago. Mr. McNally said that, despite the awful effects of the stroke, he is very much involved. He designed the restaurant and has been here constantly, Mr. Starr said. The larger space, which cost $8 million to build, is configured differently from the original. The money is on the art, media and fashion world to return. My ideal clientele would be layabouts, prostitutes and ex-cons, but well probably attract models, writers and a few judges, Mr. McNally said. The restaurant, which has already been besieged by reservation-seekers, will also attract people to the area, now home to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Line and top-shelf boutiques. About half of the menu is the same, serving escargots, onion soup gratine, salade nioise, steak-frites, mussels and, on Fridays, bouillabaisse. New dishes include herring with potatoes, duck with olives and boudin blanc sausages. This time, there is some seating at curved red leather banquettes  la Balthazar, another McNally hot spot. The chef, a Stephen Starr veteran, is Michael Abt. (Opens Friday) ",2019-06-04T16:58:29+0000

To shoot it, cinematographers (including Wyler) flew on bombing missions; one of them, a first lieutenant named Harold J. Tannenbaum, was killed in the process. Restored footage shot for The Memphis Belle has been arranged by the director Erik Nelson for The Cold Blue, a new documentary, which uses Wylers material to give an intimate sense of what life was like in a World War II bomber.

us,"T Suggests: English Roses, a Lost Film by Claire Denis and More","The photographer Luke Stephenson is a self-proclaimed nosy person. His curiosity has led him to capture some fairly esoteric subjects, like the parakeets (budgies) raised competitively among a subset of mostly older male Britons, and something called the Clown Egg Register, a collection of over 250 eggs painted to look like clowns and owned by Clowns International, a society established in London over half a century ago. Of his anthropological approach, Stephenson explains, I really enjoy the challenge of discovering the best people to speak to who can open the right doors. Recently, he trained his lens on the English rose, a flower bred by the renowned British horticulturist David Austin in the 1960s. Austin died earlier this year, but today, more than 150 strains of his English rose are commercially available, each with a name selected by Austin himself. David was always very fussy about the names he chose for his roses, explains Michael Marriott, the senior rosarian at David Austin Roses. He used to say that giving a rose a bad name was the easiest way to kill it. He liked to choose names that were very English, names that immediately evoked Britishness. The Anne Boleyn, the Dame Judi Dench and the Maid Marion are just a few of the varieties that appear in Stephensons new book, The English Rose. Each flower is documented in Stephensons signature style  a single specimen against a brightly colored backdrop  creating a pop version of an 18th-century nature Wunderkammer. Stephenson continues to focus on singularities of British culture because, he says, I have lived on this little island all my life, and I like to think I understand it, so I seek out these little oddities. I want to discover more. The English Rose is available to purchase at lukestephenson.com, with prints from the series available at the Photographers Gallery, 16-18 Ramillies Street, London, thephotographersgallery.org.

Throughout the film, co-written and directed by Cooper, we watch the two collaborate and fall in love. But as Allys music career soars, Jacksons falters. The film was chosen as a New York Times Critics Pick by Manohla Dargis, who wrote in her review: Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema.

As far as adherence to reality goes, Martin Scorseses new Bob Dylan story sits somewhere between Scorseses 2005 Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, and Solo: A Star Wars Story. In other words: Its loose with the facts. Theres tour footage shot in 1975 and more recent on-camera interviews with Dylan, Joan Baez, Sam Shepard and other real figures  the kind of things youd expect. But there are also some fictional characters mixed in, like a fake filmmaker (played by Martin von Haselberg) who we are told shot the tour footage. (In reality, the footage was shot for Dylans much-maligned 1978 film, Renaldo and Clara.) This coloring outside the lines of traditional documentary is fitting for a movie about Dylans Rolling Thunder Revue, a hectic parade through the northeastern United States and Canada that saw Dylan performing in offbeat venues like a mah-jongg parlor in Falmouth, Mass., with a band that included Baez, T Bone Burnett and, eventually, Joni Mitchell.",2019-06-12T05:00:09+0000

us,A Glimpse of Virginia Woolfs Original Manuscript for Mrs. Dalloway,"I am the only woman in England free to write what I like, Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary in 1925, the year she published her fourth novel. Thanks to a new reproduction of the only full draft of MRS. DALLOWAY (SP Books, $220), handwritten in three notebooks and initially titled The Hours, we now know that the story she completed  about a day in the life of a London housewife planning a dinner party  was a far cry from the one shed set out to write. The novel we know today begins with the iconic sentence Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. But a manuscript page dated June 1923 bears a different opening: In Westminster, where temples, meeting houses, conventicles, & steeples of all kinds are congregated together, there is at all hours & halfhours, a round of bells, correcting each other, asseverating that time has come a little earlier, or stayed a little later, here or here. Woolf began writing a big book about London after World War I, said Michael Cunningham, whose Pulitzer-winning novel The Hours was based on Woolfs. But she didnt go very far with that before she appears to have realized that the big book she thought she should write was not really the book she wanted to write. The transition for her was understanding that a book about an outwardly ordinary woman on an ordinary day in London could be every bit as big as the books about wars and revolutions. Rather than one of many minor threads, as Woolf initially planned, Mrs. Dalloways became the entire story.",2019-06-14T09:00:12+0000

Unfamiliar with business of any kind, he concocts a promotion in which four contestants will camp out on a platform in front of a billboard the station owns while the station broadcasts their squabbles. One could conceivably craft a Capra-esque, scrappy-underdog crowd-pleaser here, or a parable on the excesses of capitalism. But the movie misses both marks, widely.

Her eyebrows do a cartoonish slant from left to right, like an emoji meant to signal anger; her cheekbones, ordinarily sharp, soften whenever she purses her lips in disapproval, which is often. She wears a plain black robe with an ornate lace collar and occasionally slides on a pair of unrimmed glasses to look over legal documents. But all of it  the eyes, the brows, the lips, the face  has always been framed by a round pixie bob, virtually unchanged since the Clinton administration. So imagine my surprise when I walked into a ritzy hotel restaurant in Beverly Hills for my second meeting with Sheindlin  better known as Judge Judy  and found her wearing, for the first time, a clip-on ponytail.",2019-06-20T09:00:06+0000

Perhaps it was because she shifted her practice slightly later in life that she was able to make inventive work up until the end of it (the artist died last year). Shadows and Silhouettes, opening next week at David Kordansky Gallery, in Los Angeles, picks up about where the Met show left off, with 12 Woodman works that date from 2008 to 2016. Most compelling are those that combine painted canvas and glazed earthenware  its as though the clay elements of Woodmans imagined interiors refused to be merely depicted and decided to burst through the works surfaces. In Tuesday Afternoon (2016), a three-dimensional vase sits just in front of a canvas, its form echoed in the painting by a blank space like a cutout, or a phantom of what once was. Its a kind of mysterious move that started to crop up in some of the late paintings, says Stuart Krimko, the gallerys research and editorial director. The vessels become like characters, and the relationship between the vessel and the figure becomes more psychologically charged. ",2019-06-21T19:15:57+0000

The second debate will air Thursday, also at 9 p.m., on the same networks. It has perhaps the more starry showdown, with a pool that includes former Vice President Joseph R.

The couple replanted the long barren scrubland that surrounded the property with olive groves, cypress, fruit trees and lavender; they installed running water and electricity; and they decorated the interiors in a freewheeling mix of British and Tuscan styles, sourcing rustic Italian furniture from nearby junkyards and enlisting local artisans to fabricate antique-style iron bed frames for the five bedrooms.
