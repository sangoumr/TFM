Her eyes, emotional and direct, are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze-block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica. Smith, 31, made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures, a technique which evokes both the coming-of-age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat. It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one, Smith says of his images, as he walks toward the sole window in the work space, located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City, Missouri, where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute. Pinned to the white walls, and still in progress, are four of his signature picotages  his word for inkjet pigment prints layered with ornate architectural elements and mounted on museum board  which will go on display on April 4 as part of Junction, his first solo exhibition with the Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan.",2019-04-02T16:51:01+0000

Along one side of the island, the kitchen prepares sandwiches by day, and dinner entrees in the evening. All feature a choice of beef, turkey, salmon, pork or falafel. The food is high quality and well prepared, though the entrees could use better presentation than a cardboard tub.

(Or dont  and risk developing what one humor scientist has termed terminal seriousness.) In one of Hofmanns studies, subjects underwent two months of a well-known seven-step humor training program. Laughing at yourself was the penultimate step (what Hofmann calls Olympic level humor). Before trying it, first figure out what you think is funny and surround yourself with more of it. When its time to laugh at yourself, be prepared for an unpleasant task: You need to list the things you dont like about yourself  maybe youre insecure about your body or dislike your lisp. Arrange the list from least sensitive to most, then read it to someone before you start cracking jokes (researchers believe this vulnerability exercise greases the wheels for future levity). Next, come up with a few self-referential jokes about the less weighty stuff and eventually work your way up to the more painful things. Strategically desensitize yourself, Hofmann says.",2019-04-09T09:00:01+0000

Size, for one thing: Westeros is a sprawling continent, whereas the entire island of Ireland could fit snugly inside the state of Indiana. And the northern part of Westeros looked as if Britain had been clumsily grafted onto it. There was also the fact that Westeros did not technically exist  that it emerged fully formed in the mid-1990s out of the volcanic imagination of the American fantasy writer George R.R. Martin  and that Ireland and Britain technically did, though their borders persisted in a state of ontological flux. My curiosity about this cartographic relationship led me to enter the terms Ireland Westeros map into Google, where I learned that my observation was not an original one. Martin himself had confirmed as much in an interview at Comic-Con in 2014. Westeros began, he said, as upside-down Ireland.",2019-04-15T09:00:02+0000

Toward the rear of the shop is Huso, a 12-seat restaurant named for beluga (in Latin, huso huso), where the chef, Buddha Lo, an Australian who worked at Eleven Madison Park, prepares an all-day menu of small plates, like king crab with caviar in a lobster bun, Wagyu tartare with caviar, and caviar samplers with blini and buttery madeleines. In the evenings, starting next week, a multicourse tasting menu, $200, will be available. Markys is the work of Mark Zaslavsky and Mark Gelman, who started selling seafood, caviar and other imported specialties wholesale and retail, and opened a shop in Miami in 1983. By the late 1990s, they anticipated the restrictions on caviar from wild sturgeon that are now in place and set up an aquaculture operation dedicated to several species of sturgeon, including beluga, in northern Florida. This fall at their Sturgeon Aquafarms, they expect to be able to start producing beluga, for which they hold a government license and international certification. Their farming operation is also working with countries along the Caspian Sea to help restore the sturgeon population, especially for beluga. (Opens Wednesday)",2019-04-16T16:12:43+0000

Humans naturally do most of their breathing through their nasal passages, which serve to heat, humidify and filter the air. Its not uncommon, though, to slip into a mouth-breathing habit. Test yourself by inhaling through your nostrils. If you cant, you may have some kind of obstruction, and should go see an ear, nose and throat specialist. If you can but tend not to, you may be an accidental mouth breather.",2019-04-23T09:00:02+0000

Heigl didnt get to show the luminance, flintiness or idiosyncrasy of her romantic-comedy forebears; she was given too few moments of wit or insight. Instead, she was tough, stubborn, gainfully employed and  like most of the women in these movies, by that point  counterproductively heartless, tolerant of whatever partnership the plot backed her into.

But one recurring motif is the story of Walter Benjamin, the German Jewish philosopher and cultural critic who witnessed Europe being consumed by fascism. In Pajaks drawings, Benjamin experiences the maddened crowds, exiles himself to Ibiza and then Paris, and eventually commits suicide during a failed escape from the Continent. In an email, Pajak explained his fascination with the philosopher: The past has two faces: the past of the victors and the past of the vanquished, erased from history. But, history can only exist if the present repairs the trauma of the past. The injustice done to the victims of history must be repaired, even and especially if, as Benjamin wrote, it is more difficult to honor the memory of the nameless than that of the known.",2019-04-26T09:00:14+0000

us,Spring Gallery Guide: Chelsea,"Art and real estate development met elsewhere in the city, but they got married in Chelsea. Tall, expensive buildings are rising around 10th Avenue, and gallery rents are rising along with them. Young art dealers arrive to try their hand in the official gallery neighborhood, and often fold-up shop quickly, as the promisingly offbeat American Medium, which started in Brooklyn, did recently. The juggernaut of mega-gallery showrooms continues, with behemoths like Hauser & Wirth mounting impressive historical shows (and starting their own bookstores, publishing houses, magazines and nonprofit foundations), and David Zwirner is planning a Renzo Piano-designed space to open in 2020. Meanwhile, the High Line looms ubiquitously overhead, like a people mover transporting tourists (mostly) from the new Hudson Yards on the north end to the gleaming Whitney Museum of American Art on the south. Contemporary art is everywhere though, including the High Line, where youll find a monumental sculpture by Simone Leigh, who just opened a show at the Guggenheim, along with other notable displays. Art has saturated the neighborhood, and you can see everything from work by emerging artists to the long deceased. Here are a few places to start. ",2019-04-26T16:24:52+0000

It is probably home to the greatest number of starting-out dealers showing the works of emerging artists in New York. This gives the art scene in this neighborhood and the ones developing around it  in NoHo, East Village South, Chinatown or Little Italy  a certain lightness of being. Were often looking at first, not necessarily mature or final, artistic statements. It helps that the area lacks the dwarfing juggernaut of big-name, property-proud galleries and blue-chip artists that give Chelsea or the Upper East Side their weight. Most of the shows reviewed here emphasize youth in various forms.",2019-04-26T16:28:06+0000

He could have been describing the geography of New York City galleries. In the 1970s, the climates were macro and few (the Upper East Side, SoHo). In the 1980s, they were joined by the East Village; in the 1990s, by Chelsea; and in the 2000s, by the Lower East Side and Brooklyn. And there are spillovers everywhere. Today, it can be hard to tag a gallery by district, as I learned when visiting a handful that straddle either side of Canal Street, a cross-island axis that runs from SoHo to Chinatown, without claiming full allegiance to either.
