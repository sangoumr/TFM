us,BREAKING UP GOVERNMENT'S MONOPOLY ON PRISON CELLS,"WASHINGTON PRISON is a growth industry. The number of Americans behind bars has doubled to 663,000 in the past decade, and experts predict more than $7 billion will be spent on new facilities in the coming one. Sensing a market, private companies have begun to play a larger role in what has generally been a public function since the 19th century, when some states shipped convicts to entrepreneurs who used them as slaves on plantations and in factories. There are now about two dozen major correctional facilities under private ownership or operation. The newest, a 175-bed detention center for illegal aliens operated by the Corrections Corporation of America for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is to open next week in Laredo, Tex. The company also runs a 350-bed alien detention center in Houston, a 30-bed facility for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Fayetteville, N.C., and a 325-bed jail in Chattanooga, Tenn., whose inmates range from murderers to drunken drivers. Two brothers, Charles and Joseph Fenton, are building a $20 million, 715-cell maximum security penitentiary north of Pittsburgh. Last week, Martin Tolchin, a reporter in the Washington Bureau of The New York Times, asked two experts - James K. Stewart, director of the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, and Mark A.

us,  PORTRAIT OF A MILITARY LEGEND,"''American Caesar'' is a milestone of sorts - a five-hour documentary series devoted to one man, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and shown simultaneously over broadcast and cable television. It is adapted from William Manchester's superb biography, and, like the book, it doesn't demand that we approve of MacArthur, only that we respect him. It is possible he was the most gifted military man the United States has ever produced. Certainly he was one of the most controversial, although ''American Caesar'' assiduously tries to keep a perspective. Was MacArthur arrogant, willful and vain? He was. Was he also dedicated, honorable and conscientious? He was those things, too - ''a great thundering paradox of a man,'' the documentary asserts, who coveted both victory and authority, and could simultaneously despise and celebrate war. The series, jointly produced by Metromedia Television and the Turner Broadcasting System, begins tonight on WNEW-TV at 6 and on TBS at 8.",1985-03-03T05:00:00+0000

In its most common form tiramis u - literally, ''pick me up'' or ''lift me up'' - is made with mascarpone, the soft, buttery Italian double cream cheese, plus eggs, coffee, sugar, chocolate pieces and the Italian equivalent of ladyfingers, savoiardi. The biscuits are dipped in the coffee, the mascarpone mixed with the eggs and sugar. The play of textures and flavors seems particularly appealing to Americans. The variations may add zabaglione, almonds, whipped cream or any of a wide variety of spirits; some substitute cocoa for chocolate. Some chefs separate the eggs, mixing the yolks with the mascarpone and folding beaten whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it.

He displayed each doll in turn, noting regretfully that the G.I. Joe doll had shrunk from eleven inches to four inches. ''But as small as Joe is, he's still a macho guy,'' Mr. Murphy observed. ''Not like Ken here.'' Mr. Murphy lifted a Ken doll of the famous Ken-and- Barbie couple. ''Remember Ken?'' asked Mr. Murphy. ''Check out Ken's pink shirt, all right? Check out the way he combs his hair. And look at his posture.'' Mr. Murphy adopted an admonitory tone. ''Moms and Dads, unless you want your sons to live in the 'Village' and skip to work, keep them as far away from Ken as possible, all right?'' Wild hilarity and applause.

The authors, Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth, offered a satirical view of the future in the mode of Aldous Huxley's ''Brave New World'' and George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' but in a lighter vein. The world of ''The Space Merchants'' was dominated not by ideologues or technocrats or warlords but by advertising agencies. A vast population of consumers was kept under control by methods of persuasion that seemed only slightly in advance of the bag of tricks Madison Avenue was already using. For example, there was the ''spherical trust.'' Interlocking chains of addiction - induced by special additives and psychological conditioning - insured that a consumer, once hooked, would remain loyal to the products sold by a particular conglomerate. A few mouthfuls of Crunchies began the chain reaction. ''The Crunchies kicked off withdrawal symptoms that could be quelled only by another two squirts of Popsie from the fountain. And Popsie kicked off withdrawal symptoms that could only be quelled by smoking Starr Cigarettes, which made you hungry for Crunchies.''",1985-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Susman argues in this brilliant and insightful volume of essays, has been between the values of production and consumption, work and leisure, saving and spending, between the old Puritan culture of frugality and the consumer culture of abundance. Mr. Susman locates the battle's turning point in the 1920's. A practitioner of the new social history would labor long and hard to measure which groups of Americans experienced the transition and when.

First, let us try to dispose of the tiresome old argument about whether ''Porgy'' is an opera, a debate that dates from the premiere 50 years ago and makes sense only if the word opera is defined so rigidly that it loses all meaning historically. Opera can and does embrace everything from Poulenc's one-woman show, ''La Voix Humaine,'' to ''Aida'' with live elephants, from masque to staged oratorio.

Perhaps most impressively, throughout this book, Mrs. Livingston looks closely and analytically at texts written by children, both those of child geniuses of the past and of participants in the creative writing programs in many schools today. What, she asks, are the strengths and weaknesses of children as poets? What are their natural proclivities and capabilities?

A media-child weaned on television, movies and news magazines, his multichannel skills include drawing, sculpture, performance art, video, film and music (he used to man the guitar in a rock band).

Fame and Fortune are not twin sisters in the Soviet literary world. One reaches a certain level of Soviet fortune by being promoted ideologically. In other words, one becomes a bearer of infamy rather than fame. Genuine literary fame in the Soviet Union often brings nothing but trouble; therefore, success in Soviet literature always creates a feeling of complicity - either against the bureaucratic ruling class or for it.

The Soviet Union remains an amalgam of secretive bureaucracies, its policies shaped by a collective of old men. Survivors of Stalin's tyranny, they revile even hints of one-man rule, the brash adventurism of a Nikita Khrushchev.

And would Franco Zeffirelli deliver another of his chic, overdressed spectacles disguised as an opera production? (Yes, oh my, yes.) Miss Behrens sang admirably in her own exciting style, with the bright tone and house-filling penetration that we have come to expect of this artist. The voice, however, tended to hit individual notes precisely and then let them go, rather than connecting them in legato phrases.

I can only reaffirm that: We do not strive to acquire unilateral advantages over the United States, over NATO countries, for military superiority over them; we want termination, and not continuation of the arms race and, therefore, offer a freeze of nuclear arsenals, an end to further deployment of missiles; we want a real and major reduction of the arms stockpiles, and of the development of ever new weapon systems, be it in space or on earth. We would like our partners in the Geneva negotiations to understand the Soviet Union's position and respond in kind. Then agreement will be possible. The peoples of the world would sigh with relief. - From a speech yesterday to the Communist Party Central Committee after being appointed General Secretary.",*,1985-03-12T05:00:00+0000

The term seems to fit Greece's Socialist Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, who provokes ominous passions for mean gains. How tempting for the United States to fire back in kind at each outrageous salvo. And how easy to overdo it.","Mr. Papandreou's latest shocker is the humiliation of President Constantine Caramanlis, the principled conservative who restored Greek democracy after the colonels were ousted in 1974. Just days ago, the Prime Minister encouraged the belief that he would support a second five-year term for the President in a parliamentary vote on Sunday. But Mr. Papandreou reversed himself, and the 77-year-old President has withdrawn. The Socialist candidate to succeed him is a judge, Christos Sartzetakis, who has evidently agreed to yield the few real powers the President possesses.",1985-03-14T05:00:00+0000

Birds, animals, fissures in the earth, fish in the sea, flowers in meadows, trees on savannahs - striking images flourish. They exist in our minds as a great montage. A ''National Geographic Special'' reminds us of a ''Nature,'' which, in turn, touches the same chord as a ''Living Planet.'' Granted that ''The Living Planet'' is grander, and that it deals in majesty. The rubric is the same: The world is a wondrous place, full of enchantment, but often in peril. Pandas, whooping cranes, rain forests and salt marshes, whole swaths and spectrums of life, are threatened. Nature programs sound warnings, although as a rule they say that help is on the way. They alarm and comfort us simultaneously. At the same time, they almost always look good. Consider ''Rhino on the Run,'' the ''Nature'' episode on Channel 13 at 8 tonight. The rhinoceros is a singularly unlovely beast, but here he doesn't look bad. Moreover, he is endangered, but good people stand ready to protect him.",1985-03-17T05:00:00+0000

Real people - meaning fathers, brothers, husbands, boyfriends and neighbors - had dark suits, white shirts and black shoes, chinos and loafers, flannels and blazers, and formal evening clothes, a wardrobe that covered every occasion. The one touch of masculine glamour (at least it seemed so to the big-city people who came up our way) was a raccoon coat, which came in mighty handy when the temperature dropped to 30 below and the wind, which we hoped was en route to the United States, howled over the prairie like a sick timber wolf.

us,  ANGLER'S ROOST A LURE TO THE END,"BEDFORD VILLAGE, N.Y. ritt BuLIKE salmon resting momentarily in their upstream spawning run, a large crowd of eager devotees of angling, its equipage and its literature, milled in front of Bedford Historical Hall shortly after dawn Friday, waiting for the doors to open at 8. The occasion was the start of a two-day tag sale and auction of the contents of the late Jim Deren's Manhattan-based Angler's Roost, an establishment whose siren call to anglers from all over the world belied its cramped quarters. Part of the public's fascination with the affair - the earliest customers, John and Maureen Liberati of White Plains, were on hand at 5:20 A.M., and by noon about 500 more had followed them inside - is a tribute to Mr. Deren's reputation as a first-class angler, raconteur and salesman. Also responsible is a burgeoning interest in collecting antique fishing gear. Only a small percentage of the material at the sale could properly be called old or antique, but the possibility of such a find clearly brought many to the hall, which is an antique itself. Formerly a church at Bedford Four Corners, it was hauled to its present location in 1837 by 20 yoke of oxen. The hall was filled with an astonishing array of rods, reels of all types, fly lines, old fishing magazines and books, canvas and wicker creels, leaders, waders, trout and salmon flies, fly-tying materials and vises, fresh- and saltwater lures, knives, arrows, bows, filing cabinets, fly books and boxes, studs for wading shoes, shirts, jackets, foul-weather gear, fishing caps and a few undistinguished cork-bodied duck decoys. The Angler's Roost was first situated at 207 East 43rd Street, then in the Chrysler Building and, finally, at 141 East 44th Street near Grand Central, where Mr. Deren held forth until shortly before his death in 1983. Space was limited in each of those locations. At the last place, one felt crowded if more than two other customers were present. The room was jammed with fishing gear, in the midst of which Mr. Deren presided, usually in a sitting position. Frequent visitors to the shop were aware that much more stuff was stored in large back rooms, but they could only conjecture what was there. Admitting that they and their co- workers were overwhelmed by the number of items unearthed, the key people in organizing the event, Hoagy Carmichael Jr. and Judith Bowman, both of Bedford, N.Y., speculate that. for many, part of the appeal of the sale and auction was the long-awaited chance (an angler's most valuable trait is patience) to finally see what was in those other rooms. Although there were hundreds of valuable items and splendid bargains - salmon and trout flies fly rods and fly-line reels notable among the last-named - in Friday's tag sale, most of the truly choice and expensive items were disposed of in yesterday's auction. They included handmade split bamboo rods by such legendary makers as Edmind Garrision, E. F. Payne, Harold (Pinky) Gillum and Hiram Leonard. The auctioneer, Paul Wight of Plattsburgh, N.Y., had a somewhat unresponsive audience with the beginning items - old magazines and catalogues - but the bidding picked up when books and trout and salmon flies went on the block. In one instance, a single Whirling Dun trout fly sold for $90. The bidding for reels was spirited. A Hardy 12/0 Zane Grey big game reel went for $2,000. Handmade split bamboo fly rods also fetched handsome prices. An 8-foot Garrison was purchased for $1,900. Among those who traveled the farthest to get to the sale was Art Warner, who described himself as ""a trout-fishing nut from Southern California."" ""When I told some friends that I was taking some time off for a trip, they assumed it was an angling adventure and were astonished to find that I was flying to New York City,"" Mr. Warner said. ""Although I grew up in Binghamton, N.Y., I never had the good fortune to meet Mr. Deren, but, of course, I knew of him."" As he spoke - he had already bought more than $100 worth of gear - he was fondling a leather case for a revolving-spool reel. Another customer, Frank Almquist, of Woodstock, N.Y., had visited the Angler's Roost. Mr. Almquist, who is the president of the Catskill Mountain Chapter of Trout Unlimited, and his wife, Wendy, had purchased a seven-foot South Bend split bamboo fly rod, 15 boxes of dry fly hooks down to No. 26, which are so tiny a sneeze would send dozens of them flying, and a bag full of fly-tying materials, including an excellent blue dun saddle hackle and a good supply of wood duck feathers. The lure of the Angler's Roost to fishermen who either lived in or visited Manhattan was intense. In his ""Catskill Rivers,"" published shortly before Mr. Deren's death, Austin Francis said that the Angler's Roost ""is the only decent tackle shop left in Manhattan that caters to Catskill anglers."" Some of Mr. Deren's fishing companions recall that as he grew older (he was in his 60's when he died) he was possessed by the fascination of what is difficult and would devote the better part of a day, sometimes unsuccessfully, in working a fly over the lairs of truly large and wise trout, while smaller and less sophisticated fish nearby would hit almost anything. Those who visited his shop included Presidents or their emissaries, captains of industry from this country and abroad and figures from the world of entertainment and sports, Ted Williams among the last-named. NMr. Carmichael expressed astonishment at the interest in the liquidation. ""It's incredible,"" he said, ""If you announced that you had five union suits once worn by George LaBranche, you'd have 100 buyers in 24 hours."" Mr. LaBranche is the famous Catskill fly-tyer who was a key figure in adapting the techniques practiced on England's sedate streams to their turbulent American counterparts. The aforementioned $90 Whirling Dun was tied by Mr. LaBranche. - OUTDOORS",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

By attaching these questions to the details of femininity and extending her description through an extraordinary range of historical example and literary illustration, Miss Brownmiller has turned a treacherous subject into a lively and compelling book.''",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

Cookie came in costume. Perfectly pressed chinos, sweatshirt rolled meticulously above the elbows, and the right sneakers: Spaldings for a while, because that was what the guys wore at Loughlin and St. Ann's and Madison and Jeff, and then Converse, when they somehow seized the market, and you weren't a ballplayer if you didn't have a pair. High-tops, low-cuts, white, black - Cookie maintained a full selection. He changed them with his mood, his fantasies. When he had his black low-cuts on, Cookie used to elbow and scramble, his being transmogrified into Jim Loscutoff, the Celtics brawler. White high-tops meant a different persona: Cookie would flop around shouting, ''Ron Bontemps, the bounding Ron Bontemps,'' his brain filled with incantation, certain it could will his body some grace. Ron Bontemps was a thin blond who played for Beloit in the Garden once and left an imprint on Cookie. He was less a person than a concept, and Cookie, like a man disguised in a suit of feathers and flapping his wings, must have thought that if he dressed like Bontemps and howled his name, he could fly too.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"  FOR THE WOMEN, STILL A LONG WAY TO GO","Although a gowing number of young women are studying the quantitatively-based disciplines that prepare them for careers in science, engineering and computer science, their prospects for employment and advancement in industry and academia drag woefully behind those for men. ''Ten years ago, many us thought that merit would be recognized and rewarded in these fields regardless of a person's gender, but we've been proved totally wrong,'' said Betty Vettor, Executive Director of the Scientific Manpower Commission, ''I don't expect opportunities to equalize within the next twenty years,'' she added. Still, Dr. Vettor and others point out, women have been making inroads into scientific, engineering and computer fields. Between 1965 and 1982 (the latest year for which figures are available), there was a 10 percent increase in the number of women majoring in the physical and life sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science, according to ''The Professional Women and Minorities'' report of the Scientific Manpower Commission. On the graduate level, the growth was somewhat higher: a 12 percent increase in master's degrees and a 15 percent increase in doctoral degrees. These increased percentages do not, however, point to a change in women's preferences about career fields, according to Sue E. Berryman, a resident consultant with the Rand Corporation in Washington, D.C. They simply reflect the growing representation of women in all fields in college. ''As long as girls expect to assume the major child-rearing responsibilities of their families, they will be less likely than boys to choose quantitative occupations that require major educational and labor force commitments,'' said Dr. Berryman, who conducted the study, ''Who Will Do Science?'' for the Rockefeller Foundation.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,THE HARSH VOICE OF THE FRENCH RIGHT,"What will make Jean- Marie Le Pen and his racist National Front go away? These days, after the party's showing in the French regional elections over the past two Sundays, there are not many promising answers for those whom the question worries. For the time being at least, the party has a bit of unpleasant sociology working for it, and the good possibility of riding into the National Assembly next year under a proportional representation plan that President Fran,cois Mitterrand is expected to write into an electoral reform bill. In the regional contest, Mr. Le Pen did somewhat less well than he might have liked, electing only one regional council member, Jean Roussel, who was fined last week for signing a racist leaflet in a southern district. But Mr. Roussel could point to the more than 8 per cent of the electorate that backed his candidates. Amid much vague rhetoric, the Front's single unmistakable thesis is that immigrants, essentially Arabs and Africans, are equivalent to crime and disruption, and should be sent home. The rest of the party line appears to depend on the audience; it can include anti-Semitic innuendo, the Vichy regime's gospel of family, work and nationhood or talk of denationalizing French industry. A worrisome aspect of the National Front is that it is more than a remake of the traditional extreme right in France.

NOBODY PLASTIC IS ALIEN TO HIM","Duane Hanson's extraordinarily lifelike sculptures - of washerwomen, football players, janitors - provoke astonished reactions in viewers, who frequently walk past them several times before realizing they are inanimate. Two questions usually follow this realization: But is it art? And how does he do it? In DUANE HANSON (Abrams, Cloth, $37.50, Paper, $16.95), Kirk Varnedoe, an associate professor of art history at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, tries to answer both questions. An interview with the sculptor, in which he explains his artistic goals, and Mr. Varnedoe's thoughtful introduction, linking Mr. Hanson's work to the traditions of realist art, persuasively recommend the sculptor for more serious critical consideration than he has thus far received. There is also an illustrated step-by-step guide in which Mr. Hanson explains his method of working. After taking plaster casts from a human model and filling the casts with a polyester resin mixture, he solders together the body parts, retouches the whole and paints it a flesh tone. He then injects hair in clumps into the figure's ''skin,'' paints in features and dresses the sculpture with the appropriate accessories. Some 60 color illustrations of Mr. Hanson's work - most in private collections and museums - from the last two decades demonstrate his developing mastery of this technique, as well as a steady shift in focus. From overtly political subjects in the late 1960's and early 70's - a war scene, a race riot - he has turned to more subtle commentary on the quality of lower-middle-class American life.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

When Peter Nichols's play, ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,'' first appeared on Broadway 17 years ago, that seemed a pretty gruesome contradiction. The critics, though generally appreciative, were clearly nervous about the play, as were its producers; they sold it to the New York public as a vehicle for the leading man, Albert Finney, sometimes omitting to mention its author's name in advertisements. The result was inevitable. ''The theater was packed every performance for 11 weeks,'' remembers Mr. Nichols, ''but then Albert left the cast, and the audiences simply disappeared.''

The esthetic assumptions of the 18th and 19th centuries imposed their limits on the interpretations of Shakespeare offered by Dr. Johnson or Coleridge, but those readings are alert to truths we may have forgotten. There is no guarantee that our readings of Shakespeare will seem any less limited to our grandchildren, who will reinterpret him for the 21st century and who will doubtless uncover aspects of his art to which we are blind. Coming generations will also be listening to Bach and remaking him in the image of their own time, though whether they will normally hear his music on synthesizers or antique instruments remains an open question. Perhaps they will even engage in loving reconstructions of the 19th-century style of Bach playing now thought to be discredited. Whatever their practice, Bach will survive it, as Shakespeare has survived all kinds of distorting productions. Unlike his lesser contemporaries - composers like Couperin or Telemann - Bach transcends his time and place.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

There are no major changes in store, but there are some differences from the recent past. One is that Mr. Cunningham has taken himself out of some works in which he used to dance, such as ''Duets.'' Another change is the number of new faces, replacing dancers who have departed. Even the size of the company - 16 members including Mr. Cunningham - is larger by old Cunningham standards although it reached this level a few seasons ago. There are also two new ''artistic advisors,'' William Anastasi and Dove Bradshaw - which means two new painters to create the decor, costumes and lighting. There is finally, a discernible change in the choreography - not through any compositional process but in the fact that Mr. Cunningham's role, or his absence, determines the final outcome, how the piece finally coheres before the viewer.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

A memorable example was the delay in construction of the Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River to protect a small fish called the snail darter. But the controversy has waned in recent years, in part because of a widening recognition of what is at stake - not simply the existence of a few rare creatures with names like the rhizome fleabane and the last chance townsendia, but the health of the biological systems that those creatures share with other species, including human beings. ''The Endangered Species Act is not concerned with esoterica, with odd names or with fossils about to go extinct,'' says Thomas E. Lovejoy, vice president of the World Wildlife Fund - U.S. ''We are talking about protecting the earth in all its variety, about the basis of biological science and about the ecological services that make life possible.'' A measure of how far the country has come in accepting the need for that sort of protection is the relative absence of opposition as Congress takes up reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. There were no fireworks this month at the opening of Congressional hearings on extending the law, which expires this year. Instead, the Reagan Administration recommended that it be continued for four more years without change.",1985-03-24T05:00:00+0000

So it was no surprise to find his program last night at Carnegie Hall starting off with a concert version of Schoenberg's nerve- shredding essay in Expressionist agony, ''Ewartung.''

Israel has a dual goal in Lebanon: to withdraw its military in an orderly fashion (although it does not intend to have the pace of the pullback dictated by terror) and to secure its northern border. This second concern - to protect the Galilee region, home to 10 percent of the country's population, from Katyusha-rocket attacks and other shelling from Lebanon - was, of course, the principal aim of the Israeli invasion in 1982.",1985-03-28T05:00:00+0000

For a while, the pain of the Vietnam experience was such that Americans suffered a collective repression. Now there seems to be a willingness to examine this chapter in our past. What is Vietnam's legacy in America? To find out, The New York Times asked a team of reporters to examine how the Vietnam experience affects our everyday life, our high art and popular culture, and the veterans who fought the war.

The latest word is notably inexact, since most of the people it designates are different shades of brown, sometimes very light. (It is, to be sure, no more inexact than the word ''white'' applied to a spectrum of faces from pinko-gray to swarthy.)

Regardless of whether the continued use of the term la isla betrays underlying political attitudes, the fact remains that more and more Puerto Rico has come to be divided into the San Juan metropolitan area, now encompassing roughly one-third of the island's population, and the rest of Puerto Rico. The overwhelming majority of the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit Puerto Rico every year never step out of San Juan, thus missing most of the still unspoiled and most attractive areas the .island has to offer.",1985-03-31T05:00:00+0000

us,  A COLLECTOR INTENT ON PRESERVING AN ERA,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. h One of the world's most diligent pursuers of contemporary art, Richard Brown Baker has given new meaning to the word ""eclectic."" Covering the scene for more than 30 years, he's zeroed in like a talent scout on artists of every persuasion, largely buying the work of the new and unknown, and not selling, no matter how euphoric the market. Jackson Pollock and Teruko Yokoi, Louise Nevelson and Theo Wujcik, Willem de Kooning and Sarah Supplee are among the names in Mr. Baker's collection, and if it lacks what's fancily called ""a profile,"" it has both quality and quantity - more than 1,200 objects so far - comprising a very useful chronological survey of big tides and little ripples from World War II to date. Two ingredients compound the Baker formula: fiscal credit and confidence in his eye, and with it he's gone from amateur status in the sport to full-time professional. Parts of his holdings have often been shown, but the biggest and most comprehensive selection from it ever - more than 160 works - is now on view at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, here in Mr. Baker's old home town (through April 28; then on to the West Coast). Set out cheek by jowl with period furniture and Old Master paintings in this small but eloquent teaching museum, the exhibition includes the most important Baker holdings - Jackson Pollock's ""Arabesque"" (1948), Franz Kline's ""Wanamaker Block"" (1955), Hans Hofmann's ""Fortissimo"" (1956), Roy Lichtenstein's ""Blam"" (1962), among others - and a supporting cast chosen to give an overall impression of the collection's international range as well as its diversity of mediums and approaches. The eye is not always unfailing - for one, by my lights there's too much in the way of the bland non-style known as Photo-Realism - but Mr. Baker obviously didn't set out to ""shape"" his holdings. Instead, while buying to please himself, he seems to have a mission to preserve the period, making what he calls his ""study"" collection as representative as possible of the art world in the middle years of our century. ""My collecting approach has been chronological - new work as it comes out,"" he says. Acknowledging with a smile that ""self-interest and vanity"" may play a part in his acquisitionship, Mr. Baker also likes to think he is helping artists ""become known to as broad a public as possible. I believe they need a wide basis of support, and private collectors are as necessary as museums to their well-being in an economic and emotional sense."" He intends to leave the collection to his alma mater, Yale (where part of it is already housed), and the Rhode Island School of Design museum. ""One reason why I don't sell is that I feel the scene should be available to the future. The collection might be interesting for people looking back to the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. They may remember de Kooning, but not lesser lights. In our own period, we see all sorts of artists who'll be forgotten later."" Yet, as he points out, there are big gaps - no works by Rothko, Francis Bacon or Clyfford Still, for instance - gaps that he says he doesn't ""feel obliged to fill. After all, I'm not an institution."" Often, when he would like to follow an artist's career to full peak, success will drive prices too high for what Mr. Baker calls his ""limited means."" An example is Roy Lichtenstein: though Mr. Baker was one of the first to buy his work on canvas in the early 60's, by the 80's he could afford to purchase only the artist's prints. On the other hand, a current heavy, Julian Schnabel, is not in the collection at all. ""By the time I'd heard of him, his paintings were already $80,000,"" says Mr. Baker. The collection had its genesis in the late 1940's when Mr. Baker, then a foreign affairs specialist for the State Department in Washington, ""retired"" early on a private income to try his hand at writing. Arriving in New York in late 1952, he began to make the round of galleries, and took to the young, postwar generation of abstract artists. With the idea that it would ""helpful and challenging to buy the work of the living, the young and unestablished,"" he began making serious acquisitions and one of his very earliest purchases (on view in the show) was a tiny collage by Kurt Schwitters, bought in 1954 from the Museum of Modern Art's Art Lending Service for $250. Two years later, he had already acquired Pollock's now classic ""Arabesque,"" Jean Dubuffet's strong and witty ""Winter Landscape With Two Dogs"" (both pictures for under $5,000), Kline's powerful ""Wanamaker Block,"" and an ardent Calder whimsicality, ""A Mobile With a Stabile Tail"" (1947). And then he was off and running, branching out as trend succeeded trend, occasionally piling as many as 70 purchases in a single year. A tour of the two gallery floors that hold the collection in this small museum gives the viewer a luxurious chance to pit his own taste against Mr. Baker's. Agreed, the Pollock and the Kline are two superb choices, worthy of great museums. No less rewarding are the two Hans Hofmann paintings, ""Pond"" and ""Fortissimo,"" the former a cool, muted body of green between shores of riotous color; the latter a gorgeous, ordered explosion of brushstrokes that lifts the eye upward. ""Aerial,"" a serenely surreal canvas by William Baziotes, is at the top of that artist's form. A dazzling treatise in black and white is offered by Al Held's infinitely polished ""Volta VIII,"" with its ballet of geometric forms traced in white against a flat black ground, and Cy Twombly's nearby ""Untitled,"" scribbled white rectangles deployed with graffiti-like ease against a backdrop of black. William Beckman's steely ""Self Portrait,"" a puritanical figure against a seductively taffy-colored gessoed ground, is as fine an example of contemporary Realism as anything around. A wonderful charcoal drawing of a reclining nude by Jules Olitski makes one wish for more figurative work from this echt abstractionist. Not to be dismissed lightly, either, is the sense of humor that Mr. Baker brings to his calling. It's especially apparent in such works as Robert Arneson's ceramic sculpture ""The Last Gasp,"" a portrait of the artist as a red- faced swimmer, mouth open like a fish, perched atop a Roman column (and installed in a gallery under a flossy, putti- filled 18th-century painting by Gian Battista Tiepolo). On the other hand, one could carp at more than a few of Mr. Baker's selections, and wonder why he rushed to buy so much, perhaps at the expense of better. The small Nevelson wall piece, for instance, is certainly not representative of that artist at her best, and Kenneth Noland's big, target-like ""Rhyme"" shows us the weaker side of Noland's work. Lucas Samaras's recent baroque sculpture has seemed to me not one of his finest efforts, and the small piece here reinforces that opinion, especially in context with other Samarases in the show. One has seen better contributions from Dorothea Rockburne than her drawing ""Triangle, Small Square,"" and one wishes that less slick examples could be found from the current Neo-Expressionist scene than Leonard Koscianski's ""Hunting Ground."" Yet if there's such a thing as an auteur collector, Mr. Baker is it. Looking at the larger, overall scope of his efforts, we can be glad that someone of taste and spirit was around to save so much of the present for the future. - GALLERY VIEW",1985-03-31T05:00:00+0000

Two of them made forays into southern New Jersey, the political base that gave Mr. Florio an easy victory over 12 other Democrats in the gubernatorial primary in 1981. The day after Mr. Florio's announcement, Peter Shapiro, the Essex County Executive, visited a child-care center at the Camden YWCA. By the end of the week, former United States Attorney Robert J. Del Tufo had moved his campaign into Gloucester and Cape May Counties. Former State Senator Stephen B. Wiley and Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark were also setting their sights south of Trenton.

What brought it back was an encounter there with a young soldier who seemed as eager for action as Denton himself had been when he took command of his first platoon in Bravo Company, Seventh Engineer Battalion, at Danang, South Vietnam, in 1966. Denton, now an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, hadn't realized that soldiers like that were still being turned out. Trying to express how moved and transfixed he felt when he saw the young man, Denton described a vision: ''He was 21, if that, and he took me right back to what I was. He was ready, and he was going to do it, almost to the point of saying, 'I sure hope they've got a war going someplace.' It made me feel good, but at the same time I wanted to go over and put my arm around him and say, 'Hey, have you got about five minutes? I want to tell you a few things.' '' Denton never had that conversation. If he had spoken, he would have talked, he said, about the responsibilities rather than the glory of command, about the strength a leader derives from his men, about devotion to them as an element of valor.",1985-03-31T05:00:00+0000
