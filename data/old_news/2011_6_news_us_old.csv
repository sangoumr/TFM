Channsin Berry and Bradinn French, Dark Girls takes a compelling look at the impact of colorism: a state of prejudice, conscious and unconscious, that causes both black people and white people to label as more beautiful or desirable or intelligent individuals with lighter shades of skin, particularly when it comes to black women. Few among people of color are unfamiliar with the saying: If you are light, you are all right. If you are brown, you can stick around. If you are black, get back. A writer in The Washington Post aptly described the phenomenon a few years ago as the crazy aunt in the attic of racism.",2011-06-01T10:31:37+0000

Reader, I did all of these things over the course of a day during Cannes. But at least let me explain. I was staying at the Hotel Martinez, which, for those unaware, becomes so brimming with celebrities (from Vanessa Hudgens to Sarah Jessica Parker) during the film festival that every paparazzo in the world, and possibly the entire population of the South of France, hold vigil outside, cameras pointed at the door until they realize you are not, in fact, Clemence Poesy (thanks, though!). So when sharing an elevator with Jude Law, whether coming from the seventh floor gym or la plage across the street, is a real possibility, being caught barefaced is a bit daunting. As for my sleeping in makeup, blame Olivier Zahm and his Purple party at Le Baron, an early flight and the lack of the will to painstakingly remove the waterproof makeup I agreed to test for The Moment.

The battle is especially pitched on the little hillock dominated by the pavilions of Britain (Mike Nelson), Germany (Christoph Schlingensief) and France (Christian Boltanski), although the fray has also been joined by Switzerland (Thomas Hirshhorn) and the Czech Republic. At that pavilion, a little-known artist named Dominik Lang, barely 30 years old, has mounted a strangely affecting time-capsule-like installation featuring a great deal of generic postwar figurative sculpture by his father, Jiri Lang (1927-1996), who stopped making art years before his son was born. It serves as a sobering reminder of the obscurity that awaits most of the art produced at any given point in time, as well as the ability of art objects, being objects, to wait out different phases of neglect.",2011-06-01T14:44:11+0000

The results include a dappled goatskin boucl cardigan that is as pleasing to the touch as it is to the eye  and that still leaves enough to the imagination.

A transparent overlay between the two shots shows you how and where to apply makeup, which is very effective. Seeing the outline of the shape you are trying to create helps you apply product in a more accurate, efficient way.

Although Teen Wolf did well at the box office all those years ago, this current and rather astonishing flurry of attention and examination would certainly have been welcome on opening day. I believe that with any film, it is up to the filmmaker to put forth his or her story, and it is then up to the audience to ascribe motivations and meaning. Having said that, I thought you might be interested in a few of my intentions while directing the film. To me, this was never a film about a werewolf. It was about a normal kid fighting his way through puberty, girls, peer pressure, school, etc., who has a bomb dropped on him at the end of Act I. For me, the key scene in the film occurs when Scott, Michael J. Foxs character, reveals the wolf for the first time in public, during a basketball game.

Janusz brings them to Ipswich, to the small house and garden that give the novel its title. There Silvana forces herself to believe that a normal life is possible: that she and Janusz will rediscover themselves as husband and wife, that Aurek will have a father  and that the secret still threatening her sons security will stay buried.",2011-06-03T17:13:48+0000

us,Checking It Twice,"Whether youre simply organized or mildy compulsive, a list can provide the structure for the everyday. However, when the to-do list is compiled by such artistic luminaries as Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder and Franz Kline, it transcends its ostensible purpose and provides insights into the life and times of its maker. This is obvious from a new show  To-dos, Ilustrated Inventories, Collected Thoughts, and Other Artists Enumerations, curated by Liza Kirwin from the Smithsonians Archives of American Art  that opened today at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan. For example, Pablo Picassos recommendations for inclusion in the 1913 Armory Show, the first international exhibition of modern art in the United States, astutely foresaw the historical importance of Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger and Juan Gris. Franz Klines shopping list for booze for his 1960 New Years party was evidence of his financial success (it was a hefty bill for the time) as well as his social nature. The artist Adolf Konrad illustrated his 1962 packing list: Khaki trench. Check. Six pairs of socks. Check. Sunglasses. Check. Two lemons. Check.

Koch Theater for its 2011-12 season in an effort to increase ticket revenue by 5 to 10 percent, the companys spokesman, Robert Daniels, said in a telephone interview. City Ballet, whose dancers include, at left, Robert Fairchild and Teresa Reichlen, is not simply raising prices. Instead, it is offering a wider range of prices within each section, with some seats becoming more affordable and others more expensive. For example, seats in the orchestra, which in the 2010-11 season have ranged from $85 to $100, will now be $26 to $119. (Orchestra seats for American Ballet Theater performances at the Metropolitan Opera House run $30 to $102.) Seats in the third ring, formerly $50 or $60, will now range from $26 to $103.

A statement from Live Nation said Mr. McCartneys performance at Yankee Stadium can safely be predicted to feature some nearly three hours of the worlds best loved and most known music, with hits, deep cuts and surprises spanning his unrivaled career, including the 2008 album Electric Arguments that he released under the name the Fireman.

Drawing her bow, she seems to be aiming at the silhouetted figure of a man far away down a long hallway. In this, like so many of Mr. Erwitts images, the light humor thinly veils poetic profundity. A modern cipher of a man is about to get his comeuppance from a mythical divinity: Diana, the virginal huntress, the sight of whom makes men fall prey to the hounds of their own lust. As the sex scandals reported almost daily in the news media attest, many powerful men have suffered, metaphorically, the fate of that unlucky voyeur Actaeon. ",2011-06-09T21:14:42+0000

Part of the answer goes back to a battle fought in A.D. 9 in the treacherous marshes and dense thickets of Teutoburg Forest, near modern Osnabrck. As described by the Roman historian Tacitus, three Roman legions led by Quinctilius Varus had crossed the Rhine from Gaul, intent on incorporating the vast area known as Germania into the empire. They were ambushed and annihilated by German tribes under the command of a warrior named Arminius. It was one of the worst military disasters the Romans ever suffered. Some years ago, archaeologists discovered the site of the battle; the debris field was a mile wide and 15 miles long. Caesar Augustus, it is said, roamed the hallways of his palace, crying, Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions! Henceforth, the Romans pretty much wrote off the area east of the Rhine and north of the Alps.

He wears hip ankle boots and designer jeans while dashing between TED talks and his lab at Baylor. In his spare time, Eagleman has even written an acclaimed collection of speculative short stories, Sum: Forty Tales From the Afterlives, that will be staged as a full opera in London next year. Hes also getting some traction with his efforts to start a new quasi-religious movement called Possibilianism, which aims to move beyond the dueling certitudes of traditional religion and atheism to explore radical what-ifs about the universe and human consciousness. One story in Sum, for example, considers the possibility that life on earth may be just a brief, pleasurable vacation from our true existence as gigantic beings doing the heavy lifting of holding up the cosmos.

Due to an irrevocable death sentence, imminent mob execution or torture to death, these philosophers found themselves in the most paradoxical of situations: lovers of logic and rational argumentation, silenced by brute force; professional makers of discourses, banned from using the word; masters of debate and contradiction, able to argue no more.

The film, directed by J. J. Abrams, is one of the few summer releases that does not benefit from being a sequel or having a built-in fan base. In an effort to offset this handicap and spread some quick word of mouth Paramount Pictures held early screenings on Thursday and urged customers to tweet about the film. Private screenings were also held on Wednesday night for Twitter users with large numbers of followers. X-Men: First Class from 20th Century Fox held steady at second place with $25 million, dropping 55 percent from last weekends total, an above-average second-week showing for a summer blockbuster. That franchise reboot has accumulated a North American total of $98.9 million, according to Box Office Mojo, which tracks sales data. The Hangover Part II (Warner Brothers) was third with $18.5 million, proving the continued appeal of the misadventures of the Wolf Pack. In fourth place, Kung Fu Panda 2 (DreamWorks Animation, via Paramount) piled on another $16.6 million. At fifth place with $10.8 million, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (Walt Disney Studios) crossed the $200 million mark in North America. So far at this summers box office, ticket sales are up 13.5 percent compared with this stage in the season last year, but are still down 9 percent for the year so far.",2011-06-12T22:03:36+0000

The university is accepting a donation of works from one of the most important private collections of Abstract Expressionism. The group of 121 paintings and sculptures, owned by Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson, had long been expected to make its way to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which has been the beneficiary of the Andersons for many years. But the couple, known as Hunk and Moo, said in a statement that we have always been closely associated with colleges and universities, and in making this gift to Stanford we anticipate the students, the public and the entire art community will have the opportunity to fully engage the collection. The collection, which the Andersons began building in the 1960s, includes one of the last major Jackson Pollock drip paintings still in private hands, Lucifer, from 1947, when Pollock was making his transition from a more traditional style to his signature volcanic canvases. Several years ago dealers familiar with the painting said that the Andersons had turned down as much as $100 million for it. The collection also includes significant works by Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis and Philip Guston. Stanford said that by 2014 it expected to complete construction of a building to house the collection, which includes 86 artists in all, in styles including Abstract Expressionism and reflecting movements like Light and Space and Color Field painting.",2011-06-13T22:29:09+0000

Rob McKenna, a Republican who is the states attorney general, announced his long-anticipated candidacy last week. Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat whose district includes parts of the politically crucial Seattle region, has signaled for months that he would run if Ms. Gregoire did not.

Robertss descriptions of soldiers and officers are masterly and humane, and his battlefield set pieces are as gripping as any I have ever read. He has visited many of the battlefields, and has an unusually good eye for detail as well as a painterly skill at physical description. (His nearly perfect sense of terrain and geography is marred only by his regrettable conflation of Russia with the Soviet Union, which leads to confusion about battlefield locations, German war aims and Soviet casualties.) He is just as much at home at sea as on land; from Midway to El Alamein his prose is unerringly precise and stirringly vivid. It is hard to imagine a better-told military history of World War II.

In her slim but ambitious book, The Central Park Five: A Chronicle of a City Wilding, Sarah Burns tackles this same question, but with a changed referent. This, rather than signifying a horrific gang rape in New York Citys bucolic backyard, here signifies a preventable miscarriage of justice that put five Harlem teenagers behind bars for a crime they didnt commit. Each of the boys  Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise and Raymond Santana Jr.  served between 7 and 13 years.

State of Wonder, Patchetts eighth book and sixth novel, is no less multinational in its cast of characters, or high-stakes in its plot.",2011-06-17T17:08:17+0000

us,When Women Lost the Vote,"Iwonder how todays advice columnists might handle a query John Dunton received in 1691. A London printer and bookseller, Dunton was the great-granddaddy of all agony aunts and uncles. He had offered to answer questions from readers of his periodical, The Athenian Mercury. Someone asked him what a man should do if his mother and his sweetheart were in equal peril at the same time. Which one should he save? Dunton suggested that we esteem it more generous, were it possible, to die himself than lose either. Gallant Mr. Dunton appears nearly halfway through Mary Beth Nortons suggestive if idiosyncratic new book, Separated by Their Sex. He is a villain in the story, since Norton assigns him the role of defining women as suited to the soft glories of home life and men as strivers in the public world. His chivalry was part of a larger effort to keep the fair sex away from political power. Or so it seems.",2011-06-17T17:08:36+0000

us,The Pseudoscience of Hysteria,"Readers who cant identify Jean-Martin Charcot as the name of the French neurologist whose 19th-century experiments with hypnosis influenced Sigmund Freuds theory of neurosis may yet recognize the work he conducted at the Saltptrire Hospital in Paris. Photographs and illustrations of Charcots patients, all women suffering hysteria, remain in currency today, 140 years after they were made, if more as curiosities than as clinically valuable documents. Once seen, these images  of, for example, a woman wearing little more than a tangle of bed sheets, her eyes rolled up into her head in either ecstasy or delirium, or fixed on the invisible object of her amorous supplication  are not easily forgotten, let alone dismissed. Poses classified as passionate attitudes, they have the disquieting aspect of pornography masquerading as intellectual inquiry.",2011-06-17T17:08:37+0000

us,"Im O.K., Youre a Psychopath","Do psychopaths enjoy reading books about psychopaths? In his engagingly irreverent new best seller, The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry (Riverhead, $25.95), the journalist Jon Ronson notes that only about one in 100 people are psychopaths (there is a higher proportion in prisons and corporate boardrooms), but he wonders if this population will be overrepresented among readers of his book. After all, people do enjoy learning about themselves, and psychopaths in particular have an enhanced sense of their own importance. And they might like what Ronson has to say. He approvingly quotes experts who argue that psychopaths make the world go around. Despite their small numbers, they cause such chaos that they remold society  though not necessarily for the better.",2011-06-17T17:08:37+0000
us,"Malcolm X: Criminal, Minister, Humanist, Martyr","His aura was too bright, the poet Maya Angelou said of her first meeting with Malcolm X. His masculine force affected me physically. A hot desert storm eddied around him and rushed to me, making my skin contract, and my pores slam shut. Malcolm X had that same sort of bone-deep, visceral impact on America. He got under everyones skin  either in the sense that he seeped into your pores and transformed you the way the great love of your life does, or in the sense that he annoyed or scared the living hell out of you. There is no middle ground with Malcolm. If you hate him or distrust him, you should consider giving him another try: officers assigned to monitor the wiretaps on his phones sometimes ended up being flipped, because close listening led them to believe that his programs and philosophies were sensible and righteous and that law enforcement agencies should not have been working against him at all. And while Malcolms ideas changed America, his life journey has captivated us even more. He went from a petty criminal and drug user to a long-term prisoner to an influential minister to a separatist political activist to a humanist to a martyr. Throughout his life he continually grew upward, unafraid to challenge or refute what he believed, giving hope that any of us can rise above even our deepest convictions to become better people.",2011-06-17T17:08:37+0000

Interviews of scientists were crosscut with those of self-proclaimed mystics, and swooping in to explain the physics was Dr. Quantum, a cartoon superhero who joyfully demonstrated concepts like wave-particle duality, extra dimensions and quantum entanglement. Wiggling his eyebrows, the good doctor ominously asked, Are we far enough down the rabbit hole yet?

Psychohistory is the field of inquiry that explores the psychological motives of individuals and groups of historical actors, as well as the psychological impact of historical events. Lifton is perhaps best known as the author of Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima, published in 1967, which received a National Book Award. In that book, he described how the hibakusha, those residents of Hiroshima who survived the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, lived with deep and shameful feelings of being inwardly poisoned by their experience, as well as an embittered sense of special knowledge that set them apart from those who had not witnessed the horrors of the attack.",2011-06-17T17:08:48+0000

Ten years after it became standard gear in the United States Army, it has been replaced by the patrol cap as the default head gear for soldiers wearing combat uniforms, CNN reports. Soldiers had complained that the wool beret was hot, hard to adjust and took two hands to put on. Soldiers who were already wearing berets, and who will continue to wear them  like Special Forces, airborne troops and Army Rangers  were not happy either. They thought that having every soldier wear a beret diminished the work they had done to earn theirs. The decision by Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Army chief of staff, reverses a policy laid down by a predecessor, Gen. Eric Shinseki. The patrol cap looks like a baseball cap, but with a flat, not rounded, top.

There was a noticeable excitement in the air as this was the first Design Miami/Basel under the new directorship of Marianne Goebl. Her debut did not disappoint: a record 43 exhibitors showing everything from 20th-century classics to contemporary designers, intelligent design collaborations with corporate sponsors (take note, Art Basel V.I.P. lounge), a great bookstore (courtesy of doyoureadme?! from Berlin) and a well-curated series of talks (full disclosure: I moderated one of them).

League doesnt strike out too many batters (20 in 30 2/3 innings), but he has walked only five, keeps the ball on the ground (2-to-1 ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio) and averages 96 miles per hour on his fastball. He came out of Tuesdays loss in Washington after a line drive hit him on the leg and could miss some time.Trevor Cahill went from a seven-walk, zero-strikeout disaster start on June 14 to an eight-inning, one-walk, seven-strikeout gem on Sunday.

Thats the question everyones asking with regard to Jon Huntsman, who formally announced his candidacy yesterday, and the answer is a resounding yes. From George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole through George W. Bush and John McCain, the modern-day Republican Party has a long tradition of picking nominees whose records and positions place them to the left of True Conservatism, at least as defined by movement institutions, talk radio and the like. Even in the age of the Tea Party, theres reason to imagine this pattern persisting: Many Republican primary voters hold heterodox positions (for instance, on tax increases on the rich) relative to the official conservative line, several of the crucial early primaries allow independents to cross over and vote, and in races against incumbent presidents theres a high premium on electability. Its certainly possible for a Republican to be too liberal for the primary electorate, and often a moderate candidate has to flip-flop on a key issue (or six) to appease the partys interest groups. But the historical record suggests that theres more room between Rush Limbaugh and the center than many commentators (and politicians) seem to think.",2011-06-22T18:13:46+0000

Understood in this way, seduction is less a means to sexual conquest than an end in itself, an exquisitely refined form of social interaction.

Just a gig at a crummy club near CBGB, and late  after 1. There werent a dozen onlookers, but Hsker Ds two early records were knockouts, and that Minneapolis trio never came east, so there we were. From our booth in back the music sounded terrific: headlong and enormous, the guitar unfashionably full, expressive and unending, with two raving vocalists alternating leads on songs whose words were hard to understand and whose tunes werent. Another half-dozen curious fans drifted in. And then, halfway through, the guitarist passed into some other dimension. When he stepped yowling off the low stage, most of us gravitated closer, glancing around and shaking our heads.",2011-06-24T16:23:05+0000
us,Steven Tylers Warp Speed Memoir,"Calling Steven Tyler an incoherent loudmouth is like describing James Brown as a guy who moved around a lot. Tyler has devoted his improbably long musical career to testing the limits of incoherence, loudness and his mouth. From his 1970s glory days as the jive-talking lead singer of Aerosmith to his unlikely TV success as a judge on American Idol, hes always delighted in babble for its own sake. In his words, hes been 61 Highwayed and I did it my wayed; Little-Willie-Johned and been-here-and-goned; million-dollar riffed and Jimmy Cliffed; cotton-picked and Stevie Nickd. What he lacks in lucidity, which is just about everything, he makes up for with garrulous charm. As Laurence Sterne says of Yorick in Tristram Shandy, he has big sails but not an ounce of ballast.",2011-06-24T16:23:42+0000
us,Curing the Pelvic Headache,"The appeal of conversion stories often depends on descriptions of the darkness before enlightenment: we enjoy learning in detail about the presalvation misery, debauchery or sinfulness. The more detail, the better. The English novelist Tim Parks understands that principle. In his urbane, droll, weird yet far from charmless account of the pain and misery suffered by his body in general, and by his bladder, prostate, penis and related bits in particular, the conversion is from a cerebral, anxious, hunched-over and compulsively verbal kvetch (not his term, but the literal squeeze makes the Yiddish word seem appropriate) to something resembling the opposite.

Watts explains: We claim to be saying that the Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world because it has attributes X, Y and Z. But really what were saying is that the Mona Lisa is famous because its more like the Mona Lisa than anything else. In other words, we are trapped inside a hall of mirrors of our own devising. We think the Mona Lisa is famous because of its traits, but we think those traits are significant only because they belong to the Mona Lisa, which we know to be famous. Ditto Shakespeare? Yes. When an incredulous English professor asked him whether he believed Shakespeare might just be a fluke of history, Watts indicated that he meant exactly that.",2011-06-24T16:25:38+0000

First its veranda goes under and then its windows, until the rooms look drowned and the building itself appears to leave its moorings. The imagination of disaster is never far from these pages, and though this house will finally stay on its foundation, it does get swamped by a monsoon-swelled river, and with consequences that are bitter indeed. That waterfront property is only one of the three houses in which Roys narrative is played out  each of them bedraggled, each living on after its time, and none of them a proper home.",2011-06-24T16:26:19+0000

While waiting, she blogs. Through a suicide note that eventually becomes an autobiography almost perfectly contemporary with the American Century, we learn that Pam has been many things: rich mothers regret, successful author, war correspondent, diplomats wife. She was on the beach at Normandy, saw Dachau liberated and knew the Kennedys. ",2011-06-24T16:26:26+0000
us,Cambodia After Year Zero,"In the preface to Cambodias Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land, Joel Brinkley recalls his first encounter with Cambodia. Brinkley was reporting for The Louisville Courier-Journal from a refugee camp near the Thai border in 1979, in the aftermath of Pol Pots reign. As they tell of years of horror and misery, Brinkley wrote, their faces are expressionless and dull . . . as if theyre talking about a dull day of work. Their tales end with a nodding acknowledgment of the death of their nation and culture. Brinkley, who later worked for The New York Times, finds little has changed in the 32 years since then. As the title suggests, his book is an unabashed plea to refocus international aid and diplomacy on a suffering people. It is also an attempt to hold some of those responsible for that suffering accountable  but not all.Cambodia lost a quarter of its population under the Khmer Rouge. For many, survival meant 14-hour days of backbreaking work, often on little more than a cupful of rice or a smattering of gruel. You could be killed on the least suspicion you sympathized with the Vietnamese. The effects of this period have proven hard to shake.",2011-06-24T16:26:42+0000

Hurriedly wed and brought to England as the newest Duchess of Marlborough, Lily arrived at Blenheim, the familys vast, dilapidated country seat. The first thing that confronted her, Mary S.

us,Videophiles | Xeno & Oaklanders The Staircase,"Just when you thought winter was finally over, a cold front suddenly hits. The new video for The Staircase, by the synth pop group Xeno & Oaklander, which makes is United States premiere on The Moment today, epitomizes the cool aesthetic of the underground minimal electronics movement. The video has the quality of a Xerox, reproduced over and over, blown out and dark, and induces a sense of something lost. Sean McBride and Miss Liz Wendelbo, the duo behind Xeno & Oaklander, along with other members of the Wierd Records label, have been largely credited with the revival of minimal wave here in New York. Taryn Waldman of Boxmotion, who directed the The Staircase, and Patrick Stroub, its cinematographer, make references to Roman Polanskis film Repulsion, as a slip of a woman, Xeno (Wendelbo), climbs the stairs of a claustrophobic 19th-century Brooklyn tenement building, seemingly unaware that the object of her affection and of her voyeurism, Oaklander (McBride), is right next to her. (Xenos stark, wintry eyes come courtesy of the master retoucher Pascal Dangin, known in fashion circles for his work for Annie Leibovitz, Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Meisel, Steven Klein, Craig McDean and others.)

In Ontario, the Stratford Shakespeare Festivals new revival of Jesus Christ Superstar, the 1971 rock opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice about the last week of Jesus life, has received rave reviews from local theater critics, prompting New York producers and other critics to book flights to Toronto for a look. Mr. Lloyd Webber, who holds the rights to mount a Broadway revival, saw the production this month and called it fabulous, adding that it was very probably the best acted performance of the show I have ever seen. Mr. Rice has also seen it, adding to the buzz that the production might have a life beyond Stratford. The director, Des McAnuff, who is also artistic director of the festival, said in a telephone interview that were definitely taking calls from New York and elsewhere about having a future elsewhere, but its very much an open question. Asked about a transfer to Broadway, Mr. McAnuff said, We would of course love to move this and love an opportunity to take our Stratford company members with us if we go.",2011-06-26T22:11:12+0000

We underestimated the passion viewers have for closure within a season, Charlie Collier  told Entertainment Weekly on Friday. If I could do anything differently, it would be to manage expectations. Many fans of The Killing (with Mireille Enos, above), which is about an investigation into the death of a teenage girl in Seattle, were left fuming when the first season ended on June 19 without an explanation for the crime. The anger was noticeable on social media Web sites, prompting Mr. Colliers acknowledgment. The audience has an important voice, we heard them and dont take them for granted, he said. Mr. Collier said he stood by the shows executive producer, Veena Sud, who told the public radio show The Business, last week that the investigation would be resolved in Season 2. Ms. Sud recounted a conversation on one Web site that had a viewer declaring, Ill never ever come back for season two. She said, On the same thread three more people popped up and said: I havent watched this show yet, but now I will because you guys are so emotional about it, its gotta be something to watch.

The Boston Globe reported that after a lengthy investigation into the work, an oil portrait by the Dutch painter Eglon van der Neer, the museum determined that it had belonged to Walter Westfeld, who had run a German gallery shut down by the Nazis in 1936 and who was sent to Auschwitz in 1943. The museum, which purchased the painting in 1941, posted an image of it online in 2000 amid concerns about its provenance; in 2004 it was contacted by Fred Westfield, a nephew of the art dealer. Mr. Westfield, a retired economics professor in Tennessee, learned about the painting from a Google search. The Globe said that the museum had in recent years returned other works stolen during World War II. It also fought a legal battle to keep the Oskar Kokoschka painting Two Nudes (Lovers); a federal appeals court ruled last year that it was the rightful owner of this work.",2011-06-27T16:45:45+0000

Those detained are both monks and laypeople. The protests took place in an area that Tibetans call Kardze, known to the Chinese as Ganzi. The local police headquarters had no comment. The area has been unsettled since April 2008, when at least eight Tibetans were killed by Chinese security forces firing into a crowd of protestors, Tibetan exile groups said at the time. Those protests took place as part of a large uprising that began in Lhasa, Tibet, and unfolded across the Tibetan plateau. The report this week also said two monks from Kardze held a protest in the Barkhor market in Lhasa on June 22, possibly the first there since March 2008.

Well, an all-but-forgotten short film featuring footage of the comic star failed to sell at a London auction, defying expectations that it might fetch a six-figure sum, Reuters reported. The reserve price on the film at Wednesdays sale was 100,000 ($160,000) at Bonhams auctioneers, but apparently that was too high. Charlie Chaplin in Zepped,  is believed to be a propaganda film made in Britain during World War I. A collector discovered the seven-minute short inside an old film reel tin and bought it in 2009 for 3.20 (about $5) on the online auction site eBay. The film shows Chaplin taking on a German Zeppelin aircraft and features some of the earliest animation in film history. Chaplin probably never knew of the movies existence, said the film critic and Chaplin biographer David Robinson, according to Reuters. Mr. Robinson said an anonymous filmmaker had put together outtakes from three earlier Chaplin pictures  His New Profession (1914), A Jitney Elopement (1915) and The Tramp (1915)  and included sequences of stop-motion animation and other effects.
