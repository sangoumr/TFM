Many may wind up with refunds, instead of owing money to the Government on April 15. The newest legislation, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, provides for a dramatic cut in income tax rates over a four-year period. The first phase, which took effect Oct. 1, reduced individual tax rates by 5 percent across the board. This reduction for the final quarter of 1981 has been translated into a tax credit of 1.25 percent that is built into the tax tables accompanying one's return for the whole year.

us,Art View; DE STIJL IS SURVEYED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY EXHIBITION; MINNEAPOLIS,"For the large public that nowadays takes a keen interest in the history of modern art, the most important event currently occurring in this country is the definitive exhibition called ''De Stijl: 1917-1931, Visions of Utopia,'' which has just opened at the Walker Art Center. It has been 30 years since the late Alfred H. Barr Jr. devoted an exhibition to this Dutch avant-garde movement at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In the interim, much new information on the movement has come to light, and an even greater significance has come to be ascribed to its achievements. Clearly, the time had come to take a fresh look at these achievements, and this is what the Walker has now done, both in the exhibition organized by Mildred Friedman, the museum's curator of design, and in the accompanying book that Mrs. Friedman has edited for the occasion and that will long serve as a standard work of reference on the subject. The result is a major contribution not only to our understanding of De Stijl itself but to our appreciation of the entire European avant-garde in the period between the two World Wars.",1982-02-07T05:00:00+0000

Miss Landey has been scouting auctions and flea markets for the past decade, finding old lockets and pins with cupid and heart themes. Her silver Valentine collection, now in Bloomingdale's, includes a heart-shaped locket to hold a photograph ($135), cupid pins ($94) and a charming place card holder of hearts and cupids ($115). You'll find them in the costume jewelry department on the street floor. 2. Blooming With Silk A Valentine bouquet can last a long time, thanks to a bright idea from Marguerite Hennessey, who presides over a florist business called the Whole Blooming Works. For $40, Miss Hennessey will put together an arrangement of fresh spring flowers in a bamboo basket. Along with it, she sends a bunch of silk flowers and as the fresh ones die, the fake ones can be ''planted'' in the basket. (The arrangement shown is of silk flowers.) The Whole Blooming Works, at 111 West 28th Street, requires at least one day's notice and will deliver in Manhattan only for a fee of $1.50. Telephone is 695-3247.",1982-02-10T05:00:00+0000

The U.S. Coast Guard cutter assigned to intercept boats that slip past newly vigilant Haitian patrols has only found two loads of migrants to turn back on the high seas, one after it stopped in Cuba. The procedure, as explained by U.S. officials, rivals Graham Greene for farce. People are asked where they came from and why they want to go to the U.S. If they say they're looking for work or a better life, they're sent back, registered with the International Red Cross, given $20 to get home and told to complain to the U.S. Embassy if anybody persecutes them for having tried to leave.

Mr. Gray's harrowing black comedy about Vietnam, which opened at the Westside Arts Theater last night, asks that Mr. Gunton play an entire war-torn society all by himself. Not only must the actor impersonate more than 20 characters - characters of 2 sexes, 2 nationalities and all social strata - but he also must provide the sounds of Vietnam's gunfire, its bombing runs, its incessant background rock music. And Mr. Gunton does it all - without makeup, without elaborate costumes, without letup. Through sheer actor's magic, he transforms himself into a one-man ''Apocalypse Now.''",1982-02-18T05:00:00+0000

us,How to visit the shrine,"Making Arrangements For those who don't speak Japanese, a visit to the shrine at Izumo and its inner sanctuary is best arranged through the Japan National Tourist Organization in Tokyo, which will get in touch with the shrine's Tokyo branch and ask permission for the visit. The tourist organization is also the best source of interpreters; there are said to be only six part-timers in Shimane prefecture, the region encompassing Izumo and Matsue. The charge, according to the prefectural tourist office in Matsue is about $42 a day. The Yagumo Honjin inn also requires interpreters as well as reservations for lunch. Getting There The quickest way to get to Izumo from Tokyo is by air, a round-trip cost of about $174. The alternative is to go by bullet train, perhaps with a stopover at Kyoto, changing trains to Okayama, and getting onto a local express. The entire journey takes about seven hours and costs about $63. The merit of the train is that it enables one to see the startling contrast between the densely crowded southern seaboard, one line of factories and forests, and the sparsely inhabited parts north of the mountains. Further Reading ''Shinto Art: Ise and Izumo Shrines'' by Yasutada Watanabe, published by John Weatherhill, New York, and Heibonsha, Tokyo, is the best guide to the two holiest spots in Japan. It is an architectural detective story in which Professor Watanabe traces 1,500 years of history and unfolds the mysteries of the shrines' origins in the prehistoric age.",1982-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Yet he was never exactly a neglected or obscure figure. He exhibited frequently, he had important friends in the art world, and he remained very alert to what was going on until the end of his very long and happy life. He also enjoyed the esteem of certain contemporaries -among them, the late Ad Reinhardt - who were never famous for overpraising the work of their fellow artists. Yet Shaw remains an almost unknown painter, and the two exhibitions that the Washburn Gallery is currently devoting to his work - paintings of the 1930's and 40's at 42 East 57th Street, and paintings of the 60's at 113 Greene Street in SoHo (both through March 13) - are likely to give many people their first glimpse of it.",1982-02-21T05:00:00+0000

I had done some journalism in high school, where I had been a mediocre science student, and for a time I thought I might like to become a journalist. This ambition did not last very long, and gradually -under the influence of some great teachers, such as Philipp Frank and Julian Schwinger - I shifted to mathematics and then, in graduate school to theoretical physics. All the while, I was writing - but for nobody in particular. I did not take a single course in creative writing. I never tried to write for the Harvard Crimson or any of the literary magazines that flourished at Harvard. I simply scribbled away at poems, short stories and aphorisms by the dozens, all on sheets of note paper, surrounded by formulae, and, by and large, shown to nobody.

Early does not mean the crack of dawn because Tenayuca is only about four miles north of the circle that marks the intersection of Avenida Insurgentes and the Paseo de la Reforma, the center of Mexico City. At Tenayuca the hours do not seem to be fixed; you may have to wait outside until the caretaker is willing to unlock the gate and accept your 5 pesos. Although much of this modest-sized pyramid and the undulating sculptural frieze of linked serpents representing Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, can be seen from outside the low retaining wall that surrounds the monument, this pyramid is worth climbing and a close look. It is thought to be very similar in style to the great pyramid that once stood in the center of the Aztec capital of Tenochitlan, now Mexico City. But it is only about half the size. The pyramid is fascinating because, like many of the monuments of that era, it was constructed in successive stages, each superimposed on the existing structure. Today, remains of the various levels are clearly marked. Tenayuca was built in seven stages, the last about 1450. By climbing the outer stairway on the facade (which dates from the sixth period; the seventh and final building period was devoted mainly to refinements) one can cross over to the inner, fourth-period structure and view the stairway that remains.",1982-02-28T05:00:00+0000

She's apt to frequent the trendy hair salons and pick up on the newest cosmetics and accessories. She is not necessarily of any specific age -she can be from late middle age downward - but she is a specific type with a strong personal, if quirky, sense of style. She is the woman the stores refer to as ''the contemporary customer,'' the exact opposite of the woman who builds a wardrobe from season to season and who sometimes sticks to one or just a few designers. ''The contemporary customer wants what's hot right now,'' explains Rick Goldstein, a vice president and fashion director at Macy's. ''This woman mixes up her favorite designer's stuff.

Sir James Jeans first propounded this heresy more than 50 years ago and its reverberations have never quite died away. He concluded that the tone of a single piano note depends on nothing more than gradations of weight, ignoring for purposes of his thesis the horizontal relation of one note to the next in melodic lines or to vertically related notes in chordal music.",1982-02-28T05:00:00+0000

By all appearances, Andrew was a normal newborn, with the reflexes and level of alertness one expects in a nearly term baby (Andrew had been due to arrive on Christmas Day). But two months earlier, prenatal diagnosis had revealed that Andrew was suffering from a severe and probably life-threatening condition: fetal hydrocephalus, in which the fluid-filled regions of the brain, called the ventricles, expand monstrously and push so hard on the brain itself that nerve cells fail to develop. The result of fetal hydrocephalus is usually profound retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy or death. Andrew was saved from this fate by a team of doctors at Prentice Women's Hospital and Maternity Center in Chicago, who treated him when they hoped they had time to salvage some healthy brain tissue. They operated on Andrew while he was still in the womb. Andrew is one of the world's first travelers to cross the brave new frontier of fetal surgery; he and the handful of others who have had similar treatment represent medical advances that seemed unthinkable even 10 years ago. For doctors are discovering that not only can the fragile and previously inviolable environment of the womb be tapped and sounded to provide vital information about the progress of a pregnancy, but that the fetus itself can tolerate correctivesurgery while inside the uterus.",1982-02-28T05:00:00+0000
