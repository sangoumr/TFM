It's nice to hear about a Western that begins, as ""Kid Blue"" does, with a carefully planned train hold-up that doesn't even succeed in stopping the train. Inept bandits are usually funny. So are bogus preachers and the innocence of solid citizens who don't recognize a high-class whore when they meet her.Yet ""Kid Blue"" is never very funny or provocative. It tries too hard. It's too insistent. Like the performance of Mr. Hopper (who is getting a bit long in the tooth to play naifs with much conviction), ""Kid Blue"" is a heavily mannered work, with little or no sense of the spontaneous gaiety that one got from time to time in Eliot Silverstein's ""Cat Ballou.""One has the feeling that James Frawley, the director, and Edwin Shrake, who wrote the screenplay, are good-hearted but essentially humorless men, incapable of constructing any kind of comfortable bridges between the film's would-be comic and melodramatic sequences. When Warren Oates, as Kid Blue's best friend, starts to talk admiringly of ""the old-time Greeks"" who went bare-of clothes, one cringes in the anticipation of the about-to-be-delivered folksy wisdom, with which the movie is unspontaneously stuffed.""Kid Blue"" is a well-meaning, liberal, anti-fascist Western, dressed up with some good performances by Peter Boyle, Lee Purcell and Janice Rule. But it's not a very good movie.",1973-10-01T05:00:00+0000

In the imminence of history, a big crowd finally had surrounded him, but Henry Aaron hadn't changed. He never deviated from his ritual. When he appeared, he was holding his blue batting helmet in his left hand. In his right hand was his white bat. When he knelt on his right knee in the ondeck circle, he looked out at Dave Roberts, a lefthanded pitcher for the Houston Astros, while he dropped his helmet on the grass and picked up the brown weighted bat. Quickly, he swung the two bats together. Then, his cheeks slightly puffed, he let out a deep breath. It was his only apparent surrender to tension in the afternoon that ended in a downpour, that ended with his lifting his batting average to 301 with three singles, but that ended without the home run, Babe Ruth's record has endured for 38 years, and now it will endure for six more months.",1973-10-01T05:00:00+0000

I doubt that this latest work, ""History Lessons,"" will arouse quite the same response, but Straub, a political exile from France who lives in Germany and Italy, is a director who clearly stirs passionate feelings among cinastes.His reputation here comes directly from the film festival and Dan Talbot of the New Yorker Theater, who has acquired his films despite their scant commercial appeal. Intensely political and self-consciously intellectual, Jean-Marie Straub is becoming a cult director who gets those kissesand also boos.""History Lessons"" may well be the festival's most teasingly irritating film. It is impossible to likeeven for many dedicated Straubists. Half the press audience walked out of ""Othon,"" his adaptation of a Corneille drama, a few years ago at the festival, and it was more comprehensible than ""History Lessons,"" Straub's austere version of a Brecht novel about Julius Caesar.The camera seldom moves. Mostly it stays slightly behind the head of a young man as he drives his sports car aimlessly through the streets of Rome, a modern city suspended in an ancient world.The young man's function is almost that of a detective in a philosophical thriller. He searches out elderly Romans  a banker, a lawyer, a peasant  who remember Caesar. As their garlanded past blends into his transistorized present, he pieces together a Brechtian-Marxian-Straubian viewpoint on history.The interviews are long tedious monologues, in which the static figures speak almost expressionlessly in German, a language that sounds very curious amid sunburnt Italian settings. But German also has a harsh, didactic quality that provides another Straubian juxtaposition.Jean-Marie Straub deliberately alienates his audience. He defies traditional concepts of the medium just as minimal art in the nineteen-sixties went against prevailing sculptural ideas and as the music of Philip Glass ignores accepted theories of composition today.With ""History Lessons,"" he further tests his audiencewith a film that is coldly anticinema.",1973-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,A Tear in the Ocean' From France:The Cast,"Jewish resistance to the Nazis in Poland needs no stressing now as a heart-breaking, indelible testament to courage and faith. But if the likes of the 1943 Warsaw ghetto uprising has become familiar in films, ""A Tear in the Ocean,"" the French feature that had its local premiere at the Plaza yesterday, is disturbingly different as an exposure of men's minds (both Jew and Pole) under extreme stress.Henri Glaeser, who produced, directed, helped adapt and appears in this dramatization of a novel by Manes Sperber, is more concerned with the terrible decisions his principals must make than with guerrilla action. Even though there is enough gunfire and bloodshed here to make this more than just a tract, the heart of the matter is whether the Jews of Wolyna will cling passively to their beliefs in the face of callous, godless invaders or resist as men fighting oppressors.However, this is multifaceted, philosophical drama dominated by the convictions of its beleaguered characters. There is the flinty performance of Alexandre Stere, as a tough, singleminded Austrian Jewish doctor, determined to save Wolyna's ghetto dwellers. And there is Armand Abplanalp, as a Polish count and the leader of his own resistance group, who is his friend and quite ready to help him.But some of the villagers choose not to fight and are mowed down, among them a revered rabbi, played with dignity and reserve by Mr. Glaeser. Others, including Dominique Rollin, as the rabbi's dedicated, frail but fearless teen-age son, follow the doctor and join the compassionate count's underground guerrillas. However, peasant Poles resent these newcomers, unlikely warriors all, because they feel their fight is for Poland and not for Jews. It's a smoldering situation that, after a successful ambush of a Nazi platoon, erupts with tragic results.Mr. Glaeser, who shot his color film in 1971 on strikingly autumnal locations in Alsace, purposely leaves unanswered the gnawing question: whether resistance in fictitious Wolyna, like the actual bloody Warsaw uprising that followed it in time, was no more effective than the titular ""tear in the ocean.""Like the performances and the philosophies that are translated in lucid English subtitles, ""A Tear in the Ocean"" is both effective and provocative.",1973-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'Ritorno':The Cast,"Gianni Amico's ""Ritorno"" is set thematically near the soulless wasteland of Michelangelo Antonioni, whose beautiful but emotionally dried-up couples embark on a search into their past that reveals the arid desert of their lives. Their experiences, which expose desensitized nerves, are painfully cathartic.In ""Ritorno"" a handsome married couple, on the verge of being bored with each other, suddenly leave Rome one night and drive through an ominous thunderstorm to the husband's family several hours away. A telegram had arrived announcing that his father was dying. Now, wordlessly  and fearfully  they race the shadow of death.But their homecoming is a surprise; the withered father is very much alive. No one knows who sent the wire. As they attempt to find the answer from discarded lovers, disillusioned friends and relatives who only want to eat, they realize the trip is a preview of death. They will have to make it again, soon.A provocative situation quickly becomes dulled by the mushy influence of another director, Claude Lelouch. ""Ritorno"" focuses on billowing storm clouds, radiant meadows and simmering afternoon sunlightexternal textures.The puzzled, windswept couple have about as much depth as a cup of espresso. Their accidental remembrance of youth past is never more meaningful than the excessively used pleasantry, ""Ciao.""The film stops being a prosaic postcard for only a brief moment, when the unforgettable Laura Betti, as the husband's demented old flame, sends a wickedly sensuous venom stinging across the landscape. Her gothic villa frightens the husband away. If his ""return"" has any truth worth pursuing, it probably remains hidden there.",1973-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: A Story of Corruption:' Rejeanne Padovani' Is the Canadian Entry The Cast,"As a sobering drama, ""Rjeanne Padovani,"" shown last night as the Canadian feature entry at the New York Film Festival, is, like its venal principals, fascinating but imperfect.Corruption among its effete, influential Canadian wheeler-dealers, politicos and their ruthless hirelings is made shockingly obvious but it remains as an indictment of characters who are sometimes undefined and shadowy. In essence, ""Rjeanne Padovani"" evolves as an intermittently vivid illustration of truths that more often strike at the mind rather than the heart.Denys Arcand, its 32-year-old director and a newcomer to the United States movie scene, maintains a good deal of suspense as his group of bigwigs dine at the plush Montreal home of Jean Lajeunesse on his completion of a superhighway. He, like the governmental minister, the mayor, their assistants, wives and secretaries as well as their police and bodyguards dining in the servants' quarters, are obliquely exposed as urbane, suave or rough, direct men and women callously on the take or on the make.Unfortunately, Luce Guilbeault, as the ill-fated, estranged wife of the builder, who turns up pleading to be reunited with her children after a long liaison with another man, is not entirely convincing in her motivations. If she provides a strong portrayal as the only decently emotional individual in an otherwise nefarious crew, Mr. Arcand also indicates the power, lust and money drives that propel the others in that cynical crowd.As the cool, polished tycoon, Mr. Lajeunesse is there with payoff gifts to his guests who helped him steal millions, as well as their muscle men. He loves his kids and he is ready to daily with one of his willing guests while looking the other way as his wife faces her doom. And the fatuous mayor, the minister and the builder's tough strongarm man, Pierre Theriault, among others in a large cast, make the going rough for inquiring reporters, potential demonstrators and the gangster opposition.Although its French dialogue is made plain by English subtitles, ""Rjeanne Padovani"" presents a grim picture of corruptors whose acts are more explicit than their feelings.

Shows a Lo of Sydne Rome The Cast,"Roman Polanski's ""What? is an X-rated nonsense comedy about a Goldilocks marqu, a wide-eyed America girl on the loose in Asia an Europe, and her specific adventures among some mad characters she meets when she takes refuge in an Italian seaside villa to escape three would-be rapists.The girl, played by a new actress whose name is improbably spelled Sydne (conventionally pronounced ""Sidney"") Rome, has hair that looks like an elaborate taffy dessert. She also has a terrible time keeping her clothe on, try as she will. When they aren't torn off in usually friendly struggles, they are stolen while she sleeps. Sometimes she's reduced to wearing a dinner napkin. Sometimes she just gives up and wears nothing, but she is never daunted. Nobody in the villa notices.In addition to a body that invites constant assaults like Everest, the girl possesses the kind of optimistic American purpose that pioneered the West, invented the light bulb and developed frozen food. She is as curious unflappable and self-assured as a favored child and, as she is ravaged by the world so does she ravage it. When she finally departs the villa at least one of its inhabitants has expired in the sheer joy of contemplating her.""What?"", which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater is a male chauvinist pig sort of comedy. It is not consistently inspired in its lunacy, but it is so totally without redeeming social value that it should be protected and, from time to time, cherished, as when a grumpy maid attempts to clear the air of flies and mistakes and aerosol can of shaving cream for Fly-Tox.Anarchic comedy is a form that continues to challenge Polanski even though neither he nor his script collaborator, Gerard Brach succeeded in their earlier 'Cul-de-Sac"" or ""The Fearless Vampire Killers."" Perhaps, like verse drama, it's become one of those things that need only to be attempted to succeed in partial measure. It can be fun to watch the try.Occasionally Polanski and Brach seem to want to introduce a system of surreal disorder to the girl's adventures in the villa, but I doubt that they really much care beyond presenting us with an Alice trying to comprehend an X-rated Wonderand. Among the inhabitants are Marcello Mastroianni, playing a former pimp with a sense of honor and a passion for sado-masochistic games; Hugh Griffith, the Villa's ancient owner, once a great collector of art, now a man who prefers the object to its artistic image, and other assorted odd balls, including Polanski himself.The girl, the villa and the performances are beautiful enough to bridge those sequences when the film, like its heroine, seems searching for explanations that will never be found.",1973-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'La Rupture':Chabrol's Melodrama Shown at Festival The Cast,"Claude Chabrol has reportedly described his 1970 melodrama, ""La Rupture"" (The Breakup), as belonging to his Fritz Lang period, which may be one of its virtues as well as one of its difficulties. The film, which was shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center last night, will be shown there again tonight.At least I find it difficult to sit comfortably through a movie in which innocence and virtue are so hopelessly imperiled that it takes nothing less than a fairly arbitrary plot device to straighten things out.""La Rupture,"" with a screenplay adapted by Chabrol from a novel by Charlotte Armstrong, has so many beautiful things in it that I'm tempted to suspect some terrible weakness in myself, rather than the film, for the feeling of depressed impatience it left. Perhaps not.Perhaps one should be impatient with a film that opens with a brutal sequence in which a father beats up his wife and attempts to smash the brains of his 4-year-old son. Later on, the film treats us to the spectacle of a retarded teen-age girl, who has been kidnapped and drugged by the villain, being shown pornographic films and seduced by the man's mistress.It's not that newspapers don't contain stories of worse horrors, but that Chabrol, who is not a frivolous film maker, allows these things to be put in the service of a rather frivolous end. That is, our entertainment.I realize that in saying this I'm also testifying to the film's effect, which is torturous. But then I found Lang's ""Human Desire,"" which is a much tougher film, much easier to endure.""La Rupture"" is the story of a woman trapped in such circumstances that even her decency and trust can be used as weapons against her.When Hlne, played by the extraordinarily gifted Stphane Audran, attempts to leave her husband, a part-time writer and full-time junkie, her wealthy father-in-law attempts to discredit her morals in order to obtain custody of his grandson. The father-in-law, played by Michel Bouquet (who, like Miss Audran, has become an important contributor to Chabrol's films), employs Jean-Pierre Cassel to frame Hlne, but the attempts are so clumsy that the film, though emotionally harrowing, is plausible only as an arid statement about the possibility of evil.Within this frame, which I found difficult to accept, ""La Rupture"" contains some true Chabrol achievements, especially the sense of locale (Belgium, which is seen as the suburb to the rest of the world), and the performance by Miss Audran. About halfway through the film, she delivers a monologue about Hlne's marriage that is one of the most moving things I've seen this year. It may be difficult on any realistic level to accept Miss Audran as the barmaid she is supposed to be, but the stunning quality of her beauty and personality become a kind of personification of Chabrol's cool concerns, which, otherwise, have no recognizable human shape.There is also another problem with the frame of the film: the disadvantages and indignities are piled so thickly on the poor heroine that one knows early that the film is obliged to offer her vindication. Otherwise it has no shape. That her vindication is achieved at a high price isn't surprising or touching enough to transform the melodrama of ""La Rupture"" into tragedy.",1973-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'The Mother and Whore':The Cast,"Time-traveling can be demoralizing  when you're going in reverse. Watching ""The Mother and the Whore,"" you find that you're back in the movie-sludge of the nineteen-fifties, when a number of mediocre French films focused on sub-Sagan characters: numb, semi-paralyzed creatures who hardly had the calories to drag themselves through the day. Then, boredom was a hip diseaseand it all comes rushing down the spout of memory when Jean-Pierre Laud explains that he lives ""in a world where people are old at 17."" Jean Eustache's picture, which was shown last night at the New York Film Festival, is so reminiscent of those mossy productions that you start wondering if nothing has been learned about movies, about acting, about men and women. The discoveries of the last decade have been erased. Or else the sixties never happened: you were just hallucinating.It's been claimed that the movie explores all the possible relationships between men and women  which seems like an invitation for a sackrace to the nearest crematorium. Laud has two girlfriends: Bernadette Lafont and Franoise Lebrun. He talks. They listen. The usher says you can't smoke. It takes three and a half hours to state that women are unpredictable and that men are easily depressed. There's a bale of boastful talk about sex but not much of it. Finally, Miss Lebrun has hysterics, Laud asks her to marry him, she says yes and throws up, Now you can smoke.But this movie won the Grand Prix and also the International Critics Prize at Cannes. Before we all take sanity tests, let's examine the fantasies afoot. The director has said that we won't be able to distinguish between the mother and the whore. He's wrong about that. While both women are made to be incredibly passive, Bernadette Lafont is permitted a bit of gumption when she's jealousan emotion that turns Laud on. (He gets very jealous himself.) When a woman is jealous, it must mean that she's possessive, therefore a mother: by definition a figure to be needled and punctually defied and, finally, left. A mother is someone to escapewhen she's not changing spiritual diapers. ""The whore"" is simply a woman who has had a lot of sex. At first, she says she likes it, later she calls it sordid; ultimately, she has to repent.Perhaps there's meant to be a whiff of grim maternity in her character: because she's a nurse who gives anesthetics. By implication, a nurse is supposed to cure everything, to heal all wounds. Franoise Lebrun is acutely severe, precisethus evoking Laud's childhood attraction to hospital nurses. He thought them alluring because they seemed cold and hard, impervious to pain. She asks if he's ever seen a pair of lungs, adding that they're pretty because they're pink.Toward the end, Miss Lebrun has one long drizzling aria of remorseabout the futility of sex without love. It's her only opportunity to act; otherwise, both women are allowed to alternate rapt but blank stares with faint, indulgent smiles, while Laud lectures about nothing. (Miss Lafont gets a chance to throw up too, but very quickly. Laud's monologues are spiced with maxims intended to knock us sideways. Such as: ""In the long run, the phonier you are, the further you go."" (Holden, you should be with us at this movie.) Or: ""My only dignity is cowardice."" And: ""Women always belong to their rescuers""  such as their abortionists.It's worth worrying about Laud these days  as to whether he can do his best for directors other than Truffaut. Godard and Bertolucci have already brought out the aridity that also withers his persona in ""The Mother and the Whore,"" and it's rather sad to see this dour, fatigued appearance so soon after hugely enjoying his skill in Truffaut's ""Day for Night."" But all we learn from his performance in this movie is that his right nipple twitches violently when he's dialing a phone.All in all, it's tempting to mail the director a list of complaints as long as his movie. What possessed him to use slow dissolves when we yearn for quick cuts? Or to give us a tour of the inside of a refrigerator or lessons in putting records on turntables or how to make a call? And occasionally, when Eustache builds toward a scene that might be almost interestingin which these weary people might have to cope with one another  he leaves it out. The program notes report that he ""now hates most films."" So this picture may be his vengeance on the apes who like them. But perhaps he was paying homage to Gore Vidal's Myra Breckinridge, who had ""a radical theory"" that ""boredom in the arts can be, under the right circumstances, dull.""",1973-10-06T05:00:00+0000

At the time of writing, it seems likely that a whole tradition of British politics will finally come to an end in the aftermath of the LambtonJellicoe scandals. Lord Lambton, a handsome, debonair aristocrat with two stately homes, about 40,000 acres in the north of England and an inherited fortune of some $25million, occupied the Government post of Under Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force almost by inherited right. He was one of a small number of token aristocrats included in the present Conservative administration as a symbol of continuity and social respectability. He carried the duties and privileges of Government office as lightly and as casually as the various other duties which may fall upon great landowners in Englandthe president of his local football club, perhaps, or the chancellorship of his local university. Certainly, he would never allow these things6e interfere with his serious pleasures, and Lord Lambton belonged to a tradition of pleasureloving aristocrats which is as old as human history. It is not, however, a tradition which survives easily in the present decade, with its constant exposure of men in public life. When Lord Lambton allowed himself to be photographed in bed smoking pot with two prostitutes, one of them colored, and Lord Jellicoe, a senior Cabinet officer, confessed in the same week to having relations with prostitites, the storm broke.",1973-10-07T05:00:00+0000

He hadn't space for more because of the commentary that he appended to each, and it's a good thing, too, because his commentary is as succinct and various as eny criticism being written anywhere. He isn't just extraordinarily intelligent; he is that fine phenomenon, a loving critic. So much of the energy of criticism seems to be drawn from bile and feuds with other critics or envy of the artist's reputation and the pursuit of celebrity. (Movie critics at the moment, being in the public eye, are guiltiest.) Here, though, the insights arise from enthusiasm for the medium and its luminaries and, since photography has been a poor relation among the arts from the beginning, Szarkowski hasn't been elbowed in his ruminations by a dozen hasty rivals.

us,Light box in the woods,"It began with an elementary exercise in geometry, the combination of a long rectangle and a parallelogram. But what finally emerged was anything but simplea sophisticated, modern home of unusual form, inside and out. The architects, Mayers & Schiff, call this year  round vacation house in Westchester a parallel light box, a reference to its eastern facade set off between angled side walls and containing a huge, twostory window. This wall of windows, with its sweeping view of the surrounding forest, helps give the building one of its dominant characteristics, a feeling of openness. So does the spacious, twostory corridor that runs from the kitchen, past dining area and living room to the opposite end of the building, where the study is tucked in overhead. Along this corridor the architects have suspended strips of theater lights, painted a schoolbus yellow; at night they brighten the entire area, shining through the windows and lighting up the grounds beyond. Throughout, the supporting columns have been left freestanding, not enclosed in walls. This converts the lower level, in effect, into a single large room serving the functions of living room, dining room and kitchen. Besides the study, there are three bedrooms on the upper level. These open off a balcony which overlooks the lofty corridor. In addition to the openness of the house, the family especially likes the odd nooks and crannies which the geometry of the building has created: an alcove beside the fireplace, for example, and the upstairs studyloft. The bedrooms, too, have privacy and are closed off, with eyelevel windows (visible in the view of the west facade below).

At one point, indeed, he reminisces with other Jewish leaders about crucial decisions and battles, as newsreel shots sketch out Israel's 25-year history.The result is an anniversary tribute to Israel and a good, thumbnail refresher course in history. But it is the personal exchanges of Mr. Ben-Gurion with such colleagues as Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Abba Eban and Zalman Shazar  wise, warm and wryly amusing  that make this movie so winning. As they recount sad, turbulent times, even noting personal dissensions, they reflect the detachment of key people who had significant jobs to do.The film takes the former Premier from Jaffa, where he landed from Russia, to the sites of the Six Day War. These scenes have been directed unpretentiously but effectively by Simon Hesera. Mr. Ben-Gurion interestingly postscripts some footage of his visits with American leaders, including a deferential young Richard M. Nixon.Of a smiling Dwight D. Eisenhower, he says, ""A good man but I wouldn't have voted for him."" Of John F. Kennedy: ""Such a boy and one of their best Presidents.""Near the film's end, Mr. Ben-Gurion is shown in his home library, in the desert kibbutz where he has retired, discussing his memoirs. And at the fade-out, and the most moving thing in this admirable close-up, the old man and a young Israeli boy talking together, cross a field toward the horizon.",1973-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Herzog speaking up for life, warmly and movingly? He may speak up for life, but it's through an acknowledgment of outrages, often lovingly inventoried. Herzog is not a simple film maker. The emotions evoked by his films arc never easily categorized, nor, I think, are they meant to be.""Land of Silence and Darkness"" is no exception. It seems, at its beginning, a rather conventional documentary about the efforts of a middle-aged German woman named Fini Straubinger, who went blind at 15 and deaf at 18, to help other blind-deaf people. Fini travels around Germany doing good with alarming self assurance.Her cheery efforts are most easily appreciated by people who've gone deaf and blind later in life, after they've had the use of those two senses. Later on we see the efforts fail totally with people who've been born blind and deaf, since theirs is a world incomprehensible to even a do-gooder with Fini's energy and optimism. This is the note that concludes the film, which is not exactly the philosophy of ""The Sound of Music.""Herzog is fascinated by grotesques, which he makes us see as object lessons in a perverse universe. A key to the irony with which Herzog invests this so-called warm and moving subject is contained in the film's title. As Fini tells us in the course of the movie, the deaf are not even allowed the comfort of silence: the head is full of strange buzzing and cracking sounds. The eyes, though incapable of seeing, are continually assaulted by lights, shadows and colors. Total darkness is a sighted person's poetic conceit.Herzog, one of the most talented of the new young German film directors, will one day make a movie that's as interesting to sit through as to argue about later. ""Land of Silence and Darkness"" is not it.",1973-10-09T05:00:00+0000

His life, of which only the most general details are known, is the take-off point for the massive, oddly elliptical Russian film that was shown last night at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center and will be shown there again tonight.""Andrei Rublev"" has had a curious history. Verifying facts about it is only slightly less difficult than authenticating some of the paintings that have been attributed to Rublev.This much is known: the film, which was being shown privately in Moscow in 1967, was presented out of competition at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival by the owner of the French distribution rights but against the official wishes of the Russians, who reportedly felt that one of its themesthe artist trying to make sense within a brutalizing worldhad embarrassing contemporary parallels.When it was shown at Cannes, the film was almost three hours, although it was said to have been cut. Last night at Alice Tully Hall, the running time was 2 hours and 26 minutes. This should be pointed out, I think, to explain the certain disadvantage under which we must judge it. How much of the film's highly praised free form is the intention of the director or simply a result of an editor's itchy fingers? I'm not sure.The film I saw was free in narrative form, all right, but almost DeMille-heavy in style. This is most apparent in the huge spectacle scenes that show us the Tartars pillaging and raping with great, old-fashioned gusto (""I saw a town,"" one Tartar chief explains to another, ""and couldn't resist""), and, at another point, drop Andrei into the midst of a pagan orgy where, it seems, he suffers a fate more provocative than death. That is, for a monk.The film is presented in a series of separate chapters, or panels, not unlike those in an iconostasis, that especially Russian collection of icons (developed in Rublev's day) that form a screen between the sanctuary of a church and the nave. In some panels Andrei (Anatoli Solonitzine) is barely visible, a minor character; in others he is in the foreground although he is seldom more than the passive recorder of the events around him, as we are.In this fashion, I assume, we are meant to share the passions, sorrows and doubts that shaped the artist, but since there always seems to be more going on in the head of the film's director than in the head of the man playing Andrei, the system did not work for me. I wondered, for example, how the director got a horse to fall down stairs. Was the horse hurt? That sort of question takes precedence over questions of esthetics.Andrei Tarkovsky, the director whose ""My Name Is Ivan"" was released here in 1963, spares us most of the usual movie-nonsense talk about art and the artist, and he never once shows us Andrei's trying to decide whether to use blue paint or green. He also has created a couple of impressive individual sequences, including the preparations for, and casting of, a giant church bell, and the opening sequence in which Andrei witnesses the desperate revels of a group of peasants who have taken refuge in a barn during a storm.Unfortunately, Tarkovsky also has a particularly Russian eye for movie lyricism, which is not very interesting: a fondness for sun-created halos, rain, snow, rushing streams and air filled with dandelion fluff, all those clichs that more frequently evoke the moviemaker's fatigue than his poetic sensibility.However, I hedge my comments in the knowledge that I've not seen the film that Tarkovsky made. This ""Andrei Rublev"" says not much more about the trials of the artist than does Truffaut's ""Day for Night,"" which manages the feat without any impalings and with no dandelion fluff.",1973-10-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Satyajit Ray's Moving 'Distant Thunder':The Cast,"The Bengali countryside is almost heavy with color, with golds, yellows, umbers, and especially with the greens of the rice fields. The village is tranquil. Caste is observed. It is part of the order of things. Occasionally groups of airplanes are heard overhead, but they are as remote as the war that, according to a village elder, ""the king is fighting with the Germans and the Japanese."" One villager reports the Germans have captured Singapore, but he is corrected. It's the Japanese who have captured Singapore, the man is told.Aside from a shortage of kerosene, the war, at first, doesn't seem to have much effect on the villagers in Satyajit Ray's fine, elegiac new film, ""Distant Thunder"" (Ashani Sanket). The movie, which has the impact of an epic without seeming to mean to, was shown last night at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. It will be presented there again tonight.""Distant Thunder"" has all sorts of connections with Ray's great Apu Trilogyits village setting, its leading actor, Soumitra Chatterji, who played the title role in ""The World of Apu,"" and its source material. The new film, like the Apu Trilogy, is based on a novel by Bibhuti Bhusan Bannerji. It is, however, very different from those early films.It is the work of a director who has learned the value of narrative economy to such an extent that ""Distant Thunder,"" which is set against the backdrop of the ""manmade"" famine that wiped out 5 million people in 1943, has the simplicity of a fable.Though its field of vision is narrow, more or less confined to the social awakening of a young village Brahmin and his pretty, naive wife, the sweep of the film is so vast that, at the end, you feel as if you'd witnessed the events from a satellite. You've somehow been able to see simultaneously the curvature of the earth and the insects on the blades of field grass.""Distant Thunder"" is about Gangacharan (Mr. Chatterji), the only Brahmin in his village, a solemn and rather pompous young man who accepts the responsibilities as well as the privileges of caste. As teacher, physician and priest he looks forward to the material rewards due him. When Ananga, his wife, asks him if he really can ward off cholera through spells, for which neighboring villagers will pay him handsomely, he replies that, in addition to the spells, he will pass on to the villagers the practical information from his hygiene encyclopedia.As the war-induced rice shortage becomes increasingly acute, the tranquillity of the village is destroyed. Life-long trusts are betrayed. Civil order falls apart. At the same time, the famine prompts some remarkable instances of love and compassion. The self-assured Gangacharan, who wears black-rim spectacles and carries a black umbrella, is at first angry when his wife proposes that she go to work to earn rice for them. Then he says quietly: ""If we have to humble ourselves, it's best we do it together.""As the scramble to survive humiliates some of Ray's characters, it ennobles others, including Gangacharan who, towards the end, has begun to question the social system that he has always accepted as given and right. In the context of the film, this is a revolutionary conversion, and a most moving one.Ray has chosen to photograph the film in rich, warm colors, the effect of which is not to soften the focus of the film but to sharpen it. The course of terrible events seems that much more vivid in landscapes of relentless beauty.",1973-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Women in Love:The Cast,"""My heart is sore as if it had been stabbed"": that kind of imagery may pass in Germany, but stab-wise New Yorkers know that wounded hearts don't lounge around, they go to Bellevue. Even those who love pain will be frustrated by ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" shown last night at the New York Film Festival.Throughout, the cruelty creaks and the sobs sound forcedyou might call it sawdust suffering. Petra (Margit Carstensen), a successful fashion designer, plays slavemaster to her secretary, barking out orders""Get my shoes!""in a style that fails to match Joan Crawford's in ""The Best of Everything.""The slave winces with mute gratitude until their stable relationship is disrupted by a younger woman. Then the secretary's typewriter clatters with agitation while Petra seduces the newcomer. You can see the next scene coming like an avalanche: there's going to be a role reversal here. So Petra becomes a slave to the sulky model who says she needs men ""from time to time"" and soon returns to her husband.In response, Petra gets sloshed all over a white fur floor, stamps on her antique tea set, announces that she'd like to die, to sleep . . . (no, she's not going to dream), and ruins her own birthday party. Hung over, she resolves to be nicer to her secretary, who exits at onceapparently appalled by even a hint of kindness.""Bitter Tears"" almost contributes to film historyit's like an anthology of movie chestnuts culled from the last 50 years. It would be even more enlightening if the director (R. W. Fassbinder) had been born in the eighteen-nineties instead of 1945. Still, we get a flood of lavish facial expressions from silent movies. The actresses grin or smoulder extravagantly, heave their shoulders high in poignant shrugs. There's also the old gimmick of peering intently into a mirror while making a long slow speech about the past.And obviously, Mr. Fass-binder, thinks that women flirt like mastodons. Every gesture, each glance, any phrase is freighted with significanceeven ""Would you . . . like coffee"" or ""I used to like ... mathematics."" And eyes have to freeze between the simplest of sentences. But my favorite relic from bad old pictures is the (deeply emotional) monologue delivered by someone who has her cheek pressed against the upper back of the lucky listener, while the latter stares into space. This occurs three times in the movie, surely a record for the shoulder blade as amplifier.All the right props are presenta Siamese cat, baldheaded unclothed mannequins, a quasi-Renaissance mural of far-flung nudes more wigs than you ever saw at a demolition sale, plus seasonable slave clothes: metallic breast cups, throttling gold collars, a bare back with a latticework of chains. And there's traditional wisdom, too, such as: ""A woman has her trumps, but she has to play them."" Or, ""Where terror reigns, markind is puny."" And, ""Everyyone needs consolation.""Clearly, the director was awash in his fantasies about lesbianism. He worked hard on decadence (gin at breakfast, fur on anything,) and strugged to create a lush, weird setting for inevitable remorse. He wants the audience to remember how terribly unnatural, this all is. Hence, his women look like no one you'd ever meet, and he has filmed them under lighting that makes them look pastier and stranger than anyone encountered by flashlight in a sewer.Despite a few lines like ""Woman must fight for her place in this world,"" don't let it be rumored that this is a liberated movie. Instead, it should be regarded as a chronicle of blunders that film-makers have repeated throughout the decades.",1973-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Knopf. $15.,"In a famous essay Henry James called Balzac the master of us all . . . the very type and model of the projector and creator; so when I think, either with envy or with terror, of the nature and the effort of the Novelist, I think of something that reaches its highest expression in him. Yet as V. S. Pritchett reminds us in this new illustrated biography, Balzac often seemed like a figure from a fairy tale: the secretary of the Russian Embassy in Paris described him as a little fat man, greasy, with the face of a baker, the clothes of a cobbler, the hide of a cooper, the manners of a stocking salesman and the smock of an innkeeper. One awestruck young novelist Saw him as a goodhumored wild boar, his paunch quivering with laughter and whose fullblooded lips exposed scattered teeth like fangs. But it's a gay young provincial hosiess who wins Pritchett's praise for the very best portrait of Balzac in action:",1973-10-14T05:00:00+0000

In the chaos that The Times erupted, about 30 people required firstaid treatment, five required hospital treatment. Only five, shrugged an apologist for the Mets' rowdies. But it was five too many. Winning a pennant was once an occasion in New York for happiness and pride. Now it's an excuse for lawlessness and fear.

Her autobiography is a manyfaceted collage of surreal fanatasies and erotic dreams, of journal excerpts and poetry, of clawing anger and fathomless love. There is not a sentimental sentence in the book, and it is very, very candid indeed. Some disciples of Tillich may indeed feel the book is entirely too candid, or at least premature. I do not. Tillidh was my teacher, and I admired him without measure. But after Leading this unadorned account of what it was like to try to live with him, I now know and respect him more than ever.",1973-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Secrets of lowcost building,"Building has become next to impossible for most people because of skyrocketing construction costs. Lumber has gone up 40 to 100 per cent. Land prices have inflated right along with hamburger prices. Mortgages and construction loans have dried up. And yetpeople are building houses. The tvio shown here originally cost under $15,000 (about $22,000 today but still a bargain). Plus plenty of imagination and hard work. (Since labor accounts for up to 60 per cent of the average building budget, doingityourself or with your friends is a tremendous costwhittler.) The silo on this page and the builder's shell structure opposite were both prefabricated buildings that were adapted by the owners. Next week, we will show three lowcost, architectdesigned houses that can be builtor mostly builtby the owner. One of them, the cottage at right, is being built singlehandedly by a young woman. Mr. and Mrs. Louis Audette purchased a standard grain silo from the Unadilla Silo Company for $2,300 in 1969 (today it would cost approximately $2,600) and put it up on their site in Marlboro, Vt., themselves with friends on weekends. To the basic barrel, the Audettes added dormer windows and slit windows in the front walls, a floor and stairwell between the levels. The house is not electrified as the family enjoys a typical 19thcentury farm existence on weekends. The total cost including the outside well and a ha/fmi/e road was $4,700. They plan to add on another silo drum for a large living room in the future. Shocked by custom building costs, Architect Ronald Kolbe and his wife stopped at a roadside builder's model display of homes to see what made the shell houses so cheap. (Some models started at $6,900). The answer, they found, was strict adherence to standard lumberyard items and installation, which allowed the builder to let out, work to small subcontractors with no supervision and low overhead. Kolbe designed a house for their site in Springs, Long Island, that stayed within these limitations and had the shell builder put it up. Their twobedroom weekend house, insulated for yearround use, cost them $15,000 when completed in 1969. (He estimates that it would cost $22,000 to build a comparable house today.) That figure included the septic tank, rough grading of the site and the prefab fireplace. The ground level of concrete blocks (now overgrown with vines) offers space for a future studio. The deck overhang forms a carport.",1973-10-14T05:00:00+0000

But the ice was always, there, just on the horizon, and even On the warmest days, when the thermometer nudged the sixties, the merest breeze was Chill with winter.",1973-10-14T05:00:00+0000

""The Paper Chase,"" directed by James Bridges and adapted by him from John Jay Osborn Jr.'s novel, is different. It takes longer, almost the entire film.""The Paper Chase,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia I Theater, doesn't go wrong exactly. It goes slowly soft like a waxwork on a hot day, losing the shape and substance that at the beginning have rightfully engaged our attention.The film is about the trials and triumphs of a bright young Harvard Law School student named Hart (Timothy Bottoms) during his first year of combat in Cambridge. Hart is from the Middle West (University of Minnesota), and finds himself initially intimidated and then challenged by the history and traditions of the Ivy League fortress.Hart is a very appealing, very rare sort of fellow to find in an American film these days. He's actually interested in learning, not just for the material rewards that may follow, but for the power of the intellect to impose order on the chaos that most of us muddle through. Hart's hero is Professor Kingsfield, a brilliant, irascible old professor of contract law, marvelously well played by the theatrical and film producer-director-writer John Houseman.On the first day of classes, Kingsfield haughtily informs the students that they've come to him with their heads full of mush and that he intends to train their minds. It isn't many movies that even acknowledge the existence of a mind, much less take it seriously.Kingsfield has what is, in effect, a contract with his students, an agreement to turn them into first-class lawyers in return for their dedication to learning. He pushes them, bullies them, ridicules them, ""Fill this classroom with your intelteligence,"" he tells Hart, who gets sick to his stomach. He treats the students as if they were abstractions. There's no sentiment in his discipline.So far so good. But then the movie itself shows symptoms of the kind of sentimentality you know people like Kingsfield (and probably Hart, too) would have no patience with. Hart begins an affair with Susan (Lindsay Wagner) a pretty, independent girl who turns out to be Kingsfield's daughter and a rather inconsistent fictional character.Susan, the estranged wife of an earlier law school student, a drop-out with whom she's been bumming around Europe, spends most of her time scolding Hart for his obsessive scholasticism, though she has earlier told Hart she was fed up with her rootless, disorganized life with her husband.At this point ""The Paper Chase"" gets stickier and stickier. Even Hart's awe of the law, at first so refreshing, becomes soppy. You begin to suspect him to be the sort who weeps at the sight of books, but never reads them.There's a dreadful subplot involving a boy who isn't going to pass (remember the kid who used to get washed-out of flight training school in Air Force movies of the thirties and forties?) and a romantic soundtrack score, toned up from time to time with snatches of Bach, that makes the score for ""Love Story"" sound like Mozart.It takes a long while for ""The Paper Chase"" to disintegrate, and there are some funny, intelligent sequences along the way, but by the end it has melted into a blob of clichs.",1973-10-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Ozu's 'Late Autumn' Like a Day in the Sun:The Cast,"""I'm happy as I am"": you might not think that a radical sentence, but it's the challenge hurled in Yasujiro Ozu's marvelous ""Late Autumn"" by a young woman who's just cheerfully announcing that she's not ready for marriage. Her seniors respond with shocked determination and commit themselves to selecting a husband at once.The situation that sets so many feelings aboil is ironically simple. A recently dead man's male friends are worried about the future of his widow (whom they all mooned over when young) and her daughter. The well-meaning meddlers become disruptive intruders as they try to make matches for the daughter, then for the mother. Meanwhile, both women cling to the quite blameless freedoms that they've been enjoying on their own.""Late Autumn,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker, was made in 1960. (Ozu died in 1963.) Hence the struggles between the generations pre-date the clashes of the late nineteen-sixties. However, Ozu's extraordinary sensitivity makes them deeply dramatic, all the more so because these gentle, reflective persons seem to have led unruffled lives.The young woman at first appears submissive; then rebels against the notion of an arranged marriage to a stranger. But later she seems more traditional and old-fashioned than her elders, when she violently protests against a rumored remarriage for her mother. She insists that it would be ""filthy"" and ""disgusting,"" because it would dishonor her father's memory.This is a creature caught between the past and the present. Her modern self rejects the conception of marriage as a mere exercise in forebearance. She also devastates older listeners when she remarks that love and marriage don't always go together. Yet, when facing the fact that her mother might embrace a new life, she's horribly upset by the rift with old conventions.Despite the headshakes of parents deploring their, disobedient children, plus their admission that the newest generation has nothing in common with themselves when young, Ozu also shows that the children's approval is terribly important to the adults. Moreover, the offspring are acutely possessive of their parentsa startling concept for an American audience.The theme of Westernization is subtle throughout. Of course, there are bottles of Johnny Walker and infinite plaid fabrics, inevitable motor bikes and T-shifts. But there are also telling moments when young women in collegiate clothes alternate between the tiny, floating steps conditioned by wearing kimonos and striding freely in their high heels and Western skirts. Again, you sense that Ozu was studying a generation in transitionthose who were often torn between traditions and the powerful instinct that it was time to overturn them. And the older generation's efforts to sculpture the young only clench the latter's resistance to the models offered to them.Since Ozu concentrates so much on the interior consciousness, ""Late Autumn"" is closer to fiction than to film. As usual, Ozu uses a fairly stationary camera, which rests on the faces of those who are talking.Love is hardly mentioned when the subject of marriage arises. But enormous affection between parents and children, and among old friends, is revealed as it rarely is on screen: often, it's shown through the small jokes that intimates make at one another's expense.Finally, the daughter marries. The mother, asserting that she ""can't start all over again from scratch,"" eludes the pressures from her well-wishers, and smiles at the solitude ahead of her. Beautifully acted throughout, especially by Setsuko Hara as the mother, and Yoko Tsukasa as the daughter, ""Late Autumn"" stresses that people can't forcibly control the lives of others, not even in the name of fond intentions.",1973-10-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Belmondo, a Bogart of His Own, in 'Inheritor':The Cast","How the French love usat least, a number of their movies say they do. New York has the glamour now, not Paris; indeed, the filming of the French capital in ""The Inheritor,"" which opened last night at the 68th St. Playhouse and the UA Eastside Cinema, tries to make their city look as much like ours as possible. Glass buildings, clamorous demolition and construction, cranes, chrome reflected in chrome: it's our shiniest surfaces that beguile some Europeans.You no longer hear them accusing us of forcing the most commercial aspects of our culture on them. Instead, they reproduce the trappings eagerlyin the name of the vitality we're said to have.Along with exultant shots of administrators striding through a factory, there are enthusiastic references to ""la technique Kennedy,"" and a Harvard degree is as flashy a product as the pocket calculators that the French tycoons brandish. Yet, one of the charms of this movie is that we can enjoy the borrowed slickness, because it has been romanticized by uncritical French eyes.No shabbiness here, no urban glut or rot, no apathy or fatigue; the American style projected by director Philippe Labro evokes a confident, glossy world of action where everything is new.This delightful thriller casts Jean-Paul Belmondo against type: as a businessman combatting the murderous intrigues of international financiers. (He's also supposed to have a radical concern for the rights of workers, but we can't believe thatsince this is a hymn to capitalism.)Belmondo at 40, buttoned into an executive suit? Yet he's the same headlong ruffian we first saw in ""Breathless,"" and when he impatiently rips a Band-Aid off his bullet wound, the calculated incongruity of his role seems almost like a joke between him and the audience. And he still pulls down the corners of his mouth in the quick, disgusted smile that Bogart used.More than ever, we can see what he learned from (and loved in) Bogart's acting. But he's never been a mimic. Instead, a living talent has perpetuated certain qualities of a dead one, while continuing to flourish on his own.There's always that wide stripe of lunacy in Belmondo: the resilient clown prepared to be outrageous, ready to throw a stinkbomb or to provide pratfalls for others, and that trait has nothing to do with Bogart. But although we will see many apings of Belmondo, it's doubtful that anyone will catch the spark of Bogart preserved in him.Seduced by history, the director did make one slip: one of Belmondo's girlfriends (Maureen Kerwin) is made to imitate Lauren Bacall in ""To Have and Have Not."" But she can't even inhale like Bacall, let alone touch her performance.However, I'll forgive anything for one detail in this picture: at the graveyard where Belmondo's father is being buried, a sinister figure appears with one hand sunk in the pocket of his trench coat. Moviegoers over 4 know what that means: there's a gun that's about to shoot. Then the hand pulls out . . . a package of cigarettes. (Again, the French learned that from us. The apparent assassin is revealed to be an investigative reporter, who soon displays the heroism inseparable from his profession.This exuberant entertainment has a silly, sham-tragic ending. But until then it throbs with the energy and the rueful gaiety that Belmondo brings to almost any part, and that's worth even the cost of tickets these days.",1973-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Howzer' Shown at the Whitney Museum:The Cast,"The fantasies about the world in the minds of youngsters is explored with delicacy and compassion in ""Howzer,"" which began a two-week premiere engagement yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art. While its probing into the inner drives of a runaway brother and sister may not be especially deep, this first film effort of Kenneth Laurence, its writer-director, his colleagues and a willing cast is an arresting illustration of a serious, if simple, theme executed with polish and dedication.In essence, ""Howzer"" concentrates on the adventures of 12-year-old Howard (Howzer) and 14-year-old Debora, who flee from seeming parental restraints and comfortable, middle-class suburbia toward the glorious horizons of Los Angeles via comfortable Pullman accommodations. What they discover, of course, is that the world is not so safe as home nor so beautiful as their dreams or the mountain country they travel after leaving the train.A viewer might reasonably question the extraordinary nature of the people and experiences that finally shake and traumatize these innocents. Very few kids, after all, are likely to run into a moody hunter and his adult, retarded son. Nor are they likely to be befriended by a hippy amateur artist and his girl, who run a lonely tavern where they are exposed to death for the first time.One might also wonder about the somewhat thin reasons for their trek west. School, it's intimated, is a bore for Howzer. Debora is equally disenchanted. Mom and Dad don't understand, etc.But Edmund Gilbert and Allyn Ann McLerie make believable parents fumbling for communication with their laconic children. And in making their debuts, Peter Desiante, as Howzer, who never loses his yen for freedom, and Melissa Stocking, who does, are impressively natural and curious as the wandering offspring.As professionals, Royal Dano, William Gray, Virgil Frye and Olive Deering as the hunter his son, the artist and his girl, contribute smooth, low-key portrayals of unusual types.The small world of Howzer and company, as seen through Bruce Logan's scenic color photography, is slightly flawed, but it is worth watching.",1973-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,' I. F. Stone's Weekly' Is a Film Delight,"It's only 62 minutes long. It was photographed in black and white with a religious austerity. It has no theme music. It is a documentary, and its title sounds like something glimpsed on an index card at the Public Library.Yet Jerry Bruck Jr.'s ""I. F. Stone's Weekly,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, is such a thorough delight it left me feeling the way other people said they felt after seeing ""The Sound of Music."" That is, quite high.I should admit that ""The Sound of Music"" depressed me. It evoked civilization's imminent collapse. It made me think of the Chinese Communists and suspect that they'd be taking us over sooner rather than later. What was the use of thought or reason? Our minds have already turned into mashed potatoes.Or have they?Not, I think, as long as Isadore Feinstein Stone is on the American scene, passionately exposing the fallacies, double-talk and ignorance of the various rascals in Government, elected, appointed or there simply because of being someone's friend.I. F. Stone, now 66, has been a maverick all his life, a Communist anarchist in his youth, once described as ""a strident voice of illiberalism"" by Spiro T. Agnew, and now self-defined as a counter-revolutionary.Through it all, he has been the ferocious conscience of American journalists and those American citizens who would listen to him in person or who subscribed to his newsletter, which he started in 1952 and finally folded in 1971, when he moved his often dumfounded prose to the New York Review of Books.""I. F. Stone's Weekly"" is no dopey paean to a great man. Supplemented by a modest, informative commentary spoken by Tom Wicker, the film presents Izzy Stone straight, with all his eccentricities and enthusiasms intact, in interviews, in public speeches and even walking down to the corner to stuff a week's issue into the post box.We listen to Izzy describe a hilarious early confrontation with the Atomic Energy Commission (about underground testing), requiring him to make a visit to some seismology experts in the Commerce Department's Coast and Geodetic Survey. ""They were so glad to see a reporter. I don't think they'd seen a reporter since there was a tremble from Mount Ararat, when Noah's Ark landed.""He describes the danger for Washington correspondents who become pals with statesmen (""You begin to understand there are certain things the public ought not to know""). He talks about his own lean years as a blacklisted reporter and the genesis of his weekly, through which he taught all the rest of us how to find stories within stories, through inconsistencies, through information inadvertently made public but unnoticed by other reporters.The film brilliantly succeeds in communicating Stone's near-obsessive interest in truth and his optimism. The war in Vietnam, he suggests, and the survival of the Vietnamese people through years of bombing have re-established ""the primacy of man in an age of technology.""Toward the end Stone tells a group of students: ""I really have so much fun I ought to be arrested."" There is more to that statement than sentimental fondness for his profession. A cub reporter, he says, may get so excited covering a big fire that he forgets that something really it burning.As Jerry Bruck Jr. is lucky to have a subject as dynamic as Stone, so is Stone lucky to have a young film maker as persistent and as obsessed, in his way, as Bruck. ""I.F. Stone's Weekly"" has been three years in the making, on a shoestring, and in bits and pieces. The result is a rare film, a fitting tribute to a man who never gives up.",1973-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: For Anglophiles:' Optimist' Tells Tale of the Other London,"Before proceeding to review ""The Optimists,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, there are a few confessions I feel obligated to make.I am an unabashed Anglophile.I have been carrying on a torrid love affair with London for 18 years and expect it to endure for the rest of my life.I have recently been thinking about trying to lay my hands on some recordings of old English music hall tunes.Having said all that, I can now comfortably go on to say that I wallowed with porcine delight in ""The Optimists."" Its principal ingredients are an old busker (street entertainer) with a head full of music hall songs and jests, a couple of slum children and their poverty-calloused parents, a pair of dogs and London itself.A little bit of it is the London of touriststhe West End; but much of it is London south of the river, the London of Thames-side garbage dumps, looming power stations, squalid housing erected some 80 years ago and the new council flats that are the hope of a more comfortable life for thousands of people. And the director of photography Larry Pizer, has caught it all, and more, with a loving eye.On the level of story, ""The Optimists,"" with songs and music by Lionel Bart, is the sort of old-fashioned excursion into sentiment that ought to warm the hearts of parents in search of that elusive piece of merchandise that goes under the name of good family entertainment.Peter Sellers, with a wardrobe of old music hall clothes, a talented but aged dog named Bella and a pram he pushes around London, plays the lonely, idiosyncratic old busker. And commendably, he submerges himself sufficiently in the part to allow old Sam to have a life of his own.David Daker and Marjorie as a London schoolgirl recruited for her role, is pure enchantment as the elder of the two children (John Chaffey plays her little brother) who befriend the busker and learn from him a little bit about the magic of life.David Daker and Marjorie Yates are letter-perfect in the thankless roles of the parents too busy surviving to worry about magic.""People like you bring kids into the world, don't know what they're all about,"" Sellers says.

There are people in back and in front of the orchestra. One would expect such a hall not to be satisfactory, and in fact I expected much worse. But the players in the or chestra could hear one another, and there was enough reverberation to produce a fairly elegant sound.

The image is apt. In the name of earthy exactitude, the translator may kill a poem by turning it into prose, but if he reaches heavenward to grasp its poetic essence, he will be pulled back by the knowledge that he has distorted its sense. So Mr. Kunitz, recognizing that Akhmatova's poems, like Pushkin's, do not depend on imitable effects but exist in the purity and exactness of their diction ... the subtlety of their rhythmic modulations, the integrity of their form, persists nevertheless in a venture he knows to be impossible, because he is one of those poets who are moved to record what [they] have heard, and to try to give it back in the language that [they] love.",1973-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Summer Wishes' Stars Joanne Woodward,"From time to time, there's a movie that makes you feel like a moderate heel. Although you respect the talents and the themes, it's not possible to respond emotionally, even though you might wish to. And that's the hitch with ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams,"" which opened last night at the Plaza Theater.Joanne Woodward ""plays a restive, well-tailored woman who has been married for 24 years to a devoted oculist (Martin Balsam). She has almost nothing to do but baby-sit for her daughter, lunch with her mother (Sylvia Sidney, bristling with fierce impatience: welcome back), redecorate her West End Avenue apartment, shop and fight with all her relatives.The mother's sudden death hastens a probably inevitable crisis. All of Miss Woodward's regrets about the past and her fantasies about the future erupt: She mourns what she has missed, dreads dying, wrestles with earlier experiences that can't be altered or recaptured, agonizes over the things that she may never do before she dies.This is a portrait of someone confronted by her own mortality, while watching the possibilities ahead diminish. Surely the subject is as valid as breathing. However, in the tradition of ""Rachel, Rachel"" and ""Gamma Rays,"" Miss Woodward has been directed to win the sweepstakes. Misery floods the screen. Yet, it's very hard to believe that the kind of vigorous, sinewy character she evokes could feel so perpetually defeated.Here, she plays much of her part at an unbroken level of irritation, slamming back at those around her with the gumption that's missing in our mayoral candidates, It's the same vitality that we saw in ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" and we recall the range of feelings that has streamed through a number of her pictures. But since she acts as if she had been drinking Drano, the moments of vulnerability just aren't convincing.Mr. Balsam, as the kindly, reassuring husband, is burdened with lines like, ""Do you know that you are more beautiful than the day I met you?"" and ""You can't do better than your best."" Again, we think wistfully of his brilliance in many other roles.But the alternate folksiness and banality of the script means that ""Summer Wishes"" is a forlorn waste of two fine character actors.",1973-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Voight in 'All-American Boy':The Cast,"Since old-style alienation is having a comeback, perhaps we'll soon get crinolines and quiz-show scandals as well. But the brand of mossy disaffection evoked in ""The All-American Boy,"" which opened last night at the Baronet, has nothing to do with politics or generations or rebellion. Instead, it belongs to the old I-can't-connect school. We've seen that so often on the screen that the theme needs a fresh twistwhich it doesn't get in this movie.Jon Voight is cast as a weary, resentful mid-American who hates his small hometown and doesn't want to commit himself to anything or anyone. However, in spite of himself, he succeeds as a fledgling boxer and is promised a great careeruntil he suddenly refuses to participate in the next big fight.He throws everything awayhis fiance as well as his future in boxing. But we never learn why. This picture flaunts such a stubborn disregard for characterization and motive that it could almost be billed as a mystery. For example, Voight is immediately established as a depressive. But there's no clue to whatever it is that keeps him staring broodily into space, rejecting intimacy or even contact with those around him. Charles Eastman, who wrote and directed the movie, absolutely refuses to explain what's biting his hero.The film is especially frustrating because Voight is such an intelligent actor. Remembering the variety that he brought to his previous roles, we can sympathize with the dilemmas he must have had in working with dialogue like this: ""What you thinkin'?"" ""I ain't thinkin' nothin'."" ""People are always thinkin' somethin'."" And when one of his girlfriends says that he smells like a cantaloupe, it's merciful that we don't have to see his face in close-up.But even in this picture, there are moments when Mr. Voight's quality comes through. He's very good at watching and listening, a skill that eludes many actors. He's also strong in showing his disgust at being treated like a slab of sirloin, when his boxer's body is displayed and examined by others.Mr. Eastman also did Mr. Voight a particular disservice by having someone say in an early scene that he looks like Marlon Brando. Throughout, you suspect that the actor was resisting the director's efforts to make him imitate Brando. True, Mr. Voight's gloomy, downward gaze sometimes suggests a slight similarity, and this is certainly an inarticulate part. But Mr. Voight, who hasn't yet played the same role twice, doesn't deserve to be shoved toward someone else's style of performing.",1973-10-25T05:00:00+0000

And Mitt a tour de force is the result!. How close Mr. Vidal has managed to stick to the actual historical record only two of his characters are invented (one is Charles Schuyler, a Jaw clerk and aspiring journalist who is the primary narrator of Burr, and whom Mr. Vidal identifies in his. Afterword as based roughly, or the obscure novelist Charles Burdett; the other is one William de la Touche Clancey, a Tory sodomite with a tongue that darts in and out of his mouth like a lizard's catching flies, who, Mr. Vidal assures us, could, obviously, be based on no one at all); as for the actual historical figures who appear in the novelonly in three minor cases are they not in the right places, on the right dates, doing what they actually did; and their conversations, though partly made up, always reflect the recorded views of the speakers.

us,The Screen:' Massacre in Rome' Is World War II Story,"Stars are generally an asset to a film. But in the case of ""Massacre in Rome,"" which opened yesterday at the National, Murray Hill and 86th Street East Theaters, they constitute its chief flaw.That is not to say that Marcello Mastroianni, as a principal priest and art restorer, and Richard Burton, as a German colonel in Rome as the Allies close in during World War II, give inept performances.It is simply that their presence at the moral summit of this film unbalances its recounting of a controversial and bloody fragment of history that began with the destruction by partisans of a German SS detachment on the Via Rasella and ended with a reprisal that took more than 300 Italian lives.The conflicts at the film's heart, the questions of where duty lies, of when the rules of war insult the souls of men beyond endurance, of when self-sacrifice becomes the ineluctable argument, become subsumed rather than illuminated by the interplay between two of the screen's more commanding presences.And when they are not at the center of events, Leo McKern, as General Maelzer, Burton's superior, is so busy chewing scenery in a performance that seems to call for a leash if not a muzzle, that it becomes impossible to take matters seriously.Directed by George Pan Cosmatos, ""Massacre in Rome"" is an opulent Carlo Ponti production with a warm eye for the spaciousness and beauty of the city's interiors and the panoply of its priesthood. The music, by Ennio Morricone, possesses all the subtlety of an elbow in the ribs.In the end, for all its apparent concern for life and death, ""Massacre in Rome"" turns out to be a curiously bloodless film, a monument not to its victims but to its stars.",1973-10-25T05:00:00+0000

Well, one starts with some perfectly magnificent photography by Jack Couffer.This camera work is so stunning that it immediately establishes a sensitive texture for a simply story of a roaming nonconformist with wings and a human voice. Intelligently and tastefully, the director-producer, Hall Bartlett, and the author, Richard Baoh, have integrated the bird's musings with arresting passages of silence and a surprisingly effective score sung by Neil Diamond, who composed it with Lee Holdridge.To one viewer, who loved the first half, the only catch is the final footage, when our feathered hero comes home to convert his old flock with some gummy platitudes. This portion is a bit pat and even synthetic, for all the clever photographic simulations of massed bird chatter and anger. This aspect of the movie, its technical manipulation, is at times remarkable.The picture also runs far too long. But the over-all flavor and impact remain striking, purposeful, sweet and at times heart-clutching. Jonathan, at least his human spokesman, generally says a mouthful. The comments are hardly new and too often humorless; nevertheless they fitted perfectly into this pictorial transformation from the printed page. Word and image made a combination that held this viewer.Maureen, another gull, tells Jonathan, ""you really are an exceptional flier."" Amen, J. L.",1973-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Black Hand Side':Stage's Brooks Family Arrives on Screen The Cast,"""Five on the Black Hand Side,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama and 86th Street Twin theaters, is amiable but realistic in attempting only to solve a few problems for a middle-class black family. But by tickling the funny bone, Charlie L. Russell's adaptation of his Off Broadway play is a good deal more effective than most of the militant and violent so-called black films that are getting redundant.In effect, the comedy is essentially the same as that staged by the American Place Theater in January of 1970, which delved into the harried home life of a barber who rules his wife, two sons and daughter as autocratically as Nero. His wife, of course, is more obedient servant than mate, and the communication between father and his grown, rebellious children is virtually nonexistent.Naturally, this domestic despotism is disrupted when the barber's meek but loving spouse, now at the end of her patience and faced with anxieties about her daughter's imminent marriage, revolts in comic women's lib style by demanding and getting her long-deferred rights.Mr. Russell's script may be a basically lightweight affair, but he writes with an affection and keen perception that make his people and the issues, couched either in jive talk or straight dialogue, three dimensional and pertinent. Credit for the giggles and truths is also due Oscar Williams, who directed with professional feeling for pace and comedy.But ""Five on the Black Hand Side"" also rests on its varied principals and the rich incidents that make its slight theme real and enjoyable.Leonard Jackson is properly outraged, pompous and funny as the barber who makes life with father a trial. Clarice Taylor, who is repeating her stage role as his wife, gives the once-timorous and now defiant Mrs. Brooks the finely underplayed indecision and dignity the part demands. She is entirely, convincing when she wryly observes that the family loves her husband ""but can't live with him.""Glynn Turman, D'Urville Martin and Bonnie Banfield are comically persuasive, as the embattled offspring. And a large cast, including Virginia Capers and Ja'Net Dubois, as helpful neighbors; as well as Sonny Jim and Carl Mikal Franklin and even Godfrey Cambridge, in a minute role, adds small delights to a modest but meaningful entertainment.",1973-10-26T05:00:00+0000

Fingernails are dirty; tough hands pass an idle moment stroking a kitten's fur; age announces itself in broken capillaries.The cast appears thoroughly responsive to Mr. Troell's commitments. Most deserving of praise are Mr. von Sydow and Miss Ullman as Karl Oskar, the farmer, and his wife Kristina; Monika Zetterlund as Ulrika, and Eddie Axberg as Karl Oskar's ill-fated brother, Robert.Although for anyone who has seen ""The Emigrants,"" this film will be enhanced by a pleasure akin to a reunion with old friends, ""The New Land"" is complete in itself.

But the early psychoanalytic critics, less hesitant than their master, systematically combed through the writings of famous authors for evidence of neuroses; such inquiries developed naturally from the romantic conception of the artistic character as being oversensitive or even diseased.

This. feat was not well regarded, and Burr was indicted for murder in New Jersey and New York. He continued, however, to preside over the Senate in Washington. Later, after a peculiarly futile expedition down the Mississippi, he was tried for treason on the grounds (probably correct) that he had attempted to detach the West from the Union.

Somewhat the same effect can be had at ground level at the Buena Vista, a swinging bar at 2765 Hyde Street, where you can buy oldfashioned steam beer. If weather permits you to see the Golden Gate Bridge, you will watch the fog drift through its towers, finally cloaking them perhaps, and then creep across the city to envelop Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill, hide Alcatraz Island and cover the tops of the financial district's towers. If you look to the south, you can see rows of traffic lights winding down the peninsula on which the city stands to Palo Alto and San Jose, while to the east traffic between Oakland and Sah Francisco fills the Bay Bridge.

us,Iceman' Film DoesJustice to the Play,"Just at the moment when many have been stripped of their national illusionsconcerning the purity of governmentEugene O'Neill's conviction that people cannot live without personal illusions comes through with a fresh tang of irony.As a drama for any and every decade, ""The Iceman Cometh,"" which opened yesterday at selected theaters, stresses that human dignity depends on dreams, even deceptions. Perhaps this is an especially American trait; many Europeans seem able to survive with fewer fantasies than we do.Reeking with failure, the unbudgeable barflies in O'Neill's 1912 saloon still manage to shore up shards of self-respect with their own private myths. The former radical pretends to despise the Movement that disappointed him, and claims that he's merely a detached observer of lifewhich isn't true. The bar's proprietor, who hasn't been outdoors for the 20 years since his wife died, vows that one day he'll walk through his old neighborhood. We know he won't. The bartender who insists that he's not a pimp, just because he bosses prostitutes, and the women themselves, who say that they're only tarts, not whores, the musty anarchist who knows that life will be lovely after the Revolution, the boozehounds who are going to give up drinking, the unemployables who will surely recapture their lost jobsall keep their rusty armor intact until they're manipulated by Hickey, the glib salesman who's determined to make them swallow the truth about themselves.Nearly crazed by Hickey's challenge, they all fall apart. Some also turn against one another, suddenly pulling a gun or a knife or a broken bottle on the former companions of nickel whisky. Hickey's machinations even start the Boer War going again, between two furious wrecks who fought on opposite sides. Moreover, Hickey has the gift of making others suicidal. But finally, when the group learns that he purged himself of pipe dreams only by killing his wife, most return gratefully to the illusions that kept them going.As Hickey, Lee Marvin has the salesman's slick authority, the talent for hustling his way across people's spiritual doorsills and invading their privacy. And we can believe in his ability to force their moods to change. As he lectures them about reality, Marvin achieves a maddening moral presenceboth jovial and righteous at once. Later, he's powerful in the rage of self-hatred, also when he relives the decision to commit murder.As one character says, Hickey has ""the fixed idea of the insane,"" and Marvin does convey that. However, his Hickey seems deliberately charmlessalthough the play demands a maniac spell-caster. Marvin's performance is just too rationally earthbound for a part that needs the touch of a magician.Fredric March as the saloonkeeper has a fine, befuddled childlike air, Moses Gunn is superb as a ravaged black rebel, and George Voskovec and Martyn Green fight splendidly together as the old warriors who share the rotgut. There's a moving glimpse of the late Robert Ryan as the exhausted ironist who waits for death; the stern pity he levels at others is tempered with an occasional youthful smile. And Tom Pedi, the pimping bartender, is deft at miming exaggerated patience.Jeff Bridges, the child of the Movement who delivered his revolutionary mother to the cops, begins well but eventually overplays. So do Evans Evans (the key streetwalker), Bradford Dillman as the shattered law school graduate, and several of the others. Those who overact may have been directed to do so because the play has one lumpy problem: how do you convey drunkenness and fatigue without losing vitality? It can be done, as we've seen on other occasions, but the question, tempts some performers to gnaw the scenery.Infinite care and thought and respect have been poured into this production. But the play doesn't flourish in film form for one reason: even the simplest camerawork breaks the continuity. We're supposed to see these people as one huddled mass, imprisoned together in the room they rarely leave, perpetually affected by one another's words or presence. Inevitably, closeups destroy that.We especially lose the impact of the ensemble during Hickey's last monologue. So we're denied the crowd's full recoil when he confesses to the killing, their collective efforts not to hear him, their agitation, their final relief in deciding that it's he who's crazy, not themselves. Admittedly, drunks don't make the world's best listeners. But here, the camera isolates them from the flow that O'Neill designed.So this isn't the ""Iceman"" of your lifetime. And there will be many who can't help recalling Jason Robards as Hickey; Robards is often regarded as the exclusive owner of that role. But the play is an inescapably great experience, and that fact isn't muffled by this film.",1973-10-30T05:00:00+0000
