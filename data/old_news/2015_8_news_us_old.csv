us,Syria: U.S. Sets New Sanctions," The United States sought to broaden its economic pressure on Syrias government on Monday, imposing sanctions on a far-flung network of seven overseas companies and four individuals for actions to evade American and European Union restrictions on fuel imports. The Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees enforcement of American sanctions, said seven commercial ships owned or controlled by one of the newly penalized companies had been blocked by its action, cutting off a potential source of fuel to President Bashar al-Assads military. The affected companies operated in Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Lebanon, Panama, St. Kitts and Nevis and the Marshall Islands, the Treasury said in a statement, asserting that many of these entities are front companies that the government of Syria and its supporters have used in an attempt to evade U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Any sanctioned individuals and entities risk seizure of assets under American jurisdiction, and are barred from commercial dealings with the United States.  ",2015-08-04T00:44:46+0000

And a blood bath, literal and figurative, ensues. For all its dexterity and assurance, the movie has its share of false notes and rhythmic stumbles, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. A few plot twists test the limits of credibility. And there is something a little dispiriting  if sadly unsurprising  about the way Mr. Chazelle turns a historically African-American art form into the existential arena for a couple of white guys. Still, he added, the battle of master and disciple is exciting and terrifying to witness, and, at its best, the film can feel as wild and spontaneous, as risky and precise, as a live jam session.",2015-08-04T05:00:03+0000

But if you go too fast, you work up a sweat and then catch a chill inside the church. Meursaults response conveys his overwhelming, and baffling, sense of imprisonment: She was right. There was no way out. Its an illustrative moment of the paralysis  damned if I do, damned if I dont  that characterizes so much of existential literature: Vladimir and Estragon, waiting for a God who never shows; the man from the country in the parable told by the priest in Kafkas The Trial, inert, cursing his fate and praying to fleas, waiting for the doorkeeper to admit him into the Law; Gregor Samsa, trapped between identities, unable to leave his house or return to his human condition. This existential paralysis emerges, in part, from spiritual crisis: If God is dead, what is the individuals role in an essentially meaningless universe?

The aid agencies, including the W.H.O., need $60.9 million to operate their health care centers in Iraq but have received only $5.1 million from donors. More than 184 centers serving refugees and other people displaced by violence in Iraq have suspended their operations, the W.H.O. said. The centers were the only health care providers in many parts of Iraq. This is a country ravaged by conflict, said Dr. Syed Jaffar Hussain, the W.H.O. representative in Iraq. Not only do we have innocent civilians being caught in the violence, with so many people fleeing the fighting and living in temporary housing, people are at much higher risk from communicable diseases. Unless additional funding is received, millions more will be deprived of health services they urgently need.

(Flix) FLIRTING WITH DISASTER (1996) Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller), a worker at the American Museum of Natural History and a new father, goes in search of his biological parents with the help of Tina (Ta Leoni), an adoption agency employee, and encounters a succession of oddballs in this comedy from David O. Russell. Patricia Arquette (above right, with, from left, Josh Brolin, Ms. Leoni, Mr. Stiller and Richard Jenkins) plays Mels wife, who is just getting her sexual footing back after the birth of their son and doesnt like Tinas flirty ways. Mary Tyler Moore plays the mother who raised Mel. She nags a lot and likes to show off her body. I want you to consider my age and ask yourself how I maintain this, she declares, lifting her sweater. Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin called the film a wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, adding that thanks to this filmmakers fine comic acumen, the payoff is always there. In The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), at 8 on Cinemax, Mr. Stiller, who also directed this adaptation of the James Thurber short story, stars as Walter, a dutiful drone in the photography department of Life magazine, who finds himself in a caper beyond his wildest imagination when the negative for the publications final print edition goes missing. Kristen Wiig plays the crinkly-nosed co-worker on whom Walter has a crush; Adam Scott is the leader of the new tech-jerk bosses who have Walters job on the line; and Sean Penn is the mysterious photographer behind Walters travels to Iceland, Afghanistan and other stunning far-off places. Though it is a celebration of modesty, there is also quite a lot of vanity in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. There is also a contradiction: An ordinary fellow should not have to be quite so special to win our admiration. ",2015-08-06T05:00:04+0000

But N.K. Jemisins intricate and extraordinary world-building starts with oppression: Her universes begin by asking who is oppressing whom, what they are gaining, what they fear. Systems of power stalk her protagonists, often embodied as gods and primeval forces, so vast that resistance seems impossible even to contemplate. When escape comes in her novels, it is not a merely personal victory, or the restoration of a sketchy and soft-lit status quo. Her heroes achieve escape velocity, smashing through oppressive systems and leaving them behind like shed skins.",2015-08-06T09:00:03+0000

Alfred Prufrock are fixed in a precise location: the cluttered space of my teenage bedroom floor. Its 1982. The light is low. The parquet tiles are coming unglued. Album covers  Talking Heads, David Bowie, the Clash  fan out around me, and an array of paperbacks sprawl among a weeks discarded clothes. I begin to read: Let us go then, you and I,/When the evening is spread out against the sky/Like a patient etherized upon a table  and, with a 17-year-olds sense of imminent upheaval, feel the stirrings of a new language in me, connected to my own language but having passed through fire. I cant say whether the voice the poem puts in my head as it extends its opening invitation is stiffly formal, smarmy or seductive.

He had never noticed it and decided to see where it led; after a short drive, he found himself amid a strange encampment. Withers stepped out of his truck and looked around. Cheerful, rickety houses sprouted from the ground like unclassified fungi, or something dreamed up by Lewis Carroll, but what appealed to him most was the barn; on the side, in large yellow letters, someone had written Welcome Home. Withers walked up to a shack that appeared to be inhabited and  overtaken by curiosity  he knocked. The woman who came out looked surprised. She told him that he was on a commune for gay, lesbian and transgender people and suggested politely that he leave. Later, Withers called his friend Neal Appelbaum, the openly gay director of the arts center in neighboring Cannon County, and told him about what he saw. Appelbaum explained that Withers had stumbled into Ida, a commune for queer vegetarians; the entire region was home to maybe a dozen rural planned communities for L.G.B.T.Q. people, a kind of sexually nonconforming Amish country. He also pointed out that the fading sign on the barn didnt say Welcome Home. The last letter was not an e but an o.",2015-08-06T11:00:18+0000

(Starz Edge) FROZEN (2013) Warm up your vocal cords: This Disney movie musical produced Let It Go, the Oscar-winning power anthem written by the married songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa, above (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. Allegorically, Frozen lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like Beauty and the Beast, but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen.",2015-08-07T05:00:03+0000

Womens legs are tangled in their own sex-segregated history of social control and gender politics; shorts are, first off, short pants, and it was not so very long ago that women were told wearing pants of any length was prima facie evidence of moral turpitude. The man in shorts, meanwhile, occupies a space that is more subtly strange. Year after year, as surely as tender spring yields to scalding summer, a season of dress-code controversies gives way to a running conversation about the unwritten rules of urban spaces, with arbiters of taste cringing at mens legs in shorts as if wincing at a comedy of embarrassment.",2015-08-07T11:00:04+0000

Box (whose initials stand for Charles James, dashing your hopes that his full name was Cracker Jack Box) is best known for his series of gritty mysteries about the Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett. But in Badlands, a stand-alone suspense thriller new at No.5 on the hardcover fiction list, Box shifts his attention to North Dakota and the fracking boom; the book, set in the fictional oil town of Grimstad, N.D., is about a 12-year-old boy who witnesses a car accident on his paper route and makes off with the bundle of drugs and money he finds at the scene. As a child, Box had relatives who worked blue-collar jobs in the energy industry  The house I grew up in didnt have a single bookcase except mine, he once told a website devoted to crime fiction  and in this novel he pokes some fun at journalists who reflexively condemn big oil. They fly all the way here from the East Coast burning up jet fuel, the town sheriff grouses at one point, then rent cars and fill em with gasoline to drive all the way to Grimstad just so they can trot me out to say, Oil is bad. I wont play their game anymore. Box has observed reporters up close: He used to be one. My first job was working for a small Wyoming weekly newspaper, he told the same website, The Rap Sheet, in 2010. In retrospect, it was spectacular training in the real world for what was to come.

While a full consideration of Williamss career would naturally gravitate toward his sympathetic serio-comic roles in films like Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, these performances overshadow other, more idiosyncratic but equally vivid efforts  some from a time when his on-screen persona hadnt completely coalesced, and others he was able to sneak in once his fame was assured.

(HBO) THE HOBBIT: THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES (2014) In Peter Jacksons conclusion to the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, above), the hobbit and his companions become mired in a war that threatens to destroy Middle-earth. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, who finds himself at the heart of the story after his imprisonment; Richard Armitage is Thorin Oakenshield, the headstrong leader with a lust for treasure; Evangeline Lilly is the elf Tauriel, who pursues a forbidden love; and Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the dragon Smaug.

In July, a full three months later, we received an email from our neighbor stating: Would you mind reminding your housekeeper that they have a large portion of my swimming towels, I was terribly short this weekend. Hope you had a great Fourth of July. This was the first we heard of missing towels. We did not want our housekeeper to think that we or our neighbor thought the children had taken towels that did not belong to them, so we made the decision to purchase 12 towels and give them to our neighbor. We wrapped them up and left them with a note  A little surprise for your generosity. A week later, we found the box of towels with a note back at our door  I cannot accept these towels and cannot keep them because it is morally as wrong for me to take your towels as it was for your housekeepers children to keep my towels. We do not think the children were morally wrong in intent; they simply did what kids do when getting out of the pool  dry off and then wrap in a towel before piling into cars to go home. Had we known about the towels, we would have collected them at the time, but three months after the fact changes how we think the towels should be regarded. The cost of the towels is not really an issue for us or our neighbors. Should we have tried to retrieve the towels from several families before buying new ones? We are almost certain that our housekeeper was not even aware the children were given towels, as she was at our house the entire swim time cleaning up from the meal. Our effort to replace the towels was meant to defuse the situation, not continue into a towel saga. NAME WITHHELD",2015-08-12T11:00:05+0000

A grand jury in Missouri did not indict the officer, Darren Wilson. Experts said that the use of grand juries in criminal cases already was relatively rare in California. But now prosecutors will no longer have the option of sending difficult cases to grand juries: they will have to decide whether to indict police officers. Because grand jury testimony is often held in secret, Holly Mitchell, the author of the law, said that the change would increase trust in police officers and transparency in government.

Like Baltimore in The Wire and New Orleans in Treme, Yonkers symbolizes the tortured metamorphosis of the post-industrial American city. And in Wasicsko, elected mayor at 28 and caught in a vortex of racism and fear, it would seem to have a classic tragic hero: an impetuous young man who grows into leadership, is cast out and doesnt live to see the full fruit of the seeds he planted.",2015-08-13T16:26:28+0000

The Environmental Protection Agency is still analyzing water farther along the spills path  in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation and Utah. Officials in Utah said waste from the mine had probably reached Lake Powell, a major water storage facility for the region. E.P.A. officials have said they will have to monitor the spills path for years to understand its full effect. The Gold King Mine, near Silverton, burst on Aug. 5 while workers contracted by the E.P.A. were conducting a field investigation of the mine, which had leaked for years. The agency has said it was responsible for the spill. Levels of metals including arsenic and lead jumped in local waterways as the contamination flowed down the Animas River and into the San Juan, angering many who use these rivers for drinking, irrigation and recreational activities. Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and the Navajo Nation declared states of emergency. The rivers remained closed Thursday. ",2015-08-14T00:10:07+0000

Scott called the film as dark and terrifying as any motion picture in recent memory, not excluding the bloody installments in the Saw franchise, adding, It is also something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme  I am tempted to say evil  genius. In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Mr. Burtons sugar-rush adaptation of the Roald Dahl book, at 8 p.m. on ABC Family, Mr. Depp portrays an oddly sinister candy maker, and Freddie Highmore is a boy who wants nothing more than to swim in chocolate. Well, who wouldnt? Despite burdening Willy Wonka with a psychological back story, there is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonkas world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. The real lesson of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is  or should be  that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards.",2015-08-14T05:00:05+0000

At first, place the toothbrush at a safe distance, somewhere out of reach but visible. Every day, inch it closer until you can hold the brush in your hand while you teach the gorilla to open its mouth. To do this, reward it with grapes, slices of apple, popcorn or juice (Crystal Light is an ape favorite). The first time an animal completes the desired behavior, jackpot it, offering 10 grapes instead of one.

Take Gomezs large-scale version of Hockneys iconic American Collectors double portrait, for example, which Gomezs Los Angeles dealer, Charlie James, exhibited at the most recent Expo Chicago. It looks almost exactly like the original portrait of the couple in question, clenched in a grim rictus amid the sculptures in their backyard garden, except that Gomez replaced the two collector protagonists with a pair of dark-skinned gardeners of the sort who regularly do the actual tending of such gardens. Into another Hockney, of one of those nondescript West Los Angeles apartment buildings with its wide front lawn, Gomez slotted a groundskeeper, rake extended. That was the genius of the whole series: how in much the same way that, back in the 60s, the English transplant Hockney first opened our eyes to so much that we had previously overlooked in Los Angeles, rendering all sorts of things visible to us as if for the first time (those boxy apartment buildings, the distinctive street signs, the moderne furniture, that light), so Gomez seemed to be allowing us, indeed forcing us, to notice the very groundskeepers and housemaids and pool cleaners who make that look, the look of Los Angeles, possible, rendering visible a whole world of people, our fellow humans, who often go unseen (and who, for that matter, because they are sometimes illegal, often strive not to be seen).",2015-08-14T11:00:19+0000

Fifteen years after the predawn raid by American agents that led to his return to his father in Cuba, he has announced that he would like to visit the United States again. With the thaw in relations between the two countries, the times are vastly different. But as we are expansively reminded in Make Your Home Among Strangers, Jennine Cap Crucets heartfelt first novel about a Cuban-American family entangled in a fictionalized account of the Gonzlez affair, no amount of change erases the past. With history onboard, Crucet shows us how journeys between cultures are almost impossible to navigate and family relationships are bound to dump us in choppy waters.",2015-08-14T14:50:55+0000
us,"The Popes Daughter, by Dario Fo","Last year, at the venerable age of 88, the Italian comic Dario Fo took on a new creative challenge. The veteran of more than 60 years as an actor, painter, director, stage designer and playwright (as well as the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature), he had in recent years begun to deliver delightful public lectures on artists  Giotto, Leonardo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Picasso  and architecture, including the Romanesque cathedral of Modena. But up to 2014, he had never written a novel. That changed with The Popes Daughter, now translated into English, although needless to say for this wild man of the theater, the word novel is not quite enough to encompass his lightly fictional labor of love for, of all people, Lucrezia Borgia. The Popes Daughter is also a picture book, illustrated with some of Fos own colorful paintings, most based on Renaissance originals. It has since become a full-blown theatrical script. (Meanwhile, Fo has finished a second illustrated novel, inspired by an 18th-century Danish prince, Christian VII.)",2015-08-14T14:52:55+0000

The writing tables curious height enabled Virginia to peer at the world from the same viewpoint as her artist sister, to witness all at once the world itself, the world transcribed in ink and the world brushed onto a canvas.

The harsh realities of daily life under Communism being what they are, disillusionment sets in quickly. Even so, the novels dreamy and impressionistic linked episodes, which take the narrator from his boyhood under Brezhnev to his adulthood, offer up this essential truth: Fleeting moments of beauty and love are to be treasured above all else. Carved out of even the most dreary and oppressive circumstances, theyre the sum of a life, a means of triumphing over brutality, a more powerful form of resistance than dissident whisperings.",2015-08-14T14:53:53+0000

Lilly, who before his death in 2001 did as much as anyone to promote the image of dolphins as a nearly alien superspecies that might speak English someday. In the 1960s, Lillys unfettered enthusiasm caught on big with a certain segment of the public, but his fellow scientists were less enthralled: As Casey notes, the trade reviews of his 1961 book, Man and Dolphin, were scathing. Scientifically unsound and nave, Natural History fumed, judging the book a perfect example of how not to do scientific research. The biologist E.O. Wilson called it borderline irresponsible, and a Navy researcher snarked: I find Dr. Lillys work very interesting. I like Dr. Seuss, too. Not that the reviews hurt the books prospects: Man and Dolphin hit the New York Times best-seller list at No.15. But Lillys reputation as a scientist never quite recovered. Lilly is so fascinating because hes so polarizing, Casey told Fresh Air this month. He was pretty freewheeling about the things he did and the things he said.

Felicity Jones, who earned a nomination, plays his first wife, Jane Hawking, whose memoir, Traveling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, is the main source for James Marshs portrait of a marriage.

O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this best picture nominee. But it is in showing the application of that intelligence that The Theory of Everything tumbles into a black hole of biopic banality.

Born in Alaska in 1936 to a father who was a mining engineer, Ms. Berlin lived all over the American West and in Chile, New York City and Mexico. She survived childhood abuse and adult alcoholism, an addiction that sent her, in her words, to jails, hospitals, psych wards. She hung out with poets and musicians (marrying two jazz players). By her early 30s, she had been divorced three times and had four sons. She worked as a house cleaner, a substitute teacher and a hospital clerk. She put much of her roving, rowdy life onto the page in vivid stories that garnered the respect of a modest audience and now could be on the verge of making her posthumously famous.",2015-08-16T21:39:12+0000

The editor sent back many changes, the most telling of which was that the quotation was now attributed to the English poet T.S. Eliot. Vaguely piqued, I asked what the editor was trying to clarify: Was he afraid readers wouldnt realize the quotation came from a poem? Or was he afraid readers might confuse the Eliot who wrote it with, say, George Eliot, the pseudonymous author of Middlemarch? Anyway, I noted that the English qualifier was misleading: Though T.S. Eliot had taken British citizenship, he had been born in America. The editor, then, sent on another suggestion: the American-born English poet T.S. Eliot. I, having lost all the patience I had as a 24-year-old, replied by modifying that tag to: the American-born, British-citizen English-language poet, essayist, dramatist, teacher, publisher and bank teller Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888-1965), after which the editor finally got the point and canceled the assignment.",2015-08-17T09:00:04+0000

A statement by the group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in The Hague, came a few days after United States officials said Islamic State militants appeared to have used such munitions, possibly mustard gas, on Kurdish fighters in Iraq. If confirmed, it would be the first known use of the weapons by the Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq. The monitoring group called such reports a matter of serious concern, and its director, Ahmet Uzumcu, said it would examine any substantive reports it receives including pertinent information that might be shared by other signers of the chemical weapons ban, which appeared to be a reference to both Iraq and Syria. Iraq, where hundreds of old, corroded mustard artillery shells remained after the 2003 American invasion, signed the chemical weapons ban in 2009. Syria joined in 2013 after having promised to destroy its chemical stockpile, although the monitoring organization said this year that chlorine bombs had been used in the Syrian conflict. On Aug. 7, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing an inquiry into who was responsible for the chlorine attacks. ",2015-08-17T23:39:20+0000

The idea was to send teams of social scientists, including anthropologists, to gather ethnographic, sociocultural and economic information and advise front-line soldiers on a range of delicate topics, from the mechanics of forging tribal alliances to how to respond to local offers of hospitality.",2015-08-18T18:47:55+0000

Now, for a restaurant project in a new hotel, Mr. Waxman is reviving Jams in spirit, though not in detail. It is an airy space done in stone and wood, and more rustic than the original, with simpler table settings and dishtowel napkins. Some of the 100 seats are at a long bar, and an open kitchen anchors the rear of the space. Along with grilled chicken with tarragon butter; and red pepper latkes with smoked salmon, corn and California caviar  which are holdovers from the 1980s  Jams will serve brightly accented dishes like rigatoni with crab meat and chile as well as swordfish with grilled pineapple salsa. Its my food, less Italian than Barbuto, but still what I like to cook, Mr. Waxman said. Barbuto is his West Village restaurant, and its pastry chef Heather Miller is making the desserts at Jams, too. Melvyn Master, the wine expert who was Mr. Waxmans partner and the m in the name (Jams stands for Jonathan and Melvyn) is providing some of his wines to the new restaurant: 1 Hotel Central Park, 1414 Avenue of the Americas (58th Street), 212-703-2007.",2015-08-18T20:05:11+0000

If you write a book about characters of this age, you get to document that fleeting moment of change from childhood to not-childhood, when the only person looking out for you might well be you. McCullerss brilliant 1946 novel The Member of the Wedding used a spiky, soulful 12-year-old girl, Frankie Addams, as a vessel for ideas about, among other things, aloneness  both the day-to-day kind and the mortality kind.

Turner (1775-1851), the man the Victorian critic John Ruskin called the greatest painter of all time. Mike Leighs biographical masterpiece juxtaposes the vexing genius of Turners later years and his ramshackle personal life. Turner the painter divined luminously stormy seascapes and placid river scenes that inspired the praise of critics and the envy of colleagues  until his work fell out of fashion. Turner the man lived with his father (Paul Jesson), copulated with his longtime housekeeper (Dorothy Atkinson) and ignored his daughters by his semi-estranged wife (Ruth Sheen) while keeping company with a kindhearted widow (Marion Bailey) whose last name he adopts. Mr. Turner is a mighty work of critical imagination, a loving, unsentimental portrait of a rare creative soul, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this Oscar nominee in cinematography, costume and production design, and original score. But even as it celebrates a glorious painter and illuminates the sources of his pictures with startling clarity and insight, the movie patiently and thoroughly demolishes more than a centurys worth of mythology about what art is and how artists work. He added, It might be risking Ruskinesque folly to take Mr. Turner as a self-portrait of its director, but Turner shares with Mr. Leigh an ability to travel the circuit between the sublime and the ordinary, to bring into view aspects of reality that had been somehow invisible in plain sight.",2015-08-20T04:15:02+0000

You can see evidence of this history: in the indigo bunting blue of Blue Panel I from 1977; in the pointed angles, like crests on northern cardinals, of Red-Orange Panel from 1980; and in the snowy span, like egret wings, of Memorial from 1993. Or at least you can start to see it once youve come to grips with other, more obvious features of Mr. Kellys art: its radical simplicity, its merger of painting and sculpture, its romance with architecture, its contribution to the history of modernism. But all of this absorbing takes time, the way bird watching does. ",2015-08-20T21:57:00+0000

You know the drill. A social problem is explored, a famous or obscure persons life story is told, a historical episode is illuminated, in a familiar rhythm and pace. Talking-head interviews alternate with archival clips or re-enactments, all in the service of an argument or a plot. Usually its all over in about 90 minutes, and you take away a neat little package of outrage, empathy or enlightenment. Even long-form documentaries, like The Jinx, Andrew Jareckis mini-series on the alleged crimes of Robert Durst, follow this formula, in that they depend on the quickening of the viewers attention.

While marketers call the often-normal decrease low T; the F.D.A. calls it age-related hypogonadism and describes it as controversial. In a commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials cited concerns over cardiovascular risks of testosterone treatment and suggested that the benefits claimed in ads are unsupported by substantial evidence. The supplements are approved by the F.D.A. for treating classic hypogonadism, which includes well-recognized medical conditions like testicular damage. But most men prescribed testosterone do not appear to have this condition, agency officials wrote, calling the trend troubling. To date, no randomized, controlled trials have been designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes in men taking supplemental testosterone. ",2015-08-21T02:34:22+0000

Since 2009, when the Obama administration first began trying to close the Guantnamo prison, the executive branch has studied the logistical capacity of several bases to handle such prisoners. President Obama wants to close Guantnamo Bay before he leaves office in January 2017. Of the 116 detainees remaining there, 52 are recommended for transfer if security conditions can be met in the receiving country. But even if all of those lower-level detainees can be resettled, the United States would be left with 64 prisoners who are not approved for release. ",2015-08-21T02:55:19+0000

Docents decode the work of Leonardo, Rembrandt and Turner; restorers use magnifying glasses, eyedroppers, scalpels and cotton swabs to repair a tiny chip in a painting; senior executives politely battle younger ones, who believe the museum is too stodgy; and connoisseurs discuss the underpinnings of masterpieces by Vermeer, Caravaggio, Titian, Velzquez, Pissarro and Rubens. Mr. Wiseman also makes the point that art is the story of human relationships  in labor, commerce, patronage and even the exploitation of bodies. Mr. Wisemans touch is deft but light here, and the experience of watching National Gallery is pleasurable and immersive because hes a wonderful storyteller, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this three-hour movie. It is also unexpectedly moving. Because his other great theme is how art speaks to us, one he brilliantly expresses in the relay of gazes that finds us looking at museumgoers looking at portraits that look right back  at artists, art lovers and moviegoers  even as Mr. Wiseman, that sly old master, looks at all of us in turn.",2015-08-21T05:00:03+0000

Since the principal obstacle to understanding a culture is, of course, the language that expresses it, language can loom large in these books; and a language divide is a concept difficult to express pictorially.

He happens to be the father of Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird), an obnoxious young star, and his older sister, Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), who was banished from the family after setting a fire that may have been intended to kill her brother, and which badly burned her. Eventually Agatha befriends a limo driver (Robert Pattinson) and turns an Internet acquaintanceship with Carrie Fisher into a job as Havanas personal assistant.

(Cinemax) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V.-positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication that is not then legal in the United States. He eventually begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicine for a monthly fee. Jared Leto, in another Oscar-winning performance, plays Rayon, a transgender woman who becomes Rons business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Valle and inspired by real events, is the sense that Rons efforts are part of a larger movement, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Rons bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaugheys disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers interest in the complexity of the character.

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965, he felt, his daughter Luci said, a great sense of victory on one side and a great sense of fear on the other. According to Ari Berman, a political correspondent for The Nation, he knew the law would transform American politics and democracy more than any other civil rights bill in the 20th century, but he also feared that it would deliver the South to the Republican Party for years to come. Both predictions proved to be accurate. The revolution of 1965 spawned an equally committed group of counterrevolutionaries, Berman writes in Give Us the Ballot. Since the V.R.A.s passage, they have waged a decades-long campaign to restrict voting rights. Berman argues that these counterrevolutionaries have in recent years, controlled a majority on the Supreme Court and have set their sights on undoing the accomplishments of the 1960s civil rights movement.",2015-08-25T09:00:06+0000

The club occupied a section of 47th Street, near the lake, that long served as the boundary between the aging mansions of Kenwood and the greater South Side beyond. Across the street was a record shop that sold house music and a drive-through liquor store that peddled home brew in gallon jugs with the promise Wont go flat! In a hot-dog stand on the block, two teenagers once pummeled me with their fists while three of my tennis buddies could only watch, as we were useless at hitting anything other than yellow balls. The original owners of the club soon bailed. The many racquetball courts they had built went mostly unused. The sauna wasnt properly ventilated and rotted the locker room. A fitness chain eventually rented the space, filling half the tennis courts with weight benches and treadmills; the other five courts remained playable but were invariably coated in tennis ball fuzz, many of their overhead lights askew and glaring or altogether dark.",2015-08-26T11:00:08+0000

Nearly all date from around 1968, a period when art radically diversified, sometimes dematerializing altogether. These works represent artists from distant regions whose efforts ran parallel in terms of strategies (largely Conceptual, frequently performance-oriented), political contexts (often oppressive) and interests (protest, mass media, popular art). Some names  Valie Export, Ana Mendieta, Edward Krasinski, Juan Downey, Fernando Botero  will be familiar; others will be much less so.

Abravanel, after all, recorded the first Mahler cycle by an American orchestra with the Utah Symphony Orchestra, as it called itself then, from 1963 to 1974 for the Vanguard label. (Leonard Bernsteins groundbreaking 1960s survey for Columbia, mostly with the New York Philharmonic, disqualified itself with an Eighth Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra.) You would hope that the new performances and recordings would automatically supersede the old ones, but this first disc does not necessarily bear that out. Abravanels 1974 First Symphony, as remembered, relies perhaps a bit too much on sheer nervous energy, but it is also more respectful of the subtleties of Mahlers score. ",2015-08-26T23:09:32+0000

If the Saudi government announced it, Im certainly not in any position to characterize it any other way, Mr. Kirby said. King Salman, who became king in January, pulled out of a summit meeting with Persian Gulf leaders at Camp David in May. The Saudis have been concerned about the Iran accord but endorsed it three weeks ago, along with other Gulf states, after receiving assurances from American officials. Prem G.

The effort has already met with a rebuke from Jewish groups like Bnai Brith, which said in a statement that raising a flag was a privilege accorded to a member state and that part of the Palestinian territories is under the control of Hamas, which is openly committed to the destruction of an existing U.N. member state, Israel.

When he returned to live downtown for an artist residency in 2006, his gaze was again drawn upward. I was amazed by the canyon of high-rises, he says, and the whole idea of the newcomer looking up. It was with this view in mind that he embarked on an ongoing series, City of Ghosts, which combines street and architectural photography. Soinio captures the beauty of the citys renowned landmarks  the Washington Square Arch, the Flatiron and Woolworth buildings  and pulls them into the foreground, while unwitting passersby become shadowy, anonymous characters in a duet between pedestrian and monument. Shooting with a 4x5-inch camera with no viewfinder, the defocused scene is both familiar and utterly foreign, as Soinio puts it, thanks to his manipulation of the images depths of field. In the happy accident of photography, if you really know your camera, you can do so much, he says. As City of Ghosts has continued, Soinio has shifted his attention to the changing urban landscape and the new glass towers that now reach skyward.

They must protect the last real human city, Zion, while battling the machines and the evil Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of surprise (even when the films most important Oracle turns out to be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her refrigerator), The Matrix makes particular virtues out of eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest selling point, Janet Maslin wrote in The Times.

Murray Abraham) tells an author (Jude Law) the story of how he came to own the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film flashes back to 1932, detailing the friendship between the young Zero (Tony Revolori, center, with Tom Wilkinson, left, and and Owen Wilson) and the hotel concierge, Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is framed for the murder of an aristocrat (Tilda Swinton) and flees with Zero. They are pursued by her family and henchmen (Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe) while trying to protect a prized painting. Zero, meanwhile, deals with romance. There is no doubt that Mr. Anderson possesses a distinctive sensibility and a consistent visual style, and that instead of striking out in new directions, he tends to embroider and elaborate on familiar themes and pictorial habits, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. You will see many of them here: static, densely packed, fussily composed frames; traveling shots in which the camera glides alongside the characters like a low-flying bird; action sequences that refuse the usual digital hocus-pocus in favor of the older, artisanal magic of stop-motion animation, matte paintings and rear projection.
