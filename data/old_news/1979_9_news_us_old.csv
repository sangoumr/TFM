That is why the Administration's discovery there of a Soviet combat force of 2,000 or 3,000 men is a disturbance in SovietAmerican relations far exceeding the military threat of one brigade. If the flashpoints of the cold war are not now out of bounds to new efforts to upset the military balance, no policy of general reconciliation with Moscow can long survive in the American political arena.

us,"Screen: 'Vipers, 'Venice and Facism:Romance of Decadence","""NEST of Vipers,"" which opens today at the Translux East Theater, is the English title of Tonino Cervi's ""Ritratto di Borghesia in Nero,"" an Italian romantic melodrama that attempts (but fails) to take a dim view of the kind of upper-class decadence that helped (it says here) make possible the rise of Mussolini and Italian Fascism in the 1930's.Like Bernardo Bertolucci and Luchino Visconti at their very worst. Mr. Cervi is too fascinated by the picturesque details of decadence to be very convincing as a moralist. He's more like a gossipmonger and ""Nest of Vipers"" is a solemn-faced joke, played by a lot of people who are better than their material. The setting is Venice, a city that should be protected from overwrought movie directors as well as from the sea.The film, which is based on a story by Roger Peyrefitte, is about the worldly, beautiful Carla and the equally worldly, beautiful Renato, who behave less like the mother and teen-age son they are than like sister and brother. Renato calls her Carla and, though he's madly in love with her, he doesn't hesitate to act as Pandarus when someone strikes his mother's fancy. Carla and Renato are poor but well-born. They make do with the casual arrogance of true aristocrats.At the beginning of ""Nest of Vipers"" we meet their newest victim, a handsome young music student from the provinces, a highly moral, strait-laced fellow named Mattio. For a while it's touch and go whether Mattio will be seduced by Carla or Renato, or maybe by both at the same time. Carla wins the race by a beautiful nose and then goes on to fall deeply in love with Mattio, much to Renato's fury. But then Mattio, in his turn, falls deeply in love with the beautiful, worldly but far younger and much richer Elena.It's the sort of situation that bodes danger for all, and one that is finally resolved when one character picks up a bronze statuette and bashes another character over the head. I don't know about you but I've long since learned not to take seriously any movie in which someone hits someone else over the head with a bronze statuette, if only because of their rarity in the households I frequent.Everyone in ""Nest of Vipers"" lives in a palazzo or a part of a palazzo and because it's Venice, it's impossible for anyone to go anywhere, even, I suppose, to buy toothpaste, without walking in front of a vista that screams, ""Having wonderful time. Wish you were here.""In movies like this, of course, no one ever buys toothpaste. They're too busy falling in and out of love, being seduced and abandoned and eating well, to pay much attention to such ordinary functions as daily dental prophylaxis.Mr. Cervi obviously means this story of ravaged innocence to have some relation to the political and social life of Italy in the early 30's. We see uniformed Fascists speaking from balconies in the distance and sometimes close up as bit players dropping names (Mussolini, Mussolini's mistress), but his system is too simple to be of much interest. When Mattio succumbs to the evil in this world, it doesn't seem inevitable but more like an accident of nature, something on the order of swamp fever.The performers, though, are attractive and forthright, especially Senta Berger, who looks like Rita Hayworth in her prime, as the wicked but eventually victimized Carla, and Ornella Muti (""The Last Woman"") as the sweet-faced rich girl who lures Mattio away from Carla. Christian Borromeo is very good as the once-innocent Mattio and Capucine, still rail-thin and elegant, is nice to see as Miss Muti's far-from-foolish mother.Nobody at Paramount Pictures, which is distributing this film, seems to know the names of the actors who play Renato and Miss Muti's father. Both actors are fine enough to be acknowledged, and the roles too important to be dismissed in this fashion.",1979-09-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: 'Patrick' From Australia:A Seventh Sense,"""PATRICK,"" the Australian shock-melodrama that opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is about a short-tempered fellow whose mother insists on making noisy love to a man not her husband in the room next to Patrick's. Later, while the pair is having a soothing soak in the tub, Patrick shocks them fatally by dropping an electric heater into the water. In what we are told is the explosion that follows, Patrick suffers brain damage and is considered dead except for the fact that his heart continues to beat.All of this happens behind the opening credits of ""Patrick,"" which is the story of Patrick's revenge on the living as he lies in a comatose state in a private clinic, a none-too-reassuring establishment run by a certain Dr. Roget (Robert Helpmann), who looks 2,000 years old and hasn't a line in his face. Patrick, in his isolation from his other senses, has developed what is called ""a seventh sense."" He can read other people's minds and move objects, often at a great distance and sometimes with lethal effect.The film, which was directed by Richard Franklin and is called ""a Richard Franklin film,"" much as ""Prophecy"" was called ""a John Frank-enheimer film,"" is absurd but not without its comic moments, which ""Prophecy"" lacked. There's a cold, emotionally unreliable chief nurse, nicely played by Julia Blake, who says such things as ""Disease, like God, moves in mysterious ways,"" and, of a new nurse, ""She comes to us in the wake of an unstable marriage situation.""You can't be mad at a movie with lines like that, or with one that casts Susan Penhaligon as its worried heroine, a nurse for whom Patrick develops an unhealthy passion. Miss Penhaligon has the round-faced prettiness of a silent-film star and the sexy, self-assured humor of French actresses like Bulle Ogier and Miou-Miou. It's a terrific combination.The special effects aren't at all bad, but the only shock in the movie comes when the mad doctor sticks a long needle into the brain of a real-life frog. Somehow that doesn't seem entirely cricket.With the exception of Miss Penhaligon and Miss Blake, the other actors in the movie, including Robert Thompson, who plays Patrick, seem ill-atease, badly directed or just rotten.""Patrick,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some details of bogus medical procedures that might prove usetting to the weak of stomach.",1979-09-07T05:00:00+0000

The 500page manuscript consisted of work that the 23 considered their best writings and that they had never been able to get past the censors.

Mr. Wilde, Mr. Hale, Mr. Ferrer and Lloyd Bridges play the aged Musketeers who set history straight. Rex Harrison plays Jean Baptiste Colbert, Louis's remarkably able chief minister, as a wily but immensely benign old fellow, and Mr. McShane is the evil Nicolas Fouquet, whose enduring monument is the magnificent chateau, Vaux-le-Vicomte. In life he died in prison. In the movie he disappears into a sewer.Miss Andress, as Louis's mistress, pops prettily out of dresses that make her look like a self-propelled vanity table, while Miss Kristel (""Emmanuelle,"" ""The Concorde  Airport '79"") is sweet without being stupid as the Spanish Infanta, Louis's fiance.Though ""The Fifth Musketeer"" is loaded with intrigue, duels, large-scale swordplay, heavy costumes and heavier dcor, it is singularly without style or even excitement. In the center of it, Mr. Bridges the younger seems bewildered in the manner of someone unsure of his real identity.""The Fifth Musketeer,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains duels in which one person or another inevitably gets stuck, but the blood is kept to a minimum.",1979-09-08T05:00:00+0000

us,It's a Bird! A Plane? Superman?,"GLENDALE, N.Y.  As the search for energyefficient forms of transportation continues, it's time to reassess a type of longdistance transport that held great promise until a world war, cheap oil and other factors caused its death over 40 years ago. It's time to bring back the zeppelin. The zeppelin, or rigid airship as it's technically known, is the perfect cargo carrier for these oilscarce times. Unlike airplanes, which must fight against gravity and wind resistance to remain aloft, an airship is designed to work with the environment. Instead of burning precious jet fuel in a vain attempt to battle nature, a zeppelin, using lighterthanair helium, floats gently in the needing only a few modest propellers to power its journey. However, since trucks, not airplanes, carry most of the nation's goods, zeppelins would have to be competitive with interstate trucking to be a real transportation alternative. To this end, even by using 30yearold technology, we could construct a line of 1,300footlong zeppelins capable of carrying over 500 tons of cargo between New York and Los Angeles in 36 hours. That's at least two to three days faster than by truck. While they were shaving days from shipping time, such zeppelins would also save fuel. For instance, the four 1,800horsepower engines that would be needed to propel a large airship would consume at least 35 percent less diesel fuel than the equivalent number of trucks that would be necessary to transport the same goods. But airships don't have to compete against trucks; they can work with them. Just as container ships have replaced traditional ocean freighters, zeppelins could be built to carry containerized cargo across the land. Trucks could then be used, as they are bestsuited, for the short trips between airports, distribution markets and local merchants. In the past, the major drawback to building a zeppelin fleet was the initial design and construction costs. Until the recent oilprice increases, the amount of fuel that airplanes and trucks wasted was inconsequential when compared to the cost of building zeppelins. It was for this reason that in the late 1940's Goodyear scrapped its plans for a freight and passenger airship line. Now, however, with oil many times its 1940's price, an airship's fuel savings would more than set its construction costs. Besides cost, the only other hindrance to a renewed zeppelin program is zepplins allegedly poor safety record. But when one considers how safe airplanes were in the 1930's (when zeppelins last flew), one can see that this is really a nonargument. At rate, the public's perception of the zeppelin as a flammable deathtrap is based on the fact that the old zeppelins carried hydrogen to provide lift. Today, nonflammable helium will give almost the same lift potential, without hydrogen's inherent danger. Another advantage modern zeppelins would have over their ancestors is advanced navigational and safety equip",1979-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Love and Bullets' Stars Charles Bronson:Bringing Home the Moll,"""WITH this scum, you gotta take the law into your own hands. You don't just book these guys, you kill 'em."" That's a line of dialogue from ""Love and Bullets,"" the new Charles Bronson movie, and it bears the unmistakable paw print of Wendell Mayes, who also wrote ""Death Wish."" However, this time there's a twist: Mr. Bronson doesn't speak that line, nor does he even endorse its sentiments very strongly.Mr. Bronson plays a police detective who's sent from Arizona to Switzerland to bring back a gangster's moll. And since the moll is played by Jill Ireland, who is Mrs. Bronson, a bit of moderation is called for. So Mr. Bronson does not even begin blowing people up, or puncturing them with a homemade blowgun, until the movie is nearly over. Instead, he spends most of his time escorting Miss Ireland onto trains, into hotels and across the snow.This is all very chivalrous, but it's also dull. The British-born Miss Ireland has no luck in affecting a hillbilly accent, and as a comic presence she's simply not there. However, she and Mr. Bronson approach each other with an appealing ease, which would be more appealing if it were not the movie's only selling point. Mr. Bronson grows ever more coolly dependable with each new film, but ""Love and Bullets"" is too clumsy to show him off to much advantage.Stuart Rosenberg, who directed ""The Amityville Horror"" as well as ""Love and Bullets,"" is one of the great wonders of the movie world. Mr. Rosenberg has had a long and successful career, and yet he still pays little heed to the most basic tricks of the trade, like establishing clear time sequences or letting the viewer know on which continent the action is taking place or even keeping his actors' faces out of the shadows. The Swiss scenery for ""Love and Bullets"" involves a lot of bright, snowy outdoor shots in which Mr. Bronson and Miss Ireland virtually disappear.Another of Mr. Rosenberg's trademarks is his way of keeping his extras just busy enough to distract attention from the principals. You may not be sure where Mr. Bronson and Miss Ireland are going on any particular leg of their journey, but you can't help noticing who else is on the train.""Love and Bullets,"" which opens today at the Rivoli, also features Rod Steiger as a godfather with a very large mansion and a stammer. His performance, which could seem restrained only in comparison with his ""Amityville Horror"" turn, would have been quite overwrought enough without the speech defect.""Love and Bullets"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Screen: Truffaut's 'The Green Room':High Priest of Death,"WHEN we first meet Julien Davenne (Franois Truffaut) in Mr. Truffaut's rigorous new film, ""The Green Room,"" Davenne comes as grief's practitioner, not to comfort a friend whose wife has died but to introduce him to the land of the dead.Julien understands his friend's loss and his fury when the priest attempts to console him with clichs about original sin, about death's being the daughter of that sin, and about resurrection. When the friend goes berserk with grief, Julien turns on the priest with contempt. ""We don't need platitudes,"" he says in effect. ""We want you to say, 'Stand up and walk.'""Julien knows what he's talking about. His own wife, Julie, died 10 years before, just after they were married at the end of World War I. As he survived the war without a scratch and is obsessed by the memory of fallen comrades, Julien to all outward appearances has survived the loss of Julie but he now devotes himself to her memory. He keeps a room in his house as a shrine to her. He surrounds himself with reminders of the dead and wounded. His housekeeper is ancient, not too far from the great divide. Her adopted son, a little boy named Georges, cannot speak.Julien works for a provincial weekly newspaper, whose subscribers are dying off and which is so far out of things that most people think it has already ceased publishing. Julien's specialty is, obviously, writing obituaries. Julien's love for Julie  so fixed that it denies any possibility of change  is itself a kind of antilove. It's not hatred, certainly, but it's dead.With the scary illogic of the fanatic, Julien says, ""The dead belong to us, as soon as we agree to belong to them.""Among other things, ""The Green Room,"" which opens today at the Sutton Theater, reminds us of the profound darkness that seems to exist just beyond the lighted area of all Truffaut films  the comedies such as ""Stolen Kisses"" and ""Day for Night"" as well as ""Jules and Jim"" and ""The Wild Child.""Like ""The Story of Adle H.,"" which is also about an obsession, ""The Green Room"" is a very romantic movie but less sentimental than a timetable. Quite consciously Mr. Truffaut keeps us one step removed from the grief of Julien Davenne so that, though we appreciate and believe it, we never identify with it and are never moved to conventional pity. We are forever separated from the pain on the screen, much as we are removed from the face of Julien that we see in one especially extraordinary shot  the features distorted by the rippled glass of a door. It's the face of one of those tormented Edvard Munch creatures, just after the scream of terror.Julien's obsession, which begins with the loss of his wife, eventually branches out to include all of the dead who were once important to him. As long as they are remembered they remain alive, he says. To this end he endows and maintains a chapel, filled with candles (""a forest of flame"") to the memory not only Julie but of childhood companions, of people like Oscar Wilde, Henry James and all sorts of others, including an unnamed German soldier whose photograph is that of Oscar Werner, the Jules of ""Jules and Jim.""His companion in this mission is a pretty young woman named Cecilia (Nathalie Baye), who has also suffered a great personal loss. Cecilia, however, refuses to play ""the dead against the living,"" as Julien does, and thus acknowledges her love for Julien. This is, of course, impossible for a priest of death to recognize.Like ""The Altar of the Dead,"" the Henry James short story on which Mr. Truffaut and Jean Gruault have partly based their screenplay, ""The Green Room"" is sometimes as maddeningly vague and ambiguous in its details as it is resolutely detached from its own feelings.There is an important plot revelation about halfway through the film, which supposedly explains why Davenne has withdrawn from life (it has to do with the unexplained duplicity of a best friend), but if this is true, it seems to betray the enormity of the grief we have been given to understand Davenne felt at the loss of his wife.The movie is extremely beautiful to look at, and the colors reflect the mind of Davenne, much as the slow, lingering dissolves do. But there are shocks, too. In that opening sequence in which Davenne goes to his newly bereaved friend, something most peculiar seems to be afoot when we at last see the body of the wife in the coffin. She has the pouty, dimpled, dyed-blond prettiness of a victim in a 1940's Dracula movie.Mr. Truffaut does not make it easy for us to respond to Davenne, as when Davenne amuses the boy with slides showing the dismembered and decapitated victims of the war. ""I claim the right not to forget,"" Davenne says at one point, and his claim overrides the claims of everyone else.There is also the unsettling (in this case) spectacle of the director being his own star, focusing his camera more tightly and more demandingly on his own face than ever did Chaplin, Keaton and Welles. The Truffaut face is actually most expressive at its most inert, but is he so detatched that he can see in it what we do? I'm not sure.Miss Baye is a lovely, very substantial woman, and her presense gives ""The Green Room"" an anchor in reality, as does the photography of Nestor Almendros. It's a movie full of rusts and deep greens, the shades of autumn and winter, of a feeling of dampness and cold drafts in rooms that are probably overheated.""The Green Room"" is not a movie you'll easily forget. It is a most demanding, original work and one must meet it on its own terms, without expectations of casual pleasures.""The Green Room,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), is about a subject that is probably beyond the reach of most children but contains nothing in the way of sex, violence or vulgar language that would otherwise merit the PG rating.",1979-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Run After Me':Jokes About Dogs,"YOU needn't actually have watched ""Run After Me  Until I Catch You!"" to feel that somehow, somewhere, you've seen this movie before. A lonely, middle-aged woman meets a lonely, middle-aged man, and after some initial fumbling, love blooms: so far, so familiar. Then they fight: familiar too. Finally, they take a country vacation and go bicycling past the wildflowers and jogging across the bosky terrain. If you haven't seen this sort of interlude elsewhere, you simply haven't been to the movies in years. This isn't the picture to bring you back again, either.There's nothing unpleasant about ""Run After Me  Until I Catch You!"" which opens at the Eastside Cinema today. But there's nothing unexpectedly appealing about it, either. Annie Girardot and Jean-Pierre Marielle are suitably likable as the lovers, and each has been given the obligatory cute quirk. He's a tax inspector, so he has an office full of funny citizens trying to cheat the French Government in funny ways. She grooms pets, so she works in a shop full of funny dogs. The shop is run by Marilu Tolo, whose appearance is brief but eye catching, partly because she's gorgeous and partly because of her surroundings. You'd look good next to a wet poodle, too.Mr. Marielle, who also has a fussy house-husband manner and a loutish son, bumbles sweetly. Miss Girardot is sterner, but eventually she reveals a generous, yielding nature and brings Mr. Marielle breakfast in bed. Both players have an easier time being amorous than being funny, perhaps because many of the film's comic situations have the strenuously wacky feeling of television humor.There is the time when Mr. Marielle is locked into his office and finally climbs out through a ceiling duct, while Miss Girardot thinks he has forgotten they had a date, for instance. Or the time one of his tax dodgers tries to make up a debt with two tons of cabbage. There's even the time Miss Girardot is left with five extra dogs at the end of a day and brings them to Mr. Marielle's house for dinner. Throughout the story, dog jokes abound.",1979-09-14T05:00:00+0000

These include the fire chief (Henry Fonda) and the members of his department; the chief surgeon (Barry Newman) of a new hospital and the rich playgirl (Susan Clark), who gave the hospital $3 million; a boozing television personality (Ava Gardner), who has to describe the holocaust to network viewers; the mayor (Leslie Nielsen), who allowed the refinery to be built inside the city limits; a fat, plucky chief nurse (Shelley Winters), and a determinedly cheerful, pregnant woman who is in labor throughout the entire crisis.The movie is supposed to be set in Anywhere, U.S.A., but was actually shot in Montreal. Some of the special effects are good; some are dreadful and some are in between.There are a limited number of variations that can be worked on the spectacle of people and buildings going up in flames. Only one of the film's so-called stars is fatally injured, but there are lots of unpleasant shots of other people  bit players  as they are being roasted alive or shortly after they're done.The Japanese do this sort of disaster movie much, much better.",1979-09-14T05:00:00+0000

This continuing suppression of evolution, through voluntary restraint by authors and publishers in the face of the strong feelings of a religious minority, hints that the phenomenon is deepseated.

us,Movie: 'Yanks' and British Girls,"TOWARD the middle of ""Yanks,"" John Schlesinger's mostly genteel romantic drama about the impact of United States servicemen on English life in World War II, there occurs a brawl between white and black American soldiers during a boozy New Year's Eve party at a Yorkshire dancehall. Though it is agonizing, the confrontation is rather clumsily set up. Long before anything happens, the camera points out the instigator, a brutish white soldier, who, furious at seeing a black soldier jitterbugging with a white English girl, moves through his crowd of friends, pouring hatred into their ears with all the subtlety of the player-uncle as he poisons Hamlet's dad.Near the end of the film we catch another brief glimpse of this same soldier shooting craps with his buddies in a field as their camp is being struck, preparatory to the journey that will lead to the beaches of Normandy. The scene is one of chaos. Trucks are coming and going. Soldiers stand around all packed but with no place to go yet. The local kids crowd around the barbed wire for the treats the departing soldiers toss them.Suddenly the bigot, who was the winner in the crap game, spots one especially appealing face, that of a solemn little boy who'd never dare ask for a second helping. The soldier goes over to the child, says brusquely, ""Hold out your hands,"" and presents the child with his fortune in coins. For the little boy it's Christmas in May.It's a beautifully realized, contradictory moment that evokes all sorts of feelings about war and peace, about the nature of bigotry, about behavior in alien lands, about childhood  the kinds of things that ""Yanks"" could use a lot more of. This big, expensive, meticulously detailed production otherwise has the look of someone who's fat without being well fed. It's soft, sort of spongy and so bland that you may well remember the scenery better than anything that happens in front of it.This, I suspect, is a risk that Mr. Schlesinger and his screen writers, Colin Welland and Walter Bernstein, took quite consciously when they decided to make a war movie without a war. ""Yanks"" is not about battles but about the effects of war on people far from the front, making do as best they can under circumstances that are demanding in direct relation to boredom, homesickness, loneliness and inconvenience. No guns are fired. The only violence is psychological.The focus of ""Yanks,"" which opens today at the Cinema One, is divided among three couples  an attractive, intelligent, married, high-born English woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and the American officer (William Devane) with whom she has a gentle affair; a virginal English girl (Lisa Eichhorn), daughter of the local postmaster, and the nice American mess sergeant (Richard Gere) with whom she falls in love, and a pert, funny, wise-cracking bus conductor (Wendy Morgan) and her lover, an Army cook and part-time prizefighter (Chick Vennera). They are all decent people and so relentlessly without idiosyncrasy that they hardly even quality as types.With the exception of Miss Redgrave, who can find humor and common sense in parts that virtually don't exist, the other leading actors are no more interesting than their material. Mr. Vennera and Miss Morgan are fairly lively in roles that I associate with the kind of old-fashioned musical in which the best friends of the hero and heroine have all the funny lines. Miss Eichhorn, an American actress, plays the English girl most persuasively, but she's so sweet that after a time one feels like ditching her. Mr. Gere underplays his role as if the movie were going to take up the slack and give his physical presense some sort of emotional impact. It doesn't.As is often the case with such films, the supporting actors have a better time of it, getting on and off the screen quickly with material that is more vivid for being compressed. Rachel Roberts and Tony Melody are totally honest and at ease as Miss Eichhorn's lower-middle-class parents, and Martin Smith is excellent as Miss Eichhorn's little brother, the fellow who, at the end, finds himself an apparently rich man.""Yanks"" isn't crass or vulgar, though at times you might wish it were. Such good taste is an invitation to snooze. In small things, though, the movie looks and sounds absolutely authentic, as in the mutual embarrassment felt by everyone when a well-meaning G.I. comes to call on an English family and overdoes the generosity with presents for everyone.""Yanks"" never succeeds, however, in making these three stories urgent or especially moving. The lovers and their various crises never rise above the perfunctory. As if aware of this, Mr. Schlesinger attempts to speed things up by using the soundtrack as a kind of teaser for things to come. While we're watching one scene, we hear dialogue and sound effects from the next scene, sometimes so far in advance of the cut you may think something has gone very wrong in the projection booth. It hasn't. What's wrong went wrong when the movie was being edited and, even before that, when it was written.",1979-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Wambaugh's 'The Onion Field',"THE story told in Joseph Wambaugh's ""The Onion Field"" is true: that was the book's biggest asset, and it's the movie's biggest problem. The crime at the heart of the tale is the 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles policemen  and the murder of one of the them  by a bizarrely matched pair of hoods, whose subsequent trials and retrials made this the longest court case in California's history. Meanwhile, the events took a terrible toll on the surviving officer, whose guilt about the incident led to nightmares, impotence, weight loss, height loss (he shrank by a full inch), kleptomania and a tendency toward suicide.This is a strong, affecting story but it's also a straggly one, populated by tangential figures and parallel plotlines; the criminals' histories are every bit as convoluted and fascinating as those of the policemen they abducted. Even the courtroom drama is unusually complicated, introducing a new legal team with each new trial. In writing his book about this, Mr. Wambaugh had time and energy to explore each new twist. But the format of a movie demands something more concise.Harold Becker, who directed ""The Onion Field,"" and Mr. Wambaugh, who wrote the script and reportedly supervised the production closely, have worked so hard to preserve the story's complexity that they've left it fragmented. The film is generally crisp and at times exciting, but it's also full of incidents that are only sketchily explained, and minus the all-important narrative thread that might have provided a clear point of view. Not even the surviving policeman, Karl Hettinger (John Savage), emerges as focus for the audience's sympathies. If anything, Hettinger is made to seem uncommonly remote.After Hettinger witnesses his partner's murder and is very nearly killed himself, he virtually disappears from the movie for a while; there's no scene that really gives him a chance to describe or illustrate how he feels. This is accurate enough, insofar as Hettinger appears to have been an unusually taciturn character, with a young wife cut from the same cloth. One of the more astonishing touches in Mr. Wambaugh's book, not used in the movie, is an account of 22-year-old Mrs. Hettinger giving birth to her first child, alone and at home, while her husband was busy testifying against his assailants.So perhaps it would have been inaccurate to show the stoical Hettinger confiding in his wife, or in anyone else. But it's a miscalculation, at least in dramatic terms, to keep him at arm's length from the audience. Mr. Savage is seen waking from bad dreams, looking upset, even holding a gun to his head in one scene. He does it all well, but he never seems to be doing enough, and the fault seems not to be his own. A crucial scene, in which Hettinger confronts his kidnapers for the first time, has the officer running out of the room before his reaction even registers. A moment that must have been important  the moment when Hettinger first gave an account of what had happened, once he was out of harm's way  is omitted altogether.The high point of ""The Onion Field,"" which opens today at the Beekman and other theaters, is the crime itself, which is terrifyingly re-enacted midway through the movie. Before that, much of the story is given over to a long, tawdry account of how the two criminals met and how the charismatic psychopath Greg Powell (James Woods) developed his hold over the weak, gullible Jimmy Smith (Franklyn Scales), who had been out of prison only days before committing this new crime. Once again, the movie offers more information than it needs to, and the results are confusing  especially since Mr. Becker's direction is so very lurid at this stage, as if to make sure the villains don't ingratiate themselves with the audience. Mr. Woods is much too ghoulish for there to be any danger of that.But after their capture, Mr. Seales and especially Mr. Woods become less exaggerated and more frighteningly plausible. Mr. Woods has some superb exchanges with Ronny Cox, who gives a fine performance as the detective in charge of interrogating the pair. This latter part of the movie is by far the most successful, perhaps because the courtroom scenes at last require the characters to explain themselves. For all the movie's crispness and authenticity, the clarity is long overdue.",1979-09-19T05:00:00+0000

In fact, in October, you'll be able to dig up what pleases you in the field and take it home, for a little more than a dollar a pot. So the opening this weekend is a kind of appetizer.

There's nothing as dead as an unrealized gag, except, perhaps, the single surviving sock of what once was a pair.The movie, which opens today at the Forum and other theaters, is apparently something that was originally put together by Michael O'Donoghue for television and then found to be too gamy for the tube. It may also be that the television people didn't find it all that hilarious. It's about 20 years too late to spoof ""Mondo Cane"" and its terrible spin-offs, though that's the format of this film. Among the sketches are one about a swimming school for cats in Amsterdam and one about a celebrity with webbed toes. There are some promisingly dopey man-in-the-street interviews (""Do you believe in capital punishment for elephants?"") and lots of rude things such as a sequence showing the late Sid Vicious singing ""My Way"" and a repeated shot of groceries outside an apartment identified as Gig Young's.The best and only really funny thing in the movie is a marvelous sketch about movie-making called ""Armageddon,"" contributed by Ernie Fosselius, who made the short but witty parody of ""Star Wars"" called ""Hardware Wars.""In addition to Mr. O'Donoghue, the director-producer as well as the star, the actors (all of whom are seen fleetingly) include Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin, Carrie Fisher, Mrs. Richard Nixon (in a newsreel clip) and other people too obscure to mention.",1979-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Heartland,' Unsentimental Pioneers:Puerto Rican Dancers Schedule Oct. 11-14 Season","There are two very different ways of recalling the lives of the pioneers who settled America's frontiers and carried civilization westward. One way is to remember the terrible physical hardships that had their equivalents in the settlers' psychological dislocations and disorders. These were the things that Boynton Merrill Jr. recorded in his remarkable book ""Jefferson's Nephews,"" about the decline and fall into poverty and madness of the members of one branch of the Lewis family when, in the early 19th century, they moved from Virginia into the Kentucky wilderness.By far the more popular method is to recall the pluck and perseverance that overcame all obstacles and made America great. There's nothing wrong with this method, though it does tend to be sentimental, prompting us to grieve for an innocence that probably never was. It also gives rise to the sort of myth about ""the American character"" that Dr. Norman Vincent Peale celebrates five nights a week in a 90-second syndicated radio show (WOR-AM) sponsored by International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. If I understand Dr. Peale correctly, the young men who save strangers from burning automobiles and the housewives who know how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at the supermarket are the direct descendants of Virginia Dare.The nicest thing about ""Heartland,"" a new, low-budget, uncommonly beautiful film written by Beth Ferris and directed by Richard Pearce, is that even though it celebrates the people of the American frontier, with emphasis on the women, it largely avoids sentimentality. The screenplay, based on the real-life story of Elinore Randall Stewart, is about an impoverished Denver widow who, in 1910, moves from the comparative ease of the city to the wilds of Burntfork, Wyo., to become the housekeeper for a taciturn Scottish rancher named Stewart. With her small daughter from her first marriage, and with Stewart, whom she eventually married, Mrs. Stewart survived just about everything the frontier could throw at her, including the death of a newly born baby and the loss of most of the ranch's livestock, as well as the sort of weather in which someone might freeze running from the house to the barn.The movie will be shown today at 9 P.M. at the Paramount Theater as part of the Festival of American Independent Films, being held in conjunction with the forthcoming New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. It will be shown again at the Paramount tomorrow at 3.Though Mr. Pearce has made documentaries and features for television and was the cameraman for Peter Davis's Oscar-winning ""Hearts and Minds,"" this is his first theatrical feature as a director. It is also Miss Ferris's first theatrical screen credit as a writer. Together they have made an unusually accomplished work.""Heartland,"" which was shot entirely in Montana under what must have been difficult circumstances, also has the benefit of three remarkable performances  by Rip Torn, as the dour rancher, a man whose humor, though buried, is as real as his courage; by Conchata Ferrell, as the no-nonsense housekeeper, a big, hearty woman who is strong without being tough, and by young Megan Folsom, as her small daughter, who looks a bit the way Peggy Ann Garner did in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."" Barry Primus is also very good as the ranch's hired hand, and Lilia Skala brings a kind of highly theatrical energy to her role as the local midwife. I just wish she hadn't plucked her eyebrows.Because the seasons are as important as anything that happens in them, the photography by Fred Murphy is very much a part of the film's success. The movie seems to have been shot mostly in the drained colors that Alan Pakula wanted for his ""Comes A Horseman,"" though what we saw on the screen was often so dark we couldn't tell what was going on. Mr. Murphy seems to have achieved his effects with high color contrasts that are never too bright and that have the texture of early black-and-white photography.""Heartland"" doesn't entirely avoid the clichs of the genre. It may be time to declare a moratorium on the slaughter of pigs on camera to indicate the fundamental laws that rule the farm. Also, there must be ways to celebrate the so-called miracle of life without forcing us to endure both human and animal births. After a point, they all look alike.Most of the time, though, ""Heartland"" is firm and realistic in its appreciation of its people and the quality of their lives. One feels they are so stubbornly independent that they would have little patience with prefabricated pep talks about the American character. In Mr. Torn and Miss Ferrell the film also has two actors who look and behave as if they were quite capable of coping with nature's worst and smiling about it afterward.",1979-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Robert M. Young's 'Alambrista!':The Cast,"Robert M. Young's ""Alambrista!"" (""The Illegal"") is a small, gentle, beautifully made film about a subject that might, in more conventional hands, have received either harsher or more histrionic treatment. Without sentimentality or rhetoric, it follows a Mexican farmworker on his illegal journey into California, which he soon discovers is hardly the land of opportunity. Roberto (Domingo Ambriz) will inevitably return to Mexico  that much is certain from the film's opening sequence, which shows him in circumstances far more peaceful and accommodating than anything he will find north of the border. Mr. Young accepts at the outset that Roberto's pilgrimage is futile and unavoidable, and then goes quietly about the business of detailing the trip.Mr. Young, who made ""Short Eyes"" and the current ""Rich Kids"" after directing ""Alambrista!"" for public television, shows himself to be a superb cinematographer, not just because ""Alambrista!"" is handsome, but also because it adapts so readily to the large screen. Instead of seeming broadly detailed or full of empty spaces, as many made-for-television films might in a theatrical setting, ""Alambrista!"" has an unexpected intimacy in its present form. The encounters are brief but uncommonly vivid. And the details, presented unobtrusively, ring true.Roberto, who speaks no English and is in any case nave, gets quite an education during the course of the story. He meets Joe (Trinidad Silva), who gives him a hilarious lesson in how to march into a cafe, cross his legs like a gringo, order a gringo's breakfast (""what you really want is tortillas and beans  but here you order ham-eggs-coffee"") and flirt with the waitress. This last activity is anathema to Roberto at first; he is married in Mexico, with his mother leaving nearby, and hasn't fully made the move from a society of women to a society of men. But the film watches him adjust more comfortably to the company of the other male farmworkers after a time. And besides, the screenplay has a waitress in store.The portion of the film that introduces Roberto to Sharon (played sweetly by Linda Gillin), who can't help but take him home after he falls asleep in the luncheonette at which she works, is its most delicate passage. Mr. Young uses Sharon as a way of underscoring the paradoxical quality of Roberto's new life  there's a tiny, touching scene in which Sharon helps him buy a money order and send it off to his family, realizing only afterward this means he must be married. Sharon also takes him to a feverish revival meeting and to a department store, two places that make Roberto's foreignness seem most acute. His status as an outsider is the thing about Roberto that Mr. Young is most intent on capturing, and in this he clearly and affectingly succeeds.""Alambrista!"" will be shown today at the Paramount Theater, as part of the American Independents series.",1979-09-23T05:00:00+0000

In short, this is the sort of territory that a few veteran practitioners like Rosemary Sutcliff can transform into high romance and which less skilled writers are apt to clutter up with highflown verbiage.

us,Screen: 'Rape of Love' by Miss Bellon:The Cast,"Imagine a nice young Frenchwoman  no, imagine a perfect young Frenchwoman. She is kind, generous, intelligent and absolutely gorgeous. She has a loving fianc, devoted friends and an interesting career. And then, just after ""Rape of Love"" has invited the audience's unqualified respect and admiration for her, she is brutally attacked by four men, in a rape sequence that is long, vicious and almost unbearably harrowing. The emotional power of this episode is beyond question. At this point, the director, Yannick Bellon, has the audience in the palm of her hand.That Miss Bellon then proceeds to fritter away her film's forcefulness is both unfortunate and objectionable. An audience that has weathered such a grueling ordeal deserves to feel that it has witnessed these horrors for a reason. But the latter part of ""Rape of Love"" is nothing more urgent than dull, dutiful propaganda  a feminist comic strip, with dialogue that ought to be coming out of balloons. Kind, understanding woman lawyer: ""A silent victim is an accomplice."" Courageous rape victim: ""I'll see it through."" Victim's supportive best friend: ""You're not alone.""The rapists are presented in similar terms. While committing the crime, they demonstrate their hatred of women with clarity that would do a textbook proud, and at least one of the men indicates that he is covertly attracted to the others. Later, the ring-leader is seen at home, dandling his wife on his knee. ""I'm scared of breaking my little woman,"" he jibes. ""You don't mind my breaking my back doing laundry,"" says she.Much of ""Rape of Love,"" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, plods along in this well-meaning but hopelessly didactic tone. Some children are seen playing, and they decide on a game of bank robbery  but a little girl, after anouncing she wants to be a gangster, is told,""Forget it, you're a teller,"" by a little boy. The rape victim and her friend visit a school and look at perhaps two dozen children's drawings, all of them saying the same thing: Mom does the cooking, and Dad goes to work. There is talk about how flowers are pollinated, and about whether rape exists in the animal kingdom. Every scene has a point, and every point is made in triplicate. Even the wispy, weepy theme song is played several different times.The trouble with such a commonsense approach is that the crime seems as much a violation of logic as of the victim's body. And Miss Bellon is so determined to present the issue in calm, considered terms that she neglects its terrifying irrationality. Indeed, in her film, the victim recovers more quickly and easily than perhaps the viewer will. When it is mentioned, months after the incident, that she has been afraid to make love with her fianc since the rape occurred, the information simply doesn't match what's on the screen. Despite her ordeal, she still seems as perfect as ever.Nathalie Nell, who plays the rape victim, is a lovely, gifted actress who makes ""Rape of Love"" more involving than it otherwise could be. Miss Nell has a cool beauty and a sharp, commanding gaze, qualities that don't exactly suit her character but certainly hold an audience's attention. It is never especially plausible that a woman of such fierce and evident pride would wait months before going to the police, or be in love with the kind of man who would regard an attack on her as an embarrassment rather than an outrage. But Miss Nell, who has made other films but has not previously been seen by American audiences, makes a spellbinding impression  the kind that guarantees she'll have a chance to work with material better suited to her talents later on.",1979-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Mattie, a middle-aged widow, lives alone on a substantial spread in the pinewoods. She's not a recluse but she has given up society. It's easier that way. She works her place for her immediate needs, pays her bills on time, takes care of her cat and smokes a pipe to relax. Within her community, Mattie is a woman of property.Enter Trax, a no-good, untrustworthy, womanizing scamp with a gift of gab and an air of totally bogus gallantry. Trax, in need of money, courts Mattie, who is old enough to be his mother. Mattie is charmed as much by the transparency of his courtship as by his energy and youth.Finally, when Trax proposes, Mattie feels compelled to ask why he'd want to marry someone as old and tired as she is. Trax hesitates, then says with as much conviction as he's ever mustered, ""Why not? There's not a thing wrong with you.""""Gal Young Un,"" an astonishingly good first feature, written, directed, photographed, edited and produced by Victor Nuez, is the story of the peculiar marriage of Mattie and Trax, in which Trax, after fighting a losing battle against his natural inclinations, embraces them wholeheartedly. By threatening to leave her, he blackmails the law-abiding Mattie to finance his moonshine operation and to become his chief distiller. Soon enough Trax is spending most of his time in the big cities, attending to his business and living high on the profits.Trax comes home only to pick up another load of liquor and to leave his laundry for Mattie to wash. She doesn't complain. She bides her time, but if you think Mattie will be bested by Trax, you don't know the kind of woman she is, or the kind of writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was.""Gal Young Un,"" based on Mrs. Rawlings's 1932 story, is a most invigorating and comic film, though I don't think there's one actual laugh in it. However, make no mistake about it, it is funny, partly because it's so far from being a tragedy. Though she's no earth mother, Mattie is healthily robust, a woman of substantial reserves. She keeps her own counsel, and her reaction to Trax's predictable ways is touching, sweet and surprisingly satisfying.The film will be shown at the Paramount Theater today at 9 P.M. as part of the Festival of Independent American Films being held in conjunction with the forthcoming New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. It will be shown again tomorrow at the Paramount at 3 P.M.I know very little about Mr. Nuez except that he lives and works in Florida, but if he's representative of our new regional film makers, things are looking up.""Gal Young Un"" is a very good, fully realized movie, shot in the Florida back country that so fascinated Mrs. Rawlings (""South Moon Under,"" ""The Yearling,"" etc.). Further, it has three extraordinarily effective leading performances.Though Dana Preu, who plays Mattie, is an English professor and has apparently never acted before, she is riveting to watch. Hers is the kind of face the camera loves to read, though it can never see everything. Something is always held in reserve. I'm not sure if this is acting but the result is clearly a performance.That David Peck, who plays Trax, is an actor is evident in the richness of detail in his comic deceit. His Trax is the sort of cad who always seems to be aware of how dreadfully he's behaving, though that never stops him from going right on. The third important cast member is a young actress named J. Smith, who plays the waif Trax takes up with for a while and then, when he tires of her, more or less abandons with Mattie. This girl, Elly, never says very much but she doesn't have to. She possesses the biggest, most expressive eyes you may have seen all year.The film's period details and technical credits are first-rate. Especially good are Mr. Nuez's camera work and the country-music score by Charles Engstrom. I'd also like to mention Pat Gabriel, who in addition to being the film's grip, is credited as the trainer of Mattie's cat. This cat, a large, handsome yellow creature, doesn't do tricks. Like Spencer Tracy, it never appears to be acting. It simply behaves  beautifully  and never once does it stare at the camera. As superior cat performances go, it's a match for the cat that Robert Altman used so hilariously in ""The Long Goodbye.""",1979-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Bush Mama' Tells Story of a Coast Ghetto:Hartford Ballet to Offer Chilean 'Carmina Burana',"DOROTHY (Barbara O. Jones) is a woman who hears voices  nothing intelligible, just a headful of kaleidoscopic noise. These sounds both insulate and plague her as she wanders numbly through Haile Gerima's ""Bush Mama,"" a film about ghetto life with a Los Angeles setting and a forcefulness that transcends its specific locale.""Bush Mama"" is fiery, furious, overflowing with rhetoric and slightly out of breath. The Ethiopian-born Mr. Gerima made the film as his thesis project at the University of California at Los Angeles, with a low budget and a lot of audacity. Its rough edges, occasional incoherence and polemical urgency all mark it as an especially passionate early effort.Mr. Gerima is so single-mindedly committed to his film's political stance that its dramatic aspect often gets blurred. Dorothy evolves from a sleep-walker into a new version of the African militant heroine whose poster adorns her wall, a transition that is signaled by her killing a white policeman and throwing away her wig. Before a Kafkaesque arrest scene triggers this conclusion, Dorothy spends much of her time in a daze. Her friends remark that she drinks to excess; one of them even says she's suffered brain damage. At charges of this sort, Dorothy merely shrugs. Her days are devoted to walking down to the welfare office and fighting half-heartedly with bureaucrats. That seems to have sapped all of her energy.""Bush Mama,"" which will be shown today and tomorrow at the Paramount Theater as part of the American Independents series, has a visual style as jumbled as its soundtrack, though this quality of sensory overload is as dulling to the eye as it is provocative to the ear. The film's principals, all of them very strong players, emerge from a cluster of vividly sketched lesser figures, like a man who claims to be a prince and eats only ""prince food"" (he then describes an exotic dish that turns out to be a hamburger). Everyone in Dorothy's life is stronger and more vehement than she  from a lover (Johnny Weathers) who becomes radicalized in jail, to a neighbor (Cora Lee Day) who sounds full of bluster but is stubbornly on the side of the white man.The sense of these characters' imprisonment and frustration is the film's most vivid message, far more powerful than the angry declaration at which Dorothy finally arrives. And the dissatisfaction extends to issues both large and small. ""We claim that we right on,"" says Dorothy's lover, ""and they come right back at us with 'Right On' deodorant."" A neighbor's daughter begins hanging angry posters in Dorothy's apartment because her own mother doesn't approve of such things. ""Militant stuff,"" the young woman explains. ""Well, I guess that's anything Mama don't want to know about.""One of these posters shows a black man who has been shot 25 times by the police. A bold headline says as much, but Mr. Gerima deliberately keeps his camera away from the photograph until Dorothy herself is willing to stare at it with outrage, and almost with surprise. This is an unusually delicate stroke in a generally broader film with little time or patience for such telling details.",1979-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Like Henry Martinson, Ray was an early organizer for the Nonpartisan League, a populist movement that revolutionized prairie politics in the years before World War I.Henry realizes this story is important and he pushes himself to write it down, which he does on an electric typewriter. With just the smallest hint of humor, Henry says, ""I'm not getting any younger.""Henry Martinson is a real person, for 28 years the labor commissioner of North Dakota and a former secretary of the Socialist Party. His recollections provide the frame for ""Northern Lights,"" the stunningly photographed, fictionalized story of Ray Sorenson and other farmers like him who were radicalized in the first decades of this century. The film is the first dramatic feature by Rob Nilsson and John Hanson, both of whom have roots in the Middle West and are documentary film makers.When ""Northern Lights"" stays close to the soil of North Dakota and to the events that shaped its political history, it is splendid. It becomes uncertain and ineffectual when it attempts to make dramatic the private lives of Ray (Robert Behling) and Inga (Susan Lynch), the girl he wants to marry.""Northern Lights"" will be shown at 9 P.M. today at the Paramount Theater as part of the Festival of American Independent Films being held in conjunction with the forthcoming New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. It will be shown again at the Paramount tomorrow at 3 P.M.Mr. Nilsson and Mr. Hanson are remarkably successful in integrating their professional actors (at least, they are so good I assume they are professionals) with the non-professionals who also appear in the film. And when the film's focus is on labor history, remembered or recreated, it is extremelly moving. Fortunately this is most of the time.They are not so successful, though , when they shift  like authors moving from a third- to a first-person narrative  to the personal stories of Ray and Inga. Mr. Behling, who looks like a cousin to the Carradine brothers, and Miss Lynch are both good actors, but their material doesn't measure up to the rest of the movie. It seems to have been dictated by a 70's sensibility.What one remembers of ""Northern Lights"" are the more general things  the look of the winter landscape during a funeral, when the mourners are black silhouettes and the sun is a dim white disk in a gray sky; the faces of the farmers as they listen to Ray's organizing speech, the jokes and songs at family celebrations. These things have the truth of reportage of a very high order.What one remembers best of all is Henry Martinson, whose memory is our periscope on the past. Mr. Martinson is the subject of ""Survivor,"" a documentary that Mr. Nilsson and Mr. Hanson completed after making ""Northern Lights."" That is a film I don't want to miss.",1979-09-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Seltzer: A Renaissance in Fizz,"ONCE a month on Wednesday nights, the man's connection conies  a lean bluejeaned young man with long hair (a hippie, his mother would say), schlepping a weathered case of seltzer to an apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The man keeps the case under his kitchen counter, always minus two of the venerable siphon bottles, which he cools in his refrigerator. He drinks his seltzer straight. For his children he mixes his seltzer with Fox's UBet syrups, just the way they did in the candy stores of his childhood; and to much the same delighted reception. He is one of the thousands of New Yorkers joined in a symbiotic relationship with a handful of dealers that has created a renaissance in the seltzer. trade. At a time when the haut monde has turned to Perrier and other sparkling waters in its relentless effort to inject all life with effervescence, a coincidence of nostalgia and the desire for unadulterated products and calorieless treats has focused attention on the city's ineradicable and thriving seltzer underground. While a few oldtimers still practice the seltzer trade among a clientele of oldtimers, the new wave is characterized by dealers in their 20's and 30's and a clientele returning to the ways of their parents and grandparents. There to meet them are companies with names like Gimme Seltzer, Seltzer Unlimited and Marty the Seltzer Man. What they are offering, now as in the past, is a product that contains nothing more and nothing less than thricefilteredtered water and carbon dioxide. No salts; no flavors; no preservatives  a trio that is sweet music the palates of the health conscious. What they bring is a 10case of 26ounce bottles, all definitely recycled, since none is younger than 40 years old, a result of the fact that the manufacture of seltzer bottles hereabouts is a dead art. And what they take away are the empties, and $4 or $4.50. While the competing international and domestic behemoths of the sparkling water trade plow large sums into advertising, the new breed of seltzerman is characterized by simple, straightforward praise for his product. Probably one of the most uncomfortable things to carry home in a shopping bag is bottles of soda, said Ron Roth of Seltzer Unlimited. We deliver it for you. But seltzer is really a good product. I don't have to lie about it to sell it. It's a pure, clean natural beverage, and on top of that, it's fun to play with. Mr. Roth, apparently a Pavlovian theorist, used seltzer to train his cat. Every time I saw him on one of my speakers, I squirted him. It was very effective. Effective, too, was the use of seltzer by generations of comedians from the Silent Era onward, who used a quick squirt to deflate the pompous and drench the starchy. Seltzer was brought to the United States by Jewish immigrants in the early part of this century. David Alan Kirsch, the executive vice president of Kirsch Beverages Inc., recalled not long ago that when his grandfather Hyman, the company's founder, arrived in New York from Russia in 1904, the streets were so full of seltzer wagons that he decided to make fruitflavored sodas rather than compete. The wheel turns, observed Mr. Kirsch, noting that in this, its 75th anni- versary year, Kirsch Beverages Inc., has become the exclusive distributor for Montclair SparWhere To Get It, How To Use It See Page C6",1979-09-26T05:00:00+0000

A prime example is its circumvention of a recent State Supreme Court decision, in Sundheimer v. Kolb, that provided financial assistance for natural parents caring for their retarded children at home. As a result of the state's action, Willowbrook parents are soon to return to Federal court to urge, once again, compliance with the detree.",1979-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: New Bertolucci Opens 17th Festival:Mother and Son,"EUROPEANS have a tolerance and often even an enthusiasm for a sort of intellectualized romanticism that tends to strike most Americans as bunkum. A French film maker and critic on the order of Francois Truffaut sees the late Luchino Visconti's ""Conversation Piece,"" which opened the annual New York Film Festival some years ago, as the moving statement of a great artist nearing the end of his career. We, here, see a group of artificial characters speaking lines (badly dubbed into English) of breathtaking fatuousness.No matter how civilized we Americans think we are, we find it nearly impossible to walk with both feet off the ground at the same time. We are incurably literal minded. We keep thinking of gravity.This, I suppose, explains my skeptical reactions to Bernardo Bertolucci's new film, ""Luna,"" about a beautiful, successful, willful, American star of grand opera and her brief, unsatisfactory love affair with her 15-year-old son, who is a junkie  which may well be the most obscure movie metaphor of all time. The film, which opens the 17th annual New York Film Festival tonight at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center, is one of the most sublimely foolish movies ever made by a director of Mr. Bertolucci's acknowledged talents.He has taken comparable risks before and brought them off  in ""Before the Revolution,"" ""The Conformist"" and especially in ""Last Tango in Paris."" In those films, he seemed scarcely able to control the ideas, the feelings and the sense impressions that poured forth as imagery of both rude and dazzling brilliance. If the brilliance seemed more like applied dcor in ""1900,"" it often looks secondhand in ""Luna,"" which is the work of a good poet on an absolutely terrible day.Mr. Bertolucci has been a poet. In 1962, at the age of 21, he was awarded Italy's Viareggio Prize for his book of poems ""In Search of Mystery."" He is still a poet, but now when he comes up with a clinker he can't roll up the paper and throw it away. Too much money is involved, and too many livelihoods and reputations.""Luna"" is an original screenplay by Mr. Bertolucci, his younger brother Giuseppe and Clare Peploe, an Englishwoman who was associated with the director on ""1900"" and, before that, with Michelangelo Antonioni as an assistant director on ""Zabriskie Point."" Good luck doesn't follow her around.The difficulty in dealing with Mr. Bertolucci is that he doesn't seem to be an artist totally devoid of humor. Because of that, I kept feeling that ""Luna"" really intended to be funny  laughably funny  when it was being most outrageous. I don't think it is, however. I suspect he wants us to be both moved and shocked by the awful plight of Caterina (Jill Clayburgh), the opera star, and her deeply troubled son Joe, played by Matthew Barry in the snippy manner of the child actor who played Sidney-the-sissy in the Our Gang comedies of my youth.Caterina, in the person of Miss Clayburgh, comes close to being a great character. She's a mass of contradictions. She's selfish but generous, loving but forgetful, self-absorbed but truly responsive to her art. When Miss Clayburgh says to her son, whose passivity infuriates her, ""I come from a world where singing and creating and dreaming mean something,"" we believe her, for neither the first nor the last time. It's a fine, complex performance in a movie that isn't.When Caterina's husband dies at the start of the film, she quite cruelly uproots Joe from his American roots and takes him to Rome, where she has an extended contract. Joe, who worships her, is once again forced to take second place in her affections as she pursues her career with the happy intensity of a liberated widow. Joe turns to hard drugs, and mom, when she realizes what's happened, turns to Joe. There's nothing silly about the situation, but there is about the way Mr. Bertolucci handles it.One of the movie's grand set-pieces is a scene in which Joe, beginning to feel the terrible need for a fix, is comforted by his ingenuously sexy mother. As she cradles him, he starts sucking at her breast. Her response is to masturbate him to a climax and then, we are led to assume, to a peaceful, drugless snooze. As bizarre scenes go, it is far less shocking than schematic. I also wonder about its medical accuracy, because I've always understood that such giddy sexual activity was impossible for an addict. Has Mr. Bertolucci discovered a substitute for Methadone? But there I go  being literal again.However, for all of Vittorio Storaro's gloriously pretty photography, and for all of the extended excerpts from ""Il Trovatore,"" ""La Traviata,"" ""Rigoletto"" and ""Un Ballo in Maschera"" (which we hear with Miss Clayburgh faultlessly lip-synching the words), ""Luna"" remains earthbound. It keeps demanding that we take it literally.The film might work on a poetic level if Mr. Bertolucci didn't insist on turning Joe into a rather conventional case history of an unloved, neglected child. ""I can do all the things dad does for you,"" the poor kid says ominously early in the picture. Later he must scream like someone in a soap opera that his mother doesn't love him and never has. Still later, Caterina has to moan, ""Oh, God, what have I done to you!""No amount of purloined Verdi can transform these banalities into anything else, while the film's ending, if it means what it certainly seems to mean, would embarrass a backstage Broadway musical movie, much less a backstage Rome opera movie.There are a number of isolated moments that are powerful and convulsively harrowing, but such effects are not difficult to achieve when you show such things as a desperate drug addict jabbing his arm with a fork in lieu of a hypodermic needle. Miss Clayburgh is extraordinary under impossible circumstances. There are also good supporting performances by Renato Salvatori, Fred Gwynne, Alida Valli and Tomas Milian, but none of these things can disguise the movie's grandiosity.Mr. Bertolucci's methods are no longer so interesting that we'll make allowances for ultimate muddle. Perhaps the Europeans will.",1979-09-28T05:00:00+0000

In his later years, when he was firmly established as one of the leading Realist painters of his time, he did almost everything he could to conceal and suppress this aspect of his early career and he remained extremely touchy about all his life.

us,Screen: H.G. Wells Trails Jack the Ripper into 1979:Down the Years,"""TIME AFTER TIME"" is every bit as magical as the trick around which it revolves. Let us say  or let Nicholas Meyer, who wrote and directed the film, say  that in the year 1893, a very special dinner party is being given by H.G. Wells. He plans to announce that a Time Machine, which looks rather like a rococo jukebox, has been constructed, and to demonstrate how his invention works. He won't actually use the thing  too timid for that, he admits, while showing his friends how to operate the controls. But one of these friends has been moonlighting as Jack the Ripper, and will soon be needing to make a fast getaway from Wells's home  in fact, from Wells's century! What choice will Wells have but to follow? Ah!The rest of the film is set in November 1979  and by then, ""Time After Time"" will have won plenty of accolades and tickled a lot of fancies. Mr. Meyer isn't a particularly skilled director; this is his first attempt, and on occasion it's very clumsy. But as a whizkid he's gone straight to the head of the class, with a movie that's as sweet as it is clever, and never so clever that it forgets to be entertaining. The satisfactions ""Time After Time"" offers are perhaps no more sophisticated than the fun one might have with an intricate set of electric trains. Still, fun of this sort isn't always easy to come by, not after one's age has climbed up into two digits. There's a lot to be said for an adult's movie with the shimmer of a child's new toy.Of course, one viewer's favorite bit of whimsy is another viewer's ""Harold and Maude""  there's no accounting for taste when it comes to film fantasy. But once it arrives in 1979, with Wells hot on the Ripper's trail, ""Time After Time""  which opens today at Loew's New York 2 and other theaters  begins relying on a gimmick of more general appeal. Wells, whose utopian tenets have received a nod or two in the opening sequence, starts off looking suspiciously like Tom Swift with a social conscience. But when he arrives in 1979  which does not live up to his expectations, needless to say  he brings a quick-witted, comic delight to each new mystery.Confronted by a newspaper headline like ""Colts Maul Rams,"" Malcolm McDowell's Wells takes an obvious enjoyment in unraveling every riddle. The screenplay has Amy Robbins (Mary Steenburgen), the modern-day woman with whom Wells falls in love, describing him as having a ""little boy lost quality,"" something that could have been poisonously adorable. But Mr. McDowell remains clear of that, combining the character's quick-witted ingenuity with a fine sense of mischief. There's a good deal of pantomime in the performance, as when he watches someone else hailing a taxi and tries, hilariously, to imitate the process; Mr. McDowell has a particular gift for this sort of clowning. He does even better with the sly wit of Mr. Meyer's screenplay, particularly in a scene that has him lunching with Miss Steenburgen. ""I like that suit, is that what they're wearing in England?"" she coos. ""It was when I left,"" says he.Wells has landed in San Francisco, because the Time Machine is now part of a traveling museum exhibit. ""It was never known to have worked,"" a little card announces. Mr. Meyer's screenplay, based on a story by Karl Alexander and Steve Hayes, is wise in keeping Wells' behavior logical and his confusion to a minimum. So he is soon canvassing banks  at one he meets Miss Steenburgen  since he needs American currency and supposes the Ripper has met with the same problem. And midway through the story, which takes a lengthy sidetrack to follow the romance, he sneaks back to the museum with Miss Steenburgen to show her that the Time Machine indeed works. At this juncture, Mr. Meyer's sneakiest twist brings the tale emphatically back to its initial, suspenseful mood, as Miss Steenburgen becomes a damsel in distress. Giving the leading lady a strong dose of Valium makes a fine 1979 equivalent to the weary old business of tying her to the railroad tracks.David Warner, who plays the Ripper, is superbly seedy, moving effortlessly from the story's initial Victorian setting to the strip joints of San Francisco's North Beach area. ""I belong here completely,"" he tells a horrified Wells. ""I'm home."" Indeed, Mr. Warner so effectively makes the film's point about the timelessness of evil that the screenplay's further remarks on the subject seem redundant. (""Violence is contagious, like measles,"" Mr. McDowell is called upon to say.)Miss Steenburgen, who played Jack Nicholson's bride in ""Goin' South,"" this time takes some getting used to, perhaps because her dizzy, disarming manner at first recalls Diane Keaton's too strongly. But she emerges as a funny and affecting figure, one of the nicest surprises the movie has to offer.Purists may quibble with Mr. Meyer's hedging on a crucial point  it becomes essential, at one stage, to know whether the movie supposes that a time-traveling character can change history, and this information is never supplied. More damaging is Mr. Meyer's inability to create a strong visual contrast between his 19th-century characters and their incongruous new setting. And his pessimism about the present makes this a homely movie, since it's filled to the gills with garish modern knickknacks and gray urban vistas. Well, it can't be easy to make parking meters look pretty.""Time After Time"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains several murder scenes, one of them unexpectedly brutal, and some sexual innuendo to go with its central romance.",1979-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Legacy':A Certain Ring,"""THE LEGACY"" is a horror film that is not so much frightening as it is depressing. It is thin and dopey, which is perfectly O.K., but in place of invention it uses contrivance, and in place of imagination it uses shock: an old Nazi is burned to a pile of suet and the suet is fed to the Dobermans; a rock star gets a big hunk cut from his throat; a hotelier has his face blown off. Meanwhile, the stately English home where everything happens is gorgeous. The stars are handsome, too. The movie is at odds with itself.Two Los Angeles architects, played by Katharine Ross and Sam Elliott, are summoned to a job in England. They meet the owner of the stately home, who appears to be, say, 45, but is really an ancient kept evergreen by pills. The pills apparently are supplied by Lucifer; so are the rings worn by the ancient and his colleagues. The rings are the source of wealth, power and success, and someone connected with ""The Legacy"" has been reading Tolkien.One by one the ring bearers die their filthy deaths, all of them brought about by the ancient, who looks by now like melted wax. He is about to expire, too, although first he passes on Lucifer's power to Miss Ross. ""What are you going to do with it?"" Mr. Elliott asks. ""Anything I want,"" she answers. This is more depressing than the charred suet.Throughout all this, Miss Ross and Mr. Elliott are laid back, as they say, and very modern, and sometimes Mr. Elliott seems to be dozing off. The director, Richard Marquand, may have something in mind here about the banality of evil, but it comes off as rather attractive instead. As a morality tale, this is not much. The film opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters.",1979-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Black Jack':The Cast,"The 18th and 20th centuries collide head-on in Kenneth Loach's ""Black Jack,"" which will be shown tonight at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 4:30 P.M., as part of the New York Film Festival. Mr. Loach's film, adapted from a novel by Leon Garfield, is set in 1750. But many of its methods are deliberately and jarringly modern. The dialogue overlaps, as it might in a film of Robert Altman's. The pastoral English vistas are suffused with a painterly light, as they were in ""Barry Lyndon."" The language is relatively contemporary, and the plot, for all its period details, takes a psychiatric turn. Mr. Loach simply sets these elements in motion and lets them go to war.The story has to do with a young girl named Belle Carter (played with a keen intensity by Louise Cooper), whose parents consider her insane. The occasion of an older sister's prestigious marriage induces the parents to pack Belle off to an asylum, because they fear their new in-laws may think the child's problem is hereditary. In fact, she has been violent and uncommunicative since she suffered a severe fever at age 5.But Belle escapes in midjourney, aided by Tolly (Stephen Hirst), a boy her own age, and Black Jack (Jean Franval), a surly, mysterious Frenchman who has miraculously survived his own hanging as the film begins. These three refugees fall in with an itinerant circus of sorts, full of people who speak simultaneously and roam the aformentioned beautifully lit landscapes.Key figures in the circus are three dwarves, a shyster doctor who sells youth serum (Packy Byrne), and a small boy (Andrew Bennett), who is growing into quite a large thief. This boy quickly solves the mystery of Belle's origins and sets to work cheerfully blackmailing both her parents and the asylum proprietors who've lost her.There is a lot more going on in ""Black Jack,"" which shared the International Critics' Prize at Cannes this year. But it isn't always easy to decipher. Mr. Loach's actors, some of whom seem to be nonprofessionals, appear to be doing a lot of improvising. And they do it in thickly Yorkshire-accented monotones, which might be more intelligible if there weren't also a lot of mumbling going on. Mr. Hirst, the young lead, is particularly hard to hear, and his big breakthrough moment with Belle is disappointingly flat. Mr. Bennett, as the thief, speaks just as blankly. But he brings to the character such unmistakable cunning that he's never in danger of being misunderstood.",1979-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Wise Blood,' Huston's 33d Feature:The Cast","""Wise Blood,"" based on Flannery O'Connor's 1952 novel about an inside-out religious fanatic of the rural South, is one of John Huston's most original, most stunning movies. It is so eccentric, so funny, so surprising and so haunting that it is difficult to believe it is not the first film of some enfant terrible instead of the 33d feature by a man who is now in his 70's and whose career has had more highs and lows than a decade of weather maps.Mr. Huston's affection for misfits has never been more profoundly expressed than in this uproarious tale about Hazel Motes, a young Army veteran who returns home from the wars  one assumes Vietnam  obsessed with the idea of founding a Church of Christ without Christ. Hazel Motes is no Elmer Gantry and ""Wise Blood"" is no expos of well-paying religious fakery, although it is about salvation.Hazel's success as a preacher is minimal, even in a region where the crazier the homemade religion, the more likely it is to be popular. Small crowds do listen to Hazel as he stands on the hood of his battered car, and some people are taken by his creed: ""I'm a member and preacher to that church where the blind don't see and the lame don't walk and what's dead stays that way."" But Hazel is too preoccupied with his own visions to organize his church and reap the financial rewards. He is ruled by fears and furies of the unloving Jesus of his childhood, when his grandfather was a hellfire-and-brimstone preacher.""Wise Blood"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival at 9 P.M. today and at 7 P.M. tomorrow. Its commercial opening has not been set.Mr. Huston's best films have always been about misfits of one sort or another, from the early ones, ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre,"" through ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and ""The African Queen"" to his most recent production, ""The Man Who Would Be King,"" in 1975.The New York Festival's program makes a mistake, I think, in saying that ""Wise Blood"" marks a return by the director to the ""hardheaded"" style of his ""Fat City."" As much as I admired ""Fat City,"" it seems to me that ""Wise Blood"" is more evocative of ""Beat the Devil,"" the slapdash comedy classic written by Truman Capote. The seriously lunatic characters in ""Wise Blood"" are much closer kin to the would-be thieves in ""Beat the Devil"" than they are to the losers in the gritty, realistic ""Fat City.""Like all fine fiction writers, Miss O'Connor created a self-contained world that was immediately recognizable although very bizarre. No matter how odd the characters and how grotesque the events, one believes in her world because, among other things, it is consistent within itself.This is one of the achievements of ""Wise Blood,"" which is lyrically mad and absolutely compelling even when we don't fully comprehend it. Shot in the South, the film presents us with familiar landscapes in which, however, all the people appear to be just slightly removed from the reality we know. This applies equally to casual passersby and to someone like the county sheriff, who appears in one brief, hilarious scene, and to the principal characters.In addition to Hazel Motes, beautifully played by Brad Dourif (the stuttering kid in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""), these include Sabbath Lilly Hawks (Amy Wright), a libidinous teen-ager who looks as if she had grown up drinking Cokes and eating French fries and never coming near a green vegetable; Asa Hawks (Harry Dean Stanton), her evil-tempered father, a conventionally fraudulent side-walk preacher; Enoch Emery (Daniel Shor), a crazy country boy who finds a ""new"" Jesus at the local museum in the form of the tiny corpse of a shrunken South American Indian; Hoover Shoates (Ned Beatty), a fast-talking promoter who wants to manage Hazel's career as a prophet, and Hazel's landlady (Mary Nell Santacroce), the lonely, middle-age woman who falls in love with Hazel. They're all splendid. Mr. Huston himself appears in several lividly pink fantasy sequences as Hazel's grandfather.The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald is not neat by usual movie standards. Characters wander off never to be heard of again. The movie delights in the odd moment that doesn't obviously carry the story forward. Yet it's always alive. Mr. Fitzgerald also seems to have preserved a lot of Miss O'Connor's dialogue. Nowhere else might you hear someone say, ""Her hair was so thin it looked like ham gravy trickling down her skull,"" or another character, Hazel, defend himself and his second-hand wreck of an automobile with the statement, ""Nobody with a good car needs to be justified.""Hazel's journey toward salvation is terrifying, tortured and bloody; yet the end effect of the film is exhilarating, as it always is when you see something so well and seemingly so effortlessly realized. Mr. Huston is in top form.",1979-09-29T05:00:00+0000

The single performance of the film, which will be released theatrically, is sold out.Mr. Jones has created 20 minutes of new animation to link the old material, with Bugs looking back on his film career from his cliffhugging mansion in Beverly Hills. Once again Mel Blanc is the voice of the wiseguy rabbit, whose ""What's up, Doc?"" has, for better or worse, entered the language.Most of the film, which begins with a portentous opening that parodies ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman,"" is very funny, especially when Bugs tries to talk back to the artist who is creating him and is erased, turned into a four-legged bug and subjected to other indignities.However, having to watch Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote and other villains being smashed flat by falling boulders, blowing themselves up and meeting with other disasters again and again and again and again can be trying, possibly for children as well as adults.As for the Road Runner, created by Mr. Jones in 1948, one can only wish that Frank Perdue had reduced the sum to its parts.

ABC, the ratings leader, is generating less press attention with its new series than with the fact that it broke up a blockbuster combination on Tuesdays and, hoping to strengthen other areas, moved Laverne and Shirley and Mork and Mindy to different nights. Elsewhere, it is generally business as usual. The three networks are offering the public more kidvid (""The Misadventures Sheriff Lobo, 240Robert, The Last Resorts""), more spinoffs (""Sheriff Lobo and Benson"") and more ripoffs (""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century""). Some changes have been made on older series. Edith is no longer with Archie every week. Kate Jackson has fled from Charlie's Angels. And, outside prime time, Saturday Night Live will be returning without John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd. Several of the new series  The Associates, Benson and The Lazarus Syndrome, all on ABC  look promising. The news picture is unusually active as a game of executive musical chairs gets underway at the networks and as at least one magazine discovers the ratings pull of popmusic stars.

It is not only because we are ravished by the sheer visual beauty of Japanese art  though this in itself would be shock enough. (Ours, after all, is a culture that has taught itself to  distrust the very idea of the beautiful in art, and a critic who carried on about it nowadays would quickly find himself in intellectual disgrace.) It is also because of what has gone into the making of this beauty. I mean the sense of spiritual vocation that is often so central to its existence.

us,Film: A Slow Cloud of Gloom for a 'Short Memory':The Cast,"The light in Eduardo de Gregorio's ""Short Memory"" emanates from sources at a far remove from the characters  from outside a window if the actors are indoors, or from a lamp that casts their faces in shadow, or perhaps there's barely any light at all. In addition, the sound is muffled, as if the action were taking place under water. This might make for a perfect climate for contemplation if it did not become so evident, midway through ""Short Memory,"" that the effect existed solely for its own sake. The style is arresting at first, but after a time it grows actively unhelpful.Mr. de Gregorio, in attempting to combine a very studied brand of film noir with a meditation on guilt, keeps himself at least two removes from any real insight or urgency. The guilt, which in particular is French guilt about World War II, never emerges from the film's cloud of slow-moving gloom; as for the film noir, it requires more movement than the somnambulant stalking Mr. de Gregorio favors. The problem isn't just the film's muted mood  it's the combination of thoughtful atmosphere and ill-considered decisions that proves most maddening.One such touch is the casting of the same actor as a young man searching for Nazi war criminals and also  in flashbacks  as the criminals themselves. Never mind that the actor, Philippe Lotard, is slightly off-beam for any of these roles, because he must work so hard to eradicate a natural ease that's out of place in this solemn scheme. The real problem is this: Mr. de Gregorio's point in making multiple use of the man  that everyone is an accomplice, something along those lines  is much less important than the likelihood that the viewer will assume that Mr. Lotard, or perhaps his father, or perhaps his great-uncle Fred, actually was a war criminal. The intrigue plot of ""Short Memory"" isn't remotely strong enough to bear the weight of this confusion.The focus of the story is a glum, lonely UNESCO interpreter, played by Nathalie Baye, who seems the least likely person in the world to get involved in a Nazi-hunting scheme  perhaps that's the very idea. In any case, Miss Baye is seen reading and pacing and brooding for a long while before anything actually happens, although her research is interrupted by flashbacks, some of which feature the director Jacques Rivette. Mr. de Gregorio was a collaborator on several of Mr. Rivette's films, among them ""Celine and Julie Go Boating.""Bulle Ogier, the star of Mr. de Gregorio's ""Serail,"" appears this time as an Eva Pern figure, wearing spangled dinner clothes and a shrewd, icy smile. Unlike Miss Baye, who is intentionally so bland she can be upstaged by the activity on a televison screen in her gloomy living room, Miss Ogier makes a fine focus of attention. Her character, the very embodiment of evil, is the most broadly drawn figure in the film, and the simplest. Perhaps for that reason, she's the only one who seems to be all there.""Short Memory"" will be shown today at 2 and 9:30 P.M. as part of the New York Film Festival.",1979-09-30T05:00:00+0000
