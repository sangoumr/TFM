But many of the world's markets underwent consolidations and disappointments in the last three months, after rallies fueled by the allied victory in the Persian Gulf and the anticipation of an early economic recovery in the U.S. Stocks fell 3.6 percent in France, 2.5 percent in Britain and 7.4 percent in Japan. In the U.S., stock investors caught their breath after a strong previous quarter. [ Page D3. ] The Dow Jones industrial average closed 7.11 points lower for the quarter, and other indexes posted small declines. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.9 percent, while the American Stock Ex change index was down 0.3 percent and the over-the-counter index was down 1.3 percent. Of 3,999 stocks tracked by Media General, 1,891 were up in the quarter, and 1,951 were down, although more over-the-counter stocks rose than fell.

Present at the Creation","Sun Records has gone from the record label and studio that transformed popular music in the 1950's -- the first home of Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and others -- to an embarrassment, best known for its catalogue of nostalgia items for sale. (With Sun it doesn't stop at T-shirts and baseball hats: visitors searching for a piece of musical history can also rent time to record their own piece of Sun vinyl -- nowadays, tape.) But Sun began in 1952 as the dream of Sam Phillips. Mr. Phillips set about building his Memphis record company with one purpose: he wanted to record the rhythm and blues of the South, the people none of the mainstream labels would sign. Along the way he proved he had the talent (many would say the luck) and the wherewithal to sign the recording artists who played such a major role in the direction of pop music. In GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll (St. Martin's, $19.95), the independent British scholars Colin Escott and Martin Hawkins trace Sun's history from its pinnacle to its decline in the mid-60's. Rightly, the blame for the descent is placed on Mr. Phillips and his now-legendary refusal to pay his biggest stars what they deserved. Still, the main focus of the book is what really made Sun Records: the artists, each of whom receives a brief biographical chapter. There are some flaws: too many times twice-told tales are cited as fact, and the authors' reverence for the subject matter can make the reader wince. Still, reverence is appropriate. Who would have recorded Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Howlin' Wolf or Charlie Rich if not for Sun? Not any label that existed at the time.",1991-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Trump was even quoted as saying that because of the AIDS scare, his dates would all have to be tested at his doctor's office. But last week Mr. Trump asked Marla Maples for her hand in marriage (its ring finger will be bedecked with an eight-carat diamond). He proposed Tuesday at the home of Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford, where Marla was staying for a few days, and Ms. Gifford announced it the next day on her television show, ""Live With Regis & Kathie Lee."" And as for Carla Bruni, an Italian model who also keeps company with Mick Jagger? ""Carla's a friend and she's a very good girl,"" Mr. Trump said, ""but those stories were blown totally out of proportion.""",1991-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,N.F.L. TRAINING CAMPS,"These reports on the National Football League training camps and on the questions surrounding the 28 teams as they head into the 1991 season were prepared by Timothy W. Smith. A.F.C. EAST BUFFALO (13-3 last year) Camp opens July 14 for both rookies and veterans in Fredonia, N.Y. The defensive muscle along the front seven will be a big question. The Giants held the ball for nearly 41 minutes during the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, the Bills have only one Bruce Smith. They're hoping the acquisition of defensive end Reggie Rogers and nose tackle Odell Haggins can give them some additional strength up front. MIAMI (12-4) July 11 for rookies and veterans at St. Thomas University in Miami. Last season, a balanced rushing and passing attack, heavy on the run, put the Fish back in the swim of things for the first time since 1985. Can quarterback Dan Marino settle into a diminished role again for a run at the playoffs this year? INDIANAPOLIS (7-9) July 11 for rookies and July 18 for veterans at Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. Quarterback Jeff George earned his stripes during the latter half of last season, after some early season questions about his toughness. He's on the rise. Eric Dickerson is coming off the worst season of his career. Is he ready to move on? JETS (6-10) July 16 for rookies and veterans at Hofstra University in Hempstead, L.I. The Jets spent the off season beefing up the offensive line. They have a solid receiving corps and good running backs. Now, Coach Bruce Coslet needs a quarterback. Is Browning Nagle that man? He'll probably get a long look. NEW ENGLAND (1-15) July 11 for rookies and July 18 for veterans at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I. The Patriots have a new front office and new coach and staff. Unfortunately, they have the same team. Tom Hodson and Hugh Millen will battle for the starting quarterback job now that Marc Wilson and Steve Grogan have retired. A.F.C. CENTRAL CINCINNATI (9-7) July 18 for rookies and veterans at Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio. Midway through last season, quarterback Boomer Esiason started wondering what happened to his team's passing game. If fullback Ickey Woods, who was nursing a 1989 knee injury last season, makes it all the way back, Esiason might as well abandon the search. Linebacker James Francis is a monster on a weak defense, but will be looking for help from rookie linebacker Alfred Williams. HOUSTON (9-7) July 15 for rookies and July 18 for veterans at Trinity University in San Antonio. Quarterback Warren Moon seems to have recovered from a dislocated right thumb he suffered late last season. But how much any lingering discomfort affects his passing is another issue. Moon, 34, is coming off an otherworldly 1990 season in which he led the league in completions (362), attempts (584), yards (4,689) and touchdowns (33). PITTSBURGH (9-7) July 10 for rookies and veterans at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa. Receiver Louis Lipps, 28, seems to have lost some of his edge, so the Steelers will be looking to improve their receiving corps. The emergence of tight end Eric Green takes some of the pressure off. CLEVELAND (3-13) July 14 for rookies and veterans at Lakeland Community College in Mentor, Ohio. Name it, Cleveland needs it. The offensive line needs an extensive overhaul. Elbow and shoulder injuries, not to mention incessant pounding, have taken a heavy toll on quarterback Bernie Kosar in the last two years. The Browns don't have a choice but to start Kosar. The backup at this point is Todd Philcox, who spent two years on the Bengals' development squad. A.F.C. WEST LOS ANGELES RAIDERS (12-4) July 7 for rookies and July 12 for veterans at Radisson Hotel in Oxnard, Calif. Former Niners Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott have journeyed south to join the Raiders. Can they bring enough of San Francisco's magic with them? KANSAS CITY (11-5) July 17 for rookies and veterans at University of Wisconsin-River Falls. The Chiefs already had a full house at running back, with heavyweights Christian Okoye (260 pounds) and Barry Word (240). But now they've invited more guests, taking Troy Stradford and Richard Bell in Plan B and drafting Harvey Williams of L.S.U. in the first round. This is going to be interesting. SEATTLE (9-7) July 19 for rookies and veterans in Kirkland, Wash. Quarterback Dan McGwire, the Seahawks' first-round pick, has an excellent opportunity to move into the backup spot ahead of Kelly Stouffer. Starter Dave Krieg is 32. SAN DIEGO (6-10) July 15 for rookies and July 17 for veterans at University of California-San Diego in La Jolla, Calif. After successive 6-10 seasons, Coach Dan Henning might be on thin ice heading into the third year of a five-year deal. Part of his problem is that he hasn't had a decent quarterback to work with. Billy Joe Tolliver and John Friesz will duel for the starting job. DENVER (5-11) July 12 for rookies and veterans at Northern Colorado University in Greeley, Colo. The Broncos have tried everything from martial arts to running with small parachutes on their backs in an early effort to regroup from their 5-11 collapse last season. The return of left end Alphonso Carreker and cornerback Tyrone Braxton, back from season-ending knee injuries last year, should help. N.F.C. EAST GIANTS (13-3) July 15 for rookies and veterans at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J. Rookie Ed McCaffrey might fill the bill for a third receiver to complement Mark Ingram and Stephen Baker, although his lack of speed could be a concern. Phil Simms or Jeff Hostetler at quarterback is the big question here. PHILADELPHIA (10-6) July 15 for rookies and veterans at West Chester University in West Chester, Pa. Bud Carson, the Eagles' new defensive coordinator, will work on installing an aggressive 4-3 defense and dismantling the 46 style of former coach Buddy Ryan. WASHINGTON (10-6) July 14 for rookies and July 21 for veterans at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa. Has Gerald Riggs, 30, succumbed to age and the punishment that comes with being the lone back in a one-back formation? It doesn't look like Earnest Byner, who rushed for 1,219 yards last year, will move aside so Riggs can answer that question. DALLAS (7-9) July 14 for rookies and veterans at St. Edward's University in Austin, Tex. The Cowboys wheeled and dealed and Coach Jimmy Johnson said he expects 8 to 10 draft picks to make the team. The ones to watch are defensive end Russell Maryland, the No. 1 pick in the draft, and linebacker Dixon Edwards, the second-round pick. PHOENIX (5-11) July 16 for rookies and July 21 for veterans at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The Cardinals will try a new two-running-back system to get Johnny Johnson and Anthony Thompson on the field together. But all eyes will be on Cards' first-round pick Eric Swann, the defensive end with no college experience. N.F.C. CENTRAL CHICAGO (11-5) July 16 for rookies and veterans at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. Quarterback Mike Tomczak, in and out of Coach Mike Ditka's doghouse during his tenure in Chicago, has gone to Green Bay via Plan B. This clears the way for Jim Harbaugh, who will be looking over his shoulder at backup Peter Tom Willis after every bad pass. TAMPA BAY (6-10) July 19 for rookies and veterans at University of Tampa. The Bucs have a new defensive coordinator, Floyd Peters, who had Chris Doleman, Keith Millard and Joey Browner to work with for four seasons with the Vikings. Peters will try to convert Tampa Bay into a 4-3 defensive team without Doleman, Millard and Browner. It should be a fun year for Peters. DETROIT (6-10) July 14 for rookies and veterans at Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. Are the Lions ready to hand the controls over to Andre Ware, their first-round pick last year? Or will quarterback Rodney Peete, a fifth-round choice in 1989 who has done everything the Lions have asked, continue to confound the skeptics? GREEN BAY (6-10) July 15 for rookies and veterans at St. Norbert College in West De Pere, Wis. Quarterback Don Majkowski is coming back from December rotator cuff surgery. Mike Tomczak will be ready to step in if Majkowski falters. MINNESOTA (6-10) July 22 for rookies and veterans at Mankato State in Mankato, Minn. If there is a problem of having too much talent, then the Vikings have suffered through it for two seasons. The team has decided to work with a one-back system featuring Herschel Walker, who would also be split out of the set as a receiver. That's a start. N.F.C. WEST SAN FRANCISCO (14-2) July 10 for rookies and July 13 for veterans at Sierra Community College in Rocklin, Calif. The 49ers kept winning last year despite the fact that they weren't a very good rushing team. Roger Craig has gone to the L.A. Raiders through Plan B, leaving a scramble for a dominant replacement. Dexter Carter, a 5-7, 170-pound back with breakaway speed, will battle Keith Henderson, the prototypical N.F.L. back at 6-1, 220 pounds, for the starting job. NEW ORLEANS (8-8) July 14 for rookies and July 17 for veterans at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Quarterback Bobby Hebert, who sat out all of last season in a contract dispute, has signed and is ready to carry the Saints where Steve Walsh couldn't take them last year: into the playoffs. The weighty issue of how big fullback Craig (Ironhead) Heyward, who typically weighs over 260 pounds, should be to remain effective will be played out for the fourth season. LOS ANGELES RAMS (5-11) July 10 for rookies and July 19 for veterans at University of California-Irvine. Running back Cleveland Gary appears to be the all-around running back that the Rams need. He's a good runner and a fine receiver. But he has the propensity to fumble (12 last season). He'll be working on holding on to the ball more this year. ATLANTA (5-11) July 18 for rookies and veterans in Suwanee, Ga. June Jones, who worked with Jerry Glanville in Houston, has left Detroit and joined Glanville in Atlanta in an effort to put more spark into the Falcons' Red Gun offense. Unfortunately, Andre Rison, a brillant young receiver, is the only pass catcher the Falcons have who fits into the run-and-shoot style of offense.",1991-07-07T05:00:00+0000

It is, rather, the human backbiters and flesh-dispersers that the novel's author, Harold Robbins, as always wants us to concentrate on. But we quickly lose our concentration, and so, apparently, did Mr. Robbins while scribbling down this profoundly giggle-worthy, nearly indecipherable mess of a knockoff of ""The Godfather."" If it's about anything, it's about Jed Stevens, the half-Jewish scion of the all-Italian Di Stefanos of New York, and his rise. He goes from uninvolved family member to rich and powerful Family leader, all the while rubbing elbows and other body parts with those who jet between continents and beds with equally crude aplomb. Standard Robbins stuff, and yet there's something sad and musty about the novel. Mr. Robbins tries so hard to shock here, when in the past he did it so effortlessly. Since those halcyon days of ""A Stone for Danny Fisher"" and ""The Carpetbaggers,"" he has been caught and outdistanced by others who can outsex, outviolence and outgross him. In this non-whale of a tale that dishes up laughable dialogue and offers almost no physical description of anybody whatsoever, Mr. Robbins demonstrates that these newcomers can outwrite him, too.

Though the measure stands no chance of passing -- the Labor and Conservative parties oppose it -- four out of five Britons agree that the Queen should be taxed, according to a recent newspaper survey. The exemption is, after all, not exactly an age-old tradition. The practice began in 1937, when the Queen's father, King George VI, asked the Inland Revenue whether he had to pay taxes and was told no. The Queen's personal wealth is estimated at anywhere from $2 billion to $10 billion, and Mr. Hughes said her taxes would come to around $11.2 million a year.

LeMond, the three-time winner, who started the day in first place, finished 30th in the 161-mile stage from Arras to the port city of Le Havre. Sean Kelly of Ireland moved from third to second place over all. Marie moved out early and built a 22-minute margin that was whittled to less than two minutes by the end of the leg. Marie started his move with 145 miles left in the stage. The longest breakaway in the event's history was 157 miles by Albert Bourlon of France in 1947. At the end, Marie's margin and 32 seconds of bonuses gave him a lead of 1 minute 4 seconds over Kelly, who placed fourth in the stage behind Remig Stumpf of Germany and Djamolidine Abdoujapalov of the Soviet Union. Abdoujapalov, riding for Carrera, was tied for third with LeMond, 1:07 behind Marie. The stage started without Wednesday's leader, Rolf Sorensen of Denmark, who was forced to withdraw after breaking his collarbone in a fall. LeMond, who inherited the lead, refused to wear the yellow jersey during the stage out of respect for Sorensen, who flew to a sports clinic in Italy for surgery. Marie won the prologue and had the yellow jersey during the first stage, but gave it up to LeMond, who had gained enough bonus seconds to move into first place. LeMond subsequently turned the symbolic jersey over to Sorensen after the team time trial Sunday. (AP)",1991-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Easing Playground Falls","Each year hospital emergency rooms treat about 100,000 injuries resulting from falls to the ground from playground equipment. Such falls account for about 60 percent of all injuries on playground equipment. In a recent study, the Consumer Product Safety Commission tested materials that are commonly placed under playground equipment to reduce the possibility of injury. It compared each material's ""critical height,"" or the maximum height from which a child could fall without being likely to suffer a life-threatening injury. For example, if a 9-inch layer of uncompressed wood mulch is used, any fall of 10 feet or less is not expected to cause a potentially fatal injury. Previous tests on grass, dirt, asphalt and concrete, which are also used as playground surfaces, indicated that these materials have unacceptable cushioning properties.

In throwing out the case against Mr. Mulheren, who was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $1.6 million, the court said the evidence against him was ""threadbare"" and that the verdict ""defies reason."" Some lawyers said this and other reversals cast a shadow on Mr. Giuliani's tenure as a prosecutor. But Mr. Giuliani noted that he was no longer in office when cases were tried.

Young made his first records to reach the great public in 1936, with a wonderful small group that included Count Basie. Young's impact was strong because he opened up new vistas for the saxophone. His innovations included long-breathed, legato phrases, gliding unpredictably over chord changes, sometimes anticipating a chord before it arrived. Total technical and rhythmic security gave him the ability to play on, before or after the beat. He created a sound that was his alone -- haunting, floating, unforgettable.

Bonior of Michigan demonstrated some skill in the latter department on his way to being elected last week to succeed William H. Gray 3d as the House Democratic whip. For days before the vote, Mr. Bonior predicted that he would get 160 votes, which is exactly what he got. His opponent, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who had insisted that the race was neck and neck, got 109 votes. The victory will make the 46-year-old Mr. Bonior the third-ranking Democratic leader in the House after Mr. Gray leaves, probably in September, to head the United Negro College Fund. The new whip said that his last couple of campaigns -- a surprisingly slim re-election to the House in 1988 and a defeat for the whip position by Mr. Gray in 1989 -- had taught him a thing or two about getting votes. After 20 years in politics, he said, he ""went back to knocking on doors.""",1991-07-14T05:00:00+0000

The dance floor jumped with representatives of just about every demographic group in the county, and Queen Ida's drummer remarked that the turnout far exceeded the previous night's show at the Bottom Line in Manhattan.",1991-07-14T05:00:00+0000

The road, in its essentials, is the very same that Thoreau profitably rode back around 1845 when it was new, like his just-begun experiment in honest living at Walden Pond.

Not meant to be comprehensive but rather to convey the highlights, the book spans the history of the form from the first Broadway musical, ""The Black Crook"" in 1866, through vaudeville, burlesque and extravaganza to ""Miss Saigon."" Mr. Alpert, whose previous books include ""The Life and Times of Porgy and Bess,"" also provides anecdotes and information about the changing characteristics of the theater district, which was originally located between the Battery and 14th Street. The numerous photographs of theater memorabilia highlight everything from fluffy entertainments, such as ""Florodora"" in 1900, to shows with more serious themes, such as ""Of Thee I Sing,"" a political satire that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Landmark productions -- ""Porgy and Bess"" in 1935, ""Oklahoma!"" in 1943, ""West Side Story"" in 1957 and ""Hair"" in 1968 -- are shown as reflections of the cultural climate of the time. Mr. Alpert also discusses the development of black musical theater from the minstrel show to the first all-black production, ""A Trip to Coontown,"" in 1898. Although a chronology would have been a welcome addition, ""Broadway!"" is an informative and entertaining book that allows the reader to savor a uniquely American art form.",1991-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Fleisher, 42, sank his long putt on the 11th green and then watched as Baker-Finch missed from 25 feet to end the PGA's longest playoff since Bob Gilder needed eight extra holes to win at Phoenix in 1983. Fleisher, the 1968 United States Amateur champion, who got into the tournament as an alternate, shot a 64 in coming back from a faltering third round for his first PGA victory, which was worth $180,000. He left the tour in 1983 after 11 years without a victory but then returned a year ago. He finished at 268, 16 strokes under par. Baker-Finch forced a playoff with a birdie 4 on the 72d hole.(AP) Ziegler Wins, Finally: Larry Ziegler ended a 15-year victory drought with a record-breaking six-stroke victory in the Newport Cup seniors tournament at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island. Ziegler, 51, fired a final-round five-under-par 67, and his 17-under 199 broke the 54-hole tournament record by one stroke. Ziegler had not won a PGA event since the New Orleans Open in 1976. Tom Shaw and Jim Dent each shot 71 and George Archer had a 68 to tie for second at 11-under 205. Ziegler, who joined the Senior Tour in 1989, began the final round with a two-stroke lead over Shaw and Dent. (AP) Verwey Wins on Final Putt: Bobby Verwey of South Africa sank a 6-foot par putt on the final hole to win the British Seniors Open in St. Anne's, England. Verwey drove into a fairway bunker on the last hole, but recovered for the par that gave him a one-stroke victory over Bob Charles and Tommy Horton. Verwey, the brother-in-law of Gary Player, shot a 70 in the final round for a 285 total. Player won the tournament last year. (AP) TENNIS From Ashe to Shelton Bryan Shelton won a tournament for the first time in his career yesterday, beating Javier Frana, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of the Hall of Fame Championships in Newport, R.I. Shelton, 25, became the first black American to win a singles tournament in North America since Arthur Ashe won in Los Angeles in 1978. He is ranked 147th in the world. Shelton took control by breaking the Argentine's serve in the first game of the final set. At 30-30, Shelton floated a return that caught the baseline to reach break point. He sent a forehand winner past Frana for the service break. Frana never threatened to break serve for the remainder of the match. (AP) Gustafsson Prevails: Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden routed Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 6-1, 6-2, yesterday to win the Swedish Open in Bastad. It was the second Association of Tennis Professionals tour title for the 24-year-old Swede, who won another clay-court tournament two months ago in Munich, Germany. Gustafsson, the second-seeded player, used his powerful forehand to overwhelm the eighth-seeded Mancini. After the players split the first two games of the match, Gustafsson won nine straight games to win the first set and take a 4-0 lead in the second set. Mancini, who beat Aleksandr Volkov in the semifinals after losing the first eight games, couldn't come back this time. Gustafsson, the first Swede to win the tournament since 1987, earned $32,400. Mancini, who beat Gustafsson in the third round of the French Open, received $19,000. (AP) Sanchez Wins Swiss Open: Emilio Sanchez of Spain defeated his Davis Cup teammate Sergi Bruguera, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 in Gstaad to win the Swiss Open. The top-seeded Bruguera was bothered by a strained stomach muscle that hampered his service throughout the match. It was the 14th career title for Sanchez, who also won the Swiss Open in 1987. It was Bruguera's first tournament since he hurt his back at the French Open in May. (AP) Pierce Wins Her First: Mary Pierce, ranked 91st in the world, upset Sandra Cecchini of Italy, 6-0, 6-3, to win a clay-court tournament in Palermo, Sicily. It was the first career title for Pierce, a 16-year-old who was born in Canada and lives in France. Cecchini, ranked 16th in the world, couldn't keep up with the aggressive play of her opponent. (AP) AUTO RACING Mansell Roars Again Nigel Mansell sped away from the field yesterday to win the British Grand Prix by 42 seconds over Gerhard Berger for his second Formula One victory in eight days. Mansell, who won the French Grand Prix a week earlier, led for all but the opening 45 seconds. No other car could match the speed of his Williams-Renault, which repeatedly set lap records at Silverstone, England. The Briton, who has won his nation's grand prix three times in the last six years, began from the pole position but was overtaken at the start by defending world champion Ayrton Senna. Mansell needed only half a lap to regain the lead, and he never relinquished it after that, increasing his gap over Senna with nearly every lap. (AP)",1991-07-15T05:00:00+0000

Some material for the biography came from the subject's psychiatrist, Dr. Martin T. Orne, who gave the author, Diane Wood Middlebrook, medical records, unpublished early works and more than 300 audiotapes of their psychiatric sessions. The book charts Sexton's madness, extramarital affairs, alcoholism and sexual abuse of her daughter, but it is Dr. Orne's action that has provoked the sharpest outcry, particularly among psychiatrists, who see it as a breach of medical ethics. He acted with the permission of Sexton's literary executor, her daughter Linda Gray Sexton; and the Sexton children and friends have said the poet would have agreed.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to attend the ceremonies honoring Frederick the Great and his father, Frederick Wilhelm I, whose remains will be reburied at their summer palace in Potsdam, southwest of Berlin, after being interned for safety reasons in the south during World War II. The reburial, arranged mostly by the Hohenzollern family, will probably attract tens of thousands of onlookers. The kings, who ruled from 1713 to 1786, are remembered for their militarism; their iron cross and eagle was later adopted by the Nazis.

The settlement arose from a lawsuit filed in 1978, the year an amendment to the Civil Rights Act clarified the rights of pregnant women.

The image is the subject of GREEN MAN: The Archetype of Our Oneness With the Earth (HarperCollins, Cloth, $27.95; Paper, $14.95), written by the poet William Anderson and abundantly and beautifully illustrated by the photographer Clive Hicks. The book traces the evolution of the image of the Green Man through mythology, religion, art and architecture, dwelling particularly on its incorporation into Christian symbolism. Osiris, Dionysus, the illuminated Book of Kells, Martin Luther, Robin Hood and the contemporary Gaia hypothesis all figure in Mr. Anderson's complicated, though clearly presented, discussion. A prominent theme of the book is the connection between the artistic and architectural use of the Green Man, which has fluctuated over the centuries, and contemporary awareness and treatment of the natural world. Not surprisingly, the theme becomes ponderous at times, especially in the last chapter, where the author calls for a return of veneration for nature through its symbol, the Green Man.

So, as Canadian citizens may, Mr. Kealey pursued the case as a private prosecution, and recently he caught the ear of a local justice of the peace. Mr. Kealey charged that the bribe solicitation was part of a larger scheme that involved high government officials and was covered up by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

At the Frick, as almost nowhere else, paintings, sculpture, bronzes, porcelains, silver and period furniture are displayed intimately in spaces for living, with no ropes or glass.

The tape, made by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, reflects light hitting it at angles up to almost 90 degrees, which makes the trucks visible to vehicles viewing it from unusual angles (lower photo, above). Federal statistics show that there are more than 1,000 fatal accidents a year involving cars hitting the back or side of trucks, 70 percent of them at night. Often the cars drive under the trailers. Industry executives say trailers are most likely to be struck when a truck is making a U-turn, re-entering a highway or turning left at the end of a highway exit ramp.

But you shouldn't laugh. The monuments shown here commemorate, for the most part, such traditional American values as pride in work and worldly achievement or devotion to God, country or family. Consider the memorial to the twin sailors, buried at sea, who died in 1945 at the age of 20, or the angel-topped tomb with the photograph of a very young man in uniform and the inscription ""Daddy / Our Beloved Father / He Was Too Perfect to Live."" The grave of a biker who died in 1977 in Vietnam, which includes the motto ""God Forgives, Outlaws Don't,"" is decorated with fraternal graffiti and empty whisky bottles. Most touching are the simpler grave sites. Many, particularly those in the poorer parts of the Southwest, are marked with sun-bleached wooden crosses and adorned with homemade wreaths and plaster statues of Jesus.

So far, the Bonn Government has said no. Since 1989, and the first signs of reunification, officials and Western diplomats have reported misgivings in the West German intelligence community over the prospect of prosecuting such high-ranking spies, given that Western espionage agencies engage in the same activity.

Mr. Dahmer, a 31-year-old convicted child molester, subsequently admitted that he had killed 17 people over the last 10 years or so, the authorities said. The investigation of Mr. Dahmer led police to begin an anguished inquiry into their own procedures when it was learned that one victim was a 14-year-old boy who had escaped, naked and bleeding, from the apartment last May. Passing police intervened, but allowed the man to take the youth back to his apartment after Mr. Dahmer convinced them that the boy was 19 and his lover. The youth was in fact the brother of a boy that Mr. Dahmer had been convicted of molesting in 1989. Mr. Dahmer's lawyer described him as ""a very sick young man.""",1991-07-28T05:00:00+0000

As the crowd chanted ""Ole! Ole!"" Sanchez Vicario and Martinez rallied to defeat Gigi Fernandez and Zina Garrison, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1. The teams had split the singles matches, with Jennifer Capriati defeating Martinez, 4-6, 7-6, 6-1, and Sanchez Vicario winning, 6-3, 6-4, over Mary Joe Fernandez. The Americans became so frustrated in the final match that Gigi Fernandez, ranked No. 1 in the world in doubles, smashed a ball out of the stadium -- earning a warning from the umpire -- after missing two volleys in the last game. Martinez finished off the victory with a volley winner between the American players, then Sanchez Vicario and Martinez threw their racquets in the air and rushed to hug each other. Spain, which lost in the 1989 Federation Cup final to the United States, prevented the Americans from winning their third consecutive title. The United States still has a record 14 Federation Cup titles. Sanchez Vicario put on a heroic performance for Spain, overpowering Mary Joe Fernandez in the singles and then taking control in the doubles. Sanchez Vicario was all over the court in the doubles match, smashing winners and exhorting Martnez, an inexperienced doubles player.

Sixth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat held off Kathy Rinaldi, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, and seventh-seeded Barbara Paulus topped Christina Papadaki, 6-2, 6-3, in other matches. In a late match, Pam Shriver was scheduled to play Jo Durie for a berth opposite top-ranked Monica Seles in the second round tonight. Seles drew a first-round bye. Minter, ranked 50th in the world, broke a 3-3 tie in the first set when she became the first player in the match to hold service. She then clinched the set by taking 8 of the next 10 points, winning each on an error by Gildemeister. Minter moved ahead, 2-0, in the second set, completing her string of six straight winning games, and then held steady for her first victory in five career matches against Gildemeister, the 22d-ranked native of Peru. Rinaldi tied Tauziat, 4-4, in the third set with a service break and took the first two points in the next game with a pair of slams but couldn't maintain control. Tauziat went back ahead by winning the next four points, clinching the game on a strong backhand shot down the line for a 5-4 advantage. In the second set, Tauziat couldn't recover after Rinaldi won the first three games. Rinaldi dropped only one point during that span as she began to approach the net with greater frequency. Paulus, an Austrian who is ranked 16th, had little trouble beating Papadaki, a wild-card entry from Greece. (AP)",1991-07-30T05:00:00+0000
