It was the era before proliferating barriers and checkpoints and Arab satellite stations. Palestinians watched Israeli television and understood Hebrew. If a Palestinian workers son was getting married, he might well invite an Israeli colleague or boss  and that Israeli might well attend. The relationships were in some sense colonial, hardly between equals. But they were real. Each side was forced to face the fact that on the other were human beings with legitimate concerns, not merely enemies to be feared and despised.

Rebranding himself as Eric Kennedy, he invents a personal history (in which he was born and raised in a small town not far from Hyannis Port) that does much more than get him into Camp Ossipee.

Lacking the tight construction of a short story or the narrative arc of a novel or memoir, such essays have given readers pleasure without winning cultural respect. Written in a minor key, they could be slight and superficial, but their drawbacks could also be strengths. The style of the first-person essay tends to be conversational, tentative  in tune with our postmodern skepticism about absolutes, the trust we place in multiple perspectives. Few writers have pursued this more resourcefully than Phillip Lopate, who started out as a novelist and poet but gained traction when he began writing lively first-person essays in the late 1970s, later editing a landmark anthology, The Art of the Personal Essay (1994).

They said that he had been treated for a behavioral disorder that caused him to injure himself and that the bruising that had been found on his body was consistent with the kind of self-injury associated with the disorder. The boys adoptive mother, Laura Shatto, told investigators that she had left Max and his brother playing outside unattended and returned to find Max lying on the ground, unresponsive. He died later that day at a hospital. The United States Embassy in Moscow called the boys death a tragedy, but added that Texas officials worked diligently and professionally to examine the evidence concerning Maxs death.

N.M.L. Capital, a subsidiary of the New York-based hedge fund Elliott Management, is leading a lawsuit among bondholders who refused Argentinas 2005 and 2010 debt swaps. Ninety-three percent of creditors agreed to the restructuring in which debt stemming from Argentinas $100 billion default was exchanged for new issues at 35 cents on the dollar. A judge ruled last fall in favor of creditors, saying that Argentina could not service only some of its debt, and that it had the financial wherewithal to pay in full. Speaking to Congress on Friday, President Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner said Argentina would pay these vulture funds but only according to the same terms and conditions agreed upon for the other creditors. A spokesman for Elliott Management declined to comment. ",2013-03-02T03:25:48+0000

A stressor, she explains, is a sudden change in circumstances or environment that interacts with a complicated psychological profile in a way that leads a previously quiescent person to become violent. The stressor is never the only explanation for the crime, but it is inevitably an important factor in a complex set of variables that lead to a disaster. The Arab Spring and Climate Change doesnt claim that climate change caused the recent wave of Arab revolutions, but, taken together, the essays make a strong case that the interplay between climate change, food prices (particularly wheat) and politics is a hidden stressor that helped to fuel the revolutions and will continue to make consolidating them into stable democracies much more difficult.",2013-03-02T18:06:05+0000

(History) THE BIBLE Mark Burnett, the reality television impresario, and his wife, the actress Roma Downey, tackle great biblical moments in this 10-hour mini-series, which Neil Genzlinger, writing in The New York Times, called a rickety, often cheesy spectacle that is calculated to play well to a certain segment of the already enlisted choir but risks being ignored or scorned in other quarters. Ms. Downey leads the cast, which also includes Diogo Morgaldo as Jesus, above center, being baptized by John (Daniel Percival). Alas, Abraham, Moses, David, Daniel and the other great biblical figures arent really developed in a way that illuminates them or makes them linger in our minds, Mr. Genzlinger said. And those thinking that the ancient miracles might be better served by the special effects available in 2013 than they have been in previous versions should prepare for disappointment. The Red Sea parts no more convincingly here than it did for Charlton Heston in 1956. (All-Star Celebrity Apprentice, of which Mr. Burnett is an executive producer, has its season premiere on NBC at 9.) Vikings, making its premiere at 10, fares somewhat better in Mr. Genzlingers opinion. It is a mini-series about a band of professional pillagers with a disregard for human life and a relentless focus on gratifying material desires, he wrote. So it is somewhat surprising that it is also a refreshing study in restraint. Created by Michael Hirst, whose previous projects include Camelot, on Starz, and The Tudors, on Showtime, it has the same relatively high production values, and sometimes the cinematography is downright arresting, he said. But what really drives the series are the performances; he cited in particular Travis Fimmel, Gabriel Byrne and Gustaf Skarsgard.",2013-03-03T20:08:35+0000

A Mauritanian news Web site, Sahara Media, which has close contacts with Abu Zeids group, cited an Islamist source as confirming that he had been killed in a French airstrike. But the same unnamed Islamist source denied reports of the death of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, another militant leader, who Chads military said had been killed by its soldiers in Mali last week. The source claimed that Mr. Belmokhtar was alive and operating to the southwest, close to the Malian town of Gao. Frances chief of the defense staff, Adm. douard Guillaud, told Europe 1 radio Monday morning that it was probable that Abu Zeid had been killed. It is likely, but only likely, he said. We dont have any certainty for the moment. It would be good news. Abu Zeid is said to have abducted more than 20 Western hostages since 2008 for ransom, some of which went to Al Qaeda. He is believed to have killed a British hostage, Edwin Dyer, in 2009, and a 78-year-old Frenchman, Michel Germaneau, in 2010. ",2013-03-05T01:51:54+0000

(Sundance) THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2010) Michael Nyqvist stars as a crusading Swedish journalist hired by a wealthy industrialist (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate the disappearance of his niece 40 years earlier. Noomi Rapace, above with Mr. Nyqvist, is Lisbeth Salander, the vulnerable yet ruthlessly competent computer hacker who helps him solve the mystery in this original Swedish film adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel, directed by Niels Arden Oplev. Though Ms. Rapace is a fine professional scowler, with cheekbones that thrust like knives and a pout thats mostly pucker, she tends to register as an intriguing idea instead of a thoroughly realized character, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She more or less looks the part that the filmmakers dont let her fully play. Ms. Dargis added: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was originally published as Men Who Hate Women, which apparently wasnt sexy enough for English-language bookshelves. The title change certainly spices things up, no matter how commonplace body art is, at least outside of Stockholm, and it plays down its overarching theme, which the movie only does further. Just as significant is the substitution in the title of girl for women, a categorical displacement (and diminution) that also shifts the emphasis from the crime (and criminals) and places it on Salanders slender back. Its an attractive back in the movie, as is the tattoo adorning it, even if, like all the prettily photographed winter landscapes, the dragon covers up something the filmmakers seem loath to reveal and simultaneously eager to exploit.",2013-03-05T06:00:14+0000

Mr. Sarkozy, 58, who narrowly lost his attempt at re-election in May, said that politics bores him to death, but that sadly, there may come a moment when the question is no longer, Do you want to? but, Do you have a choice? He predicted a social crisis and a financial crisis of an uncommon violence. Mr. Sarkozys comments were greeted with pleasure by his supporters and derision by his critics. ",2013-03-07T02:54:38+0000

us,The Terror Loophole,"The law that requires background checks on gun buyers is full of loopholes, some big and some small, but the most egregious loophole of all may be the fact that people on the F.B.I.s terrorist watch list are legally entitled to buy firearms and explosives. And they have been doing so at an alarming rate. Between February 2004 and December 2010, individuals whose names turned up on the list were cleared to purchase firearms or explosives a total of 1,321 times, according to the General Accounting Office. Felons, illegal immigrants and mentally ill applicants are barred on the obvious grounds that they could present a heightened risk of violence. Not so, terrorist suspects  an anomaly that congress has occasionally tsk-tsked over since the 9/11 atrocities, but done nothing substantial to repair.Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has reintroduced a worthy measure to close this terror gap eight years after his initial attempt failed. It would give the Attorney General authority to stop a firearm or explosive sale when a background check reveals the buyer is a known or suspected terrorist who the Attorney General reasonably believes may be planning mayhem. The National Rifle Association opposed the measure in the past because the terrorist watch list has been shown to contain errors. Thats hardly a justification for extending carte blanche to terrorist suspects. Besides, the Lautenberg bill includes written guidelines and due process safeguards that would permit individuals to challenge denials. Theres really no good reason for inaction, unless of course fear of the gun lobby counts as an excuse.",2013-03-07T16:50:49+0000

We all played the songs in the studio together, Cumming said of the band. You can really hear our instruments bleeding over each other. The organic quality here lies in considerable contrast to the Virgins self-titled 2008 debut, whose rock n roll was produced to within inches of bubble-gum pop on tracks like Rich Girls and One Week of Danger. Their new material is stripped down, a harmonic rumble of moonlight swagger and blue-rose tattoos. I never aspired to hear someone sing my lyrics on American Idol,' Cumming explained. I just wanted to make music that felt authentic to me. Indeed, a lot has changed in the intervening five years: Cumming is the only original member left in the group; hes married now, to the artist Aurel Schmidt; and he even taught himself to play the piano (think Schroeder from Peanuts, but with a Brechtian twist).

When the Book Review returned on April 7 of that year, its front cover featured a cartoon of a despondent bearded man slumped in an armchair, his concerned wife soothing him: Cheer up, Harry. Youre not the only author who came out during the strike. And he wasnt: the first quarter of 1963 saw the arrival of big books from Gnter Grass (The Tin Drum), Betty Friedan (The Feminine Mystique), Anthony Burgess (A Clockwork Orange) and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich), among many others. The Book Review did what it could to catch up  all four of those books received respectful reviews in the April 7 issue, and both The Tin Drum and The Feminine Mystique went on to become hardcover best sellers. But Burgess and Solzhenitsyn had to defer their gratification. A Clockwork Orange finally turned up on the paperback fiction list in 1972, after Stanley Kubrick had turned it into a hit movie.

Ford, though, possesses an underlying conviction about continuity  of character, of place, of history  while in Kennedys world everything is up for grabs, all the time. One might view her work as surreal, if that didnt imply a divorce from our own felt reality; one might call her sensibility ironic, except shes profoundly attached to what she describes. Kennedys novels repeatedly take on dark subjects (alcoholism, familial despair, sexual betrayal, loneliness), but they do so in a chatty, engaging manner that can sometimes make you laugh out loud. I wasnt surprised to learn that she has a sideline as a stand-up comic  though, again, this isnt something a serious American novelist would do. And A. L.

Over the last several years, the event has catapulted small beer brewers like 32 Via dei Birrai into stardom. Buyers and foodies alike descend to see where the culinary barometer is tilting. The fair includes on-site chats and presentations, like this years colloquium about grandiose cake design led by the expert pastry chef Roberto Rinaldini of the famed Pasticceria Rinaldini di Rimini, and discussions about how to encourage your childs inner foodie presented by Vogue Bambini. The event is held in Florences impressive Leopolda train station, but there are more than 100 supplementary food events all over the city at hotels, restaurants and cultural sites like the Gucci museum, where the house chef will be teaching the secrets of cookie-making.

The ruling Friday, by Judge A. Wallace Tashima of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, came in a lawsuit brought by teachers and students at the Tucson Unified School District against Arizonas school superintendent, John Huppenthal, and other state officials. The plaintiffs say the law is too broad to be constitutional. The law, signed in 2010, prohibits public schools from offering courses that promote the overthrow of the United States government, advocate ethnic solidarity and foster resentment toward a race or class of people. In Tucson, students studied history and literature from a Mexican-American perspective. Opponents said the curriculum encouraged students to resent white people. Judge Tashima ruled, however, that banning classes tailored specifically to students of a particular ethnicity is unconstitutional. ",2013-03-12T00:35:19+0000

Force to Replace French-Led Coalition," France has told fellow United Nations Security Council members it intends to introduce a resolution this month that would authorize a peacekeeping force in Mali to replace the current contingents of African and French soldiers deployed in that country, diplomats said Tuesday. France, which has said publicly it wants to scale down its forces in Mali, plans to schedule a vote on such a resolution in April, with the goal of transferring peacekeeping responsibilities by July, the diplomats said. French forces intervened two months ago in Mali, a former French colony, to stop Islamist militants occupying the northern part of the country from expanding into the south. Since then, a combination of soldiers from France, Mali and neighboring African countries has helped drive the militants out of northern Malian cities deep into the hinterlands, but they remain a threat. The exact size of a United Nations peacekeeping force for Mali has yet to be determined, but Frances foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, was quoted by Agence France-Presse as telling lawmakers in Paris it could be as many as 10,000 soldiers.

The clubs where most gigs take place are too small and the stages are too low for that; audience members are close enough to see musicians eye to eye. They can probably run into them backstage, too, loading their own equipment into the van. Even at larger places, the stars dont get to bring their custom-built stages, lights and sound systems; they play in the existing setups, like the big, bumpy backyard of a barbecue place or a generic temporary stage in a warehouse or a vacant lot. Performers also experience the same Texas weather  summery even in March  that audiences do.

The future arrived a little while ago, he posits  maybe with Y2K, maybe with Sept. 11. Now its here. And we are stuck with a diminishment of everything that isnt happening right now  and the onslaught of everything that supposedly is. Mr. Toffler warned that we would be unready for this onslaught. Mr. Rushkoff is more analytical than alarmist. He divides his thoughts into five sections addressing five kinds of profound change, and his biggest illustration of present shock has to do with the actual book itself. Because the present is more full of interruptions than the past was, it took him extra time to write. Because its ideas arent glib, he says, here I am writing opera when the people are listening to singles. And he realizes that data-swamped readers may take longer to finish books now.

The musicians contract expired in November but was extended to February when, by mutual agreement, the musicians continued talking and playing. On Wednesday the union rejected the administrations latest proposal for a three-year contract that, according to the administration, would have kept the musicians among the three highest-paid orchestras in the country (the others being the Chicago Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic). The current average salary of the musicians is $165,000, the administration said. In addition to higher salaries, the musicians are seeking increases in benefits and pension contributions. A spokesman for the players could not immediately be reached. The administration said it had already notified the players that it would present a revised proposal on Thursday.

His age would suggest a kind of caretaker pope, but his name (evoking not only Francis of Assisi but the great Jesuit Francis Xavier as well) suggests a mix of humility and purifying zeal; his rich biography, meanwhile, offers enough material for multiple narratives, multiple hopes, and (of course) multiple lines of attack from the churchs many critics.",2013-03-13T22:13:18+0000

Tourism  which has accounted for 11 percent of Egypts gross domestic product, economists say  has suffered more than any other industry from the street protests and political turmoil that have prevailed since the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak two years ago. The report, released by the nonprofit World Economic Forum and publicized around the world, is unlikely to help. A Tourism Ministry official said the results were not a surprise, given the turmoil and the surveys methodology, which relied heavily on a survey of executives as well as statistics like traffic accidents. Both government and industry officials say, however, that there are signs of recovery, although mainly because of bargain-hunting Red Sea beachgoers, rather than the more profitable Sphinx-and-Pyramids circuit.

Under an American sanctions law provision that took effect on Feb. 6, any country that buys Iranian oil must put the purchase money into a local bank account.

But if there is one reason visitors return again and again to Bangkok, it is the people. The anonymity and daily grind of urban life is slowly wearing away at the legendary Thai smile.

Robert Bentley signed a law on Thursday granting tax credits to families who want to send their children to private schools or better-performing public schools. The act was passed amid heated controversy, not only about its substance, but about the way it was passed: A conference committee that was to reconcile versions of a school-related bill already passed by the House and Senate added the tax credit, and more than tripled the original bills length. The new version was then voted on quickly by both houses. Republican leaders said the maneuver was necessary for passage, but Democrats were left fuming. A circuit court initially blocked the bill from going forward out of the House, but the State Supreme Court lifted that hold on Wednesday. The legal fight is far from over, however, and even now at least one Republican legislator has raised questions about the bills passage. ",2013-03-15T00:17:57+0000

For while the e-revolution means changes in how we read any sort of book, the move from epistles to e-pistles is, for better or worse, a fundamental redefinition of the genre itself. And while there are probably plenty of contemporary writers saving up their best e-mails on external hard drives for later publication, its difficult to imagine those looking or acting like a volume of letters.

In the late 60s, during a 14-month stint as a film critic for The New York Times, she eviscerated a good deal of what Hollywood had to offer. (Her loathing for John Waynes hyper-patriotic Green Berets  so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail  was entered into the Congressional Record by Strom Thurmond, who cited it as definitive proof that this must be one of the most admirable movies of our generation.) In 1980, she wrote an 8,000-word essay in The New York Review of Books that denounced the work of Pauline Kael as piece by piece, line by line, and without interruption, worthless. Throughout it all, she was a writer for The New Yorker, and her memoir of nearly 30 years there was similarly unsparing, showing that her category of old friend wasnt necessarily distinct from that of fair game.

She also struck down a statute on legal challenges by recipients of the security letters, but stayed her ruling to allow the government to appeal. ",2013-03-16T00:13:51+0000

(HBO) THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (2012) Seven financially distressed British retirees (Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith) are lured by invitation to outsource themselves for a stay at what is billed as a luxurious retreat for the elderly and beautiful in Jaipur, India, in this film directed by John Madden. But upon arrival, they discover that the place is far from what was advertised by their host (Dev Patel, above right with Tena Desae), a wildly disorganized but enthusiastic young man who neglected to mention the lack of working telephones and doors on the rooms.

Although its not as tidy or comfy as that self-congratulating fantasy of British noblesse oblige or as elevated as the Merchant-Ivory films set in India, itll do nicely.

Last month, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice, Joan Orie Melvin, was convicted on campaign corruption charges.

One of the most contentious issues was whether ammunition should be included in the scope of the treaty. Anna McDonald, a representative of Oxfam, which is pushing for strong treaty, said her group wanted strict and specific language that would regulate ammunition.

In addition to supplying great books, the store became a go-to destination for royalty-free images pulled from Victorian-era womens magazines or 19th-century garden manuals that artists could incorporate into their work. For those who considered the shop a trove of ready-made inspiration, the news that it will close at the end of the month comes as a huge shock. The Charing Cross Road area of London has changed from a haven for small shops to an area for mainstream brands and fashion, the stores manager Tim Matthews wrote in an e-mail. Beyond that, though, image resources are increasingly found online and Dover Publications are moving steadily into that world. Among the brilliant, obscure volumes that made up the shops stock in trade were Gustave Dors illustrations of London; Jan Vredeman De Vriess book of 16th-century architectural engravings, Studies in Perspective; and Jim Harners collection of 1,000 black-and-white animal drawings.",2013-03-21T19:00:25+0000

She called it Mountains and Sea, and it became her best-known, most influential work. Its bounding scale, skirmish of pastel colors and charcoal lines, and mixture of landscape, still life and abstraction were distinctive. But most important was the way it fused color and canvas into a new, streamlined unity.

Not surprisingly, a lot of the discussion focused on the impact of this trend on children, because the story of late marriage is entangled with the story of rising out-of-wedlock births, thanks to what the authors call the great crossover the fact that the age of first marriage,which was once about a year earlier than the average age at which the first child was born, now lags the average age of first birth by about a year. Hence the reports most attention-grabbing statistic:That 48 percent of overall first births, and 58 percent of first births to what the report calls Middle Americans women with a high school diploma and maybe some college, but no 4-year degree now take place outside of marriage,a trendwhose negative consequences for childrenprobablydont need to be rehearsed here.",2013-03-22T12:48:28+0000

One sign that the book has touched a nerve is that, along with a steady stream of praise, it is also fielding criticism from across the ideological spectrum. On the one hand, in the biology is destiny camp, Christina Hoff Sommers recently charged in The Atlantic that Sandberg was mired in 1970s-style feminism with her earnest calls for consciousness-raising groups and her desire to liberate her fellow Americans from the stereotypes of gender.

When do we stand aside, and when do we act?

Gavins characters, most of whom live in down-at-the-heels neighborhoods of Los Angeles or in modest industrial towns south of the city, are sons of journeymen, low-paid assistants and traveling salesmen. These men know, or are beginning to suspect, that the mark they will make on the world is small. But Middle Men doesnt wallow in pessimism; with deft portraiture, nimble prose and an intimacy with the lives of his amiable characters, Gavin shows us that the real work of a life takes place not when the sale is made but when the salesman goes back home, looks in a half-empty refrigerator and considers his options.",2013-03-22T15:13:18+0000

Her vocal stamina was considerably diminished by the time she filmed the movie, but her disciplined, slightly hoarse rendition of that gospel standard gives Sparkle much of its heart.

(HBO) PHIL SPECTOR (2013) A wigged-out Al Pacino reunites with the writer and director David Mamet(Glengarry Glen Ross) to portray the music producer and songwriter charged with the 2003 shooting death of Lana Clarkson inside his home in Alhambra, Calif. Helen Mirren, right with Mr. Pacino, plays the lawyer Linda Kenney Baden, who represented Mr. Spector alongside Bruce Cutler (Jeffrey Tambor) at his first trial, in 2007, which resulted in a hung jury. (He was convicted in 2009 and is serving 19 years to life.) The movie has already set off controversy: Mr. Spectors wife, Rachelle, has complained about the films depiction of her husband as a foul-mouthed megalomaniac. Edward Lozzi, a former publicist for Ms. Clarkson, has taken exception to the films focus on the defenses argument that she killed herself. The film is a work of fiction, Mr. Mamet said in an HBO interview, spun from his fascination with Mr. Spectors character and the mythological possibilities. The focus on the tender and respectful bond between lawyer and client looks a lot like a revisionist re-enactment and maybe even absolution, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times.

Saint Laurent, then the newly appointed Dior heir, went on to use Abraham silk throughout his career; his last couture collection, in 2002, was the firms death knell. Faced with a dwindling market for its ultra-upscale fabrics, it closed its doors and donated its meticulous archive to the Swiss National Museum.

So of course, Jennifer Mascia and I looked into it.Guess what?It doesnt appear to be true, as Slate reported in February.

Thats fewer than half of the F.B.I.s reported 8,583 gun homicides in 2011. Guns killed more than 17 times more people than hammers and are responsible for nearly 70 percent of total murders.

The two, Mico Stanisic and Stojan Zuplanin, were each handed a 22-year prison sentence. The verdicts underscored the crucial roles played by the police and armed militia in the notorious persecution of Croats and Muslims, many of whom were beaten, tortured, raped or otherwise abused in as many as 50 wartime detention centers run by Bosnian Serbs. The judges said that many civilians were killed or died from hunger, illness and mistreatment during the campaign to create zones for Serbs only in Bosnia. ",2013-03-28T01:33:42+0000

The radio in my car was tuned to an NPR show, on which callers were debating the decision by the C.E.O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, to ban employees from working from home. Id been thinking about Mayer since early that morning, having fallen down an Internet rabbit hole that plunged me deep into her art collection, her exclusive wardrobe and her estimated $300 million net worth. Specifically, I was thinking about the rather highhanded, Marie Antoinette-ish way in which she dismissed the need for extended maternity leave, as if it hadnt occurred to her that building an en suite nursery for her newborn next to her office basically elided the need for it, since the baby could remain within a few feet of her all day long.",2013-03-29T14:41:11+0000

But on a Sunday night at a tiny club in Lower Manhattan, something was happening. There were four acts on the bill at the Mercury Lounge; the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the openers, and it was still light out when they took the stage. The band was elemental: guitar and drums, no bass. But the singer, who called herself Karen O, was otherworldly. She was dressed in a kind of Clockwork Orange burlesque, with cutout hearts as pasties. Before the show, she doused herself in olive oil. Onstage, she danced around like a lunatic, manically grinning and flinging droplets of oil from her hair into the crowd. The guitar player, Nick Zinner, had seen this side of her. But the drummer, Brian Chase, had practiced with the band only once, and this was their first gig. The only thing to do, Chase remembers thinking, is just be like, Whoa. ",2013-03-29T14:41:23+0000
