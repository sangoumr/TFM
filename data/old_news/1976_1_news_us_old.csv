us,Lina Wertmuller's Comedy of Foibles,"It is late at night in the Milan tenement. Adelina, a pretty, conventional country girl newly moved to the city and quickly urbanized, finds herself fighting off the advances of her Sicilian fianc, Carletto. Carletto wants to marry Adelina but she thinks they should wait. After all, she has told him on more than one occasion, they haven't enough money for all those things he doesn't even know they need yet, like plastic flowers.On this particular night, Carletto, a good sort really, has let his passion overcome his patience. He attacks. Frontally. They wrestle. He tugs at her bodystocking. She cries and kicks. He gets hopelessly tangled in underclothes. Finally they topple over in such a way that Adelina must decide  very quicklywhether to save her virginity or her new TV set.It's a crucial, hilarious moment, and one that is integral to the kind of social-political-sexual comedies that Lina Wertmuller, the brilliant Italian director, seems to have a corner on these days.The scene is from ""All Screwed Up,"" Miss Wertmuller's 1973 comedy that opened yesterday at the Eastside Cinema. ""All Screwed Up,"" a witlessly slangy reworking of the Italian title (which is literally translated as ""All in Order, Nothing in Place""), was made just after ""Love and Anarchy"" and just before ""Swept Away.""In many details it seems less polished, less cohesive than either of those two films, but that may simply be because its narrative scope is broader and its concerns less delicately expressed. It's a noisy, angry, relentlessly paced comedy that leaves one exhausted. Miss Wertmuller is a risk-taker, which creates a certain amount of tension in the audience. Will she or won't she pull it off?She sometimes underscores her points in blunt ways that would be avoided by a director more conscious  or more fearfulof the refinements of film criticism. She appears to be saying to hell with all that, as long as the point is effectively made. Watching ""All Screwed Up"" is to be witness to a giant talent that won't be cut down to size by apprehensions of whether or not something is in good taste.""All Screwed Up"" is the often exuberantly funny tale about the often tragic adventures of a group of young country people who have come to Milan to make their fortunes. In addition to Adelina and Carletto there are Gigi, who drifts into a life of small crime (he becomes the sort of burglar who neatly folds the shirts as he ransacks a bureau drawer), Isotta, who becomes a street walker, and Sante and Mariuccia, who marry in bliss and, in two years, are something less than blessed with seven children (one set of twins followed by quintuplets).Though the characters in the forefront are fully realized, Miss Wertmuller's fundamental interest is obviously in the society they inhabit, in the endless and usually fruitless pursuit of work and money and appliances. The film is not a polemic, however. It recognizes that there are no easy answers to social, political and sexual questions. Instead the film is fascinated and amazed that, given the odds against them, these people manage to survive at all.""All Screwed Up"" juxtaposes contradictory scenes with occasionally breathtaking effect, as when Miss Wertmuller cuts from the silly, self-absorbed conversation of two young women to what amounts to a ballet by the workers in a slaughter-house as they skin and grade sides of beef.At her best, Miss Wertmuller combines these contradictory effects in a single scene: the beggars outside a butcher shop, when told they are disturbing the customers, answer logically that the meat is disturbing them. It is both too funny and too harsh. Sometimes the hysteria of the characters  so broadly acted they resist easy criticismappears to envelop the film itself, but that, too, is part of the fascination of the film and what the director is up to.There's no doubt about it now: Lina Wertmuller has become one of the major film talents of our day.",1976-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Probably the makers of ""Old Dracula"" care about the machinery, since they don't give us much else.We do have David Niven as Count Dracula, proprietor of an up-to-date horror castle into which tours are booked. Besides paying for the castle's upkeep, the tourists are examined in their sleep to see if any has a particularly rare blood type. Dracula's wife died 50 years earlier of anemia, and a transfusion would bring her back. As Mr. Niven explains, it's no fun going to bed each morning in an empty crypt, especially one equipped with a matrimonial double coffin.Does this seem funny? If so, ""Old Dracula"" will seem funny. If not, it will quickly turn tedious, although I liked the Mark Cross-style portable leather coffin that Dracula takes with him on his travels. It is hard not to have some affection for Mr. Niven: He is beginning to resemble a haunted house himself, but his lineaments remind us of better times even if his lines do not.",1976-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,'Maisie' and 'Sub Rosa' Shown at Whitney,"The Whitney Museum's new film program, Babette Mangolte's 58-minute ""What Maisie Knew"" and Michael Harvey's 12-minute ""Sub Rosa,"" are the sort of works designed to convince you that films are essentially a parasitic art.Miss Mangolte displays a lot of nerve by invoking Henry James's subtle scrupulously complex novel about a rotten world as seen through the eyes of a resilient little girl. If Miss Mangolte's Maisie is the camera, as the director pretends in her program notes, then this little girl is prematurely bent. She sees the world through the viewfinder of an especially dull, film-school student whose friends don't mind making idiots of themselves. The film has nothing to do with James and everything to do with someone wanting to make a film but having no dependably talented impulse.""Sub Rosa"" is a not unendurable rip-off of Matisse's ""Harmony in Red."" A female model, in a red dress and red hat, sits in a red room, while the camera slowly moves around her as she quotes some of the master's musings about color (""Do you suppose red has a particular taste?""). I won't give away the ending.",1976-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: French 'Slap':Daughter Grows Away From Her Father,"There are sparks of humor and style in this new French film, but they gutter out like short birthday candles in thick frosting.Like many weak movies whose virtues exist without redeeming them, ""The Slap"" starts out well. A study of an unquiet father and a daughter who is growing up and away from him, it quickly establishes its characters, their wry if unoriginal predicament and our interest in what happens to them. Unfortunately, nothing much does.The father is a professor, a man whose considerable fire is banked by a determined conformity. His wife has left him years before; he keeps a respectable mistress, plays vigorous soccer on weekends, and takes care of his 18-year-old daughter.Both father and daughter have the crises appropriate to their seasons. The father's repressed rebelliousness flares up when he sees a student beaten by two policemen. He scuffles with them, is arrested and threatened with disciplinary action by the education authorities, and submits his resignation.His daughter wants to leave home and move in with her boyfriend, is forbidden to, rebels, submits, fails her exams, runs off with a new boyfriend. As the film plods along, with endless coming and going and telephoning and arguing and changing of minds, the two crises gradually erode.The daughter's rebelliousness matures into real independence. The father's professional difficulties blow over, and by the end he has left his mistress and seems likely to take up again with his wife.The director, Claude Pinoteau, has chosen two strong actors for his protagonists. As the professor, Lino Ventura manages stiffness dourness and moments of sudden sweetness that illuminate his complexity. His sour love for his daughterhe shouts her to her room in one flare-up, and the next morning brings her a solicitous cup of coffee in bedis held firmly this side of sentimentality.As the gawky, quicksilver, funny, fidgety daughter, Isabelle Adjaniwho was the star of Franois Truffaut's ""Adle H.""also plays her part for what it is worth.Neither of the parts is worth a great deal, however. The characters are established, but they have remarkably little to do. About halfway through, the movie's slim vitality flickers out and never recovers. Mr. Pinoteau has set out pinwheels but failed to find a wind.",1976-01-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Self-Indulgence Is Triumphant in '92 in the Shade',"Thomas McGuane's ""92 in the Shade"" is subtle and lively. Parts of its are overbrilliant, if anything, in that they compel our pleasure almost to the point of distracting. By the time it ends, we have unmistakably been entertained. Perhaps we have been mildly poisoned, as well.Mr. McGuane, a novelist turned screen writer and director, has set his movie in the charter-boat, fishing-guide world of Key West, Fla. The blues and greens, the heat, the wilting paint hint at corruption. Under the film's humor and momentum there is also corruption. But the whole thing is so finely tuned, so edgily balanced that it's hard to say whether corruption is merely the theme or shades over into the viewpoint as well.The film, which opened yesterday at Showcase theaters, uses a disarrayed and drifting child of plenty as its protagonist. Peter Fonda plays him as a human desert planted with expensive flowers. He is self-indulgent and cold, disconnected and rich.His name is Tom Skelton. His grandfather owns the bank, the police force and a vast supply of earthness. His father has retreated semi-permanently into a kind of outdoor crib  shades of ""Baby Doll""set out on the front porch. Tom takes a candlelit bath with a braless schoolteacher and suddenly decides that he is going to find something to do.What he does is move his cloudy self-indulgence into a rough and real world, that of the boat captains who take tourists out fishing. They are hard, self-made men, at once competitive and clannish, and with no liking for a rich kid who tries to break into their business.It is in its portrayal of these men that the movie moves from languid wit into something stronger. There is Nicholas Dance, a violent, primitive man with a rough code of honor that consists, as he puts it, in maintaining his ""credence."" There is Carter, cleverer, and quicker to see the threat to his struggling lifestyle posed by Tom.Dance and Carter, in an act of half-playful, half-serious hazing, steal Tom's first client. Tom's detachment dissolves totally. He's never reacted to anything; now he overreacts viciously by burning Dance's boat.Dance, played with marvelous strength and a kind of baffled sweetness by Warren Oates, tries to puzzle out the rights and wrongs. Egged on by Carteranother splendid performance by Harry Dean Stantonhe decides that even though he likes Tom and has wronged him, the reprisal is out of all measure.To maintain his ""credence,"" he warns Tom, he will shoot him if he continues to work as a fishing guide. Tom ignores him. He gets money from his grandfather and orders a boat built that is far grander than anything Carter or Dance have been able to buy. He takes out a touristsent to him by Carter, who wants to see him deadand there is a showdown.The showdown is more ironic than tragic. Quite coldly, in fact, this pseudo flower-child has used the old weapons of money and positionhis grandfather'sto get his way. It is an ending with uneasy implications. Tom has been portrayed with charm as well as irony and there is an overwhelming desire not to see him shot dead. But it is he, fundamentally, who is the aggressor and the bully.As in ""Rancho DeLuxe,"" which he wrote, although he didn't direct it, Mr. McGuane captures the speech and style of young people who are funny and charming and empty and mean. ""92"" maintains some of the disquieting ambiguity of viewpoint that weakened ""Rancho."" But it's a more satisfying picture.The authenticity of Carter and Dance sets off the emptiness at the center of Tom, and gives us a focus to sense it. So does a line by Tom's invalid father who warns his son that, for Dance, the showdown is a matter of honor. ""It's a matter of who gets to fish and who gets to cut bait,"" says Tom, shrugging the notion off. ""You and your generation have a depraved sense of language,"" says his father.",1976-01-22T05:00:00+0000

Although the doctor and his wife threw out some of their old furniture and bought a few new pieces, they worked mostly with what they already had. The contemporary feeling in their fourbedroom apartment comes, for the most part, from changes to walls and doors and windows. Working with architect John Bedenkapp, the couple stripped off moldings and baseboards; changed doublehung, multipaned windows in the living and dining rooms to single sheets of glass in pivoting frames; and installed two sets of floortoceiling double doors in the living room. They also merged the old pantry and kitchen and put in new cabinets and appliances. Once these changes were made, the couple began arranging the furniture. In many cases. pieces that had lived in one place in the old apartment found different resting places in the new. For instance, the dining table was cut down and lacquered oxblood and is now a console table in the foyer. A Spanish tooled leather screen from the foyer became the headboard in the master bedroom. Dining chairs and a sofa for the living room were new purchases. As for color, the couple decided on melon orange for the walls in their living and dining rooms. It was close enough to the yellow of their old living room to keep them from having to reupholster their furniture.",1976-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Hedda on Film Is All Glenda Jackson,"When we first see Glenda Jackson's Hedda Gabler in the opening credit sequence of the new film, ""Hedda,"" she is standing on the deck of a Norwegian coastal steamer, her body straight and lean, her jaw firm and her eyes betraying no interest whatever. Hedda tolerates scenery. Fjords, mountains, autumn foliage are landscapes to be passed through as quickly as possible. That's all.Standing on the deck, she is the steamer's figurehead. She could slice through a polar icecap without receiving a scratch. It's a striking image, and one that sets the style for the bright, clean-edge performance that follows.""Hedda,"" which opened at the Fine Arts Theater yesterday, is Trevor Nunn's screen adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company stage production that he directed and toured in this country and Australia last year. It is very much a film, though, with a few exceptions at the beginning, it sticks to the single interior set of the Ibsen play.Not having seen the stage production, in which Miss Jackson's interpretation caused a certain amount of controversy, I have no idea to what extent that interpretation has been modified, if at all. Her screen performance could hardly be called controversial, though it is certainly lively andif you're like methank heaven for that. The pleasures of ""Hedda Gabler"" are not inexhaustible, especially when Hedda is played with the more conventional gestures of despair.Miss Jackson's Hedda comes on with low-key fury, her manner so abrasive and openly sarcastic that it's difficult to see why men have tried to conquer her, unless it was simply the game and not the prize that was fascinating. She is intelligent. She's well-born. She's also lethal, which is so apparent from the start of Miss Jackson's performance that the interest is not in why she wrecks the lives around her, but how. This version of ""Hedda Gabler"" is all Miss Jackson's Hedda and, I must say, great fun to watch, though I don't think that I was moved for a minute.Miss Jackson's technical virtuosity is particularly suited to a character like Hedda. Her command of her voice and her body, as well as the Jackson mannerisms, have the effect of separating the actress from the character in a very curious way. It's as if one were reviewing the other with rueful self-awareness. It's the drama critic in Hedda who describes as ""a grotesque farce"" her marriage to a dull pedant who doesn't come up to her ankles. Hedda is a terrific roleand Hedda knows it. She is willful, insatiable, articulate, but no more demanding of others than she is of herself.One of the problems with the film is that none of the actors seem to have the resources needed to balance Miss Jackson's performance. Some of this is in Ibsen's play, of course. It's no contest from the beginning, when Hedda and her husband return from their honeymoon and she sets about goading her former lover into ""a positive act"" (suicide) and sparring with her husband's best friend, who could possibly become a lover.Most effective is Timothy West, as the possible lover who is almost as ruthless as Hedda is. But both Peter Eyre, as her husband, and Patrick Stewart, as the former lover whose life and work she destroys, haven't the weight to make the contest with Miss Jackson especially interesting.In this ""Hedda,"" the women have the best moments. Jennie Linden is fine as the deceptively defenseless Mrs. Elvsted, who originally comes to Hedda's house for help and stays on to replace her. Miss Linden succeeds in uncovering the smugness underneath Mrs. Elvsted's helplessness, which then becomes a weapon as lethal as Hedda's arrogant demand for perfection.The physical production is handsome, and Mr. Nunn is most successful in preserving the claustrophobic nature of the play without creating a static film. ""Hedda"" is an imaginative, intelligent film version of a play that I wasn't breathlessly waiting to see at this moment.",1976-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Gassman in 'Scent of a Woman',"""Scent of a Woman"" is about a journey and a destination. The journey is funny, acid and intriguing. The destination is mawkish, melodramatic and interminable.A young soldier is called to present himself at a house in Turin and place himself for seven days at the service of a retired captain, blinded in an explosion. The captain, played by Vittorio Gassman, is a handsome, vigorous man whose aristocratic arrogance suffers horribly not so much from the deprivation as the humiliation of his blindness.He is bitter, sarcastic, domineering, and his handicap has inflated his native lechery to satyriasis. All these qualities are fully displayed in the curious train trip he sets out upon with his hapless traveling companion. The destination is Naples; they stop at Genoa and Rome.The captain continually makes scenes. In the train, drunk, he insists on pressing whisky on a starchy old gentleman. When the latter only pretends to drink, the captain  whose other senses are almost sharp enough to compensate for blindness  slaps him and drives him from the compartment.In Genoa, the captain embarks on a hilarious search for a prostitute. He can smell women, he tells Ciccio, his companion, but for proper choice needs a description as well. So he goes through Genoa sniffing and considering Ciccio's thumbnail descriptions until he meets a woman who seems to suit.He requires assistance  hence Ciccio  but won't admit it. When he sits in a cafe he demands a newspaper as well as coffee. In Genoa, when a woman asks directions, he insists on giving them even though he can't see and doesn't know the city.These things work well, and the relationship between the tormented captain and the good natured, though sometimes rebellious Ciccio has humor and bite. It helps that the purpose of the journey is a mystery: Ciccio discovers a pistol and a portrait of a girl in the captain's suitcase.The Rome sequence is a heavier replay of the adventures in Genoa. And finally they arrive in Naples. The journey is over, but the movie has a long, long way to go.The captain is meeting another blinded officer, with whom he has a suicide pact. At the same time, there is the girl in the portrait who loves him, and whom he loves, but whose lovebecause of his blindnesshe is too proud to accept. Love, pride and death contend, but the real struggle is between bathos and tedium.""Scent"" was well liked at last year's Cannes Festival, and Mr. Gassman won the Best Actor prize. In retrospect it is hard to see why. His performance has force, but his role is paper-thin.

On the first communing day, the party divided in Whitewater Bay. Ludwig Johnson guided Tom Callahan of Cincinnati and Sandy Bain of New York up Shark River to Tarpon Bay, where they surprised and murdered several redfish and weakfish, known as speckled trout in Florida. Clint Jones took Jack Murphy of San Diego and his companion up near the headwaters of Roberts River to fight it out handtofin with the baby tarpon native those brackish waters. At the start of this century, when Flamingo was a nest of moonshiners, smugglers and fishermen, two families named Roberts occupied shacks on stilts there. Chances are the river was named for Uncle Billy Roberts, who was famous for his indifference to the bloodthirsty Everglades mosquitoes, which in summer are thick enough to plow. His tolerance of the critters was attributed to his habit of eating half a plug of Brown's Mule chewing tobacco at breakfast.",1976-01-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Fassbinder 'American Soldier' Is Bold and Interesting,"""The American Soldier,"" which opened at the Film Forum yesterday, is an early (1970) film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the prolific and prodigiously talented young German director whose works are turning up in this country out of their chronological order. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It keeps all of us, including critics, on edge since it's not easy to categorize his work.In the later Fassbinder films to be seen here, including ""AliFear Eats the Soul"" and ""Fist-Right of Freedom"" (now being called ""Fox""), Mr. Fassbinder appears to have settledfor the time being, anywayon a rather rigorous style that is both understated in the way of cinema and exaggerated in the manner of epic theater.His interiors are cages with walls instead of bars. His landscapes, even in a city, are eerily empty, which has the effect of foreshortening perspectives, making them seem unreal. His characters, including the ulcer-ridden Moroccan worker in ""Ali"" and the put-upon homosexual in ""Fist-Right"" have tumultuous private lives, but those private lives are always political parables  if you care to read them.""The American Soldier"" is not so ambitious a film, but it is extremely interesting and often bold. The great thing about Mr. Fassbinder is that he makes films quickly and moves on (more than 20 features in less than 10 years, I'm told). He doesn't fret about mistakes or rewriting. His late films, as well as the early ones like ""The American Soldier,"" give the impression of having been created in a single burst of energy, not shot in bits and pieces over a period of time and then fitted together.""The American Soldier"" is a flamboyant but finally solemn joke that recalls early Jean-Luc Godard. Photographed in intentionally overlit black-and-white, it's the deadpan tale of a German-born gangster who returns home from America to make a couple of ""hits"" on a contract from what appears to be the police.The story is about as important as the name of the unit publicity man on your average, run-of-the-mill American disaster movie. ""The American Soldier"" is about people living lives styled after the highlights of American gangster movies, under the direction of a man who finds such movies both fascinating and funny. It's virtually an anthology of movielearned attitudes and gestures that, in the world of this particular movie, give life meaning.Ricky, the gangster, played by Karl Scheydt (who looks like a soft version of Charles Bronson), moves impassively through the film, knocking off assignments in the fashion of a distilled Alan Ladd, making love perfunctorily to women who go suddenly limp in his arms as if shot with curare, finally to be double-crossed by his employers.The film has the cold eye of the political cartoonist, as well as the political cartoonist's eye for outrageous detail: Ricky's mom and brother, who are apparently conventional middle class types, have a pinball machine in the living room and swig their morning whiskies directly from the bottle of Ballantine's.Mr. Fassbinder's achievement here is in avoiding obvious camp. The film has a languorous, dreamlike pace, a feeling of slow motion. ""The American Soldier is notas was the Warhol-Morrisey ""Heat""a parody of a familiar subject, but a contemplation of one. It could be called ""The American Gangster Movie, Theme and Variations.""",1976-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Manson, one of the four convicted in what became known as the Tate-La-Bianca murders in California in 1969. There are bits and pieces of interviews with Manson, with some of the Manson ""family"" members who were not arrested in the two murder cases (including Lynette Fromme, who later gained her own notoriety) and with Vincent T. Bugliosi, the prosecuting attorney and author of the best-selling book about the Manson trial, ""Helter-Skelter.""The producers attempt unsuccessfully to enliven the film by the use of split screens and kaleidoscopic effects, apparently meant to stimulate acid trips recollected in tranquillity, but none of it creates a point of view.
