Sunnier kids played football, wrapped houses and drank draft root beer at the Ize Box; I wore black, read Kurt Vonnegut, attended Vietnam War protests and anticipated my acceptance to Sarah Lawrence. At best, I was a fish out of water; at worst, I was an insufferable snob.

Ice slick gleamed, then disappeared in the early evening shadow, causing the sidewalks she marched along to undermine even an agile tread, let alone one with a faint limp. She should have bent her head and closed her eyes to slits in that weather, but being a stranger, she stared wide-eyed at each house, searching for the address that matched the one in the advertisement: One Monarch Street. Finally she turned into a driveway where Sandler Gibbons stood in his garage door ripping the seam from a sack of Ice-Off. He remembers the crack of her heels on concrete as she approached; the angle of her hip as she stood there, the melon sun behind her, the garage light in her face.

But ''La Bche,'' Danile Thompson's sly and delicious holiday confection, released in this country three winters ago, before the current geopolitical chill set in, suggests that, at least at the end of December, the two republics still have much in common. The movie, as dry and bubbly as a glass of Veuve Clicquot, as rich and bittersweet as the traditional holiday cake that provides its title, opens with a department-store blast of ''Jingle Bells,'' and even the most chauvinistic American viewer will be gratified to discover how many of our holiday traditions -- at least the ones displayed on screen -- also flourish in France. Music, compulsive consumerism and lavish food, of course, but also sibling rivalry, adultery, repressed family history and something called ''hostile depression,'' which roughly corresponds to what we call seasonal affective disorder. The story, which owes an obvious debt to both Chekhov and Woody Allen, concerns three sisters -- Sabine Azma, Emmanuelle Bart and Charlotte Gainsbourg -- who fight with one another, their newly widowed mother and their father (her first husband), a passionately eccentric Russian violinist. The fact that he is Jewish adds a lovely touch of schmaltz to the Christmas feast; it may also account for the film's welcome doses of tsuris, chutzpah and general mishegas, words that, even in a French movie, should require no translation.",2003-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Until there is a sovereign Iraqi government with a rebuilt national army, purged of top Baathists and carefully balanced among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, substantial international military forces will be needed.

Not much need be said, really. Ms. Bartoli does much the same here as she did in recent years for Gluck and Vivaldi, shedding light on obscure corners of repertory in imaginative, utterly committed and often gripping performances. Although sheer vocal beauty is sometimes sacrificed to drama (occasionally bordering on melodrama), there is plenty of both. And Salieri is a composer in need of reclamation -- having been scurrilously, if entertainingly, cast as Mozart's murderer in ''Amadeus'' -- and to some extent worthy of it. For all of those reasons, ''The Salieri Album'' is a must for admirers of Ms. Bartoli and for listeners interested in exploring unhackneyed areas of vocal repertory.",2003-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Still, Margaret Ammann-Durrer, daughter of Othmar Ammann, who designed the George Washington, Bayonne, Triborough, Verrazano-Narrows and Throgs Neck bridges, singles out a specific drawback. ''I was in the seventh grade when the George Washington Bridge opened, and I always despaired the fact that I was supposed to have a good mark in arithmetic,'' she said. Otherwise, growing up in the 1930's in the bridge builder's household in Boonton, alongside two brothers, ''was like living with any daddy that you love -- I had no idea what was going on in his head, but I remember him spending long hours bent over his desk at night.''

It featured recorded oud -- yes, oud -- music, hours of it, before the guests were offered more than just a single glass of Champagne. Stronger drinks had been forbidden, on the grounds that they ''corrupt the palate,'' and although hors d'oeuvres were several times promised, they failed to appear. The guests did not sit down until 11, to a meal that consisted, as one of the party recalled, ''mostly of squishy stuff,'' and the evening ended, long after midnight, with the host, who was wearing a caftan -- did I mention that? -- reading from his own poetry. It was snowing. I forgot to mention that, too, and when the guests were finally freed, there were no cabs to be found, so everyone walked home.

So Mr. Chmet created a counterpoise, an exceedingly odd feature-length animation that manages to send up France, America, gastronomy, the Tour de France, consumerism, gangsterism, heroism, professional ambition and heaven knows what else. This is not a film for very young children.

Most of the movie is set before Christmas Eve -- precisely nine months before, in fact. That's when Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton), who wants to do her patriotic bit to buoy the spirits of departing servicemen, goes to a couple of swinging socials with the boys, drinks too much punch, gets conked on the head and maybe marries someone whose name she's not sure of. She doesn't remember what happened, but there's considerable evidence in her expanding waistline that something did. ''I wanted to show what happens to young girls who disregard their parents' advice and who confuse patriotism with promiscuity,'' Preston Sturges wrote, with impish blandness, in his autobiography. Given the virgin birth angle and the triumphal finale -- in which Mussolini and Hitler are driven to madness by American fecundity -- it's more likely that he wanted to make a film in which gleeful blasphemy is so entwined with piety and patriotism that all the moralists could do was gurgle and clutch their chests.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Out in Front in Hartford,"Many great museum collections have been assembled by one man with a plan. At the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., that man was A. Everett Austin Jr. He served as director of the Wadsworth, the country's oldest art museum, from 1927 to 1944, but it was a series of acquisitions in the early 1930's that made his reputation. As recounted in SURREALISM AND MODERNISM: From the Collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum (Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University, $50), it was a fairly radical undertaking. Hartford was a thriving small city back then, but even the larger world had not fully acclimated itself to the strange visions of artists like Salvador Dal, Jean Arp and Ren Magritte. Paul Paret, who teaches art history at the University of Utah, traces the course of modern art to put the museum's works in context. Eric Zafran, the Wadsworth's curator of European painting and sculpture, recounts Austin's remarkable reign. Austin certainly did not build the remarkable collection alone -- he had the help of people like the curator and patron James Thrall Soby, a Hartford native who later headed the painting department of the Museum of Modern Art. But ultimately it was Austin who organized a Picasso retrospective in 1934, the largest in the United States to that date, and who became the first museum director to buy a work by Joseph Cornell. As Zafran tells it, Austin was short-sighted only once -- he neglected to buy Salvador Dal's ''Persistence of Memory'' because the asking price was exorbitant -- $350.

In the coming months, she will extend her run as a leading on-screen Quality Lit heroine, appearing in Robert Benton's adaptation of Philip Roth's novel ''The Human Stain'' (which opened Friday) and Anthony Minghella's ''Cold Mountain'' (Dec. 25), based on the best-selling, award winning Civil War novel by Charles Frazier. At this point, those movies may depend more on her than she does on them; her luster will only be enhanced by their success, and is unlikely to be diminished if they fail.",2003-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,The Last Word in Alienation: I Just Don't Remember,"EVER since Christopher Nolan's tricky rewind-button thriller, ''Memento,'' impressed audiences and (too many) critics a couple of years ago, amnesia has, improbably, emerged as the movies' psychological disorder of choice, eclipsing even the Oscar-winning schizophrenia of ''A Beautiful Mind.'' The amnesia craze has already produced a pair of oddball classics, David Lynch's ''Mulholland Drive'' (2001) and Aki Kaurismaki's ''Man Without a Past'' (2002), as well as a sleek, skillful suspense picture, Doug Liman's ''Bourne Identity,'' which was one of the surprise hits of 2002. In the coming weeks we're in for a full-blown epidemic: Halle Berry will be losing her memory in ''Gothika''; Ben Affleck his in ''Paycheck.'' (Insert your own ''Gigli'' joke here.) In March, Jim Carrey will be similarly afflicted in ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.'' And shooting has begun on a remake of John Frankenheimer's ''Manchurian Candidate'' (1962), a political thriller about brainwashing, which is, in its way, the greatest amnesia movie of them all.",2003-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Matthew Fleishman, a fisherman who was in the area of the crash, told the Associated Press that the two planes had appeared to be re-enacting a dogfight before one of them hit the water. Thomas J.

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Brooklyn: Judge Orders New Trial For Woman In Killing,"A federal judge in Brooklyn has ordered Suffolk County prosecutors to release or retry a woman who is serving 25 years to life for killing a man she said had raped her. The federal judge said a ruling by the trial judge had hurt the woman's ability to get a fair trial. The murder trial in 1997 of the woman, Keila Pulinario, attracted attention because Judge Gary J. Weber of Suffolk County Court first said he would permit, and then barred, a defense argument that she suffered from rape trauma syndrome. The syndrome, her lawyers said, made her fearful of being raped again and explained why she fatally shot Imagio Santana in 1995. The federal judge, Jack B. Weinstein, said on Friday that when the trial judge changed his ruling about the defense during the trial, he ''cut the legs off the defense.'' William Glaberson (NYT)",2003-11-03T05:00:00+0000

The robber was also killed. The 1999 jury ruled that the six officers, who fired 29 shots, had acted negligently. On Friday, another Manhattan jury ruled that the police had acted with reckless disregard, a more serious charge, and awarded a further $3 million in damages to Ms. Vargas's estate and $1 million to her brother, Ramon Santiago, who witnessed the shooting.

In her letter, Ms. Hauser, who has given millions of dollars to the Philharmonic, said that she had served for more than 25 years and that it was time to step down. Her resignation came on the heels of the failed merger, which she questioned from the start. She also made clear that she was frustrated with the way it was handled by Paul B. Guenther, the chairman of the Philharmonic, arguing that he had failed to involve the entire board adequately in the process. ''I believe the board must engage in a serious rethinking of the orchestra's future directions,'' she wrote in her letter. ''Bold and imaginative leadership is required if the New York Philharmonic is to fulfill its mission in the years ahead.'' Mr. Guenther said yesterday that he agreed with Ms. Hauser's comments and was sorry to lose her. Ms. Hauser's departure, effective Dec. 4, could be a blow to the planned redevelopment of the home of the Philharmonic, Avery Fisher Hall, a project that could cost as much as $250 million.

Redback listed $591.7 million in assets and $652.9 million in debts in papers filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The company, based in San Jose, Calif., has lost money each year since becoming a public company in 1999. Its shares traded at more than $179 in June 2000. Under the company's ''prepackaged'' reorganization plan, holders of the company's $467.5 million in convertible subordinated bonds agreed to exchange their investment for stock in the company, court papers show. Almost all of the voting bondholders approved the plan, which would convert the bonds into about a 95 percent stake in Redback. Redback said with the agreement with its bondholders already in place it might be able to come out of bankruptcy as soon as 60 days. A bankruptcy judge must approve the recovery plan and a $25 million loan that Redback arranged to help finance operations during the debt-restructuring process.",2003-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Arar, 33, of Ottawa, was detained at Kennedy Airport en route to Montreal from Tunisia in September 2002 and was later deported to his native Syria, instead of Canada, as he requested. Speaking publicly about his experiences for the first time since being suddenly released last month, Mr. Arar called for a public inquiry into the role that Canada might have played in his detention and deportation. Canada has denied being involved in the decision, but United States officials have said they were acting on information from Canadian law enforcement agencies when they deported Mr. Arar.

The Manhattanville College community mourns the loss of Sheila Mary Smythe, one of its most dedicated and beloved alumni and volunteer leaders, who died on November 4, 2003. Few individuals have so modestly and selflessly served Manhattanville, helping to lead the college through two decades of growth and change while serving as mentor and guide to countless former students of all ages and faiths. Few individuals have so consistently lived the college's mission, to educate ethically and socially responsible leaders for the global community. Miss Smythe, a graduate of Manhattanville College, served on the college's board of trustees for more then 20 years, beginning in 1981. Twice, she oversaw the college's search for a new president, including in 1994, when president Richard A. Berman, who serves today, was chosen. She twice served as chair of the board, most recently serving as vice-chair, member of the executive committee and academic affairs committees and chair of the trustee affairs committee. In 1981, she received the college's Distinguished Alumni Award and in 1974, the college presented her with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in recognition of her professional and personal achievements. In 1997, Manhattanville established the Sheila Mary Smythe Award, given periodically to an esteemed alumnus who has successfully worked to improve society. Over her impressive career Miss Smythe was widely respected for her vision and commitment to education and to health care, and for the strong friendships she made throughout her years of business and community leadership. After serving as president and CEO of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, she became the chief health policy advisor to the Comptroller General of the United States (U.S. General Accounting Office). In 1990, she joined New York Medical College as professor of health policy and economics, and the first dean of the Graduate School of Health Sciences. Since 1995, she also served as executive vice president of the college and president of its Partnership for a Healthy Population. In addition to serving Manhattanville College, Miss Smythe served on the boards of many business and community organizations, including the March of Dimes, Catholic Charities USA and Mutual of America Life Insurance Company. Miss Smythe earned Bachelor of Arts degrees from Manhattanville College and Creighton University, and a Master of Science degree from the Graduate School of Public Health and Administrative Medicine at Columbia University, where she also undertook doctoral studies. Miss Smythe is survived by her niece, Sheila P. Gonley, who graduated from Manhattanville College in 1992 and now lives in England. Manhattanville College has established a Shelia Mary Smythe Memorial Fund.

us,The Game Concludes With Light And Noise,"''Everything that has a beginning has an end.'' This sentence appears on the front page of the production notes handed out at press screenings of ''The Matrix Revolutions,'' which opens worldwide today. It is also uttered by the Oracle (Mary Alice) in response to a question from Neo (Keanu Reeves). ''Where is this going?'' he wants to know. ''Where will it end?'' Neo may be the One, but he can hardly be the only One posing such questions. The talk of endings in this, the third and ostensibly final movie in the series, is so insistent that you may wonder whether the Wachowski brothers, who wrote and directed it, felt the need to reassure the audience, and perhaps themselves, that it was really, finally over. There are still a few loose ends that might be spun into future sequels -- ''The Matrix Recycled,'' perhaps, or ''The Matrix Recall Election'' or ''The Matrix Recipe Book and Holiday Menu Planner'' (featuring the Oracle's baking tips) -- but the saga of Neo, which began in 1999 when he was a scruffy hacker who took a red pill, has now by all appearances reached its terminus.

Preliminary results showed that sales in the three months ended Friday rose to $93 million to $95 million, from $80.9 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2002, before McData changed its fiscal year, the company said. McData, which is based in Broomfield, Colo., had projected sales of $107 million to $112 million. EMC, a maker of computer-data storage systems, had pressed McData for lower prices on switches and had refused to accept delivery of an order, said Steven B. Berg, an analyst for Punk, Ziegel & Company. The dispute prevented some revenue from being recorded in the quarter, McData said. McData's Class A shares fell 40 cents, or 4 percent, to $9.63.

IDX won a contract from the Commerce Department in 2001 to lead a $9.2 million research venture with four other companies, the filing said. The employee later asserted that IDX ''never had a serious interest in researching the technological solutions described in the proposal,'' the filing said. The company assumes the complaint was ''filed by a disgruntled employee,'' a spokeswoman, Margo Happer, said.

He was both a creative scientist and an empathetic administrator. He became Director of the School in the College of Natural Sciences in September 2001 after serving several years as chairman of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. During his tenure as the School's Director, he worked unceasingly to increase the interactions between two seemingly disparate groups of biological scientists, those who study whole organisms and those like Dr. Gottlieb who study specific molecular processes. His achievements have left an enduring legacy at the University. Dr. Gottlieb expanded programs and helped increase funding for biological research and for both graduate and undergraduate education. Gottlieb received a BA from Princeton University in 1965. He then earned a doctoral degree from The Rockefeller University, working with Nobel Laureate Gerald Edelman. After a post-doctoral fellowship at Stanford Gottlieb took a faculty appointment at MIT. He came to the University of Texas as Professor in 1980. His research focused on the cells that constitute the body's immune system. In his early career, he made seminal contributions to deciphering the structure and function of antibodies, laying the groundwork for understanding how each immune cell produces only a single antibody. Later, he worked to understand the function of a major class of immune cells, called killer T cells. Gottlieb also discovered a new gene important for T cell function and for cardiovascular system development. Mice lacking this protein have an embryonic heart defect that has important implications for cardiac disease in children. A co-author of more than 70 scientific articles, Gottlieb also served as an editor of various immunology journals and as a member of national research immune cell produces only a single antibody.

She is not, in fact, immediately recognizable until you get up close and see those extraordinary wraparound eyes, long, narrow and a searching pale blue.

''I thought it looked like a parrot, myself,'' said the spokeswoman, Marianna Thompson. Nonetheless, she said the diocese would not discourage people from visiting the stump.

It's a world that countless American readers are familiar with and, over the last five decades, have come to associate with similarly perplexed, male and yearning viewpoints presented by Saul Bellow and John Updike -- the writers widely regarded as occupying the two other spots on the medal podium of living American novelists.

He had on jeans and a faded blue shirt that flapped around his thin torso, and his hair was still damp from a swim in the pond that lies at the foot of a grassy hill and a short walk from his two-story Swiss chalet-style house. A patio umbrella and several weathered lawn chairs were set up along the edge, and there was a dock with a wooden diving board that Ruffalo and his younger brother, Scott, a hairdresser in Beverly Hills, built last summer. When the brothers were growing up in Kenosha, Wis., they built many tree houses in the woods near their family's house -- Scott guesses they built one every 10 feet -- and they called themselves the Foresters. Two years ago, when Mark was recovering from surgery to remove a benign tumor in his brain, and thinking that his film career had ended just as it was taking off with his widely praised performance in ''You Can Count on Me,'' he designed the large sleeping porch at the back of the house.

us,Inside George Orwell," As a young man Eric Blair was fascinated by ghost stories and intrigued by black magic. Once, seemingly to deadly effect, he laid a curse on a schoolboy who had offended him. On another occasion he reported seeing a ghost. Later, he told a friend that he used a pseudonym so that no enemy could take his name and work magic against him. In dreams he looked for symbols and interpretations, and more than once had highly prophetic visions. None of this quite fits with the widely held image of a man who transformed himself into the writer of clear-headed, rational and lucid prose, George Orwell. But behind every bearer of a pseudonym there stands an individual life, an individual who can appear in various guises and a life which can come to us in different versions. That is because personalities and lives are kaleidoscopic - records, images glimpsed behind words or lodged in reminiscence, fragments viewed and re-viewed through the mirrors of memory and conscious reflection, all projected in turn in new configurations through the eyes of biographers.

Perhaps these golden girls thought it would all fall in their laps, and they wouldn't have to compete with equally ambitious colleagues, network, butter up the bosses, mentor novices to be able to have dependable assistants. Perhaps they weren't taught the old feminist lessons of how to fight informal discrimination against women. Perhaps they got stymied by the stigma of anything smacking of a ''mommy track.''

us,An Appeal to Himself,"Tony Hoagland's disarming poetry collection WHAT NARCISSISM MEANS TO ME (Graywolf, paper, $14) has the appeal of a mean-but-funny friend, a smart aleck you can't dismiss, he's so entertaining and (most of the time) so spot on in his insights. Hoagland's central subject is the self, specifically, a prickly, grandiose American masculine poetic self, or to be more specific still, what the author ruefully labels in one poem ''a government called Tony Hoagland.'' In a recent essay, Hoagland made the case for meanness in poetry as ''metaphysical straight-talk,'' and there is something refreshing about his willingness to expose his crummier impulses: rooting for a white tennis player, hating his detractors ''from the core of my donkey soul.'' But some of Hoagland's sharpest offerings are insightful portraits of others, like the woman who despised her husband ''as a way of pushing off, / like you would push off from the wall of a swimming pool'' or a newly minted wine expert who ''squints as if recalling his childhood in France.'' A chorus of friends chimes in in several poems, dishing up aphorisms like ''That woman has a Ph.D. in Face.'' Hoagland's wisecrack lyricism doesn't always jell, and a few jokes fall flat. But a prickly force carries the day, building a portrait of emotional longing that is ''like a heavy piece of furniture inside you; / you carry it, it burdens you, it drags you down -- / then you stop, and rest on top of it.''

I wrote that with Charles and Harvey Miller. After that, I wrote ''Irreconcilable Differences'' with Charles, and then we wrote the ''Father of the Bride'' movies and ''The Parent Trap.'' Collaboration is great for screenwriting. It's not as simple as two heads are better than one, but if you find the right person, you can feed off each other. But I don't think I could have collaborated on my latest film, ''Something's Gotta Give.'' I had an idea about a man who chronically dates younger women, who meets the mother of a girl he's dating.

Concerned that competition for admission may encourage high school seniors to exaggerate their accomplishments, the University of California decided to conduct a random check of applications for this fall's freshman class. About 10 percent of the 77,000 applicants were asked to provide documentation backing up claims about extracurricular activities, awards and personal statements. The result? There wasn't a liar in the bunch. ''There was no evidence to suggest falsification,'' says Susan Wilbur, director of undergraduate admissions. While other universities might investigate obviously suspicious claims, California is said to be the first to use a formal verification process.

With ''Greendale,'' loyalty pays off: what comes out of the jewel-box is a completely viable artifact, on the basis of the audio disc and accompanying booklet alone. The bonus DVD, featuring a solo live performance of the same basic material that's presented on the audio disc and in print, is nice but redundant. Better to consume this product by treating it as a hybrid between a printed work and a book-on-tape -- to read it as one reads a novel, because in fact that's what it is. Mr. Young has always been remarkable for his creative resilience, and this time he really has done something new, rendering into this combination of print and audio a novel that is surprisingly sophisticated and satisfyingly complete.",2003-11-09T05:00:00+0000

(At first, the band distributed the disc on its own; last Tuesday, the independent label Yep Roc released the album nationwide.)

Alexander the Great, presiding at the Macedonian court as a boy while his father, Philip, was absent on campaign, was remembered by visitors from thelands he would later conquer for his persistence in questioning them about the size of the population of their territory, the productiveness of the soil, the course of the routes and rivers that crossed it, the location of its towns, harbours and strong places, the identity of the important men. The young Alexander was assembling what today would be called economic, regional or strategic intelligence, and the knowledge he accumulated served him well when he began his invasion of the Persian empire, enormous in extent and widely diverse in composition. Alexander triumphed because he brought to his battlefields a ferocious fighting force of tribal warriors personally devoted to the Macedonian monarchy; but he also picked the Persian empire to pieces, attacking at its weak points and exploiting its internal divisions.

The visitor and her colleagues are interested in purchasing the rights to the couple's life story on behalf of an outfit called ''Steven Spielberg Associates and Incorporated.'' This curiously named company's motives are summed up in a classic Old European canard: since Americans have no history of their own, someone observes, they are compelled to go around buying that of other people. At the news conference following the film's screening at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, a journalist asked Godard what he had against Steven Spielberg. Of course it was nothing personal, Godard replied, and in any case a proper answer would require a detailed, shot-by-shot analysis of Spielberg's movies, for which there was, alas, insufficient time.",2003-11-09T05:00:00+0000

The Remedia baby formula, a kosher, soya-based product made by the German firm Humana, has been pulled from store shelves, and the police have opened a criminal investigation. The Israeli Health Ministry said the absence of the B1 vitamin is believed to have caused the babies to suffer from beriberi, a disease that leads to serious neurological and heart problems. But Humana's chief, Rolf Janshen, said in Germany that independent laboratories had checked the formula and that ''contrary to the Israeli findings, vitamin B1 has been found,'' Reuters reported.

Atlantic Coast is a regional carrier for United Airlines and operates for United under the name of United Express, but it has been saying it wants to end that relationship and start a low-cost airline. Investors and analysts have been skeptical, and the share value of Atlantic Coast dropped after it first announced its intentions in July. Getting the pilots to ratify the contract was a critical step toward creating that new airline, as some experts predicted that the pilots' union would balk. Atlantic Coast said that the new contract, which goes into effect only if the low-cost airline goes into operation, creates a new pay scale for pilots flying Boeing 737's or Airbus A320's. The Mesa Air Group, another regional airline, is trying to buy out Atlantic Coast to create the country's largest regional carrier. Edward Wong (NYT)",2003-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The strikers had wanted 20 percent, while Volkswagen had stuck to its initial offer of 16 percent. Volkswagen, which is planning to cut 4,000 jobs in Brazil, could appeal the ruling.

While beet, with its magenta hue, is the most striking, the red pepper is the eye-opener.

Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., licensed the drug from Immunomedics, which develops products for cancer and infectious diseases, in 2000. The companies stopped a test of the drug earlier this year. New medicines approved after that trial began also are designed to treat patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who no longer respond to older treatments, the companies said at the time. In a statement, Immunomedics said the partners were unable to settle terms of an expanded agreement that would have allowed Amgen to sell the drug worldwide. Ms. Hawkins said Amgen's decision not to proceed with the drug was based on more than a disagreement over marketing. She declined to elaborate. Calls to executives with Immunomedics, based in Morris Plains, N.J., were not returned.

Fortunately, to make a bomb, the uranium needed further enrichment and the amount of plutonium was insufficient. In other words, Iran seems to have been caught at an early stage of a secret program. But nobody can be sure whether this is the whole truth or whether Iran simply admitted what it thinks international inspectors already know. It is especially troubling that the inspectors -- who revealed Iran's admission in a new report from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- found traces of highly enriched uranium that have yet to be satisfactorily explained.",2003-11-12T05:00:00+0000

The chief executive, Frank Cicutto, left, said a 20 percent increase this year in the value of the Australian dollar, which reached a four-year high against the United States dollar, reduced the bank's profit by 65 million Australian dollars. The bank said that profit expansion could slow this year because of an expected decline in the national growth of home lending, now at record levels. The company's last fiscal year ended on Sept. 30.

The parents of the girl, Cecilia Zhang, say they awoke on Oct. 20 to find their daughter's bed empty and a window in their house forced open. Early in the investigation, the police suggested it was not a random attack by a predator, and said they were focusing on a possible kidnapping for money but have not discussed any evidence. The girl's parents, immigrants from China, as well as college students who rent rooms in their house, have been ruled out as suspects, the police said.

It focused on why so few new apartments have been built in Manhattan since 1980, despite a solid economy and escalating real estate prices. The study's authors -- Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard and Joseph Gyourko of the University of Pennsylvania -- concluded, by a mathematical analysis of costs, that government regulations were a form of tax. It can amount to as much as 50 percent of the total price of the median condominium, for example, the authors said. The study did not cite specific regulations.

Rene Kahn, the preservationist, had urged the city's zoning board to stop a condominium development that would have leveled the French Normandy castle on the 30-acre estate. Under the compromise, developers, who once called the building ''not historically significant,'' have agreed to convert much of it into two condominium units that would be offered for sale along with 57 newer units. In exchange, Ms. Kahn plans to tell the board that she no longer objects to the project. Alison Leigh Cowan (NYT)",2003-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, thousands of people have been questioned about their immigration status and hundreds have been detained, sometimes for long periods. But advocacy groups for the immigrants say that low-income detainees have difficulty getting lawyers because phone calls from jail are costly and toll-free numbers are generally unavailable. The New Jersey Civil Rights Defense Committee and the state chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations helped start the toll-free service in Passaic and hope to get Hudson, Bergen and Middlesex County jails to allow it.

He leers, sneers and offers some self-analysis: ''Supermarket'' and ''Til Wrong Feels Right'' sum up his complicity and disgust with pop as product. ''Skull Ring'' is part reunion, part tribute; the pop-punk whippersnappers Green Day and Sum 41 also back him up, and Peaches raps some deadpan smut alongside him.

Her formal compositions have depicted her friends in candid moments -- in bars and clubs, funky bedrooms and bathrooms, hanging out, having sex, doing drugs, looking warily at each other, themselves or the camera. Often these characters were estranged from society, but not necessarily from each other, and especially not from the photographer. Anything and anyone Ms. Goldin shot were intimate to her. In exhibitions and in books, she has included some self-portraits, a few of which presented devastating views of her own self-destructiveness. But, she suggests, no portrait of her could be complete without the people she loves and what's around her. ''The Ballad of Sexual Dependency,'' the work in which she first documented her friends and herself, her scene, forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last 20 years.",2003-11-16T05:00:00+0000

There are devastating moments in ''The Barbarian Invasions'' (which opens Friday), but the movie feels vigorous and elemental. It's also entertaining.

It was around 1 a.m. on a Thursday in late June, and he was in the V.I.P. room at the 40/40 Club, the sports bar he owns on West 25th Street in Manhattan. The professional basketball stars Antoine Walker and Tracy McGrady sat on one side of the room playing cards while Jay-Z was in a corner holding court with the producer Timbaland and the 18-year-old basketball phenom LeBron James, who seemed more interested in playing a video game on his cellphone. There was a neo-Rat Pack vibe to the scene: lounging millionaires, tall models playing pool, and a sexy waitress in a short skirt offering cognac and cigars. Jay-Z seemed to be on top of the world. But then he let slip that he would soon retire from hip-hop. His next album, ''The Black Album,'' would be his last. ''It's not like it was with Big and Pac,'' he said, referring to the rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, whose deaths in the late 90's ushered in a new era in hip-hop.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Outside the Brochures,"Draped in beaded jewelry and bright cloth, the Masai people of East Africa are familiar images in travel brochures and on posters taped to the walls of tour agencies in places like Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. But to the photojournalist Elizabeth L. Gilbert, the Masai are a culture existing in ''a fragile moment of transition,'' their traditional ways profoundly threatened by modernity. In BROKEN SPEARS: A Maasai Journey (Atlantic Monthly, $50), Gilbert displays, in dramatic black-and-white photographs and in an accompanying text that is nearly as beguiling as her pictures, the results of the four-year mission she assigned herself in 1998: to document, before it is too late, the rituals that shape the lives of the Masai. She traveled deep into the 5,000-square-mile tract of wilderness that begins south of Nairobi and stretches far into Tanzania -- Masailand -- where most of the approximately 400,000 Masai make their homes; many of them raising cattle near their thatched houses mortared with sun-hardened cow dung, and marking the stages of their lives with elaborate, intensely emotional rites. Through often delicate negotiations, Gilbert gained access to circumcision rituals for both sexes, an arranged marriage involving a 14-year-old girl and rites marking the induction and retirement of Masai warriors, those ''tall, flirtatious and confident'' young men who spend the seven most fulfilling years of their lives in the bush, hunting, defending their camps and raiding the camps of others. Gilbert's remarkable photographs of a traditional lion hunt -- the ultimate event in a warrior's life but now illegal in much of Masailand -- are but a few of the vivid illustrations of her journey into ''history suspended in time.''

Miller and Sylvan Lawrence, devoted husband of the late Estelle G. Cohn, cherished father of Paula Hallman and Marc Cohn, revered brother-in-law of Leon and Joan Grossman and Alice Lawrence, beloved grandfather of Bridget Hallman, Samantha Hallman, Ellen and Corey Menscher and Daniel Cohn, respected father-in-law of Eric Hallman and Melanie Cohn and uncle or great-uncle to each and every member of the family. Even in a large family noted for its accomplishments, Seymour was an over-achiever. He was an outstanding athlete throughout high school and college; his favorite sports being football and basketball. In what would become the hallmark of his life, Seymour met every challenge he faced head-on, with his eyes open regardless of any pitfalls or consequences. Seymour began his long career in the real estate business at any early age, working for his late uncle Elias A. Cohen, one of the great real estate men of his generation. After World War II ended, Seymour, newly married, decided to open his own firm. Soon after, he decided to team up with his younger brother Sylvan, beginning a uniquely close working relationship which lasted until Sylvan's passing in 1981. It was said the two lived and breathed real estate. In the 1950's, at the end of each long day, they would continue to talk real estate during the long drive home. In what will surely be remembered as one of the great New York success stories of the last hundred years, the two brothers, who started with nothing and labored tirelessly for almost 30 years, had amassed a real estate portfolio of over 100 properties, located mainly in downtown and midtown Manhattan and in Brooklyn. Over the course of sixty-odd years, the great names in real estate, people who will be remembered for years to come, made deals with, knew and respected Seymour Cohn. Many will remember Seymour for his tenacity and determination. His great intelligence, imagination and ingenuity were always balanced by a keen sense of the practical. Always thinking about the future, Seymour maintained an ever-watchful eye on the present. For over 40 years, Seymour devoted himself to a sport he so enjoyed. Like a real estate deal done right, nothing pleased him as much as watching a win by one of his homebred Thoroughbreds. As he did in the real estate business, Seymour's tireless and unflagging effort made over the years, earned him the respect of everyone with a true understanding of New York horse racing. Despite his success, Seymour particularly enjoyed life's simple joys, especially his family, with whom he kept in constant touch. Seymour relished his summers spent at Tranquillity Camp, started by his late uncle Elias A. Cohen in 1919 as a summer haven in the country for deserving children with outstanding academic records. Carrying on the family's long-held belief in helping others in the spirit of ''Noblesse Oblige,'' Seymour devoted an enormous amount of time and energy to his beloved Tranquillity. As the special man he was, Seymour's philanthropies, both great and small, were as varied as the people whose lives he touched. Seymour was one of the original founders of the North Shore Synagogue in Syosset, NY. In later years he was devoted to the restoration of the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. These were only a few of his most enduring qualities. Seymour will forever be remembered in our hearts for his ever-ready smile and that twinkle in his eye, maybe even a wink. The passing of his larger-than-life presence has left a void which can never be filled. Services will be held on Sunday, November 16, 2003, 9 AM, at Schwartz Brothers - Jeffer Memorial Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd., Forest Hills, NY, (718) 263-7600.

In fact, many parents I know agree that the most dreaded word in elementary school education is ''project.''

As he swayed with the unsteady rhythms of the city's populist heart, he could have been any other executive on his way to work in Lower Manhattan. But the unexpected phone call on this day in February 1955 meant that Rockefeller would make his commute in the back of a gray Cadillac limousine that carried two telephones, enough room for seven passengers, and license plates that read, very simply, WZ. Those were the initials of William Zeckendorf, the unpredictable, inventive, and stupendously energetic real estate promoter-and an old Rockefeller family friend-who had called to say he had an idea that couldn't wait.

He packed up his Palo Alto household for the season and with his wife, Susan, and two toddlers, headed for Sunriver, Ore., a resort area in Deschutes National Forest. ''It's not like Aspen,'' Wood says. ''It's a regular place, and it's beautiful.'' It was there, biking on a trail surrounded by ponderosa and lodgepole pines, sandwiched between the river and snowcapped mountains, that he resolved his fate: ''I settled on the idea of starting a company in the digital-media-player space,'' he says, ''since it was going like gangbusters.'' He couldn't get excited about being a ''hired gun.''",2003-11-16T05:00:00+0000

His accomplishments were bountiful. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa from NYU in 1938, he went on to receive a Master's in Biochemistry prior to attending Louisiana State University Medical School where he graduated first in his Class of 1943.

Sinai, authored a world famous computer electrocardiography textbook, penned countless articles published in prestigious medical journals and served as Captain and Head of the hospital in Udine, Italy during WWII.

us,Pushkin," Aleksandr Pushkin was born in Moscow on Thursday 26 May 1799, in a ""half-brick and half-wooden house"" on a plot of land situated on the corner of Malaya Pochtovaya Street and Gospitalny Lane. This was in the eastern suburb known as the German Settlement, to which foreigners had been banished in 1652. Though distant from the centre, it was, up to the fire of 1812, a fashionable area, ""the faubourg Saint-Germain of Moscow."" On 8 June he was baptized in the parish church, the Church of the Epiphany on Elokhovskaya Square. And that autumn his parents, Sergey and Nadezhda, took him and his sister Olga-born in December 1797-to visit their grandfather Osip Gannibal, Nadezhda's father, on his estate at Mikhailovskoe, in the Pskov region. Most of the next year was spent in St. Petersburg. The Emperor Paul, coming across Pushkin and his nurse, reprimanded the latter for not removing the baby's cap in the presence of royalty, and proceeded to do so himself. In the autumn they moved back to Moscow, where they were to remain for the duration of Pushkin's childhood. ",2003-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Justice Richard A. Molea of State Supreme Court dismissed the second of two lawsuits filed by Robert Bernstein against the project. The lawsuit had contended that the town was improperly financing the acquisition of the land, which borders Route 9 in Tarrytown and a portion of the New York State Thruway. In September, Justice Molea dismissed the other Bernstein suit, which claimed the town had improperly denied him access to records. The town board was scheduled to vote Wednesday on the appropriation of $3.7 million to acquire the property, but the vote was held over to the Nov. 24 meeting.

us,THEATER: NEW HEAD FOR THE WING,"Howard Sherman, a veteran of the nonprofit theater world, has been named the executive director of the American Theater Wing, which owns the Tony Awards and produces the Tony Awards show with the League of American Theaters and Producers. Mr. Sherman, who had been interim director for four months, replaces Roy A. Somlyo, who resigned on May 2. In the last decade, Mr. Sherman has been the executive director of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn.; the general manager of the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.; the managing director of the Geva Theater Center in Rochester; and the publicity director of the Hartford Stage Company. Mr. Sherman said his background in nonprofit theater would influence his leadership: ''In the past the focus of the wing has been largely tied to Broadway, and now we have an opportunity to reach beyond that.'' He added that he hoped to use television and the Internet to promote theater. One thing that many board members credit Mr. Sherman with already accomplishing is easing the long-held tension between the American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers over the direction of the Tony Awards. ''The league's mission has been to sell Broadway as a brand,'' Mr. Sherman said in describing the friction between the organizations. ''Our interest is in celebrating excellence. That is not identical.'' JASON ZINOMAN",2003-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Chinadotcom's offer allows Pivotal shareholders to choose a payment of $2 cash, or $2.14 in cash and Chinadotcom shares, for each Pivotal share, it said in a statement. Pivotal has not said whether it would accept the offer, which is at least 8.1 percent higher than Monday's closing share price of $1.85. The bid follows the Pivotal board's rejection last week of an offer by the Onyx Software Corporation, valued at about $2 a share in Onyx stock. Pivotal, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, agreed last month to be acquired by the closely held Oak Investment Partners for $1.78 a share. Acquiring Pivotal would increase Chinadotcom's 2004 revenue about 30 percent to $240 million, the company said. Chinadotcom also offered Pivotal $20 million in financing to ensure that the company, which has not reported a quarterly profit in more than three years, can continue to operate. It would become part of Chinadotcom's CDC Software unit. A Pivotal spokeswoman, Leslie Castellani, declined to comment on the offer.

He was a loving husband, father and grandfather, a true Southern gentleman. From very humble beginnings, he became a leader in computer technology and research and was a respected business leader and board member for more than 20 companies. He grew up on a small tobacco farm in Gretna, VA, where he graduated from high school. With the small amount of money he saved from his own crops, he entered Virginia Polytechnical Institute, where he studied for one year before joining the U.S. Navy, where he served on a submarine rescue ship. He returned to Virginia Tech and graduated in 1951 with a degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, he took a job as a design engineer with Sperry Gyroscope Co. After about two years there, he discovered his preference for the customer and marketing side of the business and moved to a new position at W.L. Maxson Corp., a NY defense electronics contractor, in field engineering and equipment testing. He was sent to Texas by Maxson to work with Texas Instruments (TI) on a major missile program contract. Subsequently, in 1959, he began what would be a long and fruitful career at TI, culminating in his retirement 28 years later as an Executive Vice President. During his tenure at TI, his duties included overseeing several divisions, including the company's hi-tech research development department. He played a key role in landing TI's first anti-radar contracts for the Shrike missile and directed the development of its successor, the HARM missile, and its tactical radar systems. These anti-radar missile systems continued to play an important role in the Persian Gulf war and the Iraqi conflict. He subsequently held various positions running TI's radar unit and research labs, vice president of corporate and long range planning, overseeing various functions such as Corporate Development, the Defense Systems and Electronics Groups, the Materials and Controls Groups, the Latin American Division, Marketing and Consumer Products and TI's geophysical services unit, GSI. After retiring from TI in 1987, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp., or MCC, an Austin-based private research cooperative launched in 1983 to help the U.S. regain its high-tech competitiveness against other international countries. In 1992, he joined Technology Strategies and Alliances, a venture capital company focused on investments in high-tech start-up companies, as a Managing Partner. In that capacity, he was active in assisting both large and small companies in growth and diversification strategies, through alliances as well as merger and acquisition activity. He was involved as a founder, investor and served as a director on many boards in the technology sector during this period. He was a director of several companies that were sold or acquired including Western Company of North America, Control Data Corporation, Net Worth, Net Speed, and Forefront Group. After serving on the U.S. West board of directors for 10 years, he joined the board of Media One Group, a spinout. He was the chairman and lead director for Optek Technology. He also served on the boards of InterVoice-Brite Inc., Cooper Cameron, Vocal Data, Object Space, Inet Technologies Inc., Intrusion Inc. and Control Systems International. He was also the former Chairman of the National Security Industrial Association. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award for 1995 from the Virginia Tech College of Engineering, where he also served on the Committee of 100, as a member of the College's Advisory Board and Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering Advisory Board. He was an avid sportsman and an excellent athlete. He enjoyed golf, having been a member at Preston Trail Golf Club in Dallas for over thirty years, fishing, especially flyfishing for Atlantic Salmon in Labrador, skiing, especially in Taos, NM, flying his own aircraft, and boating, especially the ''September Song'' and ''Liberty'' in Maine. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Peg Brady Dove, sons and daughters-in-law Gene and Carmen Dove of Daly City, CA, Tim and Jenny Dove of Frisco, TX, Brian and Cindy Dove of Missouri City, TX and Terry Dove of New York, NY, and six grandchildren, Brendan, Brittany, Lindsay and Lana Dove of Frisco, Texas and Jessica and Brady Dove of Missouri City, TX, all of whom knew him as ''Poppy''; he was preceded in death by his daughter, Maura Dove.

The late arranger and composer Luther Henderson is also being honored with the award. In conjunction with this year's awards, the endowment is expanding this program of $25,000 fellowships, established in 1982, to six from three. In addition, it will begin to finance nonprofit concert presenters who will set up 50-state tours for some of the past and present winners, beginning next spring; Verve records will release their best music on CD's; and the endowment will produce public radio segments on the winners' careers. In announcing the awards, Dana Gioia, chairman of the endowment, said: ''I'm concerned, as a lover of jazz, that there's a whole generation of Americans who know nothing about jazz. And I'm especially concerned that there's a young generation of African-Americans who have lost touch with one of the greatest contributions of black culture. So we intend to support this expanded Jazz Masters program every year from here on, and to make it one of the fixtures of American cultural life.'' BEN RATLIFF",2003-11-19T05:00:00+0000

He was the subject of scandal: in 1906, an ambiguous encounter with a woman in the monkey house of the Central Park Zoo -- he said a look, she said a pinch -- landed him in court and in international headlines. He sang at the Metropolitan Opera more than any other artist of his day: more than 800 times in 18 seasons, in a range of roles nearly unthinkable today.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   FAY, RONALD PATRICK","FAY--Ronald Patrick. Age 74 of Heathrow, Florida, died Tuesday, November 18, 2003. Ron is lovingly remembered for his warm smile, hearty chuckle, and sense of humor. A humble and modest man, he rarely mentioned his achievements. His integrity was without question and he was born a leader. Born in Milwaukee, WI. on May 25, 1929, Ron was the second of four sons born to Patrick Fay and Charlotte Welch. All have predeceased him, as well as Jean Reniewicki, his loving wife of 26 years. Formerly President of Wendy's International, the hamburger chain, Ron's character was formed during his 12 years of parochial school. He graduated from Saint John's Cathedral H.S. in Milwaukee, WI. in 1948. He was a member of Annunciation Catholic Church in Altamonte Springs, FL. and Saint Brigid of Kildare in Dublin, OH., where he maintained a second home. Ron was a veteran of the Korean Conflict and fought in the trenches at the battles of Hamburger Hill and Pork Chop Hill, where he was decorated for his service. Ron's impressive career began as a 14-year old busboy in a W.T. Grants department store in Milwaukee, WI. Ron quickly ascended the management ranks and was National Corporate Director of Marketing and Purchasing when the company filed bankruptcy in 1975. While at Grants, he pioneered a purchasing and delivery system that was adopted widely throughout the food service industry. He joined Wendy's in 1976 as a franchisee, but in 1981, he was named President of Wendy's International, overseeing one of the most intensely competitive periods in the industry's history. Under his leadership, Wendy's launched its widely successful ''Where's the Beef'' ad campaign. Ron retired in 1986. In 1990, he returned to the working world as the Operating Partner with Bob Stine, a Wendy's franchisee in Central Florida. The growing franchise was soon a regional leader in sales and operations. Motivating people by example, Ron visited at least one restaurant every day and was well known by managers and crew people alike. Just a few weeks before his death, the partnership was sold to Wendy's International and he retired. Ron was an avid golfer and former member at Tuckaway Country Club, Milwaukee, Indian Hills Country, Club, Long Island, Cavalier Golf Club, Virginia Beach, and Firestone Country Club, Akron. He was a current member of the county club in Heathrow, FL. and the country club at Muirfield Village, in Dublin, OH. While he had three holes in one, his proudest achievement was shooting a birdie on the 18th hole to help win the Pro-Am at the Memorial Tournament in 1985, teaming with John Bench and Tom Kite. Some of Ron's other distinguished golfing partners included the former Presidents, George Bush and Gerald Ford, and Neil Armstrong, along with a host of professional golfers whom he played with in a host of Pro-Am tournaments throughout the country. Ron was well-known for his homey aphorisms: do the ordinary things extraordinarily well; Keep on keepin' on, Kill'em with Kindness; I can only wear one pair of shoes at a time; you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean. Ron is survived by his devoted wife of 16 years, Ernesta Johnson Fay, Jean's children, Kallen Fay Brown (Rev. Larry), Lancaster, OH., Erin Marie Fay, Dublin, OH., Christopher Fay, Austin, TX., along with Ernie's children, Jennifer Nester (Steve), Lewis Center, OH., and Zachary Johnson (Shannon), Santa Barbara, CA., four grandchildren, Tarah, Derek and Kevin Brown of Lancaster, OH., and Luke Nester of Lewis Center, OH. Visitation will be held Saturday, November 22nd, 3-5PM at BaldwinFairchild Funeral Home, 994 E. Altamonte Dr., Altamonte Springs, FL. 32701 with a wake service 5PM at the funeral home.

I knew some of his etchings when I was a high-school student in Australia, and one of them became the first work of art I ever bought-in those far-off days before I realized that critics who collect art venture onto ethically dubious ground. My purchase was a poor second state of Capricho 43, El sueno de la razon produce monstruos (""The sleep of reason brings forth monsters""), that ineffably moving image of the intellectual beset with doubts and night terrors, slumped on his desk with owls gyring around his poor perplexed head like the flying foxes that I knew so well from my childhood. The dealer wanted ten pounds and I got it for eight, making up the last quid with coins, including four sixpenny bits. It was the first etching I had ever owned, but by no means the first I had seen. My family had a few etchings. They were kept in the pantry, face to the wall, icons of mild indecency-risque in their time-in exile. My grandfather, I suppose, had bought them, but they had offended my father's prudishness. They were the work of an artist vastly famous in Australia and wholly unknown outside it, a furiously energetic, charismatic, and mediocre old polymath called Norman Lindsay, who believed he was Picasso's main rival and whose bizarre mockoco nudes-somewhere between Aubrey Beardsley and Antoine Watteau, without the pictorial merits of either and swollen with cellulite transplanted from Rubens-were part of every Australian lawyer's or pubkeeper's private imaginative life.

But the real pleasures are discovering the more obscure songs, like the comic duet in the following excerpt from Loesser's first musical, ''Where's Charley?,'' produced in 1948, two years before his smash ''Guys and Dolls.'' The song, ''Make a Miracle,'' has earned no less a distinction than an endorsement from Stephen Sondheim, who put it on a list of songs he wished he had written himself.

Both his first movie, ''Amores Perros'' (2000), and his second, ''21 Grams,'' which opened Friday, tell multiple stories of people whose lives are forcibly entwined by a bloody car crash. But if Mr. Gonzlez Irritu is sometimes spoken of as Mexico's answer to Quentin Tarantino, the violence in his films is anything but playful. On the contrary, he uses it to underscore the pain and fragility of life. ''Amores Perros'' won more than two dozen awards worldwide, propelling Mr. Gonzlez Irritu, 40, into the front rank of directors who matter. Judging by its critical reception, ''21 Grams,'' shot in Memphis, Tenn., and starring Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, will only solidify that position.

us,Castles of Steel," On an afternoon in early July 1914, a middle-aged man with restless, bright blue eyes and curly, iron-gray hair boarded his yacht in the German Baltic harbor of Kiel, and the following morning departed on his annual summer cruise to the fjords of Norway. Two unusual and striking features marked the vacationing traveler: one of these he was eager to display; the other he was even more anxious to conceal. The first was his famous brushy mustache with its extended, upturned points, the creation of a skillful barber who worked on it every morning with a can of wax. The other, hidden from sight, but all the more noticeable for that, was his left arm, three inches shorter than the right. This misfortune was the result of an extraordinarily difficult breech delivery performed without anesthesia on his eighteen-year-old mother, Princess Victoria of England. He was unable to raise his left arm, and the fingers on his left hand were paralyzed. Every doctor had been consulted, every treatment attempted; nothing worked. Now, the useless hand was gloved and carried in his pocket, or placed at rest on the hilt of a sword or a dagger. At meals, a special one-piece knife-and-fork set was always placed next to his plate. To compensate for the helplessness of his left arm, he had developed the right to an unusual degree. He always wore large jeweled rings on his right hand; sometimes, grasping a welcoming hand so hard that the rings bit and the owner winced, the hand shaker said merrily, ""Ha ha! The mailed fist! What!"" ",2003-11-23T05:00:00+0000

Nixon was a straight arrow and a scold. If he'd been one of us we would have glued his shoes to the floor. Kennedy, though-here was a warrior, an ironist, terse and unhysterical. He had his clothes under control. His wife was a fox. And he read and wrote books, one of which, Why England Slept, was required reading in my honors history seminar.

us,From Iceland to California,"Olaf Olafsson's quietly moving new novel, WALKING INTO THE NIGHT (Pantheon, $23), is the story of Kristjan Benediktsson, a successful businessman in Iceland who, one night, packs his bag and deserts his wife and children for an actress in New York. The novel opens years later in San Simeon, William Randolph Hearst's fabulous estate on the California coast, where a guilt-ridden Kristjan -- now Christian -- is the butler to Hearst himself. Though it is unclear whether Kristjan renamed himself, his deep yearning to be unshackled from his past -- relatively poor parents, a lack of education, a sense of inferiority -- is palpable. Through letters he never sends to his abandoned wife, we learn that he first reinvented himself, earlier in life, in Copenhagen, where as a young man he waited on tables and cleaned classrooms. He meets his wife there and, from the start, Kristjan feels that in her presence he ''never knew which leg to stand on.'' He lies and tells her that he is working toward his business degree. They wed in Iceland, where Kristjan confronts who he truly is, and the pretenses on which he has built his life ultimately cause him to flee. He eventually lands in San Simeon, and even as he tries to ward off his memories by consuming himself in the details of caring for Hearst's castle, he is like one of the caged animals on the property: a sad and displaced prisoner. Olafsson, who writes in English -- he is the founder and former president and C.E.O. of Sony Interactive Entertainment -- based this novel on a true story. It is an evocative tale of grief and hope.

us,The Hornets Nest," Having experienced troubles with doubtful land titles in the Carolinas, Elijah Clarke and his neighboring families were careful to get the proper documents when they obtained rights to settle near the Savannah River along the northern border of the 1773 land grant. Elijah encouraged the other men to locate their homesteads so that the entire group could remain in close contact with one another. All of the cabins were soon connected with a spiderweb of trails. Elijah and Hannah decided to build a new cabin and barn that almost joined each other, and to accept the constant animal sounds and odors in lieu of risking another fire being set by undetected intruders. This proximate location made possible an additional safety precaution, as they spent weeks of hard work putting up a stockade of upright poles, just large enough to encompass the two buildings and a small yard. Except for slits left as rifle ports and the large swinging entrance gate, the barricade cut off their view of the surrounding woods, but they did not trust the Indians who lived only a few miles away, and felt that the increased safety was worth the trouble.

The merger would integrate Rutgers, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of Technology into one 67,000-student university with campuses in New Brunswick, Newark and Camden. A preliminary blueprint for the new system was disclosed earlier this month with the release of seven draft reports, which will be reviewed by a steering committee of university leaders on Dec. 10.

He was 77. van Duuren became a world-renowned cancer researcher during his 36-year career at New York University Medical Center in New York. Soon after scientists established cigarette smoking as a major cause of human lung cancer in the 50's, van Duuren began fractionating cigarette tars and isolated 21 arcmatic hydrocarbons, 6 of which were shown to cause cancer. In the 60's, with his research group, he elucidated many important ''structure activity relationships'' not only of chemicals found in cigarette tars but those found in many classes of cancer-causing chemicals used in industrial processes. His research made it possible to predict which chemicals might be carcinogens based on their molecular structure. Soon after the discovery of the structure of DNA he extended his studies to structure activity relationships with chemical carcinogens and animal DNA. Dr. van Duuren was born in South Africa and received his Sc.D. (Doctor of Natural Sciences) in chemistry from the University of South Africa. He did post-doctoral research with renowned chemist Roger Adams at the University of Illinois and then with Nobel Laureate Donald Cram at UCLA. In 1955 he joined Institute of Environmental Medicine of New York University Medical Center as an instructor and later became Professor and the Director of the Laboratory of Organic Chemistry in Carcinogenesis. He retired in 1991. van Duuren was a consultant and served numerous agencies engaged in cancer research including the National Institutes of Health, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nutrition Foundation, the Department of Justice, and the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer. van Duuren is survived by his wife, Satloo Gurbaxani.

In 1952 his son Robert was born, and four years later the family moved to California after Nobel Prize winner William Shockley recruited Eugene from Western Electric to join him and seven other scientists and engineers to start Shockley Laboratories in Palo Alto. In 1957, these eight men, who became known as the ''Fairchild Eight'', broke away from Shockley and founded Fairchild Semiconductor; the first successful company to manufacture the silicon based transistor. This effort spawned the industry which would eventually transform Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley and was the basis for all of today's information technology. In 1959 his daughter Lisa was born, and two years later the family moved to a new house that they built in Los Altos Hills, in which Eugene and Rose would live for the rest of their lives. In 1962, he left Fairchild to start ventures of his own including Edex Teaching Machines which was bought by Raytheon. As a limited partner with Davis & Rock, and a first round investor in Intel, Eugene began a new interest in venture capital. In 1972 he joined with Tom Perkins to form the partnership now known as Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers which has spawned over 300 companies including Compaq, Genentech, Tandem Computers, Sun, and Amazon. Since becoming ''Partner Emeritus'' at KPCB, Eugene served on numerous corporate boards, advisory committees, and college boards. In 1989 he received an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Polytechnic University where he had served as a Trustee. Eugene was inducted into the Silicon Valley Business Hall of Fame, and in 2000 was named Outstanding Mechanical Engineer of the Century by Polytechnic University. Throughout his career he was a respected mentor and advisor to many. He died in his home that he built 42 years ago on a hill overlooking Silicon Valley. Memorial services will be held at Congregation Beth Am, 26790 Arastradero Rd., Los Altos Hills at 1:00PM, Friday, December 5, 2003. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to Polytechnic University, 6 Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201, Attn: Richard Thorsen.",2003-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Its developers, a consortium called United Entertainment Partners, had claimed the project would cost 7 billion euros ($8.3 billion), create 40,000 jobs and attract 37 million tourists each year.

The deal is another step in Kodak's forced migration from its photography past to a hoped-for digital imaging future. It also further blurs the competitive distinctions in the digital imaging world, in which the copier giant Xerox now sells printers and the printer giant Hewlett-Packard sells cameras and copiers. Kodak said the Scitex unit would add $190 million to sales in its first full year as a Kodak subsidiary. More important, it gives Kodak a powerful entry into the growing market for variable-data printing on items like bills and credit card statements, which must be customized for each recipient. And it gives Kodak a vehicle to commercialize some of its own inkjet printing patents. Kodak already sells large printers through NexPress and Kodak Polychrome Graphics and through its Encad subsidiary, but the products are geared toward mass print runs. Claudia H.

He was active in many business, philanthropic and community endeavors in Manhattan and Dalton. Mr. Durkan is survived by a sister, Mary Durkan Knizie of Belle Harbor, NY; his children, Tara E. Durkan of Redondo Beach, CA; Thomas R. Durkan, III , of Dalton, GA; Patricia A. Durkan of New York City; James P. Durkan of Chattanooga, TN; and Charles W.

Fortunately, their idea failed. Corpus Christi, which means ''Body of Christ'' in Latin, eventually expanded into a city of 270,000 but has remained a laid-back playground destination on the Gulf Coast. Bathed in sunlight (winter temperatures in the 70's and 80's) and lined with palm trees, Corpus Christi is where the varied cultures and subcultures of South Texas -- Tejano, Anglo, rancher, wildcatter, beach bum, entrepreneur, seaman and many others -- come together next to the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Even though a port was eventually built -- and remains among the busiest in the nation, ferrying cotton, sorghum, petroleum and shrimp -- Corpus Christi retains the feeling of a place that prefers to be far from the hustle of bigger cities.

Born on November 28, 1941, to Euphie and Frank Walker, he was proud to be a 5th generation Texan and native of Ft. Worth. He was a graduate of the University of Texas and a U.S. Army veteran. Professionally, he enjoyed much success as an innovative and enthusiastic advocate for futures and options markets. He served as a Vice President for Dean Witter, General Manager of Clayton Brokerage and Vice President of Marketing for two major commodities exchanges (COMEX and NYBOT), as well as a teacher and a term as a small town mayor in Texas. On a personal level, his life and work touched many people. Tom's talent and creative energy joined with his endless store of generosity, warmth, and kindness could lighten the heaviest heart and illuminate the darkest of days. He loved his family, his friends and his work without qualification. And those who had the good fortune to share his days loved him dearly in return. His loss is great; his life--a treasure.

Not until 1956, when Grace Kelly used the purse to shield her pregnant belly from a photographer, was the bag elevated to celebrity status. To understand why a Kelly costs $5,500 (or more) and requires a year's wait (or more), we requested an Herms bag in red box leather, 35 centimeters long.

us,Drawing With Scissors,"Romare Bearden was ''probably the most saintly person I have ever known,'' recalled the owner of Books & Company on Madison Avenue near the Whitney Museum; the artist spent almost every Saturday afternoon at Books until his death in 1988. Bearden sliced up many of his beloved books for the sake of his collages, in which he always stayed close to black American culture in subject matter while stylistically roaming the lexicon of modern art. Yet we are given these vivid details only on the last page of Ruth Fine's studious text in THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN (National Gallery of Art/Abrams, $50), which, disappointingly, does not make the man leap off the page as palpably as his images -- pieced together with the sensibility of jazz or quilting from photocopies, sandpaper, fabric, foil and his own paintings. (''The skill with which he wielded his scissors transformed that implement into a refined drawing tool,'' Fine observes.) She does an admirable job bridging the numerous gaps in Bearden scholarship (even the year of his birth is questionable, but she settles on 1911). As a young man Bearden was molded both by the work of George Grosz at the Art Students League and the intellectual community in Harlem. His art would always straddle the two realms above and below 110th Street; one reviewer wrote in 1971, Bearden ''explores his culture and our culture with the delicate sensuality of a good physician feeling for broken bones.'' Whether this ''double consciousness'' posed internal conflict for Bearden -- Fine refers to an emotional breakdown in 1956 -- remains elliptical, even in his own words: ''There are roads out of the secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others.''

us,'Oracle Night'," I began with small outings, no more than a block or two from my apartment and then home again. I was only thirty-four, but for all intents and purposes the illness had turned me into an old man-one of those palsied, shuffling geezers who can't put one foot in front of the other without first looking down to see which foot is which. Even at the slow pace I could manage then, walking produced an odd, airy lightness in my head, a free-for-all of mixed-up signals and crossed mental wires. The world would bounce and swim before my eyes, undulating like reflections in a wavy mirror, and whenever I tried to look at just one thing, to isolate a single object from the onrush of whirling colors-a blue scarf wrapped around a woman's head, say, or the red taillight of a passing delivery truck-it would immediately begin to break apart and dissolve, disappearing like a drop of dye in a glass of water. Everything shimmied and wobbled, kept darting off in different directions, and for the first several weeks I had trouble telling where my body stopped and the rest of the world began. I bumped into walls and trash bins, got tangled up in dog leashes and scraps of floating paper, stumbled on the smoothest sidewalks. I had lived in New York all my life, but I didn't understand the streets and crowds anymore, and every time I went out on one of my little excursions, I felt like a man who had lost his way in a foreign city.

(In a recent interview at his New York gallery, he said he owes this to a conspiracy of monks who were movie freaks.)

Long time resident of New York City and Westchester; living in New Jersey for the last twelve years. Left Austria in the early 1930's to follow a theatrical career, which took her all over Europe. While working in cabaret in Czechoslovakia, met and married Albert Wolf, a bridge master, and thereafter immigrated to the U.S. in 1937. When the Nazis invaded Austria in the Spring of 1938 she immediately started to find sponsors to facilitate the immigration of her family to the U.S. Thanks to her efforts most of them escaped the Nazi terror. Her father, aunt, and many others in the family were killed by the Nazis. In the early 1950's she was divorced and thereafter married Mario Rubini-Reichlin, a prominent New York voice teacher which brought her in contact with the world of opera, theater and cantorial music. They resided at Carney Hall (where he maintained his studio) and had a home in Tanglewood. Until his death in 1968 she and Mario were active in the music entertainment scene in New York and Tanglewood and had contacts with Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern and many other entertainment figures.

Artists are influenced primarily by other artists, which means that standard art history can sound like a baseball broadcast of an infield play: Velzquez to Goya to Picasso. And designers? To be sure, they are aware of the products of other designers, but their attention is not so narrowly focused. When, near the end of his life, Isamu Noguchi, who straddled the boundary between art and design, created a sculpture garden in Costa Mesa, Calif., he was unquestionably recalling the manipulations of space and perspective in the Zen gardens of Kyoto and the geometric sculptures in the observatory in Jaipur. At the same time, he was thinking of the ways in which the sets he designed as a young man for theatrical stages had, through clever lighting and placement, made a constricted space seem vast.

Rudd's past -- which includes leading the 1968 student occupation of Columbia University and several years in the bomb-planting revolutionary cadre called the Weather Underground -- may seem alien to his students, but they keep on looking. A portion of the audience for the film (directed by Sam Green and Bill Siegel) and for a rash of recent books about the underground radicals of the 60's and 70's consists of people who were there then. But a generation of writers and artists who are too young to remember, or who can barely remember, the Days of Rage protest, the Weather Underground's bombings of the Capitol and the Pentagon, or the increasingly lethal activities of various splinter groups, also finds the subject alluring.",2003-11-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Necking It Down,"Alexander Haig was the last four-star general to run for a presidential nomination. His campaign introduced two military locutions to political discourse: one was nuancal, ''subtly shaded,'' which did not last. But I still hear the useful phrasal verb to snake-check, which many veterans know means ''to examine closely.'' Before closing down his campaign headquarters, Al explained its origin: when awakening from a night out on bivouac, a soldier must snake-check his boots, which may have provided a warm home for a small snake during the night. To this day, candidates with military backgrounds like to say to aides, ''Have you snake-checked this speech?''",2003-11-30T05:00:00+0000

us,The Shape of Jackets to Come,"Olivier Theyskens, a 26-year-old Belgian designer, is renowned for a kind of High Goth, Marie Antoinette meets Morticia Addams sensibility, and when he received a call from the house of Rochas in early 2002, he was a little surprised. Rochas was a lost fashion name, a company known mostly for the creation of the gupire (a long-line girdle that smoothed the curves of women like Marlene Dietrich) and, more enduringly, for creating perfume that arrived in a pale pink box decorated in black lace. Although Rochas had made clothes since 1990, they were not distinctive. ''When they phoned to ask me if I was interested in the job,'' Theyskens (pronounced THIGH-skins) said, calling from his atelier in Paris, ''I remembered the perfume and its box. I have a passionate relationship with black lace. My grandmother, who is French, would collect black lace for me as a child. I would save it. And now I wonder if my interest started with her Rochas box. I think I have that box in my distant memory.''",2003-11-30T05:00:00+0000

Silver, Hollywood's top-grossing producer, likens the work on Auldbrass to one of his big-budget action pictures (''Lethal Weapon,'' ''Die Hard,'' ''The Matrix'' and their many offspring). Like a movie, a restoration begins with an idea set to paper, and after ''a process fraught with negotiation, problems, compromise and tremendous budget and cost issues, becomes something that lasts forever.''",2003-11-30T05:00:00+0000
