(13) BILLY PORTER: BROADWAY AND SOUL Mr. Porter  who won several awards as the drag queen Lola, above, in the Broadway musical Kinky Boots  performs jazz-inflected standards from the American Songbook in this Live From Lincoln Center presentation. As he transformed Take the Moment, an obscure song from the Richard Rodgers-Stephen Sondheim musical Do I Hear a Waltz?, into a pop-gospel plea, his performance created the kind of epiphany that a great voice can conjure out of thin air, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. The key lay not only in Mr. Porters innate vocal power but also in his commitment to shoot the moon, no matter the consequences. But the evenings coup was his reinvention of Sunday, from Sunday in the Park With George, as a church anthem, fusing Broadway and gospel traditions. It was the kind of juxtaposition that probably only Mr. Porter could have pulled off, Mr. Holden added, and it struck deep.

us,Borecore,"The Vine videos that rise to the top of the heap typically feature dance routines, quick-cut pranks and the occasional clever stop-motion short. But if you tap into the video-sharing apps raw fire hose, a different picture emerges. For example, VPeeker  a site that provides an unending stream of recent Vine uploads  reveals that buried beneath those popular Vines lies a less visible but more intriguing trend: six-second displays of normalcy. Rather than killing time at the mall, in a Spencers Gifts or the food court, young people are filming themselves doing the incredibly mundane: goofing around in a backyard pool, lounging on basement couches, whatever; in other words, recording the minutiae of their lives and uploading it for not very many to see. New services are stepping in too, offering the immediacy Vine cannot. Theres Meerkat, which lets people broadcast video feeds from their phones of what theyre doing at any particular moment. Theres YouNow, which is like Meerkat but primarily the domain of teenagers, who use it to stream video of themselves, bored, at home, in their bedrooms. (For now, its totally innocent.) A cynic might dismiss all this obsessive self-documentation as evidence of generational narcissism, but you could just as easily choose to view it as a developing global pastime. Call it borecore: the never-to-be-viral output that comes from mixing powerful devices and a lifetime of social-media training with regular, old teenage boredom. Seen this way, its predecessors are more prosaic than pathological: doodling in a composition notebook, making scrapbooks, driving around aimlessly. But that simplicity, that sameness, can feel magical when you binge on it: a series of furtive glimpses into the lives of people across the country and around the world doing a whole lot of nothing.

By the time he reaches for the mouthwash, hes revealed himself to be homophobic, sexist and bigoted, although 62-year-old Phillip believes that his ravishing (and 26-year-old) Iranian wife, Shirin, gets him off the hook on that last count. Hes also indignant. Its 1989, and while his most famous work, a play about miners called The Pit and Its Men, is still read in schools, Prys knows his manly style is going out of vogue. Instead, people are reading posh namby-pamby gossamer, half of it written by women like Angela bloody Carter.",2015-04-03T15:16:37+0000

us,James Hannahams Delicious Foods,"When readers first meet Eddie, one of the principal characters in James Hannahams much anticipated second novel, he is struggling to steer a stolen vehicle out of Louisiana and north up Interstate 45, to where hes told his aunt and longtime protector now lives, in St. Cloud, Minn., a place whose very name sounds to him like heaven after the hell he has just endured. Eddie has no hands. How exactly he came to have them severed, a final act of desperation in a novel singularly focused on desperate acts, isnt revealed until the end. But one thing becomes brutally apparent from the start: Eddies mother, Darlene, is overtaken by drug addiction born out of grief over the early, violent death of Eddies black activist father, Nat  and her clouded judgment leads to any number of miseries for herself and her son. When she is tempted in her stupor into a van and into a contract with a company called Delicious Foods, which also gives the novel its title, she is secreted away to a camp where she is forced to work, in order to pay off the debt of her room and food and the diet of crack cocaine overseers use to keep their slave laborers subdued. The drug so utterly annihilates Darlenes autonomy that it speaks for her, narrating her portions of the novel as Scotty  a sinister, wiseass monologuist who often sounds like a cross between Katt Williams and the Devil himself.",2015-04-03T15:17:20+0000

At the age of 43, upon learning that her common law husband of 14 years had secretly married a 22-year-old actress, Eleanor took poison and died. Had her father, Karl Marx, been alive he would have been not only distressed by her death but, I think, dismayed that a daughter of his could not surmount this level of betrayal, for the sake of international socialism if nothing else.",2015-04-03T15:17:50+0000
us,Inside the List,"The Reformer: At least since the frenzied days after 9/11, some pundits have called on moderate Muslims to criticize the more extreme elements of their faith from within. Ayaan Hirsi Ali would seem to fit the bill: Born in Somalia to a Muslim family, she fled to the Netherlands rather than submit to a forced marriage, and has since been vocal in chastising radical Islam for its embrace of violence as well as its treatment of women, gay people and nonbelievers; in short, shed like to see Islam evolve to become more secular and ecumenical. (She outlined much of this agenda, along with her life story, in the 2007 book Infidel, which spent seven months on the hardcover and paperback nonfiction lists.) So its been interesting to see just how polarizing Hirsi Ali  whose new book, Heretic, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No.8  has turned out to be. A professed liberal, she applied for work with left-leaning think tanks when she moved to America in 2007, but found no takers. They didnt say it to my face, but I got the feeling that they were uncomfortable with what I had been saying about Islam, she told the author Sam Harris last year. Instead she found a home with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which seems at peace with her message that Islam is a religion of war. Muslims regard any insult to the Prophet or the Quran as deserving the ultimate penalty, she writes in Heretic  which makes the case for an Islamic Reformation  and this is not an extreme position. To her critics, Hirsi Ali may lack nuance: In fighting fervor with fervor, she can seem less like a moderate Muslim than an immoderate anti-Muslim. (In fact, as she explained in Infidel, she is now an atheist.) Then again, lack of nuance has never hurt a books success. Isnt that part of Hirsi Alis argument, after all?",2015-04-03T15:18:32+0000

Their performances are not exactly subtle  nothing in The Lunchbox is exactly subtle  but they are graceful and dignified in the manner of movie stars in an earlier, less aggressive age, ennobling the ordinary lives they explore.

Judge Marc T. Treadwell also asked Georgia corrections officials to produce all communications  emails, correspondence, messages, etc.  regarding Ms. Diamonds transfer several weeks ago to Georgia State Prison. Ms. Diamond alleges that the transfer, to a prison with a relatively high prevalence of sexual violence, was apparently retaliatory for her lawsuit against corrections officials. Ms. Diamond, 36, is a nonviolent offender and first-time inmate who has lived as a transgender woman since adolescence, but has been held in prisons for men, most of them high-security, for the last three years. She claims in her lawsuit to have suffered at least seven sexual assaults as well as routine sexual coercion and harassment. In addition to safer housing, her lawsuit, filed in February, seeks access to the hormone therapy that is essential medical care for her gender dysphoria. She had been taking hormones for 17 years, she says, until the prison system denied her access. A Georgia corrections spokeswoman saidon Mondaythat Ms. Diamond has been receiving the appropriate treatment assessed by Georgia Correction Health medical staff since March. This is apparently a reference to a hormone patch given to her in response to her lawsuit. ",2015-04-07T00:26:08+0000

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the use of such contraceptives at clinics that receive federal money under the Title X program, which focuses on low-income adults and teenagers. About eight million young women ages 15 to 19 sought birth control at the clinics from 2005 to 2013. At the beginning of the study period, just 0.4 percent, or about 4,000, were using long-term birth control. By 2013, the researchers reported, that had risen to 7 percent, or about 40,000 teenagers. Federal officials say that although long-acting birth control is by far the most effective method, its use among women over all still lags, and they are encouraging providers to take steps to increase the numbers.

And so one thing led to another, and a new series of limited-edition rugs and other decorative items, debuting Monday at Shop Cooper Hewitt, was born. The five rug styles ($1,675 each) and three pillow designs ($105 each), hand-dyed and -loomed in the Uttar Pradesh region of northern India, take cues from Kurdish weaving motifs and early Internet graphics, and feature hand-knotting techniques that make them look, Proba says, more 3D than they actually are. Many are asymmetrical, like the designs in Probas poster series: Thats one of the reasons I was excited about her work, because you have to work at looking at it, Oudghiri explains. Thats a huge tenet of rug weaving; you keep things asymmetrical as a form of humility because you dont want to compete with God.

She repeats the song as she snuggles up to her child through his childhood and teenage years, and even when he is a grown man.

He was an explorer, an inventor, a man in perpetual inquitude regarding the cinematographic form, remarks Serge Toubiana, the director of the Cinmathque, which is also hosting a complete filmic retrospective running through May 31. Toubiana cites the sense of narrative shock, aesthetic shock Antonioni brought to cinema  whether featuring a fashion photographer modeled on David Bailey in the swinging London of Blow Up or casting the exquisite Monica Vitti in a trio of films (LAvventura, La Notte, LEclisse) about indefinable human malaise. Although never quite celebrated or completely understood in his native Italy, he won accolades internationally, some of which are displayed in the exhibition, including a Palme dOr from 1967, and an honorary Oscar from 1995 (represented by a mislabeled replica, as the original was stolen during a burglary).",2015-04-08T20:45:19+0000

Instead, she aims to distinguish her work by highlighting its natural synergy with the human anatomy. In her latest designs (she doesnt create collections), the former art scholar and sculptor is taking that notion, of connecting the accessory to its wearer, even further. Today at Dover Street Market New York, she debuts collar necklaces, earrings, rings and bracelets made from materials like yellow gold, pav diamonds and pearls. I was inspired by a dialogue with the human form, Khouri says. The shapes of these pieces follow the lines of the body. There are cuffs that appear to climb inside the ear and slink their way out of the lobe, and rings that better frame the curves of the fingers. Inspired by artists like Louise Bourgeois and Alberto Giacometti, Khouri explains that she aims to call attention to the lines of the thing  and not the person who is wearing it. To that effect, the DSMNY installation features live models, veiled and wearing the pieces over their fabric-draped skin  so that viewers only, as Khouri puts it, focus only on what is essential.",2015-04-09T18:10:22+0000

He then went to the office of a bankruptcy judge and killed him, they said. The officials said they believed that the judge, Fernando Ciampi, had been involved in the bankruptcy case. Another man was shot in the leg. In all, Mr. Giardiello fired 13 shots, they said. He acted with cold premeditation, said Tommaso Buonanno, a prosecutor. Mr. Giardiello fled on a scooter but was arrested later in Vimercate, about 19 miles from Milan, where, the police said, he had intended to kill at least one other person. It was unclear how Mr. Giardiello managed to carry a gun into the courthouse. He may have entered through a separate entrance for lawyers and court employees using a false ID, officials said.

In the town of Rochelle, a tornado was said to have struck a restaurant called Grubsteakers, trapping 14 people inside the collapsed building, according to The Daily Chronicle, a newspaper in DeKalb.

us,David Treuers Prudence,"The poetics of damage permeates David Treuers elegantly bitter fourth novel, Prudence, which unites a distinctly modern sociopolitical perspective with a more old-fashioned moral rigor about the consequences of emotional cowardice, complicity and repression. On the evidence here, Treuer believes in bravery. Moreover, he believes that a lack of bravery isnt just sad, its deeply destructive  and the destruction cant be undone. Cowardice can kill people. While theres much hope in this lyrical novel, as evidenced by the freedom with which it examines some of the more transgressive interstices of race, sexual orientation and gender, theres also an obdurate insistence on taking responsibility, particularly if one is a man. Treuers perspective is bracingly tough. This author values honor. Who dares to take that kind of stance anymore?",2015-04-10T12:00:08+0000

Before the first chapter is over, the narrator, the master impressionist Giovanni Bernini, remembers deducing from the interior mystery of his mothers eyes how much she hated the rules of bodies, that one person could be only one and that certain spaces would always separate us; in a quiet classroom he hears the mouse noise of pencils; of his work selling train tickets, which he experiences as a satisfying daily masquerade, he observes, It carried on past dinner when I read a popular novel in bed and would live on soon enough, I hoped, in a house of my own populated by a ticket sellers wife and ticket sellers children, a family who would kiss and be kissed by me and who would never meet, as long as they lived, the heaps of sleeping strangers inside their man.

us,New Mexico: Governor Signs Bill on Civil Forfeiture,"Gov. Susana Martinez signed a bill Friday virtually ending the practice of civil forfeiture, making the state a leader in sharply restricting a contentious policy that critics say deprives citizens of due process and gives law enforcement a profit motive. This is landmark legislation to protect peoples property and due process rights, said Lee McGrath, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian civil rights group that has long campaigned against the practice. The law preserves criminal forfeiture, in which assets tied to crime can be taken if the owner is convicted. In a letter to lawmakers, Governor Martinez said the law improved constitutional protections even as she said that forfeiture funds had helped in keeping our communities safe and in protecting our officers from harm. Only one other state, North Carolina, does not permit civil forfeiture, but law enforcement officials there can still profit from forfeitures by cooperating with federal agents, Mr. McGrath said. The New Mexico law seeks to end such profit-sharing in cases where the assets are valued at less than $50,000. Civil forfeiture, in which law enforcement officials can take possession of property they believe is tied to criminal activity without filing charges or winning a conviction, has come under fire as abuses have been widely chronicled in the news media and the federal government has taken steps to curb the process.

Ms. Tijoux was born in France to Chilean parents who had fled the Pinochet dictatorship; she moved to Chile after democracy was restored. Her songs reach from personal experience toward social concerns, and theyre calmly assertive, never strident. The music traverses the Americas, from old school hip-hop to Andean flutes, and Ms. Tijouxs tough-minded rhymes lead into lilting choruses. This week she plays three New York shows: two headlining club dates and a third as part of Gracias a la Vida: The Rebel Spirit of Chiles Legendary Voice, a tribute to the crusading folklorist and songwriter Violeta Parra that is starting a United States tour. Ms. Tijoux shares the bill with the traditionalist Andean group Ilapu and with Colombina Parra, a punk-influenced niece of Violeta Parra. (Friday, 7:30 p.m., Paces Schimmel Center, 212-346-1715.

In 2000, Ms. Trevi, Mr. Andrade and a backup singer were arrested in Rio de Janeiro on charges of corrupting minors, sexual abuse and kidnapping. ",2015-04-11T22:18:10+0000

(Starz) THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon received an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for this political drama, which Mr. Clooney also directed and stars in as Mike Morris, a Pennsylvania governor turned dream candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ryan Gosling plays Stephen Meyers, a strategist who becomes involved with an intern (Evan Rachel Wood) with a powerful father and a secret that could derail Stephens career and the Morris campaign. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are advisers battling for Stephens loyalty. And Marisa Tomei is a reporter trying to get at the truth. Mr. Clooney handles the plot complications with elegant dexterity, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this adaptation of Mr. Willimons play Farragut North, loosely based on Howard Deans 2004 presidential primary campaign. As an actor he works best in long, understated scenes that allow him to play with nuances of charm and menace, so it is not surprising that, as a director, he gives the rest of the cast room to work, Mr. Scott added. But the parts of The Ides of March  quiet scenes between Mr. Gosling and Ms. Wood; swirling, Sorkin-esque exchanges of banter; any time Ms. Tomei or Max Minghella (as a campaign worker grooming himself to be the next Stephen Meyers) are in the room  are greater than the whole.",2015-04-14T05:00:06+0000

(HBO2) THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005) In this political thriller directed by Fernando Meirelles and adapted from the John le Carr novel, Ralph Fiennes portrays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat (and diligent caretaker of his plants), and Rachel Weisz is Tessa, his wife, whom he meets during a lecture on foreign policy when she angrily challenges Britains participation in the Iraq war. Throughout most of the movie Tessa is shown in flashbacks; she has been murdered in the Kenyan wilderness, where she traveled with a Belgian doctor of African ancestry (Hubert Kound) to help fight poverty and disease. Danny Huston plays Justins colleague, and Bill Nighy is a villain in this tale about the evils lurking in multinational corporations and the Western governments that enable them.

Apparently she came in to our department to declare how happy she was to find $50 the previous day, and felt her luck was finally turning around. The timing of her coming into the bathroom was exact. My colleague said she was about to tell her she might know the moneys owner, but felt she did not want to spoil the womans happiness.

Feig gave McCarthy a breakthrough ensemble role in Bridesmaids (2011) and later cast her opposite Sandra Bullock in The Heat (2013). In Spy, McCarthy is the star, playing an unlikely secret agent called Susan Cooper. In Scene 114, Susan has been apprehended and dumped in the basement alongside another captive, named Aldo  a disconcertingly libidinal ally who keeps hitting on Susan despite their dire circumstances. The scene builds toward some exquisitely clumsy physical comedy, as Susan commands Aldo to help untie her, even though he is also in knots, inaugurating a grabby ballet and creating numerous opportunities for Aldo to say sleazy things.",2015-04-15T11:00:20+0000

us,Ryan Sullivan Scales Up,"The young painter Ryan Sullivan makes the type of ethereal drip abstractions one might expect to require a three-page pamphlet for explanation; but in fact, most of his descriptions are simple. Thats not an insult  quite the contrary. Sullivan speaks of his practice with sharp, fine-tuned language. Im trying to deal with these parameters that Ive set in front of me and the event of making this thing, says the 32-year-old Rhode Island School of Design graduate. Theres something closely linked between the image that you see, the process of making it and the material. Theres nothing else. Theres no subject matter tacked on top of that, its much more about how closely those things can be bound together. This week, Sullivan opens his first solo and American institutional exhibition at Miamis Institute of Contemporary Art  the institution founded by former employees of the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, thats lately been closely watched in the art world after its recent move to the Design District (on the second floor of the charming 1912 Moore building) and appointment of a not-yet-30-year-old deputy director and chief curator (Alex Gartenfeld, a former Art in America editor).",2015-04-16T21:25:51+0000

In 1959, a group of formerly true-believing Romanian Communists, all Jewish, did the unthinkable when they robbed a branch of the state (and only) bank. They were soon caught, but the story went from curious to crackpot when officials decided that the robbers would portray themselves in a state-produced film titled Reconstruction, recreating their gangsta roles with secret meetings, gats and getaway cars. Apparently believing that the state might go easier on them if they cooperated, the robbers played along, all the way through the show-trial end.",2015-04-16T21:35:22+0000

In the 1980s, the neighborhood soaked up some of the limelight trained on the East Village art scene, and began the slow creep toward gentrification. A decade or so ago, when art dealers started to set up shop below East Houston Street, a vague hope beat in the hearts of some observers that the neighborhood might be an alternative, in art and attitude alike, to Chelsea. I doubt anyone harbors that hope today. Mostly, the Lower East Side gallery scene is Chelsea with more storefronts and cheaper retail.

(Starz Cinema) FOOTNOTE (2012) The tension-filled relationship between rival Talmudic scholars  Eliezer (Shlomo Bar Aba, above), who toils in obscurity under the belief that his career was blocked by a nemesis, and Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi), an academic star with a busy schedule of public lectures  becomes more complicated when Eliezer is mistakenly awarded a coveted prize meant for Uriel, who happens to be his son. But how to correct the error? Under the direction of Joseph Cedar, the American-born Israeli director, the fraught relations between father and son erupt into an intergenerational tsimmes worthy of Shakespeare, Freud or the more melodramatic portions of the Hebrew Bible, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. It plays as farce, but the chords of family tragedy resonate underneath the laughter. Resolution, he added, is unlikely, which may or may not be cause for optimism. Academic life and family life are both built on love  the love of learning, the love of other people  but they survive on contention, renewing and extending quarrels from one generation to the next.",2015-04-17T05:00:07+0000

At the high end, Edwards once settled at $10 million to secure the release of 26 crew members aboard an oil tanker held by Somali pirates, but he has also freed a detainee in Afghanistan for less than $10,000. A counteroffer to the first ransom demands should be a result of exhaustive research. You dont need to know their names, but you need to know their modus operandi and their track record, Edwards says. Whether the hostage-takers motives are purely mercenary or derive from a more dangerous mix of ideology, politics and greed, this is not the time to be a cheapskate.

Now I have an idea, after reading Rust, which is one of those books that examine the fabric of our material world and pick at its scabs. It is a book about what is corroding away unseen and unnoticed by most of us. The heroes and antiheroes in this account of cans exploding, bridges collapsing and buildings falling apart are the engineers and corrosion experts who are either saving us all from oblivion or pushing paranoia. Jonathan Waldman, an environmental journalist, is an outsider coolly detached from this debate, although clearly fascinated by the people involved, and this is one of the main strengths of the book.",2015-04-17T13:39:04+0000

us,Inside the List,"Northern Lights: With a population of 5.1 million people, Norway has fewer residents than New York City  and, by the look of things these days, more writers than Brooklyn. This is their moment in the midnight sun: Our cover next week will feature new books by Karl Ove Knausgaard, Per Petterson and Asne Seierstad, while Jo Nesbo turns up at No.9 on the hardcover fiction list with his latest crime novel, Blood on Snow. Nesbo is of course a regular on the best-seller pages, thanks to his Harry Hole mystery series, but Blood on Snow  about a 1970s hit man who falls in love with his target  is a stand-alone. It was inspired, Nesbo has said, by his desire to do for Oslo what Jim Carroll did for New York in The Basketball Diaries: He makes Manhattan feel dangerous but also small, Nesbo told The Yorkshire Post earlier this month. Any big city will have its darker side, its inevitable, and Oslo is no different. ... On the other hand my Oslo is a little bit more twisted and darker, a bit like Gotham City is a darker version of New York. Nesbo is often grouped with the Swedish writers Stieg Larsson and Henning Mankell as exemplars of a recent wave of Nordic noir, but he told the newspaper hes at a loss to explain the phenomenon: People ask me, What is it with Scandinavian crime fiction? And Ive been trying to come up with a smart answer, but I really dont know.",2015-04-17T14:00:06+0000

The Swiss canton of Neuchtel, it was disclosed today [April 19], has issued a decree barring the capture, transport and sale of snails. Since most Swiss have a pronounced aversion to snails  on the dinner table, anyway the new law is interpreted here as a riposte against the neighboring French department of the Doubs. Snail, smothered in garlic butter and baked, are a favorite dish of the French, and the people of the Doubs are accused of crossing the border to hunt for the escargots that the Swiss dont use. Police have been authorized to search cars, suitcases and gamebags for contraband snails. Smugglers run the risk of having not only their booty but also their cars seized.

In Winters Tale (2014), at 12:45 p.m. on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe plays a gangster in early- 20th-century New York intent on putting asunder the love between a consumptive rich girl (Jessica Brown Findlay) and a thief (Colin Farrell). A thin line separates the magical from the preposterous, and by insisting so strenuously on its own magic, Winters Tale pitches helplessly into earnest ridiculousness, Mr. Scott wrote about this adaptation by Akiva Goldsman of Mark Helprins best seller. And in A Good Year (2006), at 2:45 on HBO Signature, Mr. Crowe portrays Max Skinner, an aggressive London bond trader who inherits a small vineyard from his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney). Soon enough, Max, soothed by the memories of summers spent amid the grapevines, has morphed into a bon vivant and fallen for a beautiful bistro owner (Marion Cotillard). Then a young Californian (Abbie Cornish) shows up and announces that she is his uncles previously unknown daughter  which would make her Henrys true heir. In his review of this Ridley Scott adaptation of the Peter Mayle novel, Stephen Holden advised viewers to make a reservation at an upscale French restaurant immediately after seeing the film or risk going home feeling deprived.",2015-04-20T05:00:05+0000

There arent many writers on politics who will study emotional intelligence as closely as they do polls, and fewer still extol failure as enthusiastically as they do success. Brookss flaws, as he tells us with typical cheerfulness and ease at the beginning of his new book, are that I was born with a natural disposition toward shallowness and Im paid to be a narcissistic blowhard (the admission itself, of course, taking some of the edge off that narcissistic). He is, in short, a near-ideal public commentator (for this paper and for many other media outlets) because he is happy to sacrifice complexity and nuance in order to spin a hyper-readable, lucid, often richly detailed human story that sounds far less shrill and ad hominem than most of the polarizing rants of the day.",2015-04-20T09:30:05+0000

(Flix) THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (2002) Four Roman Catholic Irish teenagers (Anne-Marie Duff; Dorothy Duffy; Nora-Jane Noone; and Eileen Walsh) are sentenced in the late 1960s to toil in convent laundries run by the Sisters of the Magdalene as punishment for sexual misconduct in this semifictional story. (The existence of these religious labor camps, which 30,000 women are thought to have endured, came to light in the 70s with the discovery of the unmarked graves of some who lived there; the last laundry was closed in 1996.) Geraldine McEwan plays Sister Bridget, the twisted head nun  with a soft spot for The Bells of St. Marys and John F. Kennedy  who turns into a demon if her rules are flouted. The Magdalene Sisters would be too painful to watch if it didnt have a silver lining, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, which was written and directed by Peter Mullan and won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival.

Your progress is not a line, direct or winding, from one point to another, but a flickering series of scenes. A street is not only its tarred surface, the buildings alongside it, the cars fast or slow, the people around you. It is also the way those things relate to one another, the way they combine and recombine. As some elements slip out of view, new ones become visible: You are moving, the cars are moving, other people are moving, even the sun is moving, slowly, and in the middle of this movable feast you must decide when to press the shutter, decide which of these rapidly refreshing instants is more interesting than the others around it.

But I wasnt allowed to ride the train. It took a half-hour to walk to the subway stop, and youd have to walk through Canarsie  ungentrifiable, unimprovable Canarsie  past a lot of questionable landmarks. There was the convenience store where my mother sent me to buy Kents, and whose clerk would ask if Id like a lighter, then offer me one with a photo of a naked lady on it.

In those early days, my wife, Eileen, and I discovered that despite all there was to do in the city on Saturday nights, the thing we liked most was to stay home and cook for each other. We owned two cookbooks; the one we favored was Northern Italian Cooking, by Francesco Ghedini (an intensely serious cookbook whose heartsick, newly widowed author committed suicide before completing it). Our favorite Ghedini recipes were heavy on pork sausages. If you were going to buy pork, that meant you went to Espositos pork shop on Ninth Avenue and 38th. You went nowhere else. So on Saturday afternoons, I would start at our apartment and walk south, entering Riverside Park on 107th, crossing over on 96th and then continuing in the park all the way down to 72nd.

(Showtime) BOYHOOD (2014) Starting in 2002, Richard Linklater began to film four characters  a boy (Ellar Coltrane), then 6; his sister (Lorelei Linklater, Mr. Linklaters daughter); and their parents (the Oscar-winning Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke, in a nominated role)  over 12 consecutive years, composing the script as the movie progressed. What emerged from those dozen years is a series of meticulously textured and structured scenes set to the rhythm of life, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Siblings argue. A mother struggles with men, paying the bills and earning several college degrees. An estranged father roars into his childrens lives in a 1968 GTO. The story in Boyhood is blissfully simple: A child grows up, Ms. Dargis added about this film, which also earned Oscar nominations for best picture, directing, original screenplay and editing. This, along with the modesty of its physical production  its humble rooms, quiet moments, ordinary lives  can obscure Mr. Linklaters ambitions and the greatness of his achievement. But in his masterpiece, she said, he both captures moments in time and relinquishes them as he moves from year to year. He isnt fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty.",2015-04-25T05:00:05+0000

But the work of photography-based painters like Chantal Joffe (her early interest in nudes led her to paint mostly from pictures in pornographic magazines) has always existed somewhere in between, a fictive nonfiction. Starting Friday, the Jewish Museum will present 34 new portraits by Ms. Joffe of Jewish women of the 20th century whose contributions to art, literature and politics have interested her. The redoubtable group includes Sontag, as well as Diane Arbus, Gertrude Stein and Claude Cahun, the Surrealist shape-shifter whose photographic self-portraits as a man, amid many other guises, prefigured Cindy Sherman by decades. Ms. Joffe made the portraits after immersing herself not only in pictures of the women but also in what they wrote and made, striving for depictions charged with her own imagining of what her heroes would have looked like at various stages of their lives.

The country was becoming steadily citified, and Bellow  born outside Montreal, raised in Chicago, at home in Manhattan  was the laureate of the new urban cosmos. Mr. Bellow has something like a genius for place, V.S. Pritchett marveled in The New York Review of Books. There is not a descriptive insinuator of what a city like New York is like from minute to minute who comes anywhere near him. Some novelists stage it, others document it; he is breathing in it. The big ideas and Great Books blurtings of Moses Herzog, a cuckolded professor and poor soldier of culture who goes on a half-crazed letter-writing spree (Dear Doktor Professor Heidegger), bounce like molecules off the shifting surfaces and bristling planes of Manhattan: the crowded sidewalks and pinched apartments, the humps of brown rock speckled with mica in Central Park, glimpsed between the blinds of an Upper West Side doctors office whose dark walls seemed swollen with the disease of old buildings in New York. Dropping his subway fare in the slot, Herzog sees a whole series of tokens lighted from within and magnified by the glass and notes that innumerable millions of passengers had polished the wood of the turnstile with their hips. In Bellows urban pastoral, mass human activity both exhilarates and terrifies, duplicating natures impersonal patterned randomness  as megatons of water shape organisms on the ocean floor. As tides polish stones. As winds hollow cliffs.",2015-04-27T09:30:14+0000

Go and tear some tissue paper in two, slowly: It sounds just like the sullen purr of bristling vermin. But how, you wonder, did Bellow know what torn tissue paper sounded like in the first place? And then you wonder what this minutely vigilant detail is doing in Holiday magazine (in 1957), rather than in the work in progress, Henderson the Rain King (1959). It or something even better probably is in Henderson. For Bellows fictional and nonfictional voices intertwine and cross-pollinate. This is from a film review of 1962: There she is, stout and old, a sinking, squarish frame of bones.

The African-American ever feels his or her two-ness, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body. Segregation placed a veil between the black observer and that other world, the white one. DuBoiss description of the black individual who is yet American remained apt into the era of increased integration, as shown in various autobiographies that began to appear in the 1990s by young black people who had entered the middle class. The experience of an elite school or a profession was understood as a leaving of the black world. Now we are hearing from the children of those black parents who rent the veil. For them, the Huxtable generation, whiteness may no longer be synonymous with what it is to be American or normal, but to be black still means knowing how to survive on what DuBois elsewhere identified as the island within.",2015-04-28T09:30:06+0000

The suit, filed Monday, came a few days after Armenia officially commemorated the centennial of the genocide. ",2015-04-29T02:06:10+0000

For Deep South (2005), she photographed the Southern landscape so dear to her, exposing its extravagant beauty and its haunting past. And with 2009s Proud Flesh, Mann turned her eye towards her husband of over four decades, in a candid portrait series revealing his once-powerful body, now marked by signs of age and muscular dystrophy; at once a love letter and a testament to times merciless passage.

The officials said the vessel was owned by a corporate defendant in a civil case in Iran. They denied that the impoundment had been meant to send a belligerent message to other nations over freedom of navigation in the strait. Thats a legal case, said Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. This is not a security issue or political issue. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying the action had been taken in conformity with international regulations. Some analysts in the United States said the seizure reflected what they called Irans desire to show it would not be bullied. Last week, the United States deployed warships near Yemens coast, in what was seen as a message to Iranian vessels in the area. ",2015-04-30T01:53:32+0000

I have tried referring to this period as medical disability leave, but that hasnt changed the general perception that I will be loafing around. Any ideas?",2015-04-30T23:03:16+0000
us,"Days of Grace, a Mexican Film by Everardo Gout","Days of Grace, the debut feature from Everardo Gout, a Mexican filmmaker with a background in music videos and television commercials, weaves together three stories of violence and corruption in Mexico City. Braided narratives are a way for directors both to show off their chops and to illuminate social issues and complex themes. Mr. Gout combines a slick, kinetic style with a somber ethical sense. His movie is flashy and entertaining, but also earnestly concerned with the collapse of trust and integrity at every level of society.",2015-04-30T23:07:18+0000

us,"Review: In Far From Men, a Teacher Caught in the Crossfire","In Far From Men, Viggo Mortensen, his sharply planed face weathered and solemn, plays a man who looks as if he were quarried right out of the hard red-rock earth. He plays Daru, a teacher who imparts the names of French rivers to eager Algerian children in a small white schoolhouse thats nestled in a valley and ringed by jagged desert mountains. Theres something haunted about this wildly beautiful place with its thirsty ground and sparse vegetation, though only partly because the story takes place in 1954, the year the fight for Algerian independence ignited.

us,"Review: In Hyena, a Rogue Cop Finds Himself in Too Deep","Hyena, Gerard Johnsons corrupt-cop drama, is the kind of gory British policier from which you come away with the queasy feeling that the world is essentially a butcher shop ruled by greed, murder, cruelty and lust. American equivalents like Bad Lieutenant at least have a moral compass, however twisted. British crime films in a similar mode (Im thinking particularly of Filth) begin from the Hobbesian presumption that, as Mick Jagger sings in Sympathy for the Devil, every cop is a criminal.",2015-04-30T23:30:39+0000

But the mild style that the filmmaker Bruce LaBruce slips on for his new feature is that of tastefully observed indie romance, flavored with a sweetly droll sense of humor but never to the point of undermining the sincerity of its intentions.",2015-04-30T23:57:22+0000

The morning-line odds were set by Mike Battaglia of Churchill Downs. (Note: International Star, who was to start from the No. 12 post, was scratched Saturday morning with a hoof issue. Frammento, an alternate entry who will wear saddle No. 21, was added to the field after the scratch of Stanford, who was to start from the No. 11 post. The horses will keep their program numbers but the first hole in the gate will be left open and each will move down a gate. For example, No. 1 Ocho Ocho Ocho will break from the second post but still be considered as breaking from Post 1.)",2015-04-30T23:59:38+0000
