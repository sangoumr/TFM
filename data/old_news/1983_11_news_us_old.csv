Mr. Alfonsin received 52 percent of the vote to 40 percent for the Peronist, Italo Luder. Ten smaller parties split the balance. (Page A1, Column 6.)

us,"HEROES, VILLAINS AND WARY TEXTBOOK PUBLISHERS","HOW will Martin Luther King Jr. be treated in future high school history texts? Gingerly, if the record of American textbooks is any indication. How will Senator Joseph R. McCarthy be treated in future high school history texts? Noncommittally, if current scholarly revisionism of his career is any indication. These questions arise at a time when the social studies curriculum is under scrutiny. For example, the New York State Education Department has suggested putting greater stress in the teaching of history on sociological, political and economic issues instead of on the more traditional chronological approach. But many critics of the way history is taught feel that the major obstacle to creating an accurate picture of the past is overt or covert interference by partisans who prevent textbook publishers from dealing forthrightly with vital figures and ideas because they are afraid of controversy. Such fear also intimidates teachers. In its recent report on the high schools, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching pointed out that 17 states use centralized selection of textbooks for all students in all schools. To lose sales in those states is a matter of serious concern to publishers. Therefore, the foundation says, ''most textbooks present students with a highly simplified view of reality.'' In her analysis of history texts, ''America Revised,'' Frances FitzGerald observed that textbooks ''have become the lightning rods of American society,'' exposed to the wrath of special interest groups. Quite naturally, therefore, controversial ideas are often expunged.",1983-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,JAPAN'S CAR MAKERS ARE SENT A MESSAGE,"The House sent a strong protest signal to Japan and its auto makers by passing a ''domestic content'' bill on imported automobiles for the second year in a row. Despite a gesture by Japan earlier in the week of agreeing to new import quotas, the legislation passed on a 219-to-199 vote. If approved by the Senate and signed by President Reagan, the bill would require that most foreign cars sold in this country be built mostly with American parts and labor. But the bill's prospects in the Senate are grim, and are even worse with Mr. Reagan, who has threatened to veto any domestic content legislation. Japanese imports currently hold almost 20 percent of the American market and supporters of the bill see it as a way to create more jobs in this country, as well as open up the Japanese market to more American goods. Opponents fear the protectionist legislation would spark equally strong reactions by United States trade partners. Auto sales continued strong through October, though they have not broken the 7-million- a-year mark. One Merrill Lynch analyst called the pattern ''pretty boring.'' Sales in October were up 25.5 percent for the Big Three, with Ford setting the pace with a 33.5 percent gain.",1983-11-06T05:00:00+0000

When one side of a clock reads 10 o'clock, the other side reads 10:15. Sometimes three clocks in a row are keeping separate times, differing by 5, 15 or 30 minutes.

The comments by senior officials came as Israel and Syria called up reservists and the United States strengthened its naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean. Still, a senior State Department official said that the United States and Israel were concerned and uncertain over the consequences of what he said was ''an increasingly hard line'' on the part of Syria. (Page A1, Column 6.) Israel assured Syria it had no intention of mounting an attack against Syrian forces. Israel has announced plans for a mobilization of its forces later this week, but officials said it was a routine, semiannual maneuver that was ''in no way connected with events in Lebanon.''

Written in Germany during World War II by an opportunist who let himself be used by the Nazis as a cultural exhibit, it has been under a political cloud ever since. Its libretto, a piece of muddled mythology worked up by the pedantic Josef Gregor and painfully hammered into shape by the composer and others, is weak and contorted. The score is incredibly complex and fiercely difficult to sing, representing Strauss in his late, almost too luxuriant mood. His infatuation with his own orchestral technique led him in this work as in others, early and late, to pack in the notes at times when lean simplicity might have been more powerful.",1983-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,MAKING MORE BY TAKING LESS PAY,"When it comes to collecting your paycheck, taking less today can mean more tomorrow. Increasing numbers of workers are joining salary reduction plans, voluntarily taking pay cuts so they can stash the money in tax-sheltered retirement accounts sponsored by their companies. Salary reduction plans - also known as CODA's (for cash-or- deferred arrangements) or 401K plans (for the section of the Tax Code under which they qualify) - are a variation on traditional company thrift plans in which worker contributions are deposited in a company-sponsored investment account. But with conventional plans, workers invest after-tax dollars, while with salary reduction plans they invest pretax money. Under salary reduction plans, workers agree to reduce part of their pay, which their company then invests in, say, a stock or bond fund. There is no current income tax due on the deferred pay, and contributions to the investment account accumulate tax-free until the money is withdrawn when the workers quit or retire. Then they collect their deferred pay, plus accumulated interest, and pay income tax figured at favorable rates. ''They're really pretty wonderful, and are a financially efficient way for employees to invest,'' said Harold Dankner, a partner in the Washington office of the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand. In theory, a salary reduction plan is simple. Say a 35-year-old executive earning $50,000 a year decides to defer $2,500 - 5 percent of his salary - and have it contributed to the tax-sheltered savings plan. The pay shown on his W2 form would drop to $47,500 and the executive would save $885 in Federal income tax, according to the accounting firm Peat, Marwick Mitchell & Co.",1983-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Inflation's continued moderate pace undoubtedly surprised many economists - especially those who expected it to heat up in the aftermath of this summer's drought. Meanwhile, the economy showed little sign of slowing, as consumers kept buying and borrowing. Retail sales rose 1.1 percent in October and consumer installment credit expanded at an annual rate of 7.9 percent. That, plus a welcome drop in interest rates, sent the stock market soaring late in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average gained almost 32 points to close the week at 1,250.20. And the Government's 30-year bond closed with a yield of 11.66 percent.

The program, which is expected to begin next year, is intended to reduce costs. It is also intended to cut the long waits for elective surgery at many of the city's teaching hospitals. Health officials said the program would save public health funds because about 90 percent of all surgery was financed by the public Medicaid program for the poor, by the Medicare program for the elderly and by employee health benefit programs and private insurers, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York. According to Steven Sieverts, head of the program and a Blue Cross Blue Shield vice president, surgeons in participating hospitals will ask ''carefully selected patients'' to volunteer to be discharged earlier than usual or have their surgery done without hospitalization. He estimated that ''thousands'' of patients would agree to take part by the end of the first year. The procedures will include such cases as hernia repairs, removal of gall bladders and the setting of broken bones. Dr. Walter Wichern, head of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which is participating in the program, said shorter hospitalization and outpatient surgery were more feasible now because of improved surgical techniques, more use of localized anesthesia and a new surgical attitude that emphasizes swift ambulatory recovery.",1983-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,WAITING FOR THE BIG BANKS TO REVIVE,"For investors in the big international bank stocks, the possibility of a major loan default by a foreign country is like nuclear war. Both are too horrible to contemplate. Over the summer, with economic crises abounding in South America, the specter of default and the decimating effects on bank capital became all too real. Investors fled and the stocks of the so-called money-center banks in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco took a monumental nose dive. But lately, some big investors have decided that the default fears have gone too far. One of these is Delaware Investment Advisers. In recent weeks, the Philadelphia-based pension fund manager has put $150 million of its $5.5 billion equity portfolio into Citicorp, Chemical Bank, Wells Fargo and a number of other money-center banks. And, as of last week, it was still buying. The rush is on, explained George Deming, vice president, because the big banks are near their historical lows relative to the rest of the market. And, within a matter of weeks, he believes, the Brazilian debt crisis, which sent the group into a tailspin in the first place, is likely to ease. Many of Wall Street's leading analysts also say the big banks are a bargain. ''They are incredibly oversold,'' said Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''The time to worry about defaults was a year ago. Now the International Monetary Fund, the debtor countries and the banks are all pulling on the same oar.''",1983-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Due to a broken gutter downspout, water accumulated on the outside of one wall and seeped through the brick and the plaster, leaving a serious case of mildew on the inside. Also, the plaster is crumbling and coming off in several places where the wall is below the ground level. We plan to patch the plaster in the worst places, then wash the walls with a bleach solution to kill the mildew. After that we thought of applying two coats of a waterproof paint sealer that the manufacturer advertises as being ''warranted for 10 years to waterproof basement and concrete interiors.'' We then plan to paint over this with a stain killer that will cover the mildew stains, then apply a regular interior wall paint. Do you think this will solve our problem?",1983-11-17T05:00:00+0000

From the raw material provided by a study of Braque and Leger, he developed an intensely personal creative vision based on observation of the real world but shaped by subjective and theoretical concepts that transformed what was seen, heard and felt into abstract line, shape, color and rhythm.",1983-11-20T05:00:00+0000
us,SPARE PARTS FOR ARMS CAN COST AN ARM AND A LEG,"A recent Pentagon investigation of spare-parts horror stories showed that the Air Force paid more than $1.4 million early this year for an order of jet engine spares for which the manufacturer had charged only about $530,000. Two commercial firms higher in the Government contracting chain had added almost a million dollars in markups. ''All they did,'' said a middle- level Pentagon official who asked to remain anonymous, ''was place an order for the Air Force; they performed no real function.'' Moreover, there is little likelihood that even the original manufacturer's price was realistic, according to this manager. Not all officials insist on anonymity. A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a high- ranking civil servant and famous whistleblower in the Air Force, said that recent scandals about grossly inflated spare-part prices had been valuable because they involved simple items about which common-sensical members of the public, or Congress, could not be fooled. A $269 wrench, three inches long, or a $900 plastic cup to place under the leg of a flight navigator's stool are obviously absurd, he said. ''The horrible truth, however, is that everything is priced about the same way,'' he said. ''The rip-off of taxpayers on the big items - weapons, engines, aircraft - is as bad as on spares.'' In interviews, five experienced Defense Department auditors expressed the belief that it would be possible to save as much as half of the $84.4 billion set aside in the next Defense budget for procurement, plus more money on other parts of the total $247 billion military spending bill.",1983-11-20T05:00:00+0000

us,STEEL HAS WON A PLACE IN SCULPTURE,"Steel, the underpinning of our industrial age, is a 20th-century newcomer to the repertory of artists' materials. Stone, bronze and wood were the time-honored sculptural basics - that is, until the Spaniard Julio Gonzalez began welding iron in the 1920's, making ''direct metal'' sculpture without the cumbersome casting process of bronze, and later helping Picasso to do the same. Gonzalez wanted a new identity for iron, which he felt had been regarded as ''a murderer or the mere instrument of overmechanized science.'' The way was clear, he said, for it ''to be forged and hammered by the peaceful hands of an artist.'' In this country, David Smith, who - inspired by Picasso - began to weld and bolt steel in the 1930's, became its chief promoter. ''It is structure, movement, progress, suspension, cantilever and at times destruction and brutality,'' he wrote. And today, this macho material is a sculptor's staple, the first industrial substance to be established as a medium for three-dimensional art.",1983-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Concerned that these warmblooded leviathans are within sight of a watery Armageddon, the Canadian poet Greg Gatenby has unearthed and commissioned hundreds of pieces of lore, poetry, paintings, sculpture and music for ''WHALES: A Celebration'' (Little, Brown, $39.95 through Dec. 31; $50 thereafter), rallying them into a lavish artistic tribute to all cetacea. Variously perceived as white goddesses, black roses, emperors, all species of whale and dolphin are here honored by poets, including John Masefield, C. H. Sisson and Maxine Kumin; by writers and scientists from Plutarch to Carl Sagan; by artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Raoul Dufy (woodcut, top right), and by composers such as Leonard Bernstein, Ned Rorem and John Cage. There is a cautionary tale from Margaret Atwood, ''The Afterlife of Ishmael,'' in which Melville's sailor is visited by the god of whales and condemned to everlasting life in his small cottage overlooking a sea bereft of whales. Stanley Kunitz's contribution is ''The Wellfleet Whale,'' a haunting poem about the fate of a beached whale - ''Somebody had carved his initials in your flank. . . . The gulls had been pecking at you. The sound you made was a hoarse and fitful bleating.'' Samples from the classics reecho myths about life in the belly of the beast (from Jonah to Pinocchio), but there are true stories, too. There are also two songs composed in the shape of a whale (one by Rodion Shchedrin, bottom left) which, even if they sound no more comprehensible than the call of the right back whale when played, will be homage enough.",1983-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Profits of the seven operating companies and the new A.T.& T. will will rise to $8.7 billion, from $7.3 billion in 1982; revenues will balloon, primarily from double accounting methods, to $116 billion from a 1982 total of $65 billion, and the highest-paid chief executive of the operating companies will be William L. Weiss of Ameritech at $465,000. Trading in the new Bell shares will start tomorrow, even though stock certificates will not be issued until February.

Their ideological competition then was ''far more intense than today,'' he said, and political tensions were ''no smaller.'' But he added the sweeping verdict that the problems half a century ago were modest beside today's nuclear anxieties. ''What we did not anticipate was anything resembling military conflict between our two countries,'' the renowned scholar and diplomat said. ''It is weapons we now talk about, weapons we read about, weapons we negotiate about. Behind this endless debate about weaponry the real political issues between the two countries fade into obscurity.''

POST-MODERNISTS IN THE MAINSTREAM","Much of contemporary art, especially that which we know as Post-Modernist, is meant to undercut and displace the esthetic standards and aspirations of its antecedents. This rejection of the immediate past has, of course, long been a strategy for artists; rebellious sons have savaged their painterly forefathers with Oedipal regularity throughout art history. (Never mind that such a rejection frequently proves illusory, a convenient fiction that gives art and artists room to breathe.) It is characteristic of Modernist art, just as it is of Post-Modernist art. What makes Post-Modernist art different, if we are to believe its most articulate advocates, is that it stands in opposition not only to the Modernist art that is its immediate forebear but also to the entire tradition of high culture and its institutions.",1983-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Charles, her physician husband, is in attendance. ''She gave birth on a Sunday at about six o'clock, as the sun was rising,'' the translation reads. '' 'It is a girl!' said Charles.

The decision allows Avezzano, who has a 4-38-2 career record at Oregon State, to complete his five-year contract, which expires after next season.

Mr. MacVicar acknowledged that the university was ''disappointed with Coach Avezzano over the football win-loss record,'' but added: ''The future of football as a sport, particularly Division I football, has become a national concern, and other things than wins and losses must be considered in terms of football's impact on the essential character of the sponsoring universities.''

We see, for instance, a rainbow born in a black sky, the dunes outside of Provincetown, Mass., a vast coal pile near the Ohio River, beaches, drive-in theaters, full moons and rising suns over mountains and deserts.

Though his roots were Chinese, he was in great demand for roles as Japanese villains during World War II and, as his daughter said, ''was always either stabbing himself or committing hara- kiri or kamikaze . . . because he never got the best of the Americans.'' Forty years ago and thereabouts I saw Mr. Loo die many times and, though it may seem shameful nowadays, cheered each death without the slightest sensation of unseemly behavior. Revisers of history may clutch at this confession as proof that I was besotted with anti-Asian racism cooked up by American propagandists to promote the war effort against Japan. To which I say, ''Poppycock!'' American love of all things Chinese was as irrational and deep then as its hatred of all things Japanese. What made Mr. Loo's deaths so easy to cheer was much simpler than racism. First, you always knew he would be back at this devilish business of tormenting American G.I.'s before the month was out at the movie theater. Second, he always died in good taste. Even when committing hara-kiri, he was neat about it. I wish present day movie actors would study his work.

By Bernard Gwertzman FTER FAILING FOR more than a year to make much headway with its Middle East initiatives, the Reagan Administration has decided to turn to Israel for help. That is the word today in a White House candidly frustrated over the continuing impasse in Lebanon, increasing tension in the whole region and conspicuous lack of support from most Arab governments. To break out of its predicament, the United States, it is felt, must take more resourceful advantage of the political and military power base represented by the Jewish state. A senior American official puts it this way: ''If we don't have good, close relations with Israel, we will have no anchor in the region. We will be alone with a battleship and 2,000 marines.'' To secure this anchor, President Reagan has secretly authorized a new effort to convince Israel's leaders that the two countries should put aside their recriminations and enter into a degree of ''strategic cooperation'' that would go far beyond anything tried before. It is a potentially controversial policy. There is little enthusiasm for it in the Pentagon, which would have to play the leading role in the largely military measures envisaged in the plan. If carried out, the new policy could further damage America's standing as mediator between Arabs and Israelis. It could even split the Middle East into Israeli-American and Syrian-Soviet spheres.",1983-11-27T05:00:00+0000

They were protesting the publishing industry's ''antiquated'' and ''unimaginative'' book selling methods. Nowadays, authors still bridle at the way publishers handle their books, but they are taking to the courts, rather than the streets. The result so far has been a few wins, one draw and a great deal of industry soul searching.Last year, a writer named Bill Starr won a suit in Municipal Small Claims Court in Los Angeles against Pinnacle Books, which Mr. Starr accused of failing to market and advertise in good faith his novel ''Chance Fortune.'' ''The defense asked whether I knew there were writers of different quality,'' said Marvin Gevurtz, who presided over the hearing. ''My response was that if you feel a person is untalented or unworthy of a full-faith effort, you shouldn't enter into a contract with him.'' Last month, in an out-of-court settlement of another suit, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich paid $100,000 to Deborah Davis, author of ''Katharine the Great,'' a 1979 biography of Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company. Miss Davis had sued Harcourt Brace for $6 million charging breach of contract; the publisher, she said, had recalled the book and pulped copies. (Harcourt Brace denied the charge, but said it had returned the publication rights to the author after belatedly discovering extensive factual errors in the book.)",1983-11-27T05:00:00+0000

There is usually little time for subtlety or artistic imprint. In fact, that's how most of the early Hollywood films were made, the same films that are now viewed as classics in tiny theaters, museums and on public television. But no matter.

The company had originally planned to grow into its generous office space at One Astor Place in midtown Manhattan but decided instead to acquire satellite agencies housed in separate buildings. So, capitalizing on its excessively roomy quarters, it gave up an option on the extra space at One Astor Place and collected a note for $15 million from the owner of the building. ''We were not looking for a profit,'' said Donald Zuckert, Bates's executive vice president responsible for real estate. ''It was just a question of timing. We no longer needed the space.'' Rising commercial real estate rents in the last several years have given a growing list of companies the chance to realize such profits. The companies are subletting or selling back leases on office space they contracted for in the late 1960's and early 70's, when the recession had caused a glut in the market and rents were relatively low. Traditionally cash-poor service companies such as advertising agencies are finding that long-term leases - usually thought of as liabilities - can be the source of enormous windfalls. In the Ted Bates case, a combination of circumstances led to the agency's enviable position: In 1968, it signed a 25-year lease on 300,000 square feet in One Astor Place, a building in the Times Square area, and took an option to rent 500,000 more, at the low price of $8 a square foot.",1983-11-27T05:00:00+0000
