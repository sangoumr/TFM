RECORD Judging by the current listing in the Guinness Book of Records, Mrs. Kastner and Mr. Kornbluh may be the oldest living twins in the United States. The 1995 edition lists identical twins born in 1901 in Michigan as the oldest living twins. Mrs. Greenfarb has written to the publishers but has not received an answer. HOW THEY GOT HERE The twins are the last survivors of eight brothers and sisters, all of whom moved to the United States from Bolcshovic, Austria. Mrs. Kastner arrived in 1920, when she was 20, with her father. Mr. Kornbluh had arrived several years earlier. Neither twin ever returned to Austria. OFFSPRING Mrs. Kastner has a daughter, Psela Greenfarb of Edison, six grandsons and nine great-grandchildren; her son, Lester, died in 1992 at 63. Mr. Kornbluh has one son, Bill, of Greenburgh, N.Y., three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. OCCUPATIONS Mrs. Kastner was a draper, dressing models in New York City, until she married and became a homemaker. Mr. Kornbluh was a furrier and has lived in the Bronx most of his life. CURRENT RESIDENCES Mrs. Kastner has lived at the New Jersey Geriatric Center of Workmen's Circle in Elizabeth for two years. Before that, she lived on her own in Newark, where she had spent most of her life. Mr. Kornbluh lives at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, the Bronx. REASON FOR MRS. KASTNER'S LONG LIFE ""I've been lucky. God's given me a long life, that's all."" She leads a healthy life, not smoking and drinking very little, her daughter said. She never owned a car and walked wherever she needed to go in Newark, delivering her husband's lunch to him at the couple's print shop about a mile from their home daily for many years. MR. KORNBLUH'S OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTIC His sense of humor, says his son, Bill. At 92, when he arrived at the nursing home where he now lives, he told Bill, he had ""to liven the place up a bit."" Having outlived two wives, Mr. Kornbluh had a sweetheart at the nursing home until she, too, died recently. ""That's the problem with living so long: you lose people you love,"" Bill said. HAPPIEST MOMENTS ""When I see my children and grandchildren, this is my happiest moment,"" Mrs. Kastner said, and she is doing so at this year's birthday party, to which 70 relatives and friends are invited. ""I'm also happy when my daughter comes to the Oneg Shabbat at the nursing home and sings."" Her special song: ""Sunrise, Sunset"" from ""Fiddler on the Roof.""

IN 1957, at the age of 14, Raymond Hedin entered St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee with the hope that 11 years later he would become a parish priest in the Roman Catholic Church. Now, almost 40 years later, a man twice married, the father of two children, a college professor, he introduces us to classmates who began the same religious journey -- most of whom, like him, abandoned the trek before ordination, some of whom left after having taken vows, and some of whom, now priests, continue their pilgrimage. Although Mr. Hedin teaches literature -- especially African-American fiction -- at Indiana University, he has dared take upon himself a major social science inquiry, and even presents the reader with what some researchers portentously call a ""methodology."" Mostly he tape-recorded the conversations he had, but sometimes he simply wrote down what he remembered immediately afterward. Mercifully for us and for his old classmates, he came with no questionnaire or test, only a freewheeling desire to learn what had informed their decision to stay the course or to leave. (Some are now indifferent or outright hostile to religion; some are trying hard to stay within a church whose proclaimed truths they don't always accept; some are comfortably loyal to and happy with that church.)",1995-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Hot Type,"Many people already know everything there is to know about the contents of Howard Stern's MISS AMERICA (Regan Books, $27.50), the cover of which shows Mr. Stern in drag on the front and in a tuxedo hobnobbing with O. J. Simpson on the back. Inside, the jacket tells us, you'll find details of Mr. Stern's secret meeting with Michael Jackson and his pact with Adolf Hitler, as well as 40 pictures of naked breasts, so there is little point in discussing the literary merits here. But what readers may take for granted is the book's design, a complex melange of typographic hierarchies. It is a remarkable display of deconstructive, post-structural, post-modern experimentation -- or to put it simply for the layman, words explode across the page. The text and binding were designed by Chip Kidd and Nina Gaskin; the jacket and the inserted color section were designed by Jack Heller (no relation) and Ralph Cirella. Each of the 482 pages is a distinct design experience. But this kind of expressive typography is not new. In 1918 Guillaume Apollinaire published an antiwar poem, ""Il Pleut,"" with lines of type falling down the page simulating a rainstorm; in 1914 F. T. Marinetti wrote and designed the Futurist book ""Zang Tumb Tuuuum,"" using discordant typefaces designed to visually approximate the sounds that he described in words; and in 1967 Quentin Fiore gave a visual voice to Marshall McLuhan's ""Medium Is the Massage"" through a rebuslike integration of word and image complemented by shifts in typographic size and weight. In 1970 Mr. Fiore brought the same kinetic type and page design to Jerry Rubin's book ""Do It!,"" to which ""Miss America"" owes a distinct debt. Unfortunately, ""Miss America"" really doesn't go as far as some of these books. While the design shouts and screams, by the standards of other 20th-century books it is actually pretty timid.

us,That New-Age Religion,"MARRIED TO THE CHURCH By Raymond Hedin. 259 pp. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $29.95. IN 1957, at the age of 14, Raymond Hedin entered St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee with the hope that 11 years later he would become a parish priest in the Roman Catholic Church. Now, almost 40 years later, a man twice married, the father of two children, a college professor, he introduces us to classmates who began the same religious journey -- most of whom, like him, abandoned the trek before ordination, some of whom left after having taken vows, and some of whom, now priests, continue their pilgrimage. Although Mr. Hedin teaches literature -- especially African-American fiction -- at Indiana University, he has dared take upon himself a major social science inquiry, and even presents the reader with what some researchers portentously call a ""methodology."" Mostly he tape-recorded the conversations he had, but sometimes he simply wrote down what he remembered immediately afterward. Mercifully for us and for his old classmates, he came with no questionnaire or test, only a freewheeling desire to learn what had informed their decision to stay the course or to leave. (Some are now indifferent or outright hostile to religion; some are trying hard to stay within a church whose proclaimed truths they don't always accept; some are comfortably loyal to and happy with that church.)",1995-12-10T05:00:00+0000

A few skittish guards had been placing offerings of food and flowers under trees to appease them. Others wore amulets to ward them off.

The latest treatment of BLACK BEAUTY (1994), Anna Sewell's novel about a Victorian horse that passes from owner to owner, is directed by Caroline Thompson. The lovely backgrounds, the brooding music and the humans involved - Sean Bean, Jim Carter, Eleanor Bron and David Thewlis - all score. But the star is Beauty, who narrates the story - Monday at 10:30 A.M. on Cinemax. Channel 31 has a pair of golden Gallic antiques. Maurice Tourneur's VOLPONE (1939) is a juicy, superbly performed version of Ben Jonson's flavorsome costume farce about greed. Harry Baur is perfectly cast as the rich Venetian who feigns dying to test the vultures; Louis Jouvet is Mosca, his even craftier steward. The two great actors shake the old play with gusto - Thursday-Friday at 1 A.M. In Rene Clement's FORBIDDEN GAMES (1952) the tender relationship of two farm children (Brigitte Fossey, Georges Poujouly) yields a series of innocent, playful games that are clearly warfare allegory. This beautifully provocative drama is haunting - Tuesday at 8 P.M. Set in the American Southwest, THE OUTRAGE (1964), Martin Ritt's remake of ""Rashomon,"" may not have the high-voltage originality of the Japanese thunderbolt, but trim and biting, it works. Paul Newman, Claire Bloom, Laurence Harvey, Edward G. Robinson and the gritty Ritt keep it on track - Tuesday at 4 P.M. on TNT (and colorized). A battered, aging, small-time pugilist (Robert Ryan, pictured above) resists corruption and doggedly hangs in, flanked by a loyal wife (Audrey Totter) - that's the bleak gist of THE SET-UP (1949). Directed by Robert Wise, it's also one of the best boxing dramas ever filmed - Thursday at 6 P.M. on American Movie Classics. HOWARD THOMPSON",1995-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: NONFICTION;An Artist, Not a Wife","As an art student in Greenwich Village in the 1930's, Lee Krasner (1908-1984) was notable for both the sophistication with which she absorbed the achievements of the early Modernists and her ferocious ambition as a painter. But throughout a stormy marriage to Jackson Pollock, she repeatedly set aside her own work to foster and promote his, a course that can be ascribed to either female masochism or a rational recognition that his brilliance exceeded her own. Only in the 70's, long after Pollock's death in 1956, did Krasner receive serious recognition. Ellen G. Landau, who has written an impressive book on Pollock, has lovingly catalogued Krasner's entire output in LEE KRASNER: A Catalogue Raisonne (Abrams, $95; $125 after Jan. 1) -- some 600 paintings, drawings and collages. Like Krasner herself -- a fiercely honest, formidable woman -- many of these works have an authoritative presence, yet for all their skill, and the astute visual intelligence on display, they never quite achieve that unmistakable originality that finally distinguishes the good artist from the great one. Ms. Landau, a professor in the Case Western Reserve University/Cleveland Museum of Art joint program in art history, argues that critics who have faulted Krasner for the obvious influences at work in her art -- Picasso, Matisse and, finally, Pollock himself -- fail to appreciate that ""her creativity was primarily dialogic."" However, when we look at a painting and straightaway think not of the artist who executed it but of some great predecessor or contemporary, no amount of talent and seriousness (or theoretical justification) can compensate for what is missing. Sadly, some of Krasner's earlier work -- done before she met Pollock -- has more immediacy and power than anything she did later, which makes one sense, all over again, what she may have sacrificed. Krasner once called her paintings ""biographical,"" but the narrative they evoke seems different from the one she had in mind; above all, her work tells the story of someone eternally paying homage to the genius of others.

(Even the spelling of the name is controversial; The New York Times uses the older German spelling, while Mr. Shreeve has opted for a more modern form.)

Furthermore, the solution for finding long-term care is careful savings and, in some cases, long-term care insurance.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Heroism Before Jack Aubrey,"For fans of Patrick O'Brian, here is an unexpected bonus: a precursor to the Aubrey-Maturin series of Napoleonic-era seafaring adventures, with all the charm of the author's mature works. And for those who have been daunted by the prospect of embarking on a 17-volume series, here is the perfect way to test the waters. THE UNKNOWN SHORE (Norton, $23) first came out in 1959, but it has the same elements that mark Mr. O'Brian's more recent works: the wealth of social detail, the quiet humor, the harrowing shipwrecks, the swashbuckling adventures in foreign parts -- and, most important, the abiding and unlikely friendship between two young men, one a sociable creature born to the sea and the other a surgeon's mate, brilliant in scientific understanding but lacking in social graces. Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow are a bit younger than Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, but the dynamic is the same. When Toby is in a haze of oblivion, Jack helps him navigate the puzzling terrain of human relations: in an early escapade, when Toby has become lost in London, wandering around dressed in a sack after having been set upon by thieves, Jack arranges for a flock of turkeys to be released from the top of a monument, knowing that Toby, an ardent naturalist, will be irresistibly drawn to the spectacle. Once at sea, the action becomes more grisly, as the 220 men who set out from England to circumnavigate the globe dwindle down to a mere handful. Jack and Toby stick together through it all, painfully making their way across swamps and stormy seas, from barren islands to Indian camps, finally arriving safely in Valparaiso. From a cozy, well-lighted 20th-century home, their travails could not be more delightful to contemplate. TAMAR LEWIN",1995-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;The Master of Giverny,"Almost since their inception, the sun-drenched landscapes of Claude Monet have been renowned for their breathtaking formal achievement and for the esthetic pleasure they confer. In CLAUDE MONET: Life and Art (Yale University, $40), the distinguished Monet scholar Paul Hayes Tucker undertakes a critical examination of the work and reputation of the master of Giverny. Combining an analysis of the social context in which Monet worked with close examinations of the paintings, Mr. Tucker, an art professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, challenges the longstanding formalist interpretation of Monet's work. Examining Monet's landscapes in the context of shifting social, economic and political circumstances, and of the artist's own position as a successful and highly ambitious member of the new suburban bourgeoisie, Mr. Tucker sees Monet's work as intimately connected to the process of industrialization. He notes, for example, that Monet's early paintings of the Parisian suburb of Argenteuil, where he and his family moved in 1872, register confidence in the promise of industrialization; later pictures show the erosion of the landscape and the degradation of rural life brought about by overdevelopment. Monet's ultimate retreat into the garden world he constructed at Giverny, following his stunning success as his generation's pre-eminent painter of French subjects, was at least in part, Mr. Tucker argues, a response to a political event, the Dreyfus affair. Monet's involvement, Mr. Tucker suggests, ultimately prompted him to withdraw into a secluded garden of his own making, and in contemplation of this orderly world to paint the monumental pictures that are undoubtedly his best-known works today.

Museums offer free admission to donors, while opera and dance groups get you in for a dress rehearsal and maybe let you mingle with the stars. Of course, your tax deduction is reduced by the value of the benefit you receive, but some charities will gladly help by giving you nothing.

This pigment, which the liver turns into vitamin A, is why carrots and cantaloupes are good for you -- and why they are orange. So Philipp Simon, who breeds plants at a U.S.D.A. lab in Madison, Wis., and John Navazio, a plant geneticist, have added it to cucumbers. The new strains, which still taste like cukes, aren't as rich in beta carotene as carrots, Navazio says, but they compare favorably with many squashes and melons as a source of the nutrient. In third-world tropical climates, Navazio notes, cucumbers are an important part of the diet but carrots are not. ""These people are short of carotene, and cukes could be a major source.""

The rabbi spends a few minutes alone with the child and then confers with the mother, who emerges from their talk sobbing and refusing to answer any of her son's questions.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION,"WRITING AND BEING By Nadine Gordimer. Harvard University, $18.95. Fans of the South African novelist Nadine Gordimer will appreciate her skill as an essayist and critic in ""Writing and Being,"" which collects the six Charles Eliot Norton lectures she gave at Harvard University in 1994. More than half of the book is devoted to a lovingly detailed analysis of novels by Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, Chinua Achebe of Nigeria and Amos Oz of Israel; Ms. Gordimer maintains that these three, although seemingly disparate, are ""at one in being ready to go too far"" in their pursuit of truth in their writing, ""the final destination of the human spirit beyond national boundaries, natal traditions."" Drawn to the political focus of these writers because of her own experience as a writer in apartheid South Africa, Ms. Gordimer also notes that rhetoric that would ""break the spell of the imagination in most fiction"" is acceptable in the work of these writers because ""politics and its language, in imagery, in allusion, in interpretation of daily life, are so pressing a part of everyday speech in this Other World."" More personal are the beginning and ending essays of the collection -- the first a consideration of the exasperation writers feel when their readers ask ""on which living personage this or that character is based,"" the last an account of Ms. Gordimer's struggle to understand her place in South Africa as a young white woman and as a writer. ""It was with my stories and novels,"" she writes, ""my offering of what I was learning about the life within me and around me, that I entered the commonality of my country.""

Since Christmas 1964, when the oil company offered 50,000 plastic tanker trucks for $1.39 apiece, presumably as gifts for the kids, the annual arrival of a new model at Thanksgiving has taken on the dazzle of a Detroit unveiling. For many, Hess's standard promotion has become holiday tradition. But now the kids have to wrestle the trucks from the grown-ups. Like so many relics of childhood, the vehicles have become valuable: that $1.39 truck may be worth $3,500. This year's model, $15.99, is a trailer complete with helicopter. Hess made 1.5 million.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION,"THE WHITE ROOSTER & OTHER STORIES By Robert Bausch. Gibbs Smith, $19.95. Robert Bausch writes about ordinary small-town Americans caught up in the loneliness of day-to-day living. Often enough, their world looks as bleak as the ""stained and pale"" moon rising from the ""ragged edge of black pines"" at the lake where one character goes to escape his insomnia. Throughout this collection, people wrestle with their sense of estrangement from one another. In ""Family Lore,"" a daughter watches while her father is humiliated by his brothers, then thinks about the way we create distances ""for ourselves in this small world."" Many of Mr. Bausch's characters, whether married or not, could identify wholeheartedly with the narrator's refrain in a story called ""The Stag Party"": ""I am completely alone."" Even when they try to shake off their inertia, as Daniel Cochran does in ""Vigilance"" when he breaks into a house to teach his neighbors a lesson about the importance of forming a neighborhood watch, they cannot escape their fundamental sense of alienation: ""Cochran . . . wanted to laugh with them and feel young and blameless."" But the problem with these stories isn't their grim outlook. Instead it's their execution: endings that sometimes dwindle off, without much resolution or insight; language that fails to engage. And yet Mr. Bausch is capable of better things. In the best of his work, like ""The Perfect Prayer,"" the story of a little girl whose father is dying, he achieves a taut and affecting kind of poetry. LINDA RODGERS",1995-12-24T05:00:00+0000

So far, 15,000 of the 20,000 American troops slotted for Bosnia have trained in Udorf, and the rest are scheduled to ""occupy"" it in the coming months.

No, maybe we should call it the meta-ironic era. Q: How about the whole 1970's retro fad? Were those really the good old days? Becker: Not particularly for me. I think a lot of this nostalgia for the 70's has to do with the fact that it's just another decade people are mining for whatever cultural aura they can find. I think we're in kind of a culturally colonialistic period where we're going to other places and times to see what's worth taking.",1995-12-24T05:00:00+0000

With 1,312 pages, each 10 by 14 inches of heavy archival paper, in its gilt-stamped slipcase, this Bible weighs 15.5 pounds, as heavy as stone tablets from Mount Sinai perhaps. What gives it real distinction, however, is its art: 263 paintings and 407 artistic ornaments from Renaissance masters -- principally the Ghirlandaio-painted pages in the Vatican Library's 15th-century Urbino Bible -- lavishly printed in six colors and outlined with a specially concocted gold ink that does indeed gleam on the page. The text is the New Revised Standard Version, the one that banishes all the male pronouns it can and otherwise tries to take offense out of the archaic book's archaic language. But it is still pungent. If you turn to the Gospel of St. Luke, on page 1,069 you will find Jesus in a synagogue reading from the prophet Isaiah: ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor."" And although this edition's apparatus lacks the cross-referencing common to most cheap modern versions, if you riffle through Isaiah you will find the original at page 587, referring to the poor as ""the oppressed."" Of course, this magnificent production does not seem intended to let the poor know about their good news. It comes with a quire of blank genealogical charts for families to immortalize themselves in for generations, and a big presentation medallion at the very front, in case someone wants to make a lavish gift and insure that the giver's name will be the first thing a reader will see.

But readers fearing high seriousness need not be concerned: ""Angel Light"" is a bit of froth featuring a genial Irish-American, computer technology, romantic fantasy and the Old Testament book of Tobias. In this breezy narrative -- which reads more like the first draft of a novel than a finished piece of work -- a mysterious force compels a Chicago computer nerd named Toby Tobin to type some travel queries into his computer. The replies come from an unexpected correspondent -- none other than the patron saint of travelers, surfing the Net in search of someone to help. That heavenly being, who signs on as Rafe, uses both the names Raphael and Raphaella in the course of the novel. Although the saint takes human form in ""her professional woman modality"" of a ""dark blue suit, beige blouse, nylons, sensible shoes, even rimless glasses,"" she is really the Archangel Raphael. Things in heaven must be a lot more complicated than mere mortal writing machines like Father Greeley can convey! Rafe offers Toby an abbreviated version of a biblical tale before sending him off to O'Hare Airport, including a reminder that the original story has ""profound and powerful and modern, almost feminist, concern for respect of women."" Angelic intervention is an old-fashioned plot device, no matter how newfangled the trimmings. Why is Rafe getting involved? Another old-fashioned plot device: it seems that a great-uncle has left Toby $10 million on the condition that he end a family feud by going to Ireland and marrying his distant cousin, Sara Anne, a proposal he has refused. Guess where Toby ends up and whom he ends up marrying? Sara Anne, when he finally meets her, turns out to be a beautiful liturgical composer, a computer whiz and, of course, something of a feminist.

At first blush, ""The Culture of Hope"" looks like yet another cautious exercise in on-the-other-handedness by an anxious academic who is fed up with liberal orthodoxy but nonetheless feels obliged to serve up a few ritual denunciations of conservatism in order to keep peace in the faculty lounge: ""The radical center rejects the ethnocentrism of the right, but it also rejects the demonization of the West by the left."" However, Frederick Turner, who teaches arts and humanities at the University of Texas, Dallas, is definitely not your standard-issue anxious academic. He claims to be the spokesman for a whole new generation of artists and scholars who believe that ""art can, from the strictest traditions and severest order, derive unexpected and profoundly original visions and perspectives."" (Needless to say, any resemblances to good old modernism are purely coincidental.) In fact, Mr. Turner's ""new classical spirit"" turns out to be a half-baked mishmash of art and science with a strong New Age flavor, and he crusades for it with all the lapel-grabbing zest of an autodidact on an intellectual bender. ""Imagine you were wired into the basic structure of Oregon, for instance,"" he writes. ""As Oregon begins to respond to your purposes, you simultaneously become transformed into something with a hot volcanic spine, with the moisture-loving dim appetite of the Douglas fir, with the feel of the Pacific surf upon your right shoulder, and the soft draining of great rivers across your body.""

When Papa Job, a young West Indian living in Detroit in the 1950's, discovers that someone is stealing cans of food from his basement, he hides in the dark to catch the thief -- and then promptly asks her to marry him. Sizway, the thief, is a tiny, mysterious Haitian woman ""the color of blackberries,"" a so-called black gypsy who can read Papa Job's mind. ""You be a man of flesh and I a woman of spirit,"" she warns him when he proposes. ""You and me . . . don't mix."" Presented in the form of a mystical cautionary tale told by a shadowy pipe-smoking woman, Gita Brown's first novel examines the difficulties that are presented when opposites attract and worlds collide. The story follows this unlikely couple as they make their way together over the years, coping with the pressures of family life and struggling to forge a lasting bond. Their attempts to understand each other yield some valuable insights, but the convoluted narrative -- riddled with walk-ons by witches and ghosts -- is often so murky that readers may find themselves wondering just what the narrator is smoking. Quirky supporting characters appear out of nowhere, only to be promptly abandoned; and Sizway's gift of telepathy suddenly and inexplicably deserts her after the opening scenes, just when she needs it most. Every so often, the meandering plot is illuminated by flashes of poetic language, but then, frustratingly, the story is engulfed again in the haze, leaving only a tantalizing hint of the novel's early promise.

Sylvia, a 20-year-old piano prodigy at a Baltimore conservatory, tends to gaze out the window of her practice room in search of some perspective -- on the city, her life and Beethoven's Opus 111, a sonata whose complexity eludes her youthful virtuosity. Unfortunately, Paula Huston's first novel, ""Daughters of Song,"" doesn't do much to help her out. Instead of a firm hand, the author offers an omniscient point of view -- we are inside the minds of fellow students, teachers, even one of the neighborhood's many homeless drifters -- and so we wind up both everywhere and nowhere. As Sylvia separates from her parents, learns her professional limitations and experiments with sex, Ms. Huston fails to keep enough distance between the narrative and the naive young woman at its center. The use of musical metaphor is promising, as is some of the writing (coming home from a concert, Sylvia finds the long tunnel in a train station ""clamorous with graffiti""). But Sylvia, with her halo of hair and her shy innocence, is more heroine than protagonist, someone whose coming of age might be more successful in the pages of young-adult fiction.

While the first focuses on the rules and regularities of Nature -- its symmetries and rhythms -- the second tends to celebrate inventiveness, idiosyncrasy and the exceptional. ""Science and art have diverged,"" writes John D. Barrow in his new book. ""As science became more successful in its quest to explain the seen by unseen laws of Nature, so art became increasingly subjective, metaphorical and divorced from realistic representations. It explored other worlds, leaving science to deal with this one.""",1995-12-29T05:00:00+0000

The Arts Will Feel It.","Whatever else 1996 may bring, the New Year promises one frightening mathematical certainty -- the now famous statistic from the National Council on Aging: starting at midnight tonight and continuing through the year 2014, a member of the baby-boom generation will turn 50 on the average of every 7.5 seconds. That adds up to more than 75 million voters, consumers and employees (boomers make up more than a third of the nation's population of approximately 250 million). The impact of this demographic milestone has been much explored in economic and social terms. But its effects on culture promise to be no less momentous. Could classical music's popularity suddenly soar, as millions of baby boomers finally admit that they don't feel angry enough for rock anymore? Will this notoriously self-absorbed generation remain smitten with its lost youth, as evidenced in the pop music, movies and television shows it favors, or will it confront society's conflicting attitudes toward aging? Perhaps we'll see more starring film roles for performers over 50, in tales of love and other new-found happiness among the middle-aged. (Maybe Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" were only the beginning.) The New York Times asked six notable people in the arts who will turn 50 in 1996 to reflect on the possibilities. Page 24.",1995-12-31T05:00:00+0000

He was 89 years old now -- on the verge of becoming a nonagenarian.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION & POETRY;Nowhere Land,"This formidably weird collection of paintings by Timothy C. Ely has its origin in a journal kept by the artist's grandfather during a 16-week journey to Egypt in the 1920's, but any resemblance to a conventional travelogue ends there. Pyramids, circles, serpentine lines -- even depictions of the journal itself -- are embedded in colored maps and landscapes, with an occasional snapshot thrown in the mix. Indecipherable hieroglyphical writing appears alongside English words and baffling phrases (""concertina guard + coptic w/ beads""), bookbinding instructions, cartographic markings and snatches of the journal. None of this makes any sense, but that may be beside the point, since Mr. Ely seems to be more interested in providing a mandala than a Rosetta stone. ""What I'm trying to do is assemble symbols in such a way that a shift occurs in the viewer . . . a heightened awareness, like getting a whiff of a strange smell and suddenly getting just a little bit of clarity,"" he says in a not entirely helpful interview at the end of THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT: Binding the Book (Chronicle, $25). Speaking of whiffs of strange smells, Terence McKenna, a noted advocate of hallucinogenic drugs, suggests in an entertaining foreword stuffed with New Age blarney that the best way to approach this material is from a skewed angle, perhaps (surprise) through mind-altering substances. There is undeniable craftsmanship in ""The Flight Into Egypt,"" which employs a relentlessly geometric -- if impenetrable -- logic and has an obsessive quality in its detail. At best, these moodscapes have genuine power, evoking M. C. Escher and the hidden tracks spreading out across Australia that Bruce Chatwin described in ""The Songlines""; at worst, they resemble a wacked-out version of ""Griffin & Sabine.""

I still wore my striped prison tunic and pants, with nothing underneath. I tried another hospital, to no avail. As I walked the streets not knowing what to do, I was approached by a kind Frenchwoman who took me to her house, gave me a bath and called a doctor, who had me admitted to a German field hospital in a vocational school (Berufschule), which Schneider mentions. It was another two days before a German doctor, still in uniform, came to examine me. Instead of speaking to me, he kept hitting my chin to make me turn my head. (I guess he was afraid of infection.)

Although the privilege of nondisclosure is still sanctioned by law in most states, in the years since Tarasoff the screen of confidentiality governing what patients tell therapists has been increasingly perforated. In the private sphere, managed health care systems keep tabs on the course of psychotherapeutic treatments and medical insurers obtain the psychiatric records of clients seeking reimbursement for therapists' bills.

""Indescribable horror"": the very notion, now so worn with use, in fact marked a sharp reversal of our most enduring literary impulse, from the ""Iliad"" and Moses' song over the drowned Egyptian cavalry through to Tolstoy. By the second year of the Great War, amid unprecedented carnage and the sense that no one could explain anymore what cause it served, there grew up in Britain a soldiers' literature obsessed with the divide between available language and actual experience. Countless letters and poems and diaries condemned their own habits of eloquence as a betrayal of truth. But still they were written; it was, after all, a prodigiously literary war. In Pat Barker's novel ""The Ghost Road,"" the final volume in a trilogy that makes this war the close and pressing history of our present moment, Lieut. Billy Prior sits listening to the sounds of pens scratching and pages turning -- ""at least two would-be poets in this hut alone"" -- and, in his own diary, tells us why these men write: ""I think it's a way of claiming immunity.

Again defying conventional wisdom, Alfven was also the first to argue that interstellar space is not a vacuum but a sea of ions -- a plasma -- interlaced with magnetic field lines.

We ""have the luxury to build that which we can't really use,"" explains Kenji Kawakami, a former cartoon scriptwriter, bicycle museum designer and home shopping magazine editor who now devotes himself to subverting the Japanese obsession with gadgets and technology. His latest book, 101 UNUSELESS JAPANESE INVENTIONS: The Art of Chindogu (Norton, paper, $10.95), may also subvert the American notion that he and his countrymen are conformist robots, lacking the genes for whimsy and anarchy. A Chindogu, as Mr. Kawakami puts it (with the help of his translator, Dan Papia), is an almost useless invention, something that looks as if it's going to make your life easier -- and only succeeds in making it more ridiculous. Like the hay fever hat, a roll of paper tissues that sits snugly on the sufferer's head, fresh sheet dangling handily just above eye level. Or the golfer's practice umbrella, equipped with a club head at the tip, perfect for chip shots on a subway platform. Admittedly, some Chindogu may speak to distinctly Japanese social needs: consider, for example, the sweetheart's training arm, an extra appendage that attaches to a coat or jacket, recommended for ""the early stages of courting"" to avoid ""the worry of sweaty palms, inappropriate pressure or when to disengage."" Then again, what married woman of any nationality hasn't yearned for the back scratcher's T-shirt stamped with a handy ""itch-locater grid,"" the perfect garment for a demanding mate? Or, better still, the dust and shake, a combination duster and martini shaker that rewards vigorous cleaning, providing a truly fine incentive for tackling room after room after room. Mr. Kawakami may have strayed from his absurdist mandate on that one. It seems to me the height of civilized invention. ALIDA BECKER",1995-12-31T05:00:00+0000
