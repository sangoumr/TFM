Nearly a fourth of Americans claimed to have eaten less meat in 2019, according to a Gallup poll. The recipe site Epicurious, which reaches an audience of 10 million, phased out beef as an ingredient in new recipes in 2020. Diners at some McDonalds can now sate their lust for a Quarter Pounder with a vegan McPlant instead. Faux meat products are projected to reach $85 billion in sales by 2030, according to a recent study by UBS, and Tyson Foods, one of the biggest beef packers in the United States, has hedged its bets by introducing its own plant-based line.",2022-03-03T12:00:12+0000

us,"Mels, Wood-Fired Pizza From a Former Del Posto Chef, Opens","Fitted snugly to one side of the former Del Posto, the narrow restaurant space that was once John Dory is now a pizzeria: Mels, the first restaurant of a new food complex here. The name refers to the former Del Posto and Daniel chef Melissa J. Rodriguez, who is partnering with Jeff Katz and James Kent of Crown Shy and Saga to develop this sprawling space. (Al Coro, a lavish Italian restaurant, and Discolo, a lower-level lounge, will open in the Del Posto space in early summer.) Mels is done warmly in orange tones and polished light wood, a bar and a dining counter open into a rear dining room, and a huge wood-fired pizza oven is central to the space. Everything is cooked with wood, Ms. Rodriguez said. Theres no gas here. The pizzas start with Margherita but quickly veer into creative territory: mushrooms, smoked mozzarella and shaved shallots; and kale, basil pesto, ricotta and preserved lemon. Many appetizers, like roasted parsnips with robiola cheese, roasted maitake mushrooms with soppressata piccante, and charred shrimp, are wood fired, as are mains like whole fish, whole roasted cauliflower and strip steak. Unlike at most pizzerias, dessert is neither an afterthought nor skippable. Consider milk chocolate gelato with dark chocolate sable swirl; salted caramel and fior di latte gelato with caramel sauce and shortbread crumble; or an Italian rainbow cookie hot fudge sundae, a tribute to Little Italy. The timing of the opening is calculated so that Ms. Rodriguez, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has several months to get Mels in order before Al Coro is unveiled.

Its not much fun to live through, but in hindsight it can make for pretty good copy  so its not surprising to find, at the center of this weeks recommended titles, that the center doesnt hold. NoViolet Bulawayos new novel, Glory, is all about political turmoil. Yoko Tawadas latest, Scattered All Over the Earth, is about climate apocalypse. Two new biographies of Buster Keaton make the case that he was not only a comic genius but also a technological disrupter, madly innovating new directions for the film industry in its early days. And in Origin, Jennifer Raff sets out to overturn some long-held theories about the first humans to populate the Americas. Things fall apart. Thats the message of The Quiet Before, by Gal Beckerman (until recently my colleague at the Book Review), about social movements building from the ground up, and its the premise (in a very different way) of The Old Woman With the Knife, Gu Byeong-mos novel about a 65-year-old female assassin in Seoul. Meanwhile, disruption of another sort  aesthetic, existential  is at the core of the Swedish writer Jon Fosses seven-novel series Septology, about an aging painter arguing with God.

Here, hidden among pines overlooking the Silver Lake neighborhoods reservoir, Nin envisioned a low, single-story aerie, which she called her one large studio, no separate, small partitions. This description appeared in the first edition of her diary (originally published in 1966), which she began writing at 11 as a child traveling to America from the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine and continued until her death. Today, there are 18 volumes with a final one left unpublished  comprising an oeuvre that also includes frank, feminist, sexually explicit, oft-censored essays about her various lovers; literary criticism (the English writer D.H.

Available for pre-order, its a timely memorial, tracing her life in California through the kitchens she experienced and ran. Notably, theres the French Laundry, which she and her husband, Don, originally owned from 1978 to 1994, when Thomas Keller took over. The first kitchen in the book was her mothers, the final one Elk Cottage, in Mendocino, Calif., where the Schmitts retired and she cooked for the two of them. The recipes woven throughout are almost book ended by the simplest from her mother: potatoes simmered then roasted to a crisp with a mustard slather; and sausages in hard cider, a two-ingredient marvel. The book, illustrated with photographs and memorabilia, is filled with often inventive but always ingredient-driven dishes, including many for duck. Some are written with step-by-step directions  two pages for a turkey sandwich!  that convey a sense that Ms. Schmitt is at your side offering handy tips. Her French Laundry recipes are pulled from daily five-course menus: warm salad of sweetbreads and mushrooms; roasted rib-eye of veal; and rhubarb mousse, nothing precious. Also described are the Vintage Caf, the Chutney Kitchen and the Apple Farm, where teaching and catering mostly replaced nightly dinners.

Women and gay men and nonbinary people frequently remark on his appeal. While that appeal might have a daddy-issues vibe, it is also nostalgic for an old-school movie star masculinity that was problematic in its own time (the patriarchal colonialism!) and that has been now defanged in the #MeToo era.

Just a year earlier, the environmentalist Bill McKibben had railed against the cultures perceived indifference. Where are the books? The poems? The plays?

Raised on Manhattans Upper East Side by an Austrian mother and a Hungarian father, she spent her childhood days wandering through museums and art galleries with her family. As a student at LaGuardia High School of Music and Art, Kosann would head downtown after class to rummage through antiques stores. At 16, the gift of a Rollei film camera from her father changed her life. Inspired by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, she spent the next two decades taking portraits of friends and acquaintances. Her love of old, beautiful things never faded, and she amassed in that time about a gazillion Art Deco cigarette cases, powder compacts, Victorian lockets and minaudires from the early 1900s, which she acquired at the March aux Puces de Saint-Ouen in Paris, along Portobello Road in London and down Viennas cobblestone side streets. Kosann would insert her photos into what she called image cases, and give them as presents to friends, and by 2003, she launched her namesake line of sterling silver photo boxes.

These take many forms: tiny-home villages that provide a shed-size house for two residents, repurposed hotel rooms and Safe Sleep sites where people can move into tents.

Instead of Little Leaguers elbow, they might have had fiddlers neck, a bruise on the side of the throat that resembles a very ardent hickey, as Natalie Hodges, a longtime violinist and superb representative of this society, explains it: that badge of pride, won only after years of consistent practice.

The plot concerns Campbell (brunette, surly, poor) and Richards (blonde, popular, wealthy), who accuse their high-school guidance counselor of abuse. Soon, the story becomes a thicket of convoluted double crosses, and nothing is what it originally seemed. By the time the end credits rolled and revealed Campbell as the films criminal mastermind, I was ready to cheer. Like many of the most captivating women in these films, Campbells character is an outsider who uses others underestimation of her abilities to her advantage. Fooled by her lower-class status, her enemies think she lacks savvy, but she is in fact a cunning strategist who uses her sexuality to outwit them.",2022-03-29T09:00:07+0000
