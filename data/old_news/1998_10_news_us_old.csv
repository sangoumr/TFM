Shakespearean comedies for the modern professional class, they presuppose a highly civilized code of behavior and an advanced educational level that in a Rohmer film could be taken as universal givens. Despite what blows fate may deliver the characters, a divine plan usually emerges that overrides earlier setbacks. Rational decision-making pays off, as does trusting one's deepest intuitions.

us,A Hovering Spirit In a Gothic Revival,"''The Mystery of Irma Vep,'' a revival of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company's 1984 hit by Charles Ludlam, is far and away the funniest two hours unfolding on a New York stage. An outrageous spoof of about a thousand literary and movie genres, with references ranging from the Brontes to Mel Brooks, the play, which opened last night at the Westside Theater, tells the story of Lady Enid Hillcrest, installed as the second wife of Lord Edgar Hillcrest in Mandacrest, a chintz-filled English mansion. There, she is haunted by reminders of the mysterious Irma Vep, Lord Edgar's first wife. With two actors taking on eight roles between them, the show is solidly built on a lightning-fast series of costume changes and on gags that pile allusion upon allusion but never collapse under their silly weight. Everett Quinton, at left as Lady Enid, who was in the original production with Ludlam, is joined now by Stephen DeRosa; both exhibit a consummate sense of timing. William Ivey Long's hilarious costumes and John Lee Beatty's lavishly tacky sets perfectly complement the action.",1998-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  CALLAHAN, DR. JENNIE WAUGH,","CALLAHAN-Dr. Jennie Waugh, an author and noted educator who pioneered the use of children in broadcasting for creative and educational purposes, died on June 27 near her home in Bronxville, New York. Dr. Callahan was the first proponent of using children to enhance the creative content of both radio and television programs. She was also a pioneer in the use of broadcasting to teach dramatic and speech skills to children, while training college students as broadcast producers and directors. Many of her students moved on to become successful with television and radio networks. Entities such as the Children's Television Workshop evolved from her early work in this field. Her first book, ''Radio Workshop for Children'', published in 1948, brought her celebrity in professional broadcasting and educational circles. She worked with CBS and NBC as a creative advisor on broadcasts that included the use of children. This book also led to the formation of what is now the Film and Media Department at Hunter College, where Dr. Callahan was a professor from 1944 until 1977. Her creation of courses at Hunter College titled TV I and TV II pioneered the inclusion of broadcast production in college curriculums, and was featured prominently in the New York Times. Her second book, published in 1954, titled ''Television in School, College & Community'' was equally well received and further pioneered the use of television for educational & community purposes. Dr. Callahan was also the first woman to be named Full Professor at any City Univerity of New York college. Dr. Callahan was 91 years old when she died at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, New York. She was born on March 22, 1907 in Tarkio, Mo. to Dr. Clifton and Anna Mamie McMaster Waugh. She received her Bachelor's degree from Tarkio College, Master's degree from Northwestern University, and PhD from the University of Berlin. She married North Callahan, a noted historian, in 1944 in New York City and lived in Bronxville, NY from 1954 until her death. She is survived by her son, North Callahan, Jr of Bronxville, NY and daughter Mary Alice Covington of Mohegan Lake, NY. Her only sibling, Dr. John M.

But the one kind of playing Mr. Krakauer never imagined doing -- klezmer, the Eastern European Jewish dance music that in its current form has a strong undercurrent of American jazz -- has won him his biggest audience.",1998-10-02T05:00:00+0000

He was a familiar figure in Federal courtrooms throughout the United States and a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers. It was said that most of his well-known Fortune 400 clients quickly retained him after he first defeated them in court. Starting in 1934 with only three lawyers, Mr. Finnegan's firm (now Morgan & Finnegan, L.L.P.) has grown to one hundred lawyers specializing in patent and trademark litigation with offices in New York and Washington, D.C. Mr. Finnegan was a member of numerous legal organizations and was a past president of the New Jersey Patent Law Association. He was also an inventor and, together with his then-partner Hobart Durham, developed a simulator called (Drivotrainer) for testing and training automobile drivers. This device simulated driving situations with movies taken from a moving car. The driver's responses to various road situations in the movie, by use of brake, steering wheel and accelerator, were automatically recorded in a printed record. The simulator was adopted and sponsored by the Aetna Insurance Company as the ''Aetna Drivotrainer.'' It has been used widely throughout the country in driver training courses for high school students. Mr. Finnegan's maternal parents were pioneers in California, crossing the plains in 1849. They eventually settled in Nevada City, California where Mr. Finnegan was born. George Finnegan graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in June 1924. He served as 2nd Lieutenant in the Regular U.S. Army at Fort Scott, San Francisco. He attended law school at George Washington University and Fordham University. In February 1942, Mr. Finnegan was ordered to West Point where he was appointed Staff Judge Advocate and served, with the rank of Colonel, on the staff of Superintendent Lt. General Maxwell D. Taylor. He was decorated with the Legion of Merit for his wartime service. George Finnegan is survived by his wife, Fidella, his son George III, his daughter, Dana, six grandchildren and five great grandchildren. His first wife, Elizabeth, and his son, Marcus, predeceased him. There will be a requiem mass at West Point Holy Trinity Chapel on October 15 at 1:30 PM. Burial will be with military honors.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Italy for the Ages,"''In the center of Italian cities, the presence of the past vibrates the air,'' the American photographer Linda Butler writes in ITALY: In the Shadow of Time (Rizzoli, $50), a collection of 60 photographs. Butler, who began the project in 1992, spent eight months searching for subjects by sorting through artifacts in libraries, museums and private homes. The resulting black-and-white photographs, which often look like paintings, capture a wide variety of images from all over Italy and attempt to convey the ''distilled energy of artisans long dead.'' She shows Italy as a place of tradition where wax figures cool in a tub before being realized in bronze in a Naples foundry. The stark, strong images imply the presence of humanity through the objects Italians use and through figurative sculpture and paintings. Fascinated with light, Butler's shots play with shadow, as in the photo of the cave of the Sybil of Cumae, where Virgil once consulted the oracle. Here, the pathway looks properly foreboding and eerie as Butler shows bands of light licking the keyhole-shaped openings. By photographing little-known places or sightseer traps at early hours, she offers Italy bare and beautiful before the activity of everyday life obscures its simplicity and subdues its past. Her accounts of obtaining the pictures captivate almost as much as the images themselves -- how, for instance, she bribed a guard with $15 so she could shoot a men's bathhouse in Pompeii.

While every corporation has profit as its raison d'etre, why does the quest for dollars have to come at the expense of treating human beings with dignity? Phil Knight and Michael Jordan are correct to address the shameful conditions of Nike's factories in Asia. I wonder, however, if anyone at Nike is concerned about human-rights violations because people -- children -- are suffering needlessly, or if the concern is only for the suffering of Nike's image and bottom line. And no one at Nike seems to care that here at home, by design, poor children, teen-agers and young adults spend scarce dollars on absurdly overpriced sneakers.",1998-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Straightish,"Jonathan Ames's second novel, THE EXTRA MAN (Scribner, $23), is both a sure-footed exploration of sexual confusion and a loopily elegant, surprisingly moving urban comedy of manners. Its hero, Louis Ives, is a private-school teacher in Princeton, N.J., who goes to great lengths to mold himself into the kind of ''young gentleman-about-town'' that Maugham, Fitzgerald and Wilde once wrote about. After losing his job because of an embarrassing incident involving a co-worker's brassiere, Louis slinks off to Manhattan in shame. There he builds a prickly friendship with his new roommate, Henry Harrison, a sloppy yet debonair elderly playwright with his own bundle of eccentricities. (Henry's ''sleeping costume'' consists of a black eye mask, a blue bathing suit and a tuxedo shirt.) Louis is fascinated and charmed by the sexually ambiguous Henry, who squires a series of rich widows around town as a means of scoring free meals and theater tickets. Louis has enough trouble figuring out his own preferences. Hopelessly attracted to women, he also shows a predilection for cross-dressing and transvestites, one of whom tells him, ''You're not really straight, but you're not really gay. You're straightish.'' Without resolving Louis's confusion, Ames makes it clear that his protagonist's sexual tentativeness and anxiety are really just flimsy covers for his passion and warmth. That's what makes ''The Extra Man'' work so well. Louis may feel as awkward as Milton Berle in drag, but inside he's really Fred Astaire -- he just doesn't know it yet.

A recent renovation allowed the boys, now 9, to have their own rooms, and we tried to redress this lack of personal space. One of my sons was immediately grateful, catching on in no time to the notion of spatial privacy; the first time he slammed that door shut, banning entry by other family members, it was clear that he appreciated the full value of nursing his grievances in solitude. My other son, however, occupied the original room the boys had shared, and when I suggested we rehang the door there, he wanted nothing to do with it.

Cendant said it had filed a lawsuit against Providian because ''several representations and covenants in the acquisition agreement had not been fulfilled.''",1998-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,'When the Cat's Away'," Kinky Friedman, a songwriter and performer turned novelist, brings to crime fiction something that no other writer can offer: himself. The hero of ''When the Cat's Away,'' as was the case in the two previous entries in this series, is none other than Kinky Friedman. For that matter, an extraordinary number of the characters who people these pages have real-life counterparts, from the book editor whose missing cat first involves Kinky in the novel's convoluted goings-on to the hero's trusty sidekick, Ratso. When a friend's beloved feline disappears from its cage during a Madison Square Garden cat show, Kinky agrees to take the case. Soon he's involved with dead bodies, a menacing figure in a cat's mask, warring Colombian drug families and a mysterious half-Palestinian, half-Colombian beauty. None of this makes much sense, of course, but that's not the point. Humor is. Mr. Friedman, who once named his backup band ''the Texas Jewboys,'' applies the same craziness to novel writing. Unfortunately, what works within the limited span of a popular song is less successful over the course of 200 pages. Kinky the character does just fine. Kinky the author would benefit from some literary discipline. ",1998-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Nights in the Gulag L.A.,"John Ridley's crime-noir first novel, ''Stray Dogs,'' was made into the Oliver Stone movie ''U-Turn.'' This may explain why Ridley's second novel, LOVE IS A RACKET (Knopf, $24), blends elements of the noir novel with the Hollywood novel. True to the first genre, the book's hero, a hard-drinking con man named Jeffty Kittridge, owes money to Dumas, a bad guy with a deceptively soft voice who just might kill him. True to the second, Jeffty is also a hard-drinking, burned-out screenwriter already being slowly killed by ''the gulag L.A.'' Enter Mona, a street urchin with a striking resemblance to the actress Pier Angeli -- who, Jeffty reminds us, killed herself with an overdose of pills. The first thing Mona says to Jeffty is ''Change?'' She's begging for money, but the double meaning is soon clear. Jeffty recruits her for a scam that could turn his life around. The plotting is routine, but the writing is smart and edgy and even moving; if Richard Ford wrote genre fiction, it might read something like this. The only weaknesses result from unfortunate conformities to the noir formula and a digressive first act. Once Mona appears, however, Ridley has us hooked on his game.

Wallace, the general editor of ''The Baseball Anthology,'' tries to take readers from the beginnings of a ballplayer's career to the day he retires. Along the way, there are ruminations on the art of pitching, the best way to defend against the double steal and how to cope with every possible setback, from racial taunting to batting slumps. As a result, the book is an uneasy mix of too many things and not enough of anything. If you are going to include a lengthy section on defense, why omit any discussion of turning the double play? Only one page on the pain of being traded? Nor is the text improved any by Wallace's own rather lifeless prose. Still, there are some wonderful moments provided by the ballplayers themselves, and Wallace offers one genuinely real insight, an observation that seems to have been lost to so many baseball fans and writers: ''Baseball is a hard game to play.'' The black-and-white photographs are beautifully reproduced. The two-page spread of Roberto Clemente leaping for a fly ball, a white blur flashing down as he is rising, two vectors about to intersect with geometric certainty, alone is worth the price of the book.

Mr. DeBartolo pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, La., to failing to report an alleged extortion plot concocted by Edwin W. Edwards, the roguish former Governor of Louisiana. As part of a plea bargain, Mr. DeBartolo agreed to provide evidence that Mr. Edwards had demanded $400,000 in cash in exchange for using his influence to shepherd a DeBartolo riverboat casino project through the local Gaming Board.

The theme is embodied by ''Criss-Cross,'' a recent work by Helgi Tomasson, the company's visionary director. The two-part piece opens with a classical section set to Charles Avison's reworking of 12 Scarlatti sonatas for harpsichord, then moves on to modern classicism danced to a Handel-influenced Schoenberg concerto. ''Criss-Cross'' promises, too, to show off the San Franciscans' distinctive clarity and quicksilver dancing. The program will also include three modern ballet classics: George Balanchine's edgy ''Agon,'' Jerome Robbins's neurotic insect-ridden ''Cage'' and Harald Lander's ''Etudes,'' an irrepressible galumph through classical pedagogy. William Forsythe, one of the most influential ballet choreographers of the time, will be represented, as will Christopher Bruce, an import from modern dance, and Flemming Flindt, whose seldom-seen ''Lesson,'' a 1963 work inspired by the Ionesco play, is an eerie portrait of a homicidal ballet teacher. The beloved warhorses of 19th-century ballet will also be seen in excerpt in an opening night gala as wide-ranging as the season. JENNIFER DUNNING",1998-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Children's Books; Gimme Rewrite,"They're the last words any writer wants to hear: ''May I make a suggestion?'' But you'll hear them a lot if you want to write, because revision is part of the game, as Benjamin Franklin knew. The Hatmaker's Sign: A Story by Benjamin Franklin (Orchard, $15.95; ages 5 to 9) is a true tale of writerly frustration, written by Candace Fleming and illustrated by Robert Andrew Parker. As the story-within-a-story begins, it's July 1776, and Thomas Jefferson is writhing in pain as the Continental Congress debates changes (he calls them ''mutilations'') in his draft of the Declaration of Independence, which he believes to be perfect as it is. The delegates noisily argue over every treasured syllable, striking out, adding, inserting, toning down, beefing up, rewording, rephrasing and reordering. On the sidelines, meanwhile, the distraught Jefferson is consoled by his friend Ben Franklin. ''Tom,'' he says, ''this puts me in mind of a story.'' The story he tells (one that Jefferson later recalled in his memoirs) is about a Boston hatmaker who's on his way to the sign shop with a plan for a new sign. On his parchment are the words ''John Thompson, Hatmaker. Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money,'' and below them a drawing of a hat. Along the way, he meets a few people who have suggestions to offer. Each one seems to have a good idea: The hatmaker's name is irrelevant, isn't it? And why say ''inside''? Where else would the hats be sold? One by one and two by two, the carefully chosen words are struck out, and finally even the picture of the hat disappears (after all, there are hats in the shop window, aren't there?). By the time he arrives at the sign shop, his parchment is empty. But the sign maker has an idea too. ''May I make a suggestion?'' he says. ''How about: 'John Thompson, Hatmaker. Fashionable Hats Sold Inside for Ready Money.' '' Under them, he'll draw a hat. ''It's perfect!'' says the hatmaker. Fleming's retelling captures the humor of Franklin's tale and adds charming period detail, while Parker's richly colored ink-and-watercolor paintings are the perfect accompaniment. I wouldn't change a thing. Patricia T. O'Conner",1998-10-18T05:00:00+0000

David Duval, the P.G.A.'s leading money winner this year, has earned more than $2 million; Annika Sorenstam, at the top of the women's money list, has won less than half that. Nike and Titleist pay Tiger Woods some $60 million for endorsing their products; last year, Nike paid Kelli Kuehne, a promising debutante, a mere $1.5 million, a record at the time.

An experienced moviemaker, John Ford knows exactly what to do with the camera.

In the powerful final scene, Tom (Henry Fonda, above with John Carradine) bids his mother (Jane Darwell) farewell. Fonda and the picture were nominated for Oscars.

us,Cabaret Has a New Lease but Can't Pay the Rent,"FROM the 1980's into the mid-90's, cabaret seemed to be breaking out everywhere. Singers of all generations, from the veteran Julie Wilson to the baby boomer Karen Akers, had combined with musicians, songwriters and promoters to create a giddy scene. Tony Bennett was a hit with the MTV set, and clubs offering the magic of an intimate evening of music, dinner and candlelight were springing up in New York and elsewhere. The Algonquin, the Russian Tea Room, Tavern on the Green and the Cafe Carlyle were pillars of the new circuit. But if the cabaret renaissance had a flagship, it was the shiny Rainbow and Stars, where, 65 floors above Rockefeller Center, star performers like Rosemary Clooney and Vic Damone vied with the view for the attention of the tourists, well-heeled New Yorkers and celebrities who frequented the place.",1998-10-18T05:00:00+0000

In Gatsby-esque fashion, the host was mysterious and fabulously wealthy, and he wasn't even there. Rupert Murdoch was in London on other business, as if to show, ever haughtily, that his takeover of big-time sports in America wasn't sufficient cause to merit his actual presence. He wasn't there, but in a way he was -- his live image was projected on a giant screen as if he were Big Brother. Framing his ominous mug shot were a proliferation of smaller screens, each showing a different sports contest that was being telecast live by Murdoch's empire.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Chang Chuckified,"Susan Choi's first novel, THE FOREIGN STUDENT (Harper Flamingo, $23), is a richly detailed exploration of a young man's escape from the nightmare of a country torn by war. During a stint as a translator for the American information services in Seoul, a young Korean named Chang Ahn is caught up in the political turmoil and forced into a life on the run. By August 1955, two years after the cease-fire has ended the war, Chang has managed to emigrate to the United States, where he attempts to settle into the life of a scholarship student in the university town of Sewanee, Tenn. Yet he is unprepared for the smallest shocks of a vastly different world: even the realization that people in Sewanee go to sleep at night without locking their doors is unnerving. Choi (herself the daughter of a Korean immigrant father) catches such moments under a very clear glass, wisely resisting the urge to embellish. Instead, she allows the story to blossom slowly after Chang (renamed Chuck) makes his first real friend in America: Katherine Monroe, his 28-year-old neighbor. Caught in a poisonous relationship with a popular professor, begun while she was only 14, Katherine is nearly as wounded as Chuck. Together they begin to heal, not with the dreamy pleasure of romantic young lovers but tentatively and painfully, mindful of all that has gone wrong in their lives -- and all that might still go wrong. Moving from the present to the past, from America to Korea, Choi brings hundreds of small scenes to life, then uses them to construct an intricate portrait of lovers who must also prove (to themselves and others) that they are survivors.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; It's Not Over Till Everybody Sings,"Opera is an art form that has always required the collaboration of many different kinds of people, all of them, to judge by THE STORY OF OPERA (Abrams, $49.50), at least a little neurotic. About Mlle. de Maupin (1673?-1707), a famous French contralto, for example, Richard Somerset-Ward, a former head of music and arts programming for BBC Television, writes, ''She made her debut as a 22-year-old in one of Lully's operas at the Academie, but by then she had (in no particular order) married, run away with a fencing master, taken vows as a nun in order to get into a nunnery to seduce a girl with whom she had fallen in love, and been condemned by a court in Avignon to be burned alive.'' This book, with a fascinating and handsome picture or two on every page, is a serious and lively history. The story begins in the late 16th century and continues up to the present, tracing the swervings toward and away from drama that are the form's essence. Plenty of mediocre operas have been composed for famous castrati and prima donnas, but the most important opera composers have always sought to involve the audience in a human drama by creating music that powerfully expresses the text. ''What changed in the 20th century was that opera finally became a genuine branch of theater,'' Somerset-Ward writes. ''The drama got on equal terms with the music.'' This book persuasively describes opera as a thriving, complex art that has never been more appealing than it is right now. Rick Whitaker",1998-10-18T05:00:00+0000
us,The League; David Stern's Full-Court Press,"Many of the National Basketball Association's best-known players gathered at Madison Square Garden in September for a charity exhibition game straight from the Last Days of Disco. Because of a labor dispute between the N.B.A. and the N.B.A. Players Association -- a dispute jeopardizing the coming season, which was set to begin Nov. 3 -- the game was held without the league's involvement, and it felt like 1978 all over again. Scoring was rampant and defense nonexistent. Low-tech music echoed off the walls, and there were none of the slick videos that fill dead time in today's N.B.A. arenas. The players' generic uniforms were unadorned by those cartoonish logos that drive souvenir sales. Most important, the Garden was only one-third full, a turnout more typical of N.B.A. games during the Carter Administration. The whole affair was a stark reminder of what pro basketball might have been without David Stern, the commissioner who has established a new paradigm for the marketing of sports.",1998-10-18T05:00:00+0000

''A Room'' is directly repetitive; ''Dream'' floats up and down in soft scale patterns. But minimalism, like the color orange, surely existed long before there was a name for it. Circling figuration is found in musical cultures from around the world, and if Bach or Handel were to return they would recognize familiar features in Mr. Glass's scores, which they might think to be eccentric passacaglias, rather long and lacking in variation.",1998-10-24T05:00:00+0000

Thus the short stories in this collection can be read as companion pieces to his novel ''Sea of Lentils'' and his book of essays ''The Repeating Island.'' Not surprisingly, this new volume (translated by James Maraniss) covers a wide historical range, from the 16th century to the mid-20th; some of the material is based on actual records, some has been fictionalized to resemble fact. Here Benitez-Rojo chronicles events of unremitting and often unspeakable horror -- slave trading, invasions, mutinies, rebellions, murders. His stories are dense with disaster and rich in description. The characters seem to exist only in extremis, dying in despondency and despair or in false glory. They are either mysterious and foreign to one another or brothers in suffering. Ambition motivates them all -- hypocritical priests, opportunistic scoundrels, even a few doomed romantics. In Benitez-Rojo's view, the truth is often more contradictory and confusing than fiction, and in both it is difficult to tell the defeats from the triumphs, the pious from the godless, the honorable from the unworthy. History is what is written down, an orderly procession of events leading to a specific outcome -- to a duel, to the establishment of trade, to the political division of an island. These stories persuasively present the improbable swirl of action out of which that history is confidently fabricated. Barbara Fisher",1998-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,PULSE: HALLOWEEN EDITION; Hot Pink Puppies,"Going beyond silly hats and sunglasses for their pets, owners are now trotting out animals who have had their fur dyed. They have been turning to Eric Gonzalez, owner of Urban Pets on Christopher Street, New York's top -- and perhaps only -- fur colorist. The Brad Johns of the pet world, Mr. Gonzalez turns white poodles aqua, golden labs green and white cats pink. Most of his regular clientele are models, but this month he has also answered pet-dipping requests for nonworking pets. ''A woman brought her white dog in and asked me to make it look like a cow for trick-or-treating,'' he said. The process, which uses safe vegetable dyes and costs $45 to $85, works best on light-colored animals and does not wash out easily, ''though the hot pink fades to a nice cotton-candy color,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. Ruth Voorhies, a fashion-show producer, had her Maltese, Mags, dyed fuchsia for a video by Total, a female rhythm-and-blues group. Ms. Voorhies was aghast when she first saw her hot-pink puppy; now she thinks Mags should go safety orange for Halloween. ''I just hope it fades by Thanksgiving,'' said Ms. Voorhies, who goes home for the holidays and does not want to frighten her 93-year-old grandmother. CHRISTINE MUHLKE",1998-10-25T05:00:00+0000

It is no longer enough for parents to rush their toddlers onto waiting lists for elite nursery schools.

''We used to put the costumes out in early October,'' said Steven Nauman, manager of Zittles, the toy department at Zitomer Pharmacy on Madison Avenue and 76th Street. ''This year, they were on the floor the second week in August -- and right away, people bought them like crazy.'' And while a sellout means big-time disappointment, he added, ''The kids are usually more flexible than the moms.'' Case in point: a tug of war that erupted between two mothers over a $40 Teletubbies costume (above). ''One mother charged over and snatched it out of the other mother's hand,'' Mr. Nauman said. ''When the shouting really escalated, we had to intervene.'' Pickings are now slim: some M&M's, plenty of Godzillas. ''If I can't find something, I might order from a catalogue,'' said Rachel Wolf, an Upper East Side mother.

What these homeowners fail to realize is that the majority of burglars have no way of knowing what is inside a home. Most break in hoping to get lucky.

us,Trip-Hop Reinvents Itself to Take on the World,"WHEN Massive Attack came on the British dance-music scene in 1991 with its debut album, ''Blue Lines,'' the group's bass-heavy beats and brooding spirit of introspection became the sonic blueprint for trip-hop. A studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and reggae that set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead and Tricky, trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware, culturally fragmented times. Spawned by the latest recording technologies, yet resolutely human in its message, it was steeped in the ironic film-noir paranoia of 60's spy movies and apocalyptic angst.",1998-10-25T05:00:00+0000

She interfaced for him with an IBM PS/1 his publisher had talked him into buying. She set up the defaults, rearranged the icons, programmed the style formats, accessed the ANSI character sets--Bech was a stickler for foreign accents. When he answered a letter, she typed it for him from dictation. When he took a creative leap, she deciphered his handwriting and turned it into digitized code. Neither happened very often. Bech was of the Ernest Hemingway save-your-juices school. To fill the time, he and Robin slept together. He was seventy-four, but they worked with that. Seventy-four plus twenty-six was one hundred; divided by two, that was fifty, the prime of life. The energy of youth plus the wisdom of age. A team. A duo. ",1998-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: University Presses Nonfiction; Social Climbers With Claws,"Katharine M. Rogers recognizes the paradox of the cat: though we may live for years with our beloved pet, we may never truly know it. Instead, we are led to imagine. Perhaps we see in its searching stare a ''preternatural knowledge,'' in its stealthy movements a tendency toward artifice, or in its antiauthoritarian disposition a rejection of bourgeois values. In The Cat and the Human Imagination: Feline Images From Bast to Garfield (University of Michigan, $29.95), Rogers examines the progression of our cultural understanding of the cat. Her insightful exploration, which begins with ancient Egypt and ends with the present day, attempts to explain why and how certain artists and thinkers --among them Tintoretto, Poe, Dickens, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mark Twain, Baudelaire, Renoir and (of course) T. S. Eliot -- have embraced the image of the cat. Rogers charts the historical development of feline representations as the ''insignificant domestic animal'' becomes ''a treasured and mysterious companion.'' Her book catalogues not only artistic but also linguistic, folk and religious perspectives relating to cats. Threaded throughout are Rogers' arguments about why some people hate cats, why cats are ''successful rivals to dogs'' and why discussions of cats often ''slide automatically into comparisons with women.'' The book -- sheer catnip for the intellectual feline lover -- implies that whether we consider it a symbol of the home, a paragon of independence, an agent of evil or a cherished friend, the cat will remain in our cultural imaginings for centuries to come.

Survived by loving children Jay Lefkowitch, M.D., Shelley White, Amy Niles, Judith Abbott, Gregory Abbott, Dennis Abbott; sons and daughters-in-law Jeffrey Block and Barbara Abbott, David White and J. Herbert Niles, M.D.; grandchildren Mark, Lesley, Asa, Sam, Hannah; great grandchild Nathaniel. A graduate of City College of New York, he succeeded his father, Henry, as owner of Metro Music Company, 3rd Street and 2nd Avenue in New York City, which in its day was the largest publisher of Jewish music worldwide. A versatile musician, he played clarinet and saxophone and several other instruments, was an arranger and knew what it was to be a ''side man'' and orchestra contractor during and after World War II. For most of the past two decades, until his retirement at age 80 last year, he brought his considerable musical expertise, particularly in classical music, to the Sam Ash Corporation in Paramus, N.J. He derived great pleasure from volunteering at the Allen Pavilion of ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center after retirement. He adored playing tennis and played tournaments throughout Westchester County. He loved travelling with his wife, Clarice, and shared her abundant enthusiasm for the symphony, the theatre and ballet. Fascinated with all things mechanical and technical, he also painted in oils and acrylic and designed covers for many of Metro Music's sheet music publications. A gentle and loving man with a wonderfully wry wit, he will always be carried in our hearts.
