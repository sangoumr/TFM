Given that only 13 percent of employees in the private sector in this country get any kind of compensated leave to care for young children, this was considered a laudable investment in sanity.

As a work of straight-up science fiction, imagining evolution out of whack and the climate in (more) acute crisis, the book represents something of a departure for Erdrich. But shes cooking with familiar ingredients: Ojibwe identity, the Minnesota landscape and  especially  sexual politics, as the government asserts a claim on pregnant womens bodies. I wanted to explore what a public creature you become when youre pregnant, how everybody puts their hands on you, Erdrich told Bethanne Patrick in The Los Angeles Times last month. Youre vulnerable to an extreme degree when youre pregnant. To that end, the novel grapples openly with questions of choice: not necessarily abortion, since Erdrichs pregnant heroine wants her baby, but with womens freedom to control their biological destiny. Its so obvious to me that anti-choice rhetoric isnt about religious faith, Erdrich told Patrick. Thats just a way for people to frame what theyre doing in a way that is palatable for them. Anti-choice is about controlling womens bodies period. Its about seizing control of young women.",2017-12-01T18:23:43+0000

The book is, no surprise, every bit as rowdy as the movie. Haddish grew up in foster care in South Central Los Angeles, and for a time had a job as an energy producer at bar mitzvahs, where she was paid to dance enthusiastically and encourage other guests to have a good time. (I was basically the Flava Flav of bar mitzvahs.) In one memorable chapter, she explains how that gig led to a sideline pimping out her male friends. If youre doing bar mitzvahs, youre going to meet old Jewish ladies, she writes. They started telling me how lonely they were and saying things like, My husbands not satisfying me. When one woman showed Haddish her collection of romance novels  She had one that was like a slave thing or whatever. It was a big, strapping black guy on the cover, holding this passed-out white woman  Haddish was inspired. I dont know any slaves, she told the woman, but I could probably hook you up with somebody big and strong. Word spread, and Haddish thrived until the men realized they could cut their own deals without her. Thats O.K. Shes found other ways to put her people skills to lucrative use.

For that reason, in 2014, a young defense lawyer named Alka Pradhan became a frequent guest on the channel.

For one project, she offered subjects a stay in a four-star hotel. After conducting some sham experiments, everyone went to bed only to be awakened before dawn by a call from the front desk telling them the building was on fire. This, of course, was the real experiment. In a fire, you need to evacuate quickly, but thats not what we see, Kobes says. Instead, people put on their shoes, got dressed, searched for their keys and repeatedly peered out their door into the hallway. Stalling before exiting is what evacuation researchers call the premovement phase. Dont prolong it.",2017-12-22T10:00:09+0000

Blockson. Given to him by Tubmans great-grandniece Mariline Wilkins (the daughter of Eva Stewart Northrup, whose signature is inscribed inside the books cover), it was just one of dozens of Tubmans belongings bequeathed to the museum that day. Eric Williams, the curator of religion at the Smithsonians Center for the Study of African American Religious Life, considers the book particularly revelatory, given that Tubman was illiterate. This idea of having a sacred book and not being able to read it, he said in a phone interview, thats a window into her piety. And it is in line with a longer tradition one finds in the black religious experience in North America. Although many black men and women, whether enslaved or free, could not read them, he explained, these books  the Bible and hymnals  bore witness to the liberating power of the Gospel contained within their pages. Williams told me that for Tubman, who could sing every word it contains, this hymnal would have been invested with a spiritual power, and that it is a text to be valued not just as literature but as artifact  as an object of devotion.
