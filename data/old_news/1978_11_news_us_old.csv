us,Screen: Avildsen's 'Slow Dancing':Rocky on the Hoof,"THE hero of ""Slow Dancing in the Big City"" looks like a plain, ordinary big lug, but in fact he's a well-known lug-about-town whose very name  Lou Friedlander  is enough to make people ooh and aah and hope to catch his eye. Lou, played by Paul Sorvino, is a Very Famous Columnist for The Daily News, and his specialties are overworking metaphors and writing about the little guy. The more upbeat the little guy, the better  not for nothing is Lou's column advertised as ""The Heart of the Apple."" As the movie begins, Lou is hard at work on the tale of a man who tried to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and the Eskimo named Comet who saved him. As Lou puts it, ""Who says Eskimos are a dying breed?""If you're planning to watch ""Slow Dancing in the Big City"" with the kind of beatific optimism Lou lavishes on all his subjects, then you'd better suppose  from the facts that he works in his underwear, has a desk littered with beer cans and calls a lovesick cleaning woman his ""muse""  that Lou is one great talent as well as one great guy.And you'll have to, as Lou himself might put it, turn the other cheek when the long arm of coincidence plants Sarah, an exotic hothouse flower of a dancer, in the relatively barren soil of Lou's brownstone. In other words, don't be surprised when this gorgeous, rich creature moves from her own palatial setup into a dreary cubbyhole across the hall from Lou.The script, chock-full of coincidences just this unlikely, has Sarah shrug about the grubbiness of the place and explain that she'll brighten it up when she brings a few things over. Sure enough, she later arrives with her parakeet, who has a clever name and lives in a very decorative cage.When John Avildsen was removed as the director of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" there were complaints that he had been trying to recreate his prior triumph by turning that film into a dancing ""Rocky."" This time, having hung onto his dream and come up with a ""Rocky"" in toe shoes, Mr. Avildsen demonstrates the same kind of pluck and endurance his characters have  Lou, Sarah, Rocky or even Orville (Mr.) Wright, the parakeet. So Rocky talked to turtles? So Lou and Sarah hope that one day Orville will be set free, to spread his wings and find his piece of the sky.Sarah is the Rocky-ette of the piece, because she has just one great performance in her, and she must sweat and strain to go the distance. But Sarah, as played by Anne Ditchburn, the Canadian dancer, is so beautiful that she doesn't have to say much about this, especially because Lou is on hand to supply the sentiment. ""I tellya, if we can beat the odds in New York, we can do anything  walk on the moon, kiss the stars, turn the garbage into roses,"" Lou enthuses, the first time he takes Sarah to dinner. ""You're a poet,"" she replies. ""You're beautiful,"" says he, bending forward to kiss her hand.Sarah's high-tone background is just evident enough to give the film a touch of class struggle, the better to establish that the Lou-Sarah romance is star-crossed while aiming the dance sequences at the ""Turning Point"" crowd. But Mr. Sorvino and Miss Ditchburn are so obviously mismatched that their incompatibility hardly needs special emphasis.Mr. Sorvino is perfectly plausible as a newsman. But when the screenplay finally rules out the possibility that Sarah merely regards him as a pal, it does him in. Miss Ditchburn, making her acting debut, is so glamorous and mystifyingly odd that she recalls the young Audrey Hepburn, but she, too, is sabotaged by the script. One character describes Sarah as ""a natural spellbinder ... she tries not to be  that only makes things worse."" This is not a helpful thing to say about a woman who never goes anywhere without the perfect strip of antique lace tied just-so, to flatter her perfect forehead.Clearly, Mr. Avildsen had better luck with ""Rocky"" than he's had this time, even though the material is similar enough to make comparisons inevitable. The formula's failure on its current go-round is a good deal less baffling than its first flush of success.""Slow Dancing in the Big City"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). The featured romance is pointedly sexless, but there is some strong language elsewhere in the film, particularly in a subplot about street kids. And Miss Ditchburn's rehearsal outfits have a way of slipping off her shoulders.",1978-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Dummy Takes Over in 'Magic':Wooden Handed,"""MAGIC"" looks like the year's most earnest effort to underestimate the intelligence of the public. The film, directed by Richard Attenborough and adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, is a no-frills, no-imagination reworking of the story about the ventriloquist who is taken over by his dummy. This is a fable you may fondly remember from the 1946 English film ""Dead of Night,"" or from the later, very stylish ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" television show.Among other things, the word ""magic"" should evoke the sleight-of-hand by which one's attention is skillfully diverted from seeing what is taking place  which is precisely what ""Magic"" lacks. Unless you resolutely make yourself stare at the theater's exit sign, it's impossible not to see the wheels moving around inside this small, cumbersome movie.It's the sort of entertainment in which the most bizarre spectacle is the casting of that fine English actor, Anthony Hopkins, as a failed Catskill magician who suddenly hits the big time when he adds ventriloquism to his act. Equally fanciful is the casting of the irrepressible Ann-Margret  a personality for whom Las Vegas would have had to be invented had it not already existed  as the frumpy, off-season proprietor of a run-down Catskill camp, a woman whose love for the ventriloquist precipitates the movie's not-so-dread climax.The only actor in the cast who seems comfortable is Burgess Meredith, who plays a high-powered agent. He is unfortunately murdered early on when the ventriloquist suspects that the agent suspects that the ventriloquist has an unhealthy dependency on his foul-mouthed dummy. Would such suspicions be grounds for anything more than harsh words or, perhaps, advice? Not in any other movie, but ""Magic"" is even more desperate than its characters.Mr. Hopkins is top good an actor to be completely lost in this nonsense, but the best he can do is convince us of his intentions, to represent a timid soul in need of his dummy's identity. We believe none of it for a minute, partly because Mr. Goldman's screenplay spends too much time on irrelevant details, including flashbacks and jumps forward that neither inform nor amuse but simply look trendy in the dated fashion of that word.Mr. Attenborough (""A Bridge Too Far,"" ""Oh, What a Lovely War"") once made an effectively eerie film called ""Seance on a Wet Afternoon."" ""Magic"" is neither eerie nor effective. It is, however, very heavy of hand.",1978-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Whether Mr. Thornburgh follows Mr. Dewey into presidential remains to be seen, but his victory immediately ranks him as one of his party's bright new lights. The new Governor won his reputation as the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania when he threw a motley lot of local politicians into jail for various offenses. Then came a tour as an Assistant Attorney General, but when he returned home and began his campaign, he found that, politicians do not live by press clippings alone. Pennsylvania's rich Republican families, from the Melions to the Heinzes, tossed in 57 varieties of campaign contributions, and his multimilliondollar war chest bought him an exceptionally wellorganized campaign operation. But the Yaletrained lawyer also showed a good political touch. At a cattle auction in Lancaster in the last few weeks he worked the crowd with easy cameraderie and would have stayed all day if his aides had not pulled him on to the next stop. Now Mr. Clean has a chance to scrub down the statehouse in Harrisburg. And national kingmakers will be watching to see if he can - make it sparkle.",1978-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Gilroy's 'Once in Paris':All Abroad,"THOUGH its hero, a high-powered screenwriter, travels by Concorde, Frank D. Gilroy's ""Once in Parts"" appears to be a tale out of the comparatively nave, propeller-driven 1950's rather than the more jaded, jet-propelled 1970's, the period when it's all supposed to take place. The movie, which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a sweet-natured, gentle comedy about a happily married, almost incredibly innocent American who, while on a script-fixing assignment in Paris (which he has never seen before), has the kind of picturesque adventure that, I suspect, was much more believable when Paris was a week (or at least a day) away from New York, instead of a mere three and one-half hours.""Once in Paris"" is obviously a labor of a great deal of love, which is also what the film is all about. Mr. Gilroy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright (""The Subject Was Roses"") and film writer-director (""Desperate Characters,"" ""From Noon Till Three""), produced as well as wrote and directed ""Once in Paris."" In addition, he is apparently tending to the film's distribution himself. After his stylish and witty ""From Noon Till Three"" (one of the few Charles Bronson movies not to make a fortune) was more or less dismissed by its distributor, he wants, as he has reportedly said, to make his own mistakes.""Once in Paris"" is not a mistake, but it's too innocent and too without guile for its own good. Like its writer-hero, Michael Moore, played by Wayne Rogers (of the ""M*A*S*H"" and ""City of Angels"" television series), ""Once in Paris"" discovers movie clichs with a sense of wonderment we seldom share. Though Michael may never have been to Paris before, most of the rest of us have, if only in the movies.The first thing that happens to Michael is that he is taken in hand by a colorful native, whom such movies present as a tour guide or a taxi driver or a panhandler but always as a figure of comic wisdom. In this case the native is a pushy, know-it-all chauffeur named Jean-Paul, played by Jack Lenoir, a French actor of singularly little charm. Next, Michael meets Susan, the woman every man dreams of meeting in Paris while on temporary leave of domestic obligations. As played by Gayle Hunnicutt, Susan is smashing  an Englishwoman of beauty, intelligence and, best of all (thinks Michael), no wish for permanent attachments.In the mornings Michael and Susan take care of their career duties  she has ""an interest in a department store"" somewhere. In the afternoons they go sightseeing  the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Tuileries gardens, the flower markets, etc. There are also picnics on the grass, cozy meals at undiscovered restaurants, glimpses of the city at dawn from the Trocadero and, in between, love, love, love.Mr. Rogers has a good, substantial, amused screen personality that is of great benefit to the film, and he and Miss Hunnicutt make an appealing couple. If Mr. Lenoir is less successful, it may be that the character is essentially off-putting. Small, ragged, adolescent hustlers in bombed-out cities are, if not socially acceptable, then understandable. Middle-aged fellows playing the same game are sometimes called pimps.That may be to take ""Once in Paris"" more seriously than Mr. Gilroy ever intended. The film means to be a romantic lark, but this lark seldom becomes airborne.",1978-11-09T05:00:00+0000

There is doubt that his package of voluntary wageprice guidelines, wage insurance and a stiff dose of fiscal and monetary restraint can work without a slide into recession. But given the alternatives, there should be little doubt that the risk worth taking. Inaction would only guarantee recession, and a deeper one at that.",1978-11-10T05:00:00+0000

The adapter as well as director is the innovative Rumanian Andrei Serban, in his first attempt at writing a play. Although this is a lowbudget, workshop pkoduction, scheduled for a limited number of free performances, it has an epic scale matching that of the original book. In its barest outline, this Faus- tian novel-as-play deals with the visit of the Devil to Moscow. The full title of Mr. Serban's dramatization is The Master and Margarita (in Moscow, or the Gospel According to the Devil).",1978-11-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Movies: Rocky Goes to Limbo in 'Paradise Alley':Rocky as Wrestler,"SYLVESTER STALLONE needs help. If he continues to write, direct and star in movies like ""Paradise Alley,"" the career that only really began with ""Rocky"" may turn out to have been an extremely brief dream. He won't be going the course.""Paradise Alley,"" which opens at three theaters today, is a phony, attitudinizing, self-indulgent mess, a multimillion-dollar B (for boring) picture with the ear of a cauliflower, the heart of a hustler and the soul of a used-car salesman. It's so gross it's almost funny but, by not being funny, it makes one even more impatient than is absolutely necessary.If there had been just a tiny bit of wit involved, or a consistent point of view, or genuine feeling, ""Paradise Alley"" might have been an engaging throwback to the true B pictures of yesteryear. As it is, it's ""Rocky"" warmed over and then thrown out.Mr. Stallone's screenplay is set in New York's Hell's Kitchen in 1946, though it often looks like the Lower East Side in 1933 and San Francisco's Barbary Coast in 1890. In any case we get the idea it's a place people want to escape from  to go uptown or down town, as the geography might have it.There are three brothers, Italian Americans, trying to make a go of things. Cosmo (Mr. Stallone), the middle brother, wears a gold earring and his hair long, which he says are his trademarks. Cosmo is the con artist. Lenny (Armand Assante), the oldest brother, was wounded in world War II, and walks with a slight limp. Lenny works in an embalming parlor and is, in the language of such fiction, bitter at the world. Though the work is quiet and steady, there's no great future in embalming. The youngest brother, Victor (Lee Canalito), is a huge, immensely strong but gentle fellow, not unlike Lenny in ""Of Mice and Men.""In dramatizing the story of how Lenny and Cosmo attempt to promote Victor as a saloon wrestler to finance their way out of Hell's Kitchen, Mr. Stallone, the writer and director, introduces an assortment of eccentric and sentimental characters who seem to have been borrowed from other people's fiction. They include a small-time Irish hood, nicely played by Kevin Conway, who appeared with Mr. Stallone in ""F.I.S.T.,"" and Frank McRae, as a down-and-out black wrestler, the only actor in the movie with a decently funny and appealing scene.The women in the brothers' lives are a lovely, virtuous redhead (Anne Archer), who works in a dime-a-dance hall; a faithful whore (Joyce Ingalls) and a terrifically literate Chinese-American (Aimee Eccles) who cares about Victor enough to read him passages from the dictionary at night. She wants to improve his brain.The movie sort of coasts along from one predictable confrontation to another, bending characters to suit the plot, until the climactic wrestling bout on Christmas night when poor Victor must fight for a $9,000 purse.Mr. Stallone is no more interesting as a director than he is as an actor, nor does he have much sense of self-preservation. In ""Paradise Alley,"" bracketed by Mr. Canalito, who makes him look the size of Mickey Rooney, and by Mr. Assante, who gives indications of being a good actor, he becomes virtually invisible. Which isn't entirely bad.""Paradise Alley,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some scenes of violence in the wrestling arena and some mildly vulgar language.",1978-11-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Burton in 'Wild Geese,' Film About Mercenaries:African Big Horn","A movie that makes it impossible to tell whether Richard Burton's eyes are blue, green, pale gray or puce is a movie that has not been photographed properly. ""The Wild Geese,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State and other theaters, is just as bewildering about the shade of Richard Harris's hair, which looks chartreuse. Those parts of the film that are set in London appear to have been staged indoors, even if they weren't, in a makeshift studio lit with one or two fluorescent bulbs. The African sequences are so dim and grainy that they seem to be taking place inside a tea bag.Reginald Rose's screenplay may not provide the definitive account of mercenary soldiers in present-day Africa, but it deserved better treatment than this. Mr. Rose, whose credits include ""The Defenders"" television series and ""Twelve Angry Men,"" is an old-fashioned scenarist mindful of such old-fashioned niceties as pacing, clarity and economy. And his story gives each supporting character a memorable establishing line or two while still moving along at a brisk clip. There's actually quite an effective war movie lurking behind the unsightly facade of ""The Wild Geese.""The plot concerns a band of seasoned mercenaries hired by a wealthy British industrialist (Stewart Granger) to execute a mission in Africa. This tiny army, recruited by Mr. Burton, Mr. Harris and Roger Moore, is being sent to kidnap an African leader (Winston Ntshona) who has long been held prisoner and is believed by his followers to be dead. At the time the story starts, it suits Mr. Granger and his copper-mining interests to restore this leader to the public eye.But rich industrialists' interests have a way of changing. Things go swimmingly for Mr. Burton and his colorful, high-priced recruits until Mr. Granger decides, about an hour and a half into the story, to make a change in his plans. At this point, the faint-hearted would be well-advised to take themselves elsewhere, because the rest of the film is devoted to sickening, wholesale slaughter. There's no sex and not much profanity in ""The Wild Geese,"" but the film has an R rating. Let that serve as the warning it's supposed to be.Until ""The Wild Geese"" begins devoting itself solely to violence, it's well-suited to a general audience; that makes the change of mood particularly unfortunate. Andrew V. McLaglen, best known as the director of John Wayne's lesser westerns, spends the early part of the film alternating long shots with abrupt close-ups that don't match, but the caliber of the cast and the sparkle of the screenplay are enough to hold one's attention.Later, Mr. McLaglen does greater damage when he begins treating hordes of African soldiers, who out-number the mercenaries about 600 to 1, as if they were Indians at Little Big Horn. ""The Wild Geese"" is not about to address itself to the complexities of contemporary Africa  that becomes clear when the political hostage says ""If we have no future together, white man, we have no future, and quickly moves on to a less inflammatory subject. But it's a shame the film makers managed to travel so far without capturing even the faintest flavor of their story's exotic backdrop.",1978-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The exhi- bition that Diane Waldman has now organized at the Guggenheim;Museum  Mark Rothko, 19031970: A Retrospective  is the most complete survey of the man's work anyone has yet given us. In addition, the Pace Gallery has simultaneously mounted an exhibition of The 19581959 Murals, which have never before been shown as a group. These exhibitions by no means exhaust the entire Rothko oeuvre, but they do give us a very ample basis on which come to terms with the artist's accomplishment.

Many scientists believed  and still believe  that the study was flawed, but the Arneric,an Medical Association supported it and estimated that oral diabetes drugs caused 10,000 to 15,000 premature deaths a year.

us,Screen: 'Killer of Sheep' Is Shown at the Whitney:Nonprofessional Cast,"""KILLER OF SHEEP,"" which opens today at the Whitney Museum, is a film to make one mindful of the difference between genuinely abstract art and iciness for its own sake. The program notes say that Charles Burnett, the director, thinks the idea of the film ""is to try to recreate a situation without reducing life to a simple plot,"" but his film has just enough of a story to make it taxing.The action, which of course is hardly supposed to be action at all, revolves around a black man whose only measure of prosperity is the fact that he's well enough off to give things to the Salvation Army. He is remote and depressed. His wife is bored and sexually frustrated, and she's depressed, too.He has two children, whom we see eating breakfast and scratching and walking around the neighborhood. He has a lot of young and reasonably attractive male friends who live with grotesquely bloated women; sometimes the men get together and fix cars, or worry. The central character works in a slaughterhouse, hence the none-too-apt title.To all this monotony and alienation Mr. Burnett brings an estrangement of his own. The film consists of loosely linked glimpses of the characters' lives, punctuated by occasional cuts to the slaughterhouse. It is acted by non-professionals, who call attention to the falseness of many of the situations. It is beautifully photographed in black and white, and very spare.The dialogue, which is read with either insufficient or excessive emphasis by the nonactors, is often buried under a soundtrack of vintage blues, making it doubly hard to follow. Even the slaughter of the sheep is numbingly uneventful.That may be Mr. Burnett's very point, but he makes it so studiedly that the character's estrangement from his surroundings overlaps too conveniently with the director's arty detachment from his material.And for all its air of starkness, ""Killer of Sheep"" is more often arid than it is genuinely economical. Mr. Burnett obviously has a keen eye for tiny moments  the way a child pulls up a sock, the way a man's hands move on machinery  but he doesn't demonstrate the kind of coherence that might give them larger meaning.",1978-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,When a Turkey Puts Its Best Foot Forward,"ALMOST all holiday symbols are directly traceable to their origins. The Easter egg is attributable to pagan rites of spring and the season of rebirth; the custom of a Yuletide goose is almost certainly an offspring of that celebrated feast in Dickens's A Christmas Carol. No one knows precisely, however, when the turkey became the national bird for the Thanksgiving table. It is presumed that the serving of a roasted tom turkey, a gobbler, came into popularity about the beginning of the 19th century. As pointed out in a marvelously researched work on the Thanksgiving bird, The Wild Turkey by A.W. Schorger (University of Oklahoma Press), There is a widespread lief that from the first Thanksgiving in New England in 1621 this celebration became an annual affair and that turkey was always served. Not so, says the author. In the beginning, Thanksgiving was celebrated only on an irregular basis. The time of celebration was proclaimed by the heads of individual colonies or states. Thanksgiving first became a national holiday through a proclamation of President Lincoln, and it was celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November 1864. Since that time each successive President has followed his example. (Curiously, some Southern states had objected to the proclamation on the ground that it was a relic of Puritanic bigotry.) Perhaps the first official association of the holiday and turkey was made Alexander Hamilton, the statesman and first Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795. No citizen of the United States, he opined, should refrain from turkey on Thanksgiving Day.",1978-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Tolkien's trilogy. ""The Lord of the Rings,"" is both numbing and impressive.Yet it would be difficult to recommend this movie to anyone not wholly absorbed by the uses of motion-picture animation or to anyone not familiar with Tolkien's home-made mythology, which borrows liberally from various Norse myths, the Eddas, the Nibelungs and maybe even Beatrix Potter. In the way of grand opera sung in Urdu, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is likely to be total confusion to someone who doesn't speak the language.In 1956, Edmund Wilson said it very well in The Nation when he described Tolkien's trilogy as ""essentially a children's book which has somehow got out of hand."" To be exact, it's out of hand by half a million words plus indexes, appendixes, footnotes and maps.The three books, set in the mythological past of Middle Earth, recount an epic battle between good and evil, between heaven and hell, when the dark powers, in order to rule the world, attempt to recover a magic ring that has fallen into the possession of a heroic hobbit named Frodo. The cast of characters includes wizards (good and bad), dragons, men, elves, dwarfs, goblins and, of course, hobbits, which are sort of superdwarfs. Hobbits are smaller than the dwarfs of conventional fairy tales but they are jollier, heartier, cuter, braver and in general much more difficult to stomach than Sneezy, Sleepy, Doc, Dopey and the rest of that crowd.W.H. Auden and other pro-Tolkien critics have found in ""The Lord of the Rings"" comparisons to Milton, Dante and other epic-makers, and they may be right. I must admit that since I reached voting age I haven't been as fascinated by confrontations between good and evil (with the exception of ""Star Wars,"" which was funny) as I've been by attempts to cope with what Grace Paley identified as ""the little disturbances of man."" Until I can understand how Con Ed operates, heaven (and hell can wait.The movie, which opens today at the Ziegfeld Theater, includes material from the first two books of the trilogy. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers,"" and ends more or less in mid-crisis (after more than two hours) with the screen message, ""Here con-cludes the first part of the history of the War of the Ring."" It's not a movie for the child (or adult) who has yet to conquer his need for instant gratification. Mr. Bakshi is, I'm told, already working on the second part utilizing the third book, ""The Return of the Ring."" You are thus warned to have some kind of explanation ready for your child when the movie ends without actually ending. If the child is my age, watch out that he doesn't rip up a seat.The major fault of the screenplay by Chris Conkling and Peter S. Beagle is that the film attempts to cover too much ground too quickly, packing in more incomprehensible exposition in the first 15 minutes than you'd get in a year of ""All My Children."" I know one 12-year-old Tolkien scholar, who otherwise thoroughly approved of the movie, who was disappointed because a lot of the events of the books had been ''simplified"" in the movie. This comment prompted a certain amount of awe among a small group of adults who'd had difficulty following the simplified material.After some introductory information about the origin of the magic ring, the film settles down to attend to the adventures of the hobbit named Frodo as he attempts to return the ring to Mount Doom, in the land of Modor, where the ring was cast and can be destroyed, in this way to keep it out of the clutches of the evil Sauron. Frodo's companions on his quest include a wise wizard named Gandalf; a faithful, comic servant named Sam, and other assorted types with such names as Aragorn, Boromir, Merry and Pippin. There are terrible goblins called ores, and one very skinny, ugly, unreliable, obsequious, completely winning creature named Smeagol, who is a gollum.As in all his films, Mr. Bakshi, attempts to go beyond the limits of movie animation as we know it. Before he and his staff began the actual animation, he shot most of his script with live actors in Spain (where else?) and used this material as a guide for the animators. Some of this original material appears to have been incorporated into the finished production, though it has the look of video tape that has been electronically altered to give it an unworldly, unfilmlike quality. Sometimes this is most effective; at other times it simply looks like badly developed film stock. Still, the film is visually compelling even when murk overtakes the narrative.If Tolkien was not above quoting the mythology of others, Mr. Bakshi appears to have had his own fun quoting such films as ""2001,"" ""Ivan the Terrible."" ""Henry V"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" His hobbits look very much like Disney dwarfs, though somewhat more introspective, and not once does anyone waste time wishing on a star. The War of the Ring is serious business, and the movie seldom makes light of it, which is something parents should keep in mind.""The Lord of the Rings,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains much fantastic material that could frighten very small children or confuse those less susceptible to nightmares.",1978-11-15T05:00:00+0000

The meteors resemble intergalactic lint, and the earth, as seen from afar, is a big, blue volleyball with eczema. The space-walk special effects are straight out of ""Peter Pan.""The beleaguered people of the planet Jillucia wear wreaths of plastic leaves around their foreheads and travel in a vehicle that looks like the Flying Dutchman with a battery pack. The surface of Jillucia is made up of big gray hunks of papier-mch. The spaceships are so obviously miniatures that it becomes fun to imagine what would have happened if a real live mouse had wandered into the frame. The mouse would have looked like Rodan.However, the plot of ""Message From Space,"" which opens today at Loews State and 86th Street East theaters, is pleasantly indecipherable, and the screenplay seems to have passed through a food processor with a sense of humor. Wicked old crone describing the mountains near her home: ""And then there is the wolves who roam about very hungry at this time of year."" Madcap heiress with spunk, ex-plaining why she has decided to follow the Jillucians to their new planet after the old one has been demolished: ""Because I feel my life would have some purpose there.""If you were spinning your television dial at 1 A.M. and happened upon ""Message From Space,"" you would undoubtedly consider it as lively as it is preposterous, a real find; whether you would stay tuned for an hour and three quarters is another matter. On the big screen, it's worth recommending to anyone who won't mind a movie that looks as though it costs less than his or her ticket. And, for archivists with an interest in the all-time worsts, here is a ""Star Wars"" knockoff that looks less like the original than most television commercials for new cars. Here is a tale of intergalactic intrigue that revolves around magical walnuts. Here is a real contender.""Message From Space"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

He has never lost that 'status, and there are contented collectors all over Europe and in both the Americas who can confirm it. But he is not by nature a showman, and his work in recent years has become more and more weightless and incorporeal. People suppose  however irrationally  that a painting that looks like a kite and hangs from the ceiling is not as serious as a painting that comes in a big gold frame and hangs on the wall. Furthermore, Mr. Smith's works are hard to reproduce since they depend both on a particularly precise and delicate sense of color and on a physical structure, part painting and part relief, that must be investigated the way we investigate a bird's nest. The work has, literally, to be seen to be believed; and it has not been properly seen in New York for some time, even though the Museum of Modern Art does from time to time show a shaped canvas that is one of Mr. Smith's more forthright achievements.",1978-11-17T05:00:00+0000

Surprisingly strong and melodious, La Pasionaria's 82yearold voice suddenly opened in song, an old revolutionary song that floated across the smokefilled convention hall and silenced a thousand Communist delegates waiting for a broken computer to be fixed and give them the voting results for the new central committee.

Dolores Ibarurri watched as another generation of Communists, impatient with waiting for the tallies, put on an impromptu amateur hour: rhymed Aragonese jotas, some sung in praise of the party; a few dirty jokes; a funny imitation of Santiago Carrillo's windy oratory; a stringy Valerian's song, in Catalan, whose longlive refrain struck some as a bit irreverent for a congress that had just abandoned Leninism as a guiding tenet: Visca Lenin! Visca Marx! Visca Liberia!! Finally, a jovial Basque took the microphone and got the whole congress to hum along to a boisterous tune which ended with everyone throwing spare articles of clothing and copies of the party's 15 theses toward the high ceiling of the Melia Castilla Hotel.

us,Film: 'Same Time':Trysting Annually,"THERE'S a big stumbling block in Bernard Slade's play ""Same Time, Next Year,"" and the movie version trips and goes flying. What keeps these two lovers  who meet accidentally in a romantic little inn and then keep on meeting there, one night annually, for 20-odd years  eternally interested in each other? How do they manage to stay so gaga and still live peacefully with their spouses? How do they forget each other so conveniently when each anniversary tryst is over? At the best, this premise is full of terribly sad implications for the characters and their everyday lives. At worst, it stops an audience dead by calling constant attention to the play's falseness.If ""Same Time. Next Year,"" which opens today at Cinema I, were a success as a comedy, this patently phony pretext wouldn't necessarily hurt; indeed; its very outlandishness might become part of the joke. But Mr. Slade's screenplay isn't often funny, and it's full of momentous events that can't be laughed away.During the half-dozen encounters that make up the story, there are a birth, some deaths, two guilty consciences and countless marital problems to be contended with. For instance, when we see them in 1966, George (Alan Alda) is a straitlaced businessman, and Doris (Ellen Burstyn) a very premature hippie. They have begun to have a domestic quarrel about Barry Goldwater when George blurts out that his son was killed in Vietnam; this is supposed to both melt Doris (it does) and explain the drastic change in George. It's hard to say which is more noxious, Mr. Slade's wringing a cheap tear out of his audience or his burdening a cardboard character with real grief.As directed by Robert Mulligan, who has careened about 180 degrees away from his last film, the screamy and high-strung ""Bloodbrothers,"" ""Same Time, Next Year"" is both less and more than it could have been. By moving the action outdoors once in a while, or into the inn's restaurant, Mr. Mulligan loses the element of claustrophobia that might have taken an audience's mind off the screenplay's troubles. But he substitutes the serenity of a California coastal setting, and gives the film a visual glamour that is mercifully distracting. Mr. Mulligan seems to have been more interested in sprucing up the material than in preserving its absolute integrity, and under the circumstances, his approach makes sense.What sells ""Same Time, Next Year"" on stage, and what keeps the movie halfway afloat, is the chance it gives George and Doris to change with the times. Not much happens to George, relatively speaking. He evolves from young Lothario to stodgy executive to know-it-all analysand, and always stays something of a straight man to Doris. She, on the other hand, changes from ingenue to sexpot to pregnant frump to successful businesswoman with a logic that has more to do with costuming than with character. These shifts have such slight bearing on one another that the story becomes little more than a series of blackout sketches. But the scenes' very incongruity is funnier than any one episode is individually, and clearly the actors have a lot to play with.Mr. Alda isn't terribly playful, and he reads every line as if it were part of a joke, which only accentuates the flatness of the script. Miss Burstyn, on the other hand, is the eternal coquette, even when  in the latter part of the film  she begins looking like Betty Ford. Her gestures vary absolutely from scene to scene, yet she brings so much sweetness to Doris's various incarnations that the character very nearly comes to life. Miss Burstyn never tries to make sense of the role, and she often undercuts what little sense there is; her 24-year-old Doris, for instance, is so demure it's impossible to believe she ever succumbed to George's charms in the first place. But she gives the role a warmth and grace that become quite an adequate substitute for reason.""Same Time, Next Year"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") thanks to the intimations of tawdriness in the characters' annual hotel-room reunions.",1978-11-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Movie Movie' Satirizes 30's Styles:Hollywood Flimflam,"""THESE hands,"" says Joey Popchik, the delivery boy who wants to become a lawyer, ""are for reading books."" But fate and the Great American Depression interfere. Joey's kid sister, Angie, is going blind. ""It's okay, Joey."" Angie says, ""I've seen a lot already. I'll remember.""The only way Angie can be cured is to go to Vienna for an operation that will cost $25,000, which comes to approximately $12,500 an eye, as one observer carefully calculates. Where to get the money? Joey must put aside his books and become a prizefighter. Thus begins the event-crammed, dopily heroic plot of ""Dynamite Hands,"" the first half of Stanley Donen's sweet, hilarious, very witty recollection of the sort of movie programs that came off the Hollywood assembly lines in the 1930's.In addition to ""Dynamite Hands,"" ""Movie Movie"" includes a breathless trailer for a movie about World War I flying aces, ""Zero Hour,"" ""war at its best!"" and, as the top feature on the program, ""Baxter's Beauties of 1933,"" a full-color  ""Dynamite Hands"" is in black-and white  triumphantly nutty backstage musical that Warner Baxter, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers might well have made. Instead, we have the great good fortune to have George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Art Carney, Red Buttons, Eli Wallach, Barry Bostwick and Rebecca York. These actors, many of whom also appear in ""Dynamite Hands,"" represent one of the happiest poolings of resources since Balaban met Katz.""Movie Movie,"" opening today at the Sutton Theater, was written by Larry Gelbart, who was responsible for ""Sly Fox,"" Mr. Scott's most recent Broadway hit, and Sheldon Keller. It seems so effortlessly funny that I suspect that the real intelligence and discipline that guide the project will be overlooked.Mr. Gelbart and Mr. Keller not only appreciate the comic uses of the mixed metaphor  one that is driven into the ground to the bursting point  but, more importantly, they have recreated the efficiency and manic, upbeat innocence of those Depression pictures. This has to do with more than screen styles  wacky montages and attention-getting wipes and fades, which anyone can imitate.The movie's spirits are high even when its eyes are filled with tears. The film makers genuinely like their models. When Joey Popchik says, ""How do you get two cents back on a heart,"" after he realizes he's been played for a sucker by a hardboiled nightclub singer, the writers are recollecting movie manners to which we still respond. People in 30's movies never talked quite this fruitily so consistently. The point is that this is the way we enjoy remembering them, to remind us, perhaps wrongly, that we've grown up.Mr. Donen's production is his most buoyant film since ""Singin"" in the Rain,"" and goes a long way toward erasing the memory of things like ""Lucky Lady,"" ""The Little Prince"" and ""Staircase."" For the most part, the timing is as precisely right as in one of those rare Broadway musicals in which everything works perfectly. Nothing is held too long. When we anticipate a gag, it is funnier simply because we do anticipate it, and then it is frequently topped.The performers are marvelous. Mr. Bostwick (of Broadway's ""The Robber Bridegroom"") is a standout as the mild-mannered bookkeeper who, in the nick of time, turns out to be a singer, dancer and composer of hit songs in ""Baxter's Beauties."" Miss York is most comically earnest in the Ruby Keeler role in the same film, with terrific support from Barbara Harris, who plays the Ginger Rogers-Glenda Farrell part.The newcomers who light up ""Dynamite Hands"" include Harry Hamlin, in the William Holden-John Garfield role; Ann Reinking as ""Troubles"" Moran, the nightclub singer with the rhinestone heart, and Kathleen Beller, as the poor girl with the mysterious eyesight problems. Messrs. Carney, Wallach and Buttons show up in each film, as well as in the ""Zero Hour"" trailer. They appear to have had a picnic, which they share.Mr. Scott and Miss Van Devere are superb in both ""Dynamite Hands"" and ""Baxter's Beauties."" In the first, she is Joey Popchik's bespectacled librarian-sweetheart, only temporarily eclipsed by the acquisitive ""Troubles"" Moran, and in the second, she's the big Broadway actress whose drinking problem allows the chorus girl to become an overnight star. It's high praise to say Miss Van Devere is as funny and appealing as she was in ""Where's Poppa?""Mr. Scott is such a powerful actor that it's always a surprise he can be so wickedly funny when he puts his mind to it. It's more than a physical transformation, which anyone can accomplish with a bit of makeup. There's a change in his center of gravity. As ""Gloves"" Malloy, the trainer who grooms Joey Popchik for the title bout, he is a model for all slightly too colorful, unbearably wise and sentimental old character actors. In ""Baxter's Beauties"" he is the grandly stylish ""Spats"" Baxter, the legendary Broadway producer whose only real problem is that he has been struck down by something called Spencer's Disease, another mysterious ailment without many symptoms, but which seems to strike people in show business quite regularly. All of which is why ""Spats"" has to get his last show on in a hurry and make sure that it's a hit.The appearance of ""Movie Movie"" at this point in a dreary season restores my confidence in the joys to be had from Hollywood flimflamming at its elegant best.""Movie Movie,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a couple of benignly funny double entendres that are probably out of the reach of any child who could be shocked by them.",1978-11-22T05:00:00+0000

The new work was directed by the chieftain of the National, Peter Hall, who regularly stages Mr. Pinter's plays in the icy, immobile style they have perfected together. The play is concerned, not for the first time in Mr. Pinter's case, with a triangular relationship  on this occasion husband, wife and wife's lover. But this time there are no ambiguities. Mr. Pinter fills us in on the details of the relationship by the simple means of presenting us with a series of flashbacks, taking us from the end of the affair to its beginning.

Stalin defended him but was dwarfed by him. He was preeminent as an orator, a critical writer on a wide variety of themes, a historian and, above all, as a social and political thinker. Two books devoted to Trotsky's ideas have just appeared. Baruch Kneipaz has immersed himself in the vast corpus of Trotsky's writings, published and unpublished, and produced a long and erudite analysis of every aspect of his thought. Irving Howe, constricted within the limits of the Modern Masters series, has written an excellent short account that he calls a political essay.

On the other hand. they are not quite the autonomous and selfsufficient verbal constructs that her esthetic position would seem to advocate. They are chockfull of reference to the exhausted world we inhabit; they abound in meaning  meaning that calls not for interpretation but for small, repeated sighs of recognition. All of them bear the impress of an active, questing intelligence that can apply language with neurosurgical skill to isolate and cut away the necrotic tissues of our collective modern consciousness. Some are decidedly more successful than others. Project for a Trip to China is an autobiographical reverie that is well enough written in the selfcatechising mode Miss Sontag uses in several pieces, but it is so reso!utely unfictional that I can see no reason for its inclusion in this collection. American Spirits (the erotic career of Miss Flatface, a young woman of irreproachable white Protestant ancestry) and Doctor Jekyll (an eccentric updating of the Stevenson tale) are both fables in which the demonstration of theme becomes much too mechanical  as it does in Baby (the wellmeant mutilation of a male child by its parents), where the pilingon of psychological clichs of a Southern California variety amounts finally to overkill.

us,Headliners,"Perhaps because public and private scandals in Britain are usually wrapped in a blanket of propriety and strict libel laws, British political misdeeds, like British murders, tend to appear unusually titillating. Such was the case last week when Jeremy Thorpe, once leader of the Liberal Party, went before a magistrates court to determine if he must stand trial in conspiracy to murder Norman Scott, a former male model who claims to have once been his lover. Mr. Thorpe is accused of having paid $20,000 in 1975 to have Mr. Scott killed, after trying to persuade political associates to do the job. According to prosecution witnesses, Mr. Scott had for many years been threatening to reveal a homosexual relationship with the Liberal leader, and Mr. Thorpe was desperate to get rid him. The murder plot reportedly went awry when the wouldbe killer's gun jammed. Mr. Thorpe has denied all charges, well as Mr. Scott's claims. Whether or not the case goes trial, and whatever the verdict in such a trial, Mr Thorpe's oncebrilliant career seems to have been destroyed, and with it the recent hopes of the Liberal Party to return as a significant political force.",1978-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Its narrator, Jack; is a 15yearold English boy so sunk in selfloathing that there are long stretches when he can't even be bothered to bathe or brush his teeth. Jack's father is a crabbed, oppressive man whose greatest priae is a tightly constructed garden of plaster, plastic, rocks and widely spaced tulips; his mother is not much more than a shadow, and their neighborhood is a wasteland of abandoned prefabs. Life here seems smothered, flattened. For Jack, his two sisters and his little brother, the only pleasures are those that erupt beneath a rigid surface: some rather joyless sexual games and a few stolen moments of willful disobedience. The Cement Garden describes the process that steadily isolates these four children, until they're so absolutely alone and so at odds with the rest of the world that there is no way of returning to normal life. First their father dies, and then their mother. The loss of their mother leaves them without relatives; so to avoid being separated they keep her death a secret and bury her in a trunkful of wet cement in the basement. From then on, it's all regression and decay. Garbage spills across the kitchen floor, food rots and flies swarm. The cement in the basement develops a crack and the presence of the body becomes increasingly obvious. Tom, the little brother, first transforms himself into a girl and then Into a baby in a crib, and Jack and his older sister develop a sexual relationship that makes them seem, paradoxically, almost as infantile as Tom. Even the neighborhood grows starker, as the prefabs crumble and fall away. By the end, we're left with tour stripped, empty characters and not a shred of hope.",1978-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Shelley wrote revolutionary tracts and Brooke joined the Fabians; and Mr. Spender, through a long creative life, has been a politically engaged writer. Yet in spite of his political commitments, he has remained what he always was  a romantic individualist, valuing personal freedom and artistic creation, and seeking a Good Society in which individuals might flourish.

Right around the corner are clothes that emphatically point up a woman's body and natural curves. Shoulders are still emphasized, but so are breasts, waists, hips and legs. Clothes are clinging closer; skirts are getting skimpier and shorter; pants are even tighter and worn with high heels, and waistlines are being hugged in with belts or with darts and seaming. Nothing a woman wears has been left untouched by the new fashion wavefrom dippy, tipped hats to pretty, obvious jewelry, to delicate, saucy shoes. Even the colors for next spring are sunnier, and combined in unusual ways. The words that come to mind to describe these new clothes are flirtatious, feminine and sexy. And lighthearted, too, for in many of the new designs there is definitely a dash of humor, a sense that these are clothes not to be taken deadly seriously. Of course, as always, the range of interpretation of this new figureemphasizing silhouette spans the spectrum, going anywhere from the spirited inventive designs of Perry Ellis, to the subtle, Sybaritic designs of Calvin Klein or Giorgio Armani, to the almost outrageous inventions of Claude Montana or Karl Lagerfeld. But, for the woman who is interested in fashion, nothing is going to look deader or limper next spring than last spring's voluminous figNo doubt there will be some carping that these new clothes make women look like sex objects. While it is true that men are going to have a delightful time observing women in their new curvy clothes, it is also true that women who love to look like women are going to have a marvelous time wearing them.",1978-11-26T05:00:00+0000
