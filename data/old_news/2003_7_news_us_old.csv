The report, released by the statistics agency IBGE, said the country's gross domestic product totaled 344.3 billion reais ($120 billion) in the period, which was the first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. The figure was down 5 percent from the fourth quarter, which traditionally has the fastest growth of the year. The economy grew 15 percent from the first quarter of 2002 and economists expect the country's economy to grow at an annual rate of 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent this year if inflation subsides and the government can reduce interest rates. Exports in the most recent quarter rose to 61.7 billion reais from 34.2 billion reais a year earlier. Tony Smith (NYT)",2003-07-01T05:00:00+0000

PeopleSoft cited the damage to its business in a lawsuit filed last month. The company's $65 million project to install financial software for the government of Los Angeles County has been suspended over concern that Oracle would not support the programs, a county official said. Other clients have also said they were concerned about losing their investments in PeopleSoft products. Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, has vowed to back PeopleSoft's products for at least a decade. But the company also said it would encourage customers to switch to its products. Oracle offered $19.50 a share for PeopleSoft last month to secure its No. 2 ranking behind SAP in sales of software for business tasks like payroll and accounting.

A company spokesman, Chris Hardman, said it was the second time that lenders had agreed to an extension. Qwest had been facing a July 15 deadline. Mr. Hardman said the waivers gave Qwest more time to restate earnings from 2000 and 2001. The waivers involve the company's Qwest Services Corporation credit center and a term loan to QwestDex, its phone directory unit. In February, Qwest released an unaudited 2002 statement that showed the company had lost $35.9 billion, or $21.35 a share, compared with a loss of $4.8 billion, or $2.88 a share, in 2001. The 2002 loss included a $30 billion goodwill reduction and $10.9 billion in asset impairments. Revenue in 2002 was $15.5 billion, down about 7 percent from $16.7 billion in 2001.

On July 1, 2003, at 10:30 PM, in Memorial Sloan - Kettering Hospital, Inger Bagger Stovall died peacefully surrounded by family members. She had been suffering from lung cancer, first diagnosed on April 8, 2003, according to her adoring husband of some 52 years, Robert H.

She became a U.S. citizen in 1996. Inger Stovall lived for 25 years in Mountain Lakes, NJ, with a seasonal home in Barnegat Light, NJ, for 19 years. Most recently she had resided in Sarasota, FL., with homes in Manhattan and Honesdale, PA, as well. Active in social work, she operated a Cheer Ring helpline service at Marble Collegiate Church for 20 years.

One of five children born to his immigrant parents in New York's fabled Lower East Side, he slowly but relentlessly worked his way up to being a prominent New York hotelier. Along the way, he taught English to immigrants at night school and helped assemble B-29 engines during WWII. Like many businesspeople who came of age during the Great Depression, he learned his hotel trade handson, making beds, running the switchboard, showing rooms and learning from others over a nickel coffee at the Automat. At one time, he owned major hotels in Chicago, Palm Beach, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., Baltimore as well as Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Costa Rica. Since the late 1950s, his great pride and joy was the Gramercy Park Hotel, which he owned and ran with one brief interruption, for almost forty years. It was truly a family operation - countless hotel employees had worked for him long past normal retirement age and his deep affection for them went well beyond business relationships. He repeatedly refused to sell the property despite handsome offers, explaining ''I have to take care of my people...where else can they find a job?'' This affection was mutual. His commitment to his own family knew no bounds, especially when it came to education. Seeing his children and grandchildren graduate from prestigious schools on their way to their own versions of the American dream gave him immense joy. His wife of fifty years, Ruth Weissberg, was very much his business partner and a loving wife who, like her husband, dotted on her children and grandchildren. He is survived by Ruth, three children, seven grandchildren and one great grandchild. For his family, hundreds of former employees and all those who knew him, his death a few weeks shy of his 91st birthday is truly the passing of an era.

Although he was the most renowned man in the promising valley of the Connecticut River, he knew that no mortal could guarantee the survival of the English on this beleaguered frontier. In 1703 the little towns stretched out along the river were not the peaceful New England villages of later postcards. Many of them looked more like armed garrisons, especially from Northampton north to Deerfield, the region most vulnerable to Indian attacks. Part of Northampton itself was surrounded by a stockade wall and the town was divided into ""military divisions.""

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Poems Well Built,"Give your debut collection of poems a title like HAMMER (Sarabande, paper, $12.95; cloth, $20.95) and you are all but promising a poetry of blunt, direct and forceful language. Mark Turpin's poems, most of which are set on the job sites of the home construction industry and peopled by the carpenters and backhoe operators who work there, deliver on that promise. Turpin has worked in the building trades for 25 years, according to the book's biographical note. In these exact and substantial poems, he deftly manages to do full justice to the too-often-overlooked world of work while wisely resisting the temptation to romanticize his craft. In ''Laborer's Code,'' a workman ''rips a bag of chips, / pops a Coke'' before returning to work ''for the pleasure of shoving the shovel in.'' In ''Sledgehammer's Song,'' Turpin deploys strings of monosyllables to achieve a staccato energy that evokes the music of demolition: ''The way a stance is spread, / The way the steel head pings / and thrums and thuds, / The way it undoes what was done.'' But readers of this collection need not worry about enduring giddy paeans to manual labor. Turpin sees with a clear eye the frustrated ambitions, complex human relationships and weary resignation that can be found at most any workplace. In ''Waiting for Lumber,'' Turpin asks: ''What was work in our lives anyway? / No one recalled a moment of saying yes / to hammer and saw, or anything else.'' Turpin's language is refreshingly plain, and his deadeye accuracy gets to the heart of our conflicted relationship with work. Andrew Santella",2003-07-06T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Ergas has served as a Trustee of the International Spinal Research Trust, London, and as a Director of the American Paralysis Association. In 1980 founded Therapeutic Technologies, which developed the Ergys electrical stimulation bicycle that allows paraplegics and quadraplegics to exercise aerobically. His interests also included real estate. In 1983 he began work on Deco Plaza, the first redevelopment project following the establishment of the Art Deco National Historic District. It received the Miami Beach Development Corporation Award as the Best Rehab of 1985. The son of Jack and Grace Ergas of Cedarhurst, NY, Mr. Ergas moved with his family to Bal Harbour in 1968 and entered the University of Miami. He received his BBA in 1972 and his JD from the U of M Law School in 1974. He remained a member of the Florida Bar and resident of Dade County throughout his life. Marty was admired most for his charm, his wit, his intellect, his love of the moment, and for his unfaltering sense of possibilities. He was loved by his family and friends as an extraordinary listener who offered straightforward advice with warmth and wisdom. He loved challenges: he learned to sail in the San Francisco Bay and fly fish in Colorado; he played tennis and completed the Orange Bowl Marathon in his wheelchair. Mr. Ergas maintained an active interest in the history of the Sephardic Jews and in that of his own family who had lived in the former Ottoman Empire for more than four centuries. He maintained relationships with family and friends in Western Europe, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Australia, Chile and Canada. He spoke Ladino (the old Spanish) and French, his conversations seasoned with Turkish phrases learned from his father. He is survived by his wife Shaari Ergas of Coconut Grove, stepchildren Jamie Hallman of Los Angeles and Justin Hallman of San Francisco, mother Grace Ergas of Bal Harbour, sister Betti Zucker of NYC, and a large extended family. Donations in his memory to the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Coral Gables will be directed to the development of wheelchair accessible transportation to tour the gardens.

Briggs Swift Cunningham II, who was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lived the majority of his life in Westport, Connecticut, died in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 2, 2003. Mr. Cunningham was the son of a Cincinnati financier and businessman who funded the start-up of Proctor & Gamble. While attending Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, Briggs developed a love of yacht-racing, which lead him to international recognition when he skippered the Columbia to victory in the 1958 America's Cup yacht race. In the 1930s Mr. Cunningham and two friends formed the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) to promote racing in the New York area. In 1940 he began designing and building his own cars. After World War II, Briggs founded the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and competed in his first race at Watkins Glen, New York driving his ''BuMerc''-a hybrid Buick/Mercedes of his own creation. In 1950 Mr. Cunningham began his quest to win the 24 Hours of LeMans race in France. To legitimize the image of American racers, Briggs decided to build his own car; an Americanmade sports car that would be competitive with the best that Europe had to offer. He was the first American to drive an American car in the 24 Hours of LeMans. Teaming first with Cadillac and then with Chrysler and their new ''hemi'' engine, Briggs designed and built the Cunningham car. From the first C-1 to the most successful C4R, the Cunningham cars were marvels of American design and engineering. Briggs Cunningham gained the respect of racers worldwide and created a style of car which served as an inspiration for the Corvettes and Vipers of today. Over the next twenty years, Mr. Cunningham continued to design and build innovative race cars. Through strategic alliances with Jaguar, Maserati and Roger Penske, Briggs continued to enter cars in races worldwide including the 24 Hours of LeMans, the U.S. Grand Prix at Watkins Glen and the Presidents Cup at Virginia International Raceway. Mr. Cunningham was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1997 and into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame this past April. Mr. Cunningham is survived by his former wife, Lucie Bedford Warren, of Westport, Connecticut and their three children, Briggs Swift Cunningham III of Lancaster, Kentucky, Lucie Cunningham McKinney of Westport, Connecticut, and Cythlen Maddock of Palm Beach, Florida, and 16 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.

As Congress and the White House assess the future of the nation's space program, they must start with the need to refashion NASA, whose reputation for engineering excellence and dedication to safety is in tatters.

The theater was greatly blessed by Andrew's extraordinary spirit, his profound understanding of the way cultural institutions work in New York City. Andrew reveled in the artistic life of the theater. He was endlessly curious about the plays, their provenance and was eager to understand the process by which a script was converted to a production. He was given to saying that having read a play, he couldn't quite imagine it on stage, and was most often delighted by the realization of a production. Andrew's commitment, generosity, kindness and challenging intellect will be sorely missed along with his wise and gently commanding presence.

The New York Public Library deeply mourns the passing of its Chairman Emeritus, great leader, champion, benefactor, and guardian, Andrew Heiskell. With great wisdom, and with selfless dedication and devotion for more than two decades, he was the guiding spirit in the Library's resurgence from financial difficulties in the 1970's and helped move the Library into a new century, embodying his vision as a university of the people without equal. Under Mr. Heiskell's leadership, the Library raised over $300 million in the 1980's, and he was directly and instrumentally responsible for securing financial support from diverse public and private sources, in addition to his own generous philanthropy. His great achievements included the restoration of the landmark Library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to its original grandeur, the upgrading of many of the Branch Libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island; improved access to the Library's great research collections; and the revival of the preservation program. He helped expand the Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and strengthen the endowment for The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. His interest in the Library's immediate surroundings led him to form the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, responsible for a comprehensive renovation of the Park, and he helped build 44 miles of new storage for the research collections in underground book stacks beneath the Park. The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, a facility dedicated to serving the blind, visually impaired, and others unable to read standard print material, is named in his honor to recognize his great energy and commitment in making this facility a reality. New York is a better place because of Andrew Heiskell, for his creation of beautiful public spaces, his drive to provide democratic access to knowledge, and his unwavering support of cultural institutions and their role in bettering society. We owe him our deepest, most profound thanks, and we are grateful to have been touched by a man of such extraordinary vision and goodness. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marian Heiskell and to all members of Andrew's family. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Samuel C.

From January to May, industrial production increased 0.6 percent, while for the 12-month period ended in May, the figure rose 2.7 percent. Eager to combat inflation, the government raised rates to a four-year high of 26.5 percent earlier this year.

Under Mr. Heiskell's leadership, the Library raised over $300 million in the 1980's, and he was directly and instrumentally responsible for securing financial support from diverse public and private sources, in addition to his own generous philanthropy. His great achievements included the restoration of the landmark Library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to its original grandeur, the upgrading of many of the Branch Libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island; improved access to the Library's great research collections; and the revival of the preservation program. He helped expand the Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and strengthen the endowment for The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. His interest in the Library's immediate surroundings led him to form the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, responsible for a comprehensive renovation of the Park, and he helped build 44 miles of new storage for the research collections in underground book stacks beneath the Park. The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, a facility dedicated to serving the blind, visually impaired, and others unable to read standard print material, is named in his honor to recognize his great energy and commitment in making this facility a reality. New York is a better place because of Andrew Heiskell, for his creation of beautiful public spaces, his drive to provide democratic access to knowledge, and his unwavering support of cultural institutions and their role in bettering society. We owe him our deepest, most profound thanks, and we are grateful to have been touched by a man of such extraordinary vision and goodness. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marian Heiskell and to all members of Andrew's family. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Samuel C. Butler, Chairman Elizabeth Rohatyn, Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeriti Paul LeClerc, President",2003-07-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HEISKELL, , ANDREW","HEISKELL -- Andrew. The New York Public Library deeply mourns the passing of its Chairman Emeritus, great leader, champion, benefactor, and guardian, Andrew Heiskell. With great wisdom, and with selfless dedication and devotion for more than two decades, he was the guiding spirit in the Library's resurgence from financial difficulties in the 1970's and helped move the Library into a new century, embodying his vision as a university of the people without equal. Under Mr. Heiskell's leadership, the Library raised over $300 million in the 1980's, and he was directly and instrumentally responsible for securing financial support from diverse public and private sources, in addition to his own generous philanthropy. His great achievements included the restoration of the landmark Library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to its original grandeur, the upgrading of many of the Branch Libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island; improved access to the Library's great research collections; and the revival of the preservation program. He helped expand the Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and strengthen the endowment for The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. His interest in the Library's immediate surroundings led him to form the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, responsible for a comprehensive renovation of the Park, and he helped build 44 miles of new storage for the research collections in underground book stacks beneath the Park. The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, a facility dedicated to serving the blind, visually impaired, and others unable to read standard print material, is named in his honor to recognize his great energy and commitment in making this facility a reality. New York is a better place because of Andrew Heiskell, for his creation of beautiful public spaces, his drive to provide democratic access to knowledge, and his unwavering support of cultural institutions and their role in bettering society. We owe him our deepest, most profound thanks, and we are grateful to have been touched by a man of such extraordinary vision and goodness. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marian Heiskell and to all members of Andrew's family. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Samuel C.

Shinhan's president, Choi Young Hwi, said the acquisition of Chohung would enable Shinhan to reach customers through a wider network, but Shinhan, in a concession to union members who fought the deal, will operate Chohung as a separate bank for at least three years.

A founding member of the New York City Speech-Language-Hearing Association, a charter member of the New York State Speech - Language Hearing Association and a member of the American Association of Audiology, Markwitz was a certified member of the American Speech-language-Hearing Association. When the New York State Department of Education established licensure status for her profession Markwitz was appointed as a member of the first licensure board. She was among the first of her profession in New York State to establish an independent practice. Early on in her career she directed her practice toward the development of verbal language among hearing - impaired children. With the strong belief that a universal ''inborn language mechanism'' operates normally only when children are given exposure to an adequate sample of language at an early age, Markwitz practiced what she described as a developmental psycho - lin guistic approach to language acquisition for hearing-impaired children. With this approach, her children have developed to live productive and often professional lives, fluent in verbal language. She shared this approach with colleagues in numerous presentations as well as with students at New York University, where she taught. She will be sorely missed.

us,"36 Hours | Cape May, N.J.","AS soon as summer heralds its presence, tourists descend upon this Victorian resort at New Jersey's southern tip. The town, with a permanent population of 4,200, plays host to a half-million visitors annually -- most of them during the summer. An outdoorsy mentality has thrived on this 3.5-square-mile island (a canal makes it an island) for quite some time -- ever since the Kechemeche Indians hunted and fished here. In 1620, Cornelius Jacobsen Mey, a Dutch explorer, navigated the coastline and gave his name to the area, though the spelling was later changed to May. Breeze-seeking Philadelphians eventually made Cape May one of the nation's first seaside resorts. Today, entrance to Cape May's two miles of public beaches requires adults to pay as they go ($4 per day, $8 for three days), in the form of beach tags, which are sold around town. While the fee may be a nuisance, it helps to ensure immaculate beaches. And although Victoriana is a major attraction in Cape May, you can also stumble upon rolling farmland, thick woods and semideserted dunes, just as past explorers did generations ago.

The acceptance ends a 10-week standoff after Neverfail rejected Coca-Cola Amatil's initial bid of 2.35 Australian dollars a share ($1.55) as too low. The reversal comes amid concern that small shareholders would be bought out at a lower price when Amatil, based in Sydney, acquired the remaining shares.

The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and the Members of its International Council mourn the loss of their beloved and gentle colleague and friend, Dorothy Miller who, together with Alfred H. Barr, Jr., the Museum's founding Director, built the Museum's collection and exhibition program during its formative years. Throughout Dorothy's 35 years as a brilliant museum curator, she organized many landmark exhibitions, which recognized undiscovered talented American artists. These pioneering shows contributed greatly in building public awareness of the rich and diverse work by major artists who first emerged in the middle of the 20th Century. Although she retired from the Museum in 1969, as Curator of Museum Collections, her exuberant love of art and inspiring influence on the younger staff remain as part of her legacy. A longterm member of the Museum's International Council and Honorary Trustee of the Museum, Dorothy was first and foremost a passionate advocate for artists. We extend our deepest sympathy to her nephew, Reid White, her niece, Mrs. Edith White Danton, and her step-daughter, Jane Cahill Blumenfeld.

In Plausible Portraits OF JAMES LORD: With Commentary by the Model (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25), he pairs these pictures with short, reflective essays in which he explores the dynamic between himself and each artist and offers his perspectives on portraiture and aesthetic truth. Sentimental, humorous, occasionally sardonic, the narratives give an intimate and refreshing glimpse of figures like the poet (and draftsman) Jean Cocteau and the bristly photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. Lord uses anecdotes to sustain his interpretations of the artworks, examining with meticulous grace how each portrait's vitality hinges on the relation between artist and model. He imbues this dynamic with metaphysical and redemptive qualities, claiming portraiture offers humans a ''gamble against death.'' Through their flexibility and creative license, the 37 likenesses reveal with stunning clarity how the variables of mimesis diverge with each artist's interpretation of a constant model. Some are roughly executed and others tender; some appear vital and others inert. Giacometti's determined, sculptural vision emerges as a clear contrast to Picasso's swift genius. As Lord writes, ''In the image he creates the artist dwells.'' Roxana M. Popescu",2003-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Chinese Underground,"According to the Chinese government's official statistics (which, critics say, are conservative estimates), 6,121 people died last year in coal mines in China. With numbing regularity, year after year, Chinese miners are killed by floods, fires, gas explosions, collapsing tunnels and carbon-monoxide poisoning. Most miners are migrants who hail from the country's poorer regions, endangering their lives to make more money than they would by farming the land. They are 117 times more likely to be killed at work than their American counterparts.Putting human faces on this statistical horror is Song Chao, a 24-year-old amateur photographer who also happens to be a miner in Shandong Province. About two years ago, Song met Hei Ming, a professional photographer from Beijing who helped him develop a hobby of taking pictures of his co-workers. Song began with a 35-millimeter camera, but when Hei showed him the work of the American photographer Richard Avedon, he became determined to switch to a 4-by-5-inch camera of the sort that Avedon uses. Though the camera was prohibitively expensive, with financial support from friends and family he was ultimately able to acquire one. His portraits, which are being featured this month at the International Photography Encounter in Arles, France, and in September at the Pingyao International Photography Festival in China, are uncannily reminiscent of Avedon's, yet unique in their intimate acquaintance with their subjects.",2003-07-13T05:00:00+0000

A field of tall grass and wildflowers sloped down from the porch, and hundreds of fireflies blinked on and off in the middle distance, so that the line where our earthly, mortal light yielded to the celestial became beautifully blurred in the darkness. As I stood at the rail, I could hear the uniquely peaceful sound of untroubled sleep behind me in the cabin- my wife and two children. I scanned the dark sky for a shooting star.

His personality, his videos, his guest appearances and his forthcoming mock-heavy-metal side project, Probot, all bear this out, but nothing does so more than the new Foo Fighters ''DVD/EP'' (RCA), which contains several videos by the band, including one for ''Low.'' Shot like a home movie, it features Mr. Grohl and the actor, comedian and singer Jack Black checking into a motel room. Inside, they goof off, destroy the room and maul each other to comic effect before dressing up as women and passing out together.

Throughout Dorothy's 35 years as a brilliant museum curator, she organized many landmark exhibitions, which recognized undiscovered talented American artists. These pioneering shows contributed greatly in building public awareness of the rich and diverse work by major artists who first emerged in the middle of the 20th Century.

us,World Business Briefing | Asia: Hong Kong: Better Rating Sought,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that it had hired HSBC and Goldman Sachs for advice on how to improve its credit ratings. With a large budget deficit amplified by the costs of the SARS outbreak, Hong Kong is quickly going through fiscal reserves accumulated from budget surpluses in the 1990's, and it may have to start issuing foreign-currency debt. Standard & Poor's has assigned a rating of AA- to Hong Kong's local-currency sovereign debt, which is mainly used in interbank operations. It assigned a rating of A+ for the autonomous Chinese territory's foreign-currency debt, even though such debt is not being issued. S.& P. also has a negative outlook for Hong Kong's local-currency debt and a stable outlook for foreign-currency debt. The hiring of the investment banks was first reported earlier this week by Apple Daily, a local newspaper, and confirmed on Wednesday by the monetary authority.

In a decision made public yesterday, the panel ruled that Peter Melzer, a teacher at the Bronx High School of Science for more than 30 years, was justifiably dismissed by the Board of Education in 2000. Parents threatened to withdraw their children from school after Mr. Melzer's membership in Nambla -- which advocates sexual relations between men and adolescents -- was reported by a local television station, WNBC. The panel said Mr. Melzer's right to free association was constitutionally protected but the disruption of his membership was ''great enough to warrant the school's action.'' Mr. Melzer's lawyer, Eugene Nathanson, called the decision ''dangerous'' to government employees. Stacy Albin (NYT)",2003-07-18T05:00:00+0000

People with coronary heart disease have higher levels of the enzyme in their system; thus, elevated concentrations can serve as early warning signs. This is the most common form of heart disease, which causes more than 500,000 deaths annually. The test, called PLAC, is made by diaDexus of San Francisco. Jos Ramrez (NYT)",2003-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Every now and then, the television industry answers such criticism with a sitcom about members of an ethnic group or subculture who are just like you and me, though cuter and more colorful. Occasionally, the show becomes a hit. The national audience encounters new cultural styles; the minority enjoys the pleasure of mass representation; everyone glows with the feeling that prejudice has been overcome.

Like its better-known siblings ''Six Feet Under'' and ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Wire'' has been praised for its intelligent writing, nearly flawless ensemble acting and distinctive visual style. By now we expect as much, and the superiority of the cable channel's original programs to just about everything else on television -- and to most theatrically released movies -- is hardly news. What's great about ''The Wire,'' though, is how difficult it is. The stories are hard to follow; the cases have a nagging habit of remaining unsolved; the characters endure endless frustration, betrayal and mismanagement.

Mr. Joneleit's main concerns are timbre, texture and space, and he uses them inventively and with an almost visual sense of placement. Structure comes into his sound pictures as well, but in a way so quirkily personal that organizational signposts are hard to discern. Other musical building blocks -- themes, for example -- hardly figure in his processes at all, although now and then a melodic fragment teases the ear. At a time when new music is chasing accessibility, Mr. Joneleit's pieces recall the avant-garde sound sculptures of the 1960's.",2003-07-20T05:00:00+0000

And the girls relished details of other fights: Two maiden aunts had had a brick wall built down the center of their Victorian house in Dorchester, the better to avoid each other; back in County Cork, one Crossley and his widowed sister hadn't spoken for the last twenty years of their lives, although they slept in the same cottage and sat across the kitchen table from each other three times a day.

Perhaps it wasn't so surprising. Japanese culture had become obsessed with the relationship between life and art. There was an increasing belief that the two should never be separated, that a well-lived life was a work of art. Was it surprising that some Japanese poets wanted to try to weave the two together, to make a little tatami of life and art? What better time than at the moment of death?

us,"How's Your Mom, Oed?","In her first book, a collection of short stories titled THE WINTER WITHOUT MILK (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12), Jane Avrich skillfully and subtly manipulates such forms as the morality tale, the monologue and the spoof to show us characters grappling with tense social and psychological situations. In ''Life in Dearth,'' a girl who lives in a seaside village likes to indulge in ''borrowing'' miscellaneous things from Gypsies who live by the shore; as her borrowing continues, she becomes more indebted, ultimately finding her life inexorably changed. The persistent protagonist of ''The Census Taker'' finds his life's validity tested upon encountering a woman who refuses to cough up any information. Although Avrich can be wickedly clever -- as in ''Chez Oedipus,'' a catty tour of the house of the incestuous royal patricide, or ''Lady Macbeth, Prickly Pear Queen,'' a reimagining of the Scottish queen as a 20-century high-strung society gal -- she never loses sight of one of her signal themes, the tension between individual liberty and the forces working against it. The best news here is that Avrich's sentences are acute and piercing, giving these 15 stories both a striking delicacy and a confidence that is impossible to ignore.

Settles Suit Against Youth In Net Fraud,"The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that it had settled a lawsuit against a 17-year-old California boy who used unsolicited e-mail messages and a fraudulent America Online Web page to gain access to credit card information and steal thousands of dollars from consumers. The boy, who was not identified because he is a minor, will be required to pay $3,500 in consumer repayment, officials said. Timothy J. Muris, the chairman of the F.T.C., said the case was the first focused on an Internet scheme called phishing, in which spam e-mail messages are used to lure computer users to look-alike or counterfeit Web sites, where they are then encouraged to supply personal financial data. Officials said the teenager created a fraudulent AOL Web site, which included the company's logo and links to legitimate AOL Web pages, seeking credit card numbers, billing addresses, Social Security numbers and AOL screen names and passwords. ''Phishing is a two-time scam,'' Mr. Muris said. ''Phishers first steal a company's identity and then use it to victimize consumers by stealing their credit identities.''",2003-07-22T05:00:00+0000

The company, which makes printers for Dell Inc., was expected to earn 80 cents in Thomson Financial's survey of analysts. Lexmark's estimate is lower because the company has decided to seek more sales of money-losing printers in order to increase demand for its ink cartridges, which yield a continuing revenue stream, the chief financial officer, Gary Morin, said in an interview.

Pataki yesterday signed into law a bill requiring stiffer sentences for teenagers convicted of murder after being tried as adults. The governor said, ''When you are 14 or 15 and commit a murder, you know what you are doing.'' Under the old law, a judge could sentence a juvenile murderer tried as an adult to a maximum of nine years to life, making him eligible for parole after nine years. The new statute raises that maximum to 15 years to life. It applies only to people 14 or 15 who a judge has decided should stand trial as adults. The minimum sentence for such defendants also went up as the governor signed the bill, to 7 1/2 years to life from 5 years to life. James C. McKinley Jr. (NYT)",2003-07-23T05:00:00+0000

The Recording Industry of America has filed almost 1,000 subpoenas in Federal District Court in Washington, requesting information from educational institutions and Internet service providers on users of KaZaa, the file-sharing service. The group issued the requests as part of its effort to crack down on those using the Internet to illegally distribute copyrighted music. Both colleges said they were opposing the subpoenas on procedural grounds, rather than contesting the association's right to the information. ''In this case we have been advised by counsel that the subpoena was not in compliance with the court rules that apply to these subpoenas, and did not allow M.I.T. time to send any notice as the law requires,'' said James D.

The village of Saranac Lake sits in the heart of the spectacular Adirondack Park, which, at six million acres, is bigger than Yosemite, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon combined. Unlike neighboring Lake Placid, Saranac Lake has resisted becoming a bustling -- or gentrified -- tourist town. Residents and visitors can be found hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing, kayaking and hunting, when they are not admiring the majestic surrounding mountains, known as the High Peaks, or the crystal-clear lakes framed by dense forests. Although the village of Saranac Lake is close to the three Saranac Lakes (Upper, Middle and Lower), it actually sits on the shores of Lake Flower, a smaller lake ringed by Victorian houses. Saranac Lake became known in the early 1900's as a leading tuberculosis treatment center after Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau established a sanitarium on a sweeping stretch of lakefront property. Some of the original ''cure'' cottages still remain, as does the Trudeau Institute, now an infectious disease research center. Saranac Lake's small-town spirit shines at events throughout the summer, including the Adirondack Festival of American Music (through July 31), the Can-Am Rugby Tournament (Aug. 2 and 3) and the Adirondack Canoe Classic (Sept. 5 to 7).

Manufacturing output is estimated as unchanged from a quarter before, while consumer spending, reflected in the 0.4 percent increase in the service industries from the previous quarter, continues to grow. ''There is a real gap between the consumer, who is still feeling fine and having a party in his garden, and the business sector,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist with the Bank of America in London.

us,Island Clearly Shows Its Own Economic Identity,"''Lobbying to Keep Economic Identity'' [July 20], about the federal Office of Management and Budget's decision to downgrade Long Island's status as a metropolitan area, reminded me of the Monty Python routine about the Minister of the Silly Walk. It portrays a citizen applying for a silly walk award and the government official proceeds to demonstrate his own silly walks as far superior and more worthy. Similarly, you have the federal Office of Management and Budget denying Long Island's status as an economically independent, separate metropolitan area. In the many years I have traveled between New York City and the Hamptons, I have been struck by the continuing development of Suffolk County and the eastern parts of Nassau. We have come a long way since 1947 and the development of Levittown. The notion that Long Island is a division of New York City is illogical. The strength of the outward movement and the resulting economic activity invalidates the budget office's downgrade. Clearly the federal officials may have a better silly walk, but it shouldn't blind them to the reality that Long Island has forged a separate economic identity. Perhaps Billy Joel can produce a sequel to ''New York State of Mind'' and designate Long Island as a separate mental state. I know I feel different when I'm on the East End. If you use the traffic as a barometer, I think the notion of an economically independent Long Island is self-evident.",2003-07-27T05:00:00+0000

Republicans said the trip was unseemly at best, as the union contributed to Mr. McGreevey's campaign, and complaints grew when the union president told delegates that he expected the organization to face federal racketeering charges. After giving his speech on Tuesday, Mr. McGreevey cut short the five-day trip and returned to New Jersey -- not because of the criticism, his aides said, but to speak at the funeral of a friend's daughter who died on Sunday.

An ancient crone grins ghoulishly over a bowl of food; a demonic figure whispers in the ear of a stooped old man; a midnight coven surrounds a goat-headed sorcerer; a dog raises its head forlornly; and, most famous of all, a raggedy-bearded man with bulging eyes devours a human form that is already reduced to red meat.

''He was very patriotic,'' said his wife of 68 years, Wilma Lerner. He was drafted into the service in 1943, leaving behind his wife and newborn daughter Judith. He served in the 29th Division of the 116th infantry, E. Company. ''I had no fright at all,'' Charles Lerner said in a 1998 interview with a local paper. ''We were a patriotic family. If I had to go, I had to go, and I was going to do the best job I could.'' Among the medals and badges Lerner earned for his service was the Purple Heart. While firing from the top of a tank, a shell exploded, leaving shrapnel embedded in his back. The blast took the life of a good friend positioned next to him. He was discharged just after Thanksgiving in 1945. Lerner was born in Brooklyn, NY., and attended Columbia University. He moved to Coral Gables and worked as a pressman. He returned to New York continuing his career at The New York Times from 1962-1978 and later retired to Cooper City about 20 years ago. Lerner was a member of the Veterans of foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans. In addition to his wife Wilma, Lerner is survived by a daughter Judith Lerner of Long Island and a grandson. A son, Tice Lerner, died in 1988. A memorial service will be held in Long Island in the future. Boyd's Family Funeral Homes, University Drive Chapel handled arrangements.

But when the estate is that of a recently deceased Hollywood star, a sale can become an event in itself. At least 100 people stood in line before dawn on July 18 at the Glen Ridge home of Eddie Bracken, a longtime stage, screen and television actor who died in November and whose credits included the Preston Sturges comedies ''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' and ''Hail the Conquering Hero.'' Hundreds more walked through the airy Victorian home, which had been sold separately, before the sale closed the next afternoon. They took away porch furniture, paintings and golf clubs as well as photographs, sheet music, librettos, playbills and screenplays, most of which went for $1 or $2. An autobiography of Sturges, signed to Bracken by Sturges's wife, and marked at $40, was unsold by mid-afternoon, as was a box lot of Bracken's jokes, marked at $50. Jim Mahon, a neighbor, bought some scripts of ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Another neighbor, Cherry Provost, bought a silver-plated stamp holder with the initials of Bracken and his wife. Trolling through dead people's possessions can feel macabre, but picking up a picture of Bracken frolicking in his bathing suit with Ronald Reagan inspired other thoughts. A star had lived, prospered and died. His neighbors had two days to gather what fairy dust remained, and they made a merry time of it.

But several months earlier, he tore his rotator cuff while pounding a surveying stake, and the injury required surgery. He had been off work for about eight weeks, attending physical therapy sessions and catching up on odd jobs around the house. Now Long was eager to get back to work -- back to the routines of ordinary life, which he had been struggling to recapture ever since the events of last summer when, for a brief, hallucinatory moment, he was a hero.",2003-07-27T05:00:00+0000

Extravagant by nature, notorious for parading around Europe with his trademark monocle, cane and fur coat accessorized by a pair of ''chrysanthemum-colored gloves,'' he cultivated dandyism in part to market himself as a painter of ''the fashionables,'' as a friend called Whistler's clientele. WHISTLER, WOMEN, & FASHION (Frick Collection/Yale University, $50) is an engrossing study of the artist's obsession with clothes, a passion that, as Margaret F. MacDonald, Susan Grace Galassi and Aileen Ribeiro reveal, was anything but superficial. Painted portraits became an increasingly popular way to immortalize status; an entertaining chapter on the history of fashion quotes a novelist who wrote in 1878, ''There is now a class who dress after pictures and when they buy a gown ask 'will it paint?' '' Whistler took these matters into his own hands, styling all his sitters. In the case of Frances Leland, with whom he was rumored to be in love, he actually designed the diaphanous tea gown in which he depicted her (she had wanted something traditional and black) to signal both his modernity and his informal rapport with his subject. Lady Meux, who did not start out a lady but married the heir to a vast brewery fortune, whom she met at a tavern or dance hall, commissioned several portraits by Whistler as part of her campaign to upgrade her position. Portraying her in an excess of white fur, diamonds and makeup, Whistler not only glorified her finery but cleverly cast her, in more ways than one, as a painted lady. Hilarie M.

Honeysuckle and roses, barely tamed, clamber over the front door of the rambling 1906 stucco house that she and her husband, Carter F. Bales, have here. They found the house 25 years ago on a winding road on Centre Island, a peninsula reached by causeway from Bayville, where it crooks like an elbow around Oyster Bay Harbor.
