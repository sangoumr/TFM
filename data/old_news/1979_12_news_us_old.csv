To each of these assignments, Mr. Davis brought a multitude of gifts. He was sensitive to the most involved structural demands; he had an extraordinary ear for nuances of texture and coloring; he ranged easily from abstract idioms to solemn mainstream swinging, and he edited himself as he went along, so that both his solos and accompaniments were concise, gracefully deliberate, and packed with provocative, intelligently ordered ideas.",1979-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Robert et Robert,' Claude Lelouch Comedy:The Cast","Wearing the expression of a dog who expects to be kicked at any minute, Robert Villiers (Jacques Villeret) looks as unhappy as he actually is most of the time. He is overweight, forever second-guessed by a pushy mother, and so unsure of himself that he apologizes for the noise when he turns the page of a magazine in a waiting room. You know that he'd never go out of the house if his shoes squeaked.Robert is a student policeman but the chances are slim that he'll ever make the grade as a Paris gendarme. His way of dealing with a traffic accident is not that of the gendarmerie. Instead of officiating at the scene with the proper biliousness, Robert flees, often close to tears.Robert Goldman (Charles Denner) is no better adjusted, though he attempts to mask his unworthiness by being impossibly arrogant. This Robert is a taxi driver, as was his late father, much to his mother's long-lived disappointment. But Robert Goldman takes taxi-driving seriously. He prides himself on his knowledge of Paris and on giving his passengers service de luxe, including their choice of tea or coffee during the journey.Neither Robert is obvious marriage material, so it's probably natural that they should meet in the waiting room of a matrimonial agency, one that guarantees its customers satisfaction with the aid of a computer that is able to match a man who likes hot chocolate with a woman who likes hot chocolate. When Robert Goldman objects that he doesn't want a woman who's exactly like him, the head of the agency, Mr. Millet (Jean-Claude Brialy), says sagely, ""Remember, your wife would be your best friend if she were a man,"" which stumps Robert for a moment.Claude Lelouch's ""Robert et Robert,"" which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse, is the diverting, very funny tale of the growing friendship of Robert Villiers and Robert Goldman, two of the world's least predatory misfits, and of how they break through to social success in ways they could never have expected. Like all Lelouch comedies, ""Robert et Robert"" is infinitely generous, both in spirit and to its characters, but, unlike many earlier Lelouch films, it is not more generous than we in the audience want it to be.""Robert et Robert"" has the great good fortune to have two exceptionally fine actors in the title roles. Mr. Denner, who has been a star in French films for years (""Landru,"" ""The Bride Wore Black,"" ""The Two of Us,"" ""The Man Who Loved Women,"" etc.), is an old friend, and the sham hauteur he displays here is not too different from the self-satisfaction he exhibited as the obsessed rat-catcher in Franois Truffaut's ""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me.""Mr. Villeret will be a discovery for American audiences, though he has had small roles in such earlier Lelouch films as ""And Now My Love"" and ""Another Man, Another Chance."" For reasons I don't quite understand, he reminds me of a very young, portly Peter Lorre, perhaps because behind that facade of quiet desperation there are hints of the existence of an intellect that is far from passive and innocent. However Mr. Villeret works on the consciousness, his performance is exceedingly comic and appealing without ever slopping over into the sort of lazy sentimentality that sometimes mars Mr. Lelouch's films.The excellent supporting cast is headed by Mr. Brialy, who's in the process of making a most graceful transition from star roles to character parts, and Regine, the singer and nightclub hostess, who plays Mr. Villeret's acid-tongued mother, a woman who finds sexual satisfaction through the same agency that fails her son.""Robert et Robert"" is not entirely free of Mr. Lelouch's tendency to hoke up things that would be more effective if played-straight. There's also no reason at all that both of the leading characters should be named Robert, except that someone thought it would be a cute title. Yet these sugary affectations and sunny mannerisms, which have often made Mr. Lelouch's films look like commercials in search of name-brand products, never succeed in distorting the comic, no-nonsense decency of Robert and Robert. They are good company.",1979-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Koko,' Tale of a Talking Gorilla:Fascinating Insights","WE'VE all heard tell of that special, indefinable quality that makes a movie star, that makes one face more captivating to the camera than a thousand others might be. Well, Koko the gorilla has one of those fabulous faces. Koko is the subject of a feature-length documentary by Barbet Schroeder, handsomely photographed by Nestor Almendros, but she didn't earn her star's status on glamour alone. Only 7 years old, and with a life expectancy of 50 years, she has already mastered 300 words of the sign language used by the deaf. She can also eat hamburgers, identify vegetables, ask to be tickled and clean up her room.Mr. Schroeder's ""Koko, A Talking Gorilla,"" which has its American debut today at the Public Theater, concentrates on the relationship between Koko and Penny Patterson, the developmental-psychology student who is either Koko's trainer or her mother, depending on your point of view. They have spent five years together, years in which Miss Patterson has not taken vacations. And they are so close that Miss Patterson, who lives in a house, must be sure to be around Koko, who lives in her own trailer, at Koko's bed-time and when she wakes up in the morning.The film watches them quarrel, and study, and just plain horse around, letting Koko's remarkable talents reveal themselves during the course of many different episodes. At the beginning of the film it may seem strange so see Koko sitting beside Penny in a car, in traffic, in a suburb near Stanford University. By the end, you may wonder why Koko isn't driving.Mr. Schroeder makes a point of approaching both his subjects, Penny and Koko, as a foreigner. So a good deal of time is devoted to the very American habits of pretty, blond Penny, and her manner of passing them on to the gorilla. Peanut butter and the aformentioned hamburgers have become staples of Koko's diet, a narrator remarks, and an astonishing sequence shows Penny trying to teach Koko to put on mascara. (At this, Koko puts one of her four feet down.) Koko reads from standard storybooks, and prefers her red sweater to her yellow one. She has already been taught such words as ""good,"" ""bad,"" ""polite"" and ""steal."" As the narrator inquires, ""Will Koko become the first White American Protestant gorilla?""Miss Patterson herself raises the question of whether Koko ought to have the legal rights of an American child  her I.Q., after all, is only slightly below normal for a human being of the same age. The film also discusses, in its concluding section, the question of whether humans have exclusive rights to the status of persons, and how much more reluctant they might be to despoil nature if they considered themselves at one with their environment rather than superior to it. ""Koko raises all the important questions about man,"" the narrator maintains.Whether or not that is so, Koko does present some fascinating insights into matters of behavior and education. And Mr. Schroeder has assembled this funny, provocative documentary with gratifying intelligence and care.",1979-12-04T05:00:00+0000

He had a passion for color, which he expressed in his work via large, saturated chromatic fields separated by gently drawn black lines in the simplest of rectangular compositions, the better to focus on the subtle relationships of tone to tone. The works have a calm, even meditative presence, but beneath their meticulously brushed surfaces lurks a joyous lyricism, held back by a fastidious control.

us,Screen: 'Aces High' and Berri's 'Papa':Airborne 'Journey's End',"""ACES HIGH"" and ""Le Cinema de Papa,"" two films that make up the latest bill in the Thalia's series of previously unreleased features, would otherwise inhabit the movie equivalent of never-never-land. Neither is lively enough to have won the attention of general audiences. On the other hand, neither is polished or audacious or exotic enough to have enjoyed an art-house run. It's easy to see why neither film warranted an American engagement before now.And yet the Thalia's series, by highlighting works such as these, makes an unexpected virtue of their mediocrity. By presenting movies that lack the wherewithal for either critical or commercial success, the series becomes an occasion for thinking about qualities most movie audiences take for granted. There's nothing particularly wrong with either ""Aces High"" or ""Le Cinema de Papa""  but there's nothing really right with them either. Unlike some of the better unreleased features the Thalia has shown, such as last week's ""Dirty Money,"" these aren't films of eccentric energy. They're formula efforts in which the formula never quite gets off the ground, and it can be instructive to wonder what's missing.""Aces High,"" directed by Jack Gold, is a 1976 version of the World War I play ""Journey's End"" that has been given an all-star cast and an airborne setting. The characters are now pilots, and their biplane battles are perhaps the film's most ambitious feature. But the real action is on the ground, or at least it ought to be, as the young British officers of the drama try to steel themselves for war. Drinking and smoking and womanizing and barroom songs about heroism are all part of the process by which they ready themselves.Although ""Journey's End"" comes to a notoriously weepy ending, this movie version courts disaster by making it impossible to shed a tear. The final moments are so perfunctory that the film feels truncated. And for all its good actors and interesting performances  the cast includes Simon Ward, Malcolm McDowell, Peter Firth, along with Christopher Plummer, Ray Milland and John Gielgud  the film has a subdued feeling and no central thread.The aging boyishness of the three tow-headed principals sets an eerie mood at times; those scenes involving Mr. McDowell, Mr. Ward and Mr. Firth together are the movie's best, although Mr. Plummer also does a fine Job. But there are no real changes in the characters except for those brought on by attrition, and after a while the combat footage becomes the movie's only source of momentum. Still, ""Aces High"" is nothing worse than a well-cast, well-mounted war movie without any particular spark. At its worst, it is merely listless; ""Le Cinema De Papa,"" on the other hand, is actively disagreeable much of the time.Claude Berri, who wrote and directed this 1970 autobiographical film, clearly subscribes to the Gallic maxim that one's own boyhood, faithfully recreated on the screen, can be a source of infinite charm. However, Mr. Berri has come up with a singularly charmless variation on this formula, although he has been more successful with other autobiographical efforts (""The Two of Us,"" ""Marry Me, Marry Me""). This time, concentrating on his relationship with his late father and the early stages of his own movie career, Mr. Berri fills the movie with self-serving anecdotes about his own triumphs, and plays himself with an unappetizing mixture of complacency and false navet. The actor who plays Mr. Berri as a 16-year-old is just as grating, only smaller.",1979-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Human Prey Menaced in 'Killer Fish':The Plastic Skeleton,"How can I describe ""Killer Fish,"" the new Carlo PontiFilmar do Brasil production from I.T.C. Entertainment, released by Associated Film Distribution, and presented by Sir Lew Grade? As a celebration of cinema? No. As a celebration of civilized ideas? Not really. Is it a film that demonstrates the brutality and tenderness of words? Quite possibly, though the only line I'm sure I remember accurately is when the beautiful Margaux Hemingway, in her first (and possibly last) film role since her memorable performance in ""Lipstick,"" points to a vehicle in the sky and, putting herself right on the line, announces, ""It's an airplane.""You might not realize it but this is a triumphant moment. Thinking does not come easily to Miss Hemingway, the actress. Nor, for that matter, does closing her mouthher full, sensual upper lip has a way of getting hung up, like a theater curtain, on her upper front teeth.""Killer Fish"" might be most accurately described as a searing melodrama. It strips away the flesh of man to reveal, not the soul, but the plastic skeleton. I hesitate to tell you the movie's plot for fear you might think it's silly, but duty requires it.The film opens with a long sequence in which Karen Black, Lee Majors and three other men, all dressed in what appear to be wet suits, blow up a huge power plant that turns out to be in Brazil. But It's not really a power plant, per se. It's the power plant for an emerald mine, and the people dressed in wet suits blow up the plant to divert the attention of the guards responsible for a safe containing a veritable fortune in gems.The robbers make a successful getaway and bury the gems in a waterproof box at the bottom of a reservoir stocked with man-eating piranha fish, though they don't know that at the time. Later we meet James Franciscus, who plays the gang's mastermind and the fellow who stocked the reservoir with the piranha. Almost immediately we also meet Miss Hemingway, who plays a beautiful model; Marissa Berenson, who plays her boss; Roy Brocksmith, her photographer, and the other members of a group that's come to Brazil to shoot a fashion layout.Before Miss Hemingway can say, ""It's an airplane,"" the members of the movie's cast meet one another at the fashionable resort hotel where they're staying, and they pair off in various ways while we wait for people to have their skeletons bared when they fall into the reservoir, which happens with some frequency.""Killer Fish,"" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, also has one hurricane, one tornado, one dam collapse, one plane crash, one boat going aground and one life raft that sinks. Even so, it looks less like a conventional movie than like the photographic record of a movie company's trip to Brazil.It may not be a good movie  it's really ineptbut it's friendly, like Mr. Majors's quizzical squint, which is, I'm told by people who watch more televison than I do, what Mr. Majors does best. Everyone, in fact, carries on gamely, as people do at a picnic when it rains. Miss Berenson, who looks more and more like Ann Dvorak with very thin eyebrows, maintains a kind of resolute availability, always ready to talk to someone who feels low or lonely. Miss Black makes the mistake of attempting to act, and thus comes across as the party-bore, the person who attempts to steer conversation to important topics when everyone else is interested in gossip.""Killer Fish"" was directed by Anthony M. Dawson, an Italian film maker whose real name is Antonio Margheriti.""Killer Fish"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains many scenes in which people are attacked by piranha fish that look like angry guppies.",1979-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Star Trek,' Based on TV:The Cast","""Star Trek,"" the popular television series that died 10 years ago but would not be forgotten, has, like Lazarus, come back to haunt the skeptical and reassure all those who have kept the faith. It's called ""Star Trek  the Motion Picture,"" rather superfluously, I think, because I doubt anyone who sees it could possibly confuse this film with those shards of an earlier, simpler, cheaper television era.Watching ""Star Trek  the Motion Picture,"" which opens today at Loews Orpheum and other theaters, is like attending your high-school class's 10th reunion at Caesar's Palace. Most of the faces are familiar, but the dcor has little relationship to anything you've ever seen before. Among the friends are good old Captain Kirk (William Shatner), commanding officer of the Starship Enterprise; pointy-eared Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), whose humanity disqualifies him from attaining ""kolinahr,"" the state of grace on his native planet Vulcan; Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), the spaceship's general practitioner, nicknamed ""Bones,"" just as he might have been on H.M.S. Bounty, and such other reliables as Scotty (James Doohan), the engineering officer, and Sulu (George Takei), the ship's helmsman.The newcomers are Stephen Collins, who plays Commander Decker, the Enterprise's stalwart young executive officer, and Perris Khambatta, an actress from India who plays Ilia, a shockingly beautiful young woman whose head has been shaved as clean as a whistle in the fashion of her home-planet, Delta Four.This time out the mission of the Enterprise is to intercept a mysterious cloud, which is apparently light years in diameter and is heading toward earth for reasons that not even Mr. Spock can divine. It's not revealing a secret to tell you that the cloud contains what is usually referred to under such circumstances as ""a superior intelligence,"" though just what that intelligence is must remain one of the film's few witty surprises.I suspect that wit is not what ""Star Trek"" fans are looking for. Instead they want to see favorite characters who are as ageless and multidimensional as characters in a comic strip, and not at all ashamed of those origins. The dialogue  at least what dialogue one can hear over Jerry Goldsmith's music and the sounds of rockets being fired  is of a banality that soothes the weary mind, like Magic Fingers that work on a tired brain. Unlike ""Star Wars,"" which was full of conscious associations to other literature, ""Star Trek"" refers only to itself, with the possible exception of the climactic sequence that borrows freely from Christian myth.The film's vision of the future, which is a bit tacky at the beginning, becomes increasingly hypnotic as the movie goes on, or maybe it just seems that way as one falls under the spell of so many abstract patterns of light and color, designed to simulate the experiences of the members of the Enterprise crew as they pass through various dimensions of time and space.""Star Trek"" is yet another film that owes more to Douglas Trumbull and John Dykstra, who did the special photographic effects, and to Harold Michelson, the production designer, than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer, Gene Roddenberry, who also created and produced the television series.The formidable Robert Wise, who once directed a good, pacifist sci-fi film, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951), a film with very few special effects, directed ""Star Trek,"" but I can't imagine what there was for him to do after telling the actors where to stand. Because most of the drama in such a movie is created in the laboratories, the actors are limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief.",1979-12-08T05:00:00+0000

The other image alludes to the special nature of Bournonville's art. It was the glimpse of a little blonde girl in a folk costume held up stage by a parent in Bournonville's The King's Volunteers on Amager.

us,A Harrowing Film About Ireland Today:A Harrowing Film on Ireland,"A naked prisoner sits strapped to a wooden chair in a basement interrogation room, while his questioner prods him with electric shocks. When he still refuses to talk, another questioner coolly breaks his fingers with the edge of a brown plastic tray, then disgustedly leaves him lying unconscious on the concrete floor.This 10-minute torture scene is part of a harsh new motion picture called ""The Outsider,"" which just opened here, shocking British audiences by deeply disturbing this country's image of itself. The directorial debut of Tony Luraschi, a 40-year-old American, the film is a stunningly accurate portrayal of the violence in Northern Ireland. And the British are so dismayed by its view of the troubled province because, as the critic Tom Hutchinson wrote in Now magazine, ""the gloating inquisitor who is applying the electric pain and smashed fingers is on our side.""In a way that often recalls how Americans used to feel about the Vietnam war when it was still in progress, the British do not like to talk or even think about what they call ""the troubles"" in Northern Ireland. During the past decade, two thousand people have been killed in the battle that the Roman Catholic republicans are waging to drive the British off the island. But the deaths rarely rate more than a couple of paragraphs anymore in the newspapers.""The Outsider"" is the story behind those short articles  ""I.R.A. Gunmen Kill Magistrate,"" ""Protestant Gang Kills Catholic Legislator,"" ""Troops Kill 12-year-old Terrorist."" But unlike those little newspaper items, the film is impossible to ignore, which is why one magazine article described it as ""merciless,"" and why Alexander Walker, a critic for The Evening Standard, called it ""an addition to the debate on Ulster that uses the unrivaled power of cinema to involve us in the uneasy morality of civil war.""Like ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" Mr. Walker wrote, ""The Outsider"" is able to ""bring an unpopular war home to people through the medium of popular entertainment, with an artistic skill that can sharpen perceptions and not blunt them, as the ever-repeated news of I.R.A. violence does on TV or in the press.""Before its London premiere (the movie will open in the United States early next year), British officials and Army officers, concerned that the film might glorify the terrorist cause, asked for a special preview  and, to the irritation of Mr. Luraschi, they were given one. But they needn't have worried. Virtually no one in the ""The Outsider"" emerges with any glory, and the terrorists are no more sympathetically portrayed than the British ""occupiers.""The film tells the story of Michael Flaherty (Craig Wasson), a young American who has grown up enchanted by the tales that his grandfather (Sterling Hayden) tells of his glorious exploits as a fighter in the Irish Republican Army. Fired by the idealism of the battle against ""the Brits,"" Michael (the ""outsider"" of the title) leaves his comfortable home in suburban Detroit and goes to Ireland to help the I.R.A.Soon after he joins their ranks, however, the I.R.A. leaders in Dublin, always worried about the flow of contributions from the United States, decide that he can best help the cause by getting killed in battle, and they plan how to bring about his death. The equally devious British Army command also tries for a propaganda gain by planting the idea that Michael is a spy, so that the I.R.A. will kill him in one of its ritual executions.British audiences are shocked by the sight of Army officers plotting murder in an office that is serenely surveyed by a wall photograph of Queen Elizabeth. But the film is equally unsparing about the fuzzy green haze of Irish romanticism that blinds so many republicans, who even today are killing in the name of nationalism. In Michael's childhood, his grandfather had lulled him to sleep with ballads about the brave fighters who ""loved dear old Ireland and never feared danger."" The old man had constantly reminded him of the revolutionary dictum that ""in every generation must Ireland's blood be shed."" But after he gets to the scene of the battle as an adult, Michael learns that, up close, most of those sentiments are as elusive as the morning mist that hangs over Ireland's rolling green countryside, and they are often far less noble than they first seemed.""My film just declares the facts of the situation,"" explained Mr. Luraschi, who directed the film from his own screenplay, shooting most of it in the Repulic of Ireland, with the permission of the Irish Government. ""It doesn't have a point of view. It just tells what is happening.""London reviewers gave the film mixed, though generally favorable, reviews. Several of them distinguished between its merits as a work of art and its political significance. Nigel Andrews, for example, writing in The Financial Times, found some artistic flaws, especially in the climax of the picture. But he hailed ""The Outsider"" as ""a substantial breakthrough, nonetheless, in tackling the Irish question."" Mr. Andrews continued: ""Luraschi shows a scrupulous lack of favoritism in his attribution of idealism and cynicism to either side. He also captures the slow-burn horror of a war conducted by sabotage and ambush rather than open confrontation on the battlefield."" Writing in The Daily Mail, Margaret Hinxman said the film ""will inevitably cause a furor"" and added, ""One can only be ashamed at the timidity of the commercial British film industry in refusing to touch this hot potato.""Surprisingly, Mr. Luraschi had never set foot in Ireland before 1976, when he first read ""The Heritage of Michael Flaherty,"" a novel, then unpublished, by an American journalist named Colin Leinster. Although he had had a good deal of experience in film making  as an assistant director under Roger Vadim, Ruy Guerra and Alberto Lattuada, among others  he had never directed a full-length feature.""I wanted to do something about terrorism, and I realized that Colin's book was it,"" Mr. Luraschi explained in a recent interview in his two-room apartment on the Left Bank in Paris. ""So I took an option on the book, and then set out to learn about the Irish problem.""Moving with his wife into a white stone farm cottage in County Cork, not far from the sea, Mr. Luraschi, an alumnus of North Hollywood High School and the California Institute of Fine Arts, spent six months writing his screenplay and talking to people on both sides of the 300-mile border separating the Republic from the British province. Finally, he sold the idea to Paramount Pictures, of which his father, Luigi Luraschi, is a vice president.Like other Americans who have come to study the Irish problem, Mr. Luraschi was shocked at what he called ""the British blindness"" about Ireland. ""To them, the Irish are stupid, lazy, the subject of jokes,"" the director said, his intense brown eyes opening wide in indignation. ""But that's all. They don't want to admit what is really happening, or what is being done in their name.""One of the most pernicious figures in ""The Outsider"" is Nigel Percival (David Collings), a young major in British Army intelligence, stationed in Belfast. It is he who conceives the idea of setting up Michael as a spy and who acquiesces in the torture of another republican sympathizer by the Northern Irish police.The sight of Nigel, huddled in a furtrimmed overcoat and watching the man being beaten and maimed because he will not talk, is all the more shocking because the young officer's appearance and manner  vaguely reminiscent of, say, Alec Guinness in ""The Bridge On the River Kwai""  have stood in so many films for the right-mindedness of British authority and such traditional British virtues as decency, civility and honor. As Mr. Luraschi says, the scene makes it ""harder for us to wash our hands of it than if it had been of Arabs torturing each other, or a Nazi concentration camp.""The way in which this young major with his upper-class English accent has been brutalized by his duty in Northern Ireland is as true as a real incident there last February: a 20-year-old British soldier on guard duty in a particularly hazardous part of Belfast suddenly went berserk and began firing indiscriminately, killing one fellow trooper and wounding another, before a fourth soldier shot him dead.And it reflects one of the aspects of the problem that most trouble the thoughtful people of Northern Ireland  the way violence and its threat have become routine, brutalizing everyone. Shoppers entering a supermarket in Belfast no longer even notice, or interrupt their chatting, when they are frisked for guns and their purses are searched for bombs. Out in the green countryside, no one (except the occasional sniper) pays any attention anymore to the four-man army patrols, in camouflage battle fatigues with automatic rifles, who pick their way carefully through the most charming and picturesque villages, with the last man walking backwards to cover the rear, as if in a hostile jungle.But the soldiers suffer from it. The father of the young man who went mad on guard duty last winter said that the four months' service in Northern Ireland had ""finished"" his son. And he added, echoing the sentiments of Mr. Luraschi, ""perhaps this tragedy will make someone in England realize that this can't go on and on and on.""Anyone familiar with Northern Ireland is struck by the way the fiction of ""The Outsider"" constantly overlaps with reality. Fund-raising in America really is one of the I.R.A.'s main concerns; whatever one may think of the film as a work of art or entertainment, it is a fact that the ambushes in the film are as real as the attack that killed Earl Mountbatten last August. And, ironically, the real climate of violence and sectarian recrimination portrayed in the film will make any theater owner in Belfast wary of showing it, for fear that one group or the other will set off a bomb. The film also depicts the little routine horrors of daily life in Belfast: the small boys in an alleyway, earnestly comparing bomb-making techniques at an age when they should be talking of football or cricket; the sweet little grandmother, with a gold cross around her neck, who puts down her cup of tea at the sound of trouble and rushes to the door, calling out to the friendly neighborhood terrorists as they run by, ""Get one of the bastards for me. Kill the bastards. God bless you lads.""""The Outsider"" leaves the viewer with a conclusion that many visitors to the troubled island have already drawn: that the agonizingly complex Irish problem will not yield to simple solutions, neither the loyalists' demand for more police presence and more police powers, nor the republicans' facile cry, ""Brits out."" The film presents all the complexities in a troubling and ambiguous episode about a 12-year-old boy who is shot dead as he tries to throw a homemade fire bomb into a building that had been the bunker of loyalist snipers.His death in the film would be far simpler emotionally if he were killed by accident. But he is not. He is, in fact, acting like a terrorist, although the soldier who shoots him, peering dimly through the familiar Irish mist, has no idea that his target is so young. (""Jesus Christ, it's a kid,"" the soldier says in anguish, when he sees the corpse up close.)A terrorist, yes. But still a 12-year-old boy who at first doubts that he can even come along with his older friends on the bombing attack, because ""my ma won't let me out after dark."" So he sneaks out to play with the big boys, and a few hours later is lying face down, dead, in the wet mud of a back alley in Belfast.",1979-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,BRITAINMENT'S ESTABLISH SPIES,"On May 25, 1951, at the height of the cold war, two British diplomats, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, disappeared from Great Britain just as they were about to be apprehended as spies for the Soviet Union. The defection of these members of the establishment stunned the nation. It also shattered what Andrew Boyle, in The Fourth Man, describes as the traditional publicschool convention of mutual trust obtaining between colleagues who shared the same privileged social backgrounds. ... That a Communist conspiracy could have so atrophied the normal impulses of patriotism that men in positions of responsibility would betray their country's secrets to the Soviet Union out of conviction seemed quite incredible. Alas, an official conspiracy of silence set in. Shock, embarrassment, grievance, bewilderment, these and other negative responses to inconceivably bad news were fortified by the ageold instinct of the British ruling class to sit tight and say nothing when in doubt and difficulty. The stiffupperlip technique irritated the general public and was derided by the press.

us,Film: California Goes To War in '1941':Pearl Harbor Plus 6,"THE year: 1941. The month and the day: Dec. 13. The hour: dawn. A young woman appears on a misty, lonely beach in northern California. Identified by the logo on the back of her robe as a member of the Polar Bears Club, she runs merrily, innocently, toward the water, shedding her robe as she goes and plunging into the icy waters. The music becomes ominous. The young woman frollicks with abandon as . . . as . . . but I'm not allowed to tell you any more except that this is not only the opening sequence of Steven Spielberg's elephantine new period comedy, ""1941,"" but also the best gag in the picture.The film, which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is an attempt to bend history in a comic way to recall what happened after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor when a lone enemy submarine appeared off our West Coast and ineffectively lobbed a couple of shells into an oil field (transformed into an amusement park in the movie).In the vision put together by Mr. Spielberg and the screenwriters (Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, with the help of John Milius, who worked with them on the story), it's something of a wonder that, in the panic that accompanied the attack, California did not disappear under a six-foot blanket of custard-pie fillings, marshmallow frostings, splattered eggs, paint, chicken feathers and the other decontrolled substances that are the ordnance of slapstick comedy.To find a movie to compare with ""1941,"" one has to go all the way back to 1963 and Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" which, like ""1941,"" was made by a director who has no special knack for being funny. Yet Mr. Kramer did have the sense to hire the very talented William Rose to write the screenplay and some of the world's greatest living comedians to star in the picture.Though they can't give coherence and over-all style to ""1941,"" which documents, hour by hour, the day and the night that California almost died of fright, there are some extremely comic actors at work in this enterprise. Had the film succeeded, it would have been the last critical word on Darryl F. Zanuck's lugubrious mock-documentary about Pearl Harbor, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" though ""1941"" is far more spectacular.Among the pleasures of the film are John Belushi, who lurches in and out of the action as a monomaniacal National Guard pilot, certain that there's a secret Japanese airfield ""somewhere in the clover fields around Pomona""; Dan Aykroyd, as a gung-ho tank sergeant who delivers a very funny peroration on the meaning of Americanism (a speech that is not all that different from some of the things being said these days in connection with the crisis in Iran); the ever-reliable Warren Oates, who plays a certifiably crazy fellow named Mad Man Maddox; Robert Stack, who plays the real-life Gen. Joseph (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell, later the hero of the Burma Road, but who, at the outbreak of the war, was stationed in California and, according to the movie, spent most of that night of infamy watching ""Dumbo"" at a downtown Los Angeles theater.There are lots of other talented people, including Treat Williams (""Hair""), Toshiro Mifune, Ned Beatty, Christopher Lee, Penny Marshall, Slim Pickens and Wendie Jo Sperber, most of whom are on and off so quickly you tend to forget they're there. Patti Lu-Pone, who plays the title role in Broadway's ""Evita,"" is prominently listed in the cast but doesn't seem to open her mouth here.The huge, profligate scale on which Mr. Spielberg (""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") has constructed ""1941"" works against the intended hilarity. There are too many characters who aren't immediately comic. There are too many simultaneous actions that necessitate a lot of cross-cutting, and cross-cutting between unrelated anecdotes can kill a laugh faster than a yawn.Everything is too big. We don't laugh at a gigantic riot of servicemen in and around the Los Angeles United Service Organization Club. We are stunned by what appears to be the thousands of extras  enough to fill a Yugoslavian-made biblical epic. The sight is dumb-founding. When, in an old two-reeler, Laurel and Hardy set out to repair the roof of Stanley's house and, instead, reduce it to kindling wood, we are reduced to tears of laughter because, among other things, the scale is small. The house looks like a glorified tool shed. It is not real life but a representation of it, as is all slapstick comedy. In ""1941,"" when a full-size, two-story house falls over a cliff, we groan at the effort.It may possibly be that Mr. Spielberg has chosen gigantic size and unlimited quantity as his comedy method in the awareness that he has no gift whatsoever for small-scale comic conceits. The slapstick gags, obviously choreographed with extreme care, do not build to boffs; they simply go on too long. I'm not sure if it's the fault of the director or of the editor, but I've seldom seen a comedy more ineptly timed.""1941"" is less comic than cumbersome, as much fun as a 40-pound wrist-watch.""1941,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some vulgar language and gestures.",1979-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Opera: Puccini's Rondineat Juilliard The Cast,"If any Puccini opera can be said to have the sugared eroticism of Massenet, it is La Rondine. It had its premiere in 1917, and it looks back to La Boheme and Tosca as well as ahead to the chinoiserie of Turandot. But it never really has held the stage, thanks to an inferior plot that almost seems stolen from La Traviata and Die Fledermaus, and also thanks to music that some listeners find disagreeably sweet. That said, the Juilliard American Opera Center revived La Rondine on Wednesday night, and it was a pleasant experience. Yes, the music is sentimental. It started as an operetta, commissioned by a Viennese theater, and it is full of waltzes and pretty tunes. But harmonically it is more sophisticated than most operetta; the vocal parts are more difficult; and the melodies, they seldom rise to Puccini at his best (though there is a smashing quartet), contain the essence of the Puccini style. Thus one wonders why the opera has been so neglected.",1979-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Two Vehicles For Mastroianni at Thalia:An Innocent in Chicago,"THE extraordinary gifts of Marcello Mastroianni, who has resolutely refused to leave Europe to become a Hollywood star, are the principal subject of the double-bill opening today at the Thalia Theater  Ettore Scola's ""My Name Is Rocco Papaleo"" (1971) and Elio Petri's ""Todo Modo"" (1976). Both films, which are being commercially released here for the first time, demonstrate not only Mr. Mastroianni's mastery of his craft but also the vast differences that sometimes exist between the popular European cinema and our own.""My Name Is Rocco Papaleo,"" which appears to have been shot entirely in Chicago (and is being shown here in a dubbed English-language version), is the sort of grim political fable that European audiences accept more readily than we do. It's about Rocco Papaleo (Mr. Mastroianni), a nave Italian immigrant who comes to Chicago from Canada to see a prize fight and, in the course of one mishap after another, becomes politicized.Rocco is nave but he has the tourist guide's instinct for finding the colorful locale. As Rocco wanders from one side of Chicago to the other, from the Gold Coast to Skid Row and back, he is taken up by a beautiful, neurotic model (Lauren Hutton) and assorted bums, pimps and whores. He is ridiculed, patronized, seduced, philosophized to and robbed, finally becoming a not-so-passive observer of most of modern society's ills.""My Name Is Rocco"" is probably too schematic for American tastes, but once one accepts its style, it is an often fascinating tale of a contemporary pilgrim. Mr. Scola (""A Special Day"") is relentless in the way he records the squalid, the ugly and the cruel, though the point of view of the camera is, essentially, that of its humane hero. Because Mr. Mastroianni is a sophisticated actor, we are aware at first that he must play down to Rocco. After we are in the film, however, it's the intelligence of the actor that illuminates the performance.Mr. Petri's ""Todo Modo"" (taken from St. Ignatius of Loyola's quote, ""All means are good to find the divine will"") is conceptualized film making that is almost totally unknown in this country. It's a surreal fable about power, politics and religion in contemporary Italy. The setting is a luxurious, modishly decorated underground religious retreat where Italy's ruling elite  then the Christian Democrats  have repaired to participate in various spiritual exercises designed to make them worthy of ruling in God's name.Shortly after its original release in Italy, ""Todo Modo"" was banned, reportedly according to some Italian newspapers, for being a threat to the re-election of Aldo Moro, who was later kidnapped and assassinated by terrorists.The movie is not easy to follow for someone not privvy to the Italian social and political scene. I assume it is full of inside jokes and references that go over my head. I also tend to resist movies in which we are told of terrible events off-screen, which are never actually explained, and in which one principal character is identified only as ""Him,"" though everyone else has a proper name.It's not difficult to understand, though, that Mr. Petri is convinced that the Christian Democrats, the church and capitalistic society are all rotten to the core. The movie consists of a series of confrontations between the head of the retreat, a world-weary priest played by Mr. Mastroianni, and members of the establishment who have come to the retreat for guidance (and, instead, are murdered one by one).Chief among the politicians is the president, a supposedly pious, modest man consumed by ambition and guilt, a role beautifully played by Gian Maria Volonte. Mr. Mastroianni's performance is limited only by the material, since this is a movie in which political attitudes and positions are more important than character.",1979-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Widower's Tale In Simon's 'Chapter Two':Second Time Around,"THE two lovers in Neil Simon's ""Chapter Two"" have what one of them sardonically calls ""a fortune-cookie romance,"" trading pithy wisecracks and epigrammatic pillow talk. He, George Schneider (James Caan), is a well-heeled writer mourning the death of his first wife when he meets Jennie Mac-Laine (Marsha Mason), an actress who is destined to become his second. Their love affair is a whirlwind courtship with a gentle, lazy pace, which is one of many reasons why the film version feels self-contradictory, or at least incomplete. Fortunately, Miss Mason gives a vibrant, appealing performance that minimizes the movie's troubles and encourages the audience to sit back and enjoy the scenery.George begins the story in a wounded daze, and Mr. Caan acts the injured party convincingly. He rattles around a house filled with memories of his late wife, goes on a preposterous blind date, and listens miserably to the pep talks of his pushy brother Leo (Joseph Bologna). Then he meets Jennie, and they begin to trade smart remarks, with Mr. Caan struggling noticeably to keep up his end of the conversation. He appears much more comfortable with the dolorous aspects of the story than he does with banter.But Jennie blooms so unmistakably during the course of the romance that George's troubles are hardly evident after a while. Robert Moore's direction works so hard to minimize George's importance, In fact, that the last part of the film seems given over to shots of Mr. Caan's attentive back, as he listens to Miss Mason's soliloquies.Mr. Simon's screenplay shifts the emphasis from George, who was the center of his semi-autobiographical play, to Jennie. Perhaps this is why the movie's George never feels like a full character, why his grief isn't real or his rebirth surprising. Although much of the story is set in George's house, which is full of what ought to be revealing artifacts, not much sense of him emerges. His nature, which is supposed to be alternately loving and resentful, isn't well-enough delineated to give the ending of the film much urgency.His status as a famous writer remains similarly ill-defined. Indeed, George's sense of his place in the world, relative to both women and success, is strangely absent in the story; ""Chapter Two"" could well have benefited from the kind of unobtrusive acknowledgement of celebrity that turns up in ""10.""There are too few subsidiary characters, too few establishing details, for the story to concentrate so closely on love without becoming artificially narrow.Miss Mason, who has been acting more confidently and looking prettier with each successive movie, is this time every bit as sunny and intelligently appealing as Mr. Simon's screenplay means her to be; the material rests the weight of the movie upon her shoulders, and she carries it ably. The story doesn't move much, and neither, consequently, does Miss Mason's character. So there are no great depths to the performance, but there's a lot of fire. This is especially evident in Miss Mason's scenes with Valerie Harper, who plays her best friend and looks horrifyingly thin, especially in comparison to the radiant, healthy air of Miss Mason.""Chapter Two"" now incorporates a horse, a tropic isle and Zabar's in the interests of opening up the play. It also involves a fair amount of treacle, especially when the lovers are sweet-talking one another or making a series of cute phone calls. Marvin Hamlisch's score is in much the same vein.""Chapter Two"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes occasional strong language and one discreet bedroom interlude.",1979-12-14T05:00:00+0000

""Fill 'er up, uh . . . Mrs. Nussbaum?"" asks Steve Martin, thus demonstrating his suitability for the title role in ""The Jerk."" But in the course of playing a happy idiot, Mr. Martin proves himself  often hilariouslyto be nobody's fool.""The Jerk,"" which opens today at the Gemini I and other theaters, is by turns funny, vulgar and backhandedly clever, never more so than when it aspires to absolute stupidity. And Mr. Martin, who began his career with an arrow stuck through his head, has since developed a real genius for playing dumb. This time, he's gone way beyond the silly tricks of those early days  notwithstanding the scene that shows him toddling despondently with his pants at his ankles, wearing a bathrobe and carrying a ping-pong paddle and a chair. This time, the emphasis is on comic sophistication, as when he sends back a vintage bottle in a fancy restaurant, crying to the waiter ""Let's splurgebring us some fresh wine!""The initial joke, which like many of the gags in ""The Jerk"" is reworked so many times it eventually wears thin, makes Mr. Martin the abnormal son of a black sharecropping family  the only child, for instance, for whom tuna, Tab and Twinkies constitute a favorite meal. Finally, on his birthday  about his 35th, it appears  his parents inform him that he is not their natural child. Stunned by this news, he decides to hit the road.The funniest gags in ""The Jerk"" are the ones that capitalize on sentimental movie traditions, dopey to begin with and made even dopier here. Deciding to leave home, Mr. Martin stands outside his family's shack for hours until a truck comes by. ""How far you goin'?"" the driver shouts. ""St. Louis  how far you goin'"" Mr. Martin inquires. ""To the end of this fence!"" is the answer, and Mr. Martin hops in, with a merry cry of ""O.K.!"" Several seconds later, the journey is over, and Mr. Martin is thanking the driver for his company. Mr. Martin plays this with a marvelously asinine optimism, and a ridiculous overabundance of good cheer.As directed by Carl Reiner, ""The Jerk"" is comfortably slapdash; unlike ""Oh, God!,"" which Mr. Reiner also directed, it doesn't seem strained. The laughs aren't steady, but they're persistent, and the film moves fast enough to compensate for its unevenness. Even when it's crude  which is quite a lot of the time  it's not mean-spirited. In comedy this broad, that's half the battle.Mr. Martin and his co-star, Bernadette Peters, work very sweetly together, even when they sing a duet of ""Tonight You Belong to Me,"" carrying sweetness to what could easily have become an intolerable extreme. Miss Peters is all pouts and dimples as the nice girl Mr. Martin marries, the wife for whom he builds a dream house featuring ""an all-red billiard room with a giant stuffed camel."" Her obligatory counterpart, the predatory female of the piece, is played by Catlin Adams, riding a motorcycle and wearing black leather. Mr. Reiner appears in the movie, in a cameo role that makes use of his ready ability to cross his eyes. Jackie Mason plays Mr. Martin's employer at the gas station, in a sequence that ends with the abduction of a small, white church by a blue Chevrolet.",1979-12-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 4 Dances by the Bolshoi Ballet at the Beacon:The Program,"Three new Soviet dance films and one old one, each with the Bolshoi Ballet, go on view today and tomorrow at the Beacon Theater, Broadway and West 74th Street.For those who don't care to sit through eight hours straight of screenings  separate tickets are required for each show  some preferences might be in order. There is only one clinker in the lot, and that is ""Ivan the Terrible"" (1977). By contrast, ""Spartacus"" (1975), with magnificent performances by Vladimir Vassiliev and Maris Liepa is not to be missed. ""Romeo and Juliet,"" a rerun of the famed 1954 film version of Leonid Lavrovsky's ballet with the great Galina Ulanova is hors concours as a classic and deserves to be seen on those grounds alone.That leaves ""Anna Karenina"" (1974), the only Bolshoi production in this series never seen live on an American stage. It is very openly a vehicle for Maya Plisetskaya, the Bolshoi's prima ballerina, and any opportunity to see her flick an eyelash is a privilege. The choreography is credited to Miss Plisetskaya  at the 1972 premiere, Natalia Ryzhenko and Viktor Smirnov were called assistant choreographers  and it is not difficult to arrive at the conclusion that Miss Plisetskaya is a greater dancer than a choreographer. Aleksandr Godunov is the passionate Vronsky to Miss Plisetskaya's Anna.With a dramatic score by Rodion Schedrin, this ""Anna Karenina"" as both ballet and film falls far short of its subject. The tone is more Pierre Cardin than Tolstoy, and Mr. Cardin did, in fact, design the pretty chiffon bustles that Miss Plisetskaya wears from scene to scene. Certainly it is more of a film with ballet than a filmed ballet. Shots of real snow, real buildings and a real train are crosscut with stage sets while the camerawork is strongly stylized.Miss Plisetskaya's sympathies are clearly with the adulterous heroine rather than with the disapproving milieu around her. Yuri Vladimirov as the stationmaster of the novel is nonetheless made to act as Anna's symbolic conscience, and there is a clear attempt at psychological interpretation in such scenes as the pas de trois of Anna, Vronsky and Karenin, portrayed by Vladimir Tikhonov.In its theme of Anna versus society, however, this is a pretty schematic rendering of a great novel. Divided mainly into ensembles and duets, it gives Miss Plisetskaya and Mr. Godunov some fine melodramatic movements, but the choreography is conventional. The celebrated scene at the races comes off best. In bit parts, Nina Sorokina is seen as Kitty and Mariana Sedova as Betsy.Yuri Grigorovich's ""Spartacus"" already familiar to American audiences, comes into its own here as both ballet and film. The inherent cinematic approach in Mr. Grigorovich's staging of Aram Khatchaturian's score falls perfectly in place. The soliloquies become closeups, and no back curtain is needed for what were the simulated dissolves on stage. Vladimir Vassiliev, as the slave who leads an unsuccessful revolt against the Romans, dances and acts on a heroic level that is the performance of lifetime. Maris Liepa matches him on every point magnificently as the villain, the Roman general Crassus. Natalia Bessmertnova and Nina Timofeyeva round out the ballet's great original cast. With its phalanxes confronting the camera head-on and its slow-motion shots of Mr. Vassiliev soaring through the sky, the film takes its chances. It is also one of the best dance films ever made.Unfortunately, the camera has ruined any strong dramatic points made in Mr. Grigorovich's ""Ivan the Terrible."" Some of the best choreography, such as the battle with the Mongol invaders, is lost in a blur of multiple exposure. We are left with Yuri Vladimirov's impressively crazed facial expressions and the support given him by Miss Bessmertnova and Boris Akimov. The closeups however, recall Sergei Eisenstein's own film of ""Ivan the Terrible,"" and not to this version's advantage.Screening times for both days are ""Romeo and Juliet,"" at 3 P.M., ""Ivan the Terrible"" at 5, ""Spartacus"" at 7 and ""Anna Karenina"" at 9.",1979-12-15T05:00:00+0000

My own conviction is that the musicalcomedy buff and the man who hurries all the way to Brooklyn to see what Peter Handke's been up to are, really, one and the same person. In each instance, he's taking care of his preferences first. If he is a theatergoer, though, he does limit his horizons arbitrarily. His apetite grows. The patron who's been to Annie, and been pleased by Annie, will very probably be lured into The Elephant Man before he's through, and I can well remember seeing an avowed disciple of Brecht sneaking into a performance of No, No, Nanette.

us,Screen: 'Kramer vs. Kramer':East Side Story,"THERE may be no place in the world that seems quite as civilized and reassuring as Manhattan's East Side  when you're feeling good and have money in your pocket. It's expensive but value is given. It's a privilege simply to look into the windows of Madison Avenue boutiques that keep their doors bolted against customers who don't measure up. The sidewalk musicians on Fifth Avenue play Purcell and Vivaldi and one never has to travel very far to find a restaurant where the food is worth the king's ransom it costs. Unlike those on the West Side, most of the apartment building doormen on the East Side wear uniforms that differentiate them from the muggers. Everything seems forever.When things are going wrong, though, Manhattan's East Side immediately reflects the unhappiness of an upwardly mobile people who have no idea where they're going or why. Everything is ridiculously expensive. Walls are thin and ceilings low. Cab drivers are rude. Husbands are self-centered and unreliable and wives, who have been urged to realize themselves, start by seeing an analyst. As rats command the sewers, vaguely understood fears run amok through the corridors of the fancy new high-rises above.This is the hermetic world of Robert Benton's fine, witty, moving, most intelligent adaptation of Avery Corman's best-selling novel, ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" which opens today at Loews Tower East and other theaters.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a Manhattan movie, yet it seems to speak for an entire generation of middle-class Americans who came to maturity in the late 60's and early 70's, sophisticated in superficial ways but still expecting the fulfillment of promises made in the more pious Eisenhower era.Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is a self-described take-over guy who left Brooklyn for Manhattan's East Side and is speeding to the top at his advertising agency. Everything in his life is working out as planned. When ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" opens, the elated Ted has just been handed his agency's most valued new account. As he says a few minutes later, this has been one of the five best days of his life.It is with some surprise, then, that he returns home to find his wife, Joanna (Meryl Streep), jaw-set and teary-eyed, determined to depart forever, leaving Ted not only with an entire ad presentation to prepare for the next day but also with their six-year-old son, Billy (Justin Henry), to take care of. Ted is not someone who always gets his priorities straight.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is one of those rare American movies that never have to talk importantly and self-consciously to let you know that it has to do with many more things than are explicitly stated. It's about fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and most particularly, perhaps, about the failed expectations of a certain breed of woman in this day and age.Though much of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is occupied with the growing relationship between the abandoned father and son, through tantrums and reconciliations and playground accidents, the central figure is that of the movingly, almost dangerously muddled mother, played by Miss Streep in what is one of the major performances of the year. Joanna is not an easily appealing character, especially when she returns after 18 months of therapy in California and seeks legal custody of the child she walked out on.Though beautiful, intelligent, well-educated and no more than casually self-assertive at the start, she grows into one of those fiercely determined people who talks about ""finding"" herself even as we  and she  suspect there may be nothing to find except another series of compromises. She seems to be a woman in transit to disappointment. Maybe not. She's not a character who can be conveniently categorized, and she is fascinating.Mr. Hoffman is splendid in one of the two or three best roles of his career. It's a delicately witty performance, funny and full of feeling that never slops over into the banal, which is the greatest danger faced by an actor who must play most of his scenes with a small boy who is as down-to-earth and pragmatic as Justin Henry. There is no way that Mr. Hoffman can avoid being upstaged when Billy, watching his father make a mess of French toast, says carefully. ""I don't like it folded.""""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is densely packed with such beautifully observed detail. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff and George Coe.The man responsible for the photography is the gifted Nestor Almendros, whose earlier credits include Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven,"" Franois Truffaut's ""The Story of Adele H."" and Eric Rohmer's ""Clair's Knee,"" among other things. The Manhattan he shows us is familiar enough but we see a lot more than a series of pretty surfaces.""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language and some discreet nudity.",1979-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Seeking 'Solutions':Scientific Odyssey,"THE Search for Solutions,"" which opens today at Cinema 2, is not the sort of film you would expect to find playing in Bloomingdale country. Only two theatrical engagements are scheduled, in New York and in Los Angeles. It will be shown on public television next spring and be distributed to schools and colleges.The stated purpose of ""The Search for Solutions"" is to stimulate interest in science and technology, primarily among the young. The film comprises nine 18-minute sections touching on various aspects of scientific inquiry that its makers say can be shown as a whole, as it is in this engagement, or in any combination of its parts.Each of the sections bears a portentous title and touches on eight to 14 illustrative subjects. The first section, for example, is called ""Context,"" and deals with such diverse matters as the use of an upright airplane wing instead of a sail on a boat, the ""singing"" of humpback whales, the ancient clay tokens that are thought to represent the earliest known use of human language, the discovery of the X-ray, the invention of a canvas tube that is safer and quicker than a ladder or a rope for descending, say, from a burning building, and the physiology of hibernating bears.It is difficult to watch ""The Search for Solutions"" from the viewpoint of the youngsters for whom it is primarily intended. A long and distinguished list of academic advisers took part in making it, and a companion study guide will be issued for use by teachers.Thus, the film may well achieve its purpose, but for an adult viewer the segments of only a minute or two or three bring to mind the technique of television commercials, and the connections made between the wildly different disciplines listed above, for example, often seem arbitrary. The narration, by Stacy Keach, often seems both windy and patronizing. At one point he says, for example, ""An idea that works in one situation may not work in another; it has to be appropriate.""Indeed, the failure to examine any of the fields the film touches on and the absence of a coherent historical context create an effect that might almost be described as antiscientific. In this respect, ""The Search for Solutions"" seems much inferior to such series as the ""The Ascent of Man"" and ""Connections"" that have been shown on public television.Technically, however, ""The Search for Solutions"" is quite good. It was produced by James C. Crimmins for Playback Associates, a maker of industrial and documentary films, under a $1.4 million grant from the Phillips Petroleum Company, and directed by Michael Jackson. The filming, mainly documentary but including brief historical re-creations, was done in 14 countries. The proceeds of the scheduled three-week theatrical engagement in New York will be given to the program for minorities in science and engineering at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I.",1979-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Roller Boogie':Round and Round,"A WARM hearty welcome to ""Roller Boogie,"" the dopiest movie of the year. This is a film about blithe young Californians who skate, just skate, that's all they do. A sampling of their conversation may perhaps reveal why they are so little qualified for anything else. Old fogey (he's at least 25): ""I'm off to Arizona to watch the cactus grow."" Kid: ""That'll take forever!"" Boy to girl, very seriously: ""You got a mental problem or somethin'? You wanna skate and then you don't wanna skate? What is it with you?""""Roller Boogie,"" which opens today at the Forum and other theaters, stars chunky little Linda Blair and was directed by Mark Lester, who seems to have expended most of his energies in efforts to make the leading lady look as leggy as the extras. Miss Blair plays a disgustingly carefree rich girl who spends the movie's saddest moments running away from home and sleeping in her lonely sports car. She's supposedly a brilliant flutist, but a musical career means nothing to her (""So what, I'm a musical genius. What a drag!""). The only thing that will make her life worthwhile, she says, will be winning a skating contest with the poor boy  he has to work for a living  who has been giving her lessons. The skating contest becomes the movie's dramatic climax, as well as its only event.Irwin Yablans, the producer credited with the story for ""Roller Boogie,"" seems to have taken most of his dramatic inspiration from old episodes of ""Charlie's Angels."" So the latter half of the movie, after the skating subsides, is devoted to a lot of babble and intrigue about a gangster's taking over the kids' favorite rink. Because the kids are essentially fighting for the right to do nothing all day, and because they pay an awful lot of attention to the cut of the gangster's expensive suits, they don't make especially sympathetic victims.The early moments of the movie, devoted solely to skating, are happily stupid and have a fair amount of physical momentum.

Chance, the hero of Jerzy Kosinski's novel and now his screenplay, is a slow-witted innocent who has spent all his adult life in seclusion, working as a gardener and watching television. These two pursuits, and only these two, have shaped his notion of the rest of the world. ""Being There"" explains, among other things, how illiteracy, ignorance and a sweet attitude can lead to riches, fame and a glamorous social career.Chance, who is played with brilliant understatement by Peter Sellers, is immediately mistaken for Chauncey Gardiner, an aristocratic businessman (because he wears his former benefactor's elegant hand-me-down suits) and witty raconteur (because he laughs at other people's jokes). He is admired for his fluent knowledge of Russian; this comes from nodding knowingly at a Soviet diplomat at a party. Chance also advises the President, and appears on something like ""The Tonight Show."" He has been commenting on how the changing of the seasons means that all is well in the garden, and everone mistakes this for a metaphor about economics.Hal Ashby directs ""Being There"" at an unruffled, elegant pace, the better to let Mr. Sellers's double-edged mannerisms make their full impression upon the audience. Mr. Sellers never strikes a false note, as he exhibits the kind of navet that the film's other characters mistake for eccentricity. Not knowing polite conventions, he answers even perfunctory questions (""Will you be seated?"") with hilariously excessive enthusiasm (""Yes, I will!""). Not knowing figures of speech, he begins standing like a stork when a doctor advises him to keep his weight off one foot. Not knowing the answers to certain questions, he simply doesn't answer them. This impresses his new friends as reticence of the cagiest kind.The other fine actors in ""Being There""Melvyn Douglas as a poignantly ailing rich man, Shirley MacLaine as his sexy, sprightly wife, Jack Warden as a suspicious President and Richard Dysart as the sick man's quietly watchful doctorconspire to accept Chance as a plausible figure, and thereby keep the story in motion. There is superb ensemble playing in ""Being There,"" particularly in scenes that bring Mr. Sellers and Mr. Douglas together. The timing is often so perfect that the film, at its very wittiest, strips conversation down to its barest maneuvers and stratagems.The idea of Chance's miraculous success in the world is a slender one, though, and ""Being There"" eventually takes it farther than it will go. Chance's adventures begin to have a similar ring; the story doesn't so much progress as repeat itself after a while. And Mr. Ashby, who ruptures the film's exaggeratedly uppercrust mood with an early sequence of Chance in the ghetto, and with frequent doses of television noise, stays close to reality when the story most needs its air of the fantastic. The references to television begin delightfully, as when Mr. Ashby cuts from a jubilant mattress commercial to a man on his deathbed. But since the point of these snippets is made early on and then reiterated quite a lot, the film at times begins to drag.There's also something precious about Mr. Ashby's elaborate, solemn, approach to even the most airy and delicate aspects of Chance's story. But for the most part, ""Being There,"" which opens today at the Coronet, moves handsomely, and ingeniously, to make a whimsical dream of a story come true.""Being There"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few sexual references and one relatively discreet masturbation sequence.",1979-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Instead of a hand tapestry technique I use the mechanics of the loom. There's an infinite variety possible, depending on the colors and the width of the stripes. Her weftfaced rugs are either solid or striped. They are durable, meant to be walked on and can be drycleaned. She designs the patterns, draws the designs on graph paper to scale and picks out the colors, but hires other weavers to make them. She also works with designers and clients on special commissions. None of the rugs are more than four feet wide because that's basically the limitation of my loom, she said. The rugs cost $40 a square foot; 4- by 6foot rug is about $1,000.

us,The Screen: Roy Scheider Stars in 'All That Jazz':Peter Pan Syndrome,"JOE GIDEON, the Bob Fosse surrogate figure in ""All That Jazz,"" is riding for a spectacular fall. He is directing and choreographing a new Broadway musical, editing a multimillion dollar film that's months behind schedule and sleeping with as many women as he can sneak into his schedule. Also demanding his time are his beautiful, patient young mistress, his talented, mostly sympathetic former wife and his 12-year-old daughter, who adores him. He smokes too much and drinks heavily. The day begins with Dexedrine, AlkaSeltzer, eyedrops and a hideous confrontation with the face in the mirror.Because Joe Gideon's career closely resembles that of Mr. Fosse, who not only directed and choreographed ""All That Jazz,"" but also wrote the screenplay with the late Robert Alan Aurthur, there will be a tendency to see the film as Mr. Fosse's answer to ""8 ,"" in which Federico Fellini wittily examined his own life at a point when he feared his creativity was at an end. ""All That Jazz"" even looks like a Fellini film  especially ""Juliet of the Spirits""  having been photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno, Fellini's favorite cameraman. But looks and autobiographical details are, I think, deceiving.""All That Jazz"" is much less an ""8 "" than it is the most forthrightly candid variation ever worked out on Peter Pan and all other middle-aged boys who have refused to grow up. The film, which opens today at the Cinema I, is an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego. It's a little bit as if Mr. Fosse had invited us to attend his funeral  the wildest show-business sendoff a fellow ever designed for himself  and then appeared at the door to sell tickets and count the house; after all, funerals are only wasted on the dead.""All That Jazz"" is an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time, but Mr. Fosse, like Barnum & Bailey, believes in giving the customers their money's worth. Some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun. There are big, beautiful, steamy, typically Fosse production numbers, small, intimate dance routines, shots of openheart surgery that may send you under your seat, soul-searching, gags, fantasies, flashbacks and, finally, emerging from the machine-made fog, the figure of a man who isn't always likable but who deserves the attention he affords himself. Not even Fellini, Ingmar Bergman or Woody Allen  all of whom are similarly guilt-ridden  has ever celebrated himself quite so cruelly.However, it's the excesses that make ""All That Jazz"" as appealing as it is, in much the way that Joe Gideon's incredible self-absorption fascinates the people around him. They see it as what they have to put up with to associate with the charm and talent that go with it.We take the flamboyance of ""All That Jazz"" not as an artist's indiscretion but as the fundamental nature of the enterprise. After carefully attending to the screen versions of other people's dreams (""Cabaret"" and ""Lenny""), Mr. Fosse is here attending to his own.A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon. There's an initial shock in seeing Mr. Scheider as the obsessed genius of Broadway. We associate him with the physically tough, none-too-imaginative characters he's played in ""The French Connection,"" ""Jaws"" and ""Sorcerer."" He doesn't seem to be at home in the theater, but it's largely because of this that we come to believe Joe Gideon is as special as Mr. Fosse insists he is.With an actor of less weight and intensity, ""All That Jazz"" might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider's is a presence to reckon with. With him, the film's extraordinary finale becomes coolly comic. He's a defiant Don Giovanni who's beaten not by the Devil but by a coronary occlusion, which may be all that a sinner can hope for in this permissive day and age.The supporting cast is extremely good, beginning with Ann Reinking (""Movie, Movie""), who has legs to match Cyd Charisse's, is a fine dancer and an excellent comedian, who plays Joe Gideon's mistress; Leland Palmer, who plays his former wife; Erzsabet Foldi, as his daughter, and Deborah Geffner as one of his one-night stands. Cliff Gorman, who played Lenny Bruce in the Broadway show but not in Mr. Fosse's film ""Lenny,"" plays Lenny in the film-within-this-film, and Anthony Holland has one very funny scene as a Broadway songwriter.One of Mr. Fosse's lesser inspirationsand the film has more than one  is a character identified in the credits as Angelique, played prettily and vacuously by Jessica Lange. Angelique is a figure who appears in Joe Gideon's fantasies and may possibly be the angel of death. She reminds me more of the sort of flesh-and-blood Tinkerbell who would be the perfect companion to Mr. Fosse's projection of himself as a kid who'd rather die than grow up.Also prominent in the cast are Willian LeMassena, David Margulies and John Lithgow. ""All That Jazz"" demonstrates once again the richness of New York's acting talent.",1979-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Zappa, with the members of his band, performs lengthy musical selections and complains obscurely about his former record company. He and the band also play with a toy police car, a gas mask, and an inflatable female doll, which they maul with either unabashed misogyny or a rather too subtle satirical imitation of same.""Baby Snakes,"" which opens today at the Victoria Theater, also contains sequences of stop-motion clay animation, deftly executed by Bruce Bickford but with an exhausting emphasis upon maggoty shapes and putrefaction. Mr. Zappa, in the production notes, explains the ""story"" of one of the animated sequences this way:""In one scene (and you won't believe this if you haven't seen it yet) two clay people are watching a movie. One guy really likes it. He likes it so much his head turns into a hamburger. He turns to the guy sitting next to him and uses his hamburger-head to bite the face off the other guy, allowing the upper bun to close on the remnants of the victim's features. When it opens again, a tiny version of the victim appears in the middle of the murderous burger patty. Behind the little victim a building grows up (a disco) and dozens of tiny cars (about the size of eraser crumbs) drive through a portal in it.""Mr. Zappa's film includes interviews with his fans, who explain why they think he is so wonderful. ""Baby Snakes"" is for them and them alone.",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Black Hole' By Disney:Ultimate Knowledge,"IF you like outer space, ""The Black Hole"" is the latest version of the next best thing to being there. Produced by the Disney studios, it cost half as much as ""Star Trek"" and looks better  not as lavish, perhaps, but more original. The special effects are fancy, and the design even more so. The sets are so eye-catching, in fact, that they distract attention from the actors, which in movies of this genre is almost always a good idea. The cast includes Anthony Perkins, Maximilian Schell, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimieux, and a robot named Vincent who is a whole lot livelier than his flesh-and-blood friends.Like ""Star Wars,"" which it uses as a point of departure rather than a blue-print, ""The Black Hole"" concentrates on those little, personal touches that can make a spaceship comfy instead of austere. So the bunks of the crew members have Space Art on the walls, and instead of portholes there are big, beautiful picture windows. The emphasis is on homeyness, rather than hardware, and the results are friendly and inviting. The movie's design, by Peter Ellenshaw, borrows from painters like Chagall and Mondrian to achieve a decorative, dated modernism, perhaps to suggest that if we ever do get Out There, our present notions of futuristic design will seem cheerfully quaint with hindsight.The plot, unfortunately, trundles toward that towering bugaboo of science fiction movies, Ultimate Knowledge. One character in this story is after it, and to get what he wants he's willing to turn the others into slaves and ashtrays. His quest will eventually take him into the Hole of the title, which leads the film makers, at the finale, to attempt grandiose effects that, by comparison with the easier gimmicks of the preceding hour and a half, look a little silly. Incidentally, ""The Black Hole"" lasts only 97 minutes, which means not that it is skimpy, but that it's mercifully without padding.""The Black Hole,"" which opens today at Loew's Orpheum 2, is attractively unpretentious and at times quite snappy  among the more sensational stunts is a shot of a huge, molten meteor rolling towards a crew of tiny people, who appear to be right in its path. Its story, about a band of explorers and a wicked space tyrant who pretends to be nice, has a comic-book feeling. But as comic books go, this one is pretty much a page-turner.""The Black Hole"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a couple of mild scares, and a nasty murder.",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

First in Tagaste and then at Hippo, where he was named Bishop, Augustine evolved the doctrines that gave him the reputation as the founder of Christian theology.Knowing that no movie could conceivably cover all of the accomplishments of Augustine's later life, Rossellini here relies on an almost impressionistic approach to facts  with references to the Donatist controversy, the Pelagian heresy, the fall of Rome in 410 (for which the abolition of heathen worship by Christians was blamed) and Augustine's teachings and writings relating to original sin and the sacraments.Though Rossellini's concern for content is as rigorous as it is in his other ""teaching films,"" especially in ""The Age of the Medici"" and ""Socrates,"" the style of ""Augustine"" is unexpectedly cinematic, with lovely sets, costumes, music, sound effects and, seemingly, more camera movements than in all of the other films put together. The color photography is splendid.""Red, White and Zero"" is something else entirely. The best segment is Mr. Anderson's ""The White Bus,"" a surreal, funny examination of postwar England in the form of a guided tour of a dreary English industrial city. The picture was shown in New York some years ago in a Museum of Modern Art retrospective devoted to the director's short films.Mr. Brook's ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" is a hopelessly unfunny slapstick comedy in which the late Zero Mostel plays an opera singer desperately trying to get from the airport to the opera house in time for the wrong performance. Mr. Brook clearly appreciates this kind of comedy, but understands it not at all.Mr. Richardson's ""Red and Blue"" looks to have been fatally influenced by Jacques Brel or maybe Michel Legrand, being an entirely ""sung"" fable about a beautiful, unhappy chanteuse (Vanessa Redgrave) and her affairs with various men played by, among others, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Michael York. The songs, by Cyrus Bassiak and translated by Julian More, are hilariously awful. Sample lyric: ""Orly/Paris/The time is minuit.""",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A New Mastroianni:Romance Across Time,"NASTASSIA KINSKI plays the vixenish young girl who very nearly makes a fool of Marcello Mastroianni in ""Stay as You Are,"" a movie with attractive stars, interesting ambitions and not much follow-through. The premise calls for stable, married, well-heeled Giulio (Mr. Mastroianni) to become smitten with the beautiful Francesca (Miss Kinski), though he knows she's young enough to be his daughter. What he doesn't know, until after they become involved, is that she may very well be his daughter, since her mother was someone he loved and forgot about, just the right number of years ago.Giulio worries about this, of course. What makes the film somewhat novel, or at least modern, is that the intimations of incest don't bother Francesca in the slightest. She likes older men, she explains; that's why she has posters of Hemingway and Einstein on the bedroom wall.And she likes Giulio. And even if he is her father, biologically speaking, he didn't raise her and he hardly knows her and she doesn't have any strong feelings about him one way or the other. She shrugs. Giulio worries. They eventually resolve their differences, but the problem is more engaging than its solution.Mr. Mastroianni attacks his role earnestly, affecting a middle-aged fussiness and seeming genuinely troubled, even torn. He has some excellent moments with a wife and daughter  she is about Francesca's age, and almost as promiscuous  that help supply the film with a broader sense of family relationships, and of the differing mores of different generations.Much of this information is presented and then ignored, but Mr. Mastroianni gives Giulio as much depth as the material will allow. There are hints throughout ""Stay as You Are,"" which was directed by Alberto Lattuada, of the much more memorable movie this might have become.Miss Kinski, who is really the daughter of the German actor Klaus Kinski, looks very little like her father and a lot like the very young, very beautiful Ingrid Bergman. The resemblance is strictly facial and it doesn't go more than skin-deep, perhaps because Miss Kinski's manner and bearing are so much less remarkable than her appearance. She makes a convincingly coltish teen-ager, which is really all this role demands. But she's more captivating to look at than to listen to, and her Francesca eventually becomes terribly whiny, even dull.""Stay as You Are,"" which opens today at the Beekman, is dangerously smarmy at times  dangerous because its cheapness undermines Mr. Mastroianni's essentially serious performance, which is the backbone of the movie. The film works best when the story seems to generate its sexual encounters spontaneously. But there are too many times when the plot looks like a pretext for stringing together amorous interludes.",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Cuba' in Richard Lester's Eyes:Mercenary Madness,"RICHARD LESTER'S ""Cuba,"" which is set in Cuba late in 1958, in the weeks immediately preceding the triumph of Fidel Castro's revolution, is a straightfaced romantic melodrama that's almost as lunatic as Mr. Lester's ""Help!"" and ""How I Won the War,"" both written by Charles Wood, who also wrote the screenplay for the new film.I can't help but suspect that at some point during the production, which was shot in Spain, Mr. Lester and his associates decided that there was absolutely no way to realize the Harold Robbins-like potential of the story and chose, instead, to make a film that is a crazy fanatsy about old-time Hollywood melodramas, the sort turned out by Warner Brothers, directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Humphrey Bogart and perhaps Eleanor Parker. Seeing the film through this fog of memory, you might find it as outrageously endearing as I did.""Cuba,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 1 and other theaters, is about Robert Dapes (Sean Connery), an English mercenary of such high principles you can't believe he'd hire himself out as a dog-catcher, much less as a man brought in by the Batista Government to squash the guerrillas hiding out in the Sierra Maestre. It's also about a rich, beautiful, ambitious, American-sounding Cuban woman, Alexandra Pulido (Brooke Adams), who, 15 years earlier, had an affair with Dapes, but who is now married and happily running a tobacco factory.In the way of Harold Robbins fiction, there are lots of subsidiary characters who may or may not be what they seem  a sweaty American businessman (Jack Weston), Alexandra's weak-willed husband (Chris Sarandon), a venal corporal-turned-Batista general (Martin Balsam), an English entrepreneur of dubious scruples (Denholm Elliott) and a fiery young Fidelista (Danny De La Paz), who spends as much time running around Havana avenging his sister's honor as he does working for a Castro victory.This are a lot of characters to keep track of. To bring them together, Mr. Lester and Mr. Wood rely mainly on coincidence  to such an extent you eventually get the feeling that Cuba is even smaller than Nantucket. Though a lot of the dialogue would seem absurd even on daytime soap opera, the movie keeps coming up with scenes so arresting or eccentric you are aware of the wicked intelligence behind them. No one but Mr. Lester would dare to introduce us to the toppling dictator, at home, as he watches a Dracula movie on television, or to allow his lovers, who've just rediscovered each other, to take a dreamy, idyllic walk through the slums of Havana at sunrise.The members of the excellent supporting cast play the film without ever cracking up, which couldn't have been easy. Mr. Connery dominates things with the benign, elegant manner of a guest who, though perfectly polite, has no intention of staying longer than he has to. Miss Adams seems delighted to be playing opposite such a charming fellow, but there are hints she has no more idea of what's going on than we do.",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Redford-Jane Fonda Comedy:Cowboy and the Lady,"THE movie about the cowboy and the lady has been around a long time, even before there was one called ""The Cowboy and the Lady"" in 1938, when Gary Cooper was the cowboy and Merle Oberon the lady he instructed in nature's improving ways. Just why the story should be so durable I've no idea, unless it reflects our guilty longing to behave morally and ethically in a society that doesn't always pay top-dollar for generous thoughts and proper deportment. The untutored innocent is a steadfastly appealing character, even though you might not want your sister to marry one.Just how durable this story is may be seen in ""The Electric Horseman,"" Sydney Pollack's invigorating new comedy that is acted to the nines by a fine cast, in particular by Robert Redford as an over-the-hill rodeo rider, now the photogenic but boozy spokesman for a cereal called Ranch Breakfast, and Jane Fonda as a reporter who goes after him for a story and winds up with considerably more. The film opens today at Loews Twin 2 and other theaters.Robert Garland's screenplay sounds as hip as a television talk-show host's opening monologue, what with references to conglomerates, the celebrity of television journalists, Las Vegas and Madison Avenue, but down-deep the movie's heart is pure 1938, which is not at all bad. Further, Mr. Redford and Miss Fonda are not only excellent actors, but they are also among the few actors of our day who qualify as screen personalities on the order of Cooper and Miss Oberon or John Wayne and Jean Arthur, who did this turn in 1943 in ""The Lady Takes a Chance.""""The Electric Horseman"" even advocates a kind of appealingly dopey populism that isn't much different from that of ""The Cowboy and the Lady"" and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" which may help put Miss Fonda's well-publicized political opinions into historical context. Our Rosa Luxemburg turns out to be only a little to the left of Shirley Temple Black. The film is, I think, anti-Big Business, though not in any revolutionary way, and demonstrates how a straight-thinking loner, with the help of the television newswoman who loves him, can bring to its knees a conglomerate the size of Gulf & Western.However, the point of the screenplay is not its politics, but its gently satiric view of some aspects of contemporary life as represented by the cowboy, Sonny (Mr. Redford), and Hallie (Miss Fonda), the sharp-as-nails lady from back East. They come together at a huge Las Vegas convention designed to celebrate the corporate swallowing up of something called Omnibank by another company, the seemingly evilly named Amco.Sonny, whose Ranch Breakfast contract is owned by Amco, sobers up long enough to object to the manner in which Amco flunkies are mistreating a prize-winning racehorse named Rising Star. In a moment of decision, Sonny steals the horse and rides serenely away from the splendors of Caesar's Palace and Las Vegas, planning to turn Rising Star loose in the sheltered foothills of Utah.The movie has a good deal of fun at the expense of corporate clichs, which aren't always benign, but it only hits its stride when Sonny and Hallie are on the great trail to horse freedom, pursued by the state police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and character assassins in the pay of Amco.Miss Fonda, in addition to being a fine dramatic actress, is a first-rate comedian, whether she's stumbling over a Utah mountain in her chic, spike-heeled, patent-leather boots or suddenly becoming shy after a night well spent in the cowboy's sleeping bag.Mr. Redford is equally funny and equally at ease, both in the early sections of the film as the duded-up, break-fast-food spokesman and, later, as the natural man who realizes his particular American dream.Mr. Pollack has also cast the supporting roles with care, especially Willie Nelson, the country-music star, as Sonny's laid-back rodeo pal; Valerie Perrine as Sonny's sweet but not infinitely patient former wife, and John Saxon as the amusingly ruthless head of Amco.At this point, I think it's reasonably safe to say that ""The Electric Horseman"" is the best American romantic comedy of 1979.""The Electric Horseman,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some slightly vulgar language and some harmless references to sexual congress.",1979-12-21T05:00:00+0000

Sent out, in several greedy teams, to compete for the estate of a mean old moneybags (Vincent Price), they bring back five ostriches, a toilet, a beehive, a stuffed fish, and nothing funnier. Some of the film's more likable actors  Cleavon Little, James Coco, Robert Morley, Tony Randall, Scatman Crothers  behave as if the material were cleverer than it is, and their composure amounts to the movie's only real peculiarity. Otherwise, it's just a broad, low comedy full of speech defects and pratfalls. Here's pie in your eye.Cloris Leachman and Richard Benjamin, with Richard Masur as their idiot protege, play the villains; in this case, that just means they holler louder than the others. Roddy MacDowall, Cleavon Little and James Coco, as the dead tycoon's butler, chauffeur and cook, bring a little class to a movie that doesn't need any. Stephanie Faracy, who gave such a convincing performance as a plain, overweight waitress in ""When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?"" is transformed into a svelte Fifi the French Maid character, although in this case the name is Babbette. There are also a lot of brief cameo appearances, by Meat Loaf, Ruth Gordon and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, that could have been briefer.""Scavenger Hunt,"" which opens today at the Embassy I and other theaters, was directed by Michael Schultz, whose talents don't seem entirely suited to the material. Mr. Schultz, also responsible for ""Cooley High,"" ""Car Wash"" and ""Greased Lightning,"" has previously been capable of more sharply honed work than the present material allows for. When a movie's jokes are so noticeably without punch lines, only a mood of uproarious confusion can save the day.

The idea caught on.

Each day is like every other. They sit around and stare at the walls or, if the weather is nice, they amble to the park.Surprisingly, because he is a retired taxicab driver, Willie is the most passive one of the group. He's also infinitely polite. Whatever anyone says is all right by Willie. Al is the occasional joker and Joe has the brains. One day when Joe suggests they stick up a bank, Willie and Al agree. As Joe points out, they can't lose. If they succeed, they'll be rich. If they're caught, they'll receive, at most, three years in jail, during which time they'll live off the Government while their Social Security checks accumulate.""Going in Style,"" a first commercial feature written and directed by Martin Brest, means to be both moving and comic, but though the cast is headed by three fine actors, two of whom, Mr. Burns and Mr. Carney, are also extremely funny men, it never elicits any emotional response more profound than curiosity. There are isolated moments that are amusing  the bank holdup, a brief spree at the Las Vegas gaming tables, some lines delivered by Mr. Burns (""If that kid eats any more jelly doughnuts, they'll have to take him to kindergarten in a moving van""). The lower-middle-class milieu is nicely observed through Billy Williams's photography.Mostly, ""Going in Style,"" which opens today at the Sutton and other theaters, is as uneventful as the lives it records. Death stalks these characters not like the Grim Reaper, but like a bored meter reader.Here is a movie that might well have been helped had its three stars refused to act so legitimately. Their material isn't good enough for them, which is particularly apparent when Mr. Brest reaches for pathos. At one point, Mr. Strasberg throws everything he knows about acting into a monologue about a dead son, but our interest is less emotional than clinical.""Going in Style"" is so humdrum I suspect it could only interest people whose outlooks are even more so. Perhaps the recently departed.""Going in Style,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some vulgar language.",1979-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Declaring itself open to all independent thoughts and new ideas, the magazine has as the keynote of its first issue a photograph showing the Soviet police breakup of a dissident art exhibition in Moscow in 1974. From there it goes on to essays and interviews that examine the work of contempory unofficial artists of every stripe, including the conceptualist team of Rimma and Valery Gerlovin, and Erik Bulatov, a realist painter who satirizes the deadly officialdom of Soviet life. It also presents, in line with the magazine's aim of publicizing unknown documents of the early Russian avantgarde, a 1920 excerpt from the diary of Kasimir Malevich, the Constructivist artist whose work is now banned from public view in the Soviet Union. And it interviews Russian artists on their impressions of the New York art scene (New York impressed me the most when I saw it from above, says one, Genrich Khudyakov); includes a review of last year's Jasper Johns retrospective at the Whitney Museum by Aleksandr Kosolapov, a sculptor who now lives in New York, and winds up with some scathing comments on the recent ParisMoscow show at the Pompidou Center in Paris. One quote, from the dissident Soviet writer Andrei Sinyaysky: Now the Soviet power promotes this Russian avantgarde, that it itself has crushed, in a Parisian exhibition. What led it to do so?

Contributing to these mixed feelings were two colossal disappointments (Bernardo Bertolucci's Luna and Steven Spielberg's 1941), one movie so overreviewed while it was in production (Apocalypse Now) that its release had to be an anticlimax, plus a couple of arid patches when, as during the fall, there was very little to shout about. Then, too, there was an extraordinar, amount of junk. In spite of what most people think, it is not much fun to write about pictures like Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline, Hurricane, The Champ and the spectacle of Mae West losing her formidable race with the clock in Sextette.

Take the antiestablishment 60's, for instance: the untamed manes of the flower children, the faded jeans of the affluencerejecting hippies, the discarded bras of the women's liberation movement, the kneefreeing skirts of Courreges, and the streetimitating gear of the radical chic. At first glance, the sartorial symbols of the 60's  wacky, vinylbright miniskirts and tattered hippy garb  may seem to have little in common.
