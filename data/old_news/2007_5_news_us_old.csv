The London judge, Peter Smith, ruled that Mr. Chiluba, in power from 1991 to 2001, was uniquely positioned to stop corruption in government, but that he elected instead to join in it. Zambias government sued in London because it alleged that Mr. Chiluba and his associates had bought assets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Mr. Chiluba said in a statement that he did not recognize a British courts authority in Zambian issues, arguing that the case circumvented Zambias justice system.

Brazil said the company had offered a 30 percent discount, but the government opted instead to buy the generic version from India for less than $170. For years, Brazil has considered exercising its rights under international trade rules to make or import generic versions of patented AIDS drugs, but has until now backed away, fearing trade retaliation from the United States. For more than a decade, Brazil has provided universal free access to drug treatment for people with AIDS. Almost one in four patients in Brazil are now taking efavirenz. With the new price, Brazil estimates that it will save $237 million on efavirenz by 2012 when the patent expires.

This dubious compliment, which all teachers of creative writing might wish to employ, failed to discourage Dunash. He took himself, and his new poetry, back home to Muslim Spain. There, despite the dismay his mediocre verses prompted in other aspiring Hebrew poets, his style caught on. Within a few decades, from these unpromising origins, a brilliant and original body of Hebrew verse began to take shape. Virtually stagnant since late Biblical times, Hebrew poetry and the language itself would be transformed by a succession of poets of genius and their imitators.

There was so much hype  inevitable word  over Nirvana and its demise that the music later seemed somehow buried beneath the ephemera it occasioned. It became almost embarrassing to listen, in ones dorm room, to Cobains strangely sarcastic and inviting voice, when journalists had called him the voice of our generation. And the bands tortured ambivalence over its tremendous popularity grew to seem sadly quaint. When Nevermind came out, the marketing of the Persian Gulf war as a blockbuster action film was a fresh outrage, as was the recruitment of the Beatles song Revolution as an advertising jingle; we were not yet thoroughly familiar with the emotional indecency of commercialization. We are now four years into the gulf wars skillfully marketed sequel, while Cobains widow, Courtney Love, has recently licensed her husbands song Breed for use by a manufacturer of video games.

us,Why Not the Worst?,"Last year, I stumbled upon a remarkable book called The Talisman of Troy. Written by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, The Talisman of Troy chronicled the adventures of Diomedes, a second-tier hero in the Iliad, after the fall of Troy. Bristling with sentences like Anchialus shuddered: in that boy was the awesome power of the son of Peleus, but not a crumb of his fathers piety, nor his hospitable manners, the novel advanced the theory that Helen of Troy had not really been abducted by Paris, son of Priam, but had deliberately gone to Asia Minor in order to get her hands on a sacred totem  the talisman of Troy  that would enable women to rule the world. The book is thus one of lifes unalloyed pleasures: an uncompromisingly stupid novel in a world filled with stupid novels that do make compromises. And, by virtue of its faux Hellenic inanity and all-purpose Delphic hootiness, it is also a powerful weapon in the hands of those of us who work night and day to resist the tyranny of the good.",2007-05-06T04:00:00+0000

Located in Big Sur, California, just off Highway 1 on approximately one hundred and fifty acres of stunning natural beauty, Esalen is, geographically speaking, a cliff suspended about one hundred feet above the crashing surf and kelp-congested tides of the Pacific Ocean. By all measures, it is a stunning place, replete with natural beauty and a certain physical paradox, partly produced by the proximate presence of mountains and ocean; indeed, the rocky heights seem to drop directly into the watery depths here or, more true to the place's primeval geological history, it is as if the heights rise up out of the depths. Henry Miller called Big Sur ""a religion where extremes meet."" Indeed. The physical paradox of the land is deepened further by a simple, but somehow profound, historical and geographic fact: these, after all, are grounds that both constitute the very edge of the American frontier and look due west to see the East.

As Everett sits in his apartment, reading the paper and sipping a martini, a pair of warm eyes unexpectedly meets his, and his world turns from blas to ros. Everett experienced an unfamiliar sensation, Schine writes. He was suddenly, intensely aware of the room around him, of the soft order of his furnishings and his life, of the soft order outside where day was giving way to night, of the TV sounds and the cold wet of the martini glass, of the smudgy feel of newsprint on his fingers, but mostly he was aware of joy  the wild, clattering joy of being alive.

Coulton is 36 and shaggily handsome. In September 2005, he quit his job as a computer programmer and, with his wifes guarded blessing, became a full-time singer and songwriter. He set a quixotic goal for himself: for the next year, he would write and record a song each week, posting each one to his blog. It was a sort of forced-march approach to creativity, he admitted to me over the sound of the cafes cappuccino frothers. Hed always wanted to be a full-time musician, and he figured the only way to prove to himself he could do it was with a drastic challenge. I learned that it is possible to squeeze a song out of just about anything, he said. But its not always an easy or pleasant process. Given the self-imposed time constraints, the Thing a Week songs are remarkably good. Coulton tends toward geeky, witty pop tunes: one song, Tom Cruise Crazy, is a sympathetic ode to the fame-addled star, while Code Monkey is a rocking anthem about dead-end programming jobs. By the middle of last year, his project had attracted a sizable audience. More than 3,000 people, on average, were visiting his site every day, and his most popular songs were being downloaded as many as 500,000 times; he was making what he described as a reasonable middle-class living  between $3,000 and $5,000 a month  by selling CDs and digital downloads of his work on iTunes and on his own site.",2007-05-13T04:00:00+0000

Chabon, starting with himself as writers should, seems determined in The Yiddish Policemens Union to stave off wistfulness by any means, even if it requires him to turn the story of the endless, endemic disappointment of the Jews  their millenniums-old-and-counting wait for the Messiah  into a screwball, alternative-reality, hard-boiled mystery, set, for maximum incongruity, in Alaska. The impressively wacky premise is that after the Holocaust, large numbers of Jews were relocated to Sitka, where by statute they were allowed to make their home for the next 60 years, at the end of which the town would revert to the control of Alaska. Israel, it appears, didnt work out: the Jewish settlers there were ejected with savage finality in 1948.

I find the suggestion that Hagels run would hurt a Republican presidential candidate, which Ive seen in a couple of places, rather ludicrous. Hagel is widely despised within the party, and the last poll I saw had him at 1% among Republicans. My guess is that a large majority of those yearning for a Hagel candidacy would otherwise vote for the Democrat.",2007-05-15T13:23:45+0000

Don Muang carries the airport code DMK and is used mainly for domestic flights.

Heres the most important thing to know about Suvarnabhumi: its pronounced Sawana-phoom. If you pronounce it the way its spelled, no one will understand you. Peak time for international flights at Suvarnabhumi is the evening. Check-in lines, especially for Thai Airways, which now uses the single check-in line system, can be very long.

What those menus dont say is that, unlike real truffles, the aroma of truffle oil is not born in the earth.

The original verdict, in which a jury awarded $81 million to seven plaintiffs, was reduced by the trial judge in 2004 to $635,000, city officials said. In a ruling released yesterday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court found that videotapes of the confrontation did not support the contention that the police had acted improperly. After reviewing the tapes, the judges said that the police were justified in their belief that the protest could escalate and that officers appropriately tried to quell a quickly unfolding, potentially explosive situation. Mark Kressner, the plaintiffs lawyer, said they would appeal on the grounds that the trial jury made the correct decision after carefully reviewing the evidence.

Robert Kennedy gravitated immediately to a shadowy nexus of forces he believed were at odds with the policies of his brothers administration. Was it the C.I.A.? he asked John McCone, the director of central intelligence. Was the assassination the work of anti-Castro Cubans? Was it the American Mafia? Or was it  since there were hidden but important connections among these groups  a combined effort by them all? Before he had ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald, Robert Kennedy was considering scenarios that would eventually become the foundation of the myriad conspiracy theories that have haunted the American imagination for more than 40 years; according to David Talbot, he continued to explore those scenarios until his own death in 1968, even while publicly denying his belief in a conspiracy.

In a single paragraph, he lucidly explains the basic physics of the uranium-based atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Once a professional pilot, and the author of Inside the Sky, Langewiesche then leads the reader inside the pressurized, well-heated cockpit of the Enola Gay, flying at 31,000 feet in smooth air, piloted by the young Colonel Paul Tibbets, and vividly reconstructs the evasive maneuver taken by the B-29 as it banks steeply to minimize the coming shockwaves, while the bomb, named Little Boy, falls for 43 seconds before igniting several miles below, lighting the sky with the prettiest blues and pinks that Tibbets had ever seen. Tibbetss subsequent career, from Air Force general to Internet purveyor of autographed souvenirs of that momentous flight, is adroitly sketched. The bombing of Nagasaki three days after Hiroshima, with a plutonium device, is handled in brisk but sufficient detail.

John Steinbeck praised Al Capps dialogue in his Lil Abner cartoons. Tallulah Bankhead said she envied Adlai Stevensons campaign speeches. Edna Ferber singled out her own novel Giant. (Cmon, people.) Then there was Ralph Ellison, whose first novel, Invisible Man, had been published earlier that year. The book Ellison said he wished hed written was Wright Morriss novel The Works of Love. This made a certain amount of sense; Morris was a forceful and worthy, if ultimately minor, writer. Ellisons pick made even more sense if you recalled that Morris had effusively reviewed Ellisons own novel in the Book Review, calling it a resolutely honest, tormented, profoundly American book.

Along with the three-year-old fashion boutique Skye (2) (1499 Blake Street; 303-623-0444), still the only game in town for avant-garde labels like Alexandre Herchcovitch and Heatherette, there's the Fabric Lab (3105 East Colfax Avenue; 303-321-3604) and Fancy Tiger (1 South Broadway; 303-733-3855).

More than just a charming tradition, the childs play commemorates a key victory in a hard-fought, ongoing war. Back in 1972, the new mayor of the city, an architect and urban planner named Jaime Lerner, ordered a lightning transformation of six blocks of the street into a pedestrian zone. The change was recommended in a master plan for the city that was approved six years earlier, but fierce objections from the downtown merchants blocked its implementation. Lerner instructed his secretary of public works to institute the change quickly and asked how long it would take. He said he needed four months, Lerner recalled recently. I said, Forty-eight hours. He said, Youre crazy. I said, Yes, Im crazy, but do it in 48 hours.  The municipal authorities were able to accomplish it in three days, beginning on a Friday night and installing paving, lighting, planters and furniture by the end of the day on Monday. Being a very weak mayor, if I start to do it and take too long, everyone could stop it through a juridical demand, Lerner went on to explain. If they stop the work, its finished.

us,The Atomic Bazaar," Hiroshima was destroyed in a flash by a bomb dropped from a propeller-driven B-29 of the U.S. Army Air Corps, on the warm morning of Monday, August 6, 1945. The bomb was not chemical, as bombs until then had been, but atomic, designed to release the energies that Einstein had described. It was a simple cannon-type device of the sort that today any number of people could build in a garage. It was bulbous and black, about ten feet long, and weighed ninety-seven hundred pounds. It fell nose-down for forty-three seconds and, for maximum effect, never hit the ground. One thousand nine hundred feet above the city it fired a dull gray plug of highly enriched uranium down a steel tube into a receiving lump of the same refined material, creating a combined uranium mass of 133 pounds. In relation to its surface area, that mass was more than enough to achieve ""criticality"" and allow for an uncontrollable chain of fission reactions, during which subatomic particles called neutrons collided with uranium nuclei, releasing further neutrons, which collided with other nuclei, in a blossoming process of self-destruction. The reactions could be sustained for just a millisecond, and they fully exploited less than two pounds of the uranium atoms before the resulting heat forced a halt to the process through expansion. Uranium is one of the heaviest elements on earth, almost twice as heavy as lead, and two pounds of it amounts to only about three tablespoonfuls. Nonetheless the release of energy over Hiroshima yielded a force equivalent to fifteen thousand tons (fifteen kilotons) of TNT, achieved temperatures higher than the sun's, and emitted light-speed pulses of lethal radiation. More than 150,000 people died. ",2007-05-20T06:07:00+0000

They reaped the rewards of their grandfather's financial acumen, legal expertise, and common sense; and Sterling and Stephen, if not the other two, also felt the imprint of Edward's personality. While on the surface Edward, a Sunday-school teacher as well as a lawyer, was a man of traditional bearing who comported himself with conservative demeanor, he was intensely strong-willed, determined, and uncompromising, as well as crafty. Even if their own father, Edward's son Alfred, was a bird of a different feather, Edward's triumph in the world of commerce gave Sterling and Stephen their mettle and sense of entitlement.

Walter Geist's blindness is important, but it's my own, with regard to him, that remains a lasting regret. It's the reason for this story.

That continues a trend: The R.N.C. has outraised the D.N.C. every month this calendar year.The R.N.C. raised $33 million in the first four months of this year and had $14.2 million in cash on hand; the committee was debt-free as May began. The D.N.C. has raised $19.7 million this year and had available cash of $6.1 million, with debts of $3 million.The D.N.C. has lower cash on hand than the R.N.C. because it has spent a greater percentage of its receipts  in part because the D.N.C. pays salaries for party personnel in all 50 states. The D.N.C., which has vowed to be more competitive in traditionally Republican-leaning states and districts, spent about $921,000 on staff salaries in April.",2007-05-23T14:05:54+0000

The museum is entered through the back side of Romes ugliest monument, Il Vittoriano, a bright white late 19th Century creation to commemorate Italian unification. (For those who have just done the Schnabel exhibit, Il Vittoriano is the bright white monstrosity right across Piazza Venezia.) The Chagalls could be better organized and displayed, but there are dozens of terrific paintings spanning 6 decades of the artists work. Particularly interesting for those in Rome who are overdosed on traditional religious art, are Chagalls unconventional renderings of the Bible, in which Jesus is shown with all the trappings of Judaism (notice the Torah), placed in what looks like Chagalls birthplace in a village in Russia. To finish your visit, head upstairs to the museums outdoor cafe, on a terrace overlooking the ruins of the Imperial Forum. The coffee is excellent. The sangria not bad. Most important, the terrace has one of the best panoramas of Rome, with excellent signs that help you make sense of the forest of spires and arches you are seeing. Just FYI this outing is very kid-friendly; I did this one with my 15-year-old, who loved both the art and the view. ",2007-05-23T17:27:15+0000

But in the second half he turned things around and led Tel Aviv to the playoffs, where the team is still alive. The Seattle SuperSonics chose Halperin in the second round of the 2006 draft and still own his N.B.A. rights, but will likely not make a decision about his future until June, according to the agent, Jason Levien. For now, Halperin is keeping his thoughts on an N.B.A. career to himself. There was so much media hype and attention about him playing in the N.B.A. that he is not talking to the media about it right now, Levien said.

With the Democrats having about a 57 percent chance of winning the election and with Obama and Gore having above 50 percent chances of winning, the 80 percent (40/50) that Hillary has looks awfully suspect and I assume someone is manipulating the 40 percent number to make Hillary look better. With the efficient market hypothesis in mind, is this at all possible or is an arbitrage opportunity available?Mankiw tells us how to use this anomaly to our advantage: Sell Clinton (bid is now 38.3), Obama (16.5), Gore (7.3), and Edwards (3.6) for a total of 65.7. Buy a contract for a generic Democratic win (ask is now 56.8). You pocket the difference (65.7-56.8=8.9). You have to pay out on the first contract if one of these four candidates wins, but in that case you are covered by the second contract. The only contingency in which you lose is if Clinton, Obama, Gore, or Edwards end up president as an independent or Republican candidate, which seems completely unlikely.So why am I giving away this arbitrage opportunity for free?

The session had been stopped to clean up the oil, but seven minutes was not enough time for the 26 cars to get a good shot at setting a good lap time.

But Mark Reiter tackles it with elegance and wit in his recent book The Enlightened Bracketologist: The Final Four of Everything, which he wrote with Richard Sandomir and Nigel Holmes. According to Reiter, the novels that make it to Leonards final four are Hombre (1961), Swag (1976), LaBrava (1983) and Killshot (1989). Its hard to quibble with that list. LaBrava got there by defeating, in the second round, Get Shorty. (Reiter calls this an ironic matchup, since Leonard wrote Get Shorty to get back at Dustin Hoffman for torturing him during the writing of the LaBrava screenplay.) The final matchup, in Reiters bracket, is between Swag and Killshot. Ill let Reiter describe which book wins:  Swag is great because you root for the crooks. Killshot goes it one better with Leonards best-ever opening chapter, a cast of kinky characters who are both menacing and sympathetic, and the rarity of a happily married couple as the novels action heroes. Even the blunt title is perfect. Leonards new novel, Up in Honeys Room, is at No. 15.",2007-05-27T04:00:00+0000

The cold weather of April had held back the flowering of many of the spring bulbs, and with the warmth of the first week of summer there had been a sudden burst of growth. The verges of the country lanes were frothing with cow parsley while late primroses still dotted the roadside banks. Top-hatted men strolling in the London parks had decided it was warm enough to abandon their scarves. Straw-bonneted women had gathered up country bluebells to sell in wilting bunches on street corners in the smarter parts of London, and window boxes were already spilling over with scarlet geraniums and marguerites. Tiny pink flowers covered the branches that would later produce crab apples, while the ocean of white blossoms produced by other fruit trees had prompted Country Life to declare that 'few people can remember any parallel to its profusion.' England was plump with promise. ",2007-05-27T16:57:00+0000
us,The Occupation of Iraq," Conflicts and wars fought on its territory have always been the lot of Iraq. It has had the geographic misfortune of lying across the fault lines of civilisations and empires, and its peoples have suffered the waves of conquerors and battles fought over its lands. The ebb and flow of powers that controlled its destiny always left behind a residue that helped to form the profile of the modern Iraqi. But these were not accretions that melded together to form a common sense of nationhood. The shared history and experiences of Iraqis did not give rise to unifying national myths. The legacy of pre-Islamic civilisations - of Sumer, Babylon and Nineveh - was not one that could be readily adapted to the formation of national identity. The pride that came from knowing that Iraq was the land that gave humanity settled agriculture, its first cities and the alphabet, was not internalised. Iraq's ancient history featured only on the periphery of the identity of Muslim Iraqis. Various modern governments have tried to make the connection and continuity with this heritage - sometimes ludicrously, as when Saddam Hussein appropriated the heritage of the lawmaker Hammurrabi and stuck his name on the (rebuilt) walls of Babylon. But it was never pursued with the intent of forming a national consciousness. ",2007-05-27T16:57:00+0000

These were kiddie places, she told me. Her children now had more mature tastes. They liked refined forms of entertainment - art museums, the theater, ballet. Isn't that something? My sister's children's bodies were lengthening, and so were their attention spans. They could sit for hours at a performance of Macbeth without so much as checking the seat bottom for fossilized wads of gum. No more of this mad pinball pinging from one hands-on science exhibit to the next, pounding on knobs to make artificial earthquakes, or cranking gears to see Newton's laws in motion, or something like that; who bothers to read the explanatory placards anyway? And, oops, hmm, hey, Mom, this thing seems to have stopped working! No more aping the gorillas or arguing over the structural basis of a polar bear's white coat or wondering about the weird goatee of drool gathering on the dromedary's chin. Sigh.

us,The Last Tycoons," Even among the great Wall Street firms-Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch-Lazard Frres & Co. stood apart, explicitly priding itself on being different from, and superior to, its competitors. For 157 years, Lazard had punched above its weight. Unlike other Wall Street banks, it competed with intellectual rather than financial capital and through a hard-won tradition of privacy and independence. Its strategy, put simply, was to offer clients the wisdom of its Great Men, the finest and most experienced collection of investment bankers the world had ever known. They risked no capital, offering only the raw Darwinian power of their ideas. The better the idea, and the insights and tactics required to achieve the result contemplated by it, the greater was Lazard's currency as a valued and trusted adviser-and the larger were the piles of money the Great Men hauled out of the firm and into their swelling bank accounts. The lucky few men-yes, always men-at Wall Street's summit have always been portrayed as ambitious and brilliant on the one hand and unscrupulous and ruthless on the other. But the secret history of Lazard Frres & Co., the world's most elite and enigmatic investment bank, twists parts of this conventional wisdom into knots of unfathomable complexity. The Great Men chronicled herein amassed huge fortunes-to be sure-but they refused to admit to anyone, least of all to themselves, that their pursuit of these riches led to relentless infighting. Instead they spoke, without irony, of being part of a Florentine guild and of advice whispered to heads of state and to CEOs of the world's most powerful corporations, while all the time attempting to preserve the mythical special idea that was Lazard. They also, to a person, craved an equally elusive chimera: the assurance that somehow, despite everything, they alone had remained virtuous. ",2007-05-27T16:57:00+0000

Her bared brown shoulders and womanly bosom rose powerfully, as she drew in her breath and gazed across the heads of the seated diners at the distant autocue. She gleamed and rippled with smooth muscle, like a fish. She was boldly dressed, for a woman in her sixties, but she came of a bold generation, and she seemed confident that the shadowy shoals of her cohort were gathered around her in massed support as she flaunted herself upon the podium. She felt the dominion. It pumped through her, filling her with the adrenalin of exposure. She was ready for her leap. ",2007-05-27T16:57:00+0000

Up to 20 paddlers cram, in pairs, into long, narrow wooden boats that  to the delight of onlookers  are apt to tipping over at the hands of the unskilled. The front is adorned with a colorful, ornate dragons head. This is also where the drummer sits, to beat out time for the rowers to row to. And whats there not to love about a sport with a designated drummer? At the back is the steerer, like a coxswain.The races are short  sprints, actually  done in heats.

But the most striking manifestation of that trend for now is the boom in religion in China, and the way most people in most of the country can worship freely most of the time. And I agree with Li Baiguang that in 20 or 30 years China could have several hundred million Christians, making it the largest Christian country in the world. In most of the world, economic development has eroded religious faith, but in China its working the other way and theres a considerable parallel with South Korea and its embrace of Christianity in the 20th century.",2007-05-31T00:58:41+0000
