But let this be an alert to all lovers of superb pianism. This is a timely and revealing release. Malcuzynski (1914-77) had trouble escaping the shadow of the older Polish pianist Arthur Rubinstein. Still, he was indeed a master, a probing musician incapable of expressive indulgence, a pianist with a brilliant and admirably unflashy technique. He was best known for his Chopin performances and this set includes waltzes, polonaises, scherzos and the Second Concerto. I am especially captivated by his fleet, no-nonsense account of Rachmaninoffs Third Concerto, his majestic, granitic playing of Brahmss First and what has now become one of my favorite recordings of Brahmss Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Handel. There are works by Liszt, Beethoven, Debussy, Szymanowski and more. (Anthony Tommasini)",2014-10-01T18:37:48+0000

In port was the French gunboat La Zle, without her guns or her crew. La Zle is a gunboat of 647 tons, entirely unprotected. The two large armored cruisers of 11,600 tons, each armed with eight 210mm. guns, six 150mm. guns and twenty 88mm. guns, heroically sank our little ship at anchor, deprived of all means of attack or defence. To complete this laudable feat, the German cruisers bombarded and half destroyed Papeete. Then they steamed away. All ports in the Pacific being occupied by Anglo-French forces, the career of the Scharnhorst and of the Gneisenau must inevitably soon come to an end, for coaling for them will soon become impossible and they will have to measure themselves against, not a little wooden hull without arms or defenders, but against real warships, the French, British, Japanese and Russian cruisers which are seeking them in the Pacific.

One reads this now with an ironic chuckle. As we approach the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Holocaust, among all its other perverse distinctions, has become the most documented genocide in history.

Featuring contributions from members of Belle and Sebastian and Teenage Fanclub and recorded in the studio of Mogwai, its a reflection of the close-knit musical community in the Vaseliness hometown of Glasgow.

At the movies, economic injustice is occasionally grist for allegory  as in Bong Joon-Hos Snowpiercer, the action-movie sleeper of the summer  and more frequently an axiom of realism.

But the 250th anniversary of his death offers an ideal peg for a new staging of his Les Ftes de lHymen et de lAmour, ou Les Dieux dgypte (The Celebrations of Marriage and Love, or The Gods of Egypt), which will be performed in New York on Thursday. Rameaus orchestration and harmony were both revolutionary and controversial. Some 18th-century listeners rejected his musical aesthetic, which was inspired in part by science and philosophy. Dance was also a crucial element for Rameau; Louis de Cahusac, the librettist of this court opera (first performed in 1747) integrated dance into the plot instead of using it merely as a decorative device. Opera Lafayettes production features three diverse troupes  New York Baroque Dance Company (representing a group of Egyptians); Kalanidhi Dance (as a tribe of Amazons); and the Sean Curran Company(as an irate God and his followers).

In this evening-length work, she laces new movement material with remnants from past dances. Ms. Melnick, whose canvas is her body, creates a landscape of ever-changing forms.

Now, new reporting on the frenzied days leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers reveals there was indeed a group inside the Fed who believed at the time that the bank could legally be saved.

Suffers a Relapse,"A child in Milan treated early and aggressively with AIDS drugs after being born with H.I.V. suffered a rebound of the virus soon after stopping the drugs, according to a new study in The Lancet. Italian doctors had originally hoped the child could survive without drugs, as a baby born in rural Mississippi in 2010 appeared to do for more than a year. But in July, pediatricians announced that the Mississippi baby had relapsed, indicating that early treatment had not wiped out all the reservoirs of virus. The Milan child was 3 years old in late 2012 and had no detectable virus in blood tests when treatment was stopped, but the virus surged after two weeks. The Milan child was more obviously infected than the Mississippi one, said Dr. Sharon Lewin, a prominent Australian AIDS researcher who is familiar with both cases, because he had other infection markers, including H.I.V.-specific white blood cells.",2014-10-03T22:22:27+0000

Twenty-two Vietnamese and one U.S. soldier were killed. Forty-three other government troops were wounded and 14 were missing. A U.S. military spokesman said the Viet Cong numbered about 1,000. The ambush followed a government victory yesterday when Vietnamese Rangers killed 59 Viet Cong and captured 36 in the swampy Camau peninsula 140 miles southwest of the capital. The ambush came as two companies of Vietnamese infantry were returning on foot from a mission. The U.S. soldier killed was a sergeant. His body was airlifted from the scene along with a wounded U.S. adviser. Replying to a call for help, government helicopters and fighter bombers attacked the Viet Cong. Ground forces were also sent to relieve the government troops but the Viet Cong had already with-drawn by the time the relief columns arrived. In the capital, convoys of armed paratroopers moved through crowded city streets to ward off any new violence following the explosion of a hand grenade in a crowded newspaper distribution center, where one person was killed and 40 were injured.

USA Today reports that researchers at the Walt Disney Animation Research Library have discovered that a bird with a New York accent was the original sidekick for the evil sorceress Maleficent in Disneys 1959 classic, Sleeping Beauty. An early clip of the film shows the cultured vulture in a comic-relief role, trying to disguise himself as less-threatening animals to spy on Princess Aurora. In the end, Sleeping Beautys curse was broken, but the vulture wasnt so lucky. It didnt add much to the story and also somewhat detracted from that imposing nature of the villain Maleficent, Fox Carney, the research manager from Disneys library, told USA Today. And this New York type of vulture didnt fit into the world of this classic medieval Europe where this film is set. Scenes featuring the original bird will be in bonus features of a Blu-ray edition of Sleeping Beauty due out on Tuesday.",2014-10-05T21:50:34+0000
us,Protesters Delay St. Louis Symphony,"The St. Louis Symphonys performance of Brahmss German Requiem was briefly upstaged at a concert on Saturday night when audience members used their own music to protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The demonstration began after intermission and just before the orchestra started playing, Adam Crane, the symphonys vice president for external affairs, said by phone on Sunday. Mr. Crane was participating in a live radio broadcast of the performance from Powell Hall in St. Louis, when a man stood up in the theater and sang, Which side are you on, friend, which side are you on? The man was joined by demonstrators throughout the audience in singing, Justice for Mike Brown is justice for all. Mr. Crane estimated that about 50 people from among the roughly 1,500 in attendance participated. Banners were lowered from the balcony reading, Requiem for Mike Brown 1996-2014, Racism lives here and Rise up and join the movement, The St. Louis American reported. Some members of the audience and orchestra applauded the protest, which Mr. Crane said lasted three to five minutes and ended peacefully when the participants left while chanting, Black lives matter. The event was organized by Sarah Griesbach, 42, who told The St. Louis American that she felt it was her duty to raise awareness peacefully but also to disrupt the blind state of white St. Louis. All the demonstrators had bought tickets, Mr. Crane said. Mr. Brown was shot on Aug. 9 by a police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. The guest conductor for the evening, Markus Stenz, watched the protest play out from his podium and then resumed the concert.",2014-10-05T21:51:34+0000

Her Top Shelf interviews give an uncensored account of the beauty routines of everyone from models to fashion moguls and have become something of an obsessive read for many; to date, the site generates 10 million page views per month.

As Weiss explains, there are great products out there, but not a single brand that spoke to me, that I really identified with. So I wanted Glossier to be simple and effective but not too precious. To that end, she developed four basic skin-care items for real life: a face mist, moisturizer, skin tint and multitasking balm, which shes already put into the hands of friends and followers (Karlie Kloss, Garance Dor).",2014-10-06T18:30:44+0000

(Sundance) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this Woody Allen tribute to Italian cinema of the 1950s and 60s, a retired and overly psychoanalyzed music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to a lawyer (Flavio Parenti). Also in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and falls into the arms of a movie star, while her befuddled husband (Alessandro Tiberi) tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penlope Cruz) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) in shreds when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) visits. Alec Baldwin, above left with Mr. Eisenberg, plays the older architect  a ghost? a specter of the younger mans self?  who witnesses the ordeal. One of the most delightful things about To Rome With Love is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The movies limitations, as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights. ",2014-10-07T05:00:04+0000

It is one of the many artfully arranged fruit trees she planted, which include the espalier apple tree, shown in the above photo of Mellon at home in 1982. In fact, she loved fruit trees so much that she used them to anchor the Rose Garden at the White House, which she designed at the Kennedys request. She even wore one as a brooch: circa 1950, Duke Fulco di Verdura designed a 14-karat-gold and platinum brooch to look like the very same espalier apple tree Mellon grew at home. With diamonds for leaves and rubies as apples, the design is estimated to fetch from $2,500 to $3,500 next month at Sothebys, which will host auctions of all of Mellons most beautiful belongings (she passed away this past spring at the age of 103).",2014-10-09T14:00:37+0000

He said he feared that the diamond would have been lost to Germany forever if it had been taken to the United States and perhaps acquired by an American museum.

There, five waiters presented them with a seven-course tasting menu (after the trio of canaps and an amuse-bouche, naturellement). The meal was overseen by the star chef and eponym himself, Daniel Boulud, whose goal was, he says, for the children to really discover a lot of flavor, a lot of layers, a lot of texture. These discoveries included Smoked Paprika Cured Hamachi (the most-foreign thing for them, Boulud says), Crispy Japanese Snapper (which they loved to see) and Wagyu Beef Rib-Eye (a big success). To capture the childrens reactions, the magazine asked Jeffrey Blitz, the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary Spellbound, to make a video. The initiates seemed to enjoy the experience, but that isnt to say they loved all those flavors and textures. At one point, after tasting a custom-made nonalcoholic cocktail, 7-year-old Chester Parish said: This is, like, the only good course. Its yummy.",2014-10-10T14:30:07+0000

Instead, the Finnish minister to Sweden, a diplomatic and economic authority, left for Moscow at the head of a mission. The Finns are solidly united in their determination to remain neutral in the present European struggle and to resist aggression. Two hundred thousand Finnish troops are reported massed on the Soviet frontier. Evacuation of numerous towns and villages along the frontier has been ordered, and voluntary civilian evacuation of the capital, Helsingfors, has been asked.

But its still going strong on the best-seller lists  in 2014 alone, the conflict has appeared on the graphic books list, the hardcover fiction list, the childrens picture books list and the e-books nonfiction list. (One digital best seller, Tim Rowlands Strange and Obscure Stories of the Civil War, features two photo illustrations on the cover: one of a bearded lady with the caption Sarah Emma Edmonds was a complicated girl, the other of a battle scene with the caption Unleashing a maelstrom of fiery hell at a pheasant. I believe I am warming to e-books.) The latest title to join this march is S. C. Gwynnes Rebel Yell: The Violence, Passion, and Redemption of Stonewall Jackson, new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Gwynne  who spent more than a year on the paperback list with his previous book, Empire of the Summer Moon, about the Comanche chief Quanah Parker  told The Austin American-Statesman he was especially interested in how Thomas Jackson went, in 14 months, from being an eccentric and unsuccessful college professor to leading the Rebel forces in the Shenandoah Valley campaign. What fascinates me about Jackson is the idea of transformation, he said. He became the most famous man of the war. Gwynne knows something about personal transformation. In the early 1980s he was working as a banker and dreaming of a writing career when his wife went on the game show Tic-Tac-Dough and won $60,000. That money lasted for years, he told The American-Statesman. So I quit banking.",2014-10-10T16:35:34+0000

Moreover, a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. If womens literature were to have a future, she continues, there is a great part which must be played in that future . . . by physical conditions. The book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that womens books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men, and framed so that they do not need long hours of steady and uninterrupted work.

Dr. Martin Luther King, the 35-year-old American Negro leader, today [Oct. 14] was awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his consistent support of the principle of nonviolence in the Negro campaign for civil rights. He said he would use the 273,000 Swedish crowns prize (about $53,000) to strengthen the civil rights campaign in the United States. Dr. King is the 12th American to receive the prize. He is the second Negro leader to win in four years. The 1960 award was given to Albert Luthuli, of South Africa. A third Negro, Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, of the United States, was the 1950 winner. Dr. King, whose fight against racial discrimination has brought him many jail terms, will receive the prize at Oslo University on Dec. 10. I do not consider this merely an honor to me personally, but a tribute to the discipline, wise restraint and majestic courage of the millions of gallant Negro and white persons of good will who have followed a nonviolent course in seeking to establish a reign of justice and a rule of love across this nation of ours, he said. Dr. King was selected from a list proposed by former Peace Prize winners, members of governments and parliaments around the world and other dignitaries.

He and his partner, Michel Hurst, longtime midcentury-furniture dealers, soon learned that these were the men of Casa Susanna, a weekend safe haven in the Catskills for early 60s cross-dressers. Mr. Swope and Mr. Hurst collected 120 of the photos into a book, published in 2005 by Powerhouse and now in its third printing. The photos even inspired a Broadway play, Casa Valentina, by Harvey Fierstein, which opened last spring. Now, Mr. Hurst and Mr. Swope are selling all 340 images at auction at Wright in Chicago on Oct. 30, hoping an institution will buy them for public display. Theres a special magic seeing the pictures in person, Mr. Swope said.

Just down the street from a Greyhound station in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles, the Springs, a new 13,500 square-foot holistic wellness center opening this weekend, is a beacon of change in the form of an organic juice bar and cafe plus yoga studio and spa with infrared saunas, jade-stone therapy and an in-house horticulturalist, who will come every week to sing to the fig trees and palms. We figured that people who like one will also be interested in the other, says the Springs co-founder Jared Stein of the decision to offer both dining and wellness services. (As an opening offer, a yoga class comes free with the purchase of a cold-pressed juice.)

Its her fourth book to become a best seller, which is both heartening and a little weird  heartening because Robinsons sentences are so polished and faceted and clear they could bend light; weird because most of her books engage deeply with the thornier aspects of Calvinist theology. (She really is not like any other writer, Cathleen Schine wrote, approvingly, in The New York Review of Books recently. She really isnt.) Robinson first made the list in 2005 with her second novel, Gilead, which went on to win the Pulitzer and spent three months on the hardcover and paperback lists. It also laid the groundwork for both of her subsequent novels, which revisit the same characters and small-town setting. Robinson was as surprised as anyone when Gilead found a wide popular audience. If you were to say to someone that you were to write a book about a minister dying in Iowa in 1956 and that he would spend a certain time on theological reflections, they would not think this was a book that would necessarily . . . sell, she conceded to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005.

Next, we look at a pair of celebrities on different ends of the career spectrum: the newly minted megastar actor Channing Tatum, who makes time in his busy schedule to indulge his secret passion, sculpture; and the rock icon Stevie Nicks, who doles out wisdom (and some moon pendants) to the rising girl band Haim at her home in Los Angeles. And in two of our most ambitious stories of the past decade, we worked with 15 renowned artists and 15 famous authors. We asked the artists (Barbara Kruger, Francesco Vezzoli and others) to get creative in the form of self-promotional advertisements, and the authors (Zadie Smith, James Patterson and others) to pool their talents for a collaborative original story. Elsewhere, Richard Rodriguez pens an essay on what it means to be naked in the digital age; Tim Wu investigates the roots of modern-day mindfulness practices in California wine country; and Gideon Lewis-Kraus travels to the remote Italian island of Stromboli to check out one of arts oddest  and most volcanic  residencies.

us,Whats On TV Sunday,"7 P.M. (Syfy) BIRTH (2004) Anna, a young widow played by Nicole Kidman, above, becomes convinced that Sean (Cameron Bright) is the reincarnation of her husband. The trouble is, Sean is only 10. Lauren Bacall plays Annas mother in this mystery from Jonathan Glazer; Danny Huston is her frustrated fianc, and Anne Heche is the sister-in-law with secrets. The films delicate mood of indeterminacy rests on his shoulders, or rather in his smooth, inscrutable face, A. O. Scott wrote of Mr. Bright in The New York Times. His character represents a premise that is absurd, even ridiculous, but for Birth to work, it must be addressed with utter seriousness, even solemnity. And somehow, in Mr. Glazers hands, it does work. The hushed, claustrophobic ambience of high privilege and repressed feeling occasionally cracks, as this horror movie reveals itself also to be a rich, agonizing melodrama and a dry comedy of manners set in a fantasy Manhattan of crme caramel wainscoting and black-tie evenings at the opera. Of Ms. Kidman, he added, she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.

The airborne sequences are particularly compelling, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. When Hiccup first climbs on Toothlesss back and urges the dragon to take wing, the hearts of the audience soar with a primitive and durable delight, he said. The techniques that enabled this feeling may be dauntingly complicated, but the feeling could not be simpler. At the beginning and the end, How to Train Your Dragon is noisy and action-packed in the usual way, Mr. Scott added, with eye-straining, ear-popping large-scale effects.

It is hoped that Great Britain will be able to make good her case for the seizure. The right of Great Britain to insist that ships acquired by Americans be used strictly in neutral trade, and not to help late owners, is regarded as undoubted. The Brindillo is a German oil-tank steamer, now flying the American flag. She was captured by the cruiser Suffolk and taken into Halifax, N.S., by the armed cruiser Caronia.

In an interview with Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker, posted online on Monday, he said same-sex marriage should be a right for all Americans regardless of where they lived. But he added that given the direction of society, for the court to have allowed the process to play out the way it has may make the shift less controversial and more lasting. The court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last year and, in a separate ruling, effectively allowed same-sex marriage to proceed in California.",2014-10-21T03:00:21+0000

(FX) ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER (2012) In this adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smiths comic novel, Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) wages war,  la Buffy, on a vampire army of white Southerners whose cause is the enslavement of humans and not states rights. Anthony Mackie (above, with Mr. Walker) plays Will, the friend whom Lincoln saved as a child from the whip of a slaver (Marton Csokas), who took his revenge by killing Lincolns mother. His father died soon after. Dominic Cooper is Henry Sturges, the enigma who taught the orphaned Abe the Way of the Vampire Kill. Outside of Nazis and zombies or, better yet, Nazi zombies, nothing says easily disposable villains like slave-trading vampires, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov. And there is, no question, something satisfying  as the pleasure of the storys pop conceit hits your deep historical outrage  about watching Lincoln decapitate a slave-trading ghoul, at least the first few dozen times. If only Mr. Bekmambetov had a strong sense of narrative rhythm and proportion, and as great a commitment to life as he does to death and all the ways bodies can be digitally pulverized.

Samuel, who died in 1996 at the age of 92, began commissioning furniture and objects in the late 1960s from artists like Csar, Guy de Rougemont and Philippe Hiquily, who used materials such as brass and smoked Plexiglas to create a blend of sculpture and furniture. Until then, he had flirted with the art world  he was close to Balthus, with whom he traded sofas for paintings  but never to such an extent. De Rougemonts Nuage table, for instance, and Hiquilys beaten brass chairs, had the shocking effect of real modernism.

Yet somehow as a Brandeis sophomore I had made my way to be a finalist for the Washington Post internship. It must have been my essay. And there I was sitting at Ben Bradlees right hand in a Boston restaurant surrounded by other finalists, all of whom went to Harvard, were working on The Crimson, and had dazzling credentials. By the time lunch was over, I was sure I was no longer in the running. But as I got up to leave, Ben placed his hand on my arm and asked me if I had a few minutes to talk. A half-hour passed. He asked me what I thought of the Vietnam War. I remember telling him I was torn. He seemed pleased by my confusion. We talked about writing. I honestly dont remember what else we talked about except that when we parted I knew what I wanted to do  I wanted to work for him.

In a report on its website, the organization attributed the spread to a 42-year-old Turkish citizen who had been working in the Saudi city of Jidda; he fell ill there last month and flew two weeks ago to the Turkish city of Hatay, where he was hospitalized and died within days. The organization said medical investigators confirmed that the man had suffered from MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and they were checking others in Turkey and Saudi Arabia who had been in contact with him during his symptomatic phase. Saudi Arabia has been under enormous pressure to control the disease, which can incubate in camels and other livestock. The Saudi authorities have been faulted for having allowed MERS to proliferate, particularly in Jidda, Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and the holy city of Mecca, where pilgrims from the entire world converge for the annual hajj. Pilgrims are known to have spread the disease to Iran, Jordan and Algeria. The W.H.O. said that as of Friday, it had tallied 883 MERS cases worldwide, including at least 319 deaths.

us,Bill Cunningham | Paying Respects,"Is there an appropriate code of dress for memorial services today? On Saturday, Oct. 18, a group of very elegant people entered St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue. It turned out to be a memorial service for Eileen Ford, a founder of the modeling agency named for her, who died in July. The spectacle of the nearly 500 decorously dressed people at the memorial service was in sharp contrast to the mixed-up looks of todays fashion, even at funerals. For some, a dash of mauve, red or white on black, or a spectrum of grays was an appropriate approach. The clothes reflected what Mrs. Ford brought to the industry, which was a sense of decorum. On Monday, farther up Fifth Avenue, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a preview of its elegant small exhibition Death Becomes Her: A Century of Mourning Attire, with all the rigid rules of 19th-century mourning dress. And after the announcement of Oscar de la Rentas death Monday evening, at benefit dinners during the week some women wore their own Oscars in honor of the designer, bottom center. While the late 20th century threw most of the rules out the window, black remains dominant. One casualty of changes in funeral style was the hat, once required.",2014-10-25T00:09:37+0000

(HBO Signature) THE CONJURING (2013) Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life paranormal investigators who declared an infamous Dutch colonial-style house on Long Island haunted, leading to the many Amityville movies. Their target this time is a Rhode Island farmhouse, where the blissful dreams of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Tayor and Ron Livingston, above, with Mr. Wilson, right) and their five daughters become a moaning, creaking nightmare when they find themselves playing cat-and-mouse with an evil force. The director, James Wan, smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. That gives the movie a shiver of political currency, even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, theyre facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that arent much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker.

(MoreMax) NON-STOP (2014) An air marshal (Liam Neeson), consumed by heartache and a complicated past, tries to outwit a villain on a flight from New York to London who has vowed to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account. In this thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, Lupita Nyongo, Linus Roache and Shea Whigham add to the suspense in their roles as prospective heroes or villains. And while the movie doesnt always make sense, thats incidental to the pleasures of a slow-season Liam Neeson release as diverting as this one, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. A lot has been written about Mr. Neesons surprising resurrection as an older action hero, which has sometimes been more rewarding theoretically than cinematically. Mr. Collet-Serra, however, makes good on that promise with a sure genre hand and real feeling for what Mr. Neeson brings to the screen at this stage of his career, including beauty etched by time and a still-imposing body that moves with the heaviness and grandeur of an old warrior raising his sword one last time.

Sharon, who is 35, leads the Industry, which in its four years as an experimental opera company has staged productions that move opera away from the fixed experience of proceedings. In fact, he says, his projects are actively immersive and participatory  your experience is prioritized. That might sound like buzzy lip service in a post-Sleep No More performance landscape, but the Industrys bona fides back up its ambitious mission statement. The company, which is based in Los Angeles (a city that has always been a frontier for new explorations, Sharon notes), has commissioned and produced three operas to date, all of which have been site-specific enterprises that reimagine the roles of both the performers and the audience. Invisible Cities, based on Italo Calvinos postmodern book of the same name, has received the most acclaim; its composer, Christopher Cerrone, was a finalist for a 2014 Pulitzer Prize.",2014-10-29T20:30:14+0000

After Hurricane Sandy hit, Bettany never saw them again. Im not a religious man, but I grew up a Catholic, and my father always used to say to me, There but for the grace of God go I,' Bettany says. He was keen to explore the disparity between that sense of empathy and what he sees as todays dismissive view of homelessness. Now theres this sort of slightly aggressive response, he says. This idea that you must have done something to bring yourself this low, and youre responsible for it. In their research for Shelter, Bettany and his wife, Jennifer Connelly, who stars in the film, became involved with the organization Coalition for the Homeless; tomorrow they will be honored at its annual ArtWalkgala, hosted by Dolce & Gabbana, at which works from such artists as Cindy Sherman, Chuck Close and Louise Bourgeois will be auctioned off.

Earlier this month, a Twitter post from the account of a woman in the St. Louis area claimed to have information from a person on the grand jury in the case. Later the woman said that her account was hacked and that she was not responsible for the message. On Thursday, Mr. McCulloch supported her account, saying that an investigation revealed that the account had, indeed, been hacked and the origin/author of the tweet is unknown. He added that the owner of the account has no connection with any member of the grand jury. The original post claimed that a grand juror said that there was not yet enough evidence given to the jury to justify charging Officer Wilson with a crime. ",2014-10-31T00:24:12+0000

Larsons The Return of George Washington: 1783-1789,"If the American Revolution has been remembered like a five-act play, the years after the war are the tension-filled fourth, so suspenseful as to border on melodrama. Even the heroes seem almost hysterical. John Quincy Adams, 20 years old in 1787, deemed it the critical period even before its conclusion. The new states went their own democratic ways in dealing with a credit crisis and left the Continental Congress unable to pay its debts. A high point of revolutionary radicalism, it was a low point for what Adams called the bonds of union. ",2014-10-31T16:00:12+0000

This conjunction is interesting because, in the official telling of modern sciences origins, Aristotle is hardly regarded as heroic. Instead hes portrayed as the obstacle over which the early heroes of the scientific revolution  Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo  had to leap in order to impose a genuinely explanatory methodology over the often deceptive input of sense perception. After all, what could be clearer to the senses than that the Earth is stationary and the heavens revolve around it? If there was any ancient whom these pioneers of modern science esteemed it was Plato. He, too, had emphasized the deceptiveness of appearances. Whats more he had suggested, however obliquely, most especially in his Timaeus, that mathematics reveals the true structure of the cosmos, offering us the means by which we can distinguish between reliable and unreliable appearances. So, at least, did men like Galileo read the Timaeus, finding insights there to topple the formidable edifice of a Church-fortified Aristotelianism. The new scientists discarded at least two of the four Aristotelian causes, the formal and the final, the latter having injected a pernicious teleology into all physical explanations. (Flames leap and rocks fall because their constituent elements are striving to get to their right places.) In place of Aristotles qualitative categories, the new scientists put quantitative descriptions of matter in motion. What Aristotle had sundered, the celestial and the terrestrial, were united under one mechanics. And the rest, as they say, is history.",2014-10-31T16:00:25+0000

The case that I talk about was out of Monroeville, Ala., he said. Monroeville is the community where Harper Lee grew up and wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. And if you go to people there, they love that story. And they love celebrating that story. But we have an innocent African-American man being sent to death row for a crime he didnt commit, and theres no consciousness about that. . . . One of the most powerful things for me in this book was trying to get people to appreciate that we have a criminal justice system that treats you better if youre rich and guilty than if youre poor and innocent. Im not trying to beat up on people who are wealthy, but I want us to understand if were really committed to justice, weve got to do better for the poor than were doing.

The Rohilla had on board a staff of doctors and nurses who had just set out on their errand of mercy, together with a large crew. The seas were so heavy that the ships boats were smashed immediately after being lowered. Some persons aboard were rescued by lifeboats but eighty are still on the wreck, according to the latest news received to-day, enormous seas preventing their rescue. Several bodies have been washed ashore. A telegram received early this morning says: The Whitby boat is disabled and the Scarborough lifeboat, in tow of a tug, is unable to approach sufficiently near to effect a rescue. Now late at night the middle of the vessel is the only portion remaining, the stem and stern having both parted. Those crowded in the dismembered portion appear to be doomed, for, so far as can be seen, no human aid can be extended to them.

Its bare-bones hip-hop, full of charismatic menace, street anxiety and just the faintest dash of Caribbean flair.",2014-10-31T22:41:47+0000
us,"Meet the Butter Butt, One Tough Bird","Weighing only a few ounces, warblers are not known for their winter hardiness, but the yellow-rumped, or myrtle, warbler is one tough bird. As warblers go, this species is just a little larger, a little heavier and a little bulkier than its kin. They can be downright abundant in the late fall landscape, darting through the thinning tree branches, or even shaking off the seasons first snowflakes. The yellow-rumped warbler (Setophaga coronata) overwinters farther north than any other North American wood warbler, and is very hardy. Butter butts, as birders call them because of the bright yellow patch above their tails, are just beginning to show up in our local woodlands as their passerine brethren abandon the cold Northeast for the warmth of Central and South America. The birds are official New Yorkers throughout the winter months.",2014-10-31T22:51:05+0000

Even in a season so full of excellent dancers as this New York autumn has been, its a tonic to watch the Richard Alston Dance Company, the British troupe appearing through Sunday at Montclair State University. I love the detailed articulation of the dancers spines and torsos. (You see very clearly when a movement is initiated from deep in the waist or when it is nearer the shoulders.) And I love the quickness of their feet (propelling them so swiftly into jumps that you see the arrival in the air without noticing the takeoff, or bouncing them through rapid hops across the floor).",2014-10-31T23:24:35+0000
