us,"'Act of Aggression,' French Film, Opens","NO, ""The Actors's Revenge"" isn't about the murder of a drama critic. That might have been more interesting. It is an artistically arranged but extremely rambling exercise full of melodramic bumps and lumps, as a vengeful actor destroys three men who ruined his family years ago.The hitch, of course, is a pretty face, that of a pure-hearted daughter, caught up in the murderous coils. And Ayako Wakao is a beaut.It is the exquisite face of this girl and some artful color dcor that are the main interests. For the general effect of the story, obviously intended as an old-time tale of traditional gravity, is splintery stuff and often confusing. And Kon Ichikawa's direction is a curious mixture of stylish artifice and plain bombast.The strangest thing of all, perhaps, for a story of Old Japan is the subtly, sleeky Occidental musical score, slipping into cool and torchy jazz at the oddest moments. The acting is pretty good, with traditional grunts and growls held to a minimum.Even so, it's hard to fathom the supposed charisma of the wily hero, Kazuo Hasegawa, who easily magnetizes his victims. As a Kabuki female impersonator, he's also at it offstage, mincing and mewing with some abrupt, lightning sword work. Yes, there's plenty of chopping. But this time the sound and fury signify only so-so dividends out front, at least here.""The Actor's Revenge"" (""The Revenge of Ukeno-Jo"") was shown at the 1971 Bijou Cinema's festival of Japanese imports.

He laughs often and easily and possesses what W. B. Yeats called the terrible gift of intimacy, which means that you find yourself talking to him almost immediately as if you and he had known each other for years. But unlike most possessors of this gift, he is generous with himself and speaks freely of his personal concerns and hesitations. For a man whose art, like Strindberg's, has often been an instrument of despair, he seems astonishingly open and at ease in himself. He has only one nervous tic: As he talks, he turns in his hand a chunk of wood, darkened and grainy from much handling. Years ago, he gave up smoking, after severe nicotine poisoning.

She observed that her fruit trees were less fruitful, her mums have not yet bloomed and the flowers near the lights were sparse. She wondered if the lights were affecting her garden plants. Neal R. Tempel, writes from the biology department of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, L.I. that lights do indeed alter the plant's photoperiod mechanism and the problem is becoming more common since the new installations of the sodium vapor lamps. He enclosed an article from the New York State Environment describing U.S. Department of Agriculture Research on high pressure sodium lamps. The researchers have found that although these lamps are twice as efficient as mercury lamps, they emit more yellow and red light. The red part of the spectrum is the growth triggering light which affects flowering, branching, dormancy and other growth responses. The researchers recommended using the sodium vapor lamps only on streets or highways for safety where light tolerant plants can be grown. Metal hallide lamps, though less efficient, are preferred in malls and parks where there are dense plantings.",1975-12-07T05:00:00+0000

In its heyday the fortified city was a major port for Spanish galleons carrying gold and goods from the New World to Spain and it successfully repulsed attacks by Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins. In 1598, however the Earl of Cumberland breached the land wall of El Morro and took San Juan. To make the city impregnable from the land side, the Spanish in the 18th century built the intricate 27acre complex of San Cristobal about half a mile from El Morro. Unlike the olderfortress with its single compact unit of five levels, San Cristobal was built with five independent outworks, or small forts, in front of the main fort, all six units connected by tunnels or moats.

Everybody has heard of Jewish businessmen, lawyers, doctors and even, unfortunately, nursing home owners.

On the basis of everything he's done since, that acclaim seems to have been unwarranted.Mr. Cayatte's newest film to be released in this country, ""Where There's Smoke,"" virtually defines the pedestrian movie. It proceeds earnestly, step by step, from one obvious point to another, like a man walking around a golf course without clubs, just for the exercise.""Where There's. Smoke"" (II-n'y-a pas de Fume Sans Feu), which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, is about political corruption in a rich Paris suburb where to be mayor, apparently, offers such magnificent rewards (whether it's power, money or simply girls, the film never says) that the incumbent party resorts to bribery, blackmail and murder to stay in office.Though Mr. Cayatte was once a lawyer, he doesn't acknowledge that there may be two sides to any question or that characters, like motives, may be mixed. ""Where There's Smoke"" is the story of the mostly successful efforts of the incumbent mayor to discredit his principal opposition, a clean-living young doctor (Bernard Fresson), by circulating a fake photograph showing the doctor's brave, loyal wife (Annie Girardot) participating in an orgy, which, if you've seen an Annie Girardot movie lately, is the last thing she would do.The film in fact is less about political corruption and the lust for power than the technology of blackmail. The only sequence of interest in the movie shows how it's possible to fake a photograph, to place one person's head on the body of another, in such a way that even laser beams cannot detect the deception.This may give you pause, if not quite making you stop and think.",1975-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Adroit 'Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother',"""Unless I'm very much mistaken,"" says Sigerson Holmes (Gene Wilder), drawing the words out with care and smiling slightly, preparing to stun his audience with a grand new insight, ""'hadderd' is the Egyptian word 'to eat fat.'""Sigerson is deciphering a coded message that has just been delivered to his tacky London flat in ""The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" and, of course, he's immediately off on the wrong track.""The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother,"" which opened at two theaters here yesterday, is a charming slapstick comedy that honors Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original creation as much by what it doesn't do as by what it does do. The film is a marvelously lowbrow caper but it makes no attempt to parody the great Sherlock himself, who is treated with cheerful if distant awe and respect, measured entirely in terms of Sigerson's ineptitude.Sigerson Holmes, somewhat manic, capable of fits of intense, wrongheaded concentration, is the unique creation of Gene Wilder, who not only stars in the film but who also wrote and directed it.It's correct to report that Sigerson is younger than his brother Sherlock (younger also than their brother, Mycroft, who does not appear in this adventure). He's also luckier and much, much blonder, but he is just a teeny-tiny bit dense, which is something he can never admit in his sibling fury.Sigerson loathes Sherlock with a depth that is reserved only for the loathing that one brother cherishes for another. Yet that doesn't prevent Sigerson from hanging a shingle outside his door that reads ""S. Holmes, Consulting Investigator,"" which occasionally catches a client who had intended to hire Sherlock.Like ""Young Frankenstein,"" the script for which was written by Mr. Wilder and Mel Brooks, ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" is full of affection and generous feelings for the genre it's having fun with. It never mistakes the conventions of the Sherlock Holmes world for jokes in themselves. It's not Victorian London nor Conan Doyle conceits that are funny. The humor is in the spectacle of Sigerson's solemnly demonstrating his inability to do absolutely anything right.Always just offscreen, and sometimes briefly on, is the imposing presence of older brother Sherlock (played with nice style by Douglas Wilmer), who is the architect of the plot that Sigerson thinks he is solving by himself with some help from his equivalent of Dr. Watson. This character is a retired London detective named Orville Sacker who, as played by Marty Feldman, is just the Dr. Watson that Sigerson deservesoptimistic, wise-talking, obsequious and incurably nuts.Mr. Wilder has surrounded himself with great comic actors and gives them all the opportunity to perform, especially Madeline Kahn, who may possibly be the funniest woman in films today. Miss Kahn plays Jenny Hill, who introduces herself as an actress (""I am simultaneously funny and sad""), but whose identities change from time to time, as befits a mystery.In addition there are Leo McKern, as Professor Moriarty, still a ruthless villain but who, in Mr. Wilder's screenplay, doesn't know what to do with the decimal point in long division; Dom DeLuise, as a crazy Italian opera star with a misguided desire to succeed in espionage, and John Le Mesurier, as an aging British foreign secretary who has a letch for pretty nannies.The film has a PG rating becauseI supposeof a few sexy gags of the kind that will go over the heads of the very young and will certainly not impair the morals of the kids who will understand them. ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother"" seems to be composed mainly of jokes that will delight the young while effectively recalling for the rest of us how hilarious it was to see a man lose his pants at a stuffy dinner party or the shambles that can be made of grand opera when the wrong people get on the stage.Mr. Wilder, always a fine, very straight comic actor, here makes an impressive debut as a comedy director.",1975-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Partly, I think, he faded away when Americans could no longer identify themselves with the kindly, simplehearted uncle. But Sam's demise was undoubtedly insured by limitations of ethnic origin and gender. He could never be anything but a white AngloSaxon male. As a symbol of America he was already a quaint anachronism before women's liberation went to work on male authority.

us,Connery and Caine Flee Kipling India,"The setting is India in the late 19th century when the British raj was in his glory. It is a time of mission and mystery and the white man's burden, of appalling poverty and of wealth often described as untold. The cities teem with unruly humanity, with beggars, blind men, snake charmers, demented holy men, starving children. In the upland territories British soldiers guard the frontiers to places of which someone will say, quite seriously, ""No white man has ever gone in there and come out alive.""In marvelous old movies like ""Lives of the Bengal Lancers"" and ""Gunga Din,"" this world is very far removed and terribly romantic, as it still is in John Huston's highly entertaining new film, ""The Man Who Would Be King,"" based on the short story by Rudyard Kipling. The film opened yesterday at two theaters.The most pleasant surprise about ""The Man Who Would Be King"" is that although it is about as romantic and implausible an adventure as you're likely to see, it's not an anachronism. It's neither a silly update of an entertainment designed for pre-World War II Saturday-afternoon America, nor is it one of those films that are wise with hindsight about earlier eras, like John Milius's ""The Wind and the Lion.""""The Man Who Would Be King"" manages to be great fun in itself while being most faithful to Kipling, whose story, written in the 1890's, is a kind of raffish metaphor for the British colonial experience that did not end for another half century. But this really isn't what ""The Man Who Would Be King"" is about. It's a tall tale, a legend, of steadfastness, courage, camaraderie, gallantry and greed, though not necessarily in that order.It's about two former English soldiers turned con artists, Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine), who decide that Victoria's India is no longer big enough for them (and their growing reputations as blackmailers and forgers). They decide to carve out their own kingdom in Kafiristan, now a part of Afghanistan but then an undiscovered territory not visited by a known tourist or king since Alexander the Great.Danny and Peachy are grand, old-fashioned adventurers with the gift of gab and a sense of style. Outrageously disguised as a holy man and his servant, they climb mountains and cross glaciers to penetrate the forbidden territory where, through luck and a series of coincidences, they realize their wildest dreams.Danny gets himself crowned king and recognized as a god, the legitimate son of Alexander, and Peachy becomes chief of the armed forces and the treasure chamber. But while Peachy keeps his eye on the main chance, that is, an opportunity to abscond with the gold, Danny begins to like the divinity business and to take his responsibilities seriously, which is their downfall.Not in a very long while has Mr. Huston, who wrote the screenplay with Gladys Hill and also directed the film, been so successfully lighthearted and so consistently in command of his subject. Small-time frauds who get in over their heads have always appealed to him, and Danny and Peachy, as played by Mr. Connery and Mr. Caine, are two of his nicest discoveries  larger-than-life, robust, sometimes curiously prim but suddenly stalwart in the crises.Christopher Plummer also gives the film weight in the role of the young Rudyard Kipling who, as a newspaperman in India, participates in the beginning and the end of the story. Supporting the stars are Saeed Jaffrey, as a sort of glib Gunga Din character, who always begins a tale of woe by saying ""oh me, by jove, alas,"" as if it were one word, and Shakira Caine (Mrs. Michael Caine), who plays an exotic heathen beauty.The movie, which was shot in Morocco, looks lovely and remote (how did we ever once settle for those black-and-white Hollywood hills?) and has just enough romantic nonsense in it to enchant the child in each of us.",1975-12-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Killer Elite,' or Copping Out of the Universal Sell-Out","Sam Peckinpah knows how to make movies but perhaps he has forgotten why. At least that is the feeling given by this bag of mixed, often damp fireworks about the alienation of people who do dirty tricks for the Central Intelligence Agency and discover that the tricks as well as the dirt are on them.""The Killer Elite,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, resembles ""Three Days of the Condor"" so closely that it is as if Mr. Peckinpah had deliberately set himself to do flashier variations on the same theme.The theme is the world as universal sell-out. The metaphor is a covert intelligence organization that does malignant things ostensibly in a good cause. The protagonist is an individual who unwittingly falls afoul of one of the organization's plans, becomes its target and ultimately, after all kinds of mayhem, discovers its ends are as amoral as its methods, and walks out.James Caan plays the role Robert Redford had in ""Three Days."" Since he is a better actor than Mr. Redfordsharper, more urgenthe is more convincing. Since Mr. Peckinpah is more talented than Sidney Pollack, who did ""Three Days,"" his film has moments, at least, of greater brilliance.Both pictures operate on the premise that the audience has brought along its eyes but left its head at home. Both are relentlessly far-fetched, presenting all the conceivable outrageousness of the clandestine world at the maximum, and without restaint. A work of art can't be credible when it makes everything happen that can happen.Mr. Peckinpah is mannered and inventive, and these qualities both give the film its strengths and undermine it horrendously. Cleverness, for one thing, gets in the way of comprehensibility. The plot revolves around the efforts of a fanatical group of Japanese terrorists to kill an anti-Communist Chinese leader.The attempt at the airport, with a spectacular slow-motion depiction of assassination by kungfu, is intercut with an indoor scene where the motives for all this are explained. The result is that the subsequent action is very hard to follow and it takes a long time to figure out which group of Orientals stands for what.There is a confrontation scene between the leader of the clandestine group and his main assistant, who is working for the other side. The two men glower but don't confront: they talk about the stock market, instead. Perhaps this is stylish, but it is hopelessly obscure, and the film, which lasts 123 minutes, has already been going on for about 100.On the other hand, Mr. Peckinpah uses his inventiveness to good purpose in the early part of the film. The protagonist has been grievously wounded by a fellow member of his organization. He sets himself to recover so he can avenge himself; his superiors vaguely discourage him.In his painful hospital recoverydone with some of the director's bent for sadistic directnesseach exercise, each effort to walk becomes another stage in the hero's progressive alienation from his organization.There is a fine scene at the end where the anticommunist leader is being taken by sailboat to presumed safety on a line of mothballed Navy ships. The dead warships, in a massive gray line, wait: a stunning image of entrapment.The climactic battle scene, aboard the warships, is ridiculously operatic, however. If a brief use of slow motion in the airport scene was effective, here it goes on endlessly. The notion of the various clandestine operatives standing around while the Chinese leader and his enemies fight things out with sabers is absurb; what is worse, the sight of it is absurd.If there ever was a screenplaythe credits claim that there waseither it was feeble to begin with, or Mr. Peckinpah has gone galloping all over the lot with it. This director thinks he can do anything he wants, and he is nearly right: But he is a long way from his audience.",1975-12-18T05:00:00+0000

us,'Adventures of the Wilderness Family',"Togetherness should be synonomous with the holiday season, and ""The Adventures of the Wilderness Family,"" which arrived at the Guild and Embassy Theaters yesterday is charmingly appropriate for the family and the season. Perhaps only curmudgeons over the age of 8 would find it unlikely that a black bear would take on a silent grizzly or that a devoted dog would hold off an entire wolfpack in defense of this family. But it's an ideally wholesome clan, and both wilderness and fauna are photogenic and endearing.The family's season in the wilds, a program note indicates, stems from a true story of escape from illness, smog and other traumas of Los Angeles to the pioneer life in the lake-studded, forest high country of the Pacific Northwest. In this case, the youthful father and mother and their little boy and girl take to their new, gorgeously rugged terrain like Sioux. And before you can say Swiss Family Robinson, they've erected their own log cabin and collected a raccoon, a pair of cuddly, motherless bear cubs and a variety of problems.Stewart Raffill, who directed from his own script, is a man to let the beauties of nature overwhelm him. Action is the key here. The children for example, innocently pick up a couple of cougar cubs, and so daddy and the family hound have to fight off the enraged mother. And, there's a rockslide and the little girl's sudden fever, which sends daddy down the rapids in search of a doctor. Also that wolfpack attack and that unfriendly grizzly.Robert F. Logan and Susan Damante Shaw are fairly restrained, natural and attractive as the pioneering parents, as are Holly Holmes and Ham Larsen, as their wide-eyed, loving youngsters. And, if they often seem to be minuscule figures against the striking uninhabited, wildlife-filled background of Utah's Uinta Mountains where the adventures were filmed, they do add appreciative bits.",1975-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: What's Up, Doc?","""Bugs Bunny Superstar,"" which opened yesterday at the Regency and D. W. Griffith Theaters, is a 90-minute anthology film composed of 10 Warner Brothers cartoons produced between 1940 and 1948. Seven of the 10 star the pushy, incredibly self-assured rabbit whose voice, supplied by the great Mel Blanc, is as much a part of Bugs Bunny's public persona as his physique, which really isn't that much different from other rabbits you may have known.Three ace Warner Brothers animation directors  Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Fritz Freleng  come on the screen, none too briefly, to talk about how great it was in the old days on the Warner lot when it was just one big happy family. Orson Welles bridges the gaps with facetious narration that sounds as if it had been left on someone's Phone-Mate.That's the bad news.The good news is that Bugs and several of the other creations of Warner cartoonists are enduringly comic characters, as ebullient as any that the Disney organization created and always much more irreverent. This program includes two classics, ""The Corny Concerto"" (1943), a wickedly funny send-up of Disney's ""Fantasia,"" and ""Rhapsody Rabbit"" (1945), in which Bugs and a mouse compete to see who can get through Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies first, with the least amount of piano left.Of the other characters, my particular favorite is Henery Hawk, a young, intensely serious chicken hawk, who, in ""Walky Talky Hawky,"" goes out to bag his first chicken under the near-fatal misunderstanding that dogs are chickens. Also on the program is another. Warner classic, ""I Taw a Putty Tat"" (1948), in which Tweety Bird, the small yellow, peculiarly nude-looking canary, matches wits with Sylvester, the big, ragged, short-tempered cat who sounds like the late Bert Lahr.Children, brought up on TV, should be dazzled by the slam-bang wit and the excellence of the animation techniques.",1975-12-20T05:00:00+0000

It is astonishing to see how many and how able are the successors of Pound. Curiously, our translators of Chinese poetry must now outnumber the 16thcentury translators of the Bible. While we can scarcely expect translations from Chinese to affect our world so profoundly as Tyndale and his followers affected Reformation England, it is nevertheless hard to doubt that the discovery of Chinese verse is one of the causes, as well as results, of our modern literary sensibility.

Time was, some swear, when even the deities forsook the peaks, retreating to Beacon Hill with the Boston Symphony at the end of its summer season at Tanglewood and abandoning the Berkshire woodlands to the woodcutters and hunters. In his popular painting, Christmas in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, 1967, Norman Rockwell depicted his fellow villagers in a lively holiday scene along his hometown's Main Street, but his brush correctly left the Red Lion Inn, the thoroughfare's dominant structure, dark and empty. The painting, which hangs in the town's Old Corner House, has since become a tourist attraction, and Jane Fitzpatrick, the Red Lion's new owner, is quick to set the record straight by informing visitors that the innthese days remains open at Christmas and will be lit up like a Yule tree during the holidays, as indeed will most of the Berkshires.

us,"'Distance,' Sensitive Film Story of a Black","Sometimes ""Distance"" is awkward and sometimes it is misconceived, but it had a central virtue lacking in a number of more elaborate andto use a horrible wordcinematic films around.It wants to be made. It believes in itself, in its story, in its characters; and that belief pulls viewers into it. Sometimes they are pulled too hard, or in a certain embarrassment because the sequence is obvious or excessive or telegraphed in advance.But self-belief is an arousing quality, especially at a time when an extreme of baroque weariness gives movies such as ""Three Days of the Condor"" or Sam Peckinpah's ""Killer Elite"" the hopeless feeling that they are meant for an empty theater.""Distance,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is set in a Georgia Army post in the mid-1950's. Its protagonist is Sergeant Horne, a black man whose natural force and ability have gone into building himself a shelter against the humiliations of being a Southern black of his time.The Army gives Horne a place where his energy and intelligence can be channeled and protected. Not fulfilled, though: here the haven becomes the prison. He is too good for his job, too much a perfectionist, and he is held to the company of men to whom he knows he is superior. One of the film's many inspired touches is a scene where Horne drinks beer with his fellow-sergeants  easygoing, cynical white men. They drink from cans; he drinks from a glass.The rigidity that is Horne's protection makes him a firstrate master sergeant, but it has made a torment of his private life. He has brought over a German wife, played gracefully and touchingly by Eija Pokkinen. He loves her or has loved herthe failure of the film quite to define their relationship is a weaknessbut he has gradually closed himself to her.Her blond beauty, her gentleness and devotion are a lure and a goad. He needs to hurt her and be hurt by her. He burns like Othello, his fixation on his wife encompassing everything except the ability to see her as she is. He is his own lago; he devises his own jealousies. There is no Cassio except for a young white recruit who has the most casual brush with Mrs. Horne. The ending is tragic, predictably, and almost predictable.In fact, the tragic main plot is too pat and stagy, but it does have a use. It provides a gravely moving current that allows the film's real jewelsits freshness, its lovely characterizations, its splendid actingto be set in something other than their own self-consciousness.Perhaps the best part of the film is the subplot. The white recruit, a bright, languid young man played by James Woods, has an affair with a woman who sleeps with base commanders in order to be allowed to sell insurance to the troops.It is a splendid affair, in which both the recruit and the woman harden and soften, touch and withdraw. The young man's self-sufficiency is almost pierced, and the woman's defenses almost give way to hope. The acting of James Wood is admirable, but Bibi Besch, as the woman, gives the top performance in the picture and somewhere up among the best of the year.As Sergeant Horne, Paul Benjamin provides force and passion, and some beauty. Less subtlety; but it is not Othello's function to be subtle.This is the first full-length feature by Anthony Lover and George Coe. Their initial effort was a short, ""The Dove,"" a charming and terribly funny takeoff on Ingmar Bergman, which is being shown along with ""Distance.""There is no point describing it, other than to say that it's as if Bergman's symbols were holding a drunken cast party. The dove becomes a pigeon, prodigious at doing what pigeons are most noted for. Death plays badminton instead of chess. And so on.",1975-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Luckly Lady' Is Misnomer of Miscast and Mismanaged Comedy,"In Stanley Donen's ""Lucky Lady,"" a Prohibition-era comedy about rum-running off the California coast, Liza Minnelli may remind you of the character played by Madeline Kahn in ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother."" Claire (Miss Minnelli) never says it, but everything about her performance reminds you of Miss Kahn's very funny, phony introductory line: ""I'm an actress. I am simultaneously funny and sad.""Miss Minnelli's Claire is neither funny nor sad but an actress trying like hell to convince you that she is. The more she tries, the worse she gets. About half-way through the movie you feel like shaking her. You want to tell her to start over, to stand up straight, not to walk pigeon-toed and to wipe that silly-sad grin off her face. Waifhood is being abused.As Miss Minnelli's performance is a mistake in make-believe, so is the entire over-produced, under-thought-out production. ""Lucky Lady,"" which opened at two theaters yesterday, is, down deep, a nervous little sparrow of a movie that has been pumped up to the size of a peacock and outfitted accordingly. It's ridiculous without the compensation of being funny or fun.This is difficult to understand, considering the people who are involved. Mr. Donen has directed some of our best musicals and comedies (""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" ""Two for the Road,"" etc.) and he's a man of taste, but here, perhaps, taste is just what's wrong.""Lucky Lady,"" written by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (who wrote ""American Graffiti""), is about three down-on-their-luck losers, Claire, Kibby (Gene Hackman) and Walker (Burt Reynolds), who come together in a Mexican border town during the worst of the American Depression. Through some mysterious alchemy, they become immensely successful bootleggers and, even more surprising to them, a very happy mnage  trois.Seediness should be the operative word if the film is to be funny or sad, yet Mr. Donen and Geoffrey Unsworth, the photographer, have chosen to shoot the movie as if it were a fashion layout for Vogue. Everything is lacquered with chic, even the old yacht, the Lucky Lady, with which the rum-runners begin their business. Seascapes and landscapes are the bleached, shimmery backdrops one associates with tall, bored yogurt-thin models. The film also contains a couple of art deco interiors so stunning they deserve marquee credit.Thus upstaged by the scenery, the actors receive no help from their material, which is virtually nonexistent. The screenplay contains supposedly funny encounters with other bootleggers, the Coast Guard and one fairly spectacular sea battle, but there is nothing in the way of characterization other than what the actors bring to their roles. This is an impossible burden if you're Miss Minnelli and most at ease singing, or Mr. Hackman, whose comedy touch would punch a hole in the side of a battleship.Mr. Reynolds comes off much better. He has a feeling for comedy, especially for the details that make vulgar second-rateness funny.The failure of the ensemble acting is more a failure of casting than of talent, and perhaps three other actors, more suited to each other's moods and styles, could have made something interesting of the central three-sided relationship. Miss Minnelli, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Reynolds can't. They work and work and work, often intelligently, and you don't once believe them. They laugh frequently, but there's not a moment of spontaneous feeling in the whole film.A theoretical case could be made for comic possibilities in having ""Lucky Lady's"" heroine and her two suitors settle down together happily ever after. One can imagine that Marlene Dietrich could have arranged some such thing with George Raft and Edward G. Robinson. In ""Manpower"" (1941) she was a presence to reckon with, but Miss Minnelli is neither interesting nor demanding enough to pull it off, even as a joke.""Lucky Lady"" is really an old-fashioned movie made out of new, cheap, synthetic materials.",1975-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'Black Bird' Certainly No 'Maltese Falcon',"""The Black Bird"" is an enchanting half-hour spoof of Humphrey Bogart and ""The Maltese Falcon."" Too bad it lasts over an hour and a half.It is the problem with takeoffs. A haunted house needs a house as well as a ghost. A movie needs legs as well as decoration. It's all very well to spring out at a party wearing a preposterous costume, but sooner or later you have to say something or at least help pass the sandwiches.There is a lot to be happy with in the early parts of ""Bird."" George Segal is Sam Spade Jr. He has had a soft childhoodyou can see it in his placidity and air of being put-uponand is by no means the man his father was. A point that his secretary, a screaming fright named Effie, constantly dins into him.Anyway he's stuck with his father's private-eye business, a waiting-room full of freaky clients he does his best to avoid, and the Maltese Falcon wrapped in a Miami Beach towel and stashed away in a file cabinet.In marches a representative of the Knights Templar, an undernourished gentleman in an opera cape who offers him $300 to find the falcon and dies quickly. Spade, who wants no trouble, immediately tries to pawn the bird but he's only offered $14.50 and so, reluctantly, he begins to deal.A sidekick turns up. He is Andrew Jackson Immelmanplayed by Lionel Standerand the best thing in the movie. He is made of bricks, talks tough, refuses to hit women despite Spade's urging, reprimands him for calling policemen ""pigs"" and wears a bright green plaid suit.Various rival would-be acquirers of the falcon arrive on the scene. Among them are four Hawaiian gangsters, a midget Nazi and an elegant woman (Stephane Audran) who lives in the silk-draped basement of a Greek Orthodox church.Miss Audran is not cut out for this kind of romp: she always seems to be wearing her best clothes. But that's not the main trouble. Having assembled his carnival, David Giler, the writer, and director, prods them down the endless corridor of a very narrow and winding plot. All of them are on the same level of preposterousness; there is no pace or variety and nothing much for them to do.Delight turns to affection, which turns to tolerance, which turns to a wish that all these funny people would go home. Humphrey Bogart would have sent them home. George Segal is nice and charming and lovable, but he is no private eye: more of a private blink.",1975-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: George Scott in 'Hindenburg',"As disaster movies go, ""The Hindenburg"" is so brainless and so peculiarly optimistic that it could have been the work of Ross Hunter, but wasn't. It is pricelessly funny at the wrong moments. It confirms portentiousness as school of cinematic art. It has George C. Scott, as a good German, saying through a mostly clenched jaw not long after the take-off, ""I have an uneasy sense of disaster.""It has his wife complaining primly, ""That song is going to make me sick,"" as if it were ""Blue Suede Shoes"" and not ""The Horst Wessel Song."" It has characters talking about ""Hermann"" (whose last name is Gring), and it makes completely implausible a perfectly plausible theory about the events that led up to May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg, the Titanic of all lighter-than-air craft, exploded and burned while landing at Lakehurst, N.J.Yet I wouldn't have missed a single foolish frame of it. I sort of like disaster movies, even bad ones, for reasons that have to do with the special effects and with other things that probably go back to the prenatal state.I'm also fascinated by dirigibles, those huge, cigar-shaped, rigid-framed (unlike the ""soft"" blimps of today) aircraft that Germany pioneered, gave a name to (Zeppelin, after the count who built them) and maintained successfully for so many years while ours, including the Macon and Shenandoah, kept cracking up.If ""The Hindenburg"" does nothing else, and I'm not sure that it does, it may at least tease your imagination enough to research this curious chapter in aviation, the first most easily available source being ""The Hindenburg,"" Michael M. Mooney's book, which provides the source material for the film. Like the Mississippi steamboat, the dirigible had a short, glorious, glamorous life and then suddenly expired. Very little of this sense, however, is conveyed by the film that opened at three theaters here yesterday.""The Hindenburg"" is far more schizoid than its three most notable predecessors ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Earthquake""). Unlike those films, which were total fictions, ""The Hindenburg"" is torn between known facts and the fictional narrative that sounds as if it had been manufactured in a Beverly Hills sauna.According to Robert Wise, the director, Nelson Gidding, who wrote the screenplay, and Richard Levinson and William Link, who slipped the other two the story idea, much as if it were a Mickey, the Hindenburg was sabotaged by a young German crew member who wanted to embarrass the Nazis. That part is plausible but the way this is dramatized makes you long for the sanity of ""Take the Money and Run.""Remove the last 10 minutes of the film, which is the length to which Mr. Wise quite effectively stretches the actual disaster and original newsreel footage that lasted less than one minute, and ""The Hindenburg"" is just another, somewhat more tedious ""Grand Hotel in the Sky"" picture.The cast includes just about everybody you didn't especially want to see in a movie right now, though Dana Andrews, Shelley Winters, George Kennedy and Helen Hayes are not in it.Among those who are aboard are William Atherton (the saboteur), Gig Young, Burgess Meredith and Anne Bancroft, who fools around as a German countess named Ursula, which gives Mr. Scott the opportunity to say to her, when he catches her smoking in a potentially inflammable part of the ship.""Behave, Ursula, you know that's dangerous."" The dialogue in this film may be as quietly loony as any you've heard all year.",1975-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Friday Foster',"Times change. Christmas used to inspire great music or enduring sentimental literature. Now it brings us a pile of corpses and a movie equally full of holes called ""Friday Foster.""Students of comic strips will need no introduction. Discriminating moviegoers will want none. Friday Foster, the black model turned photographer, began life in the so-called funnies; and, judging by this film, which opened Christmas Day at the Penthouse and other theaters, has not bettered herself artistically by changing media.Condensing the plot of ""Friday Foster"" actually calls for the talents of an alchemist. But basically, Friday, on assignment from Glance magazine, finds herself in the middle of an attempt to assassinate ""the black Howard Hughes."" Then she finds herself stalked, even into the shower, by one of the would-be assassins. Her efforts to find out what's behind it all lead her to a plot against the nation's black leaders.The action is faster than the calendar, so much so that it comes as a shock to discover that what seems like six days of running around actually takes place in the span from New Year's Eve to St. Valentine's Day.Pam Grier plays the fearless Miss Foster. Yaphet Kotto, whom she calls her ""main man"" after bedding down with Blake Tarr, ""the black Howard Hughes"" (Thalmus Rasulala), and a United States Senator (Paul Benjamin), renders assistance as a private detective.Among those who pass mercifully out of the picture as corpses are Eartha Kitt, who plays a fashion designer, and Godfrey Cambridge, who appears as an effeminate couturier.This is one of those movies where everything and everybody looks a little too goodthe clothes; the pimps; the hookers; the cars; the streets; the bosoms fleetingly bared; and even the blood, which looks as though it ought to carry a vintage.Christmas used to bring us great feasts, too.

Here and there modern, structures intrude, but the city fathers have been careful to maintain Copenhagen's charm. Traffic. is banned from a growing number of streets, and Copenhageners are managing to avoid the frenzied pace that characterizes so many metropolises. The intense campaign in the late nineteensixties to promote the city as the sex cauldron of the western world brought a corresponding increase in the criminal element. In response, the police cracked down on the sex houses, and the tourist industry began stressing Hans Christian Andersen, the Little Mermaid, Danish design and hygge, an untranslatable word implying coziness, comfort and human warmth. But pornography, in the form of pictures, movies and various sexual utensils, is here to stay as is the Danes' love of nudity, amply displayed on beaches in summer and in newspapers all year round.",1975-12-28T05:00:00+0000

Use toothpicks stuck into the sides of the potato, if needed, to keep an inch or so of the base in water. Put the potato in light but not full sun and soon roots and green shoots will develop. Keep the roots covered with water. From Nancy J., a Manhattan, reader, Wash a sweet potato in warm water, cut it in half and suspend the halves cut side down over a glasi of water with onethird of the potato submerged. Purple knobs will appear which turn into leaves and thin roots from the bottom will soon appear. In a month, pot in ordinary soil, leaving the rounded top exposed. From Harriet Cohen, another Manhattan reader, Find a sweet potato that hasn't been treated with chemicals to prevent bud sprouting. Once a natural sweet potato is found, wash it and place it on a bed of mediumsized pebbles arranged in a shallow bowl. Partially fill with water so the water touches the bottom of the sweet potato. Lovely vines will develop and the tuber can in soil.",1975-12-28T05:00:00+0000

After perhaps two minutes, he trotted the length of the field, a wide bandage wrapped around his head to stop the bleeding from a vshaped gash across the hairline in the middle of his forehead. Somewhere on this frozen tundra, his assailant is alone with his conscience. Quickly, the Minnesota Vikings posted a reward of $5,000 for arrest and conviction. But to a great degree, the N.F.L. has only itself to blame. Violence breeds violence. And when the Dallas Cowboys upset the Vikings, 1714, on a controversial touchdown, somebody threw a whiskey bottle at an official because the Vikings had protested that an offensive passinterference penalty should have been called against Drew Pearson, the Cowboys' wide receiver, on Roger Staubach's pass.
