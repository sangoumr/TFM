He met ''the light of my life,'' Natalie Trentowski, at the end of a fencing foil in 1937. They were married in 1940 and had three daughters: Winifred, Barbara, and Beverly. In 1945/46, he served as an Army Corps of Engineers 1st Lieutenant in Manila, the Philippines, utilizing his real estate appraisal skills in the reconstruction efforts. He had joined the New York Life Insurance Company at age 14 as office boy, and rose to Senior Vice President in charge of Real Estate and Mortgage Loans during his 51 years there. He was highly regarded for his ethical integrity, social conscience, and irreverent humor. His business career included membership in the Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, Institute of Real Estate Management, Chicago Real Estate Board, Mortgage Advisory Committee of the New York State Employees' Retirement System, and Advisory Board of NYU's Real Estate Institute. Bill's energy was boundless and his ability to focus this energy over a breadth of interests was amazing. A skillful self-taught carpenter, he obtained a patent on an adjustable rocking horse, remodeled four homes, built exquisite bookcases for his bibliophile wife. He exercised his considerable flair for drama at church play-reading groups and took his family camping in the national parks every summer. He served on the boards of the many Unitarian Universalist Churches he joined as his family moved across the U.S. due to his promotions at NYLIC. He also found time to write eloquent letters to the government against the Vietnam War, supporting reproductive rights, decrying pollution, advocating gun control and the fight against racism. On retirement, he embarked on an active schedule of Elderhostels, and also served as an RTM member in Greenwich, CT. Late in his 70's, he became a volunteer income tax counselor for ''the old folks,'' ESL tutor, and blood donor to age 80. He will be remembered for his creativity, commitment to family and friends, his love of laughter, his embrace of life. After his wife died, Thanksgiving Day, 1996, Bill dreamt he heard her say, ''why don't you join me?'' A confirmed secular humanist, he responded, ''where are you?'' All of us who loved this remarkable, generous man are sure that he will find her. Memorial service, May 31, 3:30 PM, Unitarian Society of Stamford, CT (203-348-0708).

us,The Burden of Duty,"The Hawaiian village they call home might look like a tropical paradise, but since their mother's recent death, life for the Ogata children resembles anything but an idyll. Lois-Ann Yamanaka cultivates a stifling, pungent and cruelly charged atmosphere in her second novel, BLU'S HANGING (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22), as she fluidly explores the brutal divide between family duty and self-preservation, between the power of love and the power of shame. While her moody father drowns his grief in ''hemp tea'' and descends into poverty, 13-year-old Ivah, the eldest child and the book's narrator, becomes a surrogate mother to her two siblings. And they're a handful: her brother, garrulous, overweight Blu, compulsively flirts with the neighborhood perverts; her sister, Maisie, although barely able to speak, manages to incur the racist wrath of her white teachers. Textured with sometimes inscrutable streams of Hawaiian pidgin, the narrative is propelled by the strange illnesses and sexual molestations that plague and scar the characters. When Ivah wins a scholarship to a prestigious boarding school, she faces an excruciating choice: to save herself or protect her vulnerable family. Ms. Yamanaka depicts the children's misfortunes and humiliations in the same clarified yet sensuous detail she uses to render the lush landscape around them. Though the tragedy that besets the Ogatas can feel unremitting, Ms. Yamanaka inventively explores its alchemical nature in the face of love, providing a redemptive conclusion that is as arresting as her characters.

They leave in the spring, but because vultures are perceived as gross, Leesburg deeply wants them not to come home again next October. Lowney proposal -- capturing the vultures in baited cages and carting them off to the wild -- has made southern Virginians fret that they'll be getting unwanted immigrants. Lowney says that the birds will go to the woods, not to a town, and that people could lighten up about these generally helpful carrion eaters.

So the genre's fans will welcome THE VICTORIANS: British Painting 1837-1901 (National Gallery of Art/Abrams, $49.50), by Malcolm Warner with contributions by Anne Helmreich and Charles Brock. Those who pick up the book expecting languidly draped ladies of the popular Pre-Raphaelite painters will not be disappointed; they may be pleasantly surprised, though, by some of the other color plates (and substantial explications) in the book. Mr. Warner, a curator at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, writes that the paintings were selected for their quality rather than for how accurately they represent the period, and this admirable strategy has yielded some lesser-known gems. As science (most potently Darwinism) and industrialization encroached on the traditional concepts of landscape, family and religion, many painters looked backward and employed symbols of the past, particularly of medieval and biblical origin. As Mr. Warner writes, almost all Victorian painting can be seen as ''constantly aspiring toward the condition of faith.'' These works from a self-conscious and anxious age may prove to be surprisingly resonant today. Ted Loos",1997-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Like No One on Earth,"The family at the center of the Canadian writer Barbara Gowdy's third novel, MISTER SANDMAN (Steerforth, $24), is uniquely, whimsically dysfunctional. But it is the unexpected birth of Joan Canary, half idiot savant and half changeling, that catalyzes the individual idiosyncrasies and personal secrets of the people around her, melding them into a clan defined by its eccentricity. Before the arrival of Joan, Gordon, a repressed homosexual, considered himself a devoted homebody, content in his marriage to Doris, a compulsive liar and concealed lesbian. But their attempt at 1950's normalcy comes undone when their placidly slow-witted 15-year-old daughter, Sonja, bears an out-of-wedlock daughter and they decide to raise the dwarfish, nearly albino infant as if she were their own. Doris and Gordon's younger daughter, Marcy, is left out of the loop, but with her telepathic closeness to the ''sister'' who is really her niece, her childhood and adolescence gain a magical quality. Resembling no one in the family (or on earth), Joan proves so sensitive to light that she can play outside only at night; she is so attuned to music that she can perform Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations at 8, though she never bothers with intelligible speech. Using Joan as a sounding board, the person in whom all the others confide, Ms. Gowdy gently and humorously pries into everything they try to conceal from one another, including Gordon's first extramarital affair and Marcy's promiscuity. These secrets flit in and out of their lives the way snatches of popular songs play in their heads. Joan's possibly brain-damaged brilliance lies at the heart of both the narrative and the symbolism of this delightfully quirky novel, in which the Canary family's life emerges as a weird yet often affecting group composition.

us,Grand Designs,"Several architects and planners have had larger roles than Henry Dreyfuss (1904-72) in creating the look of 20th-century America, and other industrial designers were flashier. But none were more creative in making common objects -- sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, tractors, wall thermostats, telephones (a single series of one of his Bell phones sold 162 million units) -- attractive, unobtrusive and easy to use. Dreyfuss was the surrogate for ordinary people when new products were on the drawing boards, as Russell Flinchum says in HENRY DREYFUSS, INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER: The Man in the Brown Suit (Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution/Rizzoli, $50). Dreyfuss never went to college, but he did study with that erratic design genius Norman Bel Geddes before he began a career as a Broadway stage designer in the 1920's and then set up his own industrial design shop in the 30's. He could produce eye-popping marvels, the New York Central Railroad's sleek 20th Century Limited of the late 30's, for instance; Dreyfuss designed everything from the gleaming locomotives to the dishes in the dining car. He designed the Pentagon's war room during World War II and a fabulous flying car after the war. But, as this book demonstrates, his real passion was for everyday objects. The 200 photographs are intensely evocative of the great age of design from the 30's through the 60's, and Mr. Flinchum's account of the designer's life and work is judicious, if not eloquent. One hopes it will lead people to read Dreyfuss's own books, especially ''Designing for People,'' ''The Measure of Man'' and the great ''Symbol Sourcebook: An Authoritative Guide to International Graphic Symbols,'' completed by him and his wife, Doris Marks, in 1972. What Mr. Flinchum does make clear is that, whatever one's estimate of the work of Henry Dreyfuss, he was for decades the outspoken conscience of design in this country. That is just. No one has taken his place. That says a lot about why things look the way they do now. D. J. R. Bruckner",1997-05-11T05:00:00+0000

The Rockefeller University mourns the passing of Keith Porter, who began his career at the university's predecessor, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He left a 50year legacy of significant accomplishments as a pioneer of a new science, modern cell biology. His innovative methodology for the use of the electron microscope, design of the Porter-Blum microtome, and techniques for tissue culturing opened the field of cell biology by allowing much greater insight into the structure and function of cells. While at Rockefeller, Porter co-created the first electron micrograph of an intact cell, along with colleagues Albert Claude and Ernest Fullam. Also, with the aid of the electron microscope, Porter discovered the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, elucidated the structure of collagen fibers, cilia and microtubules, and defined the microtrabecular lattice. In addition, Mr. Porter was a founder and the organizer of the Tissue Culture Association (1946), the Journal of Cell Biology (1955), the premier journal in his field, and the American Society of Cell Biology (1961). Porter was a founding father of modern cell biology, along with two Rockefeller colleagues, Albert Claude and George Palade, who were honored with Nobel Prizes, an award that inexplicably eluded Porter.

We were inseparable for so many years, but not long enough. We share so many memorable experiences and confidences for which I am very grateful. You were a most loving and devoted daughter to Mom and Pop, and a beautiful and rare sister and best friend to me. Your intellect, integrity, sensitivity and ESP made you a very special person. Your high moral principles, never to be compromised, and your adherence to the truth were rare qualities. But it was your genuineness and humility that made people from all walks of life respond to you with friendship and respect. Those shining brown eyes and that magnetic smile reflected your God-given gift of caring and kindness. You were so proud to be a Hunter Class of '42 graduate, and had looked forward to your 55th Alumni Luncheon on May 10. Your love of learning was innate and all encompassing, as was your profound appreciation of the arts -music, avant garde films, ballet and theater. Attending lectures on religion, philosophy and literature was an important part of your life. How fortunate I was to be able to share these wonderful interests with you. As a public housing idealist, you undertook a 41 year career with the NYCHA, devoting yourself as an Assistant Manager. Your sense of responsibility was beyond the ''call of duty.'' Your utmost concern for your tenants, as well as your staff, won you much respect and many friendships. As a mentor who imparted your own life experiences, you motivated and inspired so many whose lives were turned around by your influence. The world is a lesser place without you. You graced it with dignity, decency and beauty. How very much you are missed by so many, especially me. You will be remembered and loved always. May you rest in peace.

He attended Phillips Academy, Andover; Haverford College; and received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Johns Hopkins University where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Signa Xi. He held various positions with the General Electric Co. He was a patentee in silicone chemistry there, and later head of commercial chemical development. Dr. Krieble with his father, Vernon, developed the first commercially successful anaerobic adhesive and founded the Loctite Corporation which later became a Fortune 500 company. Dr. Krieble always believed that private free enterprise was a better promoter of world peace and international cooperation than any governmental organization. At retirement, he founded the Krieble Institute, dedicated to promoting political and economic freedom within the still existing Soviet Empire. In 1989 he was declared an agent of influence and an enemy of the State by the Supreme Soviet for his success in encouraging democracy throughout the Empire, an act which he considered one of his greatest achievements. After the dissolution of the Soviet Empire, Krieble institute volunteers went on to teach the basics of political technology in eleven time zones contributing to the election of over 4,000 elected officials committed to democratic principles. Volunteers also taught basic business techniques and capitalist principles to hundreds of young entrepreneurs. Dr. Krieble was a trustee of Johns Hopkins University as well as the Heritage Foundation, a director of the Hoover Institution, Mont Pelerin Society, Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, Citizens Democracy Corp. (a Reagan Presidential Appointment), Jamestown Foundation, Empower America and many more. Among his many awards were the Commerical Development Association Honor Award, The Eagle Award in Public Affairs and The Chemical Industry Association's Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1979.

us,The Work of Reconstruction,"''Different things get taken from you in the course of a life,'' reflects the heroine of Brian Keith Jackson's affecting first novel. Set in a black community in the rural South, THE VIEW FROM HERE (Pocket Books, $22) is a quiet story about a woman's odyssey from powerlessness to self-possession. Anna Thomas has been awash in a sea of domestic duty and obligation for as long as she can remember. Cut off from her one source of emotional sustenance, her free-spirited friend Ida Mae, Anna has been consumed by the needs of her five sons and her husband, Joseph, a taciturn man who takes to the bottle after losing his job at the lumber mill. When Anna discovers she is pregnant with a sixth child and Joseph insists that she give the infant to his treacherous sister, Anna reluctantly agrees to yet another sacrifice, even though she's sure the new baby will be a daughter. Isolated and lonely, she writes letters in her head to Ida Mae and talks to her child. Mr. Jackson's prose has a visceral pungency, and if at times his imagery veers toward the sentimental, such excesses never undermine the drama of his story. Rebellious Ida Mae, who has fled the trap of domesticity, serves as a foil to Anna's dutiful self-effacement. But when Anna learns what has befallen her friend, her inner world shifts; at last she is able to obey the imperatives of her heart. ''Certain things must end before others can begin,'' she reflects. Or, as her daughter later puts it, ''Even the faintest of lights begin in darkness.'' Andrea Barnet",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Reed, a member of Magnum, the photojournalists' cooperative, earns his living covering wars and making portraits of movie stars. BLACK IN AMERICA (Norton, $29.95), his second book, is a personal project, a record of the moments that do not make the news. Mr. Reed treats everyday life like a front-page story and transforms monumental events into intimate moments. For example, he depicts a girl, in the aftermath of the 1992 riots in South Central Los Angeles, holding objects she has rescued from the wreckage of her home, literally picking up the pieces of her life. His images of Yusef Hawkins's funeral in Brooklyn in 1989 show a sea of glaring faces looking anxious and lost. The book's final image, taken at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Montgomery, Ala., in 1995, shows a child reaching to touch the engraved words. While the individual pictures are powerful, the book sometimes seems disjointed. The photographs are not grouped chronologically; Mr. Reed has made no attempt at telling a story. His powerful images leave us grasping to find our own way through the past and into the future. Jake Miller",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

To Siesel, 34, this implicit reference to vacationers' snapshots brings out the real nature of the neighborhood: ''It's incredible the way people from all over the world flock here, looking for something.

''The sitters are involved in the dialogue from the very beginning. They get off the stool and lobby for a different angle or more flattering lighting. Slowly the two of us work together toward building an image.'' Which means that he had a potential problem: vanity. But, he says, ''I found that in most every case they were easy to work with.'' Because Close began using the camera only as a tool to capture images for his paintings, he feels he brings an oddly unprofessional sensibility to photography.

While construction workers are in one sense the living embodiments of progress, they are also ''a social group that doesn't change even as the world changes.'' Fiorio often has her subjects pose for her or repeat actions so they can ''become the star of their own life movie'' -- an approach that may bend the rules of photojournalism but one that helps her bring out the ''image of the body and the strength of physicality -- it is what affirms life and eats it up.''",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Lyle Ashton Harris: WORKADAY JUXTAPOSITIONS,"With an eye toward creating a series of still-picture performance pieces, Lyle Ashton Harris brought strangers off the street and onto the stage of the derelict Liberty Theater. ''We wanted to draw in the kaleidoscopic nature of a Times Square in flux -- the juxtaposition of new and old, gender and class, tourists and New Yorkers,'' says Harris, who lives in Los Angeles. To Harris and his collaborator, Tommy Gear, the ''beauty of it all was that not everyone woke up that morning thinking they might be photographed. We were really playing with the notion of who can be on the stage.'' Wilma Prezzi, an 81-year-old sculptor and novelist who has lived in the neighborhood for years, says of the experience: ''I was chided a bit by my friends for daring to go into a theater of that condition. But when I hesitated, one of the security guards came over and took my arm and said that there was nothing to worry about.'' Fred Hakim, owner of the Limark Foods hot dog stand on 42d Street, has been on the block for 56 years, having slopped his first sauerkraut at his father's stand as an 11-year-old. ''I've seen so much. I've been through the blackout and World War II,'' he says. Referring to the area's renovation, he adds, ''I hope they let me stay when it's all over.''",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Bassman, who is 79, made her reputation with fashion photography for Harper's Bazaar in the 1940's and 50's; she recalls that Broadway ''lacked excitement'' on that cold spring night, leaving the images ''stark and with a kind of coldness.'' So she doctored the prints using ''bleach, a paintbrush, my fingers, cotton and my eyes and my temperament'' to add a patina of fantasy.

Still, he says he feels that the Times Square he has watched disappear played a cathartic role in city life. ''There is a kind of gloom that sets in at a certain hour that seems to represent the darker side of something that's in all New Yorkers,'' he explains.

David Grohl -- who writes, sings, plays guitar and socks the drums for the Foo Fighters -- was Nirvana's drummer, and his songs for the Foo Fighers draw on his previous band's musical sources: the Beatles for chords and melodies, punk rock and Black Sabbath for impact, Neil Young for plaintive bluntness and the Pixies for sudden blasting choruses. The subject matter isn't exactly unprecedented, either: breaking up and making up, anger and loneliness and confusion. But rock songs don't usually depend on grand innovations. Timing, ingenuity and conviction can be all it takes to make rock's common materials ring with passion. That's what happens on ''The Color and the Shape,'' as Grohl balances power and tenderness, whipsaw riffing and wistful tunes.",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

She quickly found herself wrapped up in the stories of the women she met in the hotels and in the improbable communities they had staked out. ''You look at a woman's life and see she has only a small room and you think she has a small life -- you make that up -- but in truth she has a big life and is very active,'' Leibovitz explains.

That the owners of the gaslit Victorians and Tudors include both whites and blacks is a fact that residents of South Orange, and its sister township, Maplewood, see as a crucial part of their suburban identity.

us,Abelardo Morell: A SIMULATION OF SIGNS,"''I want a sort of historical record of what a room sees,'' says Abelardo Morell, a 48-year-old Cuban immigrant who lives in Brookline, Mass. Thus his penchant for the ancient technique of the camera obscura, in this case constructed by using the room itself as a camera, blacking out all but a half-inch circle of a window -- the aperture -- in room 1123 at the Times Square Marriott. Morell then set a camera on a tripod near the aperture, directing it into the room to record the optical phenomenon. Making a single exposure over two days, he captured a scene of meditative calm -- the room -- superimposed with the anarchy of Broadway. ''Think about how many people go through this site in two days -- millions -- and no one stood still long enough to get seen,'' he says. ''It's so empty, almost a perverse picture.''",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

''It is a ghostlike place in the daylight, always empty,'' says the 41-year-old Swede. ''Yet there was this remarkable effort to make these empty buildings look nice. I suppose they'll be knocked down soon.'' Tunbjork, who is documenting office workers on three continents, is energized by the area's mix of grit, commercialism and buttoned-down corporatism. With tchotchke shops and McDonald's abutting trading floors and the Eighth Avenue sex industry, Tunbjork says he's ''never been to a place where you find so many different things in such a small area.''",1997-05-18T05:00:00+0000

There were a few Canadian writers then, but with their usual modesty the Canadians hid them from view, and you had to dig for them at the very backs of bookstores, among the maple syrup cookbooks and the autumn scenery.

Its peak lies 29,028 feet above sea level on the border of Tibet and Nepal -- the highest spot on earth. The first ascent took place 44 years ago this month. Since then, according to Jon Krakauer's new book, ''Into Thin Air,'' Everest has been climbed more than 630 times. Since 1921, when the first British expedition reached the base of the mountain, 150 climbers have died on its slopes, including the five who have died so far this season. The top of Everest is high enough to penetrate the jet stream, and the summit can be gained only when the jet stream has been diverted northward, during a rare interval of good weather before the summer monsoon blows in from the Bay of Bengal. What kills climbers is almost never the technical difficulty of the most familiar route, which is not extreme. It is the weather -- abruptly, unexpectedly fouling the mountain, as it did last year, when eight climbers died in the aftermath of a sudden storm.",1997-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,A Chevelle Comes to Paradise,"WONDERFUL WOMEN BY THE SEA (New Press, $25), a first novel by the Finnish short-story writer Monica Fagerholm, is itself wonderful. Written in an impressionistic style and subtly translated from the original Swedish by Joan Tate, the story follows the summer escapades of two families during the early 1960's. Made up of radiant vignettes that slip backward and forward in time, Ms. Fagerholm's narrative often feels like a series of snapshots in words, a linguistic photo album. Thomas, from whose perspective most of the novel is recounted, is a small child when he first goes with his parents, Isabella and Kayus, to the ''white villa,'' a summer cottage on a beautiful bay. There he meets (and comes to worship) Renee, a headstrong girl who lives nearby with her parents, Rosa and Gabriel. Renee's family has recently returned from America, bringing with them a Chevrolet Chevelle, complete with a bar in the trunk. Isabella, who has movie-star beauty and charm, befriends Rosa; they discuss Elizabeth Taylor's love life and paint their toenails white. They are among the first women on the beach to wear monokinis. With the passing of each summer, however, their little paradise is threatened by inevitable changes -- particularly the growing restlessness of these ''wonderful women by the sea.'' Although we are aware almost from the first page that Thomas's childhood world is doomed, this knowledge doesn't make its destruction any less painful. Jenny McPhee",1997-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Knickerbocker Gothick,"Along the shores of the Hudson River between New York City and Albany are to be found a surprising number of great mansions -- castles even. A few remain in private hands, others have been restored and are open to the public, and many are in ruins. These last are evocatively captured by Monica Randall's sepia-tinted photographs in PHANTOMS OF THE HUDSON VALLEY: The Glorious Estates of a Lost Era (Overlook, $55; $65 after Dec. 31). The well-known homes like the Rockefellers' Kykuit and Jay Gould's Lyndhurst don't gain much in the moody images here, but Ms. Randall's treatments of the Scottish-styled island fortress of the notorious arms dealer Francis Bannerman (near Fishkill) and the unlucky and never finished Dick's Castle in Garrison capture the haunting atmosphere of great wealth's trappings gone to seed. Ms. Randall is perhaps a little too receptive to tales of ghosts walking the riverbanks, but this is Washington Irving territory after all. And she does provide entertaining lore along with her pictures. There's the magnificent Beechwood, where the author is told Isadora Duncan once danced on the lawn. (Ms. Randall is also told that the Wright Brothers landed their new plane there and that a madman named Mathias murdered five beautiful virgins and buried them in the basement, so who knows?) The place has been turned into condominiums. And then there is Wyndcliff. Now deserted and falling down, it was built in 1852 by Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones, a cousin of Mrs. William B. Astor. It is likely that many residents of at least some parts of the present-day Hudson Valley can relate to this Gothic monstrosity.
