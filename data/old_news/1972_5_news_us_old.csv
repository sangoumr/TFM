us,Screen: A Social Satire From Brazil:'Macunaima' Arrives at Fifth Avenue Cinema Film Travels Between the City and Jungle,"Joaquin Pedro de Andrade's ""Macunaima,"" which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, is a social satire in the form of a picaresque adventure, full of the elements of a fairy tale and proceeding according to a logic that seems to have been learned in the academy of the shaggy dog story.It is also rather a failure in each department. But its ambitions are such that I keep wanting to admire them, and wishing that the skill, invention and energy of ""Macunaima"" were in any way up to the potential of its forms.Loosely based on a novel written in 1928 by Mario de Andrade, the Brazilian man of letters who is no relation to the director, the film covers the entire life and times of one Macunaima, born a Negro, at what appears to be 45 years of age, to a savage family in the wilds of Brazil. The times are approximately our own.The life, which moves between modern city and primitive jungle and transforms Macunaima from middle-aged black baby to handsome young white man (and occasionally back again), consists mostly of extravagent ups and downs. Macunaima has terrific luck with women and dreadful luck with almost everything else. But at the end it is a woman who does him ina water spirit named Iara. She eats him.It should be mentioned that ""Macunaima"" is very much about cannibalismor, rather, about the economic and political problems of Brazil understood in terms of cannibalismand that it means at all times to temper its humor with savagery.It includes among its characters an evil giant (a giant industrialist, as it happens) who literally stews guests in his swimming pool, a preparation for soup stock.But the audacity that is so heavily belabored in ""Macunaima"" is generally more interesting as idea than as achieved image, and the movie fails by being never as comic or as shocking or as comically shocking as it wants and desperately needs to be.As satire it largely repeats conventional formulas. And though more sensational, it is less anarchic than, say, the American madcap comedy of the 1940's that it partly imitates.I suppose it is ultimately a matter of degrees. The performances aren't good enough, the direction isn't sure enough, the insights don't go deep enough to do more than suggest a kind of awkward dancing at the altar of current revolutionary orthodoxies.",1972-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Fiction of a Sort:Resnais's 'Je T'Aime' Opens at New Yorker,"""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, was shown at the eighth New York Film Festival. The following is from Roger Greenspun's review, which appeared Sept. 15, 1970, in The New York Times.Like most of the previous films of Alain Resnais, ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"" is science fiction of a sort. And like virtually all of Resnais's previous films, its concern is for the past recaptured. To support this concern it proposes a story, the most fragmented of all Resnais' stories, dealing with, perhaps intense but nevertheless transitory love affair.Claude (Claude Rich), having recovered from an unsuccessful suicide attempt, is picked for an experiment by a secret research center that studies time. Claude, along with a laboratory mouse, is placed inside a large soft brain-shaped structure, from which he is to be transported back to relive one minute at 4 in the afternoon exectly one year ago. He does relive that minute (he is snorkeling on vacation in southern France, and ""underwater"" becomes a recurring image and idea for the film), but he begins reliving it several times overand then in bits and pieces he begins to relive other moments scattered through the seven years he lived with Catrine (Olga Georges-Picot), whom he thinks he killed and for whose death he had tried to kill himself.Assuming that they have lost him forever, and sadly admitting that their experiment has been a most incomplete success, the research scientists wander out of the laboratoryonly to discover Claude, a bullet in his gut (he has most recently relived his botched suicide) lying on the grass. But in their despondency and concern they forget the little mouse, who did come back, and now sniffs forlornly inside his container within the giant brain.I am disturbed by that mouse, not only for the bathos of the image but also because his situation so ludicrously (and, I think, so intentionally) recalls that of the wife, Simone, looking for her husband, already light years away, inside another woman's deserted apartment at the end of Resnais's one masterpiece, ""Muriel."" For ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"" resembles ""Muriel"" in so many close ways that the success of the older film (1963) stands in almost total reproach to the general banality of the newer one.Although obsessed with time, memory, the past, the physical material of ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"" is its love story and the daily lives of the couple involved in it. But in that story and in those lives it finds so little of interest or urgency that with all its perceptual complexity it comes to seem an enormous and ingenious structure with almost nothing inside it.",1972-05-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Cliff Robertson's 'J. W. Coop':Film's Star Also Wrote, Directed, Produced It","""J. W. Coop,"" written, directed and produced by Cliff Robertson, who also plays its title role, is the story of 10 months in the life of a lonely, slightly overage rodeo circuit rider, photographed almost entirely in and around those small Western rodeos that canif the rider is goodearn a man $60,000 a year, plus another $60,000 in endorsements for things like soft drinks and underwear.When it limits its focus to what J. W. Coop is thinking, or tries to interpret his emotions, the film is unsurprisingly self-conscious, the work of a new filmmaker who is no better or worse than you might expect him to be. When, however, it draws back to see and hear the world around J. W. Coop, which is most of the time, it becomes very fine, almost elegiac, as full of feeling for rootless American lives as any film I've seen since ""Derby,"" which was, after all, a documentary.According to the production notes, Robertson researched his screenplay by following the rodeo circuit and tape-recording conversations, but that cannot, I think, explain the accuracy of so many things in the film not immediately related to professional rodeoing. Overheard at a hamburger stand is a child calling: ""When's dinner, Mom?"" Answers the impatient mom as she climbs into a Barracuda, or a Galaxy, or a Comet, or some such vehicle: ""When I get done bowling!""Robertson's screenplay is no great shakes as narrative, but it takes a certain courage to amble as amiably as it does. The film follows Coop from his release after nine years in prison (for passing a bad check and then beating up a sheriff), through his return to the rodeo circuit and an idealized affair with a funny, ecology-minded, nut-chewing hippie (Christina Ferrare), up through the rodeo championships in Oklahoma City.It includes quite a lot of spectacular rodeo footage, and dramatic things do happen to Coop in and out of the arena, but Robertson wisely allows his character, which he plays with beautifully authentic, small-town Texas accent, to be defined as much by what we see as by what he does. The movie records things that Coop doesn't necessarily noticea Texas bus in which all the blacks sit in the front seats while the whites more or less huddle in the back, a rodeo parade with a huge, flowered float labeled ""Church of The Nazarene."" When an old cowboy wants to stress a point, he says, ""I guaran-damntee!""The language is beautiful and often very funny. This isas far as I can rememberthe first film in which (as reported in dialogue) an airplane has ever been eaten by cows, in which a truck driver talks, with absolute sincerity, about the blessings of Jimmy Hoffa, and in which a farmer philosophizes about labor: ""You don't agitate the fruit, and you don't agitate the pickers.""There are occasional moments when the movie goes awkwardly sentimental, when it weeps for the passing of the old and the coming of the new, but its point of view is mostly amused and tough, and full of unpatronizing appreciation for its people, the rodeo characters as well as the professional actors. Of the latter, the most noticeable, next to Robertson himself, is Geraldine Page as Coop's addle-brained mother who keeps her radio tuned to cheery revivalists and apparently sleeps with a chicken in her bedroom.""J.W. Coop"" opened yesterday at the Columbia Theater.",1972-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Ann Arbor Films at Whitney,"The selection of short movies from the 10th Ann Arbor. Film Festival that opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum is pretty evenly divided between narrative (not necessarily fictional) vignettes and more or less strict abstractions. And by the grace of whatever gods balance the quality of movie programs, the two best films, Ira Wohl's ""Co-Co Puffs"" and Standish Lawder's ""Raindance,"" come one each from narrative cinema and the cinema of abstract forms.""Co-Co Puffs"" is a cinemaverit account of a drum lesson, in which a young woman spends some time with an unusually dedicated teacher (""Everything you do has something to do with drums"") and learns how to make a new soundthe ""Co-Co Puffs"" of the title.It doesn't seem like much, and in treating it the film is quite without pretensions as to scope. But even in the weird context of a drum lesson there is space for doubts and confidence, for false starts and a few seconds of real victory.Ira Wohl is aware of both the dignity and the embarrassment of his situation, and for a study of somebody attempting something new, such awareness leads to sharp and rather lovely insights.Mr. Lawder developed ""Raindance"" out of some old animated footage, a pattern of driving rain, upon which he works perhaps a quarter of an hour of rich and highly disciplined variations proceeding through multiple wipes, changes in color and changes in duration and intensity of light, ""Raindance"" becomes a kind of tour-de-force demonstration in ways of achieving maximum effect from minimal means.Rosalind Schneider's ""Abstraction,"" a study of forms reflected and greatly distorted in (I think) crinkled aluminum foil, is probably the most serious film in the program. It is handsome and greatly suggestive of meaning, but I am not sure that it supports its somewhat ponderous rhetoric with an equal proportion of real discovery.Miss Schneider has interesting ideas about a kind of moviemaking, and I believe she will become very good. But for the present it is more fun to follow the modest demands of Mr. Lawder's two-minute ""Color Film,"" Andrew Lugg's five-minute ""Gemini Fire Extension,"" or the double, triple, quadruple exposure of Pat O'Neill's delightful ""Last of the Persimmons.""A kind of modesty attends Morley Markson's ""Our Trip to Bubieeta in Miami Beach""false modesty, I believe. A diary film, narrated, acted out, and largely sung by two precocious little girls (Markson's daughters) who visit their grandmother in Florida, it has approximately the freshness, simplicity, and innocence of an F.A.O. Schwartz toy catalogue.But it at least earns its style more honestly than Allan Holleb's ""Heavenly Star,"" a pseudo-affectionate takeoff put-down of the early 1950's in the form of a movie-musical production number exploiting almost every dramatic dance clich in the bookGene Kelly's book, or Stanley Donen's. Although Holleb knows how to parody his originals' vulgarity, I don't think he knows how to value it, and so he falls into a vulgarity of his ownunfeeling, superficially observant, divided between open condescension and disguised contempt.",1972-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Sadly, ""The Legend of Nigger Charley"" is fair. Fair only.In the first chapter of this drama, three plucky slaves flee a Virginia plantation and a mean, near-psychopathic new master. They then appear in a tiny frontier town, where a quaking white resident tells them (and us) that the fugitive trio's leader is ""already a legend."" After a saloon shoot-up, felling a slave-hunter, still another half-cracked white, the trio rides on.Finally, in the best part of the film, the three men shield a poor white farmer and his half-caste wife from some vicious townspeople, led by an outright lunatic. One quiet dinner scene, as the visitors and the couple await attack, conveys more about racial hatred, cruelty and blindness, than the rest of the picture.But generally it rambles and dawdles, resolving tensions with conventional shootouts, like any standard Western. Another thinghow on earth did the three slaves get from Old Virginny to the snowcapped frontier peaks? What about encounters and dangers along the way? How about that for drama? And what has a blaring, jazzy rock 'n'roll sound-track got to do with the Old West or old anything?As Charley, a former athlete named Fred Williamson shows definite acting flair.

us,Formula for 'The Honkers':James Coburn Cast in Role of Rodeo Rider,"Because there are so few certifiable American B movies anymore, it would be nice to say something gracious about ""The Honkers,"" a rodeo film that, like Cliff Robertson's ""J. W. Coop,"" has its antecedents in the Saturday-afternoon formula films of the 1930's and 1940's.Unfortunately, Steve Ihnat, who directed ""The Honkers"" and wrote its screenplay (with Stephen Lodge), lacks Robertson's ability (and perhaps freedom) to enrich an old formula with discoveries made in real life, as well as the kind of direct, no-nonsense narrative talent that occasionally elevated some B's (Nicholas Ray's ""The Lusty Men"") to A status. When Ihnat uses authentic rodeo characters, they seem to be just self-conscious actors. He also has terrible fondness for pretty dawn-and-dusk cloud shots of the sort that, 30 years ago, no self-respecting B-picture patron would have tolerated for the time it takes to swallow a mouthful of Crackerjacks.""The Honkers"" is the sluggish and sentimental record of three bad days in the life of Lew Lathrop (James Coburn), a good-natured rodeo circuit rider whose only fault seems to be that he is a little more self-centered than can be accommodated by a faithful wife.After a couple of years on the road, Lew and his adoring sidekick, a rodeo clown played by Slim Pickens, return to Lew's hometown where he abuses his wife, alienates his son and becomes the indirect cause of the death of a friend. If the movie can be said to take a position on anything, I guess you could say it comes out firmly against self-centeredness.It opened here yesterday at the Astor and other theaters on a double bill with a reissue of Sergeo Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars.""",1972-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Jekyll's position is not wholly unhappy. In love by turns with both the son and daughter of the widow on the first floor, Jekyll is embarrassed only by never knowing which sex he's going to be when, and by a seemingly insatiable need for more female hormonesso as to get the elixir formula right.It is the question of hormone supply, more a problem in logistics than in morality, that finally does Dr. Jekyll inand also pretty much does in his movie, ""Dr. Jekyll & Sister Hyde,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters. For while a sex-change Dr. Jekyll has the potential for some interest, collecting the hormones (an inevitable progression from purchasing at the morgue to stealing corpses to killing the tender young tarts of London to almost knifing the girl upstairs) has no such potential. And yet it is so indulged, provoking so many midnight murders, that it finally overpowers the film in a tedious repetition of dull suspense and unsuspenseful shock.I should say a word for Martine Beswick as Mrs. Hydevery handsome in the skull-beneath-the-skin tradition of Barbara Steeleand for Roy Ward Baker, whose directorial reticence generally makes things bearable even when they aren't much fun.However, Seth Holt's ""Blood From the Mummy's Tomb,"" which shares the bill with Dr. Jekyll and his sister, is for almost its entire length tremendous fun, skillful and wonderfully energetic. It is not so much a fiction movie as a stringing together of direful devices, but I can think of few more guiltily pleasant excuses for overstaying a lunch hour, avoiding duty, or merely escaping the sunshine on a summer afternoon.Of course ""Blood From the Mummy's Tomb"" has a story, an uncommonly elaborate variation on the kind of revenge from beyond the grave that, from the nature of their discipline, Egyptologists keep running into. But it has so much more that I am inclined just to list a few attractions: a severed hand, a sacred cat, a jackal's skull, five mad scientists, an otherwise marvelously cracked or half-cracked cast, a fine respect for the horror heritage, a young hero named Tod Browning, and for a heroine a millenium's old free-floating astral spirit named Terawho, as currently embodied in Miss Valerie Leon, is a 500 per cent knockout.",1972-05-18T05:00:00+0000

And if one were forced to explain the meaning of Open Heart, one would have to call it an attempt to envision the boundlessness of Christian love and the mystery of faith, and to reflect them both in a funhouse mirror. But praise and analysis seem out of order herejust as they do in happy families (as Tolstoy once implied). In happy families, you relax and enjoy. Relax and en joy then, as we meet once again the family that first appeared in Mr. Buechner's Lion Country, to which Open Heart is the sequel. There's Harry Bebb, the one true founder of Holy Love Church, with his trick eyelid that goes involuntarily up and down like a window shade, and his almost certain disreputable past. There's his wife, Lucille, drinking gin and orange juice all day in front of a TV set with the green hue turned up too high. There's Mr. Buechner's narrator, Antonio Parr (in a more analytic frame of mind, we'd have to read that Parr for everyman), who went to Florida originally to write an expos of Bebb's religious diploma mill but who ended up marrying Bebb's daughter Sharon.",1972-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: A Graceful 'Uncle Vanya',"Chekhov's ""Uncle Vanya,"" first produced by the Moscow Art Theater in 1898, is seldom done in this country, perhaps because a poor production can make it seem to be the Chekhovian parody that one of New York's drama critics called it in the 1930's. The landscape is familiar enough: a collapsing country estate inhabited by characters who long to be somewhere else, who bicker at tea, and who talk on through evening and night about art, which they miss, provincialism, which is stifling them, inheritances, which are slipping away, opportunities, which they've already lost, and the weatherit seems always about to rain, or to have just finished.Anton Chekhov was the most thoughtful of great dramatists. He wrote plays that, if done badly enough, turn into auto-critiques, something that was apparent in both the Russian film version of ""The Three Sisters,"" released here in 1969, and Sidney Lumet's English language adaptation of ""The Sea Gull"" (1968).Because there have been so few screen adaptations of Chekhov's plays seen here, it doesn't mean as much as I wish it did to say that the new Russian film version of ""Uncle Vanya,"" which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater, is probably the best filmed Chekhov I've ever seen. Adapted and directed by Andrei Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky, this ""Uncle Vanya"" is an exceedingly graceful, beautifully acted production that manages to respect Chekhov as a man of his own time, as well as what I would assume to be the Soviet view of Chekhov as Russia's saddest, gentlest, funniest and most compassionate revolutionary playwright.At the beginning of the film, Astrov (Sergei Bondarchuk), the doctor who plants trees in hopes of making future civilizations more humane, sits on the verandah in the September heat and wonders if the coming generations will remember. ""They will forget,"" he says with resignation. ""God won't forget,"" says the old nanny who looks exactly like Nikita Khrushchev and, from time to time, comments on what's going on with appropriate truisms.Like God, the Soviet director has not forgotten, and only in a couple of instances (in the opening credits, for example) does he bear down rather heavily on Chekhov as the scourger of the old order and the prophet of something new. For the most part, the film proceeds at Chekhov's own pace as the camera, which has the presence of a household intimate, follows the action in close-up, sometimes overhearing scenes from adjoining rooms, sometimes, as if by chance, becoming so involved in the action that it doesn't remember to give us an establishing shot until a scene is almost completed.Mikhalkov - Konchalovsky occasionally plays with stage effects (dropping the lights to end a scene with a character in silhouette) and arbitrary film effects (for some reason that I can't fathom the movie alternates between sepia and lovely, autumnal color). Most of the time, however, everything he does seems to be in the service of the text, and of the actors who perform it.They are all marvelous. Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Uncle Vanya, the estate manager who, at 47, imagines (improperly) that had he not wasted his life in the service of his fraudulent brother-in-law, he would have been a Dostoyevsky or a Schopenhauer; Bondarchuk as Astrov, a man who measures his cynicism more carefully than he admits; Irina Kupchenko as Sonya, a lovely, pathetic girl who is left to turn old on the estate with only hopes of heaven to talk about; and Irina Miroschnichenko as Yelena, the young wife of the estate's owner, the second-rate literary celebrity and the outsider who has systematically wrecked the lives of everyone around him.With the exception of some very Soviet-sounding, things-to-come sort of music behind the opening credits, the sounds of the movie are pure Chekhov, those of bored conversations, sudden explosions of anger and silences framed by the echoes of distant thunder or trains or the barking of dogs.""Uncle Vanya"" has been remembered by the filmmakers with deep appreciation and taste.",1972-05-19T05:00:00+0000

If they really were among the best films from Ann Arbor, then Ann Arbor this year has fallen to a fairly low level of generally academic production.They include a line-drawing cartoon (Mary Beams's ""Tub Film""), an open-ended impressionistic documentary (Jonathan Else's ""You Don't Die Here""), a women's lib parable (Llanne Brandon's ""Anything You Want to Be""), a gentle personal reverie (David Devensky's ""Homecall""), a hard-hitting national reverie (""Goodbye Billie, America Goes to War 1917-18,"" by Patric Griffin, R. C. Raack, and William Malloch), a humorous sources-of-film study (""Three Colloquies"" by Will Baker), and an animated painting (""Animated Painting,"" by Jeff Wein).That's it, except for Dave McCullough's ""Particle Removal Series,"" which I can't categorize and which I rather liked. Since it deals wholly and precisely with how to rid yourself of wooden slivers, fingernail dirt, etc., perhaps it can be classified as a specialized-taste movie.I see no reason why any of the other filmmakers should not make good movies. But I don't see that any of them has as yet.

A black himself, he believed that the educational system is involved in a conspiracy to miseducate masses of Black and Puerto Rican students... to crush and penalize those individuals who even before birth are doomed to failure. The antidotes he urged were a student's bill of rights to prevent the arbitrary use of power by principals and greater community control by blacks and Puerto Ricans. This book is more than a chronicling of academic machinations; it is an autobiography of sorts, a portrait of a talented young man flailing. With the ear and eye of a born novelist Reeves reports on his childhood amidst the tropical sounds, and smells of a Jamaica private school, on his boyhood swimming away from the dope and horror and blood of Brownsville, on his affair with a white girl who used him (as, he confesses, he sought to use her). One gets the impression he became an activist as much from boredom as from frustration, As Reeves prophesied, not too much was accomplished by the movement he led.

In fact the book contains only one version of America, which runs roughly like this: If there was a good American dream of individual freedom and plenty, then (quoting Tom Wolfe quoting Ken Kesey) WE BLEW IT?

They prove, Mr. Nelson concludes, that the effect of the American experience on the individual who cannot adjust to the mindless mass ranges from impotence, disappearance and despair to madness, martyrdom and murder, with cynical withdrawal and panic flight as further alternatives. Mr. Nelson's method ignores that fact that the characters exist only in fictional space and assumes that the 10 novels are accurate accounts of the state of America.

During World War II and the 1948 war he became a seasoned op, and in 1952 Prime Minister Ben Gurion appointed him head of the Secret Service, a position he held with complete anonymity until 1963, when his resignation precipitated a Cabinet crisis. His coups include putting down dissident organizations in the early days of Israel, and warning of King Abdullab's intention to attack in 1948.

This type of preventive maintenance and preseason checkup will not only serve to minimize the likelihood of a breakdown later on (usually right in the middle of a heat spell), it will also give the owner plenty of time to have repairs made, if needed. After pulling off the air conditioner's cover on the outside (assuming that one was put on at the end of the previous season) the first thing that should be done is to take out the builtin filter and inspect it to see if it needs cleaning or replacement. The best test is to hold the filter up and look through it at a bright light; if no light shows through it needs to be cleaned (if it is the permanent type that is washable) or replaced (if it is the disposable type).",1972-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Consequently, on the mainland of the two Americas, the European rivalries were fierce enough; but in the islands of the Caribbean, and especially in the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, a grim game of grab ensued between the nascent imperialisms of half a dozen European nations.

us,'Malcolm X',"We suspect that even the slain subject of the documentary ""Malcolm X,"" depicted as an uncommonly shrewd man, would concur with our one reservation about this film. Over and over, relentlessly and interminably, it pelts the viewer with random footage of armed whites battering blacks. Granted, this turbulence suits the fiery, autobiographical quotes (from James Earl Jones) of the subject's formative years. But it becomes simply monotonous punctuation in the thoughtful last chapter of a generally rounded, often fascinating movie.It is the documentary core of this film, in the black militant's speeches and interviews and the movie's surprisingly balanced format, quoting dissenters in policy, that makes its real worth. The picture was adapted by Arnold Perl from ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X."" His widow, Betty Shabazz, a cosponsor of the movie and a woman with a beautiful speaking voice, appears briefly and effectively, one of many meaningful cameos.The personal drama is so credible and ironic, as the dynamic leader breaks with his Islam colleagues and strives, more reflectively, for Afro-American unity, that the footage of the gunned-down Malcolm (a chaotic aftermath) comes as a jolt. The conclusion, with the funeral and various testimonies, is numbing and touching.

Now 33, he has published two novels, two novellas, short stories and various political, social and literary essays. But advance rumors hardly prepare one for this first translation of his major work. My Michael is anything but a provincial achievement; it has nothing to do with noble kibbutzim, Sten guns and sabras, nor with the Talmudic dryness of Israel's Nobel Prizewinner, the late S. Y. Agnon. It's quite the last kind of book one expects from a young writer living in the midst of a melodramatic political situation, for My Michael is an extremely selfconscious and serious psychological novel, slow, thoughtful, selfassured and highly sophis ticated, full of the most skillful modula tions of tone and texture. On the surface it is very much what used to be called a woman's novel""the story of a disinte grating marriage told from the unhappy wife's point of view. In a way it's a modern Israeli Madame Bovary, a finely wrought portrait of a woman that is also a critique of a superficial masculine society.

This is something that Demy, with the help of the writers who worked with him on the screenplay, repeatedly emphasizes in the story extensions, which are almost always cruel, and in the color images, which are soft and lovely, but in the way of dark corners, tangled underbrush and piles of rotting leaves, things that can hide unspeakable terrors for the very young.The film, which Demy shot mostly in Germany with an English cast, features among other things, the burning at the stake of Melius the Jew, an old chemist who persists in seeking some kind of protection against the coming plague, instead of manufacturing fool's gold for the baron.There are also the marriage against her will, of the brgermeister's 11-year-old daughter, a pale, wispy girl who looks hardly 9, to the baron's evil son; bad-dream scenes of rats coming out of cakes, crawling out of beds, of people dying of plague, and, of course, the ending in which all the children of Hamelin follow the vengeful piper out of Hamelin, dancing into the countryside, never to be seen again.It's a very odd film, too scary for some children, I suspect, and too childlike for most adults, with the result that everything in the film becomes its own kind of anachronism, whether it's Donovan's several songs, the casting of a puffed-up Diana Dors as the brgermeister's lusty, ill-tempered wife, or the appearance of a weary English pilgrim who is inclined to say things like, ""There's no craftsmanship left these days, no standards. Just greed.""""Z.P.G.,"" initials that stand for zero population growth, is a sometimes funny (unintentionally), untimely meditation on the earth's over-population problems, set in some future smog-bound England where the World Deliberation Council has decreed that for 30 years there shall be no babies born.Women mad for motherhood who refuse to be content with mechanical dolls programmed to say ""Mummy, I love you Mummy,"" take to giving birth in cellars and stealing each other's offspring.Geraldine Chaplin, who has become astonishingly beautiful since ""Dr. Zhivago,"" Oliver Reed and Diane Cilento play the foolish roles without a single snicker.",1972-05-26T05:00:00+0000

Man's peculiar privilege, he writes, is walking erect on two feet (and not on four): and thereby being forced to stretch his hands upwards. to heaven. This conquering of gravity, space and height, as well as of horizon, is essential to violinplaying. We may be reminded of Pangloss, who taught Candide that the existence of eyeglasses could be explained by the fact that noses were obviously made to support them. Fortunately, however, Yehudi Menuhin never tries to convince us that fiddleplaying is the beall and endall of creation.

And Leo, who could write a poem falling out of an airplane, dazzled these bushers. I mean, they all worked with the same tools, right? Words, words. They thought that any poem that was not Snowbound was an achievement. Some of them even read Yeats. Scribes together, to the end. I once knew a dumbbell, a pleasant enough guy, but a dumbbell, who insisted that was hard to write good news copy. There was no way to convince him otherwise. I understand his point. Personally, think it's hard to play The Blue Danube, since I can not play a kazoo. So these men thought Leo's poems astounding. To captains however, he was no captain, as the old joke has it. He surrendered, dear. I don't want to get into an essay about these newspapermen, but they all came out of a movie. At any moment, you would expect one of them to say, voice harsh and hoarse from years of straight bourbon, I don't know much about anything like that... I'm just a newspaperman. That old soft shoe. Hemingway had given birth to them, Pegler as midwife. Their basic style formed itself around the weird idea that politicians have complicated human motives for their acts. If they once recognized the fact that politicians have complicated political motives instead, they would have been forced to think, which is very difficult for a journalist, or to employ the imagination, which they have spent their professional lives denying. These are the same men who fall down in adulation of Mailer's journalism, because, in their pin heads, they have some idea that Mailer has brought to his journalism the same mind that they bring to theirs. And then, by some magic, writes them all under the table. What they don't recognize is that Mailer is eating apple pie in his journalism. His artist's gifts brought to bear on these facts and figures. Shooting fish in a barrel. But those gifts, marshaled in assault on their true target, the novel, have not yet triumphed. Mailer in his journalism is Koufax, in his day, against the Columbia varsity. The big, classic breaking curve simply overwhelming.
