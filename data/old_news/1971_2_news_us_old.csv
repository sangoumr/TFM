us,The Screen: 'Say Hello to Yesterday':British Drama of Love Opens at the Paris Jean Simmons Spices Amusing Vignettes,"The rather arid archness of the title, ""Say Hello to Yesterday,"" is the final flavor of a modest, carefully wrought dramathe fleeting 10-hour relationship of a coltish English boy and an older married womanthat should have been a small gem. It misses, as surely as it pursues the right path. Will Jean Simmons ever truly come into her own?Here, as usual, she is consistently interesting and convincing, as a comfortably-off suburbanite who says good-by to her husband and two young children and entrains to London for the day. Enter now a smitten 22-year-old extrovert, played by Leonard Whiting, who brashly stalks her across town with impish exuberance. They finally bed down. They part.There is much to be said for the lean, simple construction of this British film, which moves forward neatly on a straight line, sticks closely to the principals and deftly sprinkles in just the right portion of sideline characters. Beautifully photographed in color, the various London locales have a captivating immediacy.And so does the prospect of the story, under the nimble, low-keyed direction of Alvin Rakoff, who also wrote the screenplay with Peter King. What the picture lacks is central heating and genuine emotional pull, for all its amusing vignettes, perceptive tenderness and bittersweet wrap-up.The picture is simply not moving, even in the bedroom denouement, which is intended as a revelation and which begins exquisitely. Instead, some curiously antiseptic dialogue defines two understandable but not especially appealing people.And the final scene of parting, intended as an ironic heart-tug, is a prolonged business that induces squirming. Indeed, it almost squashes the whole thing flat, as a bleating vocalist and some soppy lyrics take over the rhythmical theme by Riz Ortolani. Worse, young Whiting, capering off like a giraffe, is stickily entangled with a bunch of balloons.Even so, the open-faced zest of the actor (the most recent ""Romeo"") as the whimsical, free-wheeling young mod remains more intriguing than the rather glacial-souled matron professionally limned by Miss Simmons. More appealing than either, and downright delicious, is that seasoned old-timer, Evelyn Laye, as Miss Simmons's knowing mother.",1971-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Schaefer's 'Doctors' Wives':Dyan Cannon Portrays Unfaithful Spouse 4 Other Features Bow in Local Showings,"""Doctors' Wives have everything. Except husbands."" This is what it says on a placard outside the Loew's State 2, but it isn't exactly true. For example, inside the Loew's State 2 there is a new movie in which doctors' wives have everything including husbands. And one doctor's wife has all the doctors' wives' husbands, except possibly her own, and she has another doctor's wife as well.It is last, this super-doctor's wife (Dyan Cannon) whose infideity of the afternoon is the occasion, but not the cause, of her husband's (John Colicos) shooting her dead in bed and with the same bullet almost killing the doctor who happens to be with her. Immediately all the other doctor's wives (by luck, listening to the same news broadcast at the country club bar or wherever their desires have taken them) fall to wondering whose husband it might be now in emergency in the hospital where practice the doctors who pool their specialties and their wives.If this seems to you a reasonable way to begin a movie (as it surely does to me), then George Schaefer's ""Doctors' Wives,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's State 2 and the Loew's Cine, may promise pleasure enough for an afternoon escape or an evening away from the family. Actually, George Schaefer's contribution should not be ignored, for he builds some very creditable suspense in places, efficiently shepherds his cast through what can only have been for them sustained embarrassment, and manages almost too successfully to minimize the nonsense in a cinema the first principle of which is the shock cut between operating room and bedroom.With one of those community behavior-pattern plots that succeeds by grace of never having to follow any one disaster for too long, ""Doctors' Wives"" often forfeits logic completely. But what it lacks in, say, motivation, it more than makes up in open-heart surgery. And at the last, who will not thrill as John Colicos races against time to beat a murder rap while in the midst of a delicate brain operation to save the life of the little son of chief nurse Diana Sands, mistress of surgeon Richard Crenna, whose wife, Janice Rule, has just become hooked on morphine (which in her caseone in a hundredis an aphrodisiac) in order to alleviate her pesky migraines?More fun to think about than to sit through, ""Doctors' Wives"" is yet never as awful as it ought to be. Where it does go wrong it fails mainly in moral energyfor there is surely something missing in a world in which all do evil and yet everybody is a good guy except Dyan Cannon and John Colicos, who immediately get theirs.There is also something vaguely discomforting in the cast, in which the men are more memorable than the women. I would except Janice Rule and Marian McCargo, two very classy girls. Their coolness seems more in keeping with the director's sensibility than all the others' warmth or silliness or sexinessfor whom we can only, in the words of the advertising copy, forgive them their trespasses.",1971-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Vampire Story With a New Angle Appears at the Penthouse,"Despite a seeming affinity between titles, ""The Vampire Lovers"" is the only innovative dish in the double helping of horrors served up yesterday at the Penthouse Theater. The other course, a largely tasteless concoction called, ""Cult of the Damned,"" is a diffuse variant on a generation gap theme that eventually leaves more gaps than is necessary. But ""The Vampire Lovers,"" praise be, does manage to be a departure from a hackneyed, bloody norm. It also is professionally directed, opulently staged and sexy to boot.The Women's Lib movement notwithstanding, Roy Ward Baker, the director of the British-made ""Vampire Lovers,"" and his writers, have had the diverting temerity to present their chief vampire as a photogenic temptress with distinct Lesbian drives. Perhaps this isn't a precedent, but it's certainly one of the first moves to modernize the ghoul business since the late Bela Lugosi began baring his outsized incisors for cinastes ages ago.""The Vampire Lovers"" is not a complete switch on the genre. The evil mixture is generally the same as before. This time, we're in early 19th-century Styria. Carmilla, the beauteous, last descendant of the undead Karnstein nobility, turns up to start making eyes and passes at Laura, heiress of the rich general. Naturally, Laura finally expires from this supercharged affection, even with a pining fianc around. Then, still bloodthirsty, there's a new campaign with Emma, daughter of another member of the landed gentry, and so it goes until the inevitable vampire expert shows up to drive that stake into the heart of our insatiable vampire.Ingrid Pitt is a vampire to delight any red-blooded Peeping Tom, despite her German-accented English. Sure, she also entices and destroys a couple of guys, but only because they're in her way en route to those gorgeous girls. Miss Pitt, specifically, is a luscious brunette, who is exposed in a nude scene and who prowls about the rest of the time in a diaphanous shift that leaves little to the imagination. And her willing victimsPippa Steele, Madeleine Smith and Kate O'Mara, as Miss Smith's governessare just as nobly endowed. Vampirism, which has become a silly business on screen, is, at least, easy on the eyes in this case.Little is easy on the eyes or ears in ""Cult of the Damned."" Holly Near, as the plump daughter of Jennifer Jones and millionaire Charles Aidman, has trouble respecting her parents. Matters aren't helped when she becomes involved with Jordan and his group. And they're further confused when Christopher entices mama and, in the end, is eying papa. It's disjointed fare, despite a plethora of anti-Establishment remarks, that leaves little impact even on a willing viewer.Miss Jones, properly harried, says, at one point;"" You're all insane.""It sounded logical at the moment.",1971-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Michael Gordon Directs a Domestic 'How Do I Love Thee?',"""How Do I Love Thee?"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is the kind of movie that some years ago, whether good or bad, would have been made with a measure of care and affection. Some traces of affection remain, at least in a few of the characterizations, but for all the care that has been expended, this might as well have been the first run-through of a television pilot with a lot of polishing still to be done before presenting itself for oblivion.Readers and nonreaders alike will recognize the source of the titlewhich will put them one up on most of the cast (newspapermen, college teachers, and the like), upon whose ignorance of that sonnet's authorship the plot more or less depends.The film's situation, which is different from and rather more important than its plot, is another matter. Essentially, it concerns a relationship between father and son (Jackie Gleason and Rick Lenz) that might in a better movie prove both touching and complicated and that even here suggests the material of a domestic comedy that sees domesticity not as a sour joke but rather as a way of living.Gleason plays a Miami small businessman, a mover, a self-educated athiest who battles for the mind and spirit of his son, Tom (after Tom Paine), with a wife (Maureen O'Hara) whose devotion to the godhead seems to encompass several major orthodoxies and some splinter sects as well.Set mostly as a flashback of Tom's, the film includes various family crises, his father's mature dalliance (Shelly Winters), his own marriage (Rosemary Forsyth), his studies and his eventual appointment as chairman of the philosophy department at what has to be the worst college in America.But all these ordinary, and rather traditionally cinematic, and by no means disreputable sweet memories become in ""How Do I Love Thee?"" a collection of routine skits, which Michael Gordon seems mostly to have abstained from directing. I have never before been quite so conscious of watching professional actors so sadly at a loss, at any given moment, for what to do next.If only for a lot of other movies in her career, I must nevertheless praise the beautiful Maureen O'Hara. And Jackie Gleason, despite far too rich a sun tan and the suggestion of too much good living for this partwhen called upon to move a piano, he moves a piano. And there is something to be said for truth even at that level.",1971-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"On Third 'Julius Caesar' Filming: Et tu, Jason Robards et al!","""Ye gods! Must I endure all this?"" understandably bellows Cassius (Richard Johnson) in the last lap of the third filming of William Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar,"" which opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater. Made in England and Spain and in color, with a perfectly viable cast headed by Jason Robards and Charlton Heston, the new picture is generally as flat and juiceless as a dead haddock. In this third go-round, Willie and Julius, both, really get the business.It's Shakespeare all right, at least in dialogue. Dramaturgically, the blueprint adheres to the Hollywood version back in 1953. That solid, intelligent treatment may have lacked majesty but it did have two fire-and-ice performances by John Gielgud as Cassius and Marlon Brando as Mark Antony. And the tormented soul of the real hero, Brutus (James Mason), was sufficiently and touchingly bared.Then there was an even earlier ""Julius Caesar"" from Chicago, of all places, with a newcomer named Charlton Heston as Antony, which he repeats here. The movie did have a raw, shoestring vigor and a bit more.The new movie moves sluggishly, as directed by Stuart Burge. As the center of the whole thing, Robards is incredibly dull and wooden as Brutus, the ""noblest Roman of them all."" Heston supplies laconic bite and delivers a good, ferocious funeral oration. For all his professionalism, Gielgud's Caesar is just an old shrewdie who yields to his ego.In Sir John's former Cassius slot, Johnson looks anything but ""lean and hungry,"" with a bearded sneer, contrasting Robert Vaughn's bland, eye-rolling Casca.

Eisenhower was held in high esteem for the rest of his life, but throughout most of the sixties those amateurs who sit in more or less professional judgment on Presidentsother politicians, his torians, journalistscame more and more into agreement that his eight years in the White House had been a period of meager accomplishment and lackadaisical leadership.

Despite the exodus, when the ice melted late in the month, many greenwinged teal remained, dipping yellow rumps upfor food along the edges of the ponds. Coots wad dled on the shore and pecked in the grass. In the lee of tall brown reeds, hundreds of canvasback ducks rested, bills tucked into their back feathers. A squadron of five snowy egrets played a graceful avian leapfrog, each bird trying to precede the others as they chased minnows in the shal lows.

us,' Little Murders' Is Back As Film Arkin Directed,"Almost everyone must know the history of Jules Feiffer's ""Little Murders,"" how it opened on Broadway in 1967, closed within a week, played successfully in London, and then reopened in 1969 to high praise and a long run for an Off Broadway production staged by Alan Arkin. I assume that everybody also knows the story of ""Little Murders,"" of how Alfred the apathist marries Patsy the optimist and how she is shot dead on their wedding night, thus freeing him to find salvation in the arms and with the armaments of her perfectly mad average-American upper-middle-class New York family.It is, of course, a comedy, of a sort and of a quality that repetition does not ruin. I never saw the play, but I read it after seeing the movie twice, and I still found it funny and movingsomewhat funnier and very much more moving than the film version, also directed by Alan Arkin, which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater.I suspect that ""Little Murders"" (the play) has always been better drama and lesser social satire than most of its detractors or its champions have been prepared to admit. Feiffer is such a brilliantly accurate cartoonist that there has been a tendency to read ""Little Murders"" as animated cartoon rather than to accept the quite extraordinary theatricality of his drama of dark domestic comedy and maniacal declamation. There is a cartoon quality in the film, but it is special to the film, and it seems to result less from a habit of mind than from a failure in imagination.In a rather old-fashioned sense. Arkin has opened up the playas if to make it into cinemaso that while there are now many sequences that could not have occurred on stage, there are also several that need not occur on screen. Patsy's pursuit of Alfred (a weekend at the Concord); Alfred's return to Chicago, where his mom and dad, a pair of aging automatic intellectuals, sound like rejects for a succession of Feiffer panels; the wedding arrangements; above all, Alfred's brushes with the world after Patsy's murderall serve to rearrange the priorities and sometimes embarrassingly expose the deficiencies of ""Little Murders.""Especially the character of Alfred (quite beautifully played, against difficult odds, by Elliott Gould) the photographer who understands the world as excrement and chooses not to fight back when attacked, is made to develop by visual rather than intellectual metaphors after his bride's death. So he rides a subway in blood-drenched shirt and takes a walk in Central Park, the motto of which might be ""Only don't connect,"" and he emerges finally as happy assassinas if there were to be an external analogue explaining, if you will, the reasons for the family that slays together.But Feiffer has no real reasons, no recognition of an order behind the disorder that is his film's central subject. Essentially ""Little Murders"" constructs its world from the point of view of someone sitting behind the locked doors of an apartment on the Upper West Sideand so long as it maintains the conditions of that point of view it worksdramatically, cinematically, whatever way you will. Once it breaks with those conditions it becomes unterrifying, unfunny, superficial, inadequate.But ""Little Murders"" usually is funny  in its great harangues and sermons, in its superlative cast, and in Arkin's direct intelligence in handling most of the dramatic moments. I wish there were space to praise everybody in the cast who should be praisedbut perhaps because they are not so well known to movie audiences I should single out Jon Korkes, who plays Patsy Newquist's swish kid brother as if he were an anthology from the last moments of Claire Quilty, and Marcia Rodd as Patsy herself. Small, dark, the very spirit of indomitable New York, she is the film's most interesting casting, and she succeeds better than anyone else in realizing the human value that is sufficiently contained within the two dimensions of her character.",1971-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Benedek's 'The Night Visitor',"As a tense how-was-it-done, ""The Night Visitor"" is an uncommonly fascinating film shot in beautiful color against authentic wintry Swedish and Danish backgrounds. But the English-language import that arrived at the Cinema Rendezvous and R.K.O. twin theaters yesterday, which obviously also was meant as an exploration in depth of murderous, abnormal psychology, is sadly, somewhat less than an incisive probing of the hearts and minds of its driven principals.Laslo Benedek's task of directing a mountingly suspenseful tale is made fairly smooth by the professionalism of such Scandinavian stalwarts as Max Von Sydow, Liv Ullmann and Per Oscarsson and Britain's Trevor Howard. A viewer is caught up at the outset in brooding mystery as the scantily clothed Von Sydow approaches a farmhouse across a snowy landscape, kills two young women and then, just as stealthily, sneaks off into the night.It is not ungallant to note that he has escaped from an asylum to wreak revenge on the people he is convinced framed him into the asylum on false charges of murder. It also is fair to indicate that his victims are his sister, Hanne Bork and his girl, Lottie Freddie. And, it's right to note that he makes a second, vengeful sortie to eliminate a lawyer, Rupert Davies, another sister, Liv Ullmann, and implicate her frantic doctor-husband, Per Oscarsson, before detective inspector Trevor Howard arrives at a surprising denouncement.However, the motivations for all the machinations and Gothic horrors are merely touched on and hinted at but not made especially convincing in the convoluted goings-on. But the methods of madness are the thing here. The classic enigma of the locked cell and how our designing killer manages to escape and return to it in that towering, fortress-like asylum does make for gripping melodrama.Under Laslo Benedek's workmanlike direction, an observer is soon aware that his cast is properly reacting to varied stresses but that Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann are not involved in trenchant, philosophical upheavals as they've previously been in Ingmar Bergman's ""Shame"" and ""Hour of the Wolf."" But they, as well as Per Oscarsson and Trevor Howard give taut but controlled performances that underline the tensions that make ""The Night Visitor"" a captivating, moody and scenic thriller.",1971-02-11T05:00:00+0000

The family quartet from Pittsburgh, including Steve Forrest, Vera Miles, young Ronny Howard and little Clint Howard, are winning folks of estimable character and grit.Under Robert Totten's able direction, the gentle, warm tone of the story is seasoned with some healthy, unflinching realism, most of it pegged to a maniacally mean neighbor. Typical are the wondering expressions of the two boys when exposed, with the audience, to the foaling of a mare.The neatly sensible screenplay is further enhanced by a few sideline performances, especially Jack Elam as a burly family friend. All told, the picture is hard to resist on its own plain, simple terms, doggedly concerned with such matters as family love, true grit and legal justice. The Disney people, like the ones we see here, have something.",1971-02-11T05:00:00+0000

I'd been those things, but I'd also been a fine pitcherone of the best. The event that stimulated those thoughts, which are from Satchel Paige's 1961 autobiography, May be I'll Pitch Forever, was his promotion in 1948 to the major leagues.

Perhaps ""Irma"" needs help at this point but this addlepated distant cousin of James Bond. Our Man Flint and Bulldog Drummond only serves to make an oldie like ""Irma"" look fairly new.Richard Johnson, the glum Drummond of this mishmash of an intrigue (he also was Drummond in ""Deadlier Than the Male"" in 1967) is called on to save Britain's supersonic airliner from that scientific dastard James Villiers, his well-stacked aides led by Daliah Lavi and Beba Loncar, and their destructive ""infrasonic"" gadget.The fact that he swats would-be killers like flies, parachutes to safety, drives a super speedboat and avoids the clutches of a succession of delectable dolls like Sydne Rome simply proves that an imitative spoof not only can be unfunny but also boring.

us,"British Thriller, 'Sudden Terror,' Bows","""Sudden Terror,"" a new British thriller, is an exasperating model of how not to film the fable of the boy who cried wolf, with a killer in hot pursuit and nobody heeding. What ever happened to British restraint? The tone of the film is even more hysterical than the boy, young Mark Lester of ""Oliver!"" fame.Under John Hough's direction, the picture raucously careens after the sprinting lad, with the nervous color camera all but doing a back flip, plus a blaring score of eerie sounds and spookier rock 'n' roll. Worst of all, the screenplay continually cuts from the boy and his plight to some singularly dull adults, including Lionel Jeffries as his arch grandfather and Susan George and Tony Bonner as a two humdrum young mods. The twitching police inspector, Jeremy Kemp, who needs a psychiatrist himself, is as repulsive as the killer, Peter Vaughan.The picture almost zestfully reaps a harvest of corpses along the way. We counted eight. Exactly one, the first, would have sufficed. Not a note of music was needed.However, the island background of Malta (unspecified) comes over beautifully and intriguingly as the film careens across it. And the graphic opening of the assassination of a visiting President, who rates hardly a backward glance, is truly gripping.Remember Hollywood's 1949 version of the boy who cried wolf called ""The Window""?

us,Screen: Bronte Revival:Scenes Glitter Anew in 'Wuthering Heights',"There are recurring moments in the new British film version of ""Wuthering Heights"" when it's possible to comprehend something of the nature of the wild and beautiful physical environment out of which Emily Bront, almost 125 years ago, created her unique novel of transcendental love and hate, of venegeful marriages and of awful deeds that often, as in the hanging of a litter of puppies, were directed toward the innocent.If you squint your eyes, and look around and beyond the actors carrying on in the middle of the screen, mostly as if they were on a hysterical picnic, you can get some sense of the magnificence of the Yorkshire moors, which have been photographed in all sorts of weather and in all sorts of light. There is also that feeling of connections to a primeval past in the architecture of the ancient farm buildings at Wuthering Heights, which seem to have erupted out of glacier rock, rather than to have been built by man.Such peripheral things describe Miss Bront's marvelous and demented Heathcliff and Cathy in ways that are quite beyond the capabilities of the movie's principal performers. This ""Wuthering Heights,"" which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, is simply petulant when it tries to be overwrought, which may be what American International Pictures publicity people mean when they describe the film as ""youth-oriented.""As did the lovely 1939 film version, which was directed by William Wyler and written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, this adaptation confines itself entirely to the first half of the novel, beginning with the introduction of the mysterious gypsy boy, Heathcliff, into the Earnshaw household, and concluding a half-generation later when the see-through shade of Heathcliff is finally reunited with the see-through shade of Cathy at Pennistone Crag.Because Miss Bront's ""Wuthering Heights"" defies easy or consistent interpretation, even in an age illuminated by Freud, Robert Feust, the director, and Patrick Tilley, who did the adaptation, have felt free to make bluntly clear relationships that in the novel remain forever ambiguous. Thus there is no doubt in this ""Wuthering Heights"" that Heathcliff and Cathy are half-brother and half-sister.The shape of the film is similarly straightforward, a chronicle spanning 10 or 12 years, although the effect of the chronicle is more than a little confusing because the characters all seem to grow up at different rates of speed, and seldom does a child actor have much physical relation to the adult actor who takes on his character later in the film.This would be nit-picking in a movie that was otherwise touched with any kind of cinematic grace or intelligence, both totally absent from the decisions made by Fuest and Tilley. The screenwriter, who often uses bits of dialogue from the novel, doesn't hesitate to add new material that is completely inappropriate. Cathy exclaims, when her brother Hindley is having a drunken card game at Wuthering Heights: ""He's just got to get those dreadful people out of the house!""a line that would do credit only to the Johnny Carson Art Players.Even more amusing, and less impressive, are Fuest's different ways of creating mystery (frame Heathcliff in a doorway as a dark silhouette), suspense (a stranger enters a scene shot from the knees down, more or less feet-first), debauchery (close-up of an overturned tankard). It is some kind of reverse triumph that under his direction a rock formation on the moors looks less symbolic, or even phallic, thanwellsuggestive.Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall play the star-crossed lovers in degrees of effectiveness that depend largely on camera angles. Dalton, under certain conditions, bears a remarkable resemblance to the young Laurence Olivier for whom the Wyler version was a triumph. Miss Calder-Marshall is not a great beauty, but her face at times expresses an almost witchlike ferocity, which is, more often than not, immediately neutralized by a long shot that reveals a short, rather square figure, somewhat reminiscent of Annette Funicello's.The supporting cast includes some very decent character actors (Harry Andrews, Hugh Griffith), most of whom, like the babies born of the mismatched marriages, die at unspecified times off-screen.Contemporary history note: This ""Wuthering Heights"" apparently marks a revival of film interest in the Bronts. I've just received word that Richard Fleischer (""Ch!"") plans a biographical film about the writing family in which Bramwell Bront will be portrayed as ""one of the original dropouts"" in a script by Christopher Fry.",1971-02-19T05:00:00+0000

Misused, they are mere chic decorations, like the fairies and elves of oldfashioned children's books, which borrowed their trap pings from folklore rather than from the physics laboratory.

us,The Screen: An Almost Perfect 'Claire's Knee',"Eric Rohmer's ""Claire's Knee,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, comes very close to being a perfect movie of its kind, something on the order of an affectionate comedy of the intellect that has no easily identifiable cinema antecedents except in other films by Mr. Rohmer, most notably ""My Night at Maud's.""It is the product of a literary sensibility, and it grows out of a literary tradition, but it is, first and foremost, a superlative motion picture. Like ""Intolerance,"" ""My Darling Clementine,"" ""Rear Window"" and ""Le Gai Savoir""movies I mention only because it resembles them not in the least""Claire's Knee"" could exist in no other form.The film is the fifth in Rohmer's projected cycle of ""Six Moral Tales,"" each of which is designed as a variation on the theme of the man who, in love with one woman, feels drawn to another, whom he finally rejects in order to pursue the first, whom he may or may not win. Carlos Clarens, writing in Sight and Sound, has called this official schema ""a snare for professional film decoders,"" and I agree.The joys in Rohmer's Moral Tales exist not so much in the variations he works, nor in contrasting one film with another, but in responding to the various levels of experience contained within each film. Of the three Moral Tales I've now seen, including ""Maud"" (the third) and ""La Collectionneuse"" (the fourth), which has not yet been released here, ""Claire's Knee"" is by far the most fascinating. It is both more easily accessible than ""Maud,"" and more complex, less of a conventional narrative and more of an emotional experience.The setting is near Annecy in western France, not far from the Swiss border, a lovely, slightly out-of-fashion summer community that faces the overwhelming Alps across the Lake of Annecy. The time of the film is most exact: it opens on Monday, the 29th of June, and closes on Wednesday, the 29th of July. Among other things, the movie is all about the disciplines by which civilized man maintains his sanity, including the concept of time.Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy), a diplomat in his thirties, engaged to Lucinda whom he will join in Stockholm shortly, has come to Annecy to sell the villa where he spent his vacations as a boy. There by chance he meets an old friend, Aurora (Aurora Cornu), a beautiful, wise, amused novelist, with whom he's always been somewhat in love, and the two teen-age daughters, Laura (Beatrice Romand) and Claire (Laurence De Monaghan) of the family Aurora is staying with.Both Aurora and Jerome are, as they say, ""in transit""their real lives are elsewhere. Out of curiosity, and to amuse Aurora, who says she needs inspiration for a story, Jerome allows himself to become drawn to 16-year-old Laura, who, according to Aurora, is in love with him. Suddenly, however, he finds himself full of desire for the somewhat older Claire, specifically for her right knee, that ""magnet"" of his desire that, in another woman, might be located in the nape of the neck, the waist or the hands.If ""Claire's Knee"" can be said to have a story, it would relate, I suppose, to how Jerome succeeds, for one brief moment, in possessing Claire's knee. Through plot permutations I need not go into, Jerome's gesture of desire is accepted as one of consolation.""Claire's Knee"" unfolds like an elegant fairy tale in a series of enchanted and enchanting encounters, on the lake, in gardens heavy with blossoms, in interiors that look like Vermeers. Everything in this world has sharply defined edges, like the lake, which is not bordered by beach but by a manmade quay.Jerome, Aurora and Laura live according to sharply defined rules of behavior. Although they may seem romantic in that their conversation is mostly of love and friendship, this is, of course, a human activity of the most refined sort. When they explore their own emotions, test their feelings and exercise aspects of their will, it is a sport for esthetes. For them, in spite of all their talk about being bored with love and suffocated by beauty, each polite meeting becomes as fraught with suspense and danger as a confrontation of gladiators.Beneath this surface level, ""Claire's Knee"" is also about self-deception, about cruelty, about a certain kind of arrogance that goes with wisdom, and very much about sex. It is no accident that the beautiful, lean, comparatively stupid Claire, for whom Jerome conceives his ""pure desire,"" is the only person in the movie enjoying, at the moment, a completely satisfactory, uninhibited sex life.The film is as physically lovely as any I've seen in years, and the performances are of such variety and wit that they should remove forever the notion that Rohmer, with his literary sensibility, is not essentially a filmmaker. Everyone is fine, but I have special feeling for Miss Romand, who grows up in such mysterious and wonderful ways in front of the camera, and for Miss Cornu, a novelist and poet in real life, who comes close to being a total woman.""Claire's Knee"" is a difficult film to do justice to without over-selling it. It is so funny and so moving, so immaculately realized, that almost any ordinary attempt to describe it must, I think, in some way diminish it.",1971-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 9 Film Portraits at Whitney,"Taken all together, the Nine Film Portraits that make up the current program (through tomorrow) of the Whitney Museum's New American Filmmakers Series, suggest not so much a unity as a small corner on the variety of approaches available to the idea of portraiture in film.Among the nine, only one, Ralph Arlyck's ""Sean,"" is a portrait in the more or less conventional, documentary-interview sense we have come to expect on film. And the subject isn't so conventional  a casually charming 4-year-old who smokes grass (which he would rather chew) and, a child of his time, thinks the police are ""icky.""On the other hand, there are a few ""portraits"" in a purely visual, quite rigorously formal sense. Mike Kuchar's ""Variations"" examines moving heads in a series of variously colored monochromatic negative prints. And Hollis Frampton's long (25 minutes) silent, black-and-gray ""Manual of Arms"" first bisects faces and then reveals whole people in intermittent flashes from what appears to be a single light source. I didn't much like the Kuchar exercise, and the strict economies of ""Manual of Arms"" after a short while get to look like nothing so much as arbitrary excess.But ""Originatetransfiguratedisintegrate,"" by Dennis Kugler and John Schnele, is a formal portrait, showing animated photographic images in one stage of chemical decay or another, of feverish vitality that really does seem to favor the medium. And I suppose, all other things being equal (they are not) I should have to call it the best film of the show.Niel White's ""Putting the Babies Back, Part II,"" has been reviewed here recently. It does not improve with second viewing. I cannot imagine a second viewing for Bruce Baillie's inexpressive program of close-ups in ""Valentin de las Sierras"" or for Gary Galsworth's opportunistic study of a found object, an old tattooed man named ""Blacky."" At the other end of the scale, Leonard Lipton's lovely home movie ""People,"" in its affection for valuable inconsequential gesture, indicates in the course of its three minutes why there has to be a continuing alternative to the commercial cinema.Nothing of the kind is indicated by Ken Schneider's ""Chicken Soup,"" which was, however, if only for its malice aforethought my favorite among the Nine Film Portraits.Dealing with the complete home prepartion of ""a delicious Jewish chicken soup"" from killing the chicken to slurping the soup, Schneider's film treats its subject in a manner that might best be described as affectionate revulsion. For those of us who, after a childhood of Sunday suffering, contemplate chicken soup with rather less equanimity than Socrates brought to the hemlock, Schneider says it allor almost all. There should be a sequel on matzoh balls.Nine Film Portraits is the last of the Whitney's current program, which though uneven, have nevertheless furnished welcome exception to a mostly dull New York movie season. They have included some very exciting and ambitious new work, such as Beverly Conrad's ""Coming Attractions"" and Arakawa's ""Why Not.""And the programing, even of bad movies, seems always to have worked from interesting premises. For this, I believe credit is due to the series director, David Bienstock, and, for the general efficiency of the series, to his associates, Bruce Rubin and Deborah Freedman. Projection at the Whitney has been exceptionally conscientious. I don't know whom to thank for that, but I am grateful.",1971-02-23T05:00:00+0000

With the best will in the world, one ends judging poems in English, and their faults and virtues may be those of the translator rather than of the original pogt. Yet this bulky, cumbersome, though continually revealing collec tion of materials by and about Mayakovsky has an interest above and beyond that provoked by the quality of his work. In fact, the nature of his lit erary achievement is virtually ignored in the book. One can get a better idea of the texture of his writing from the introduc tory essay by Patricia Blake in The Bedbug and Selected Poems, just reissued by World ($6.95). Mayakovsky's career has an extraliterary fascination. For he experienced in himself the artistic freedom and experimental exuberance of those early years right after the Russian revolution, and he lived long enough to see the shadow of the prison house descend on all artistic endeavor. He saw art lose its autonomy and become a sloganmaking activity, an element in production goals, a cheer leader for the state. He did not have to face the worst of that situation.

us,"Through 'The Body,' With Music","The newspaper ads for ""The Body,"" which feature a picture of a probably nude couple sort of embracing, along with a selection of really high-toned testimonials from M.D.'s, Ph.D.'s and various upper media types, might suggest a certain dichotomy in the minds of the film's distributors as to how to make their product salable. I think the dichotomy derives from the film itself, which touches almost all sensational body bases in a mad, pretentious, mostly futile attempt to hold together birth and death, sex and science, the heart, the lungs, the liver and the large intestine. It opened yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, and it is an aggressively awful movie.At the center of ""The Body"" sits a cast, unidentified, but more or less a cross-section of bodies of various ages and sexes and types, mostly dressed in terrycloth bathrobes and mostly occupied in holding serious impromptu discussions and in sensitizing one another. Around the edges of ""The Body"" are convalescent hospitals, a couple making love, various polluted rivers, a few plastic models showing internal organs and several living, palpitating internal organs themselves  photographed from the inside.""The Body"" makes rather a thing of taking its audience places they have never been and may very well never wish to go. Thus, you may accompany a mouthful of air down the esophagus and follow a bit of lunch through the large intestine. My favorite of these adventures among the vital functions is the passing of urine into the bladderwhich is backed by some unusually deep rapture-of-the-deep music, as if it were all part of the Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. Which is what you might expect from a movie that places a string quartet behind its red corpuscles, and over the figures of its love-making couple has the voices of Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Finlay stage-whisper: ""What is it men in women do require? The lineaments of gratified desire . . .""The practice of never leaving well enough alone is raised to an esthetic principle in ""The Body,"" and this in large measure accounts for the film's special offensiveness. It might be possible to grant the good intentions of the film-makers (not really), but never their good judgment. They have made a massive effort to balance youth and age, pain and pleasure, natural childbirth and equally natural senility. And yet ""The Body"" is always out of balance, precious, disproportionate, grotesquelike a vain attempt at humanistic harmony by some opportunistic offshoot of the gothic imagination.",1971-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Argentine Epic,"""La Hora de Los Hornos"" (The Hour of the Furnaces) is a three-part, four-hour and 20-minute, political documentary film, directed (as well as photographed and written in part) by Fernando Ezequiel Solanas, a young Argentine filmmaker who has committed himself to the cause of violent revolution as the only means to true liberation and the establishment of a national Argentine consciousness. On the basis of the 90-minute Part One, subtitled ""Neocolonialism and Violence,"" the work might well turn out to be a polemical epic, an essay film of a political, cinematic and psychological complexity unlike anything I've ever seen.For reasons I do not know, Solanas has allowed only Part One to be released for commercial distribution here, although the entire film has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and is available for 16 mm. showings by film societies, universities and such. It has also been widely screened in Europe but, understandably, only privately in Argentina.Part One opened here yesterday at the New Yorker Theater on a program with Joseph Strick's 22-minute ""Interviews with Mylai Veterans,"" which has been nominated for an Academy Award. As its title implies, the film is a series of interviews with five enlisted men who participated in the Mylai action and all of whom are now out of the Army. The effect of the testimonyrueful, matter-of-fact, unsentimental, a lot of it smiling (at the interviewer and at the fact of being interviewed, rather than at the subject)is terrifying, and almost indescribably sad.Because no movie genre makes quite as personal demands on the viewer as the political documentary, or plays on his prejudices with such accuracy, perhaps I should explain something of my own experiences, which, of course, I took with me when I entered the theater to see ""The Hour of the Furnaces."" I'm no student of either Argentina or Latin America, and just about everything I know of them is the more or less chance result of several short visits to Argentina in the early 1960's.First of all there was, for me, each time I arrived in Buenos Aires international airport, the feeling that I'd arrived at the end of the line, if not the world. Although the airport services the largest city in South America, and is modern and efficient and handsome, it seemsas Solanas says of Buenos Aires itselfto have ""turned its back on the country."" It faces north and east and west, but not south, and if one had wanted to go to Tierra del Fuego, or even Crdoba, one had to go to another airport.Seen from the perspective of either British Empire or United States hegemony, Argentina is, quite literally, as far away as you can get, the last stop before the South Pole, a fact that has shaped a kind of national inferiority complexpolitical, cultural and economic. It has set out to demonstrate that being Argentine, as well as Latin American, can be beautiful.""La Hora de Los Homos,"" Part One, is a cool but furious examination of first the British and then the American neocolonialism that, according to Solanas, had as its aim the ""Balkanization"" of Latin America for economic exploitation. Here is no unbiased report, but a vivid, angry, indoctrination lesson, sometimes crude but always cinematic, that has the look of the kind of documentary film Godard might make if he opted to play on the bourgeois emotions he now scorns.The film employs old prints, newsreels and interviews, as well as clips from the work of Joris Ivens and Fernando Birri (the only other young Argentine filmmaker I know who shares, with Solanas, an authentic Argentine vision), On the soundtrack there are lengthy quotations from Sartre and Fanon, slogans, and masses of facts, none of which I can easily authenticate.Some of Solanas's juxtapositions are so obvious they are unworthy of the quality of the passion of the film that contains them. Mostly, however, the images, the editing and the sound track are fine, even witty, as in the section on the Argentine aristocracy, defined by its grandiose cemetery that looks like Washington's Resurrection City, sculptured in marble. The aristocrats, he notes, ""take the past as [if it were] a future.""I find difficult (and depressing) Solanas's conclusions in favor of Pernism, which he describes as the first popular expression of Argentina's national consciousness, and suspect that, in the style of other contemporary revolutionaries, he may well feel that the past can be rewritten, through re-evaluation, according to the needs of the present. Solanas's conclusions thus escape me; his arguments do not.""La Hora de Los Hornos,"" Part One, is, most importantly, a unique film exploration of a nation's soul. It's full of tremendous vigor, unlike the tired Buenos Aires dinner party at which the hostess, before introducing me, gave me quick sketches of everyone in the room. ""Over there,"" she said, pointing to a handsome, morose man, who seemed to be getting quite drunk, ""is Jos. . . . Poor Jos. He always wanted to be the Minister of War. In the last regime, he wasfor three weeks. Now he has nothing to look forward to.""",1971-02-26T05:00:00+0000

But by midafternoon crowds began to mass in Unity Flats, another Catholic area.Soldiers sealed off the area to prevent clashes with the Protestants, but some bottles were hurled over the soldiers heads at the football crowd. The Catholics chanted Ardoyne, Ardoyne, a reminder of the killings last night. Protestants replied with songs before police hustled them away.Soon afterwards, the Cath olics rushed the British troops, and water cannons were called in to beat back stonethrowing mobs. The trouble lasted about an hour and is believed to have been provoked by extrem ists of the Irish Republican Army.A breakaway group called Provisionals hopes that by in flaming sectarian conflict they can cause Britain to rule Northern Ireland directly from London. Such a development, they believe, might result in a tripartite agreement with the Irish Republic.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tames Chichester Clark cut short a visit to London and returned to Belfast.Intensive arms searches were carried out during the day in another Catholic, area of Bel fast where a pistol and ammu nition were found in a derelict house. The Government an nounced restrictions on move ment in the city, and the police were issued flak jackets in the troubled areas.The police, who have been unarmed since the fall of 1969, demanded protection. Some have been given guns and others will be accompanied by armed soldiers when on patrol.Eleven persons accused of rioting appeared In court today and were detained. Four geli gnite nail bombs were said to have been found in the pocket of one man.In the incident in which the two policemen were killed by automatic fire, two more po licemen were wounded. The most seriously injured man un derwent an operation for re moval of a bullet from his chest.Soldiers said that when re turning the fire they shot two and possibly three of the gun men but the wounded men had been dragged away by their comrades.The killing of the policemen, it is felt here, is bound to sharpen the pressure of the rightwing of the ruling Union ist party against the Prime Minister.",1971-02-28T05:00:00+0000

Where I object most to Novick's comments is his attitude about the sameness of Mil ler's themes.

It's about a boy who finds a construction worker's yellow hat, returns it to the owner and consoles himself by making a new hat from yellow paper. That's all. But Mark Alan Stamaty has drawn a city scene that Hieronymous Bosch would have enjoyed walking through. Surprises are all around. Store windows, people on the street, animals on the curb are labeled with halfhidden, sometimes ironic mes sages. Tiny dream creatures pop up in the most unexpected places.
