us,'THE MOST FAMOUS UNKNOWN IN THE WORLD' -- REMEMBERING DJUNA BARNES,"''YOU have to trust someone, Miss Barnes. Why not trust me?'' Only an author as aggravating as Djuna Barnes could have goaded me into making such a desperate plea, during a meeting in our publishing office. I was unaware I had nearly shouted these words until my assistant, in the outer room, repeated them to me. ''Do you think she trusts you now?'' she asked after Miss Barnes's departure. ''Did it work?'' Of course it didn't work. Nothing worked with Djuna Barnes, whose distrust of all book publishers seemed to be pathological, the product of her long and unhappy history with many companies here and abroad. She even rejected the word ''publishers''; they were ''printers'' to her. She was now almost 70 years old. She took advice only from her longtime friend and admirer T. S. Eliot, who happened to be her English publisher, and he told me that occasionally even his advice was flatly rejected.",1985-12-01T05:00:00+0000

One way in the last few years has been the issuance of tax-exempt housing bonds, which were used to build mixed-income rentals and to increase the affordability of new and exisiting houses and condominiums through below-market mortgages offered by the State of New York Mortgage Agency. Now a new program enacted by the Legislature in its last session is about to put state tax revenues directly to work in the housing field - $50 million initially. When Governor Cuomo signed the bill in April, he said he expected contracts to be signed over a year's time that would bring about the ''rehabilitation and construction of over 3,800 units of housing in New York State.''",1985-12-01T05:00:00+0000

One thinks of Arthur Miller's men, hustlers who lived through one Great Depression and live in fear of another; of Tennessee Williams's women, cut loose with the fall of the plantation aristocracy and thrown into the cruel cities.

Consider the price structure of audio equipment. Down in the low-budget bracket, cost matters most, sometimes tempting designers to cut corners in ways that offend the knowing ear. Upward from there, performance rises with price - up to a point. Then the law of diminishing returns takes hold, and prices rise a lot faster than performance. That way, virtue as defined by cost/performance ratios is squeezed both from top and bottom and therefore concentrates in the middle.

The prospectus will say for whom the investment is suitable: some shelters are set up for people with incomes as low as $30,000. A broker or financial planner can help locate specific offerings. But what types of shelters are really appropriate for the moderate investor, the one willing to put up $5,000, $10,000, even $25,000?",1985-12-01T05:00:00+0000

The author has called it ''history informed by psychoanalysis.'' His initial volume focuses on Victorian sexuality. In 1984 Neil McKendrick commented here that ''this volume will delight the Freudians and serve as a new landmark in historical studies. In spite of - arguably, because of - its highly personal interpretations, it could well become a classic of its kind.'' THE WANDERERS, by Richard Price. (Penguin, $5.95.) The Wanderers are a largely Italian teen-age Bronx housing project gang of the early 1960's; in their unforgiving and violent world they confront adult posturings, sexual myths and realities and various fears. In 1974 our reviewer, Hubert Selby Jr., praised ''The Wanderers'' as an ''outstanding work of art,'' a ''superbly written book about coming of age in a section of the Bronx.''

Several New Zealand publishers had rejected it. They felt the 400-plus-page book about a woman living a hermitlike existence on the South Island beaches who befriends a boy unable to speak and his ornery foster father was too long, unwieldy and lacked the shape of a traditional novel. ''Which is why I was going to embalm the whole thing in a block of perspex,'' Miss Hulme writes in her introduction. To her rescue came three women who formed the Spiral Collective, an ad hoc publishing group, in order to bring out ''The Bone People'' and works by other female writers. Two printings, or 4,000 copies, sold out. It won the 1984 Pegasus Prize (sponsored by Mobil, with an agreement with Louisiana State University Press to publish the winner) and the New Zealand Book Award for 1984. And when it was nominated for the Booker, its British publisher, Hodder & Stoughton, threw a champagne party for everyone on the staff. ''They were very surprised,'' said Miss Hulme.

Few musicians, even the most famous of them, concerned themselves with the problem. Pablo Casals, who was idolized by musicians and the public alike, is supposed to have remarked that all music should be performed as if it were Chopin. By that I suppose he meant look for the lyricism.

The trio returned to the repertory Friday evening, and though it is impossible to hear the third score played as well as it was by the Met orchestra without being newly bewitched, satisfaction was oddly elusive through most of the evening.",1985-12-01T05:00:00+0000

The pivotal question being debated is whether the Roman Catholic bishops should issue a statement of specific proposals to complement a pastoral message. [A1:3-4.] The French and Polish leaders met, generating protests in virtually all French political circles except the Communist Party. The 80-minute meeting between President Francois Mitterrand and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, held at the general's request, was the first in a Western capital between the Polish leader and a Western head of state since Poland declared martial law in 1981. [A1:2.] A Polish priest was bound and beaten a second time this year, according to his mother, Teresa Zaleski. She said that the Rev. Tadeusz Zaleski, who was assaulted earlier this year because of his support for Solidarity, was attacked by three people who then ransacked his home. [A8:4.] Some U.S. anti-hijacking units may be deployed overseas.

''The words are only speculation/ (From the Latin speculum, mirror),'' writes John Ashbery. ''They seek and cannot find the meaning of the music./ We see only postures of the dream.'' The lines are from Mr. Ashbery's dazzling masterwork ''Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror,'' and like so much of his verse, they address not only the situation at hand in a given poem, but also the overall condition of his art - his relation, as a poet, to the reality around him. In this case, the lines also uncannily describe the effect of reading Mr. Ashbery's poetry - an effect not unlike that produced by listening to a piece of avant-garde music. Certainly his elliptical work frequently defies conventional attempts to impute meaning - most are vague about time, place and characters, as though external reality were quite beside the point; many constantly shift point of view, as though the idea of fixed character, too, were outmoded. And yet its meditative, allusive beauty retains a powerful ability to entrance, goading the reader to re-examine his own relationship to the world.",1985-12-07T05:00:00+0000

Many went out of business or merged. Then, as mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies came to dominate the market, the average size of stock exchange transactions ballooned. Large blocks (10,000 shares and up) are half of total exchange volume, up from 5 per cent 20 years ago. A broker able to take a $10-million block of stock off a customer's hands into its own inventory, to distribute at leisure, can get the business away from one that offers to dribble the stock out for the customer over weeks or months. That, however, calls for substantial capital. To get it, some large brokerage houses floated their shares to the public or looked for merger partners.",1985-12-08T05:00:00+0000

As Peter Jennings says on one of the programs, citing an ABC survey of young people, ''Nearly 70 percent consider television news their most important source of information.'' In fact, Mr. Jennings could have gone further. Ever since 1963, according to the Roper Organization, more people, young and otherwise, have said they get their news from television than anywhere else. Television images inform our thinking, but why those particular images? ''Making the News,'' an ABC ''Notebook Special,'' Wednesday afternoon at 4, says they arise from a journalistic collaboration.

us,  GARDENING,"Gardeners have time now to take time out. They can afford the luxury of visiting other people's gardens or visiting them vicariously through beautiful pictures and elegant prose. The richness of this year's garden books could cause a moment or two of visual indigestion, but what does that matter? We have all winter to recover. Besides, such indulgence may teach us a trick or two or provide the inspiration to dig up the whole plot next spring and start all over again. VISIONS OF PARADISE: Themes and Variations on the Garden. Photographs by Marina Schinz. Text by Susan Littlefield. 272 pp. (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $39.95.) This beautiful book captures the textures, colors and even the ideas behind some of the Western world's best-loved gardens. The superb photographs are the work of the Swiss-born photographer Marina Schinz, who collaborated with the American landscape architect and writer Susan Littlefield. ''Clarity of garden style'' was the chief criterion for Miss Schinz as she traveled to California, New York, the District of Columbia, France, Italy and Britain in search of gardens that express a theme or fulfill a practical purpose. She has grouped her extraordinarily lush color photographs under 10 headings, ranging from the humble kitchen and cottage garden to the magnificent villa of Renaissance Italy, with stops along the way at the rose garden, the naturalized garden (a natural habitat with ''light botanical editing'') and that ''ultimate aesthetic achievement in garden design,'' the perennial border.",1985-12-08T05:00:00+0000

A few years ago the ideal photography book was on the order of ''Walker Evans: First and Last'' (1978), which contained not a word of text except for the titles of the pictures. But the rage for having pages of solitary images surrounded by white borders has given way to a craving for personal history, anecdote and analysis. Blame it, if you must, on the success of Patricia Bosworth's chatty 1984 biography of Diane Arbus, which portrays photography at its most Dickensian. Now it is the photojournalists' turn: Robert Capa, Carl Mydans and W. Eugene Smith have all received the literary star treatment (their books were reviewed earlier in these pages). Ansel Adams, who was an entire constellation in his lifetime, has now written his autobiography. Needless to say, some of these photographers' lives warrant our attention more than others.

It took the photographer Hiroji Kubota three years to get permission to photograph in China and seven years and 200,000 clicks of the shutter to collect this fine gathering of 186 color photographs. The pictures reveal China from the time when the current open-door policy was only a narrow slit to the now cavernous entrance provided the West, especially the United States. When historians look back to what may prove to be the most significant change of a national outlook in this century, Mr. Kubota's images will show China just crossing the threshold, just inviting the West in, timidly peeking out. He assigned himself all of China - one billion people, 3.7 million square miles and 55 minority nationalities. The book is especially full of China's minorities; at times the reader forgets the overwhelming majority presence of the Han Chinese, so rich are the photographs of the Kazakhs, the Uighurs, the Tibetans, the Mongolians.

BASEBALL cards have long had a special place in the hearts of fans. Cards have been associated with bubble gum and youngsters since the early 1930's. Before learning to ride a two-wheeler, many children become adept at trading, flipping, matching or simply collecting baseball cards. But as long ago as the 1880's, cards were packaged with cigarettes, not gum, and prized by adults more than children. Indeed, the association of baseball cards with tobacco is responsible for the most valuable card of all, the Honus Wagner, distributed with Sweet Caporal cigarettes in 1910. The great Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop disliked cigarettes so much he insisted that the tobacco company recall and destroy all cards bearing his likeness; as a result, the few 1910 Wagners that remain now command $25,000 in mint condition.",1985-12-08T05:00:00+0000

What was a merry but meandering al fresco entertainment has been turned into an artfully engineered Victorian vehicle. While still giving only a nod to the essential Dickensian spirit and overlooking entirely the darker side of the narrative, the show is unabashed about its divergence from its source. It is ''suggested by'' rather than adapted from Charles Dickens's last and unfinished novel - about the disappearance and probable death of young Edwin Drood. Created in tandem by Rupert Holmes as author, composer and lyricist and Wilford Leach as director, the show pretends that a musicalization of the novel is being performed by a second-rate English acting company. The result is a play within a play, with the audience as active participants in finding a solution to the crime.

Other families got their trees up and strung them with lights a week or two early, and night after night I stood barefoot on the cold bedroom floor, looking out the window, studying other people's happiness. Their Christmas was correct, according to Good Housekeeping magazine, Perry Como's Christmas special and a glossy book that Aunt Marie sent us, called ''Christmas Ideals.'' It featured color photographs of tremendously happy people in fabulous homes resplendent with lights and music and love, in greens and reds as deep and shiny as Jell-O desserts. Standing in the dark, admiring the windows along our street, I imagined how happy those families were as they cheerfully completed the many joyful tasks of the season: baking, decorating, wrapping, singing, dancing, being nice to each other, etc. Our home was more like Little Benny's miserable hovel in ''The Christmas Gruel: A True Story of an Orphan in the East London Slums,'' a gift from my mother. The pictures in that book were drawings - Benny begging for pennies, Benny huddled in a heap of rags in the snow, etc. The book was supposed to make me grateful for my blessings, I guess, but to me, it was autobiography.",1985-12-08T05:00:00+0000

These machines preserve the wine after the bottle is opened by placing a layer of nitrogen gas over the surface of the liquid. The most common of these devices has up to eight spigots connected to long tubes that are inserted into wine bottles; the bottles, in turn, are sealed in an airtight box. When the spigot is turned on, wine comes out through the tube and nitrogen fills the space left in the bottle. Without oxygen in the bottle, the wine stays fresh for days. This is particularly useful with older red wines that oxidize quickly after they are opened as well as with fragile whites.

Weisberger's ''Statue of Liberty,'' based on a French version of the book by Christian Blanchet and Bertrand Dard, may well be one of the best in its treatment of the statue itself. As much picture as it is text, it offers a bright biography of this extraordinary figure, conceived during a dinner party by a group of influential republicans, as a gift of France in the name of liberty. We learn about its construction according to the most modern techniques applied by Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, who created a genuine modern colossus. Although it was in a classic, old mold that many felt lacked artistic innovative genius, it has seized the imagination of the world. The story tells of the fund-raising, the commercialism, the idealism, the subsequent neglect that surrounded the statue during the 100 years since it was erected.",1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000

''How did Lear acquire the power that, as an old man, he abuses with such disastrous effects? Without knowing his past, I've never really understood the ferocity of his daughters' response to Lear's feeble attempts to shed his royal power. In 'Ran' I've tried to give Lear a history. I try to make clear that his power must rest upon a lifetime of bloodthirsty savagery. Forced to confront the consequences of his misdeeds, he is driven mad.

Most of the anthology was to comprise original productions, but these were to be supplemented with licensed recordings, where pertinent or historically desirable.

us,"TEETH, WONDER WOMAN AND THE SOUL OF BALI","THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY. Introduced by David M. Wilson. (Knopf, $75.) Whoever designed the Bayeux tapestry nine centuries ago was one of the greatest narrators ever to tell a story. In pictures and words this embroidered linen strip 20 inches high and 230 feet long tells the story of the conquest of England by William of Normandy in 1066 so gracefully and clearly that few accounts of any historical event can match the swiftness of its narrative or its power over one's emotions. As a viewer watches the story unfold, the rich and tumultuous life of 11th-century nobles and their armies fills the imagination and when the Battle of Hastings finally comes into view the action becomes startlingly dramatic. The epic elevation and dignity of this great work lift the spirit; vanquished and conquerors alike move with energy one can feel across the centuries, they fight without treachery and their nobility endows the final battle with tragic grandeur. Brilliant photographs made several years ago when the tapestry was removed from its casing in its Bayeux museum for cleaning have been assembled in 146 consecutive pages by Sir David Wilson in a magnificent book that displays the tapestry in greater clarity, at times, than one can see it in the museum. Sir David, the director of the British Museum, also provides clear, brief commentaries on the events depicted in the tapestry as well as on the people and action in each picture.

Balinese arts have been illustrated in large-size books throughout our century, but never has a particular visual creation from Bali been more beautifully captured than in this stunning volume. Classic court paintings there portrayed gods, heroes, demons and comic servants. The paintings were stored and then shown on occasions determined by taboos that helped regulate the iconography's power. One exception to this rule is this vibrant set of paintings, which illustrates the ''Bhima Swarga,'' the Balinese folk tale that describes a hero's journey into the afterlife. Set in the ceiling of the royal pavilion in Klungkung, a former royal capital, these fixed, painted surfaces became a monument to the legal system established after Klungkung fell to the Dutch in 1908. The panels depict Bhima, that most approachable high-born protagonist in the ''Mahabharata,'' witnessing punishments that characterize the Hindu hell: ordeals by fire, boiling, anal and genital mutilations and horrific battles. Along with the few remaining relics of Klungkung's once expansive palace area, the work has been preserved, occasionally restored and added to Bali's principal tourist sites. Idanna Pucci, a widely traveled freelance writer who has lived in Indonesia, organized this stately volume around splendid photographs, most of which were taken by Hans Hoefer, a publisher and photographer who lives in Singapore, before recent applications of acrylic paints to the panels. The book isolates individual scenes in extraordinarily subtle colors set off against surrounding panels left in black and white.",1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Now, I am carefully instructed all over the box to cut open the plastic bags specifically with scissors (capitalized and often underlined). So what was wrong with slashing them with a knife, or ripping them apart with my own little fingers, I asked myself. Then, what I perceive as the horrible truth, dawned on me. I bet some careless housewife (I hate the term ''homemaker'') slashed her hand with a knife instead of the plastic bag, or shredded the plastic bag with her fingers so some pieces of it fell into the mix. Naturally, she promptly sued the manufacturer for making faulty plastic bags. Why else would the manufacturer care how we opened the bag?

In his introduction to this exhaustive listing of the hyperactive characters who have been a colorful part of the American scene for half a century, Jeff Rovin indicates that the superhero is not exactly a new boy on the block. Perhaps the first recorded superhero is in the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh, circa 2000 B.C. Gilgamesh was the King of Erech, part god, part human. Other mythological old boys Mr. Rovin mentions are Neph, a ram-headed Egyptian; Husheng, a Persian monster-slayer, and Rama, an Indian archer and warrior. ''In the earliest days, we called them 'gods,' '' writes Mr. Rovin, a comic-book editor and television consultant. The true superhero, Mr. Rovin says, must have at least one superpower, must be ''neither vindictive nor selfish'' and ''must function like the secretary-general of the United Nations, working for the good of everyone.'' Merlin, Ulysses and John Henry fail to make the grade. Moses doesn't qualify because ''he stretched forth his hand over the sea [and] there remained not so much as one'' Egyptian, while ''the Lone Ranger never killed a soul'' and ''is a saint.''",1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Nor did David Lean's thoughts of filming the book ever materialize. In the early 1970's, Nicolas Roeg thought of directing a film with Julie Christie as the Danish-born author and Ryan O'Neal as the Swedish Baron whom she married. But if the book, which Dinesen's biographer Judith Thurman has called ''a landscape from the air,'' has a keen sense of character and place that have made it alluring from the film maker's standpoint, it also has an uneventfulness that has kept it well out of reach.

Consider the front view - or the face - of the 1955 Cadillac Fleetwood. The hood comes forward like the bulging forehead of a beluga whale. Slow, deep curves connect this forehead to fenders containing two hooded, saturnine eyes. A silver tusk juts from either side of the grinning, heavily chromed grill. Zoomorphic indeed. And this orgy of curved surfaces renders the aerodynamically sound boxes we drive today bland and soulless. In ''Cadillac,'' the Brooklyn-born photographer, Stephen Salmieri, displays the results of a 12-year search that took him and his wife, Sydnie Michele Salmieri, coast to coast through junkyards, ghettoes, deserts, auto shows, amusement parks and funeral homes in a pilgrimage for these living rooms on wheels. If your soul soars when you gaze on the winged, pachyderm sleekness of a '59 Cadillac -those vast fins, each attended by two bullet-shaped taillights - these 80 or so portraits, along with Owen Edwards's quirky, on-the-mark essay, may constitute nirvana for you. Some purists may balk at the colors Mrs. Salmieri used in hand-painting the black-and-white photographs - some of them never were and probably never will be available in Cadillacs - but the effect she achieves is mildly and pleasantly surrealistic. Mr. Edwards's essay is emphatically not just dressing. He peels back the layers of the American psyche and analyzes our love of the horseless carriage. He invokes the ghost of Harley Earl - the General Motors designer responsible for fins and grinning grills - and gets Keats, poltergeists and the Holy Grail into the discussion in meaningful ways.",1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Ponnelle, who not only directed but designed sets and costumes for the Met's first new staging of Mozart's opera in a decade, made several miscalculations, the most glaring being his overbearing and carefully decayed scenery, by now a Ponnelle trademark, if not cliche, in the three Mozart works he has produced for this company. The scale of the production, with its use of the full cavernous depths of the Metropolitan stage for key scenes, is such that the opera's human, conversational aspects are diminished if not lost. The singing itself is often swallowed up, not so damagingly as to volume as in expressive nuance. There is, I submit, something beetle-browed and obtuse about the notion that the Countess should begin her wistful ''Porgi amor'' while seated on a bed so far from the audience that she might as well be in another opera for all the connection she makes with her listeners.",1985-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Mention the need for ''high visibility'' at your peril; the Hagen idea of theater is at odds with convention.

When lukewarm or downright miffed, he restricts himself to a bare-bones recapitulation of the plot up to that point.

''During his many expeditions,'' the note from Simon & Schuster reads, Mr. Davis ''was initiated into secret rites and ceremonies traditionally off-limits to whites; was caught in gunfire between soldiers and guerrillas; was mistaken for a Dutch gunrunner; he ate a lunch of fresh termites with warriors in loincloths; got lost among the Jivaro, the famed headhunters; flew an aging wreck of a DC-3 over the Andes when the pilot was hung over.

(Ages 3 to 7) THE new edition of ''Mother Goose'' by Tomie dePaola is a mutedly colorful, well-designed and rich sampling of 200-plus rhymes and songs of childhood. Its selections, leaning heavily toward those emphasizing domestic animals - cows, pigs, ducks, hens, geese, cats and dogs - make this a Mother Goose decidedly aimed at the younger range of listeners. (It also results in an unavoidable sameness to some of the pictures, particularly in the early part.) The rhymes are told complete in most instances, with the texts taken from Iona and Peter Opie, the folklore specialists in Britain. The book includes such nontraditional rhymes as ''Three little ghostesses, / Sitting on postesses'' and '' 'I went up one pair of stairs.' 'Just like me.' '' (This ends with, '' 'And there I saw a monkey.' 'Just like me.' '') Here, as elsewhere in a markedly successful 20-year career in children's picture books, Mr. dePaola provides ingratiating, cheerful and intelligent illustrations, albeit perhaps too bland. His ''Mother Goose'' cuts a commendably wide ethnic swath with black, Hispanic, Oriental and gypsy characters taking full part in the verse happenings.

As the game played itself out in a flurry of home runs and fielding errors, a commentator introduced one of those statistics that serve not so much to enlighten as to divert - a televised version of the newspaper sidebar. The script was altogether routine: citation of the baseball statistic from 1906 (''most home runs in an All-Star Game''); transition to author and best seller (''the same year a man named Upton Sinclair published a book called 'The Jungle' ''); tie-in about novelist and hitter having had a good year. Pause. Next pitch. Sinclair's cameo appearance was pretty inconsequential - not unlike other instances since the Bicentennial in which little-known episodes in American history are rendered as a series of ''spots'' on commercial television. But the episode roughly coincided with the purchase of the New York Mets in 1980 by an investment group headed by Doubleday & Company, the parent company of the house that originally published ''The Jungle.'' That acquisition, of course, was only part of a larger pattern of the last 20 years best described in Thomas Whiteside's ''Blockbuster Complex: Conglomerates, Show Business, and Book Publishing'' (1981) - the diversification of independent houses like Doubleday into entertainment industries; the transfer of once-privately owned publishing houses to multinational conglom-erates (I.T.T., Gult & Western, M.C.A.); the new emphasis on orchestrating books and Hollywood ''concepts'' through million-dollar auctions and promotional tours.",1985-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"MY DISCOVERY OF AMERICA. By Farley Mowat. (Atlantic Monthly, $12.95.) When the Canadian writer Farley Mowat was barred from entering the United States last April, he wondered, naturally enough, why. Mr. Mowat's frequently hilarious book chronicles his quest to get a sensible answer from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The author of ''Never Cry Wolf'' learned he and thousands of others are blacklisted under the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, a law intended to keep Communists and anarchists out of the country. Given no further explanation from immigration officials, Mr. Mowat examined his conscience. Was the problem his book ''The Siberians''? On reflection he admitted he had ''treated the Soviets as human beings essentially like us.'' Or was it ''Sea of Slaughter,'' which condemned the butchery of wildlife along the United States and Canadian coasts? Neither, an anonymous immigration official finally explained. Mr. Mowat, he said, was a serious espionage risk and a threat to our armed forces. According to a 1968 newspaper clipping in a Government file, the author - no stranger to bluster - had said he took potshots with a .22 at United States bombers flying over Newfoundland. The way Mr. Mowat tells it now, the planes were visible only with binoculars - decidedly out of range for a rifle commonly used to hunt squirrels. Since he believed the aircraft carried hydrogen bombs, Mr. Mowat says he had even less reason to shoot. After he was refused entry and the Government was lambasted in newspapers across the nation, officials rigged an escape hatch for themselves: they would ''parole'' Mr. Mowat.",1985-12-22T05:00:00+0000

As a rule, films about cultural transference are also films about cultural collision. Someone or something loses. ''Silk Screen,'' at least in its opening presentation -''Jazz Is My Native Language,'' on Channel 13 at 11 o'clock tonight - is more interesting than that. If nothing else, the first program suggests that the series is only an excuse to join three films about Asians or Asian-Americans that are also made by Asians or Asian-Americans, and that in a category like this there is considerable room for maneuver. ''Jazz Is My Native Language'' is not about the impact of one culture on another; it is about a woman, her life and her music, and it is really pretty good.",1985-12-22T05:00:00+0000

Last year Alan Riding wrote in The Book Review that ''from a literary point of view, this book is perhaps not among his most memorable - he has conceded he found it difficult to write. But from a human point of view, it is compellingly compassionate.'' BLUE JUNIATA: A LIFE. Collected and New Poems, by Malcolm Cowley. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $7.95.) In 1929 Malcolm Cowley first published this volume of poems; in 1968 he reissued it, with what our reviewer, Kenneth Burke, called ''several superb additions.'' Mr. Burke added: ''To go through the whole sequence of these poems is to follow, in Cowley the poet, the embodiment of the trends that are treated by Cowley in his role as historian of the literary situations characteristic of our times. . . . All told, the collection is expert, and poignantly relevant.'' HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS: Or the Remembered Past, by John Lukacs. (Schocken, $13.95.) The 300-to-400-year evolution of historical consciousness is at least as important as the scientific revolution in the view of John Lukacs.

I am not being ironic when I relate his nationality to his presumed scholarship, since America has the time and the money to spend on Shakespeare studies, while we in Britain have good-humoredly relinquished them to American brains and American computers. If Gary Taylor asserts that the poem in question - which has turned up in the Bodleian Library at Oxford in a volume dated 1630 - is by Shakespeare, then we are inclined to take seriously his American instinct, poetic ear and background of Shakespearean know-how.

Illustrated. 270 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $22.50. ONE of the most remarkable features of E. P. Sanders' latest contribution to the study of Christian origins is that it lacks a subtitle. In effect, the author claims to be presenting a total picture of an extremely complex topic. The wonder is that to a large degree he has succeeded. I would be surprised if ''Jesus and Judaism'' does not turn out to be the most significant book of the decade in its field. For Mr. Sanders, who is the Dean Ireland's Professor of Exegesis of Holy Scripture in the University of Oxford, the task confronting historians of earliest Christianity is easily defined - how to characterize Jesus' intentions and His relationship to His Jewish contemporaries. That Jesus was executed by the Romans no one doubts. But to what extent, if any, did His death result from some opposition by Him to the Judaism of His day?",1985-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Music/Noted in Brief;   Daniel Lentz Ensemble At Carnegie Hall,"Little bits of music and words pile up in complicated ways in the compositions of Daniel Lentz, who brought his ensemble to Carnegie Recital Hall on Wednesday. Mr. Lentz controlled a multitrack tape recorder, on which he layered and replayed the sounds made by the musicians onstage. This method was used for three very diverse pieces - the 45-minute ''Coyote Dances,'' the 20-minute ''Bacchus'' and the seven-minute ''On the Leopard Altar.'' ''Bacchus'' was a theatrical showpiece. Jessica Lowe, David Kuehn, Brad Ellis and Mariliz Romano sat, formally dressed, inside an acoustically isolated capsule at a table laden with glasses and wine bottles. They sang fragments of sentences about the pleasures of wine while tapping, rubbing or blowing on the glasses and bottles, which were retuned by drinking the wine in them. Through Mr. Lentz's multitracking, the sounds and text fragments built up until the full quotations were heard. It was wry, delicate music. One sentence was delivered entirely in whispers, against lightly tapped glasses; the second used the quiet hooting of blown bottles against rippling, gamelan-flavored arpeggios and sustained voices; the third used percolating rhythms and percussively articulated consonants. ''On the Leopard Altar'' set a gory text sweetly. Six short, consonant ''songs'' accompanied by simple keyboard chords fit together in a rippling chorale, with a playback as each piece was added; Miss Lowe lighted a candle before she began each song. ''Coyote Dances,'' a world premiere, was less theatrical. Three busy synthesizer players played short riffs that built up into twinkling and then, fairly quickly, propulsive chords.",1985-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"MUSIC: SEILERS, PIANISTS","THE duo pianists Ernst and Kazuko Seiler drew a large audience at Carnegie Recital Hall on Monday night for a complete traversal of Bach's monumental valedictory work, ''The Art of the Fugue,'' in Bruno Seidlhofer's four-hand arrangement. (Bach did not specify instrumentation, and the different fugues have different numbers of contrapuntal voices.) All arrangements are interpretations, and Seidlhofer's interpretation, with which the Seilers seemed in concord, is that ''The Art of the Fugue'' is a work whose grandeur should be expressed through powerful, resonant sonorities. Two-voiced sections, thus, were not played by one pianist or another but by both, with each line doubled in octaves or even 15ths. At one point, unless my ears misled me (I could not see their hands) the theme thundered forth in six octaves - in other words, both hands of the secondo player and the left hand of the primo player in one grand unison. Many pieces ended with a series of enormous fortissimo chords, and with big rallentandos (in these Mrs. Seiler sometimes tended to follow a slight distance behind her husband).",1985-12-26T05:00:00+0000

And if that weren't enough, the city often seems to add to all the frustrations with its own intractable conditions: dangerous subways, random violence, filthy streets, roving bands of nut cases, rip-off artists and con men. What Thomas Glynn has done in his first novel, ''The Building,'' is take all the grotesqueries of life in New York and reflect them through a fun-house mirror that distorts and magnifies all that is ugly and perverse. The result is a particularly nasty novel that strives to be taken as a hallucinatory epic about modern civilization - a novel that reads like a tabloid newspaper written by an assiduous student of Swift, Kafka and Marquez.",1985-12-28T05:00:00+0000

Zydeco (the name is probably derived from ''haricots,'' or snap beans) is a hybrid of blues, country, rhythm-and-blues, rock and, of course, Cajun waltzes and two-steps; it rolls as much as it rocks, and its tootling beat will be familiar to anyone who's heard the Talking Heads' ''Road to Nowhere'' or Dire Straits' ''The Walk of Life.''",1985-12-29T05:00:00+0000

There is one brief mention of mussels: ''Mussels, eaten in England and other parts of Europe, are similar to oysters, though of inferior quality.'' I also own a 1930 edition of that masterpiece, edited, of course, by Fannie Merritt Farmer, and mussels are omitted altogether. I own a facsimile of the first edition of Mrs. Beeton's remarkable English work, ''The Book of Household Management,'' with hundreds of recipes, not one of which mentions mussels. The good news is that time has altered these concepts, and mussels are found in abundance in American waters. Now, they are prized as one of the ultimate seafoods, both in this country and in England, and they are in such demand they are now imported from Irish and New Zealand waters.",1985-12-29T05:00:00+0000

I was thus able to follow the dictates of my own spirit, and to an amazing degree. This was the situation into which ''A Study of History'' by Arnold J. Toynbee intruded. I well remember first catching sight of those three volumes, bound in bright green, nestling at eye level in one of the bays of the White Library. It was a completely random encounter: the books still smelled of fresh print, and had never been used before. Nor did I have the slightest idea of the experience that lay before me when I took them down from the shelves. What could be more noncommittal than ''A Study of History,'' with an unknown name on the spine? But I was soon engrossed. An easy chair adorned the central bay of the White Library, some 15 feet from the place in the shelves where I stumbled on the ''Study,'' and there I planted myself for the next two or three days to read Toynbee's three volumes through in one gulp. That was all that was then available. Volumes Four to Six had been published in England in September 1939, but they had not yet reached the shelves of Cornell's library.",1985-12-29T05:00:00+0000

The situation comedy, reinvigorated by the success of ''The Cosby Show'' on NBC, squelched premature reports of its demise with at least two new lively entries: NBC's ''Golden Girls'' and CBS's ''Mary.'' At the same time, demonstrating that the private-detective genre could still work up a touch of class, ABC came forth with ''Moonlighting.'' Over on public television, budget juggling continued to place a heavy accent on imported programs, primarily British, but ''American Playhouse,'' the single domestic jewel in PBS's drama crown, managed to put together an impressive package of quality presentations, including the best American television film of the year: ''Go Tell It on the Mountain.''

us,  REPRESENTATIVE SCHROEDER: AN IDEA THAT IS LONG OVERDUE,"WITH rrrecord numbers of women in the work force, more and more employees are asking employers to clarify their policies on maternity leave. Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat, has introduced a bill that would require employers to provide at least four months of leave for a father or mother who chooses to stay home with a newborn infant, a newly adopted child or one who is seriously ill. Under existing law, a disability related to pregnancy must be treated like other short-term disabilities that might affect a person's ability to work. But there is great variation in the amount and terms of disability leave employers provide. Representative Schroeder and James A.

The three-hour program, produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation and given its American premiere Thursday evening at 8 on Arts and Entertainment, presents a concert given last February in honor of the 300th birthday of George Frideric Handel, which was itself a re-creation of a concert presented upon the 100th anniversary of the composer's birth. But the centenary celebrants seem to have got the date wrong: a monument to Handel in Westminster Abbey - where both concerts took place, separated by some 200 years - notes his birthday as Feb. 23, 1684, and the 100th-birthday concert was dutifully held on that day in 1784.

Under existing law, a disability related to pregnancy must be treated like other short-term disabilities that might affect a person's ability to work.

After all, this was her baby, who had grown inside of her as she nurtured him month after month. The father was also transfixed with joy. It was his baby, too, his son. As for me, I held the baby carefully in my arms. I wanted to feel my kinship with him, but somehow I couldn't experience the surge of joy that is supposed to engulf grandfathers; yet I will acknowledge that my wife dissolved when she first beheld her grandson. No, there was curiosity, but the infant was hardly a person one could love. Little by little, I must report, the blob of humanity began to develop more definite features and to focus his attention. He even learned to smile, and I smiled back and spoke to him, although I was sure he couldn't understand a word I said.
