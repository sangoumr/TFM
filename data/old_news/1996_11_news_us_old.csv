After considering all the big-name talent that money can attract, Ellison settled on Olle Lundberg, a relatively unknown, 42-year-old architect who likes to work with his hands -- anathema to any modernist reared on mass production -- fabricating much of the hardware for his projects in his office.",1996-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Love Hurts,"Ethan Hawke the actor is the 25-year-old star of such movies as ''Dead Poets Society,'' ''Reality Bites'' and ''Before Sunrise.'' Ethan Hawke the novelist is part of the cross-pollination trend in the art and entertainment world, but far less embarrassing than Julian Schnabel putting out a rock-and-roll CD. In THE HOTTEST STATE (Little, Brown, $19.95), Mr. Hawke does a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion, but if he didn't want us to think his book was autobiographical, why did he make the main character an actor? In ''The Hottest State,'' William Harding falls hard for Sarah Wingfield, a preschool teacher from Seattle who sings at the Bitter End, wears dresses because she thinks her thighs are fat and reads only black women authors. William is from Texas by way of New Jersey, and lives in the East Village. Sarah breaks his heart and William breaks lots of other things -- a chair, a refrigerator, his kitchen cabinets, two telephones and a pair of contact lenses. It's difficult to have much sympathy for William when he's lashing out at the people and objects around him, but in the end we can't help it. (After all, he finds plump girls sexy.) Young love. Doesn't last. ''The Hottest State'' is ultimately that: a sweet love story. It doesn't belabor the Zeitgeist like ''Bright Lights, Big City''; instead, it easily evokes the restlessness of being 21 in the mid-1990's south of 14th Street. Jen Nessel",1996-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Artful Dodger,"Next year will mark a half-century since Jackie Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball. In anticipation, his widow, Rachel Robinson, and his daughter, Sharon, have each written an ''intimate'' account. And, perhaps surprisingly in an era of tell-all confessionals where dirt flies as copiously as that kicked on umpires by Robinson's former manager Leo Durocher, both take the high road. STEALING HOME: An Intimate Family Portrait by the Daughter of Jackie Robinson (HarperCollins, $24) is a paean to the former baseball great's achievements on the field, in public life and at home. And why not? Sharon Robinson's relationship with her father was apparently idyllic. Born in 1950, she was not present for his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, and scarcely remembers the abuse from fans and opponents that he silently endured or the hate mail with which he was bombarded. Instead, she focuses on the years after his retirement following the 1956 season. The only friction she reports concerns her difficulty growing up in an all-white Connecticut suburb and the dissension between her father and her oldest brother, Jackie Jr., who was arrested for weapon and drug possession and later died at the age of 24 in an automobile accident. Her own abusive first marriage is recounted, but only a few pages are devoted to her father's political rifts with black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Bunche and Malcolm X, or his controversial support of Richard Nixon in the 1960 Presidential election. Rachel Robinson is even less revealing in JACKIE ROBINSON: An Intimate Portrait (Abrams, $29.95). Her book, written with the journalist Lee Daniels, is basically a celebratory picture album. The photographs, many drawn from the Jackie Robinson Foundation archives, portray Robinson's rise from teen-age stardom in the Pasadena, Calif., school system to his legendary baseball career and subsequent work as a civil rights activist. Many are exceptional. In addition, the foreword by Roger Wilkins puts Jackie Robinson's achievements in balanced perspective. Sharon Robinson hyperbolically claims that breaking the baseball color line was ''one of the most historic moments in the 20th century'' and that ''nothing in the world was ever quite the same again''; Mr. Wilkins's reasoned assessment describes Robinson's enormous contribution to black American life. The highlight of this book is its penultimate photograph. That picture of Robinson with hand pressed to his brow, weary and graying but with eyes still alert, captures better than any words could express the pride, determination, independence and complexity of a man who for a time carried the weight of his race on his shoulders.

These are words from the editorial pages of several newspapers describing the campaign between Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Torricelli to claim the seat of Bill Bradley, the three-term Democrat who is retiring after three Senate terms. Indeed, the race has been among the nastiest and costliest in the country, with the two hurling invective in an apparent game of can-you-top-this. The stakes are high: the race is seen as a toss-up, and pivotal in a Senate that is up for grabs. Mr. Zimmer has portrayed Mr. Torricelli as a liberal with questionable ethics; Mr. Torricelli has painted his opponent as an extremist supporting most of Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda. The truth, not surprisingly, lies somewhere in the middle. Mr. Zimmer, a pro-abortion-rights moderate who has recently distanced himself from Bob Dole, is a deficit hawk who was also instrumental in the passage of the Federal version of Megan's Law. Mr. Torricelli, meanwhile, has been a staunch supporter of gun control (while Mr. Zimmer has revised his position) and the environment, and is well-versed in foreign affairs.",1996-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Still Overwhelming,"It is 41 years since Sir John Pope-Hennessy, in the first of what would become a three-volume study, set out to persuade scholars to pay as much attention to Italian sculpture as they did to painting. That volume covered the Gothic period. Three years later, in 1958, came the second, on the 15th-century Renaissance, and in 1963 the third, on sculptors from Michelangelo to Bernini. He certainly succeeded: by now a second generation of scholars has followed his call and our understanding of this art changes almost daily. So this great book has had to change as well. As early as 1970 Pope-Hennessy began extensive revisions that continued through three editions. And when he died in October 1994, he had just completed work on the fourth edition of what he still modestly called AN INTRODUCTION TO ITALIAN SCULPTURE (Phaidon, three volumes, slip-cased, $345). The publisher has redesigned it, supplying hundreds of new spectacular black-and-white photographs and integrating them more closely with the text than they ever have been. Not that any illustration could be as eloquent as Pope-Hennessy. He is so restrained and so precise that the power of his emotions catches a reader by surprise. No book on art is more intelligent, more learned and unpretentious, or more infused with passion; it is a tremendously exciting education in art, history, society, the advancement of thought and craft -- in a word, in civilization. And few art books are as engagingly personal. Reading it is like listening to a good friend, who happens to be the most sensitive student of Italian art in this century, share his deepest responses to these glorious works and their creators. At times this can be overwhelming. It is hard to imagine an attentive reader who could get through the section on Donatello, for instance, without having to walk away from it now and then to regain composure. D. J. R.

A room here is itself a calling card, a credential that identifies the lodger as a Somebody, or at least as somebody willing to go along with the way the Japanese expect visiting Somebodies to behave. There may be better hotels in Tokyo. Fancier, more expensive, and more modern hotels are numerous throughout the city. Let them all try harder. There is only one Okura.",1996-11-10T05:00:00+0000

Now clean and running a New York City after-school program, Manigault is the subject of the HBO movie ''Rebound,'' to be shown Nov. 23. ''That stuff they're doing now is just a repeat of the 60's and 70's,'' says the Goat, a tall, shaven-headed 52-year-old who, like many playground greats, likes to convey a healthy blaseness about the N.B.A. ''I know at least 10 guys out of every block that are at least as good as any guy in the N.B.A.'' Um, 10? ''Well, maybe not 10.'' As for today's top players, the Goat agrees with anyone paying attention that Michael Jordan remains the best. Who's next?

My own unscientific survey leads me to the conclusion that perhaps 2 out of 10 people enjoyed their high-school years and that most spent the time feeling out of place and miserable. This was certainly my case; I was short, flat-chested, smart and raised by parents who felt it was more important that I be interesting rather than popular. I thus had no social life at all.

us,The Road to La Mancha,"''I'm just a storyteller,'' apologizes Miguel de Cervantes, the narrator of Stephen Marlowe's novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF MIGUEL DE CERVANTES (Arcade, $25.95). But that seems to be more than enough. From the facts of the author's life, judiciously mixed with variants on the adventures of his knight from La Mancha, Mr. Marlowe has fashioned an exuberant, fantastical portrait of Europe and North Africa in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, when the cultures and philosophies of Islam, Judaism and Christianity both mingled and clashed. Mr. Marlowe lets Cervantes speak in a voice of high irony that deftly connects the novel's numerous strands. Here illusion and reality meld: for example, the people Cervantes loves never grow old, even though others can see their wrinkled faces; granted knowledge of the future, he comments with wild comic effect on latter-day critics' assessments of his work. Although there are times when the sheer extravagance of the narration becomes wearing, when events begin to feel redundant, Mr. Marlowe's facility of language and image remains impressive. His novel is a remarkable examination of a tumultuous era in history, of the redemptive force of fiction and of one man's quest for achievement, for a homeland, for love -- and for a way to give of himself to others.

us,Angels With Attitude,"It seems that there actually are angels in America -- not only on the Broadway stage, but in inner-city Detroit. And these aren't the wistful greeting-card cherub variety or the swirly seraphim found peeking from the inspirational-book racks. The winged humans in David Sosnowski's wry, dry first novel are angels with attitude. RAPTURE (Villard, $23) starts off with Zander Wiles, a small-time Motor City drug dealer who one day feels a strange itching and weeks later finds himself with a pair of nine-foot black wings growing out of his back and an increased magnetic field emanating from his chest cavity. Zander eventually heads for New York, gets himself an agent and becomes the first angel to go public. However, the angel epidemic is on the rise, as is public awareness. A college student named Cassie O'Connor cross-references her symptoms at the campus library to find that she might have ''the flu, food poisoning, AIDS or that new, weird one -- Angelism.'' The novel's allegorical structure allows Mr. Sosnowski to skewer the whole spectrum of modern culture as he chronicles a newly self-aware minority going through all the trials of joining a suspicious society. Congress encumbers them with legislation and religious pundits weakly rationalize their existence, but the Angels go on to gain that true pinnacle of acceptance -- their own mainstream marketing niche. The Feathered Nation soon has its own bars, movie theaters (featuring ''perch-style seating''), support groups, bumper stickers, pop slang and militant factions. As the book's plot kicks in, the alert reader will figure out that Zander's flight path is destined to cross with Cassie's, and the witty, arch angel banter they engage in as their romance unfolds is one of the book's greatest delights.

Mr. Dowling serves up tiny snippets of the arcane about the covers, like the fact that the gold lame suit Elvis wore on the cover of 1959's ''50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong'' was designed by Liberace's couturier, Nudie, and was said to have cost $10,000. But what's really interesting is the way RCA subtly manipulated the images of Elvis to suit the tastes of a particular country. So, for example, on his second album, 1956's ''Elvis,'' the Mexican release features the King with jet-black hair and eyebrows, looking every inch the mariachi -- while the English release features a foppish Elvis in a velvet poet's shirt that would have looked splendid on Byron. One needs an obsessive interest in Presley, or record marketing, or both, to enjoy this book. Still, one can't help but admire Mr. Dowling's passion. And in a nicety not lost on Elvis fans, the author dedicates the book to his own mother. Surely the King would approve. Judith Newman",1996-11-17T05:00:00+0000

Other productions, plunged in darkness, completely miss the giddy brightness of the play, with its fairies who mischievously mix in the lives of mortals, its hapless rustics who aspire to be tragedians and its wondrous (and prescient) explorations of the unconscious. The right balance has eluded many fine directors.",1996-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Instead, travelers and informants come to him, and he attempts to give shape to their visions. Thus we hear about the Vatican emissary to the Mongols and about the Devil worshipers of Mosul (who believe that Jesus will reign eventually, but only after the Devil is through). We also learn of ''a mysterious race of men who hop about on one huge foot the size of an umbrella, whereupon they use this same foot to shade themselves during the full heat of midday,'' and of other people who determine their fate by ''the call of seven sacred birds.'' Fra Mauro admires the courage of the explorers, fretting sometimes that he isn't really living his life. But, after a time, he comes to believe that the world he hopes to capture resides in the human consciousness and can only be sought after there. Mr. Cowan's book is beautifully written, if slightly static. (The reader sometimes wishes Fra Mauro would simply get off his duff.) More a series of meditations than a narrative, it will have special appeal to lovers of arcane knowledge, a group to which the author obviously belongs. David Guy",1996-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Finally, her coiffure must also embody the spirit of the age.

He nominated as Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea, the young Mayor of Bucharest who swept ex-Communist bureaucrats out of city hall. Mr. Constantinescu cautioned Romanians to be patient, though.

They were acerbic critiques of contemporary society, politics and manners that subverted the conventions of mainstream magazines. Many were dramatic photographs or photomontages, some were caricatures and one was just type ('' 'Oh my God -- we hit a little girl': The true story of M Company From Fort Dix to Vietnam''). They were not fettered by extraneous text, thus creating an impact like that of a poster. Of the 70 covers reproduced in COVERING THE '60s: George Lois, the Esquire Era (Monacelli, paper, $35), with anecdotal annotations by Mr. Lois, the most memorable are icons of the age, with trenchant cover lines: ''The Confessions of Lt. Calley,'' featuring a smiling portrait of the court-martialed leader of the My Lai massacre, surrounded by young Asian children; ''The final decline and total collapse of the American avant-garde,'' showing Andy Warhol drowning in a can of Campbell's tomato soup; ''The Passion of Muhammad Ali,'' showing the boxer like St. Sebastian, with arrows piercing his body; and ''Nixon's last chance. (This time he'd better look right!)'' with a profile of the 1968 Presidential candidate having his face made up. There are also lesser known covers, including portraits: Joseph McCarthy's henchman, Roy Cohn, with a halo over his head to illustrate what Mr. Lois calls a ''self-serving piece . . . in which he rationalized his skulduggery''; Norman Mailer in a King Kong suit, holding Germaine Greer -- ''The literary male chauvinist monster goes ape for the female liberationist doll,'' Mr. Lois writes; Jack Nicholson in the nude, illustrating a story on the high jinks of Hollywood (the only Lois cover to be killed on press). Here are the histories of a magazine in its golden age, a critical period of American social and political turmoil and the legacy of a remarkable graphic designer and commentator.Steven Heller",1996-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Throughout Fisher's long career as America's finest food writer, she never lost sight of that fact. She knew, of course, that eating could be refined beyond its animal necessity. It might bring pleasure in such subtle and complex ways that the mere alleviation of hunger ranked as almost an art. Fisher thought well enough of both food and writing to perfect a hybrid genre, starting with ''Consider the Oyster'' (1941) and ''How to Cook a Wolf'' (1942), that gently folded recipes into stories. But she never attributed to food a dignity or power that it cannot possess. Her highest praise for any dish, from bread and cheese to truffles, was to declare it ''good.''",1996-11-24T05:00:00+0000

A plane crashes, and the media go crazy, seeming to forget how vastly safer it is to fly than to drive to the corner for milk. A child dies from a fast-expanding air bag, and people forget the positive. ''What's getting lost,'' one safety advocate said, is that air bags ''have already shown their incredible payoff'' -- an estimated 1,600 lives saved, compared with 51 deaths traced to them. The goal now: save the 1,600 and the 51, too. The Transportation Department weighed in last week, moving to allow drivers to have air bags disconnected and let car makers come up with bags that inflate more slowly. Those both have their own risks, though, so other ideas are emerging, like ''two-speed'' air bags and even ''smart seats'' that sense the size of the passenger. Smart drivers might help, too.

When she was 8, her mother took her to a performance of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' and Anna experienced an epiphany -- a baptism by ballet. This and only this was what she wanted to do with her life, and two years later she was admitted to the Imperial School of Ballet.

Their presence is sometimes decorative, sometimes uplifting, occasionally infuriating. The criteria for appointment to this ad hoc hall of fame that takes up so much space in our thoughts and in our culture may at first glance appear to be utterly random.
