The Diary of a First-Year Teacher","MARCH 23, PUBLIC SCHOOL 29, BROOKLYN, N.Y., SIXTH GRADE: We had assembly today. It was a musical version of the early life of Helen Keller, and there was a simultaneous sign-language translation on the side. Alonzo, a charming but volatile boy, watched the sign language intently and moved his hands in an attempt to mimic and learn. I watched in silent admiration of his desire to know something new. In a few minutes, however, his concentration turned to frustration and he began mumbling and cursing to himself and thrashing to and fro in his seat. I leaned forward to whisper to him and ask what was wrong. He responded angrily, ""I don't know how to do this!"" I explained that nobody could learn sign language that fast and that I'd help him get started when we returned to the classroom. I wondered how many children are labeled behavior problems when it is really just a frustration with their capacities failing to keep up with their ambitions.MARCH 31: Had to raise my voice to regain attention during math. Yet even as I want my students to respond to me, I don't want them to think I am criticizing anything but their current behavior. It disturbs me that Evita is so easily cowed. She occasionally talks incessantly in class, and when I admonish her, she assumes an extremely submissive role. She doesn't apologize; in fact, she says nothing and conveys no message with her face, but instead, with downcast eyes and immobile features, slowly does what I ask. Except for her actions there is no clue that she either hears me or is listening. It disturbs me to see a child so submissive.",1993-08-01T05:00:00+0000

The final novel in the Danish writer Henrik Stangerup's trilogy of European historical fiction, ""Brother Jacob"" may be his best and most profound. Though studded with bloody episodes of the primitive, as befits its 16th-century setting, the drama, as energetically translated by Anne Born, turns on the commitments and renunciations of men and women for whom philosophy equals destiny. The title character, a member of the Danish royal family, joins the Franciscans just as Renaissance turns to Reformation. When he flees his suddenly Protestant homeland, Jacob's refugee existence becomes a search for utopia, a quest that steers him into quandaries of spirit evoked through nightmare physicality, often suggesting his tormented countryman Hamlet. At its most sublime, Mr. Stangerup's novel reconnects artistic integrity with its religious roots.",1993-08-01T05:00:00+0000

As He Painted, So He Wrote","For Karen Wilkin, ""the amazing continuity"" of Stuart Davis's work is the artist's recurring interest in particular compositions and subjects, which appears more in his drawings than in his paintings. Davis (1892-1964) incorporated this country's commercial icons into modern painting (anticipating Pop Art) in works like ""Lucky Strike"" (1921), and rewrote Cubism as a syncopated New World symphony, jazzing it up and making hot colors and hard-edged forms dance on a shallow stage. ""The amazing continuity"" is his own phrase: it appears as a slogan blazoned in black letters on the 1951 painting ""Visa."" Lewis Kachur points out that for Davis, the line separating writing, drawing and painting was quite thin. Unfortunately, so are the essays in THE DRAWINGS OF STUART DAVIS: The Amazing Continuity (American Federation of Arts/Abrams, $45), by Mr. Kachur and Ms. Wilkin, who are the curators of the touring exhibition, organized by the American Federation of Arts, for which this volume is the catalogue.

Pernfors, a top-10 player in 1986 who developed Achilles' tendon problems, got his first victory since he won in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1988. Pernfors, 30, the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the Canadian Open final at No. 95, earned $235,000 -- more than he had won since undergoing surgery on his injured foot in April 1990. Pernfors had upset Jim Courier, the No.2-seeded player, and Petr Korda, seeded sixth, en route to the final. Pernfors had dropped to a career low ranking of 1,001 in 1991 and had only rebounded to No. 237 by the end of last season.

He is already jittery about his defending Super Bowl champions although the first regular-season game is still a month away and quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt Smith are out of action. The Minnesota Vikings inflicted a 13-7 defeat on the Dallas Cowboys Sunday night in Irving, Tex., and Johnson acted as if someone had stolen his Super Bowl ring. ""It would be very easy to say we'll be fine when the season starts,"" said a red-faced Johnson, whose team leaves for London today for next Sunday's American Bowl game against the Detroit Lions. ""We need a sense of urgency on this team. It will be difficult to correct in next week's practices, but it will be corrected when we get back to Austin."" What Johnson wants to correct is five turnovers, three lost fumbles and two interceptions that kept the Cowboys from mounting any serious offense. However, the Cowboys will get only two days of hard work in London. Johnson didn't make any excuses for his tired team, which had three days of scrimmages against the Los Angeles Raiders and a scrimmage with the Houston Oilers just before they played the Vikings.

Huston birdied the first five holes and finished the first round with a 66. Payne Stewart and rookie Paul Goydos also were at six under in the final tuneup for next week's P.G.A.

Effective on Monday, Philip Morris will raise the price of its deep-discount brands like Basic and Famous Value by $3 per thousand cigarettes, or about 6 cents a pack, to $40.45 per thousand. Discount cigarettes, including Alpine and Cambridge, will also be set at this new level. Philip Morris scrapped the planned price increase earlier this week and said it would cut prices instead. But its rival, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, subsequently said it would raise the price of its own private labels.

The Posed and the Exposed","In the introduction to THE OTHER SIDE (Scalo, $39.95), her collection of photographs of transvestites and transsexuals from the United States, Europe and Asia, Nan Goldin writes that she never saw her subjects (who are also her friends) ""as men dressing as women, but as something entirely different -- a third gender that made more sense than either of the other two."" Although the photographer insists that she had ""no desire to unmask them with my camera,"" her candid images provide many glimpses backstage -- before the wigs are on, makeup applied, bras stuffed and attitudes adjusted. Whether shot in busy bars and streets or cluttered apartments and dressing rooms, Ms. Goldin's photographs blur the boundaries between public and private, the posed and the exposed. Often details in the background suggest that the photographer's subjects maintain a tense relationship with the larger world: the red AIDS ribbon pinned to Mistress Formica's long-line bra; the police officer who grins benignly at a transvestite while protectively clutching a nightstick; the handwritten signs at a bar advertising drinks to benefit a patron ""hospitalized due to police brutality."" As Ms. Goldin observes, ""It takes nerve to walk down the street when you fall between the cracks.""

Morceli, the world record-holder in the 1,500, ran the second-fastest 1,500 earlier this year in 3:29.20.

Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, Howard Dietz, Robert Benchley, Ilka Chase, Tallulah Bankhead's husband and Goodman Ace. In another letter in the same issue we found the poet Anthony Hecht upbraiding the novelist Alison Lurie for failing to notice a light-fingered borrowing by the novelist Peter Ackroyd from the poet Wordsworth about some sentimental mist glittering over some plashy earth. This is also missing from Bartlett's -- though the new edition has finally caught up with Evelyn Waugh's far more important plashitude: ""Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole.""",1993-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Weathering the Rally Event,"After the United States military fired missiles on Iraq on June 27, President Clinton's approval rating surged 11 points, to 50 percent, for a fortnight. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt watched his ratings climb after key moments of the Second World War, poll analysts have tracked these involuntary calls to patriotism and given them a name: rally events. A rally event always provides a boost -- though often only a momentary one -- even if the action is a disaster. Kennedy, for instance, sustained a five-point bump for a week following the Bay of Pigs incident. In fact, a President need not even be a willing participant, so long as he remains a sympathetic character. After Iran seized American hostages, Carter floated on a 30-week, 19-point high that ebbed, to his dismay, during the Democratic primaries; Reagan's approval rating leaped 7 points for 9 weeks following his attempted assasination. Of course, the public mind can be perverse: Johnson received his biggest bounce in March 1968 after announcing he would not run again.",1993-08-08T05:00:00+0000
us,Whose Vacation?,"To the Editor: Joyce Maynard's charming piece on travel to London with young children (""A Lark With Kids in London,"" July 11) reminds me of my own experiences abroad, especially in London and Paris, with toddlers and adolescents. When in Europe with small children, one delightful way to pass the time and see the sights is to use as a guide a favorite storybook, such as ""Babar Loses His Crown"" or ""Paddington Bear."" In the case of the former, with young Jonny Goldin clutching his own stuffed Babar, five Goldins traipsed from the bateau mouche to the Tour Eiffel to the Opera, everywhere looking for Babar's lost crown, following the book's text as itinerary. In London we retraced Paddington Bear's steps, again using the wonderful children's story as a guide and reading the text on bus rides between destinations. It is a marvelous way to engage children and their imaginations, while seeing the principal sights and interesting points in between. HARRISON J. GOLDIN New York, N.Y.",1993-08-08T05:00:00+0000
us,A Bright Balloon of a Building Soars at U.C.L.A.,"FOR MOST OF THIS CENTURY, architecture paralleled the increasing informality of modern life: fewer rooms, more flexible layouts, no elaborate moldings for nonexistent maids to dust. Then architecture reversed direction. Since the 1970's, many architects have contrived to put the starch back into buildings. The classical elegies of Michael Graves, the stiff-white-collar modernism of Richard Meier, the overwrought geometries of Peter Eisenman: though these esthetics have assumed vastly different forms, they share an evident antipathy toward the unstructured spaces promoted by modern architecture.

And Janet Reno, the first woman to head the Justice Department, has been the undeniable star of the proceedings. B10. NEW YORK CITY ANGRY SHOUTS FROM STATEN ISLAND The Staten Island secession movement, once dismissed as pointless grousing from a borough angered by its diminished role in city government, has grown in recent years into a powerful shout of resentment and distress that will go to a vote Nov. 2. Even die-hard supporters of secession do not think the proposal would make it through the gantlet in Albany. Yet successful or not, the movement has already sent a disturbing message to City Hall.

The band's music -- their hits include ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number,"" ""Peg"" and ""Hey 19"" -- fits like an Earth Shoe on classic-rock and contemporary-jazz radio-station formats. As a Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton played ""Reeling in the Years"" at campaign stops last year. Steely Dan CD's remain among MCA Records' most consistent sellers; their fussily produced music sounds even more pristine in that format.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
His Art Was Not a Cheerful Business","The English painter Walter Sickert (1860-1942) was the founder, in 1911, of a small band of gritty realists, the Camden Town Group. The group quickly gained notoriety with a British public used to what Sickert contemptuously called the ""lilies and languors"" of Pre-Raphaelite sentimentality by painting tired working-class faces in cramped North London flats, bawdy performers at seedy music halls and moody cityscapes. Sickert's grim subjects (as in ""The Camden Town Murder,"" where a fleshy woman lies sprawled on a dingy cot, her throat cut) and his disturbing palette of dirty yellow-ochers, dusty blues and sickly greens are thought to have paved the way for the severe, pessimistic art of contemporary British painters like Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon. While Sickert's influence on modern English art is well established, his own artistic evolution has been neglected. The publication of SICKERT: Paintings (Yale University, $60), edited by Wendy Baron, director of the British Government Art Collection, and by Richard Shone, associate editor of The Burlington Magazine, fills that gap and more. The excellently researched and handsomely produced volume details Sickert's nocturnal expeditions by the edge of the Thames with Whistler, the artist's friendship with Degas, and his great admiration for the French realists Millet and Courbet. What emerges is a portrait of a man fiercely determined to change the course of British art, motivated by the resigned belief that, as he wrote in 1908, ""for some reasons to me hidden and inscrutable, the genius of painting still hovers over Paris, and must be wooed on the banks of the Seine.""",1993-08-15T05:00:00+0000

Chicago Sun Times Challenge in Naperville, Ill. Schreyer shot a one-under-par 71 to finish with a 272 total on the White Eagle Club course. Her previous best showing this year was a 24th-place finish at the Dinah Shore Open, and she doubled her year's earnings with $71,250. For King, it was another disappointment, her 20th consecutive tournament without a victory. Schreyer and King were tied at 14 under when they got to the par-3 16th hole. Schreyer's tee shot on the 185-yard hole stopped in the left rough, and she chipped within 8 feet and made the putt. King's tee shot went over the green, and she three-putted from the fringe, her second putt missing from only 3 feet. The swing gave Schreyer the lead and the confidence she needed to go on to victory. King finished with a final-round 72, and Gail Graham was third with a 275 total after a closing 68. Kris Monaghan, Marta Figueras-Dotti and Dale Eggeling wound up tied for fourth.

Sanchez Vicario said she suffered a stretched muscle early in the match, an injury that all but eliminated her service game. Her Italian opponent broke serve three times in the first set and once in the second. But Sanchez Vicario broke Golarsa four times in the first set and three times in the second.

The exposure can be anywhere from a few inches to a foot deep. For some young women, the effect is achieved by tying a common T-shirt into a front knot (lower far right).

This is not a biography of Austen, Nigel Nicolson explains, but an attempt to help us see the world that she saw. Nonetheless, Mr. Nicolson, who is best known as the biographer of his parents, Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, presents an engaging introduction to Austen's life, as well as a portrait of the architectural styles and taste of the age, engagingly illustrated by Stephen Colover's photographs. Moreover, in guiding us through the houses, estates and landscapes that Austen knew in Kent, Hampshire, Bath and a variety of seaside resorts, Mr. Nicolson succeeds in his purpose of considering her novels ""as a product of her experience."" Austen (1775-1817) was the daughter of a parson of modest means who nonetheless had frequent social contacts with families on all levels of the social scale, including the nobility. Mr. Nicolson chronicles the Austen family's moves from one part of the country to another, along with Jane's frequent visits to nearby friends and relatives, and describes the ways in which her novels and letters reveal her preference for country over urban life and classical architectural styles over the ornate and romantic. Wisely, he refrains from claiming specific homes as models for any of the fictional residences in Austen's novels, pointing out that they were composites of her imagination's making. Mr. Nicolson, who lives in Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, displays a keen critical eye for architecture and design and a respectful appreciation for Austen's art.",1993-08-22T05:00:00+0000

But as law-enforcement authorities have focused their attention on stopping more boats from landing, many smugglers have turned to airplanes as their favored route of passage, and have developed new schemes to camouflage the small groups that arrive by plane each day. A1. EMPIRE TRIES AGAIN ON MANAGED CARE As Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield sets off on an ambitious plan to reduce costs by limiting the choice of doctors and medical care for millions of customers, company officials acknowledge that their previous foray into managed care has not been successful. But they say that they have corrected many of their problems and are working hard on the rest. B5. NEW YORK CITY RETIREES HEAD BACK TO NEW YORK Despite the fear of crime, grime and hassles in the city that never sleeps, experts say a growing number of retirees are bucking decades-old migration patterns by moving to New York for its quality of life. Older and sicker than when they left, they have returned to be closer to family and for the city's plentiful services. The retirement migration has contributed at least in part to an explosion in the city's elderly population, officials say. A1. SEARCHING FOR A KILLER AND A MOTIVE In the tense neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Brownsville, the police are searching for a man who has killed four people and critically wounded two more. Investigators say they are not able to determine either the motive or determine how the gunman chose his victims. All they have been able to do is establish, through ballistics tests, that the same 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol was used in the shootings, which began Aug. 12. In most cases, the victims were left with their valuables. The killer, the police said, simply walked up to his victims and began to shoot. B2. QUESTIONS FOR THE BUDGET DIRECTOR He still does not get it. Philip R. Michael was forced to resign as the New York City Budget Director after investigators concluded that he had shown favoritism towards a company trying to win a city contract. Mr. Michael maintains that he did nothing improper and makes no apologies for his efforts to balance the city budget. But the report on the Department of Investigation's five-month inquiry raises questions about his judgment and the appearance of impropriety. Metro Matters, B3.

The owner and other downtown merchants say that nothing has disrupted business as much as the city's $24 million redevelopment project. Last year downtown streets were impassable for more than six months. This year the city has torn them up again. B5.

Wilson, playing a complete half for the first time since the Saints acquired him this summer, completed 13 of 22 passes for 134 yards and a touchdown. He also threw one interception and led New Orleans to a 10-0 halftime lead.

The country that created the game of bowlers and wickets and then spread it throughout its empire snapped a five-series streak yesterday with a lopsided victory over Australia in London. England's last victory in a Test match was against Pakistan in July 1992, and its last victory over Australia was in December 1986. Australia won the first four matches in this summer's series and needed 391 runs on the final day to complete a sweep. But English bowlers Steve Watkin, Devon Malcolm and Angus Fraser shut down the visitors' bats, with Watkin taking four wickets and Malcolm and Fraser three apiece. Australia wound up 161 runs short.

us,Back When Antiques Were New,"Jane C. Nylander, the director of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, invites her readers to enjoy her copious knowledge of the interiors and domestic management of late-18th-century New England homes. The imaginatively illustrated OUR OWN SNUG FIRESIDE: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860 (Knopf, $30) is dedicated to the notion that the details of everyday life form the core of human experience. The author uses artifacts and literary and graphic recollections of 19th-century New Englanders to describe in rich detail a ceaseless round of household activities. She explicates the laborious processes by which New Englanders produced their food, clothing and light and kept themselves clean and warm. Ms. Nylander walks the reader through heating a New England home in winter, preparing an 18th-century dinner and washing and ironing the colonial laundry. Although Ms. Nylander warns of the 19th-century antiquarians' tendency to idealize and sentimentalize an undemocratic age, she does not screen her own firesides from these same weaknesses. Here and there a disturbing shadow flickers across the cheery, blazing hearth -- for example, the black mother who retrieves her daughter from service with a white family despite the mistress's protests. These and other scenes go unremarked upon, but the shadows remind us of other New England firesides, not so snug yet equally our own.",1993-08-29T05:00:00+0000

Right now, reggae permeates pop more than it has since the death of Bob Marley in 1981, and interest in both classic and progressive reggae runs high.

us,Shadow Play,"As August fades, the sidewalks are filled with long black shadows suggesting Giacometti sculptures. Or could it be that Morticia, the macabre Charles Addams character, is putting out her own line of dresses? The wearers, many of them with straight hair parted in the center and black platform shoes or Doc Marten boots, have produced a startling imagery that has gained in popularity as fashion leaders abandon summer clothes for the darker transitional colors that signal the post-Labor Day look. What's new with this year's all-black day look is the ground-skimming hem that represents a generation gap between older women who are holding out for short skirts because they feel long ones make them look older and younger women who are forging their own identities with the novelty of longer lengths. Two designers who have spearheaded this striking look are the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and the Belgian deconstructionist Martin Margiela. Whether it's with satiny one-piece black dresses or any combination of black sportswear, the effect is the same: an inky silhouette to the ground. What many wearers have created is a surface of multiple textures that gives the all-black look depth and character.",1993-08-29T05:00:00+0000

And it has a main big T-shaped room that could be a great Interview office, but you can't rent anything out. It goes up five floors and there's no heat, it's just like one shell, but it's so perfectly beautiful.

The next best way is through the Yellow Pages or newspaper ads. She added, though, that you should be wary of advertised rates, because so many variables exist that could alter how much you will pay.
