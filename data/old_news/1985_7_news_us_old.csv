A half-dozen basic responses: 1. Close down the pirates' haven that is the Beirut airport. The previous Reagan reaction to terrorism -fist-shaking warnings and tiptoeing backdowns after embassy bombings and the massacre of marines - has been a disastrous failure. Since our restraint has been taken as weakness, this is the time for the ordering of all Americans out of the country, a final demand for the return of the kidnapped seven, a brief airport evacuation notice, followed by the destruction of the control tower, runways, garages and fuel storage tanks. 2. Get the killers. By wearing masks at their press conference, the murderers manifested their fear of capture. But their identities are no secret. A high monetary award posted for their apprehension, as lawyer Lloyd Cutler suggests, might prove attractive to associates who were not above stealing the hostages' jewelry and cash. Thieves fall out: a big bounty from a ''Stethem Fund'' would drive a wedge into Hezbollah ranks. 3. Let the Greek Government go it alone. Greece had one of the three original hijackers in its hands at Athens airport. Instead of interrogating him to obtain details of the terrorist organization to prevent future attacks, Prime Minister Papandreou made his craven side deal of appeasement, hastily trading him for the Greek passengers - thereby giving the hijackers their first success and increasing the danger to the rest of the international passengers.",1985-07-04T05:00:00+0000

The crew members were John L. Testrake, pilot; Philip G. Maresca, co-pilot, and Benjamin C. Zimmermann, flight engineer. Q. Did you develop sympathy for the captors? MR. MARESCA: No, I did not. I developed a sympathy for the Lebanese people in general. We are released now but many of the Lebanese people are still held captive in circumstances that are effectively anarchy. There is no government in Lebanon now and these people have to run a very thin line between these 18 or 19 various groups that control various aspects, various areas within Lebanon. It's these people we developed a certain empathy for in their daily lives. Q. (Unintelligible). MR. TESTRAKE: They had gone through the cabin looking for identities. They were alert for United States military. They had two of them that they tied up at separate times and brought forward and put them in the cockpit. They beat on them quite severely. They wrenched one of the arms off Mr. Zimmermann's flight-engineer's chair and used that as a club to beat these young men.

Also, securities to be exchanged for the stock carry terms that restrict future debt CBS could assume. Mr. Turner's offer would raise CBS's debt far beyond the level permitted under these terms.

But ''Art on the Beach'' is going out with a bang; in fact, this year's incarnation (through Sept. 13) seems the most vigorous yet. Boasting no fewer than 10 collaborative groups - the largest number ever - it includes, besides the work of painters and sculptors, that of architects, engineers, composers, poets, choreographers, playwrights, directors, musicians and dancers.

One State Department official, commenting on the lack of support from West European allies, said ''the silence is deafening.'' [Page 1, Column 6.] An unmanned submarine found several large pieces of the Air-India Boeing 747 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Ireland June 23. A panel believed to contain recording devices that may hold clues about what destroyed the plane was among the chunks of debris found on a four-mile stretch of the ocean floor by the remote-controlled submarine. The pieces included parts of the cabin, galley and tail, and what appear to bodies of some of the 329 victims. [1:5-6.] A medical panel ruled that two white physicians in South Africa who examined the black activist Steve Biko before his death were guilty of improper conduct. The panel also said one of the doctors displayed ''disgraceful behavior'' while treating Mr. Biko during his detention. [1:3.] Loyal troops foiled a coup against Col.

But analysts were disappointed by a decline in factory employment and slow growth in nonfarm payrolls. When taken with other recent figures - on car sales, trade, inventories and the ''flash'' G.N.P. - the report suggests that the economy is soft enough for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy further. There was, however, a small gain in the length of the factory workweek. [Page 1.] Employment rose in the New York metropolitan area, but job growth is slowing. [7.] Markets The basic money supply jumped $2.6 billion in the week ended June 24, far more than the market had expected. The news dimmed a bond market rally brought on by weakness in the unemployment report. Still, bond prices closed a point and a half higher than Wednesday, the previous day of trading. While economic weakness could encourage lower interest rates, the Fed is also concerned that rapid increases in the money supply would cause inflation. [27.] Stock prices marched higher in very light activity. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.06 points, to 1,334.45, just shy of the record on Monday of 1,337.14. Broader measures did set records. Trading was the slowest of the year, at 62.5 million shares. [31.] The dollar fell in light trading although a late upturn brought it above the day's lows.

On the morning of his departure a young emigrant named Carmine Iannace picked up his heavy suitcases and, accompanied by his father and other men from the village, walked slowly down the road toward the station to await the afternoon train for Naples, where he would later board a steamship bound for that magnetic land that the Italians called ''La Merica.'' Carmine Iannace's father, an impoverished farmer whose only asset was his family, had been devastated by his son's determination to leave; and even before reaching the train station the father abruptly turned around and, without a word or a handshake or a wave of goodbye, started back toward the village. The confused and saddened son, watching in tears, called out to his father. But the older man kept walking, and the only comment that followed came from one of the village men who explained: ''You are now an emigrant. From today forward you are completely on your own.'' What happened to Carmine Iannace in America at the turn of the century, together with the experiences of several other Italians who were sufficiently driven and desperate to break their village ties and their parents' hearts and to endure the abusive life at the bottom of the American pecking order, is the basis of this fine new book by Michael La Sorte. Although the author is a professor of sociology at the State University of New York, Brockport, this book is unburdened by academic language, excessive statistics and the distant view that many learned Italian-Americans take when writing about the humble life of their emigrating forebears.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SHANGHAI. By Christopher New. (Summit, $19.95.) ''So this is China,'' the Englishman John Denton thinks as he approaches Shanghai for the first time. We hope so. After all, this is no ordinary city he is entering. It is Shanghai at the turn of the century, a city with about as strong a romantic and mysterious resonance as one can find - it even gave its name to a form of kidnapping. This is the city we expect to find, reflecting the atmosphere of Josef von Sternberg's film ''Shanghai Express.'' The massive novel follows Denton's career as it ebbs and flows and intertwines with 50 years of Shanghai's turbulent political and economic history. On the surface, it would appear that Christopher New has provided enough color to sustain his nearly 900 pages. Among other things, Denton takes a gorgeous Chinese mistresss; gains, loses and regains a fortune; marries an American socialite; gets elected to the city council; races ponies; and even, at one point, hides Zhou Enlai in his kitchen. There is also an assorted cast of British and Chinese characters from the straitlaced to the devious, the most vivid of whom is Denton's Chinese mistress, the worldly-wise singsong girl Su-mei. But ultimately what is lacking in this book is not the right character types or even the correct street names but passion. Mr. New seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to throw himself into this teeming world. Although we learn something about the ways and means of this city, particularly about the British Customs Service, these are just facts.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE SLAVE'S NARRATIVE. By Charles T. Davis and Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Oxford University, $27.95.) American slavery may have produced the largest and most controversial body of slave narratives in history. ''The Slave's Narrative'' - edited by Charles T. Davis, who before his death in 1981 was a professor of English and chairman of Afro-American studies at Yale University, and Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor of English and African studies at Cornell - presents a sample of the critical response to that literature. It contains a variety of documents ranging from 18th-century book reviews to recent scholarly essays. Among the generally first-rate previously unpublished articles, Jean Fagan Yellin's is outstanding. Not only does her authentication of a female slave's narrative have vast implications for narrative scholarship, it is the only essay that deals with a female writer, even though 12 percent of the antebellum publications were by women. Perhaps the neglect of slave women's narratives results from the editors' choice of ''a certain 'structural' approach'' to unify this interdisciplinary volume. Still, this neglect weakens the claim of representativeness. The omission of slave autobiographies published after 1865 is also surprising. Mr. Gates's argument that when slavery was abolished the slave-narrative structure and rhetorical strategies changed, is a curious reason to ignore years of slave testimony. Furthermore, the book contains a bibliography of antebellum narratives that includes life histories of free blacks who do not mention slavery and five essays about the Works Progress Administration interviews collected in the 1930's.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Goldkorn is working as a house musician at the Steinway Restaurant on New York's Lower East Side on the night two gun-wielding Puerto Ricans hold the staff and patrons hostage. The tale, a melange of comedy, pathos and subdued horror, is thematically linked to the Holocaust. The narrator writes: ''Our antagonists stepped into the crowd of Jews and began to rip from their bodies the last shreds of their garments. Now there were plentiful screams, wailing, and exclamations. . . . All of us, musicians, waiters, patrons, were huddled together, as if on the lip of some common grave.''

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE NEW KGB: Engine of Soviet Power. By William R. Corson and Robert T. Crowley. (Morrow, $19.95.) Despite its title, this book is mainly a history of the Soviet security and intelligence apparatus, rounded out by a retelling of some of the organization's more notorious exploits in Britain and the United States. The chapters on the methods employed by Soviet agents in ferreting out the West's industrial and military secrets are particularly timely, what with recent arrests of a number of Americans accused of spying for Moscow. But the book's message lies elsewhere. The authors, who claim a combined 70 years' experience in military intelligence, contend that the K.G.B. has taken over control of the Soviet Communist Party and ''now operates the U.S.S.R.'' They concede that this view puts them at odds with many ''traditional'' American scholars who see the party as still firmly in charge, and they provide little real evidence in support of their own opinion. Their conclusions are more a matter of interpreting Soviet political dynamics as holding out little hope for any improvement in East-West relations. American ventures in detente, trade and scientific exchange are dismissed as delusions that have made it that much easier for the K.G.B., beefed up before his death last year by the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, to carry out his ukase -massive filching of Western high technology to modernize and expand the Soviet armed forces.

The 83 pictures of ''The Americans'' were immediately recognized as politically charged and formally innovative, although not in ways that jibed with the cautious climate of the 1950's. Today, however, ''The Americans'' is a universally acknowledged classic, a watershed in the medium's postwar evolution from putatively objective to openly subjective ways of envisioning the world.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Cotton Mather entered Harvard in 1674, when he was 11 1/2 years old - the youngest student in the college's history. As pastor of Boston's North Church, he wrote 70 sermons a year and published 388 historical, polemical, scientific and theological works. The archetypal Puritan, he is remembered for having helped create the witchcraft furor of the 1690's. This is his first comprehensive biography, according to our reviewer, Larzer Ziff, and ''a remarkable achievement.'' It won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for biography and Bancroft Prize. PILGRIM'S WAY, by John Buchan. (Carroll & Graf, $10.95.) The thriller writer John Buchan (Lord Tweeds-muir) was at various times an intelligence officer, a Member of Parliament, Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and Governor General of Canada. He wrote the classic ''Thirty-Nine Steps'' as his 39th book. In 1940 our reviewer, Peter Monro Jack, described ''Pilgrim's Way'' as ''a book of great beauty and strength, the book of the year in autobiography, and a distinguished additon to the few first-rate autobiographies in the English language.'' Buchan died in 1940 at the age of 64. WALL TO WALL, by Douglas Woolf. (The Dalkey Archive Press, Elmwood Park, Ill., $4.50.)

Hofmann, born in 1876, was at the height of his peculiar and fascinating career hailed by many as the greatest pianist in the world. This was a serious estimate: Rachmaninoff, for instance, was one of the hailers. But his highly personal style, rooted in 19th-century assumptions about music, was on its way out of favor, and after the final, troubled phase of his public activity, his name and way of playing were quietly set to one side by the shapers of postwar musical opinion. He himself was not exactly forgotten, but what he had embodied was.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

Take almost any American history textbook in print - the story is event-filled for the 17th century, when the first British colonies were founded, and then again for the years after 1763 as the Revolution began to develop. But accounts of the period between have a curiously static quality. Dates all but disappear, as if there were no continuous narrative to tell; chapters are organized not chronologically but topically, with units on society, politics, religion. The character of the early 18th century is conveyed more pointedly through images, drawn, until very recent times, almost exclusively from white, British America - Benjamin Franklin in a beaver hat, a placid Pennsylvania countryside, the balanced facade of a James River plantation house. Such an America could produce only the conservative Revolution described by historians of a generation ago, a Revolution meant not to bring change but to preserve an established good life from the threat of change.",1985-07-07T05:00:00+0000

us,  WILL THE TRADE DEFICIT GO AWAY OR DOES IT NEED A SHOVE?,"DISMAYED by surging imports which they blame for severe industrial unemployment, many members of Congress are demanding reprisals against countries that subsidize exports or set up barriers to goods from the United States. But with the dollar sliding in value last week against the Japanese and European currencies, some experts were predicting that the balance of trade would improve all by itself. There is certainly plenty of room for improvement. Last year, the United States trade deficit topped $123 billion, triple the imbalance in 1981. Since then, the deficit with developing countries has widened by more than $35 billion; with Europe, nearly $30 billion; with Japan, nearly $19 billion, and with Canada, $13 billion. In the face of such statistics, can free-trade theories retain their support? Clyde Farnsworth, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, discussed this and related issues with John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Democrat of Michigan, one of the states hardest hit by foreign competition, and Bill Frenzel, Republican of Minnesota, a self-described ''free-trader'' and member of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. Excerpts follow. Question. Is this a new situation? Answer. This year, our trade imbalance is going to hit something on the order of $170 billion. For the first time, this country has become a net debtor nation. That hasn't been the case since 1914 or so. Q. What does that mean? A. If countries want to start pulling money out of this country, they can hurt us.",1985-07-14T05:00:00+0000

TOTING up weapons has been a favorite pastime in the nuclear weapons debate. There are more than enough numbers to go around. To buttress the case for building and deploying the intercontinental MX missile, for example, supporters of the missile can compare United States and Soviet missile payload capacity - where the Soviet Union has a clear advantage. Critics have recourse to the total number of warheads and bombs, a category in which the United States has the lead.

I am told that seats can be reserved in this country only from Paris to Lyons and the rest must be reserved when I get to Paris. Is this true? - A. R., Queens. Answer: It sounds as if your travel agent may be reluctant to make the reservations. The secretary of the Eurailpass Committee in New York, Dag Scher, says that seat reservations for the journey can be made from this country. He advises a traveler facing this problem to get in touch with the railroad offfice that sold the Eurailpass and ask it to book the seats. Although a Eurailpass permits unlimited train travel in 16 countries, there are only four issuing offices for the passes in this country -the offices of the French, West German, Italian and Swiss railroads. The name of the railroad that sells a pass is stamped on the back of it. Normally it takes about two weeks to confirm reservations on a European train, says Mr. Scher, but on some popular routes - Paris-Lyons, for example - they can sometimes be arranged in 48 hours.",1985-07-14T05:00:00+0000

The author believes his 131 key words disclose social and cultural history in the way they have come to be used. In 1976 Denis Donoghue, reviewing an earlier edition of the book, wrote here that he was troubled because the chosen words ''embody social and political attitudes, patterns and prejudices of conduct at large. Private feeling is mostly ignored.'' But he termed ''splendid'' the ''local insights,'' especially when Mr. Williams ''finds usage crossing the border between specific recognition and abstract relationship,'' as illustrated by the change from ''customer'' to ''consumer.'' THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, by John Updike. (Fawcett Crest, $4.50.) The witches are three divorced, middle-class, otherwise ordinary women in a small town, Eastwick, R.I., the site of their sorcery. Margaret Atwood observed last year in The Book Review that the witches may be products of ''Eastwick's -read America's - own fantasy life,'' She applauded ''the skill and inventiveness of the writing, the accuracy of the detail, the sheer energy of the witches and, above all, the practicality of the charms.'' PICASSO: The Complete Writings, by Gertrude Stein. (Beacon, $7.95.) Gertrude Stein met the 24-year-old artist when she was 31. Their friendship lasted 41 years. ''Picasso,'' originally published as ''Gertrude Stein on Picasso,'' is a documentary record of that relationship. Included are her 1938 essay on the painter and notes from unpublished notebooks. James R. Mellow wrote here that the essay, while not the most informative work on Picasso, is ''easily the most ingratiating: warm, discursive, full of vivid anecdotes, charming insights and . . . breathtaking generalizations.''",1985-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Called Forum '85, the 1,000 workshops were focused on the themes of ''equality, development and peace.'' According to high-ranking United Nations officials, they were chosen in large part to satisfy the three factions into which the conference has divided: equality for the Western group, development for the third world and peace for the Eastern group. Most of the paragraphs on peace and disarmament in the official document of the conference to be discussed this week were Soviet-inspired. From the start, many of the workshops were marked by disputes between representatives of nations involved in disputes, such as Iraq and Iran.

The invitation in those lines from ''The Play'' is irresistible. And the most enthralling hour of poetry in town now, and a magnificent moment of theater, is Salome Jens's enactment of 21 Sexton poems in ''. . . About Anne'' at the Women's Art Center. Her performance recalls the outlines of Mrs. Sexton's life, but what is more important, it reminds one of the sweep and range of her art, the leaping metaphors and startling images. For unlike some other stagings of Mrs. Sexton's poetry - her writings have been turned into drama and opera several times in the last 10 years - Miss Jens's concentrates not on the neurosis and eventual suicide of the poet in 1974, but on her poetry. Miss Jens's sense of a poetic line and her confident delivery of hundreds of them is most gratifying.",1985-07-17T05:00:00+0000

There was good reason for this - the benches were solid indeed, and teak with its high natural oil content could withstand the elements all year round without finish or maintenance. It was also a convenient way of recycling the enormous amount of decking salvaged from the scrapped naval vessels and merchant ships left over from World War I. When left to its own resources, teak will gradually weather down and take on a silvery-gray look, one that blends in well in a garden setting. The more formal spic-and-span look resembling light straw was the order of the day for decking at sea, and this was achieved simply by using a salt water hose and stiff-bristle brooms or holystones - pieces of sandstone used for scrubbing a ship's deck. Badly soiled areas would be treated with hot fresh water, soft soap and washing soda, and a stiff scrubbing.",1985-07-18T05:00:00+0000

The traditional presentation is ''The Art of Cameroon'' at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street (through Oct. 15), and the innovative one - as might be guessed from the title - is ''Sets, Series and Ensembles in African Art,'' at the Center for African Art, 54 East 68th Street (through Oct. 20).",1985-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE STORY OF AVIS. By Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. Edited by Carol Farley Kessler. (Rutgers University Press, Cloth, $25. Paper, $10.) Elizabeth Stuart Phelps became a popular author in 1867, at the age of 23, with a rhapsodic first novel about heaven, ''The Gates Ajar.'' Then followed cautionary tales about talented women trapped by marriage and domestic routine. ''The Story of Avis'' (1877) is one of these. In this scholarly reissue it shows us a curious but common type of 19th-century middle-class feminism. Avis is a brilliant art student whose plans to pursue a career are thwarted by love and marriage. Although her husband, Philip, has vowed to respect her ambitions, he breaks his promise by failing to earn enough money to provide her with servants. Burdened with household responsibilities, Avis also faces the rapid cooling of Philip's ardor which (both she and the author agree) was only her due. Given the possibilities for inadvertent humor, the story moves with surprising power toward a gloomy finale that leaves Avis a careworn widow with a child to support and her genius wasted. In addition to the conflict between marriage and career - a new motif in women's fiction at that time - Phelps warns that a gifted woman's worst enemy is not society or men but her own disposition to give herself entirely, and for life, to the first man who arouses her. Unless careful training controls this tendency, she can only be the victim of her own ''supreme capacity of love.''",1985-07-21T05:00:00+0000

As a sportswriter for The Toronto Star, Alison Gordon covered the Toronto Blue Jays for five years, from spring training of the third year of the baseball franchise's existence (1979) until the end of the 1983 season. Watching an inept and luckless expansion team grow into a pennant contender, she got to know, as she puts it, ''a raft of fascinating people,'' and describing those people is what Miss Gordon does best. Of course, she is obliged to include stories about what it is like to be a woman working in the macho world of baseball, particularly doing the locker room interviews essential to a sportswriter's job. She tells these tales but gathers them into one token chapter, as if she got bored, the way most female sportswriters eventually do, with voyeuristic questions about the locker room. ''No one wanted to talk about what the job was like, what the real challenges were,'' she writes. ''They didn't want to talk baseball. All they wanted to know was whether I saw lots of naked men.'' But her job amounted to much more than that, and ''Foul Ball!'' is about what it is like to cover baseball, not about what it is like to be a woman covering baseball. Some might argue that the author herself - a woman who turned 40, got married and pursued various nonsports interests during the time that she covered the Blue Jays - is a more interesting subject than the people she has written about.",1985-07-21T05:00:00+0000

Ideologists define terrorism to their own ends, while the United Nations, the documentary notes, has been unwilling to define it at all. Most reasonable people, however, need no definition; they recognize terrorism when they see it. Terrorism is a bombing, an assassination, a hijacked plane.

Largely because of Mr. Rohmer and a number of other directors who came into their own during this period, foreigners came to expect that French movies were ones in which little or nothing happened. Characters, corseted into suits one size too small, moved about in small rooms or tiny gardens and occasionally traveled short distances in miniature cars or stuffy railroad compartments, living lives that could fit on the head of a pin.

His collaborator for the evening, Andre Watts, seemed a curious choice. Indeed, they are such different musicians that the Mozart E Flat Concerto (K. 271) - in which Mr. Leppard conducted and Mr. Watts played the piano solos -promised to be a confrontation of styles rather than a meeting of minds and hearts. We value Mr. Watts, that is, for his irrepressible exuberance and his communicative powers, while Mr. Leppard's immediacy of feeling seems always tempered and shaped by a second set of ears listening reflectively from a slight distance.",1985-07-21T05:00:00+0000

Small farms, he argues, mean a healthier soil and better and less expensive produce. Our reviewer, Douglas Unger, wrote last year that the book ''is rich with descriptions of on-the-farm experiences, and it is informed by a knowledge of the exhaustive work that goes along with farming's rewards. . . . 'Gaining Ground' is an inspiring link between two estranged cultures'' - the farmer and the consumer. BUDDING PROSPECTS: A Pastoral, by T. Coraghes-san Boyle. (Penguin, $6.95.)

And as rock gathered a more and more massive audience throughout the 60's and 70's, it was difficult for any uncompromising jazz artist to attract the interest of America's major record labels.

He falls in with the scions of the horsey set who instead snort horse - more commonly called heroin - and are all very unhappy. Failed romance shoves him back to Beirut, where he caroms between scenes of death in an unhappiness of global scale. Remarkably, this unpromising plot takes on life in the hands of James Buchan, a former Middle East correspondent for The Financial Times. It is a pale kind of life, though, peopled by Chelsea trendies and their parents, none sketched with more than two or three lines; Arab fighters, drivers and hoteliers who sound too much alike in their flowery speech; old British spook types who leave so much to the imagination that we aren't sure, two pages thence, whether we really met them at all. The grace of this minimalist first novel is in its unbroken swiftness: we are unbound from the weight of realistically depicted places and the suety waste of real people's talk; we move at the speed of Adam Murray's sharp mind. The problem is that we are unbound, too, from almost everyone who scurries through these chapters. We have only hints of past pain in the life of his lover, his ''dream tart,'' Mary Mark; we are not even quite clear what she looks like; he wants her but we are not sure why; she comes to grief, but do we care? Mr. Buchan's prose is spare and stylish, his dialogue leaves most things unsaid, his descriptions of London town houses, British manors or Beirut bunkers make us hold with our teeth to one or two details - we try to chew and bite mostly air.",1985-07-21T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"PINDAR. By D. S. Carne-Ross. (Yale University, Cloth, $25. Paper, $7.95.) It was long the fashion among scholars to say Pindar was the greatest Greek lyric poet but he could only be understood by scholars. He is a tough case: his chosen vehicle, the victory ode presented in elaborate public ceremony, did not survive him, nor did the musical and choreographic components of his poems. But D. S. Carne-Ross, who teaches classics at Boston University, assumes that a reader who can comprehend poetry at all can understand Pindar, and he opens up the work of the great Theban more clearly than anyone has yet done in English. The challenge was great. Mr. Carne-Ross's ''Pindar'' is one of two inaugural volumes (the other is Paolo Vivante's ''Homer'') in a new series, Hermes Books, intended to make the ancient writers available to readers with little or no Greek or Latin. And if the author had not succeeded so well one would have said it could not be done with Pindar. First he draws on the best recent scholarship to describe the structure of the odes, which he compares to classical sonatas. Then, in close readings of a handful of the 45 surviving odes - readings considerably enhanced by his translations and his use of a tremendous range of reference to modern poetry - he makes the reader familiar with Pindar's dramatic instinct, his exuberance, his love of wit and surprise, his sense of humor and his incomparable technical skill. Mr. Carne-Ross doesn't make Pindar easy, but he does make him understandable, even natural.",1985-07-21T05:00:00+0000

JOIN UPDIKE, MAILER, OATES...","ON a bleak day in the winter of 1843-44 in New York City a dark, slender, fine-boned man with a look of frayed elegance presented himself at the offices of Graham's Magazine, a journal he himself had edited until recently, and submitted to his former boss, George Graham, some verses he had written. Graham found no merit in them, but when the poet protested that he and his wife were nearly destitute, the publisher charitably decided to let his staff deliver the final verdict. And so, be-fore an impromptu jury of editors, office boys and pressmen, the poet declaimed his work. Graham's employees were no more enraptured than Graham, but taking pity on their old colleague, they softened the rejection by collecting $15 to ease his poverty. Such was the earliest known flight of Edgar Allan Poe's poem ''The Raven.'' Poe's excruciating experience at Graham's is only an extreme example of a conflict that has probably gone on, in some form or other, since the invention of the printing press. Laurence Sterne's ''Tristram Shandy'' went begging (publishers, as was said at the time, ''would not have anything to say to it, nor would they offer any price for it,'') until the author could raise a partial subsidy. Charles Lamb was driven to a fury by dismissive editors (''When my sonnet was rejected, I exclaimed, 'Damn the age' '').

At that time most of them were bound for Israel, but in the years that followed an increasing number opted for the United States, and by the end of the 1970's some 65,000 of them had made their home here. Not long after their arrival, the William E.

One of the interviewers involved in the project was Miss Rothchild, who has now woven their testimony into a fascinating collective portrait.",1985-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,  A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE,"BUFFALO Sunlight was sinking behind the first-base stands at War Memorial Stadium, low enough at the start of the game between the Omaha Royals and the Buffalo Bisons that the batter stood in shadows while the pitcher stood in the light. Dave Cone, a hard-throwing right-hander for the Royals, threw an inside fastball to Ron Kittle of the Bisons, a pitch Kittle never saw. He just leaned back, and the ball buzzed under his elbow. ""I thought, 'That's all I need. Get hit in the head,' "" Kittle said. He is scheduled to return to the Chicago White Sox this morning, less than a week after he was sent here for the rehabilitation of shoulder miseries that have existed since April. Kittle's sense of perspective tells him that he will start a new part of the season, that a batting average of .195, based on just 149 times at bat, can rise dramatically with a few swings. But his memory provides the reminder that a fastball in the head is about the only circumstance he has not discovered during this dismal year. His story had once been an unacceptable movie plot, because there was too little for anyone to believe. Spinal-fusion surgery had ended his baseball career. He returned to Gary, Ind., to become an iron and steel worker until the White Sox rediscovered him, gave him a tryout, and watched him become the American League rookie of the year in 1983. He hit 67 home runs in his first two full major league seasons to match Frank Robinson for the sixth-highest total for the first two years. This season, at the age of 27, Kittle has had to confront the expectation to play when his body says it cannot. He ran into the left-field wall at Comiskey Park chasing a fly ball April 20, and several times since he has wondered how much damage was being done. He has known the confusion of being able to hit home runs in batting practice, and soon after being unable to comb his hair. ""I was getting depressed,"" he said. ""I didn't want to go to the ball yard. I couldn't carry a gallon of milk from the grocery store."" The report from the White Sox continues to be that Kittle suffers from a sore shoulder. He feels the golf ball-size lump that sat on his right shoulder blade not long ago provided evidence of something more severe. ""If that's an inflamed shoulder,"" he said, ""I'd hate to see a broken shoulder."" And then came the news, last month, when the team was in Seattle. The first child for Ron and Laurie Kittle, a girl, had died at birth. That night, he flew home. ""It was the most depressing thing I ever did in my life,"" he said. ""It was a hard experience to explain. I love kids. I'd trade every penny I've made for a baby."" Suddenly a painful shoulder and the opinions of management did not seem very important anymore. Roland Hemond, the general manager, said Kittle had not been accused of being unwilling to play. ""I don't know if they were questioning me or not,"" Kittle said. ""I didn't care anymore. I have a lot of talent. I can hit a ball as hard or harder than anyone in baseball."" There was the day he was needed to play left field, and told Tony LaRussa, the manager, he could not. ""I said, 'I can't throw,' "" Kittle said. ""I just told him plain as that."" The response, he said, was that he could make shorter throws to a cutoff man. ""If I get the ball hit to me,"" he said, ""I'm going to try to throw somebody out, and it's going to hurt. He's not inside my body. He didn't have the pain. Being a professional athlete, you're going to have aches and pains. But it was just getting to the point where I wasn't concentrating on baseball. Believe me, I think I know better. ""Why should I go out at 50 percent, and have somebody steal bases on me, and have them say, 'Kittle can't throw'? There were probably 50 percent of the fans could throw the ball farther than I could. That's when I said I've got to worry about nobody else but me."" He was placed on the disabled list and sent here, a trip that seems almost like a vacation. Kittle said he had had more fun this week than he had all season. He was batting .438 for the Bisons before he was hitless in five times at bat lastnight, but that was not important. He said his shoulder felt as good as it had since April. Kittle teased small children until they ran in fright, turned around, and came back giggling for more. He kibitzed as he collected baseballs during batting practice and tossed them in the direction of the shopping basket near the mound. He lingered in the clubhouse with teammates from past minor league teams who have been less fortunate. He remembered how Jose Castro of the Bisons had once been the victim of his success. Kittle hit 50 home runs at Edmonton in 1982. Castro batted behind Kittle, often when home runs had left pitchers in a less than pleasant frame of mind. ""His whole body was black and blue,"" Kittle said. Soon he will be home again, close to his one-acre pond stocked with fish in his backyard, ready to start his season again. ""I'm kind of nervous to go back up there,"" he said. ""Not really nervous. Excited."" He has always remembered that the White Sox gave him that chance, took him out of the mills, made him a hometown hero, and paid him more money than he ever dreamed he'd make. Now he will always remember that there are more important things. - PLAYERS",1985-07-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"IN THE CLEAR LIGHT. By Fiona Kidman. (Norton, $13.95.) A mournful, elegiac quality runs through this novel, as if all the characters were dead before the story began. And in some sense this is true, for the lives of these people, spent in New Zealand just before and during World War II, are pitifully thwarted and blighted. The women stand for countless hours on queues for rations to feed husbands they don't love and children they didn't want. During the war, they maintain a dreary respectability or sell themselves to soldiers. The men work hopelessly in the ''swampy peatland'' and the gold mines and later go off to die in the Pacific. The children wander aimlessly, begging for ''choc-lit.'' The novel's central character is Clara, born late in life to an incompetent mother and raised carelessly by an indiffer-ent older sister. Clara endures a barren and often baffling childhood on the wrong side of the tracks, flowers briefly in a passionate but doomed romance with a golden boy from the right side and withers quickly into degradation and despair in exile from her hometown. She lives fast, becoming old and wise at 20, having learned all there is to know about love with the help of a noble black Yank. When Clara looks back on her childhood, reconstructing her parents' and sister's lives, she is imaginative and generous, and the melancholy tone of the story seems earned and is often moving.",1985-07-28T05:00:00+0000

us,  THE INFLUENCE OF CHANEL,"MOST CLOTHES-CONSCIOUS WOMEN ARE AWARE OF THE CHANEL style, if only obliquely. So strong was the statement made by the late Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel in her heyday that vestiges of it have been showing up ever since. Her ornamental accessories - bow-tied hair ribbons; cascades of gold chains, stones and pearls; double-cuff bracelets; chain belts; quilted bags - have become basics. So has the use of wool jersey and soft tweeds to sculpture suits as pliable as sweater sets. The little Chanel suit look - cardigan jacket with a high, snug armhole and contrasting piping, the neat skirt ending below the knee - has been copied up and down the price spectrum, and has come to stand for a safe way to dress properly. In truth, its saturation had taken the Chanel look from the peaks of chic in the early 1930's to the depths of banality by the early 1980's. There were a few exceptions. When Mademoiselle Chanel came out of retirement in the 1950's, for one. And later, when designers such as Yves Saint Laurent and Sonia Rykiel have occasionally reworked the Chanel concept. But though the house of Chanel had remained in operation since Mademoiselle's death in 1971, the credit for keeping the legend alive really belongs to New York's Adolfo, who kept churning out variations of the Chanel theme.
