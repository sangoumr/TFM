He dedicated his life to teaching others to help themselves and their communities. Driven by the social gospel to serve those in need, he was a vigorous advocate for programs benefiting the elderly, and a prolific developer of low-income housing. Father Lott asked others to reach for goals that would intimidate most, and his sermons and liturgies inspired those around him to put God's words into action. Born in the Bronx on November 23, 1939, Father Lott was raised in St. Frances of Rome Parish in Wakefield. He studied at All Hallows High School, and graduated from Iona College. Shortly after, he entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie and was ordained on May 29, 1965. After ordination, he pursued advanced studies in Liturgy and earned a Master's Degree in Sacred Scripture. His first assignment was at St. John the Evangelist in White Plains, where he worked with the New York Apostolate for the Deaf. Father Lott served as Assistant Pastor of St. Peter's in Yonkers and St. Joseph's of Greenwich Village. While at St. Joseph's, he co-founded and served as Chairman of the Caring Community, and he led that organization in the purchase of Village Nursing Home. Father Lott was a former member of Planning Board II, and the co-founder and former Chairman of The Council of Senior Centers and Services. He was appointed Pastor of St. Francis de Sales Parish on East 96th Street in July of 1987, and Administrator of St. Lucy's Parish in 1998. At the former, he operated a soup kitchen and a shelter for the homeless. During the past fifteen years, he founded and served as Chairman of the Board and President of the SFDS Development Corporation. Through that not-forprofit organization, he developed over 700 low-income housing units in East Harlem ranging from housing for the homeless to a model assisted living facility for the elderly on Fifth Avenue. The Caring Community, Presbyterian Homes, and Village Care of New York have all honored him as Man of the Year. Last year he was presented with the Maggie Kuhn Award.

Mrs. Paris-Kronberg lived a life of great passion and adventure. She was born in Istanbul, Turkey and was raised in Athens, Greece. She was a professional ballerina and popular dancer in the 1940's in Europe. She and her husband Henri, a restaurateur, lived in Paris with their two sons until they moved to the United States in the mid 1950's. Widowed in her 40's, Mrs. ParisKronberg began an haute couture dress business in the 1960's, under the name of Nina Dimos, maintaining an atelier in Paris and a showroom on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her clients included many high profile doyennes of the time. Her dresses have been sold recently at auction at Sotheby's. She married her long-time companion Louis Kronberg, the founder of Club ABC Tours. They both traveled extensively throughout the world. Upon the death of her husband she took the position of CEO of Club ABC Tours. Though Mrs. Paris-Kronberg valued tradition and manners greatly, she had an unconventional way of seeing the world and appreciated others who did as well. She moved with grace and lit her ever-present pipe with panache and elegance. Her philosophy of life had elements of the romantic, the practical and the poetic. Her sense of humor was unparalleled to the last days of her life. She battled her illness with great courage and fortitude. She was not one to give in to life's challenges. She met and conquered them. Eventually this final obstacle could not be overcome. She died bravely and with a conviction that life was to be lived to the fullest. Mrs. Paris-Kronberg is survived by her two sons Tom and Robert, their wives, and seven grandchildren. She also leaves one sister, Ellia McInnis, and her niece, Nina Ingold and family.

But for many homeowners, the increase was more than offset by the NJ Saver rebate, a property tax relief program; the average rebate more than doubled from $240 to $500, according to the treasury department. The tax-relief checks are scheduled to increase this year to an average $600. However, the rebate program is under scrutiny as state officials work to close a budget gap that could reach $6 billion for the next fiscal year. That same budget gap is forcing a freeze in most municipal and school aid, which could trigger more property tax increases, said William Dressel, executive director of the League of Municipalities.

us,An Accidental Truce,"James McBride's affecting historical novel, MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA (Riverhead, $24.95), follows a brief period in the life of four ''Buffalo Soldiers'' from the Army's all-black 92nd Division. These soldiers are stranded for several days in late 1944 in the Italian town of Bornacchi. In this interval from fighting, as the four Americans become acquainted with the villagers and partisan Italian fighters battling the Germans, the personalities of the men emerge. The gentle and artless draftee Sam Train, who convinces himself that in battle he is invisible, has hands like ''meat cleavers'' and a large head that swivels ''back and forth, moving like the head of a dinosaur.'' Train has taken into his care an Italian boy who survived a German massacre at the village of St. Anna, and he harbors unreasonable ambitions of taking the boy home with him to North Carolina. Other tensions arise within the group. Aubrey Stamps, an educated, chestnut-skinned lieutenant, resents Train's attachment and struggles to make peace with his own black heritage. A bitter enmity grows violent between Stamps and the soldier Bishop Cummings -- a swindling preacher who Stamps believes represents all those ''who acted just like whitey wanted them to act.'' The book's final catastrophe is set in motion by the Army's Jim Crow-style racism and its ''unwritten law that no colored should ever be able to tell a white man what to do.'' McBride, whose memoir, ''The Color of Water,'' movingly described his Jewish mother's marriages to two black men and the rearing of 12 children, creates an intricate mosaic of narratives that ultimately becomes about betrayal and the complex moral landscape of war.

Before President Bush decides where next to take the war against terrorism, he and the American people ought to pause for a moment to think about how we intend to behave in this new and awesome role.",2002-03-03T05:00:00+0000

The new assistant commissioner in charge of the state's poorest districts or Abbott schools, Gordon MacInnes, said he anticipated that early childhood education aid for Abbott districts would probably increase, but that in general the schools would face ''a reduction in the rate of increase,'' compared with other years.

The celebrated 1998-2001 Yanks, who barely missed a fourth consecutive championship last fall, could in fact be cited on either side of the argument. On last year's roster, Roger Clemens, Mike Mussina, Scott Brosius, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch were indeed established players ''skimmed off'' (in Headlam's phrase) from other teams before going on to notable achievements in pinstripes. But their contributions to the Bombers' record are matched, in my view, by those of Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Ramiro Mendoza, Jorge Posada, Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and Alfonso Soriano, who are all home-grown Yankees.

The sales staff at the new Dunhill's -- which specializes in men's clothes and accessories, bespoke tailoring, cigars and pipes -- has taken a rigorous course in proper manners at the store's butler school, run by Phillip DeAngelis, the former head butler at the St. Regis Hotel. In the program, Mr. DeAngelis, who trained at the Ivor Spencer School for Butlers in London, which supplies the royals with household help, taught service traditions and values. Those include the right way to give directions (never point but gesture with an open hand); correct forms of address (a princess is first ''your royal highness'' and then ''ma'am''); how to stand at attention when not helping a customer; how to greet clients and escort them to the door; how to tie a perfect bow tie; and, a syllabus says, how to ''problem solve'' without being pompous.

The move left FTD.com investors scratching their heads over what they would receive in the merger. FTD is a unit of the privately held IOS Brands Corporation.

That way, they can place garnishes on the plates in advance, then finish the dishes as orders come in. At home, this could be handy for dinner parties prepared in small kitchens.

Sony said it would begin selling a network adapter, which permits players to play online games through a dial-up modem or a broadband connection, in August for $39.99.

us,Relax. It's Spring.,"After the year we've had, thank God it's spring. Designers obviously factored in all that stress, because what paraded down the runway this season seemed better suited to weekend getaways than corporate power plays. So, if you must wear a suit, take it down a notch, like the guy on our cover: Hayden Christensen. Appearing in the latest ''Star Wars'' spectacle, ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones,'' and on the London stage in Kenneth Lonergan's ''This Is Our Youth,'' Christensen is making a name for himself as Hollywood's latest It Boy and as the model every designer wants to dress. He certainly epitomizes the nonchalance of the season -- lots of lived-in denim, T-shirts and sexy leather jackets, basically the same look that the Rolling Stones bequeathed the world, circa 1971, when they were hanging out in the South of France. (Photographs of that raucous summer, from the book ''Exile,'' decorate our opening pages.)",2002-03-10T05:00:00+0000

His wife, Paula Oland, is head baker at the renowned Balthazar Bakery, of SoHo and Englewood. The two put down roots in this Colonial hamlet just north of Bergen County, and late last year, after a long career as a chef at such restaurants as the Sign of the Dove and Yellowfingers in Manhattan, Mr. Foti opted for a kitchen much closer to home. In the back of a sweetly countrified storefront just big enough for the streams of couples (in BMW's) and small families (in Volvo wagons) who stop in for takeout, he turns out an impressive line of savory dishes. Theres a gorgeous pissaladire, the French pizza ($20 a pie, $5 a quarter); an earthy black bean soup brightened by cherry tomatoes ($4 a pint); a Mediterranean hero with grilled eggplant, fennel and hummus ($6); and a variety of pressed hot sandwiches that are like exalted grilled cheese ($7). Soon, he says, he'll start offering takeout dinners: baked pastas, seafood stews, poultry and vegetarian dishes. Ms. Oland supplies the breads and pastries, which is like having Mike Piazza bat cleanup on your church softball team. Her other clients include an Olympian cast of Manhattan restaurants, among them Jean Georges and Alain Ducasse. A rosemary-sourdough ring big enough for a picnic is just $3. A magnificent 14-inch amber-stout rye is $7.50 and would feed every peasant in a Brueghel painting. Desserts include a terrific, mouth-puckering lemon-souffl tart and a dense, moist chocolate-almond torte ($4.50 each). Oh, the name. It is the title of a 1938 movie by Marcel Pagnol in which the baker stops working because his wife has run off with a shepherd, and the villagers, missing their bread, organize to bring her back.

us,Love Among the Photographers,"The work of the photographer Margrethe Mather might have been lost in photographic history had it not been for a visit to Edward Weston's Los Angeles studio in 1913. Weston, then 27, ''fell in love with art and with Margrethe Mather at the same time, and for some eight years could not separate them,'' as a friend once wrote. Although Weston ultimately burned diary entries pertaining to Mather, photographs and accounts from their decade-long affair are now unveiled in Beth Gates Warren's MARGRETHE MATHER AND EDWARD WESTON: A Passionate Collaboration (Norton, $39.95). Warren dispels notions that theirs was a traditional artist/muse relationship, suggesting that it was in fact Mather who was Weston's mentor. While posing as his model and making her own pictures, Mather exposed Weston to a bohemian circle of anarchists, poets and actors (including a pre-Tramp Charlie Chaplin). The couple eventually photographed in tandem, co-signing portraits of figures like Max Eastman and Carl Sandburg. In her solo work, Mather edited an image to its essence, a skill that undoubtedly inspired her partner. In ''Semi-Nude'' (1923), she made a close-up of hands parting a patterned kimono to reveal a bare torso, an idea for which Weston is remembered -- in nudes of another lover, Tina Modotti, wearing a kimono, and of his son in ''Neil's Torso'' (1925). Shortly before her death in 1952, Mather implored Weston to ''pretend that I didn't exist.'' We can be thankful that she's finally gotten some overdue -- if unwanted -- attention.

There were jeers, too, for the villains: the callous hospital administrator, the rich but indifferent cardiac surgeon and, of course, the sleazy H.M.O. The plot line is thin: John Q.'s little boy suddenly takes ill and needs a heart transplant, but John Q.'s H.M.O. won't cover the costs. His family earns too much to qualify for Medicaid or other assistance, and he has to shell out cash just to keep his son in the intensive-care unit. The hospital threatens to discharge the dying boy. A frustrated John Q. snaps and pulls a gun on the surgeon (to the loudest cheers in the audience) and takes over the E.R. In the end, John Q. prevails.",2002-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Still, the eagerly awaited 25,000-square-foot outpost opens Friday in a new open-air shopping mall in Hollywood called the Grove. Outside the store, a 22-foot four-ton herald-soldier will greet the toddling clientele with waving arms and music. Inside, the company's trademark clock tower has a Tinseltown tweak, with animated bears that resemble cinematic icons like Charlie Chaplin, a reference that seems intended to register more with parents than with children. Although the inventory closely mirrors that of the Fifth Avenue store, which is about three times the size of the Los Angeles store, it offers more trampolines, skateboard ramps and other backyard contraptions ill suited to an urban co-op. On opening day, Reggie Jackson, the former Yankee, and Steve Garvey, the former Los Angeles Dodger, will unveil the rerelease of Mattel's 1978 classic electronic hand-held baseball game -- with luck, to an audience of glamorous celebrity moms, who will lend a new meaning to the phrase ''babes in toyland.''

Others wondered if Mr. Vise was using online discounts to parlay his tome into a hardcover version of pork bellies. The most literary explanation is that Mr. Vise is picking up where Henry David Thoreau left off.

Citing better-than-expected demand in Western Europe and in American stores, International Data raised its projections for growth in unit shipments of desktop and notebook computers to 3 percent from 1.8 percent. Shipments should rise to 125.5 million, from 121.8 million, the company said. All regions of the world except Asia-Pacific surpassed expectations in the fourth quarter of 2001, setting the stage for a mild rebound this year, especially in the second half. In a separate report, International Data predicted that revenue from sales of personal computer chips this year would increase by 3.4 percent, to $37.6 billion, from $36.3 billion. But the report warned that weak demand among corporations, excess chip inventory and fluctuating prices would cause sales to fall through the first half of the year before swinging up in the last six months of 2002.

With 20 games available to start with, Microsoft is trying to regain momentum lost with its tepid introduction last month in Japan, the home turf of its competitors, Sony and Nintendo. Some Xbox consoles scratched game disks, causing a public relations headache for Microsoft and forcing it to offer to replace faulty machines. At $423 in Britain and $419 in Continental Europe, the Xbox costs almost $100 more than Sony's PlayStation2. Schelley Olhava, a senior analyst with the International Data Corporation, said Microsoft stood a better chance in Europe than in Japan because game players there have similar tastes to players in North America.

us,Famous for Being Super,"They're an odd, self-consciously neurotic bunch, one that includes a superhero with skin so unbearably sensitive to others' bodies that their rapid heartbeats or ''the saliva rushing around their mouths'' induces despair -- he plays Russian roulette each evening with a revolver beside his bed. Among their number is also a wolfish boy -- a student of Harold Bloom's -- who is ''able to tear through steel walls with his teeth and claws,'' and there's a peeved African-American whose skin emits flesh- and metal-melting acidic sweat. He declares, ''I'm a black mutant. In this country, that's like being black with a little black added,'' and believes the superhero business is -- well, business: ''Internal conflict. Struggles for ascendancy. Personal enmities. Isn't that the kind of thing that keeps people interested in us? I mean, we can't be fighting bad guys all the time.'' Proceeding from the assumption that given a world containing scores of superheroes, at least one bunch of them will prove to be media-manipulating cynics, we are offered X-FORCE: New Beginnings (Marvel Comics, paper, $14.95), a witty blast of media criticism disguised as a garish spin-off of ''X-Men.'' The writer Peter Milligan assembles a bickering team of mutants who negotiate the TV rights to their rescue of Boyz R Us, a teen-pop group taken hostage. The heroes, as drawn by Mike Allred and inked by Laura Allred in bright, primary colors, are stiffly posed with few facial expressions (frowning anger, teary woundedness) -- a parody of bad comic-book art whose ugliness becomes astute when combined with Milligan's merciless view of humanity. The members of X-Force are celebrities not for the occasional good they do, but merely for dominating the news. As their callously corrupt advisor, Coach, says: ''That's what's so great about today. No one remembers anything any more.'' Harold Bloom couldn't have said it better. Ken Tucker",2002-03-17T05:00:00+0000

The survey -- performed by a unit slated to be closed by the Bush administration -- also found that many streams held traces of hormones from birth control pills and other sources that could harm fish.

James B., 75, Episcopal priest, author, journalist and former public relations account executive, died March 11 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. of complications following a stroke. Born in Arkansas, Fr. Simpson was educated at Northwestern University, the University of Edinburg, Scotland, and Nashota House Episcopal Seminary in Wisconsin. Before entering the priesthood, he worked in the media in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, and reported from London, Lagos, Moscow, Tokyo and Beijing. A resident of Washington, D.C. for the past ten years, Fr. Simpson was a member of the Cosmos Club and was associated with two Washington parishes, the Church of Ascension St. Agnes and All Souls. Before retirement, he was Curate at Christ's Church, Rye, NY, and Rector of Christ Church, Middletown, NJ. He was the Editor of ''The Anglican Digest,'' served as an interim priest in Tokyo, Japan, and was currently a correspondent for the British publications ''The Living Church'' and ''Church Times.'' He was the author of four ''Contemporary Quotations'' books, the first published in 1957 and the last in 1997. His biography, ''The Hundreth Archbishop of Canterbury,'' was listed among the 200 best books of 1962. In the 1990's, Fr. Simpson was listed in ''Who's Who in America.'' A protege of H.V. Kaltenborn, he scripted an early television panel show, ''Who Said That?'' With the late Fr. Edward M. Story, Fr. Simpson co-wrote the first book on the decennial international meeting of Episcopal bishops, ''The Long Shadows of Lambeth X.'' They followed that book ten years later with ''Discerning God's Will: Lambeth XI.'' They also wrote the first comprehensive history of religious orders in the Episcopal church. Currently, Fr. Simpson was working on a pioneering study, ''A Treasury of Anglican Art,'' which is to be published this year. Fr. Simpson's byline has appeared in Look, Reader's Digest, Esquire, Town & Country, Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times Magazine. He is survived by two sisters, Mrs. L.J. Witherspoon, Jackson, MS, and Mrs. Ralph D. Skinner, Homosassa, FL; two nieces, Mary Skinner Murry, Richmond, Virginia, and Jane Phillips, Jackson, MS; two nephews, Matthew Skinner, Ellicott City, MD and Joe Witherspoon, Orlando, FL.

The suit, filed on Monday in the Federal District Court in San Francisco, argues that WorldCom inflated its earnings, revenue and cash flow and that Mr. Ebbers and Mr. Sullivan reaped millions of dollars selling shares before the stock tumbled. WorldCom's shares fell to $18.20 from nearly $49 from Feb. 8, 2000, to Nov. 1, the period covered by the suit. WorldCom officials said the suit was baseless because employees had control over their 401(k) portfolios, including options to have no WorldCom stock.

The rising number of new cases -- 32,000 last year alone -- means that ''we are facing an epidemic,'' Mr. Feshchenko said, adding that control is difficult because many new cases resist standard drug treatment. The situation is made more perilous by the fact that Ukraine's rate of H.I.V. infection, about 1 percent, is expected to rise to as much as 6 percent by 2010, and H.I.V. sufferers' weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to TB.

Mr. Fail and a partner acquired 15 insolvent institutions in 1988 that eventually became Bluebonnet. Their agreement with regulators included a provision that permitted Bluebonnet to maintain capital levels lower than those normally required for 10 years.

The entire Yeshiva University & its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) family express profound sorrow over the passing, in Jerusalem, of its revered senior vice president emeritus. Rabbi Miller was a truly inspiring leader, humanitarian, colleague and mentor to us for more than six decades. He was also a world-renowned Jewish leader and eloquent national and international spokesman for the Jewish people. His leadership skills were rooted in his keen intellect and in his profound grace and humility, which touted all who knew or dealt with him at any level. He championed a myriad of Jewish causes as chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, chairman of the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry, secretary of the International Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, a founder of the Jewish Community Relations Council, president of the Rabbinical Council of America and of the Rabbinical Alumni Association of RIETS, and he was a top officer of nearly every other major Jewish organization in New York and the nation. As president of of the Conference of Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, his tireless energies helped achieve a landmark compensation agreement for the criminal theft and plunder that was part of the barbarity of the Holocaust. The legacy that his labors and commitment to the Jewish people left for the survivors of the Holocaust is timeless and immeasurable. For more than 25 years, he provided insightful and compassionate guidance as beloved spiritual leader of the Kingsbridge Heights Jewish Center in the Bronx. As learned as he was wise, Dr. Miller was an alumnus of Yeshiva College, earned his master's degree from Columbia University, and was ordained at RIETS, where he taught practical rabbinics and influenced the careers and lives of countless students. In 1967, when he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree, then-University president Dr. Samuel Belkin called him ''the symbol of the ideal rabbi.'' He joined the University administration in 1968, was appointed vice president in 1970, senior vice president in 1979, and senior vice president emeritus in 1994. He was a member of the Board of Governors of YU's Wurzweiler School of Social Work and of the RIETS Board of Trustees. As he was fond of saying, ''I came as a freshman in 1934 and have never really left.'' We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Ruth; his children, Rabbi David (and Miriam) Miller, Rabbi Michael (and Phyllis) Miller, Deborah (and Norman) Kram, and Judith (and Jay) Kalish, his 19 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, his brother David and sister Dorothy who reside in Netanya, Israel, and all members of the bereaved family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. The loss of this remarkable man of wisdom, warmth, compassion and leadership leaves a void in the world.

us,Mr. Ray's Neighborhood,"Man Ray, born Emmanuel Radnitsky and raised by Russian Jewish parents in Brooklyn, arrived in Paris in 1921 to see originals of paintings he admired as an art student. ''Unfortunately when I got over here I got tied up with the avant-garde movement, which despised museums, which wanted to destroy them,'' he recalled. Before long, he found a mentor and collaborator in Marcel Duchamp and established himself as a fashion and portrait photographer. In MAN RAY'S MONTPARNASSE (Abrams, $29.95), Herbert R. Lottman provides a glimpse of the bohemian Parisian neighborhood as seen through the photographer's lens: Picasso in his studio, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in their salon, Marcel Proust on his deathbed, Peggy Guggenheim in couture. The book is also a homage to a place where an influx of artists exchanged ideas on art and revolution at the Coupole and La Dme. ''Montparnasse was really the first international colony of artists . . . superior to Montmartre, Greenwich Village or Chelsea,'' Duchamp wrote in his memoirs. Lottman, whose books include ''The Left Bank: Writers, Artists, and Politics From the Popular Front to the Cold War,'' clearly knows and adores his subject. Even though his premise that Man Ray's portraits link the creative circles in Montparnasse is contrived, ''Man Ray's Montparnasse'' is an enchanting introduction to these artists' lives.

After Mr. Langford defeated Mr. Whelan in an election in November and took office in January the city agreed on the $850,000. But Mr. Neafsey's complaint says the city's business administrator, Benjamin Fitzgerald, and the City Council should not have had the authority to settle, especially since Mr. Fitzgerald recommended the settlement after Mr. Langford appointed him to the job.

When backed by state power, it can lead to murder and mayhem, which is why our founding fathers insisted on the separation of church and state. People who disparage other faiths no longer come off as commendably pious, as they did centuries ago; now they just seem boorish. So naturally, when Los Angeles school officials discovered anti-Semitic commentary in an edition of the Koran donated to school libraries last fall by a local Islamic foundation, they pulled the books off the shelf. Then, to emphasize that they weren't discriminating against Islam or protecting the feelings of Jews only, they announced the formation of a committee to review the commentaries accompanying all religious texts in their collection. The idea is to get rid of ''any matter reflecting adversely on persons because of their race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex or occupation.''",2002-03-24T05:00:00+0000

But Fuller missed her two adult daughters and granddaughter, so the family decided to return north.

His wife, Johnie Walker Murphy, preceded him in death; surviving him are: four children; Michael Walker Murphy, Martha Wilson Murphy, Charles Haywood Murphy, III, and Robert Madison Murphy; three sisters, Theodosia Murphy Nolan, Caroline Murphy Winter, and Bertie Murphy Smith; and eight grandchildren. He was born in El Dorado March 6, 1920, the son of Charles Haywood Murphy, Sr. and Bertie Wilson Murphy. Charles Murphy is best remembered as an oilman. His father had him manumitted by court order at the age of sixteen so he could legally transact business for himself, and he entered the petroleum industry on his own as an independent while still in his teens. At the age of twenty-one he assumed full managerial responsibility for his family's business, consisting primarily of oil production, farming and timber lands scattered across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. For the next fifty-three years (except for three years' service in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II) he devoted his considerable energy to building this business into an international oil company that has been active on every continent except Antarctica. It is now a public company, of which the family still owns some 25%, and it still bears the family name, Murphy Oil Corporation. It is ranked by Fortune and Forbes magazines on some of their various measures as from the 312th to the 370th largest industrial concerns in the United States. Charles Murphy served this organization, under various titles, as its Chief Executive Officer until 1986 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1994. While building Murphy Oil, Charles Murphy did not forsake his heritage as a banker. He succeeded his father as a major shareholder and dominant force in the First National Bank of El Dorado, which later became part of a group of banks owned by First United Bancshares, which Charles Murphy served as Chairman of the Board. This group of banks has now been succeeded by BancorpSouth Banc. Additionally, Murphy was a major investor in First Commercial Corporation, a significant regional bank holding company, where he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. First Commercial has now become part of Regions Bank. Less public attention has been focused on Charles Murphy's career as an educator and philanthropist. This is the way he wanted it. He served seventeen years on the Arkansas Board of Higher Education, where he was instrumental in beginning the drive to improve the quality of public education in Arkansas. At the same time, he was dedicated to the improvement of private education as well, and gave generously of his time and money in this cause. He served ten years as a trustee of Hendrix College, where he and his family established the Hendrix Murphy Foundation, providing financial support to the institution. He also served on the Board of Administrators of Tulane University, where he and his family established the Tulane Murphy Foundation and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy. The Murphy Foundation, established by Charles Murphy, his wife, and his mother, provides financial support to both public and private institutions of learning, as well as scholarships to enable students to pursue higher education. For his service in the field of education, Murphy was recognized with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Arkansas in 1966. (continued next column)",2002-03-24T05:00:00+0000

Her career was built on guileless characters and sweet romances, so a very adult, somewhat cynical take on marriage seemed risky. The director, Stanley Donen, eventually talked her into taking the role and then promptly talked her out of being dressed by Givenchy, the French couturier she had always entrusted with concealing what she considered her figure flaws. Donen accompanied her on a shopping spree in London and Paris, where they bought most of her character's wardrobe off the peg from Mary Quant, Paco Rabanne and Michele Rosier, among other swinging 1960's emporiums. Although Hepburn allowed jeans and miniskirts on screen, she did hold to certain rules. Primary colors and busy patterns were to be avoided. Outfits were padded to fill out her upper body and altered to minimize her hips. Stockings and boots had to emphasize her slender calves. ''I want to stay in fashion, but being young in spirit counts more toward looking young than dressing in a hippie style,'' Hepburn told an interviewer.",2002-03-24T05:00:00+0000

With a gas station next door and a traffic light down the street, there are more pressing things to look at than a small restaurant with a simple green sign. But beyond the nondescript facade lies a taste of the Portuguese cooking made famous in Newark's Ironbound section. Churrasco, a k a barbecue, is the restaurant's raison d'tre. Even if you somehow forget the restaurant's name, you'll know this is a barbecue joint the second you walk in the door. The smoke tips you off, as do the whole chickens rotating on spits over the brick charcoal pit behind the counter. One smell and it's guaranteed that whatever else you order, you'll be trying some of that perfectly crisped chicken ($10 for a whole bird). Rotisserie-style pork ribs ($10) are the other house specialty. Like the chicken, the ribs are served plain, with no sauce or seasoning. ''We let the charcoal give them flavor,'' said the owner,the Portuguese-born Feliseerto Santos. For $7, the half-combo is a steal, with half a chicken, several ribs, and a choice of French fries and rice or boiled potatoes, cabbage and carrots. (The fries come in a mound so tall you'll wonder if there are any spuds left in Idaho.) More manageable for lunch is the steak sandwich ($5), smothered with cheese and fried onions and served with those great fries. There are a handful of tables, but given the smoky atmosphere it's best to order take-out. You'll probably want to anyway: this is messy eating and some things are better done in private.

Upon his return, he attended the School of Ceramic Design at Alfred University, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree. Moving to Bennington, David founded Bennington Potters, Inc. in 1948. His 54 year career began with a one-man operation and grew to include multiple stores, a restaurant, a mail-order business, a contract art production facility, and a ceramic factory. He spent his last five years building his successor operation. His loves were art, design and production. His satisfaction was problem solving, his greatest pleasure was seeing his own designs out in the world, both in the marketplace and in people's hands being used everyday. David's legacy is the Bennington Pottery Brand and his memory is an icon to craft producers; he was a man who made a business from his art. David's arrival at his studio inside the Pottery everyday from 1948 until last Saturday, was his daily adventure in practicing his craft. David was also devoted to his family and friends.

While we were talking, one of us dropped a dime on the floor. Schultz bent down to pick it up and offered it to me, since it wasn't clear which one of us had dropped it. ''You think I can be bribed so easily?'' I asked. Schultz blanched, and he took a full step back. In Schultz's world, money is obviously such a deep subtext that it can never be mentioned explicitly in public, even if it's only a joke, only a dime. A minute or two later, as if to recover, he stage-whispered to the Sonics' public-relations director to tell me about how Desmond Mason, a second-year player, was going to visit a terminally ill teenager that afternoon.",2002-03-24T05:00:00+0000

But New Yorkers may focus instead on the description of the brownstone. For starters, no one uses the term ''townstone,'' as the film does, for the house on West 94th Street employed in the movie. And how about claiming it is from 1879? ''Extraordinarily early for that section of town,'' said Christopher Gray, an architectural historian. More important, what's a mint 4,200-square-foot ''townstone'' on a park block, with an elevator, worth? About $3.5 million, said Elaine Flug, a sales agent at Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy. Adding a safe room doesn't add value. ''New Yorkers don't need safe rooms,'' she said, ''unless it's to store your jewelry and paintings when you're on vacation.'' LINDA LEE",2002-03-28T05:00:00+0000

The News Corporation owns 42.6 percent of Gemstar-TV Guide, which produces electronic television program guides and owns TV Guide magazine.

At least some of the reduction in data collection can be linked to the dot-com downturn, the report concluded, and a growing sense that data collection is not as lucrative a business as many companies had hoped. The report is similar to a series of surveys since 1998 that have helped to shape federal privacy policy. Marc Rotenberg, who heads the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, said the report is likely to be used by the Bush administration in support of its opposition to regulation, even though privacy fears among consumers have not abated and the issues are growing increasingly complex.

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: Dutch Ruling In Kazaa Case,"In a setback for the entertainment industry, a Dutch appeals court has overturned a lower court order that prohibited distribution of a popular program used to trade music and movies over the Internet. The appeals court ruled that the distributor of the program, Kazaa Media Desktop, is not liable for unauthorized copies of material made by people who use the software. The decision underscores the difficulty copyright holders face in trying to fight piracy by attacking the technology that makes it possible, particularly given the global reach of the Internet and the inconsistency of national copyright laws. The Dutch court decision contrasts with a United States appeals court ruling earlier this week that upheld an order against Napster, another file-trading service, which was found liable for contributing to copyright infringement. Music and film industry trade groups have accused the Australian company that distributes Kazaa, Sharman Networks, of violating United States copyright laws. The groups have sued Sharman and two other file-sharing software companies in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. That trial is expected to start in October.

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: Yahoo Alters Privacy Policy,"Yahoo changed its privacy policy yesterday to give it far more latitude to send e-mail or postal mail and make phone calls to sell its services and those of the companies it works with. Yahoo's policy had strictly prohibited the sale or rental of personally identifiable information. Customers could choose, by selecting an option, to receive marketing messages from other companies. Yesterday, Yahoo started sending an e-mail message to customers telling them that unless they changed options on its site, they would be agreeing to receive e-mail, phone calls and postal mail on behalf of Yahoo's services, including partners like stores that rent space in Yahoo's shopping channel. Yahoo's new policy gives it more latitude to disclose personal information, for example, in ''situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,'' it said. Yahoo also permits itself to transfer personal information if the company is bought. Saul Hansell (NYT)",2002-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Last week, Mr. Hewlett showed that he would not quit even if he lost; he filed a lawsuit accusing Hewlett-Packard of improperly obtaining votes. John C. Wilcox, vice chairman of Georgeson Shareholder Communications, which helped Hewlett-Packard enlist shareholder support, spoke last week about the nature of proxy contests.

The obvious choices are Spago in Hollywood, Nobu in Tribeca and Hennessy Tavern in Northvale. No, really. The Bergen County bar and restaurant is named after Jill Hennessy, star of the television show ''Crossing Jordan.'' Her husband, Paolo Mastropietro, opened the establishment in 1999, and even enlisted Benjamin Bratt to help hang drywall. More recently, the NBC comedy ''Ed'' has used the bowling alley two doors down as its primary set, and that program's cast and crew have become Hennessy regulars. This was not my motivation to visit. I am a man of the people, not easily entranced by the glitz and glamour of the Tinseltown elite. So I dropped by during a quieter time: Sunday brunch (served from 11 till 2). For $8.95, you can select two eggs with bacon or sausage, a three-egg omelet with three fillings, steak and eggs ($2 extra), eggs Benedict, buttermilk pancakes, French toast, grilled chicken or a burger and fries. Also included are coffee or tea, and a bloody Mary, mimosa or orange juice. The large dining room has a sort of ski lodge feel, with a fireplace, exposed-beam high ceiling and real wood paneling. I savored every bite of my ham, bacon and mozzarella omelet with home fries and toast. Okay, I admit it, I was lingering, hoping for a celebrity sighting. Somebody. Anybody. Abe Vigoda, even. But it was not to be. Still, brunch was a pleasant experience. I took a few snapshots of the ''Stuckey Bowl,'' and returned home to my normal life.

At Opia on East 57th Street, the elite can meet in a Moroccan-style hideaway just two steps above the main lounge. From the inside, it resembles a plush opium den; from the outside, it looks like a stage. At Discothque on West 19th Street in Chelsea, left, a room furnished with a large leather banquette has an opening shaped like an eye. And at Happy Ending, the massage-parlor-turned-lounge on Broome Street on the Lower East Side, two former saunas serve as V.I.P. nooks with sliding glass doors. ''People feel comfortable and protected in V.I.P. rooms,'' said Peter Sibilia, who designed Discothque. ''And the people on the outside have something to look up to.

In THE WATERCOURSE (Knopf, $23), her third poetry collection, Zarin deploys a rigorously simple vocabulary in the service of varied forms -- an eclogue here; a round there; even a psalm. The poet's tightly packed lines contain rhymes and descriptions of animals -- a hen, moths, a haughty parrot (''Stutterer, loiterer, his cage a Taj Mahal'') -- that may occasionally remind a reader of Elizabeth Bishop or W. H. Auden. (The latter's ''crepe-paper face'' is wittily invoked in ''Auden in the Aquarium.'') But Zarin, who has also written three airy, rhyme-inflected children's books, claims her own territory in numerous poems about her children -- about taking them to a neighborhood swimming pool, or watching one of their sleep-voyages (''Not longer than the crib is wide, / you berth at every latitude, / brown bear at your foot, birds / by your head, and along your length / beasts congregate: dolphin, / seal, man-manatee; kin / in the blood-heat sea / that buoys you up''). In ''The Swimming Pool,'' a pregnant Zarin pats her round tummy while thinking about the amniotic fluid that turns motherhood into its own watercourse for a baby: the poet becomes a body of water.

We mourn the passing of Ada Slawson, mother, grandmother, mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law, who died in Rhinebeck, New York, on March 30, 2002, at the age of 91, after a short illness. Her first ninety years were lived in her beloved New York City. She married John Slawson, then Director of the Jewish Board of Guardians, in 1937 and the following year graduated from the Columbia School of Social Work and joined the staff of the Jewish Child Care Association (JCCA) as a Case Worker in the Foster Home Department. By the time her husband became Executive Vice-President of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) in 1943, a position he held until 1967, she had stopped working full-time to raise a family, but never ceased her commitment to community welfare. In the 1950's, she was a national chairwoman of the Council of Jewish Women and also served on the JCCA Board of Directors. In 1961, she rejoined the staff of that organization in a parttime capacity, administering its psychiatric clinic from 1961 until 1974, when her husband's health began to deteriorate. Until his death in 1989, she balanced caring for her spouse with volunteering at the Museum of Natural History and participating in projects at the Women's City Club. In the last full decade of her life, she studied in seminars at the Lotos Club and helped out wherever she saw a need, whether in feeding boarder babies at New York Hospital or tutoring a blind social work student.

Fortunately, the couple did not take the school at its word. Testing by a learning specialist revealed that the child was brighter than most.

The problem is that fewer than a quarter of America's teachers know how to teach reading to children who do not get it automatically.
