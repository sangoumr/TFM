Some facts (some big ones) from Sackss essay, The Last Hippie, seem to have been altered and molded into a workable movie narrative, naturally, and I worry that Sackss poignantly honest account will have received a Hollywood face-lift. But maybe the film will surprise us, as did the melancholy but still-hopeful ending to Awakenings.",2011-03-02T20:45:56+0000

Adeles new album, 21 (XL/Columbia), opened with 352,000 sales, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Thanks to a blitz of television appearances to promote the album, that was the best opening-week sales of any album in three months. (In the interim, there have been some painfully low numbers.) And her debut album, 19, bolted 34 spots to No. 16, with 18,000 sales. But almost everything else on the chart is a loser. Last weeks No. 1, Justin Biebers Never Say Never: The Remixes (Island), fell to No. 2 with 102,000, a 38 percent decline, and Mr. Biebers My World 2.0, at No. 5, lost 22 percent. Mumford & Sons Sigh No More (Glassnote), at No. 3, dropped 46 percent; Now Thats What I Call Music! Vol. 37 is No. 4 with a 38 percent loss; Bruno Marss Doo-Wops & Hooligans (Elektra), at No. 6, lost 40 percent, and so on. Last weeks numbers were higher than usual because of the traditional retail boost the week after the Grammys. But that only underlines the scale of Adeles success. On the digital singles chart, Lady Gagas Born This Way, which was enormously popular out of the gate, lost 44 percent of its sales in its third week, with 286,000, although that was enough for it to hold at No. 1.",2011-03-02T22:22:43+0000

There are still a handful of Pacific Islanders who can navigate based on the precise position and distance of the stars above the horizon and on their knowledge of tides and currents. In many Muslim countries, it is commonplace for children no older than 10 or 12 to have memorized the entire Koran. Such feats of memorization are also common among Orthodox religious students and among Hindus who memorize chanted prayers and scriptures. Religion was once the major institution for passing on vital cultural knowledge. We are no longer lonely bands of hunter-gather warriors, so this vast amount of informationis no longer necessary.

The city begged the public-employee unions for pay cuts  all to no avail. In May 2008, Vallejo filed for bankruptcy. The filing drew little national attention; most people were too busy watching banks fail to worry about cities. But while the banks have largely recovered, Vallejo is still in bankruptcy.

Let us not remind New York what all the avid and demanding among us take for granted, that a volume of three novellas is more intriguing than one flabby novel. Let us downplay the novella in casual conversation. Writers, if you have a cant-miss commercially viable yarn a-brewing, be good enough to stretch it into a short novel or compress it into a long story. And look, lets keep the novella for ourselves, the adults. We deserve something, dont we? Lets free the novella of prizes and awards and citations and all manner of gold star.

Rango (Paramount Pictures), left, an animated entry featuring the voice of Johnny Depp, was No. 1 in North America with about $38 million in ticket sales. The Adjustment Bureau (Universal Pictures) was second with an estimated $20.9 million, a good result for a difficult-to-market science-fiction thriller cum romance. Even the struggling CBS Films, exhibiting greatly improved marketing, had a decent weekend with its inexpensive Beastly, which sold about $10.1 million for third place. So was Hollywood in a glum mood? Moviegoers spent a total of $135 million on tickets over the weekend, a 31 percent decline from the same period a year ago, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. So far this year ticket revenue is down 20 percent on a 22 percent decline in attendance. The problem is that while films have been doing fine, there has been no blockbuster of the kind that can lift interest in moviegoing across the board. (Last year it was Alice in Wonderland.) Rounding out the top five were two holdovers; Hall Pass (Warner Brothers) sold about $9 million in tickets for a two-week total of $27 million, and Gnomeo & Juliet (Walt Disney) sold about $6.9 million for a four-week total of $83.7 million.",2011-03-06T22:25:10+0000

No one else is doing this, Mark Adamo, the director of professional development for American Lyric, said in a statement. Aspiring librettists can study music-theater writing on the graduate level, but their work will draw overwhelmingly from the commercial and nonprofit theater, leaving unexamined the substantial differences that remain between the theater and the opera house.

No poet has more passionately and thoroughly spoken for his people than Neruda, Mr. Rader wrote, citing Canto General, a 15-part book comprising over 200 poems and 15,000 lines tracing the history of Latin America. It is an insanely ambitious project that seemed to unify a country. In second place was Shakespeare, whose name, according to Mr. Raders shockingly unscientific measurements, appeared most frequently in reader e-mails, followed by Dante, who Mr. Rader said was the most controversial pick, because hes only well known for one poem (The Divine Comedy). Western literary greats like Walt Whitman, John Donne, Emily Dickinson, William Butler Yeats and Wallace Stevens also appear on the list with the Eastern favorites Rumi and Li Po, whom Mr. Rader called the great poet of drunkenness.",2011-03-06T22:28:36+0000

They were joined (with caveats) by an increasingly assertive Senator John Kerry, who insisted that a no-fly zone did not necessitate a military attack per se, contradicting Defense Secretary Gatess statement on March 2. The question of American policy on intervention in Libya has been murky; Hillary Clinton seemed a bit more hawkish than the president for a while, as did Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. Obama has been getting real results on Libya at the United Nations  in the Security Council, at the General Assembly and even in Geneva at the Human Rights Council. But in American politics, successes at the U.N. are not to be spoken of. Americans may have lost their taste for unilateral actions, but they havent gained one for multilateral actions either.Then how about some Special Forces sneaking about, as a sop to pride or at least an outlet for the national sense of adventure? Britains experience last week suggests caution is in order. A report in The Guardian this morning says a fellow named only Tom, whom the paper believes to be a British intelligence agent, had been working at the Al-Khadra Farm Company  which raises wheat southwest of Benghazi, Libya  for five months, until last Thursday, when he drove off into the desert at 3 a.m. with another foreign national, later returning with large bags and six armed Special Air Service men. Guards at the farm arrested them. That must have had a wilting effect on the S.A.S. mens spirits. But farm personnel gave them a good hot breakfast and packed them off, and by Sunday the little band was safely away to Malta. ",2011-03-07T21:03:54+0000

Imrie quit college to assist Bruce Weber, went on to work on a horse farm in Montauk, N.Y., then movedto Amish country, where he salvaged crumbling barns. He spent a year studying the New Testament (in Greek). Then he biked from Los Angeles, his current home base, to Brazil.

The results in St. Louis were even more unusual: Lincoln edged out Douglas in a four-way race that  unlike any other that day  mirrored the returns of the country as a whole. St. Louis became the only large city in a slave state won by the president-elect, defying regional stereotypes. And Missouri stayed true to form on March 9, 1861, when its secession convention became the first such meeting to vote for staying in the Union. ",2011-03-09T02:30:41+0000

Women are not allowed to enter movie theaters or concert halls or often even to be outdoors without head scarves, the Human Rights Watch report said. Tanya Lokshina, a Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch and the reports author, said at a news conference in Moscow that the Chechen women shot with paintballs last summer for failing to follow the dress code were too frightened to file formal complaints.

A collaborative track with the goth-y Chicago/Michigan trio Salem in late 2010 demonstrated refreshing cross-genre (or subgenre) knowledge. Without being politically correct, Lil B is adept at playing clever word games to undermine some of the negative tropes inherent to hip-hop; his trademark boast  the constantly recycled lyric Im a pretty bitch  uses egotism to unravel misogyny.

It also prompts one Mike to ask the other Mike on Mike and Mike in the Morning, on ESPN Radio, if its even possible for a football player like Barber to succeed in coming back if his primary motivation is money and not a raging love for the game. Mike (the former football-playing one) expresses doubt, says it would be hard.

Even cooler is this installation connected to another G.O.A.T. candidate, the F1 racer Michael Schumacher.

Mr. Wickliffe was killed in 2007 on the set of The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolans sequel to his superhero film Batman Begins, as he rode in a pickup truck driving parallel to a stunt car; the pickup missed a 90-degree turn and crashed into a tree. Last week, prosecutors argued that Mr. Corbould, who won an Oscar for his work on Inception and whose filmography includes several James Bond movies, did not follow proper safety guidelines in planning the stunt and that the accident was foreseeable.

us,Get Real and Get a Mandoline,"A mandoline seems to be one of the last frontiers for the home cook. Maybe it seems too fussy with all those different blades, or maybe people are under the impression that you have to buy the most expensive model, which can get extremely pricey. But even the cheapest mandoline will make your life so much easier in the kitchen.For example, while I could, with much time and a little effort, thinly slice the potatoes for a gratin (such as in my column on Wednesday), running them through a mandoline takes about three minutes and gives me perfectly even, gossamer slices, which melt into the cream while baking in the oven. I also rely on my mandoline for paper-thin slices of fennel and zucchini for salads, and lovely wafers of beets that I serve carpaccio-style with a walnut-mustard dressing on top. And then theres my recipe for French apple tart, which depends on uniform slices of apple that are a breeze with a mandoline.So here are a few tips for those of you ready to take the plunge.Mandolines range in price based on the sharpness of the blade, the number of different cuts the blades will make and the sturdiness of the base. I have used the Super Benriner (about $50), but years ago, I had the most basic Benriner ($20) and it served me just fine until the blades grew dull. If you just want something basic, go for a cheaper model  they start somewhere around $15 (Norpro and Kyocera, for example, make them). And if you want something a bit more substantial (able to handle a more diverse range of fruits and vegetables), go for a sturdier, more advanced model. Oxo and Swissmar Borner (both about $40) are two reliable brands in this price range.And if you are looking to invest in something that will last you a lifetime and give you the widest variety of blades for different cuts, stainless steel professional models go for around $100, but you probably wont ever have to replace them. Mandolines from MIU sell for about $110; Bron has one for $150 and De Buyers model, $229, allows for left-handed users.Most of the mandolines are compact and collapsible, which is particularly useful if youre in a tiny kitchen and space is at a premium. And if youre worried about cuts and scrapes, consider this glove, which has saved my knuckles from many an injury.",2011-03-16T18:17:13+0000

The play, Imagining Madoff by Deborah Margolin, originally depicted a close relationship between Mr. Madoff and Mr. Wiesel, who in real life lost all his and his wifes savings and $15.2 million of his charitable foundations assets in Mr. Madoffs Ponzi scheme. Before the plays premiere at Theater J in Washington, Ms. Margolin sent Mr. Wiesel a copy of the script, hoping he would like it. Instead, he threatened to have his lawyer halt the production. Ms. Margolin agreed to revise the play, but when Theater Js artistic director, Ari Roth, volunteered to show the revised script to Mr. Wiesels foundation, she decided to back out of the production entirely. Instead, she took the rewritten version  with Mr. Wiesels character replaced by a fictional Holocaust survivor and poet named Solomon Galkin  to Stageworks/Hudson, a small theater company in upstate New York, where it was performed last summer. Mr. Roth saw the play there and subsequently renewed a discussion with Ms. Margolin about producing it at Theater J. The play will open on Aug. 31 and run through Sept. 25.",2011-03-16T20:15:18+0000

Ms. Angle shook up her party and her state last year when she won the Republican primary and faced off with Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, in a race she lost by several points.

us,Seeing Things | Handmade for Japan,"It has been almost one week since the devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. If, like me, you love design, you probably have a favorite Japanese designer in fashion, architecture, graphic design or ceramics. Japan is a country that has always nurtured design, from handcraft to industrially produced goods; as a result, good design has become synonymous with Japanese design. Many of the countrys designers have been affected by the disaster, which continues to unfold in ways that are unfathomable to most of us. In Kasama and Mashiko, centers of ceramic production that are about halfway between Tokyo and Sendai, potters were hard hit by the quake when brick kilns collapsed and years worth of production shattered in minutes. Moved by the desire to support their fellow artists, three enterprising women in the United States have organized Handmade for Japan, an online auction of handmade work donated by Japanese artists and American artists with ties to Japan. Ayumi Horie, a Japanese-American potter who lives in Hudson, N.Y., recruited her friends Kathryn Pombriant Manzella and Ai Kanazawa Cheung to solicit donations and set up the auction, while the illustrator David Gordon designed a logo overnight. Offers of support, in-kind donations and handmade goods have poured in via Twitter, Facebook and e-mail. And artists including the illustrator Lisa Congdon, the textile designer Kaoru Oka and the ceramists Jun Kaneko, Justin Rothshank, Kathy Erteman and Diana Fayt, to name a few, have contributed paintings, shawls and, of course, pottery. The auction will go live on eBay on March 24 and will run through March 27. Through GlobalGiving, 100 percent of the auction proceeds will support relief efforts in Japan.

Born This Way, whose chorus proclaims Im beautiful in my way / Cause God makes no mistakes, would already seem a tough fit in Malaysia, where last year the singer Adam Lambert had a concert protested by the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party, which said his shows promote gay culture. And while radio stations there are playing the song, they have been garbling a lyric that says, No matter gay, straight or bi, lesbian, transgendered life, Im on the right track, baby, for fear that it violates Malaysian indecency laws. The Malaysian broadcaster AMP Radio Networks told The A.P. that those lyrics may be considered as offensive when viewed against Malaysias social and religious observances, adding that being gay or bisexual is still considered as a taboo by general Malaysians.",2011-03-17T13:53:02+0000

Opening April 16, this striking museum  designed by David Chipperfield and named for the painter J. M. W. Turner, one of Margates famous visitors  has already spurred new galleries, pubs and cafes, as well as the restoration of Dreamland, a 1920s amusement park down the road. And it has inspired a lyrical new work by Tracey Emin, who grew up in Margate. Her pink neon sculpture I Never Stopped Loving You hangs adjacent to the museum. (Hundreds of people showed up to cheer its installation last year.) There is more of an appetite for contemporary art here than you might imagine, says Victoria Pomery, the Turners founding director. The inaugural show presents six artists whose works relate to a little-known Turner canvas depicting the Soufrire volcano on St. Vincent. We want to help audiences get a better sense of the contemporary through the historical, Pomery says. And we will always have a Turner presence.

Then there is the Irish writer John Banvilles elegant roman  clef, The Untouchable, which explored Blunts life. And novelists of such varying stripes as Ian Fleming and John le Carr have drawn sustenance from the treachery that emanated from 1930s Cambridge, where enlistment in the workers revolution seems to have easily accompanied sipping claret, participating in debauches and collecting Poussin paintings.

We know what it is, but we dont know why it exerts such a powerful hold on the imagination, or how it works its magic. Theres a perfect madness in the desire to study moonlight, to wander across the world under its spell, to seek out the ways in which it alters reality, inspires art or otherwise leaves its mark on the soul. But thats just the sort of intellectual wanderlust that seized James Attlee one evening during a walk on the coast of Cornwall as he watched the rim of the harvest moon emerging from the sea, a monstrous, swollen apparition. Struck by this spectacular sight, Attlee was also struck by the realization that our lives are no longer held, as they were for countless millennia, in the sway of the night sky.

It is perfectly true, however, that both uptown and downtown, writers drank, womanized and had misogynistic attitudes.

Gold embraces a gemstone and assumes its form, says von Furstenberg of eye-catching pieces like the undulating teardrop crystal rings. The movement within the gold alludes to sensuality and natural feminine forms. Inspirational inscriptions, like love, laughter, harmony and freedom, are engraved on the back of each pendant, earring droplet and ring, a tribute to the power von Furstenberg sees in both words and gold. (Prices range from $3,200 to $8,200). The combination not only adds beauty, but strength and empowerment as well, she explains.

(There were hints of a similar critique from Adam Serwer and Andrew Sullivan as well.) This was not my intention at all: As Ive suggested before, I think that the Iraq War was a mistake in its conception and a botch in its execution, and I wouldnt be supportive of our Libya intervention if it were being undertaken la Rumsfeld (or John Bolton) rather than la Samantha Power. My point, rather, was to push back against the conceit that the form of a war can vindicate its strategy  that what matters most in warfare is whether youre part of U.N. Security Council approved action and whether the Arab League gives you the go-ahead, and that merely invoking the Obama White Houses multilateralism is sufficient to prove that our Libyan venture is far more responsible than the invasion of Iraq. Too many liberal Libya hawks (the president included) seem bent on persuading themselves that a strategically dubious intervention is justified so long as its goals are sufficiently high-minded and the French and the United Nations are on board. But the history of such interventions doesnt bear their logic out.",2011-03-22T16:28:16+0000

The film, which won Oscars for best picture, director (Tom Hooper) and original screenplay (David Seidler) as well as for Mr. Firths performance, was originally released with an R rating. The Weinstein Company did not immediately explain what changes it was making to the PG-13 cut, but presumably some un-regal language will be toned down. ",2011-03-24T16:21:20+0000

The lower court, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, said the issues involved were so fundamental  involving a clash between the states open meetings law and the separation of legislative and judicial powers  that it made sense to send the case straight to states highest court. Last Friday, a judge in Dane County blocked the law while she considered a lawsuit that accuses Republican lawmakers of violating open meetings laws by failing to give adequate notice of the vote on the union law. The state had asked the appeals court to throw out that order. Also Thursday, an Indiana prosecutor said one of his deputies had resigned after admitting that he sent an e-mail to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin suggesting that Mr. Walker fake an attack on himself to discredit the unions. The prosecutor, Brad Cooper of Johnson County, said the deputy, Carlos Lam, acknowledged that he sent an e-mail, which was obtained by The Associated Press. It said: If you could employ an associate who pretends to be sympathetic to the unions cause to physically attack you (or even use a firearm against you), you could discredit the public unions.

In 1666, an unstoppable fire burned the city to the ground; the bells of St. Pauls melted.

His 1996 memoir, Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa, was an affecting account of his coming-of-age in white-minority-ruled Rhodesia, where his father managed a factory and his mother, a physician, operated a rural health clinic. The story climaxed with the outbreak of the civil war that would bring the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe to power  and with the accidental killing of Godwins elder sister by Rhodesian troops at a roadblock. When a Crocodile Eats the Sun: A Memoir of Africa, published in 2007, picked up the narrative with Mugabes evolution into a brutal dictator who stomped on the opposition, evicted thousands of white farmers in a violent land reform program and plunged his country into ruin. Now Godwin has written the third installment of what might be called his Zimbabwe trilogy.

The new script beefs up the role of another villain, the Green Goblin (right, played by Patrick Page, battling Reeve Carney as Peter Parker/Spider-Man), who proved popular with focus groups that the producers convened after the onslaught of negative reviews by theater critics. Most of the changes will be implemented during the shows hiatus, which starts April 19, according to the two production members, who would only speak anonymously because the producers do not want the changes discussed publicly. On Thursday, the producers said that the choreographer Chase Brock would stage new musical numbers. Mr. Brock, 27, is best known for his choreography on a popular video game, the Broadway Experience. He takes over from Daniel Ezralow. The producers ousted Ms. Taymor this month; Mr. Ezralow said at the time that he was directly assured that he would continue with the show.

The report indicated that government corruption continued to be a major concern among Chinese, and that some in the central government realize the ubiquitous image of corrupt officialdom is eroding the confidence of Chinese people. Xinhua, citing a meeting on Wednesday of the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, said that the central government would report the final budget for those expenses to the National Peoples Congress, a rubber-stamp legislature, and make the accounting available for public scrutiny. Xinhua cited one official saying a crackdown on extravagant spending had saved the nation nearly $900 million last year. It is unclear whether such crackdowns have really had any significant impact on corruption and waste. ",2011-03-26T00:45:36+0000

Mr. Caperton, 71, a former Democratic governor of West Virginia, has led the College Board since 1999. A search for his successor is expected to begin soon, the board said. Mr. Caperton has presided over a period of enormous growth at the College Board, as the number of students who took one of its exams or its courses grew to over 7 million last year, compared with 3 million in 1999, the organization said. Among his accomplishments, the board said, was tripling the number of low-income students who took at least one Advanced Placement course. In that time, though, the SAT has lost ground to its chief rival, the ACT, a college entrance exam that tends to measure more of what students learn in the classroom than the SAT, which can be more of a yardstick of analytical skills.

Rodrick, with Zachary Gordon and Laine MacNeil, above, is the second in the Wimpy Kid series. It was produced for about $21 million and sold an estimated $24.4 million in tickets at North American theaters over the weekend, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. Sucker Punch, directed by Zack Snyder and partly financed by Legendary Pictures, was second with about $19 million. A forceful marketing campaign could not overcome abysmal reviews and a lack of interest (aside from young men) for the story line, in which a group of scantily clad, gun-toting women try to escape from an insane asylum. Limitless (Relativity Media) was third in its second week with about $15.2 million for a new total of $41.3 million. The Lincoln Lawyer (Lionsgate) was fourth, selling $11 million for a two-week total of about $30 million.

They estimated the chance at 20 percent. Whether thats true (I think 20 is too high, and if so, that would mean he was playing badly enough to get sent down, which means getting sent down would hardly make things worse), the argument boils down to this: Stanton is a bad pick in the fourth round of a 14-team mixed league because his non-injury-related floor is too low.

In 2009 the City Council, citing high rates of graffiti, voted to begin slowly phasing out the gates in favor of rolling grilles. But for at least a couple of months this summer, roll gates and paint will have a last hurrah together, courtesy of the New Museum and the Art Production Fund. As part of the Festival of Ideas for the New City  a series of arts and civic events that the New Museum and other downtown cultural institutions will conduct from May 4 through 8  17 artists have been recruited to create paintings that will soon start appearing on roll-down gates along the Bowery, from Houston Street to Canal Street. The artists  among them Mary Heilmann, Glenn Ligon and Ingrid Calame  have created the images but will hand off the actual painting chores to Colossal Media, a Brooklyn-based company. It removes itself from the practice of real graffiti, but it plays with the idea, said Yvonne Force Villareal, a co-founder of the Art Production Fund. She said that she and others involved with the project, to be called After Hours: Murals on the Bowery, first combed the Bowery at night, then spent months talking to property owners. Next comes power washing and, within the next several weeks, she said, the murals will start to appear for anyone interested in nocturnal Bowery art appreciation.

It was, in Le Corbusiers utopian terms, a machine for resting in, and as if to remind us that its the chair, not the woman, being presented for our consideration, her face is turned away; she is at once familiar and unrecognizable. That the design of their now-famous furniture was for many years attributed to Le Corbusier alone, that most of her architectural projects never made it past the drawing board, that her far-ranging commissions defied easy classification, that her most significant projects are either gone or off the beaten path: all this only contributed to the enigma.

us,Need a Broad? Call Turner,"IN Matthew Lombardos play High, Kathleen Turner plays a nun, of all people. This is the same actress whose character in Body Heat had a thermostat set so high she melted the brains and willpower of any man who got too close; who was a contract killer in Prizzis Honor and a prostitute in Crimes of Passion; and who in her previous Broadway appearance, in 2005, played a notably blowsy and vicious Martha in an acclaimed revival of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Before that, in 2002, she was the main reason for seeing the ill-conceived Broadway version of The Graduate, because in one scene she wore only a pair of high heels.",2011-03-31T23:43:35+0000
