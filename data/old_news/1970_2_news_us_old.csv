Clive Barnes: Mr. Bromberg's triple bill is a series of en counters, one comic, one pathetic and one tragic. They add up to an over heated, overhysterical yet finally rewarding evening. And probably the rewards derive as much from the acting of Ron Leibman and the direction of Herman Shumlin as from Mr. Brom berg's sensitive yet undis ciplined writing. By far the best part of the evening is a most remarkable mono logue  getting on to an hourby Mr. Leibman as a frayed, beaten psychia trist. Called Dr. Galley, this is an encounter be tween a psychiatrist and a university class. The char acter of the psychiatrist is wildly selfindulgent, and, fundamentally, quite unbe lievable. So for that matter is Mr. Bromberg's writing. Yet the power of Mr. Leib man's playing carries a be lief against all previous conviction. For Walter Kerr, see Page 7. CRISSCROSSING  WATER COLOR, the Playwrights Unit's production of two plays by Philip Magdalany got one favorable, two mixed and eight negative reviews.

us,"'Fando and Lis,' a Film Calculated to Shock","""EVERY cinematographic trick was avoided. The actors, enduring a veritable 'Via Crucis,' were stripped naked, tortured and beaten. Artificial blood was never used."" So conclude the clues for critics attractively printed and furnished by Panic Productions to accompany Alexandro Jodorowsky's film version of Fernando Arrabal's play, ""Fando and Lis,"" which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.It's a good thing movies are for one time only, because ""Fando and Lis"" subjects its heroes to vampirism at several levels of refinement. It also has Fando murder Lis (no retakes on that one), and at her funeral it exposes her body to be devoured in bite-sized portions by her mourners.But such is the anesthetic effect of Jodorowsky's direction (and perhaps of Arrabal's dramaturgy) that each new outrage invites a yawn; each torture, beating and nonartificial blood letting, an acknowledgment of shocking intention  and little more.He is impotent and she is paralytic, and together, through trash heap and desert, they search for an unattainable city called Tar. Along the way (which, of course, leads back to where they started) they have many meaningful experiences and encounter numerous exemplary grotesque characters.Repeatedly Fando is misled into strange adventures, and repeatedly he returns to serve and humiliate Lis. Occasionally they remember their childhoods in flashback, and near the end Fando's dying mother reappears and his dead father jumps out of the grave to claim him.Such figures of the imaginationparticularly the imaginations of Hieronymus Bosch, Gustave Dor, and above all, Federico Fellinigive a comfortable familiarity, a strong sense of having seen it all before, to the innovative excesses of ""Fando and Lis."" And Jodorowsky, in everything from his selection of freaks to his choice of camera angles, admits his indebtedness.It is as if the grotesque of the later Fellini, mostly drained of their (nonartificial) blood, has wandered zombie-like onto a landscape created by a marriage of low budget with literary sources, to take part yet again in the most approved rituals of academic absurdist tradition.Deprived of responsibility to objective reality, ""Fando and Lis"" tends to exploit accounts of subjective realitymost obviously, a simplistic Freudian system of guilt and repression. In spite of its fantastic premises, it seems almost wholly conventional in the interpretation it asks for its images. And like most overt film fantasy, the end product is flat, literal, unimaginative.Neither Sergio Klainer as Fando nor Diana Mariscal as Lis are acceptable actors (whether they could be if they had the chance is another question), and Miss Mariscal's Giulietta Masina make-up (another tribute to Fellini) works to reduce her part from performance to mere representation. For all its invocations of theater of cruelty, ""Fando and Lis"" hardly ever scares up anything stronger than unpleasant whimsey.",1970-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Elusive Reality:'A Married Couple,' by Allan King, Opens","BILLY EDWARDS is a 42-year-old advertising executive with a receding hairline, walrus mustache and a comparatively well-preserved, tubular-shaped physique of which he is proud. His wife, Antoinette, 30, is a former secretary to Shelley Winters. She has the kind of trim, well-packed figure that tends to look too plump in clothes, a face that becomes suddenly beautiful when she smiles, and, apparently, she doesn't shave under her arms.Billy and Antoinette live in a casually decorated (inflatable furniture, highly polished floors, multicolored kitchen, hi-fi, Pop posters), two-story frame house in Toronto with their 3-year-old son, Bogart, and a dog named Merton.They are real people, and they are the stars of a new cinma vrit film by Allan King (""Warrendale,"" ""Will the Real Norman Mailer Please Stand Up?"") that King calls ""A Married Couple,"" although an equally fitting title might be: ""Where Should We Put the Harpsichord?""For 10 weeks King and his crew (Richard Leiterman, the cameraman, and Christian Wangler, the soundman) more or less lived with the Edwardses from early morning until late at night, becoming silent participants in their lives, a constant audience, while photographing and recording them as they laughed, argued, were tender and exhibitionistic.In the course of the production, Billy and Antoinette came close to separating, which gives structure to the 97-minute film that King and his editor, Arla Saare, have put together from some 70 hours of original footage.The 40-year-old King is one of the most talented of the filmmakers now exploring the possibilities of documentary cinema, but it seems to me that in ""A Married Couple"" (which he calls ""actuality drama"" or ""living drama"") he has pushed filmed sociology into the murky outer reaches of psychodrama. In terms of straight, cinematic art, ""A Married Couple"" ranks somewhere above ""King, Murray"" but somewhere below such real movies as ""Birth of a Nation"" or even ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.""On film, anyway, Billy and Antoinette are not very interesting people (nor, I suspect, would most of the rest of us be, if photographed under similar circumstances). They are the sort of aware, upper middle income types who talk a lot about ""relatiohships"" and argue mostly about possessions  shoes, stereos, harpsichords, records, vacuum cleaners, the car.After six years of marriage, the point of all the arguments really is: Who is going to dominate whom? ""I'm completely bewildered,"" Billy says toward the end of the film. ""It seems that everytime we get on some plateau of understanding, the next minute we are kicking and screaming.""Throughout ""A Married Couple,"" which opened yesterday at the Kips Bay, it's perfectly apparent that Billy and Antoinette are playing to the camera, in moments of anger, intimacy and even boredom. It may be no accident that both of them were, at earlier stages in their lives, aspiring actors who never made it. The unreality prompted by the camera's presence is acknowledged in the film, which then proceeds to pass off this conscious performance as some kind of meta-truth that is neither fact nor fiction.What King ultimately proves, I think, is that something that is neither fact nor fiction is less meta-truth than sophisticated sideshow. As I've never believed there is a novel in everybody, nor even a tape-recorded book, I now am convinced there are probably very few people worthy of being the subjects of an actuality drama. Better than any other instrument, perhaps, the documentary camera can capture the sense and feeling of events, of social climates, and even of people in public crisis, but meaningful private drama must always elude it since the camera is stopped by what Arthur Miller once called ""the wall of the skin.""Anyone who saw King's ""Warrendale,"" a laconic, deeply moving study of the treament of emotionally disturbed children, will not be surprised by the great technical skill of ""A Married Couple,"" only by its built-in superficiality.Anyone, that is, except Billy and Antoinette Edwards. According to word from Toronto, the Edwardses, after watching all 70 hours of rough footage, patched up their differences, had a second child, and now are living happily ever after as celebrities of a sort. If you have a friend who is a filmmaker, a 16-mm. feature film might turn out to be less expensive than analysis.",1970-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Looking Glass War,' a Le Carre Spy Story","ESPIONAGE is a devious enough business without a studied, elliptical and sketchy screen treatment rendering it even more so and a spy protagonist who sticks out like a lighthouse. Such is the case with Columbia's ""The Looking Glass War,"" which arrived yesterday at Loew's State and the Orpheum Theaters.The color picture is generally as odd, mannered and unconvincing as young Christopher Jones, flanked by a predominantly British cast in the European-made drama derived from another cat-and-mouse thriller by John Le Carr.The opening portion, with the clipped accents and some furtively cryptic vignettes, obliquely indicates that British Intelligence needs photographs of a new rocket from East Berlin. This eventually becomes clear enough, as Ralph Richardson, Paul Rogers and Anthony Hopkins (fine actors, all) stalk, then initiate their derelict recruit, young Jones.And it takes a full hour, about half of the picture, under the obtusely staccato direction of the scenarist, Frank R. Pierson, with some footnoted domestic scenes of the strategists and a hovering concern for their mission recruit, apparently a symbol of new-generation independence.At any rate, the new spy sneaks under barbed wire (killing a guard, in the film's one solidly moving moment) and thereupon slouches across enemy territory with bland indifference, toting a large rucksack (complete with wireless), wearing dark glasses, staring morosely and finally entering a tender but conventional liaison with lovely Pia Degermark (""Elvira Madigan"").A climactic outburst indignantly suggests young Jones, whose all-American mumble is coated with a Polish accent, as a typical sacrifice of cold war machinations. Could be.The real question is this: Why would Jones, or anybody, have to risk his neck to photograph a rocket loudly trundled through the city streets as obviously as a transported whale? Back home, why didn't they simply watch it on television?",1970-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'Start the Revolution Without Me' Bows,"""START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East, is a comedy of errors about two sets of identical twins, mismatched at birth, who meet 30 years later on the eve of the French Revolution. The characters include people with real names (Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI), and people with funny names (Duke d'Escargot, Count Henri Mancini, Marie Montage) and lovable old Orson Welles, who appears as himself in the role of host-narrator.The film was directed by Bud Yorkin with a cast of British (Donald Sutherland, Hugh Griffith, Billie Whitelaw), American (Gene Wilder) and Swedish (Ewa Aulin) actors, mostly on actual French locations (the Chateau de Rochefort, Notre Dame). Period farce is not the easiest of movie genres under any circumstanstances, and the beautiful settings in ""Start the Revolution Without Me"" seem to have had an inhibiting effect on everything from comic inspiration to camera movements.I couldn't care less that 20th century automobiles can sometimes be seen in the background of scenes shot outside Notre Dame, but I do care that the mad chases in and around Rochefort seem choreographed largely to avoid breaking objects d'art and denting the architecture.The performances are desperate, without being in any way memorable, thus matching the wit of the screenplay. ""Do you know who I am?"" asks the imperious Duke De Sisi. ""The scrounge of Corsica?"" answers the peasant. ""That's scourge,"" says the Duke.",1970-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Two of their more recalcitrant victims were murdered, and a third died as a result of an overdose of sleeping pills administered by Mrs. Beck.The movie follows the killers from just before their meeting (through a lonely hearts club correspondence) until just before their trial. Although it takes only the slightest (and most essential) liberties with the facts of the Beck-Fernandez case, ""The Honeymoon Killers"" is basically a fiction filmof a type virtually unknown in recent years, except as transmuted in the myth-making romanticism of, say, a ""Bonnie and Clyde."" Within the limits of its type it is one of the best and, curiously, most beautiful American movies in recent years.Photographed in black and white, with fairly rudimentary sound recording and with lighting that seems always to come from natural sources or from whatever electric light bulbs might be at hand, ""The Honeymoon Killers"" virtually epitomizes the low-budget murder melodrama of everyone's fondest imaginations.In fact, it is concerned with murder less as crime than as unambiguous event. There is no conflict between law and disorder, no trail of clues, no hot pursuit, not even much suspense. When Martha decides that Raymond has taken more than monetary interest in one too many of their victims, she calls the police and turns him, and herself, in. And that, without climax, is the end of that.But ""The Honeymoon Killers"" has something else  a more concentrated, less cluttered, clearer vision than you are likely to have found in even the best conventional crime movies. Unusually seedy in all its particulars, utterly unflattering to all its characters, sufficiently horrible (but never gratuitously shocking) in the details of its murders, Kastle's film succeeds as a kind of chamber drama of desperate attraction and violent death.Although it is profoundly involved with the quality of individual middle-class American lives, it completely subordinates anecdote to action and pathos, even the pathos of its central characters, to passion.The secondary performances range from acceptable to excellent, with special praise for Mary Jane Higby as a 66-year-old Albany widow who proves especially difficult to kill. Shirley Stoler certainly looks the part of Martha Beck, but she brings to the role an air of grand disdain that seems reasonable as interpretation but sometimes awkward in performance. But Tony LoBianco, with slightly too much profile and a characterization that suggests an immensely humanized early Bela Lugosi, is brilliant.The real star of the movie is its writer-director. Leonard Kastle is a 40-year-old composer who has not previously made films. Oddly, the musical backgroundselections from Mahler symphonies, which oversell every climaxis the only serious failure in ""The Honeymoon Killers."" But direction, the sum of those decisions that the filmmaker must feel as moral imperatives and that constitute the authorship of a movie, places Kastle among the important deliberate artists of his medium.",1970-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Furthermoreand for once on the screentranscribers is spelled out in the whole team of the closing credits, from Paulette Rubinstein, the adapter, down a list of ""ghost"" singers. Bully for National Showmanship, the distributors, who opened this film yesterday at the Trans-Lux 85th Street.But the picture itself is less impressive than the surface renovation for American audiences.Based on a vintage folk-comedy by Abraham Goldfaden, the ""father"" of Yiddish theater, energetically played by a host of Israeli players and rooted in traditional lore and humor, the picture is less winning for format and content than for its pretty color, festive spirit and thread of music. This friendly, perfectly harmless enterprise was understandably a big hit in the homeland. But some spectators, mindful of the exotic source and setting, may see the movie as a broad, old-fashioned village diversion of thwarted young love and mistaken identity.The film is as wholesome as it is transparent, with simple, broad, predictable jokes. The tunes by Shaul Barzoweski have a nice ""Fiddler on the Roof"" flavor, but the extremely conventional lyrics are something else (at least in translation). And they are well sung (""ghosted""), to exceptionally ripe, tasteful arrangements. But there simply are not enough tunes to overcome the tedious stretches and drawn-out gags.Front and center, in a demanding double role, is young Mike Burstein, as a personable youth determined to win his girl by a camouflage as the village idiot. Now it is quite probable that the untranslated Israeli original dealt more benignly with this character, who is the main plot device and the chief joke. But the plight of this limping, stuttering, one-eyed dimwit  actually a sweet-spirited little chap  grows increasingly less funny. And one musical dream montage, when he stumbles through a woods, seems downright Freudian, amid all the jollity.As the three main elders, Shmuel Rodensky, Elisheva Michaeli and Raphel Klatschkin, are fine. Rina Ganor is a pretty heroine and Jermaine Unikowsky makes a darling minx of a matchmaker's daughter.

us,Screen: 'Virgin Soldiers':Tragicomedy of Empire Opens at Rendezvous,"YOU can still see them on television, those World War II service dramas, at least 20 years old. They are a special sort, comitragedies, I guess, in which a group of raw recruits stumble through trainingbrawling, drinking, wenchinga laugh a minute, and then all of a sudden they go to battle and get themselves shot to pieces. And always somebody will remain to tell the story, win the medals, get the girl back home.In John Dexter's ""The Virgin Soldiers,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, yet another group ofnot quite rawrecruits trains together and plays together, a laugh maybe every three minutes, and then they go to battle and get themselves shot to pieces. Only now the time is the early 1950's, the place is southeast Asia, the troops are British, and they are not saving Western civilization; they are overseeing the dissolution of the empire. And Brigg (Hywel Bennett), the most important of those who come back from battle, doesn't win the girl or the medals; he merely gets to leave.The virgin soldiers are all occupational misfits. One leans to the right, another leans to the left, most wear thick glasses, and two sleep together. Clerk-typists by assignment, they play battle games across their desks until somebody's blood-soaked records come through, and then they blanch. By night they make timid stabs at sex with the local (Singapore) talent, but by day they mock themselves as they ""stick it in, twist it, pull it out right,"" and learn how to be fierce on the bayonet range. They don't have much fun, and generally, they reflect their world's frustrated dis-ease.All goes fairly badly until a train taking them to a new assignment is ambushed by guerrillas, and then things go very badly indeed. Many die, a few are brave, the braggart sergeant of the bayonet range (Jack Shepherd; a fine broad preformance) panics and locks himself in the toilet, and young Brigg makes an ambiguous escape-rescue.The ambiguity rather than the boldness of the gesture is the point at issue here. Although the movie is never clear about its heroics (there are, for example, moments of unexcused, unexcusable battle sentimentality), its general drift is toward disillusion, bitter bitter-sweetness, and welcome defeat.Performances among the officers and men run a fairly conventional range of British satiric and nonsatiric soldier types. Almost everybody is as good as his role allowswhich is ""good"" within a rather narrow range of character potential. Hywel Bennett's young Brigg appeals by grace of his close-set eyes, puddled brow, and general air of queasiness.Lynn Redgrave plays the sergeant major's daughter, an army brat bored and aggressive. This is the first time I have seen her in a role that is not a caricature of one sort or another, and she is tough, believable, honestly pathetic and winning.At its worst ""The Virgin Soldiers"" indulges in a lot of unfunny, I think unreal, sexual initiation fantasy. That any of this works and even seems to matter says a good deal for Hywel Bennett and Miss Redgrave as performers. But at its best, the movie really does become involved, in small and private ways, with the question of imperialism. The ""enemy,"" the movie knows, and the British troops more or less know, is rightor at least has history on his side. Between the two orders, Eastern and Western, moments of confused confrontation, even one shocking intimate killing, which evokes an awareness a little deeper and sharper and more moving than the films's tired genre requires.",1970-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Molly Maguires':Ritt's Direction Sticks to Conventional Style,"OF course they do still make movies the way they used to, and Martin Ritt, who in the recent past earned a reputation for a certain ambiguous modernism (""Hud"" and ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold""), has now, with ""The Molly Maguires,"" directed a film almost wholly involved with old conventional ways of seeing and old conventional ways of putting together a movie.Nothing about the old conventions, or in the elaborate rhetoric of cranes and tracks, precludes great movie-making. But in ""The Molly Maguires,"" which opened yesterday at the New Forum and Paris theaters, Ritt has so accepted the conventions and succumbed to the rhetoric that he seems less to have seen his movie than to have assembled a plausable sequence of stock responses, stunning devices and generic touches.""The Molly Maguires"" is full of illustrations, but quite without insight. The camera pans not so much to reveal action as to show off the mood and detail of a setting. And on the immensely realistic (and admirably atmospheric) main street of the film's Pennsylvania mining town, one has the feeling that even the dogs run out and bark on cue.The Molly Maguires were a secret society of Irish-American coal miners who in the second half of the 19th century fought by sabotage and murder against their overseers and for better pay in the mines. The mine owners finally subdued them with the aid of a Pinkerton detective, James McParlan, who worked himself into the Molly Maguires, won their confidence, and then identified and testified against their leaders in a trial that cost them their lives.The film attempts to dramatize the situation of McParlan (Richard Harris), torn between his instincts and his interests. He is identified with the workers but assigned to the side of the ownersrepresented solely by one incredibly evil black-coated, black-browed police captain (Frank Finlay), who keeps materializing for rendezvous on hill sides, in mine shafts, and wherever you would not expect him to be.McParlan is intended therefore as a kind of modern hero, with the right reactions and the wrong credentials. Near the beginning, he announces one sort of motivation (""I'm tired of always looking up. I want to look down."") and at the end, when he admits in court that he is a detective, he essentially proclaims another. In between, he sides with the Maguires and gets off one-liners against police brutality while making his secret reports to the captain. This method of seeing both sides amounts to having it both ways, and the film never sustains enough tension within either character or situation to keep each gesture, confrontation or crises from seeming at least slightly gratuitous.The cast, an exceptionally attractive cast, does pretty well considering that only a few of its members have real characterizations they can settle into. Samantha Eggar as the strong-willed girl who loves and leaves McParlan, suffers least because she is allowed the expression of some definable emotions. Sean Connery, the leader of the Molly Maguires, suffers most because his role is the most arbitrarily closed. But when he and Richard Harris act together they create a superb and powerful sense of presence that almost hides the absence of anything very meaningful for them to say. Under the realistic coal dust that begrimes their faces, Harris and Connery wear realistic sun tans. Everybody else is appropriately pale, and the miners as they work cough a lot.Realism without much reality, enormous care for the wrong details, historical accuracy and spineless dramaturgy, ""The Molly Maguires"" vacillates among intentions and settles finally for ponderous spectacle and easy irony. There is a world of difference separating the opening camera movement from rising sun down a strong diagonal structure to the mine entrance itself, and the final shot that imposes McParlan against the gallows he has helped to build.But between the impulses controlling these scenes there is very little to choose. Personally I prefer the well-oiled mechanics of James Wong Howe's camera and the intricacies of Tambi Larson's Hollywood-sound-stage coal mine to the timid positions of Walter Bernstein's screenplay. In any case, both are subject to a directorial hand that mistakes effects for effectiveness and replaces complexity with confusion.",1970-02-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"'My Sweet Charlie,' Interracial Drama, Opens at the Regency","The speed with which ""My Sweet Charlie"" has leaped from television into commercial movie houses is justified. In the faces and eyes of the two principals in this new drama  a pregnant, unwed Southern girl and a young Northern Negro hiding in an abandoned house on the Gulf Coast  there is truth, power and beauty. Superbly played by Patty Duke and Al Freeman Jr., the emerging characters of these two young people in their initial racial friction, personal torment and eventual understanding make for an intelligent but flawed film, definitely worth seeing at the Regency, where it opened yesterday.Nicely photographed in color on a sparsely populated strip of the Gulf Coast, this Universal release is essentially a dialogue, encased in a melodramatic frame, a dutiful, obvious device that cues in some theatrical touches. The story, adapted from David Westheimer's novel and play by Richard Levinson and William Link, will be predictable to anybody who has seen a movie in the last 20 years.From the moment the frightened heroine screams ""Nigger!"" at the other intruder on the remote premises, we know that these two lonely young fugitives eventually will, learn from each other understanding and simple human values. And looking at their plight squarely, some viewers may wonder if the drama would have stronger, more meaningful or perhaps even more honest with the intellectual scales more balanced.The young Negro portrayed by Mr. Freeman, an articulate, activist lawyer from the North who has killed a Southerner in self-defense, is exceptional. The Dixie girl, an equally stubborn but inarticulate redneck, is not. What matters is the wonderfully true, moving and meshed performances of Mr. Freeman and Miss Duke under Lamont Johnson's searching direction.The picture slips from reality in contrived touches. A climactic scene, in which Mr. Freeman tangles with a stereotype of a tolerant white storekeeper, is as phony as it can be. And the fade-out, rather than being poignant, is flat.""My Sweet Charlie"" has some serious flaws as rounded drama, but its Charles Roberts and Marlene Chambers are real.",1970-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Of Sin and Death:Yugoslav's 'An Event' Is Based on Chekhov,"VATROSLAV MIMICA'S ""An Event,"" which opened yesterday at the 34th Street East Theater, presents a curious case in that it goes from very good to very bad in relatively well-marked stages. Even at its best, it is a skillful and careful rather than an adventurous movie, and seeing ""An Event"" is a little like watching what appears to be the first-prize work of a film school valedictorian at the beginning, degenerate into the last act of a high school play by the end.Mimica, born in 1923, is one of the older of the Yugoslav directors, and one of the few to have had any exposure here. ""Kaya, I'll Kill You,"" his sixth feature, played at the 1968 New York Film Festival and opened commercially last year. ""An Event,"" which, like ""Kaya,"" is a murder movie, is based on a Chekhov story, and the demands of the fiction ultimately do more to hinder than to help the director's generally interesting visual program.A boy and his grandfather set out for market to sell a horse. The way, which leads through a forest, is misty and menacing, and they arrive only after having just escaped a stray wolf. With money from selling the horse, they start back in plenty of time to reach home before nightfall. But soon they are overtaken by an evil gamekeeper and his friend, ""Sin and Death,"" the local ferryman calls them, and the grandfather gives the boy the money, and he sends him on alone.Everything so far in ""An Event"" works  even down to the greenish color photography, which, probably unintentionally, casts an aura of unreality over the most familiar objects and actions. This part of the film is concerned with premonition, and, in the face of jet planes, cars, radios, and the standard modern paraphernalia, with presenting, quite without condescension, a community for which ""premonition"" is a viable state of mind. Mimica, therefore, plays around the edges of the supernatural, in which he succeeds admirably, so juxtaposing faces and landscapes, close-ups and long shots, as ever so slightly to animate his world beyond the requirements of specific events.But events take over, and the film begins living up to its name too energetically. Spectral quality is supplanted by violent action, which is not Mimica's forte. When the assailants confront the grandfather, supernature gives way to human nature. And for the closing coincidences, in the gamekeeper's cottage, with his wife and daughter and friend, and with the grandson hidden in his loft, ""An Event"" descends to horrendous melodrama. At the bloody climax, a handy transistor radio blares out a Beethoven symphony, but nothing can hide the natural affinity of this material for the lower reaches of grand opera.At the head of the fine cast, Pavle Vuisic as the grandfather and Sergio Mimica as the son perform with a generic truthfulness that looks second nature but must be achieved art, and that seems typical of recent Yugoslav movies. And for the time that she remains an enigma, Neda Spasojevio, the gamekeeper's young wifepretty, slatternly, kindly and suspiciousis the perfect image of what you might dream and fear to find in a little cottage in the deepest forest just as light is failing and, with it, all hope of safety.",1970-02-17T05:00:00+0000

The picture is neither.With extraordinary alacrity, technical skill and plain common sense, Strick (and Betty Botley, his colleague) has lifted Miller's rambling, sizzling narrative off the printed page and shaped a vibrantly blunt and lifelike eyeful that either follows or suggests the original, retaining most of the key characters and situations. Add a brilliantly right personification of Miller by Rip Torn, whose labyrinthine wanderings about Paris are superbly evoked by the beautiful color photography of Alain de Robe.Add (straight from the book) the frankest and the filthiest flow of expletives, Anglo-Saxon and otherwise, ever to spew forth from a commercial, publicly shown movie feature, on these shores, at least. Wearying as the barrage becomes, the shock is acoustical, not visual. For all the blistering language, in a movie whose hero's primary concern is sex there is only a smattering or semi-clad, amorous intertwining and some casual, frontal female nudity.Another curiosity wrought by Strick is that the setting of the original, which was indelibly stamped with the nineteen-thirties of expatriate Americans, has been so subtly updated to the present as to be hardly noticeable. This becoming touch adds dimension, if not real stature, which is where Strick's towering transition of Joyce's ""Ulysses"" has it all over ""Tropic of Cancer.""Even with the splendid performances of the entire cast, with a freshness of comparatively unknown faces in the featured roles, the film succeeds best on the level of a comic, sexual adventure of a man obsessed and motivated by one thing.On this level of lust, for about two-thirds of the way, the picture is brazenly sly, boldly fatalistic and often hilarious, all of it mirrored in the face of the curly haired Torn, with his bland drawl and piercing eyes. In a mercurical rhythm of tight sparse images the camera lets Torn rip, as he wheedles cash and lodging from a group of friends, seducing and re-seducing, eyeing wives, mistresses and new quarries, and lending a friendly, lascivious ear to the sexual hang-ups of his pals.The acting, and acting it is, remains unflawed by a cast that includes Ellen Burstyn, David Bauer, Phil Brown, Ginette LeClerc, Dominique Delpierre, Giselle Grimm, Magali Noel and others. Miller himself appears for a second inside a crowded church. But the picture loses routing toward the end, when it casually but purposefully involves the hero in the plight of a homesick, neurotic pal, memorably played by James Callahan, and his fiery mistress, a comely brunette named Laurence Ligneres.This closing chapter also was in a summary philosophy, from Miller's mouthpiece, an exuberantly defiant stream-of-consciousness about a lone man against the world. Torn speaks it at the fade-out, standing in an open taxi, in a retreating camera shot that suggests a suspended head crossing the Seine on a straight level.Intended or not, this is the definitive image of Miller's high life that Strick has transplanted with such surprising, practical fidelity. It is all effect, not substance, a soulless business anchored to the groin, with no simple warmth or feeling and no real body, although Torn states his case clearly enough: ""Above allthe ecstasy.""When the movie runs out of steam, it leaves only a shiftless, conventionally cynical and foul-mouthed bucko who couldn't matter less, even with mouth closed.",1970-02-20T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Au Hasard, Balthazar':Bresson Feature Opens at the New Yorker","ROBERT BRESSON'S ""Au Hasard, Balthazar"" first played in New York at the 1966 Film Festival, at which time it received mostly unfavorable notices. That it is having a theatrical opening now results largely from the perseverance of Cinema Ventures' Tom Russell and the New Yorker Theater's Dan Talbotwho has done so much for movies in this city that he probably deserves a review of his own.Actually, Bresson, despite a general critical indifference and commercial failure that puts him in the company of the very greatest filmmakers (Carl Dreyer, for example) has never lacked for serious admirers. And the exceptional popularity of the recently completed Bresson retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art suggests that a much larger audience may be ready for him now than had ever heard of him only a few years ago.Along with the early ""Les Dimes du Bois de Boulogne"" (1944), ""Au Hasard, Balthazar"" (the title translates literally as ""Balthazar at Random"") is my favorite among Bresson's nine features. It is at once his most complex and most accessible movie, which should not seem so strange in light of the kinds of films he makes.His profoundly and unsentimentally religious vision and the severity and self-abnegation of his method set up certain expectations for any Bresson movie in relation to which ""Au Hasard, Balthazar"" looks like a sudden and gratifying relaxation in style. In fact, it is less austere (though possibly even more severe), than other Bresson films, and the multiplicity of things and themes (and things as theme), together with Bresson's most appealing hero, works for an unusual degree of audience empathy.That hero, Balthazar, is a donkey who, after a happy early life with Marie (Anne Wiazemsky), daughter of a scientific farmer, is sold into harsh toil and exploitation at the hands of a series of masters. Meanwhile, Marie's family suffers through her father's proud stubbornness, and she herself into humiliating liaison with Grard, leader of the genuinely vicious local young hoods. Periodically Marie and Balthazar are reunited, but at each reunion Grard reappears (in a sense, Balthazar prepares for Grard) to take the girl and to torture the donkey.By the time he has finished, Grardwhose evil is never explained but who adequately answers one set of his community's needs, just as Balthazar answers another set of needshas stripped Marie naked and abandoned her in an empty house, and he has loaded the donkey with contraband silks, gold, and perfume, which he means to smuggle across the border. The ensuing death of Balthazar, less a surprise than a summation, is in its pathos and depth of association the most richly evocative sequence in all of Bresson and surely one of the most affecting passages in the history of film.Where ""Au Hasard, Balthazar"" differs from Bresson's other films is in the degree to which it accepts and sustains a multiplicity of actions, objects, even, in an almost traditional sense, ""character."" Not that Bresson has lowered his vision (the film's range of associations in symbol and dogma should occupy any amateur of Christian theology for some time) but that he has expanded it to include a superbly precise and compassionate awareness of the physical universe.In this film we are given not only the movements of souls and bodies, but also the knowledge of hands and hearts and of the ground we walk on.""Au Hasard, Balthazar"" proceeds by contrariesbeginning with the sound track, which opens with a Schubert piano sonata rudely interrupted by a donkey's braying that lead to insights traditionally understandable only in terms of paradox. This is neither an easy film, nor, in the show biz sense, an entertaining one. It makes large demands upon its audience, and in return confers exceptional rewards. It is playing at the New Yorker Theater, and among recent openings it is the only absolutely essential moviegoing in New York.",1970-02-20T05:00:00+0000

Before World War II, the peacetime military establishment was small and com posed entirely of regularsa caste that tended to be distinct from the rest of the population. Its officers came from West Point or Annapolis, married the daughters of other regu lars and sent their sons to West Point or Annapolis. Enlisted men got drunk on payday and drunker at the expira tion of every hitch, after which they staggered back to the post and re enlisted. When they landed in the brig or guardhouse, which was fre quently, the civilian public cared about the fairness of the proceedings no more than it cared about the system of criminal justice applicable to other foreigners, such as Chinese coolies. Neither the Supreme Court nor anyone else ever supposed that the Bill of Rights applied to soldiers. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase said in 1867 that the power of Congress in the government of the land and naval forces ... is not at all affected by the Fifth or any other amend ment, and the proposition was scarcely challenged until after World War II.",1970-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'Long Ride From Hell' Stars Steve Reeves,"""A LONG RIDE FROM HELL"" is a minor revenge Western of the contemporary Italian school made notable by the lean, elegiac work of Sergio Leone. It stars Steve Reeves who, in his youth, went into muscles instead of mutual funds. The muscles looked great in ""Hercules"" and ""Goliath and the Barbarians"" but they give the actor a peculiar silhouette on the range. As a result of his enlarged latissimus dorsi, Reeves stands tall only as the most round-shouldered gun in the West.The film was directed by Alex Burks, who seems to have learned his craft in that Marlboro country, where the sun never sets but is always directly behind the man with the cigarette. Burks also photographs almost every scene from a fixed position with a camera equipped with a zoom lens. The effect is disorientating, like being perched on the slide of a giant trombone.""A Long Ride From Hell,"" which opened yesterday at the DeMille Theater, is dubbed with basic English dialogue and quite badly synchronized sounds of fists hitting flesh, grunts, shots and hoofbeats.",1970-02-26T05:00:00+0000
