There were no known survivors aboard the plane carrying 269 people on a flight from New York to Seoul. American, Soviet and Japanese ships and planes fruitlessly searched the frigid seas north of Japan where the airliner apparently went down. There was an unconfirmed report that the long-missing plane had experienced radio difficulties and thus may have been unable to hear or respond to any Soviet warnings, but there was no clear explanation for the attack. (Page A1, Col. 6.) Moscow was silent for nearly 24 hours and then confirmed that its fighters had intercepted and warned ''an unidentified plane'' that it was intruding on Soviet air space. But the late report by the official press agency Tass made no mention of any attack on the South Korean airliner. (A1:3.)",1983-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Moreover, the increase was accompanied by another strong gain in employment and other positive figures, prompting experts to say that the strong labor-market improvement since early winter is, in effect, continuing. The jobless rate for the civilian labor force was unchanged at 9.5 percent. (Page 1.) New York City's jobless rate in August was unchanged at 10.6 percent. (9.) Despite the recent recession, employment among women has shown strong growth. (9.)

There is no longer any expectation of an early withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces from Lebanon or of a wider negotiation. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who came to office last summer dedicated to pursuing with vigor a solution to the endemic Middle East issues, seemed a bit defensive at a news conference last week. ''The job is long and difficult, and requires patience and determination,'' he said. The irony was not lost on State Department officials, who remarked that a year ago, President Reagan was outlining sweeping ideas for settling such issues as the Palestinian problem and Israel's ultimate borders. His attention is now devoted to bringing about an end to the street fighting in Beirut, avoiding involvement of the marines there in a civil war, and figuring out Israel's conduct with Menachem Begin no longer in command. Many in Congress are questioning, in the light of the death of two marines last week, whether the United States should assume the role of mediator between ethnic and religious factions that have been at each other's throats for years. There have been many miscalculations in the past year, notably the decision by Mr. Reagan to start his peace initiative before there had been a conclusion of the Lebanese crisis. His peace program - which ruled out Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank - immediately antagonized Mr. Begin and led to a period in which the Israelis openly tried to sabotage American efforts.",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

Among other things, the advent of fall marks the beginning of a politically testing season. First and foremost, it is to be the season of the missiles. Unless, by some miracle, American negotiators can wrest a last- minute agreement from the Soviet Union at Geneva, the next few months - the exact dates have not been made public - will see the deployment of United States cruise missiles in West Germany and in Britain. The consequences are hard for anyone to calculate. Chancellor Helmut Kohl disparages predictions of a ''hot autumn'' in West Germany, but he is all but alone in doing so; the general expectation in Bonn is that he will spend much of his time in the weeks to come dealing with a campaign of hunger strikes, protest marches and attempted blockades of NATO bases. The antinuclear movement gave a preview last week with a peaceful demonstration that featured Heinrich B""oll, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, some members of Parliament and about 1,000 other people outside the gates of a United States Army base in Mutlangen where Pershing 2's are due to be installed. Base officials refrained from calling in the police, which helped keep things quiet. What Mr. Kohl must try to avoid, his aides say, is the creation of a martyr or the involvement of American soldiers in a violent incident, either of which could convince the German public that the missiles are more of a threat than the Soviet threat they are meant to neutralize.",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

This week, the Government is planning celebrations but they are shadowed by questions as to how much longer the regime can survive. Two years of economic depression have brought popular discontent and demands for General Pinochet's resignation. At least 34 people have been killed in four nationwide protests called by opposition political and labor leaders over the last four months. The fifth protest is planned for Thursday. And late last month, terrorists assassinated Carol Urzua, a retired major general who was chief administrator of Santiago, the capital. He was the highest-ranking official killed since the coup. During last month's day of protest, General Pinochet tried cracking down, sending 18,000 army troops into the streets of Santiago to curb demonstrators. But the tough tactics backfired. The resulting melee of wild shooting led to 24 deaths, increasing opposition resolve and drawing international criticism, notably from the normally friendly Reagan Administration. Perhaps equally important, the violence upset foreign bankers and creditors. General Pinochet is now trying a softer approach. His new Interior Minister, Enrique Jarpa Reyes, has begun the regime's first dialogue with the opposition in a decade and has offered the beginnings of a transition to democracy. He also promised to legalize political parties next year and to hold Congressional elections well before the scheduled date of 1990.

Amused by their chatter, instantly infatuated with a bright beauty who's the eldest girl in the group, the narrator finds himself under compulsion to entertain. He launches a ''long story about Palestine,'' then races on - his imagination freed - ''because they were children, more or less'' - to wilder stuff. ''I spoke of impossible battles . . . of feats of endurance which made me reel merely in imagining them, of horses that flew, and golden shafts of light, pillars of fire, miracles here and there . . . anything which seemed as if it might be believed.''",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

Lehrman agreed during their gubernatorial race last year was the need to bring the semi-independent Metropolitan Transportation Authority under state control. Someone, both candidates argued, had to make the M.T.A. accountable. People who were forced to endure dirty subway cars and perpetually late commuter trains had to be given the chance to vote out those who were responsible - or so the candidates maintained. But positions articulated coolly in the midst of a fall election campaign can wilt quickly in the hot August reality of running the nation's largest mass-transit system. Last week, Governor Cuomo was presented with the first opportunity to place his stamp on the M.T.A., an agency he had often said he wished to bring under his wing since taking office eight months ago. But rather than embrace the opportunity, the Governor ultimately shied away. Many familiar with the M.T.A. continued to debate the merits of the agency's independence, but the fact of its autonomy was as firm by the end of the week as it had been at the beginning. On Monday, Richard Ravitch unexpectedly resigned as M.T.A. chairman, catching the Cuomo adminstration off guard. The Governor and his top aides spent several days scrambling to define a position. Mr. Cuomo remained wedded to his belief that the M.T.A., if it should not be abolished, should at least be restructured and brought under the direct control of the Governor.",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

In Bogota, for the first time in three years, Salvadoran officials faced insurgents from their own country, one of whom had recently fled to Mexico after being released from a Salvadoran jail. The following day in San Jose, Richard B. Stone, the Reagan Administration's special envoy to Central America, talked for three hours with four Salvadoran leftist leaders. The meetings made for interesting pictures, but the participants' statements afterward indicated they had found little common ground or readiness to compromise. The Salvadoran Government has authorized its Peace Commission to discuss only the left's participation in presidential elections, which are tentatively set for some time in the first three months of next year. The Salvadoran left has flatly rejected any interest in those elections. They want to be incorporated in a provisional Government that would then oversee elections for mayors as well as deputies to the 60-member Constituent Assembly. American and Salvadoran officials skeptical of the whole process believe that the negotiating activity is merely a propoganda ploy for all sides. As long as meetings are being held, the Reagan Administration and the Salvadoran Government can demonstrate to Congress that they are trying to reach a political settlement.

us,"FOR WALESA, SOME CHEERS AND AND UNCHEERFUL FUTURE","Striding toward the Gdansk shipyards last week, a big bundle of flowers in his arms and a chanting, cheering crowd at his back, Lech Walesa looked like a leader again, at least for a moment. It was the third anniversary of the Aug. 31 signing of an agreement with shipyard strikers that gave birth to Solidarity, the first and last independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. The Polish authorities saturated the streets of Gdansk, Warsaw, Nowa Huta, Wroclaw and other major cities with riot police to snuff out any dissent left after more than 18 months of military rule. Nevertheless, tens of thousands managed to demonstrate support for the outlawed Solidarity - some by battling with the police, many by going to special masses in Roman Catholic churches. In the process, they restored some of Mr. Walesa's luster. ''Lechu, Lechu,'' shouted the jubilant crowds that managed to rally around St. Bridget's Church in Gdansk, using the familiar form of his name. Crowds in other cities also chanted the name of the man authorities had scorned as ''the former head of the former union.'' It has been a difficult time for Mr. Walesa and the movement he symbolizes. The Government, even as it announced the lifting of martial law in July, kept sweeping powers to control the streets and factories; it has shown little reluctance to use them. The beleaguered underground has yet to come up with effective tactics. Mr. Walesa has seemed vacillating and uncertain, even worrying in public about going to jail.",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000
us,PLANE TRAGEDY POSES TOUGH EAST-WEST ISSUES,"Ever so rarely, something happens that cuts through the ambiguities of politics and proves a point. Last week, a Soviet fighter plane shot down a South Korean passenger airliner that had strayed over Soviet territory, killing 269 people. The point, if it needed reaffirmation, was that the leadership of the Soviet Union is different - call it tougher, more brutal or even uncivilized - than most of the rest of the world. President Reagan said the incident was ''horrifying'' and cause for ''revulsion,'' whatever the exact or possibly extenuating circumstances. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and its intimidation of Poland may be explained away, at least in part, as power politics. But not this and not acts such as trumping up charges against dissidents, not inhuman and elemental acts, to judge by the reaction from Congress and elsewhere. Nevertheless, the Reagan Administration was still left with the question of how to respond in other than feeble, symbolic or self-defeating ways, and what to do, more generally, about Soviet-American relations. In the short run, the incident lends great weight to Mr. Reagan's portrayal of the Soviet Union as an ''evil empire.'' It strengthens him politically on the Pentagon budget and Central America and diplomatically in marshaling support in Europe for deploying new missiles. But in the long run, the harder Mr. Reagan comes down on Moscow now, the more difficult it will be to improve relations later. By Presidential election time, he may need to show progress in reducing Soviet-American tensions and producing an arms control treaty.",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

He expected it to be a summer job that would continue on a part-time basis when he returned for his sophomore year at City College. Instead of going back to college this month, however, Mr. Thomson has decided to enter a 10-week training program to become a manager in the Roy Rogers chain. The fast-food business, he says, has more appeal than college. More young people may be following a similar route during the 1980's. Despite the attention lavished on employment opportunities in high technology and computers, most jobs available this decade will be decidedly low-tech. Reports from the Federal Government's Bureau of Labor Statistics show the greatest demand - in descending order - will be for secretaries, nurses' aides and orderlies, janitors, sales clerks, cashiers, nurses, truck drivers, fast-food workers, office clerks, waiters and waitresses. Jobs for programmers, systems analysts, operaters, data entry workers and other computer specialists will account for only 5 percent of the employment growth during the 1980's, bureau statistics show. Meanwhile, 75 percent of all young people today graduate from high school; about 33 percent spend some time in college. For high school and college students, the push for computer literacy is on. But as Herbert Bienstock, director of the Center for Labor and Urban Programs, Research and Analysis at Queens College, noted: ''Most jobs in this country require very little in the way of skill development or training.''",1983-09-04T05:00:00+0000

The rise, following hefty advances in earlier months, was the smallest in nearly a year. There were other signs, too, in July that expansion had slowed: New factory orders fell 1.7 percent; new- home sales dipped 6.5 percent, and civilian unemployment flattened at 9.5 percent. But, according to preliminary reports from the nation's largest retailers, consumer spending perked up in August - a cue that the cooling-off period may be short-lived.

One obvious solution is organization. A poorly coordinated wardrobe can make it difficult for anyone to be well dressed.

Umbrellas come out - black brollies for the laity and paper- and-bamboo hti for monks. Everybody runs for cover. It's time for tea or sleep, and after a while the sun appears, turning the pavements into mirrors for swirls of pigeons. This is Rangoon in the wet season, from May to October. Veterans call midwinter better - it is dry then and almost brisk at night. But the Burmese capital has its charms in the rain, which lets up often enough. They say the pagodas of Pagan in Upper Burma are even more unearthly than Rangoon's 368-foot-high Shwe Dagon. But you have to travel to Rangoon to get up north, and Rangoon isn't quite like going to Chicago. It's a crumbling city - nothing physical has changed much since the 1930's - and it brings out the mock-romantic in some visitors. One day in the barrel-vaulted dining room of the old Strand Hotel, a group of youngish Western tourists gathered around a spotted tablecloth to plot their next move. Tibet? The Amazon?

Sunset nears, signaling the start of a daily pilgrimage. Settling into the bouncy rhythm and clatter of the pony's unhurried gait, the foreigners are conveyed along Pagan's dusty plain to a tall pagoda. The driver collects all footwear and sends his passengers up its warm stone steps. Once they are at the top, the light waning, the scorched brown earth begins to grow coppery. Whitewashed columns and walls take on burning hues and even plain brick is fired brilliant oranges and reds.

In fact, the topics of many of this fall's major movies will be topical indeed, with dramas about an American photojournalist in Nicaragua, a woman lawyer in Israel who falls in love with a Palestinian, a band of anti-nuclear terrorists who hold a group of American officials hostage, a group of veterans who go back to Vietnam to rescue their buddies from a prison camp, and the death of a worker in a nuclear plant. These are hardly laughing matters, so it's just as well that the fall schedule also includes an unusual abundance of comic relief.

It is called the Garden Isle and of the more developed islands in the Hawaiian chain - Maui, Oahu (home of Honolulu and Waikiki Beach) and the Big Island of Hawaii with its Kona Coast - Kauai is, indeed, the most gorgeous, the least built upon and hence still the most natural. In 10 years, it may, of course, succumb to condo fever, like Maui, but for now Kauai boasts a blissful quantity of unspoiled beaches, unpeopled mountains/valleys/canyons, citizens relatively untainted by too many big tourist bucks and mile upon mile of untouched beauty.",1983-09-11T05:00:00+0000

The vehicle for this financial sleight-of-hand was an ''educational benefit trust'' set up by a four-doctor professional corporation to pay the future college expenses of its employees' children. It made annual contributions to the trust out of pretax profits and planned to disburse the funds to the colleges attended by the children. The trust was established at a local bank and an unrelated employee benefits consultant served as trustee. Every employee of the corporation - not just its physician shareholders - was eligible for tuition payments. They could receive up to $4,000 annually per child between the age of 18 and 29 who enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program at an accredited college or university. Each child qualified for up to four years of benefits and there were no restrictions on eligibility; benefits were payable without regard to grades or need. But all benefits would end if the parent left the corporation for reasons other than retirement or disability. The forfeited amount would not revert to the corporation or shareholders, but would be reapplied to the trust to trim future contributions. The corporation - Greensboro Pathology Associates, based in Greensboro, N.C. - said that the educational benefit plan was necessary to attract and retain high-caliber employees, and each year it deducted its contributions to the trust as a business expense.",1983-09-18T05:00:00+0000

His latest book, ''Reformation of Church and Dogma (1300 to 1700),'' will be published later this year. By Jaroslav Pelikan, THE MOST EXCITING AND MOST CONTROVERSIAL figure in Christian thought today is probably a man who was born 500 hundred years ago. Martin Luther had beliefs about devils and witches that even fundamentalists regard as excessively literal. He advocated obedience to government in a way that democrats find offensive. He spoke about the Pope and about Jews in language that even his most fervent apologists cannot really defend. He could be stubborn and cantankerous and something of a bully. And yet . . . . And yet, in every generation since his own, Luther has been a source of insight and inspiration to his enemies no less than to his followers. This year, everybody seems to be celebrating the anniversary of his birth, on Nov. 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Saxony, now part of the German Democratic Republic. Officially Marxist though it is, East Germany, which had previously regarded him as an enemy of peasant revolts, has now decided to accent such positive aspects of Luther's legacy as the encouragement of his work ethic and has invested millions of marks in refurbishing the churches, monasteries and theological libraries associated with the history of Luther's Reformation. Calling the Wartburg Castle, where Luther hid from his persecutors, a ''landmark of German history,'' Erich Honecker, the East German Communist leader, earlier this year said that visits to it by East Germans would strengthen their ''feelings of nationality and homeland.''",1983-09-18T05:00:00+0000

Tolkien's chronicle of all that happened in his imaginary kingdoms of towers, dwarfs, elves and men before ''The Lord of the Rings'' takes the form of a collection of legends that features some particularly memorable devil figures. Reviewing the book in 1977, John Gardner said, ''What is finally most moving is not the individual legends but the total vision, the eccentric heroism of Tolkien's attempt . . . to rejuvenate the medieval Christian way of seeing and feeling, although - as all his legends reiterate - we can no longer see clearly . . . and our main feeling is now tragic dread.''",1983-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,DECIDING WHO MAKES FOREIGN POLICY,"Zbigniew Brzezinski, who headed the National Security Council under President Carter, is author of the book ''Power and Principle.'' This article has been adapted from a recent speech before the National Press Club. By Zbigniew Brzezinski If one thing should have been made clear by George P. Shultz's current stewardship as Secretary of State, it is that the besetting problem of who makes foreign policy is not the product of a conflict of personalities. The issue, as posed in recent years, is whether primacy in the area belongs in the State Department or in the National Security Council (N.S.C.). When Henry Kissinger headed the N.S.C. in the Nixon White House, it was alleged to be his ego and his taste for the Machiavellian that kept the Secretary of State, William P. Rogers, out of the center of things. When I occupied the same White House post under President Carter, it was said that my instinct for the jugular gave the N.S.C. an excessive share of foreign-policy initiatives, at the expense of Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance. Yet in Mr. Shultz and the current N.S.C. chief, William P. Clark, we have two men who, to all appearances, enjoy a relationship untroubled by ego trips in either direction. Indeed, Mr.Clark is generally perceived as not deeply involved in the complex substance of key foreign issues. Nonetheless, in recent months, the press has noted that influence has been gravitating away from the experienced Mr. Shultz to the able but relatively inexpert Mr. Clark.",1983-09-18T05:00:00+0000

The company, which opened triumphantly with Massenet's exquisite fairy-tale opera, ''Cendrillon,'' came back last night with a more heavy-handed kind of tale, Puccini's ''Turandot,'' as its second offering.

What it could not offer, however, was a ''Turandot'' that went beyond noisy sensation. The blame goes first of all to Puccini himself, who never wrote a more empty or brutal work, but it must be shared by Franco Alfano, who finished the last act in the same crude style after Puccini's death. On this occasion, too, the opera got little help from the two leading singers or the conductor.",1983-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,A 'FLASH' REPORT CHEERS WASHINGTON,"The recovery remains vigorous and the Reagan Administration is purring. The Government's so-called ''flash'' report on third-quarter growth showed a strong 7 percent annual rate of expansion after adjusting for inflation. This was down from an overheated 9.7 percent level of growth in the gross national product in the second quarter. ''We're really on track,'' said the President's chief economist, Martin Feldstein, ''a track that can really be sustained.'' Yet Mr. Feldstein also took the opportunity to dampen the celebration. He warned again that the deficit was still too high. A goodly infusion of economic strength came from housing, which showed surprising vigor in August after an almost equally robust July performance. Despite a two-percentage-point rise in mortgage rates this summer, work began on new houses at an annual rate of 1.94 million units - the highest level in four and a half years. As for inflation, the Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, helped by the first jump in food prices in three months.",1983-09-25T05:00:00+0000

With ''True West'' nearly a year into its run at the Cherry Lane, ''Fool for Love'' thriving at Circle Rep, and ''Superstitions'' and ''The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill'' just arrived at La Mama, it is clear that he has cast a much more than ordinary spell over the theatrical faithful; no bad thing in my view, and perhaps no surprising one either, given the competition currently about.

In lighting, for example, one manufacturer, Norelco, has created a fluorescent bulb that promises to combine the esthetic and psychological advantages of incandescent light with the energy efficiency of fluorescent - a substantive advance unrelated to style. In fact, in furniture and fabrics as well as lighting, for the first time in decades, the heated pursuit of a ''new look'' has been eclipsed by another, perhaps more solid goal: the quest for quality.",1983-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Fifty miles south of Kanchenjunga, on a massive curve of mountain ridge, lies Darjeeling, the City of the Thunderbolt. It gets this epithet from the electrical storms that beset the Himalayas and from the dorje, or thunderbolt, of tantric worship. For the Hindus and Buddhists, whose temples and monasteries are found in abundance around Darjeeling, the thunderbolt stands for the wild processes of creation. Darjeeling is a witness to the spiritual power of the Himalayas where Lepchas, Tibetans, Bhutias, Nepalese and Bengalis live in the vast shadow of a range of mountains that has encouraged religious thought and art for a thousand years. There is another Darjeeling. It is the vacation spot whose appeal has been its brisk air and grand scenery ever since the British Raj, more than a century ago, headed for the northern tip of West Bengal by palanquin, boat and pony to escape the hot flat sprawl of teeming Calcutta. This is the Darjeeling of resort hotels, antiques shops and mountain excursions.

Orechio convenes his house in a session that was scheduled for tomorrow, the stage will be set for what may be the climactic act in a classic struggle between the Governor and the Legislature. The conflict turns on custom - an unwritten rule called senatorial courtesy that allows a lone Senator to block a gubernatorial appointment. The privilege has frustrated governors for decades and last week Governor Kean, no less nettled than his predecessors, labeled the practice ''insidious'' and an ''egregious example of how bad the system is.'' Mr. Kean's ire was directed at State Senator Gerald Cardinale, a fellow Republican from Demarest, who invoked the privilege to block the reappointment of Sylvia B. Pressler, a judge in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Mr. Cardinale said he had received many complaints about the judge's demeanor on the bench and the way in which she decided cases that came before her. The judge refused comment, but her supporters began a vigorous campaign in her defense. The Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, Robert N. Wilentz, called Judge Pressler ''one of the most outstanding members'' of the state's judiciary, who has a ''mastery of the substantive law'' and who is the ''most highly respected authority in the state on legal practice and procedure.''

Solemnly, he gave his undergraduate audience a rigid salute. The white, rosy-cheeked expressions turned up to him could not have been more earnest had they been in church. And the general easily slipped into an evangelist's role, depicting a conflict between forces of light and darkness. The former, it went without saying, were well represented in this lecture hall at the University of the Orange Free State in Bloemfontein, an Afrikaans-language citadel not noted for its tolerance of wayward ideas. The forces of darkness were the ''terrorists,'' black South Africans manipulated by the ''dragon'' of international Communism. It was exactly what might have been expected in Bloemfontein, except for one conspicuous detail: The general, Xhanti Charles Sebe, Director of State Security of the supposedly independent ''homeland'' of Ciskei, was black. More than pigmentation made him a surprising figure. A handful of young Afrikaners in the hall seemed uneasily aware that here was a black man who surpassed them in ideological commitment; from their point of view, he was almost too good to be true. The coiled energy and enthusiasm in the man came out in a gravelly voice and staccato articulation.

The imperial mosques were constructed by the Sultans for themselves and their immediate families between the Ottoman conquest in 1453 and the mid-18th century. They are not necessarily the most beautiful or pleasing. Frequently, the smaller mosques achieve greatness because of the constraints of money and space that the architects had to observe.

For Robert Walker's unfinished scenes in ''My Son John'' (1952), the director was forced to rely on out-takes from Mr. Walker's preceding film, ''Strangers on a Train.'' In the case of ''Giant'' (1956), James Dean had completed principle photography a few days before he died in a car crash, but some of his scenes were inaudible and needed to be redubbed; in the climactic scene, his drunken speech to an empty banquet hall was rerecorded by Mr. Dean's friend, the actor Nick Adams.
