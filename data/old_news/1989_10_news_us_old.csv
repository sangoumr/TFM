Scott Fitzgerald and Andre Gide, Norman Douglas and Lawrence Durrell. Whether I visited Spain's Costa del Sol or a Greek island, the French Riviera or the ruins at Carthage, the roads were clogged with cars, the beaches seemed a solid rump- and bosom-scape of tanning bodies, and the sea was iridescent with oil slicks and dead fish.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Copland: 'Appalachian Spring' Suite, 'Short Symphony' and Other Works Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 335; CD and cassette. Copland originally wrote ''Appalachian Spring'' for 13 instruments, all that could fit in the pit for the 1944 premiere of the Martha Graham ballet - a version he suppressed once the suite for full orchestra caught on. With his concise and rhythmically exciting ''Short Symphony'' (1933) he did something of the reverse; since it proved too difficult for many orchestras, he made a sextet setting, which we are likelier to encounter. Here are variants on both originals - the ''Spring'' Suite in a chamber orchestration (the 13 instruments plus extra strings), the symphony in a chamber orchestra reduction devised by Dennis Russell Davies - along with chamber orchestra renditions of ''Quiet City'' and ''Three Latin American Sketches.'' Orpheus plays with verve if not an especially original point of view. In DG's recording, close and striking, the ''Short Symphony'' is a real grabber. - Mark Swed Richard Strauss: 'Aus Italien,' Four Orchestral Songs Felicity Lott, soprano (Songs); Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Chandos 8744; all three formats. Like Mendelssohn and Berlioz before and Elgar after him, Richard Strauss knew how to capture his glowing youthful Italian impressions in music. The designation ''Symphonic Fantasy'' fits the early ''Aus Italien'' (1886) well. Those who tend to dismiss it as a ''travelogue'' because of its symphonic elaboration of the familiar ''Funiculi, Funicula'' in the final movement are bound to overlook the subtleties and splendid colors of the preceding three - particularly the third movement (''On the Shores of Sorrento''), which points ahead to later Strauss. The performance, apparently the first on CD, is vigorously led by Neeme Jarvi and, save for a tremulous oboe solo, well played. The songs - ''Winterweihe,'' ''Mein Auge,'' ''Der Rosenband'' and ''Befreit,'' rapturous utterances in radiant orchestral settings - are faultlessly sung by Felicity Lott. - George Jellinek 'New Music Series,' Vol. 1: Works by Korde, Lippe, Mabry, Risset, Rubin, Scelsi and Xenakis Robert Black, double bass; Walter van Hawe, alto recorder; Mel Cuthbertson, tuba; Holy Cross Chamber Players conducted by Toshimasa Francis Wada. Neuma CD 450-71; CD only. Neuma, a label based in Acton, Mass., offers seven recent works in a sampler reminiscent of the new-music collections the major labels offered in the 1960's; indeed, a 60's avant-garde esthetic pervades the disk. Most enjoyable are two electronic pieces. Jean-Claude Risset's ''Contours,'' a tactile and sometimes spacily atmospheric work, is a study in thematic transformation; and Anna Rubin's ''Crying the Laughing and Golden'' uses the sound of laughter and whispering to create an evocative, intensely emotional soundscape. Interesting too are the glittering, variegated ''Chamber Piece'' by Shirish Korde, and Drake Mabry's ''12.5.83,'' a fleet virtuosic essay for alto recorder. - Allan Kozinn Mendelssohn: Concertos in D minor: for Violin and Strings; for Violin, Piano and Strings Gidon Kremer, violin; Martha Argerich, piano; Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 338; CD and cassette. It's in just this sort of peripheral repertory, which requires first-rate performances to make it at all effective, that we've too often had to settle for well-meant mediocrity. Nothing of the sort here, as two supreme virtuosos, admirably supported by the conductorless Orpheus ensemble, throw their formidable artistic weight into impetuous, committed and compelling performances of two seldom-heard works Mendelssohn composed at ages 13 and 14. Even given such high-powered treatment, the Violin Concerto of 1822 cannot rival its famous E minor counterpart of 1844 in formal concision or lyrical refinement, but both youthful works emerge here as strong, vibrant creations, fully worthy of broader exposure in such top-flight performances. - James R. Oestreich Davis: 'The Silents: Musical Scores for Classic Silent Films' London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carl Davis. Virgin Classics 7 90785; CD and cassette. This music is the sort that makes the snobs shout ''derivative.'' Let them shout. They'll take nothing away from Carl Davis's gifts as a composer of memorable Hollywood music in the grand old tradition - eclectic but always expressive of the dramatic situation and handled with consummate flair. Sometimes Mr. Davis adapts existing music - Gottschalk tunes and traditional Chinese melodies for ''Broken Blossoms,'' hunks of ''Scheherazade'' for ''The Thief of Baghdad.'' But such original material as ''The Eagle of Destiny'' for ''Napoleon,'' the Garbo theme for ''Flesh and the Devil'' and the nightmarish Prokofievian cyclone music in ''The Wind'' stand securely on their own. The London Philharmonic plays well, and Virgin offers good sound. - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ Jefferson Airplane: 'Jefferson Airplane' Epic 45271; all three formats. Reunited after 17 years, the Jefferson Airplane still sounds like a collection of quarrelsome bohemians with eccentric interests. ''Summer of Love,'' Marty Balin's eulogy to the hippie dream, is the likeliest hit. Paul Kantner's ''Planes'' exalts the Freudian implications of air travel. Grace Slick's ''Panda'' pleads for the salvation of the species from extinction, and her ''Common Market Madrigal'' compares erotic love with European tourism. The portentous political anthem ''Solidarity'' lists Bertolt Brecht as one of its collaborators, and the mystical ''Wheel'' proclaims, ''From the heart of the volcano the future is born.'' With all its windy blather and quirkiness, the album sounds too fresh to seem a cynical cashing-in on nostalgia. - Stephen Holden Archie Brownlee and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi: 'You Done What the Doctor Couldn't Do' Gospel Jubilee RF-1402 (Down Home Records, 10341 San Pablo Ave., El Cerrito, Calif. 94530); LP only. The best tracks on this anthology, taken from 1948 through 1959, achieve the forward motion of a hurtling train, the deep intensity of the best art. Archie Brownlee, one of hard gospel's most influential singers, had a voice that could balloon at the end of a phrase, turn from velvet to crushed rock on a syllable. The group, which began at the Piney Woods School for blind children in Mississippi, cushions Mr. Brownlee's expeditions into passion with purring, organlike chords, occasionally backed by guitar and drums. But it's Mr. Brownlee's voice, gashing through the accompaniment, signifying a man caught up in the passion of belief, that makes these numbers work. - Peter Watrous 'Siya Hamba: 1950's South African Country and Small Town Sounds' Original Music OMA 111 (R. D. 1, Box 190, Lasher Road, Tivoli, N. Y. 12583); LP only. While recent commercial recordings from South Africa have lately been reaching the United States, ''Siya Hamba'' is a find - a glimpse into the urban and rural music of the 1950's. The urban music on side two shows how South Africans assimilated big-band pop and jump-blues; the music uses suave, jazzy harmony choruses behind powerful lead singers whose melodies still have traditional shapes. But the rural music on side one, recorded in the countryside, is the revelation. Using imported instruments like harmonica, concertina, autoharp or guitar in place of previous generations' traditional instruments, the music is raw, rhythmic and utterly joyous, with shouting, laughing audiences to prove it. - Jon Pareles Rhonda Clark: 'Between Friends' Tabu; all three formats. Ms. Clark has a pinched, tight voice that can get nasty, painted with touches of Dinah Washington or Esther Phillips's nasal tone. This is good, as her sound introduces a touch of reality into tunes heavy with ethereal synthesizer colors and distant, thumping bass lines. Recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis and partially produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (the movers behind Janet Jackson, among others), Ms. Clark's debut album has the producer's special sound, clean, full of puffs of music and overdubbed voices. When she improvises, screaming through the breaks in the production on ''The Way You Are,'' it's obvious she's something special. - P. W.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Try - try as hard as you can - not to think about a white bear, says Daniel M. Wegner, a professor of psychology at Trinity University in San Antonio, at the start of his book, ''White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts.'' He is betting that you will be unable to do it. Try as you might, he proposes, the thought of a white bear will push its way into your head just because you're trying not to think of it. This, in a nutshell, is what Mr. Wegner's book is about. He argues that trying to distract yourself is only useful if the distraction is compelling in itself, and that we cannot disbelieve an idea unless we have another idea to put in its place. I found Mr. Wegner's theses interesting, but his execution boring. Mr. Wegner repeats himself a bit too much to sustain attention, and in particular he slips in the white bear story so often that it seems almost a nervous tic. I became particularly impatient when he dwelled at length on concepts that seem self-evident. For example, he writes in a chapter on self-distraction that people can become absorbed in ''things that provide good exercise for their abilities.'' Then he goes on for three long paragraphs, expounding on this idea. His second paragraph on the subject starts by saying: ''The good tennis player who takes on someone of equal ability, for example, will usually become absorbed with the game. The child who has just learned to cut paper dolls, too, may well become engaged in the experience. Many people find this kind of engagement in their work - if it is a proper challenge for them. Even washing dishes can be absorbing and interesting if you find it to be a challenge that just matches your abilities.'' I'd rather think about a white bear.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Immediately below us on differing levels were other small walled gardens, one with a fountain, another a carp pool, the lowest the pretty castle swimming pool.

Passages of Christ's body were painted with angular, creamy brushstrokes that appeared to be lifting off the canvas. This separation made me see that in Manet's hands, paint was alive and purposeful before it was used to form an illusion. It seemed such a natural way of saying (something I'm sure I wanted to hear then) that paint dictates painting. I had to see more of the source of Manet's method - Velazquez, the 17th-century Spaniard he called the painter of painters.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Suddenly, the sidewalks are bordered with azure tiles and doused with the perfume of rotting mangoes; the streets are serenaded by thumping basso laments broadcast from souped-up Chevys; the advertisements appeal to a dozen loyalties and languages. Black-shawled Guatemalan women ply the restaurants, peddling red carnations, followed by packs of Vietnamese urchins toting bags of fresh-picked garlics; each available clapboard wall bursts with murals of naked Aztec deities and painted jungles; every sight conspires to defeat grayness and to sabotage the straight-and-narrow.

us,FICTION,"THE CURRENT CLIMATE. By Bruce Jay Friedman. (Morgan Entrekin/Atlantic Monthly Press, $18.95.) In his novel ''About Harry Towns,'' which was published 15 years ago, Bruce Jay Friedman presented a disturbing portrait of a hedonistic Manhattan playboy. The life of Harry Towns, a moderately successful screenwriter in his 40's, degenerates through episodes of drug abuse, disease-spreading sex and finally the molestation of his girlfriend's daughter. Filtered through Harry's myopic point of view, the novel offers occasionally harrowing glimpses into the temptations and excesses possible in a newly liberated age. ''The Current Climate,'' which takes Harry's life story both forward and back, offers less. The novel is neither realistic enough to be engaging as a story nor absurd enough to work as satire. Harry, now 58, has mellowed some but not much. Though he has a new wife and daughter and lives in a placid Long Island suburb, he remains addicted to indulgent Manhattan weekends of sex and drugs. Not as firmly rooted in a palpable time or place, and more prone to stereotype and contrived plot devices, these escapades lack the tension, and the relevance, of those in ''About Harry Towns.'' Mr. Friedman's writing, rife with choppy sentences and coarse language, is at times well suited to the simplistic mind of his protagonist, but such a voice is hardly sustainable over the course of a novel. To his credit, Mr. Friedman does try to step back and observe Harry and his environs in a more detached, sardonic manner than he did in the earlier novel. The intended humor occasionally works, but Mr. Friedman's look at the movie business and the rest of Harry's world lacks incisiveness. It remains inconsequential and flat.

us,NONFICTION,"NEW YORK. By Djuna Barnes. Edited by Alyce Barry. (Sun & Moon Press, Cloth $24.95, Paper $12.95.) To Djuna Barnes, author of the novels ''Ryder'' and ''Nightwood,'' New York could never be discovered in its demographics or statistics. ''The real Bronx has nothing to do with facts,'' she wrote, ''as the real Greenwich Village has nothing to do with facts, as no real good woman has anything to do with facts.'' Barnes's youthful journalism, written between 1913 and 1919 for such newspapers as The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, makes no claim to objectivity, which she called ''newspaper fiction.'' In search of adventure and subjects, she enters gorilla cages, volunteers to be rescued by firemen and, more painfully, undergoes force-feeding, to see if she had ''as much nerve as [ her ] English sisters,'' the feminists subjected to such treatment by British authorities. To the modernists the city was a site of dislocation, and Barnes traveled the length of New York to experience its unsettling effects. A favorite location was Coney Island, and the Coney Island of Barnes's mind was a frontier of novel behaviors set in a futuristic landscape of thrilling, giant machines that epitomized a changing society. In fact, Barnes's Coney Island became a trope for the danger and promise of the city itself. Her social commentary is vivid and idiosyncratic, marked by unusual images, empathy, irony and a complex class consciousness. What is fascinating about these essays, edited by Alyce Barry, a freelance editor, is their unique language and insights, which exist in tandem with some of the conventional wisdom of the day. Barnes's writing exemplifies an American avant-garde that was not ahead of its time on all counts, but was, rather, thoroughly of it, reveling and struggling in it.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Considering how badly he treated his lovers, Picasso's painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' with its twisted, tormented women, might have been a family portrait. Last year our reviewer, James R. Mellow, called this biography ''a lively and tendentious book.'' TWO AGAINST ONE, by Frederick Barthelme. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) During a surprise birthday visit from his estranged wife, Elise, Edward learns how much he truly loathes her. ''In its determination to pare away the layers of irony, casual self-deception and bravado that obscure the reality of modern marriage, 'Two Against One' is intermittently shocking and admirably brave,'' Francine Prose said in The Book Review last year. ''Unlike novels in which heroes with marital troubles still manage to have a rollicking good time, 'Two Against One' is so suffused with loneliness and angst that some sections . . . are almost unbearably painful to read.'' THE LIFE OF LANGSTON HUGHES. Volume II: 1941-1967. I Dream a World, by Arnold Rampersad. (Oxford University, $12.95) When the second volume of this biography of the poet laureate of black America was published last year, our reviewer, Rita Dove, praised ''the penetrating characterization and elegant analysis. . . . By tackling the thorny issues of race and politics whenever they impinged on Hughes's public and private ambitions, the author focuses an entire century through the lens of one exemplary life.'' THE CAPTAIN AND THE ENEMY, by Graham Greene. (Penguin, $7.95.) In the jungles of Central America, the narrator of this novel seeks the true identity of the mysterious stranger who, once long ago, spirited him away from a boarding school, claiming that he had won him in a backgammon game. Last year our reviewer, Brian Moore, said that ''in this short, skillful book we enter those disparate worlds Mr. Greene has made his own - the England of 'Brighton Rock' and 'The Ministry of Fear,' and the exotic Central American territories in which his restless talent has so often roamed.'' NOWHERE TO GO: The Tragic Odyssey of the Homeless Mentally Ill, by E. Fuller Torrey. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $8.95). Because of the country's failure to empty its asylums, E. Fuller Torrey writes, there are now more mentally ill people on the streets than in hospitals. At the same time, he says, psychiatrists concentrate on treating the ''worried well,'' who can afford to pay their bills. Last year our reviewer, Tamar Lewin, said she was unpersuaded by Dr. Fuller's argument for a return to involuntary commitment and forced treatment. But she said the book was ''an urgent call'' to make community mental health centers ''fulfill their original purpose.'' THE SILENCE IN THE GARDEN, by William Trevor. (Penguin, $7.95.) With the building of a bridge to the mainland, a wealthy Irish family finds the splendid isolation of its island kingdom invaded by the sordid realities of life. ''Mr. Trevor demonstrates the same sort of intimate knowledge of a place that Joyce displayed in 'Dubliners' and 'Ulysses,' '' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. HYPOCHONDRIA: Woeful Imaginings, by Susan Baur. (University of California, $9.95.) A psychologist tries to figure out why so many people make themselves sick by imagining that they are ill. ''The author's horrific case histories are relentlessly entertaining, and her interpretations ring true,'' Mike Oppenheim said here last year. THE MASKS OF ROME, by Caroline Llewellyn. (Ivy, $3.95.) A young Canadian art expert is the target of a murder plot after she uncovers a forgery. Last year our reviewer, Anne Whitehouse, called this first novel ''an adventure novel in the style of Daphne du Maurier and Mary Stewart.'' BROKEN ALLIANCE: The Turbulent Times Between Blacks and Jews in America, by Jonathan Kaufman. (Mentor/New American Library, $4.95.) During the civil rights movement, many blacks and Jews were united in what seemed a common cause. Interviewing people from both groups, a Boston Globe reporter asks why the alliance fell apart. ''The book's tone is that of a good novel in which human complexity tempers conflict,'' Shelby Steele said here last year. SILENCE IN HANOVER CLOSE, by Anne Perry. (Fawcett Crest, $3.95.) Inspector Thomas Pitt and his wife are joined by her recently widowed sister, who poses as a maid to solve a Victorian high society murder. Last year our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said ''the period detail in these stories always comes decorously draped around the solid bones of a good, gory crime.'' A HISTORY OF THEIR OWN: Women in Europe From Prehistory to the Present. Volume Two, by Bonnie S. Anderson and Judith P. Zinsser. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $12.95.) Two historians show that history looks very different when seen through the eyes of the women who lived it instead of the men. ''For a book that presents the big picture, this one is remarkably readable,'' Lynn Hunt said here last year. ''The young women, and young men, who read this history will find scores of examples to emulate.'' HEAVEN'S PRISONERS, by James Lee Burke. (Pocket Books, $3.95.) When a plane crashes in the bayou, a New Orleans ex-detective finds a secret survivor and clues to an underworld of drugs. ''There is a pronounced streak of poetry in Mr. Burke's prose,'' Newgate Callendar said last year in The Book Review.

us,THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE'S,"Beginning in 1801, when Greece was still part of the Ottoman Empire, the British Ambassador to Constantinople, the seventh Earl of Elgin, acquired from Turkish authorities much of the sculptural ornament of the Parthenon in Athens. Known as the Elgin Marbles, the sculptures are generally recognized as the most sublime expression of the Classical Greek style of the fifth century B.C. and are among the prized exhibits of the British Museum. They also remain an intrinsic part of the Parthenon, the great temple of Athena that has become an icon not only of Greek nationhood but of Western civilization. Since the removal, there have been passionate calls for their return to Greece by the Greek Government and others. Christopher Hitchens's IMPERIAL SPOILS: The Curious Case of the Elgin Marbles (Hill & Wang, $19.95) is both a history of the controversy and a plea for the return of the sculptures. A number of Lord Elgin's contemporaries - from Lord Byron to members of Parliament - opposed the acquisition on much the same grounds advanced by restitutionists today: that Turks had no right to allow Greek treasures to be carried off, that Lord Elgin overstepped even the authority given him by the Turks, that archeological remains are best appreciated in situ. Despite the title, Mr. Hitchens, a columnist for The Nation, treats the acquisition more as an ill-considered use of influence than as imperialistic looting, and he views any eventual return as an act of generosity. His account, full of colorful characters and written with wit, is entertaining as well as provocative.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Charles Mingus was one of the more tempestuous talents of jazz: a bassist, bandleader, composer and dynamo of creativity who never let up. Two of his friends wrote this recollection of his life and times. We should all have such friends. Mingus, whose outsized appetites and volatile temperament were as celebrated as his music, died in Mexico of the effects of Lou Gehrig's disease in 1979, at the age of 56. The writers Janet Coleman and Al Young had then known him for almost 20 years. They were young, idealistic English majors at the University of Michigan, habitues of the beatnik scene, when they met Mingus in the late 1950's. ''Mingus/Mingus'' is their story of the man and the musician and also a story of their own awakening in pre-Kennedy America - a time when, they make clear, jazz did not have the mainstream acclaim it enjoys today. The book examines Mingus in his creative fits and starts and is unabashed in its celebration of him. There are mixed tenses, anecdotes that wind their way haphazardly into others and disjointed leaps from memory to memory - and so what? While ''Mingus/ Mingus'' may have its narrative bumps and sharp curves, it rushes forward with the energy of a stand-up monologue and serves as a faithful mirror of one of modern music's more difficult personalities. ''Mingus/Mingus'' is a breezy but heartfelt tribute to an irascible talent, a collection as passionate and unruly as its subject. Until that definitive Mingus biography comes along, these remembrances - funny, respectful and revealing - will serve nicely.",1989-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Especially good on blocking pitches in dirt. Infielders(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 17Mark Grace 1b (.314, 13, 79) Made the top 10 in the National League in hitting for the second time in two years. Fine contact hitter with some power. Made only 17 errors as a rookie last season, only 6 this year. 23Ryne Sandberg 2b (.290, 30, 76) All-Star veteran closed the season with a record of 90 errorless games. Also a dangerous hitter. His 30 home runs were the most in 10 years for a second baseman in the big leagues. 11Luis Salazar 3b (.282, 9, 34) Arrived Aug. 31 in a trade from San Diego and immediately replaced the slumping Vance Law at third. Versatile athlete can play several positions. He hit over .300 for the Cubs and delivered three game-winning hits. 12Shawon Dunston ss (.278, 9, 60) Enjoyed the best season of his career. Cut errors down, learned to accept walks and not hack wildly. Best arm in the big leagues for an infielder. Outfielders(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 15Dwight Smith lf (.324, 9, 52) Arrived from the minor leagues on May 1 and stayed. Got his big chance when all three regular outfielders were injured. 20Jerome Walton cf (.293, 5, 46) Outruns infield hits and is also a good bunter and two-out hitter. Had a 30-game hitting streak during the season. 8Andre Dawson rf (.252, 21, 77) In his 14th season, five times an All-Star, the Hawk leads the way despite his bad knees. Bats either fourth or fifth with devastating power, and still has a rifle arm. Starting Pitchers(record, e.r.a.) 31Greg Maddux rh (19-12, 2.95) A 23-year-old star who made an impact last year when he won 15 games and lost 3 before the All-Star break. He will start the opening game. 36Mike Bielecki rh (18-7, 3.14) Discarded by Pittsburgh in spring training of 1988 and was traded to the Cubs for a minor league pitcher. Before this season, he had won 12 games in parts of 5 seasons. 40Rick Sutcliffe rh (16-11, 3.66) If his shoulder behaves, he will start the third game. Remains prime veteran with post-season credentials from the 1984 playoff, the year he won the Cy Young Award. 44Steve Wilson lh (6-4, 4.20, 2) Cubs are going with a three-man rotation, but he will start if Sutcliffe can't. Leaped to the big leagues from the Class AA level in a trade with Texas last winter. Relievers(record, e.r.a., saves) 28Mitch Williams lh (4-4, 2.76, 36) The Wild One who came in the Texas deal and immediately became a legend, striking out Mike Schmidt with the bases loaded on opening day. He is as advertised: a hard-throwing, flamboyant stopper. 50Les Lancaster rh (4-2, 1.36, 8) Works as a setup man for Williams or as a stopper. Generally more consistent and stable than Williams. 45Paul Assenmacher lh (3-4, 3.99) Arrived in late August in a trade from Atlanta and became valuable as a setup man for both Lancaster and Williams. 21Scott Sanderson rh (11-9, 3.94) Limited after back surgery last year. Most likely a middle reliever. Beat Giants twice as a starter this year. 39Paul Kilgus lh (6-10, 4.39, 2) Used as both a spot starter and in middle relief. Gives up hits, but survives. Reserves(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 2Vance Law 3b (.235, 7, 42) Experienced infielder who opened the season at third base but lost his everyday job to Salazar in August. He will be used as a right-handed pinch-hitter. 15Domingo Ramos if (.263, 1, 19) A fine pinch-hitter from the right side who delivered key hits all season. Also one of the best bunters on the team. 19Curtis Wilkerson if (.244, 1, 10) The fourth man in the Texas trade. He filled the need for a utility infielder. 10Lloyd McClendon of (.286, 12, 40) Came out of the farm system in May when all three starting outfielders were injured and hit a three-run homer in his first time at bat. 33Mitch Webster of (.257, 3, 19) He was the opening-day starter in left field, then strained his left leg on May 1 and never got the job back. He can play all three outfield spots, and can run and switch-hit. 25Marvell Wynne of (.243, 7, 39) A left-handed hitter who arrived in August from the Padres. Manager 4Don Zimmer At 58 years old, reaching new heights in a career that began as an infielder with the Dodgers. Like his friend, Roger Craig, he was one of the original Mets of 1962. Bold tactician who will squeeze a run home or put runners in motion with the bases loaded. San Francisco Giants Catchers(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 16Terry Kennedy (.239, 5, 34) Slow but experienced 10-year veteran of four clubs who played against the Cubs for the Padres in the 1984 playoff. A left-handed hitter who may start every game. 17Kirt Manwaring (.210, 0, 18) A right-handed batter and backup catcher with a reputation as an outstanding thrower (caught 41 percent of runners trying to steal). Infielders(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 22Will Clark 1b (.333, 23, 111) Rivaled Tony Gwynn for the batting title and finished in the highest brackets in hitting, r.b.i.'s and fielding. 6Robby Thompson 2b (.241, 13, 50) Made no errors in the first 50 games this year and only eight all season. He is also a versatile hitter who led the league in triples and stole 12 bases in 14 attempts. 9Matt Williams 3b (.202, 18, 50) Strikes out and hits home runs with great frequency. 23Jose Uribe ss (.221, 1, 30) Not much of a hitter, but tremendous in the field with range and a fine arm. Led the league in chances and double plays at shortstop. Hurt his shoulder on Sept. 23 and has played only once since. Outfielders(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 7Kevin Mitchell lf (.291, 47, 125 ) Played in the 1986 World Series for the Mets. Set a record for intentional walks for a right-handed hitter, led major leagues in home runs and runs batted in and is the ranking candidate for the most valuable player award in the National League. 2Brett Butler cf (.283, 4, 36) The catalyst in the Giants' attack. Missed only seven games, hits for a high average, stole 73 bases in the last two years and scored more than 200 runs. Covers center field with dash. 21Candy Maldonado rf (.217, 9, 41) A veteran of seven seasons with the Dodgers and the Giants, but he lapsed noticeably this year after opening as the regular right fielder. Now he platoons with Pat Sheridan. 25Pat Sheridan rf (.205, 3, 14) This is his debut season in the National League, and he's not hitting. Starting Pitchers(record, e.r.a.) 50Scott Garrelts rh (14-5, 2.28) He was a top reliever who became a top starter this season. Uses a split-fingered fastball that was taught and promoted by his manager. League bats only .212 against him. He will start the first game. 48Rick Reuschel rh (17-8, 2.94) Big Daddy got off to a flying start, went 6 and 0 in May with an 0.84 earned-run mark. Disabled in August by a groin injury, but came back to shine. 31Don Robinson rh (12-11, 3.43) Durable and experienced, a veteran of 12 years with the Pirates and the Giants. A former relief ace who now starts regularly. Strained his right knee, status questionable. 29Mike LaCoss rh (10-10, 3.17) Another of the team's senior citizens (32), pitched for Cincinnati, Houston and Kansas City before joining the Giants as a free agent in 1986. He was the bullpen stopper until Steve Bedrosian arrived in June. Relievers(record, e.r.a., saves) 40Steve Bedrosian rh (3-7, 2.87, 23) Throws heat and had a record of distinction with Atlanta and Philadelphia (Cy Young Award winner). He was traded to San Francisco on June 18 and saved 17 games since then. 49Jeff Brantley rh (7-1, 4.07) Serves as a setup man for Bedrosian. 37Kelly Downs rh (4-8, 4.79) Led the staff in shutouts for the last two years, but has been hurt most of this year since he injured his shoulder May 2. May get a start in this series. 14Atlee Hammaker lh (6-6, 3.76) Former starter, now a relief pitcher, has playoff experience. Injured several times this season and has worked only once recently. 28Bob Knepper lh (7-2, 5.13) Released by Houston on Aug. 5. Giants use him as a spot starter and in long relief. 32Craig Lefferts lh (2-4, 2.69, 20) Recorded the most saves for a season in his career. Pitched in the 1984 playoff against the Cubs. Reserves(average, home runs, r.b.i.) 19Bob Brenly c (.182, 0, 3) Started the year in Toronto, but was released in August and was signed by his former team. A backup catcher and a right-handed pinch-hitter. 30Donnell Nixon of (.265, 1, 15) Right-handed hitter who fills in sometimes for Mitchell in left field and for Butler in center, and for everybody in right. He can also run (10 for 13 stealing). 10Ken Oberkfell if (.269, 2, 17) Traded from Pittsburgh on May 10 after a long career as an infielder and left-handed hitter. Led the league with 18 pinch hits in 47 times at bat. 1Ernest Riles if (.278, 7, 40) Starts sometimes at third base and has some power. Manager 38Roger Craig At 59 years old, one of the game's successes after a career that began in 1955 as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Father of the split-fingered fastball, a longtime friend and colleague of Don Zimmer. Raises horses on his ranch outside San Diego.",1989-10-04T05:00:00+0000

A10 Noriega calling for a crackdown and the rooting out of traitors A10 White House to study handling of crisis A11 News analysis: Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany, has little to celebrate as his country marks its 40th anniversay today.

A1 A plan to open more U.S. cities to foreign airlines was announced by the Transportation Department. The proposed change is meant to increase competition in world aviation.

A cramped housing market led the couple to buy a 20-acre farm, which immediately evoked their enthusiasm for all things agrarian. Gardens were planted. Chickens, goats and two quarreling geese were brought on board. The book provides many amusing vignettes of city folk adapting to farm life. Yet there is a somber tone to all this. The reader is uncomfortably aware that this marriage is ill fated. Initially, the challenges of the farm united the couple; then, inevitably, accentuated their differences. Patricia Tichenor Westfall, a self-proclaimed pragmatist, labels her husband an impractical idealist. The reader, caught up in the battle, may pity Mark not only for his bumbling zealotry (he spent many hours digging deep, useless holes in the garden), but also for his being so severely reduced in dimension. In due course the couple separated, and Ms. Westfall, alone on the farm, became adept in the mysteries of plumbing and the felling of trees, leaving herself a few hours now and then to contemplate the nature of time and the symbolism of dreams. Ultimately Ms. Westfall, broke and unable to obtain a loan, was forced to sell the farm. But her experiences, described so vividly in this entertaining little book, gave her an enduring knowledge of her own strengths and limitations.",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

A Manhattan Civil Court judge ruled last week that the weeks Ms. Jennings spent living with the actor while he was filming ''The Big Chill'' (below) in South Carolina seven years ago did not constitute a legal marriage. Ms. Jennings's lawyer, Richard Golub, argued that Mr. Hurt and his client were common-law spouses under a South Carolina law. That would have entitled Ms. Jennings to a share of the actor's income. But Judge Jacqueline Silberman said they had not presented themselves as married and had not generally been viewed as such. The ruling did not affect Mr. Hurt's support payments - $65,000 a year - for the couple's 6-year-old son.

us,THE SHRINK ON THE COUCH,"Barbara Hey has some uneducated theories about psychotherapy (''The Shrink on the Couch,'' April 16). First of all, a good therapy depends as much on the patient as it does on the therapist. A brilliant therapist cannot ''cure'' a resistant patient, and a patient who wants to be cured more than anything else could probably do so with a less-than-brilliant therapist. Secondly, any good therapist will always answer questions honestly. If the question is a request for self-disclosure, the therapist is duty-bound to make sure his or her response will not affect the patient in a negative way. Thirdly, Freud did many things that Freudians now say are wrong to do, but it is the present-day Freudians who made up many of the rules, not Freud himself.

Information from the 20 volumes of ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' has been abstracted into bare-bones, succinct entries for this big one-volume reference book. Naturally there can be none of the detailed musicology that has gone into the parent volumes. But for those needing a handy book in order to look up something about music quickly without keeping an entire library on the shelves, ''The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music'' will take care of the situation. It is also a lovely printing job: good paper, legible type, intelligent layout. There are diagrams, drawings, tables and a few musical examples (see, for instance, the entries on intervals, key signature and note values). Leafing through the pages one can also find such unexpected entries as lindy, Minute Waltz - ''so called because it can be played (too fast) in one minute'' - and Kool Jazz Festival. The musical terms are given tersely, without frills: ''Diminished seventh chord. A chord consisting of three superimposed minor 3rds (e.g. B-D-F-A flat).'' The major composers each get three or four columns, in which their lives and works are boiled down in virtuoso examples of condensation. There are also abbreviated lists of their works, including dates of composition. The latest musicological findings are of course incorporated. In the Mozart listing there is none of the old sentimental nonsense about his poverty. ''He always earned, by musicians' standards, a good income, and had a carriage and servants; through lavish spending and poor management he suffered times of financial difficulty and had to borrow.'' The book has been scrupulously proofread. In the first edition of a volume of this scope, minor mistakes and typographical errors are bound to creep in. The editor, Stanley Sadie, a former critic for The Times of London, begs all readers who encounter errors to write in so that they can be eliminated from future editions. O.K. Here's one. Under the listing of Xaver Scharwenka, a piano concerto in A flat minor is mentioned. Aside from the fact that there is no such key as A flat minor, the concerto is in B flat minor (and correctly listed as such in ''New Grove'').",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Your strict lexicographer may question whether there is a real need for ''The Joys of Yinglish,'' the newest opus - one is tempted to say eppes - from the prolific Leo Rosten. Mr. Rosten's earlier lexicons, ''The Joys of Yiddish'' and ''Hooray for Yiddish,'' covered Mom-and-Pop Yiddish. This new one concentrates on pop Yiddish, the curious, perhaps even overwhelming, influence the language of the eastern European Jews has exerted on the modern version of the language of the Anglo-Saxons. Need-shmeed, it is a wonderful book. Mr. Rosten, who includes entries from his previous books, not only attests to words and usages that have entered the language (English, that is), but makes recommendations for those he thinks should be admitted. This is no cockamamie collection thrown together by a shlump, but a serious reference work by a maven. Serious? You should have a lifetime so serious. Each entry is accompanied by either an explanation or an illustrative joke (the jokes outnumber the exegeses), and even the ones you know come across lightly and brightly. This reviewer began making notes on passages that were particularly striking, but gave it up when he found he was copying the whole book. Among the expressions that have struck Mr. Rosten's eye and ear are ''Alice Island'' (the one the immigrants arrived at); ''bite your tongue''; farpatshket (''all messed up''); ''excuse the expression''; and, of course, oy. Mr. Rosten is a disarmingly amiable writer, a scholarly polemicist for his thesis. One wonders how English ever expressed itself before Yiddish arrived at the gates. As Will Shakespeare might have observed, ''Now you tell me?'' As you can see, ''The Joys of Yinglish'' is good merchandise. After all, McGraw-Hill is no schlock house.

In helping to discover how cells turn their genes on and off, generating the proper proteins, Francois Jacob learned that science was a ''constant dialogue between imagination and experiment that allowed one to form an increasingly fine-grained conception of what is called reality.'' Last year our reviewer, Peter Brooks, said that ''Mr. Jacob has written an autobiography that is not only literate but positively literary, shot through with reminiscences of classical French authors, skillfully plotted and elegantly written.'' THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED: Book Three of the Vampire Chronicles, by Anne Rice. (Ballantine, $5.95.) The mother vampire of them all awakens from a 6,000-year-old sleep with a plan to bring peace on earth by killing most of the men. Last year our reviewer, Eric Kraft, said Anne Rice is such a good writer that he wishes she would write about something other than bloodsuckers. ''She has a masterly way with language, works on a broad canvas, has a vast range of knowledge, brings exotic settings vividly to life and is wonderfully clever, but these gifts are wasted on vampires. May she find subjects worthy of her talents before these dead guys suck her dry.'' For people who are perfectly happy that Ms. Rice and a bewildering number of other authors have devoted themselves to this genre, Penguin has published THE PENGUIN BOOK OF VAMPIRE STORIES ($8.95). Edited by Alan Ryan, it includes 32 stories and annotated listings of vampire novels and movies. JUDAH P. BENJAMIN: The Jewish Confederate, by Eli N. Evans. (Free Press/Macmillan, $12.95.) Serving Jefferson Davis as Attorney General, Secretary of War and Secretary of State, Judah P. Benjamin has been called the Confederate Kissinger. Last year our reviewer, Arthur Hertzberg, said this fact-filled biography ''retells the story of Benjamin's career very well, and it tries hard to bring the private man to life.'' S., by John Updike. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) A woman named Sarah flees her upper-middle-class life in Boston and takes over a commune in Arizona. ''Mr. Updike is predictably dazzling in his mimicry of an intelligent, witty, articulate woman with the fullest possible storehouse of gripes and perceptions about the role of women in contemporary America,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ISRAEL'S FATEFUL HOUR, by Yehoshafat Harkabi. Translated by Lenn Schramm. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) A former intelligence adviser to several Prime Ministers argues that unless Israel gets out of the occupied territories and negotiates with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the country may destroy itself from within. The author's ''clearsightedness and toughness place him among Israel's pre-eminent soldier-scholars,'' David K. Shipler said here last year. ''This is very strong stuff, and the author delivers his verdicts in icy, merciless language.'' THE BIRTH DEARTH, by Ben J. Wattenberg. (Pharos, $11.95.) A senior fellow of the American Enterprise Institute worries that people like himself - civilized Westerners - are not having enough babies. ''There is something compelling about the rock-hard demographic facts that provide the basis of his speculation,'' Tamar Jacoby said here last year. But he has ''stretched and teased his genuinely unsettling message almost beyond what it can bear.'' SCENES FROM THE HOMEFRONT, by Sara Vogan. (Bantam, $7.95.) In one of these short stories a woman waiting for her husband to return from Central America falls in love with a Japanese crane she discovers in the backyard. ''If you love the National Geographic or Natural History magazine or the wildlife shows on PBS, you'll be entranced at how Ms. Vogan uses the intricacies of the natural world to bolster, inform, explore and create an external validation for the lives of her characters,'' Molly Peacock said here in 1987. STALAG LUFT III: The Secret Story, by Arthur A. Durand. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) An Air Force colonel pieces together the facts about daily life in the German prisoner-of-war camp that provided the inspiration for the movie ''The Great Escape.'' The story is ''ably detailed in graphic and gracious prose in this first-class book,'' David Murray said here last year. TWILIGHT, by Elie Wiesel. Translated by Marion Wiesel. (Warner, $9.95.) On a visit to a mental hospital in upstate New York, a Holocaust survivor and student of the kabbala finds madmen who are also prophets. Last year our reviewer, Stanley Moss, said, ''We accept Mr. Wiesel as Prospero the magician, even if at times he reminds us of a Jewish Polonius, because when his imagination really takes flight, and he takes on the role of a Jewish Ariel, we celebrate.'' CHILD STAR: An Autobiography, by Shirley Temple Black. (Warner, $5.95.) The actress who began her career at age 3 and retired at 22 tells her life story. Last year The Times's Aljean Harmetz said ''the book is candid, clear-eyed, a social history of Hollywood between the Depression and World War II, with an M-G-M producer, Arthur Freed, exposing himself to the 12-year-old Shirley at the same time his boss, L. B. Mayer, was pulling her mother down on his white couch.'' WESTERN SWING, by Tim Sandlin. (Ivy, $3.95.) A pulp novelist's search for transcendence is causing problems between him and his wife, a country-and-western singer named Lana Sue.

us,FICTION,"SNAKEWALK. By Charles Wheeler. (Harmony, $18.95.) When Patrick Todd is blinded in a boating accident, he takes his changed status in stride. He enrolls in a school for the blind and finds the physical adaptations surprisingly easy; warned that it might take two years to become proficient in Braille, he masters it in two weeks. First-time novelist Charles Wheeler (who was also blinded in a boating accident) has created in Patrick Todd an intriguing, if annoying, character. The somber tones sometimes associated with writing about a disability are completely absent here, and Patrick's irreverence is refreshing. Blind people, for example, are referred to as ''blinks''; sighted people are either ''regulars'' or ''eyeballs.'' Patrick's biggest difficulty is not his lack of sight but dealing with those eyeballs who specialize in condescension. His new friendships with other blind people also have built-in problems, however, which he faces only when he falls in love. ''She's blind, man,'' he tells himself, ''be honest with yourself and say it. You don't want to spend the rest of your life with a blind woman.'' Unfortunately, like all the characters in ''Snakewalk'' except for its narrator, that blind woman is a cipher. And Patrick Todd is mostly interested in Patrick Todd's pleasures. His decision to go to college is an unexplained move that doesn't square with his constant desire to practice mobility in the direction of the bar. Those bar scenes don't help spruce up the plot, but they're among the book's many hilarious interludes. ''Snakewalk'' is exceptional in its nonvisual use of language, its unexpected imagery (a bathroom, for example, is ''loud with disinfectant''). Charles Wheeler makes a good case for Patrick's argument that six months of blindness should be mandatory for sighted people, so they ''can get a good look at themselves.''",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

The building's richness came in part as a reaction to an earlier capitol building by Henry Ives Cobb, started in 1898, that legislators and the governor found so plain that they never allowed it to be finished, ordering work to a halt while they initiated an architectural competition for a grander building to be erected over and around it. Huston, the new architect, ended up spending $13 million as opposed to Cobb's $550,000, but that pleased state officials no more than Cobb's modesty had: the high cost of the building put the architect in the middle of a violent storm of controversy, and he was eventually jailed on charges of mishandling the job.",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT,"BAD INTENTIONS: The Mike Tyson Story. By Peter Heller (NAL Books, $18.95.) A biography of Mike Tyson should offer some insight into the heavyweight champion's effectively brutal behavior in the ring and puzzlingly erratic behavior outside it. It should, at least, provide some entertainment, as the tabloid headlines of the past couple of years are stitched into a juicy narrative. Unfortunately, ''Bad Intentions'' disappoints on both counts. The author, Peter Heller, a television sports producer, gives us 20 and 30 pages at a time of intricate background material - perhaps too intricate for all but boxing historians. Of Mr. Tyson's early days, we learn that he was called ''fairy boy'' in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn because of his soft, lisping voice and that he lovingly raised pigeons on a rooftop - shades of ''On the Waterfront.'' The most revealing episodes involve Cus D'Amato, who took Mike Tyson out of reform school, put him up in his house and taught him to box. Perhaps fearful that he would lose a future champion, D'Amato (who died in 1985) did not hold Mr. Tyson to house rules on discipline, letting him drop out of school before he was thrown out and getting legal custody. On the entertainment side, Mr. Heller gives us the whole delightful cast of characters: Mr. Tyson's former managers Bill Cayton and Jimmy Jacobs, who put together a successful and lucrative game plan for the fighter's career; Mr. Tyson's former wife, Robin Givens, and her mother, who while Mr. Tyson was at Jimmy Jacobs's funeral were at the fighter's brokerage house counting his money; the boxing promoter Don King, whispering in Robin's and Mike's ears to steal him away from Bill Cayton; even Donald Trump, out as usual to get his name in the papers (at their first meeting, Mr. Trump introduced himself and the fighter offered an expletive and walked away). But Mr. Heller's writing is awkward - ''but when it comes down to brass tacks, King plays hardball when cornered'' is a fair sample - and the story does not get the melodramatic spin that it needs to be as amusing as it has been on the 5 o'clock news.",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

''It's a feminine collection, for the sophisticated woman who likes to have fun with clothes.'' As for lengths, some are above the knee and some below.

Revised and expanded by Patricia Vickers Rich, Thomas Hewitt Rich and Mildred Adams Fenton. (Doubleday, $40.) ''Many a paleontologist has lived a long and useful life without seeing fossil flagellates, ciliates, or even radiolarians,'' write the authors of ''The Fossil Book.'' And not only paleontologists. But for anyone who would like to see them and find out what they are, this book is a good place to do it. Other creatures are covered, as well. Squids, for instance, had a tough start; they ''made slow progress for millions of years, and then became the most abundant of cephalopods.'' And good for them, I say. The tiny, toothy jaws of extinct worms (I didn't even know worms had jaws) are abundant fossils in some rocks. And giant, nasty birds once hunted and ate small horses on the plains of North America. In fact, ''The Fossil Book'' ranges with admirable thoroughness and clarity over all 3.5 billion years of living things and the remains they left. It describes what fossils are, how they are formed, found and studied. First published in 1958, the book has been reissued with some new sections. The volume contains many photographs and illustrations; among its attractions are numerous black-and-white drawings of invertebrates that are endlessly intriguing (I recommend the brachiopods). Some of the drawings of vertebrates, like the dinosaurs, are less exciting. The lithe, energetic dinosaurs of recent paleontological theory and speculation are not here, although the text does take note of current research and controversies. The book has been revised - by the retired geologist Mildred Adams Fenton; Patricia Vickers Rich, a lecturer in palentology at Monash University in Australia; and Thomas Hewitt Rich, curator of vertebrate palentology at the Museum of Victoria in Australia - for the nonscientist, albeit one who is willing to confront the lophophores, pedicles and condyles that always creep into this sort of discussion. Technical language, however, occurs mostly in discussions of particular animals and is made clear in the text and drawings. (There is also a glossary.) Furthermore, the book is not without drama and pathos, as befits a book on which death weighs so heavily. I found particularly poignant the fate of certain lungfish called Gnathorhiza, from the Permian. These are fish that left the water and spent the dry season in burrows. And that is where their fossils were found, 250 million years later, still waiting for the rains.",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Its order and its complexities have invited, even demanded, statistics for more than a century. ''Total Baseball'' is one of the best baseball statistics books ever. It uses the traditional statistics, accumulated though painstaking research (Ty Cobb had 4,190 hits, not 4,191), as well as new ones: the so-called sabermetrics popularized by Bill James and by John Thorn and Pete Palmer in their book, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball,'' to rate players of different eras by adjustments that reflect how the game has changed. Their computer base goes back into the last century, and using the Thorn-Palmer scheme of Linear Weights (best defined in the book, not in a short review) they determine that the best single season by a pitcher was Silver King's in 1888 with the St. Louis Browns, when he had 45 wins, 21 losses and a 1.64 e.r.a. Similarly, their numbers maintain that the 10 all-time best careers ever were those of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron,Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Nap Lajoie, Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker and Mike Schmidt. Pick your statistic, traditional or newfangled, and look at the records of 13,000 players. Don't be put off by the 2,294 pages; the first 678 are essays, mostly forgettable.

Offering its heroine one of the best opportunities for wish fulfillment this side of ''Cinderella,'' Mike Nichols's film ''derives a lot of its charm from the performance of Melanie Griffith, the baby-voiced bombshell who gives Tess an unbeatable mixture of street smarts, business sense and sex appeal.'' Sigourney Weaver and Joan Cusack offer memorable performances, but Harrison Ford plays a kind of all-purpose generic male. ''Enjoyable even when it isn't credible, which is most of the time,'' this film, like its heroine, ''has a genius for getting by on pure charm.'' (Janet Maslin) Major League 1989. Paramount Home Video. No list price. LD, $24.95. 1:47. CC. R. Though cast close to type, Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen and Bob Uecker give quirky performances in David Ward's loopy film about movie baseball, which is ''even goofier than baseball as we know it.'' Until the last half-hour, when it goes soft and ''heads for that never-never land of movie baseball, where the obligatory big game and the slow-motion shot of the last play are waiting,'' this spoof is ''wonderfully unpretentious, uningratiating and uninspiring.'' (Caryn James) The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie 1969. CBS/Fox. $79.98. 1:56. CC. PG. Based on a novel by Muriel Spark and a play by Jay Presson Allen, this tale of an unconventional Scottish schoolteacher teetering between a basic common sense and a delicate paranoia, makes ''a very decent movie, but it will probably be underrated because it must seem smaller than the big, extraordinary performance that Maggie Smith gives.'' The director, Ronald Neame, has cast the movie superbly, with Robert Stephens, Pamela Franklin and others. (Vincent Canby) The Choirboys 1977. MCA Home Video. $79.95. 2:00. R. Based more or less on a best-selling novel by Joseph Wambaugh, which came alive with ''a forlorn truth,'' Robert Aldrich's movie ''is cheap and nasty without having any redeeming vulgarity and absolutely no conviction of truth.'' Charles Durning, Perry King, Tim McIntire, Randy Quaid and Burt Young turn in intermittently entertaining performances as Los Angeles cops of assorted eccentricities needing to unwind. ''A stylistic and narrative mess.'' (Canby) Bedtime Story 1964. MCA. $59.95. 1:39. Not rated. Marlon Brando is ''full of surprises,'' a critic wrote at the time. Departing from his usual style, Brando plays ''a ring-a-ding comedy character'' - ''a low-down conniver, a sweet-talking, free-wheeling fraud,'' the counterpart of Steve Martin's role in last year's remake of the film, ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' David Niven creates the role of the suave con man, later portrayed by Michael Caine, and Shirley Jones gives a ''sweet'' performance. ''Mark this one down as good, crisp fun.'' A Summer Story 1988. Media Home Entertainment. $79.95. 1:37. PG-13. Adapted by Penelope Mortimer from a John Galsworthy story and directed by Piers Haggard, this is ''a relentlessly pretty film'' that's no more tough-minded than its lead character. ''It could be described as pure hokum if the characters spoke that way, but they don't.'' The stars, Imogen Stubbs, James Wilby and Susannah York, don't so much act as glow. The ending is calculated to require four hankies. (Maslin) Let's Dance 1950. Paramount. $14.95. 1:52. Not rated. The title is appropriate to this Fred Astaire vehicle, according to a contemporary critic, and when the star ''turns his legs to dancing, the new musical . . . whirls as gracefully as a fast spinning top. But when Mr. Astaire steps back into the role of actor and the story takes over, the momentum slackens noticeably and [ the film ] becomes a wobbly entertainment.''

The death of the protagonist in too many modern novels leaves the reader merely eager to move on to the next book, but by the time Stanislas Beren departs from Michel Deon's ''Where Are You Dying Tonight?'' we have learned (and come to admire) so much about him that his end provokes real regret. In this highly literate novel, the French author's first work to be published in English, a young man of unknown origins arrives at a ''rather snobbish lycee'' in Paris, is taken up and ''civilized'' by a fellow student's well-to-do family and eventually becomes a celebrated novelist. The story, which begins in 1925 and ends in 1977, is a delicious merging of narrative passages with excerpts from Stanislas' writings (footnotes included) and flashbacks to the events of his life that inspired those writings, not to mention numerous references to actual books, poems, paintings and people. Stanislas marries his best friend's aunt Felicite, with whom for nearly 40 years he enjoys a perfectly complicitous understanding and mutual respect, although he has many liaisons and a couple of great loves along the way. The novel's citations of authors from Rimbaud to Maugham, descriptive phrases about paintings by artists from Giorgione to Picasso and mentions of real people from the period in which the book takes place are not only fun but also make one want to follow the Berens' trail through London and Paris to the art museums and trattorias of Venice.

By day, Harrods teems with life, offering to the 50,000 customers who pass through its doors daily roughly 20 acres of selling space, spread over five floors and 300 departments that include everything from $400,000 necklaces to 50-cent handkerchiefs.",1989-10-08T05:00:00+0000

The standard treatment for such tumors was an extensive operation that involved removing the entire larynx, or voice box. Even with a total laryngectomy, his chance of being cured was less than 20 percent. Pfeiffer, who had spent 30 years as a broadcast journalist for CBS and the United Nations, accepted the news of the tumor as a challenge to be overcome, but the talk of laryngectomy terrified him.

President Reagan's exact response was, ''Not to my knowledge.'' During the pay wars in Congress last January, I quoted an unnamed Senator as saying, ''If we in the Congress must maintain a higher standard of morality without a higher salary, where is the incentive? If we must spend all day long being ethical, how can we do our jobs?'' The quote was pure invention, but inasmuch as it was completely believable no one questioned it.

That clinched the cup, but Pam Shriver and Zina Garrison completed a 3-0 sweep, beating Martinez and Sanchez Vicario, 7-5, 6-1, in doubles.

A.Vinyl siding does not offer any additional insulation, although it may offer added resistance to infiltration of cold air. And, of course, vinyl requires little or no maintenance.

us,BALL PARKS FIGURES,"OAKLAND COLISEUM Built: 1966 Seating capacity: 48,219 on three tiers. Outfield distances: Left-field foul line: 330 ft. Left-field power alley: 375 ft. Center field: 400 ft. Right-field power alley: 375 ft. Right-field foul line: 330 ft. Outfield walls: Plywood covered with canvas 8 feet high. Field: Grass that is not quite as high as Candlestick's. Weather: Much less wind than at Candlestick but a heavy atmosphere. The ball does not carry well at night. Home dugout and bullpen: Third-base side. Unusual field feature: Because of the oval shape of the multipurpose stadium, the field has one of the largest foul areas in the major leagues, which is bad news for hitters. Scoreboard: Old-fashioned type in which numbers and names are posted by hand. There is, however, a giant television for replays, notices and advertising. Fun: In a fantasy broadcasting booth, you can broadcast an inning of the game and take home your tape. Also, you can try a pitching machine that measures the speed of your throws, or get your photo taken alongside life-size cutouts of the team's stars. The giant replay screen features dot racing - dots of different colors move around a track and fans bet one another on which dot is going to win. Food: Very big on sausages - bratwurst, kielbasa, Louisiana hots, Polish and English bangers. They also have super nachos, with an inordinate amount of condiment fixings, and a large selection of beer. One cafeteria-type restaurant. Access: BART, the subway system, has a station right at the Coliseum. For those who drive, a major freeway runs right alongside with an entrance and exit serving the Coliseum. Luxury boxes: On press-box level along both foul lines. Boxes seat about a dozen and have a bar and television screen in the back. CANDLESTICK PARK Built: 1960 Seating capacity: 60,000 on two main tiers with a mezzanine between. Outfield distances: Left-field foul line: 355 ft. Left-field power alley: 365 ft. Center field: 400 ft. Right-field power alley: 365 ft. Right-field foul line: 355 ft. Outfield walls: Wire fence 9 feet high. Field: Grass that is particularly high and soft. Weather: Although the wind is not so strong as it is during midsummer, it swirls unpredictably. Flags only a few feet apart can fly in opposite directions. Home dugout and bullpen: First-base side. Unusual field feature: Behind the Giants' bullpen there is a little shed in which the relief pitchers can stay warm. It has a door that faces home plate. This season, a ball hit fair bounded into the open door, which Craig Lefferts then closed, leaving his own teammate in right field bewildered and searching for the ball. The play was a grounds-rule double. No shed for the visiting team; also no access to clubhouses from visiting bullpen or dugout. Scoreboard: Modern, electronic with Jumbotron - a hugh television screen for information and replays. Fun: You can have a videotape made of yourself hitting a home run to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. Also, you can try a pitching machine that measures the speed of your throws, or get your photo taken alongside life-size cutouts of the team's stars. Between innings, the scoreboard shows the names of three songs, and fans vote by applause and shouts which one they want played. Food: Cuisine features health foods like trail mix and vegetarian hot dogs along with regular hot dogs and Polish sausages. Beverages include Anchor Steam beer and wine. There is an upscale Stadium Club restaurant and a cafeteria. Access: Very poor for cars because of a hill blocking one side and water blocking the other. No train or subway or trolley or bus routes go to the ball park or to any place close enough to walk from. Public transportation includes special city buses that run from set locations and a few from the suburbs. Luxury boxes: Less luxurious than most luxury boxes are, but have been rebuilt in the last three or four years more to suit the football customers than the baseball customers. They have about 12 seats and a bar area with a television set in the back.",1989-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Huberts (July 15, 1988), 575 Park Avenue (entrance on 63d Street), 826-5911 - Soft-edged and Japanese-inspired, the dining room at Huberts is designed for comfort and conversation. The owners' fondness for Japanese esthetics and cuisine is evident in some of the dishes, like the starter of bright shrimp salad embellished with daikon and cucumber. Main courses include include breast of duck salad; Saudi clove chicken (chicken sauteed with fragrant spices); and rack of lamb with tomato-cucumber-mint salad. Lunch is a four-course tasting menu at $34 or a la carte (appetizers $6 to $11, entrees $12 to $18). Dinner is a $45 tasting menu or a la carte (appetizers $8 to $16, entrees $19 to $28). Lunch: noon to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner, 6 to 10:30 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Le Perigord (June 16, 1989), 405 East 52d Street (755-6244) - The 25-year-old Perigord offers classic French cooking, opulent but light and herb-infused; its service staff is among the best in New York. In the dining room, soft lighting and bursts of fresh flowers surround patrons with elegance. Recommended appetizers include a salmon and onion tart and tartar of fresh salmon. Pasta with smoked salmon and shrimp is another example of the chef's talent. For main courses, consider skate with aioli and red cabbage; salmon steak with clams and spinach, and roast duck with seasonal fruits. Lunch is prix fixe at $28 (with some supplements); dinner $48. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Monday to Saturday. The Sign of the Dove (March 27, 1987), 1110 Third Avenue, at 65th Street (861-8080) - The food is as seductive as the setting at Sign of the Dove, where brilliant flower arrangements decorate the dining rooms.

Albumin: A protein manufactured by the liver. Changes in level may be linked to liver disease or poor diet. Calcium: A mineral in blood that comes from bones. Loss of bone tissue can increase levels. Kidney disease and lack of vitamin D can lower levels. Cholesterol: A blood fat tied to eating animal fats. High levels are linked to disturbances of fat metabolism. Clotting factors: Low levels indicate bleeding disorders, like hemophilia. Globulin: Similar to albumin, but contains antibodies. Fluctuations in levels are common. Extreme levels can indicate disease. Glucose: High levels could indicate diabetes. Hemoglobin and iron: Low counts indicate anemia. Triglycerides: Blood fats related more to total calories and starch in diet than to fats. High levels can lead to hardening of the arteries.

When the early post-modernists used a column, for example, their version was often overscaled and decorative, sometimes even flattened onto a wall; now, a post-modern architect would be inclined to design a column with more sensible proportions and use it as a structural support. As the decade comes to a close, post-modernists are still borrowing from the past, but in more subtle ways. And their message is clear: The joke is over.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Despite persistent rumors that she felt ill-treated by the hiring of Ms. Norville, Ms. Pauley insisted that the move to a new NBC show after 13 years of ''Today'' was a plus.

us,New & Noteworthy,"LITTLE ODESSA, by Joseph Koenig. (Ballantine, $3.95.) A Times Square stripper from Brooklyn's Russian emigre community is recruited by the F.B.I. for an investigation that climaxes with a Coney Island roller-coaster ride. This is ''a highly readable, beautifully written book,'' Newgate Callendar said here in 1988. BLIND FAITH, by Joe McGinniss. (Signet/New American Library, $5.95.) Rob Marshall, a wealthy New Jersey suburbanite, arranges to have his wife, Maria, shot to death during a faked robbery. Earlier this year our reviewer, Anne Rice, said this true crime story ''offers suspenseful and engrossing reading, with a courtroom drama that is cathartic as well as gripping. . . . Rob Marshall emerges as a monster by anyone's standards, a deeply flawed and subsequently dangerous individual who was apparently incapable of realizing on any moral level what the murder of his wife really meant.'' Signet has also published a new edition of FATAL VISION ($5.95), Mr. McGinniss's story of Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret physician convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two children in 1970 and blaming drug-crazed hippies for the crime. In a new epilogue the author rebuts a New Yorker article published this year in which Janet Malcolm accused him of tricking Mr. MacDonald into thinking the book would exonerate him. ''Even though the doctor's ulterior motive was clearly to use [ the ] friendship for the purpose of proving his innocence, there are bound to be those readers who feel that Mr. McGinniss has exploited and betrayed a friendship,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times in 1983. ''But 'Fatal Vision' smells of integrity, and that's one of the many things about it that make it irresistible.'' Also available from New American Library is a new edition of GOING TO EXTREMES ($8.95), Mr. McGinniss's 1980 book about Alaska. SOMETHING IN THE AIR, by Emma Lathen. (Pocket Books, $3.95.) The executive vice president of an investment company wonders who killed an outspoken employee of a small airline trying to close a big financial deal. ''I've never been a big mystery fan,'' our reviewer, Wendy Wasserstein, said last year. But Emma Lathen, a pseudonym shared by Mary Jane Latsis, an economist, and Martha Henissart, a lawyer, ''spins an observant tale of financial and criminal intrigue.'' PUZZLE FOR PLAYERS, by Patrick Quentin. (International Polygonics, $5.95.) Preparations for a play called ''Troubled Waters'' are interrupted by a series of mysterious deaths. In 1938, our reviewer, Isaac Anderson, said the ''baffling mystery . . . presents a vivid picture of a play being built in rehearsal and of the problems faced by the author, the producer and the members of the cast.'' Patrick Quentin was a pen name shared by Hugh Callingham Wheeler, who wrote ''Sweeney Todd,'' and Richard Wilson Webb. DEATH TAKES THE STAGE, by Donald Ward. (St. Martin's, $7.95.) This murder mystery takes place in the kinkier strata of Los Angeles's theater community, and the sleuth is a Hollywood agent. ''There are indications that Mr. Ward, to whom nothing seems holy, is kidding around with the private-eye genre,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''Have a ball. A fresh new talent has arrived.'' AT DEATH'S DOOR, by Robert Barnard. (Dell, $3.95.) A West End actress arrives at her former lover's home in a small English village to put a stop to a tell-all biography being written by the illegitimate daughter produced by the affair. Last year The Times's John Gross said that ''Mr. Barnard resolves the mystery with practiced ingenuity, rousing suspicions, confirming some of them, deflecting others, making you wonder whether there isn't a second riddle wrapped in the original enigma.'' THE SPY WHO GOT AWAY: The True Story of the Only CIA Agent to Defect to the Soviet Union, by David Wise. (Avon, $4.95.) With the help of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. mishandled an embittered former agent named Edward Lee Howard who fled to Moscow with agency secrets. This account leaves you ''first in helpless laughter - and finally, it has to be said, in helpless rage at the arrogance and apparent incompetence of our homegrown spymasters and counterintelligence wizards,'' Peter Maas said in The Book Review in 1988. GENERAL MURDERS, by Loren D. Estleman. (Fawcett Crest, $3.95.) Earlier this year our reviewer, Edna Stumpf, said the best of this collection of Amos Walker murder stories is ''The Prettiest Dead Girl in Detroit.'' The author's ''genius seems to reside in his devotion: he slavishly imitates Raymond Chandler and handles the inherent sentimentality of his enterprise with becoming reticence.'' SPRING HARROWING, by Phoebe Atwood Taylor. (Foul Play Press/Countryman, $5.95.) On Cape Cod a man is found clawed to death after his neighbor's two bobcats are set free. ''You will have a mighty good time reading the story, although there will be moments when you may fear that you are going mad,'' Isaac Anderson said in these pages in 1939. Foul Play Press has reissued another mystery featuring the sleuth Asey Mayo, THE DEADLY SUNSHADE ($5.95), published in 1940, in which the victim is found dead beneath her beach umbrella. THE THIRD GENERATION, by Chester Himes. (Thunder's Mouth, $11.95.) The writer who made his mark with ''Cotton Comes to Harlem'' and other novels about crime in far northwest Manhattan called this ''my autobiographical novel.'' In 1954 our reviewer, John Brooks, said the searing story of a black professor whose wife tries to pass for white ''shows how increasingly firm a position he deserves among American novelists.''",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

In her 18th novel featuring Detective Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbett, the veteran mystery writer Patricia Moyes moves her urban hero from the dreariness of winter in London to the decidedly sunnier island of Tampica, the languid, imaginary Caribbean paradise that also served as the setting for her 1977 novel, ''The Coconut Killings.'' Posing as ''refugees from the English weather'' who are ''rich and stupid, as well as conventional and snobbish,'' Henry and Emmy, his partner in sleuthing as well as marriage, attempt to help their old friend Lucy Pontefract-Deacon, an elderly eccentric who claims her life is being threatened by a Government-sponsored cocaine ring. Meticulous and savvy as ever, Henry soon suspects that some of his own colleagues are involved in certain shipping operations on the island (so ''very conveniently situated'' between South America and the United States) and that his survival depends on trusting no one. In addition to masquerading as a drug-runner himself, he must (horror of horrors) actually lie to Emmy. As for Emmy, she must resort at one point to offering cocaine (the ''white girl'' of the title) as a bribe. In ''Black Girl, White Girl,'' Ms. Moyes handles these indecorous events with her usual decorum; that is, with a minimum of violence and fuss. One of the deftest practitioners of the British procedural detective novel, she somehow manages to make drug dealing seem more like bad manners than bad morals.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

To see such traditional merchandise is not unusual at High Point, the largest wholesale furniture market in the country. In fact, manufacturers at this twice-yearly show have always relied on easy-to-live-with designs for their bread and butter. But at this fall's show, which opens on Thursday and runs through Oct. 27, many new designs are additions to successful lines introduced last year. Others have been conceived as affordable answers to the rising cost of these popular antiques. ''Russian furniture is so hot right now, and we felt there were serious voids in our Russian line,'' says Todd Sessa, a sales and marketing executive for John Widdicomb. As a result, Widdicomb is introducing such objects as a console, a cocktail table and a demilune door cabinet to its existing collection. Thayer Coggin is also riding on a successful year-old line. Milo Baughman, the company's designer, has created 18 new pieces for a Biedermeier '90 collection.

us,NONFICTION,"ROEMER: Man Against the Mob. By William F. Roemer Jr. (Donald I. Fine, $19.95.) Of his many awards and commendations, the former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent William F. Roemer Jr. writes that ''the best testament'' came from the organized-crime boss Jackie Cerone, who crowned Mr. Roemer ''the nemesis of Chicago organized crime.'' In his autobiography, ''Roemer: Man Against the Mob,'' the author details his unparalleled success from the 1950's through the 1970's at infiltrating Chicago's underworld and prosecuting its members. Mr. Roemer writes that he came to have ''grudging respect'' for such mob figures as the one-time Capone enforcer Anthony (Big Tuna) Accardo and Murray (The Camel) Humphreys. Others, such as Sam Giancana, Mad Sam DeStefano, Felix (Milwaukee Phil) Alderisio and Tony (The Ant) Spilotro earned nothing but Mr. Roemer's contempt. No matter what his feelings, the author stalked them with equal dedication. Mr. Roemer, now a private consultant on organized crime, used wiretaps (before President Lyndon B. Johnson pulled the plug on them in 1965) and, later, informants to gain information on mob figures. Then he would use what he'd learned either ''to prevent their plans from bearing fruit'' or to prosecute them. Throughout it all, Mr. Roemer writes that he loved his role as nemesis and that certain of his adversaries ''gave me great adventure as I tracked them and fought them, and my prayers are with them in spite of them.'' Although the reader may have some problems following the chronology - perhaps inevitably, given the author's episodic style - Mr. Roemer does an admirable job of bluntly recreating the inner workings of Chicago's underworld and the F.B.I.'s methods of fighting them. ''Roemer: Man Against the Mob'' is a revealing, refreshingly sincere memoir that pulls no punches in recalling the triumphs - and, at times, foul-ups - that characterized Mr. Roemer's remarkable career.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Every parent's nightmare became reality for a family in St. Joseph, Mo., in 1978. Their 4-year-old son disappeared from a shopping mall and was found murdered hours later. An innocent retarded man went to prison, writes Terry Ganey in ''St. Joseph's Children,'' while the real murderer, Charlie Hatcher, continued his travels, killing whenever the urge grew too strong to resist. Mr. Hatcher, intelligent but poorly educated, had learned from long experience how to manipulate the criminal justice system. In San Francisco he was caught in the act of sodomizing and strangling a 5-year-old boy. Faking a semicatatonic state, he persuaded psychiatrists he should be treated, not punished; then he faked a recovery and all too soon was back on the streets. The insanity ploy continued to protect him in state after state. Whenever he was caught trying to abduct a child, Hatcher would do his routine, be sent to a mental hospital, held a few months, then released. Finally, in 1982, Hatcher returned to St. Joseph, where he found his 16th murder victim. He found her near the same mall. He was caught, but only, Mr. Ganey says, because some part of him was tired of it all and needed to confess. ''St. Joseph's Children'' offers a well-researched recitation of Hatcher's monstrous crimes, but little beyond that. It is as if Mr. Ganey, a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, could not bear to look too deeply into his subject. Still, it is a powerfully affecting story, made even more so by the estimation of some authorities that at any one time there are at least 35 serial killers roaming the United States. From the evidence presented here, there is little protection between our children and the urges of these criminals.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Bach: Lute Suites (BWV 995-97, 1006a) Sharon Isbin, guitar. Virgin Classics VC 7 90717-2; CD and cassette. Sharon Isbin collaborated with the harpsichordist Rosalyn Tureck on the new editions of the four suites heard here, and she plays the music with authority. Immediately striking are the clarity of her articulation and voicing, and her dramatic, high-contrast approach to dynamics and coloration. She plays sarabandes and other slow movements with a soft touch and rhythmic restraint; the fast dances throw off sparks in every direction. Miss Isbin's ornamentation - light initially, florid in repeats - will seem mannered to some, but is often inventive and virtuosic, generally a fine, distinguishing touch. To accommodate this ornamental impulse, she takes all the repeats, making for a generously packed disk (78:47). - Allan Kozinn Schnittke: 'Faust Cantata,' Three Orchestral Works Malmo Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (with soloists, in ''Faust'') conducted by James DePreist (''Faust'') and Leif Segerstam. Bis CD-437; CD only. The Russian composer Alfred Schnittke calls himself a polystylist, so one should probably be ready for anything. Still, it comes as a shock when Mephistopheles bloodies up Faust so violently, accompanied by a grotesque tango. And the tango seems all the more ghoulish, since it follows about 15 minutes of ordinary, faceless avant-garde expressionism. Ultimately Schnittke's livid cantata is hard to take entirely seriously, but it contains wonderfully hair-raising music and is a promising sketch for his proposed Faust opera. The disk also contains three intense orchestral works: ''Ritual,'' Passacaglia and, the best, the wacky Mozartean Nightmare ''(K)ein Sommernachtstraum'' - ''(Not) a Midsummer Night's Dream.'' The performances and sonics are bold and impressive. Great stuff for Halloween. - Mark Swed Bruckner: Symphony No. 8 Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Deutsche Grammophon 427 611; two CD's only. This comes as consolation to one who missed the performance of the work these artists gave in Carnegie Hall last February. Always an eloquent Brucknerian (a Seventh Symphony is still to come from DG), Karajan managed to summon the needed mystic sense and sonorous haze while sacrificing little in orchestral precision. Here the lapses in ensemble - enough to suggest a live recording, which this is not - count for little against the imposing grandeur of the conception. As Karajan's iron grip on orchestral execution faltered in recent years, it gave way to a new level of soulful intensity. Alongside the Mahler Ninth he recorded with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1982, this will stand as one of the great valedictory statements of his extraordinary final decade. - James R. Oestreich Carter: Vocal Works Christine Schadeberg, soprano; Katherine Ciesinski, mezzo; Jon Garrison, tenor; Patrick Mason, baritone; Jan Opalach, bass; Speculum Musicae. Bridge BCD 9014; CD only. Elliott Carter's vocal works are often thought the most unlovable music of an unlovable, if significant, composer. Carter sets difficult poets - Elisabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and Robert Lowell - and never expects them to fit their multilayered poems within the constraints of single-level melody. Instead, he brings the poetry to life on its own terms. And since life is not easily led or understood, neither is Carter's unpredicatble and exceptional music. Contrived to work the way the brain does, it juggles many conflicting thoughts and feelings at once. Taken together, ''A Mirror on Which to Dwell'' (1976), ''Syringa'' (1978) and ''In Sleep, in Thunder'' (1982) form a triptych on modern love and madness, with Carter's music probing the poets' elusive feelings, dramatizing them and, yes, actually making them more accessible. The scores have been well recorded before, but never have they been presented together or made to sound so vivid and musical. - M. S. POP/JAZZ Elton John: 'Sleeping With the Past' MCA 6321; all three formats. The past to which the title of Mr. John's newest album refers is the American pop-soul music of the late 50's and early 60's that profoundly influenced his style. While not overtly imitating vintage pop-soul hits, Mr. John and his longtime lyrics partner Bernie Taupin pack their latest bunch of songs with allusions to black American gospel music. ''Healing Hands,'' ''Club at the End of the Street'' (which suggests a less frenzied ''Philadelphia Freedom''), the rockabilly-flavored ''Stone's Throw From Hurtin','' and ''Amazes Me,'' an imagined Mississippi idyll, are the most evocative cuts. As usual, the lyrics are vague glosses of stories and don't really add up to anything. But Mr. John's vocal exuberance, buoyed by the light, streamlined arrangements, maintains a pleasant, percolating verve. - Stephen Holden Randy Travis: 'No Holdin' Back' Warner Bros. 25988-2; all three formats. The frozen, almost unreal production of the album belies Mr. Travis's reputation as a new traditionalist in country music. The images - gamblers, singing the blues, an old man who was ''90 years old in 63,'' love and more, tortured, love - all point in the direction of country honky-tonk. But the music, slow and polite, with restrained choral backing, points out that Mr. Travis is retreating from the straightforward music with which he made his reputation. Instead of offering the crisp simplicity of a live performance, ''No Holdin' Back'' has moments of Nashvillian upscale insincerity, all baritone emotionality and rainstorms of mock teardrops. - Peter Watrous The Innocence Mission: 'The Innocence Mission' A & M 5274; all three formats. The quivering angelic voice of Karen Peris, a singer, songwriter and keyboardist who is the center of The Innocence Mission, a rock quartet from Lancaster, Pa., suggests a hybrid of Stevie Nicks and Kate Bush. Her fervent vocal sensitivity complements original folk-rock songs that portray everyday feelings and observations as near-miraculous happenings. Delicate chiming guitar and keyboard textures and circular chantlike melodies underscore lyrics whose subjects range from wondering what kind of person a brother's fiancee will turn out to be (''Curious'') to entranced meditations on the afterlife (''Mercy,'' ''Wonder of Birds''). This debut, produced by the rock bassist Larry Klein, is filled with promise. - S. H. Erskine Hawkins and His Orchestra: 'The Original Tuxedo Junction' RCA 9682-2-RV (recorded 1938-45); all three formats. Adored by the dancers at the Savoy Ballroom, the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra never had much of a following outside the black community. Why the band never crossed over has always been a mystery. It had hits - ''Tuxedo Junction,'' ''After Hours'' - solid arrangements by Sammy Lowe and Bill Johnson and a high-octane Lunceford sound, and starred trumpet soloists like Dud Bascomb and the often overreaching Hawkins. They may have lacked a distinctive style, but they could fill a dance floor, and occasionally, as evidenced here on ''Tippin' In'' and ''Swing Out,'' they made music that lasts. - Richard B. Woodward Hank Thompson: 'Hank Thompson,' 'Livea at the Golden Nugget' Capitol 921242 (recorded 1947-61); all three formats. Stetson (recorded 1961; Sunshine Music Group, 508 Colorado Ave., Stuart, Fla. 34994); LP only. One of the great figures in honky-tonk country music, Mr. Thompson, who is still performing and recording, had his share of country hits - ''Wild Side of Life,'' ''Waiting in the Lobby of Your Heart,'' ''Six Pack to Go'' - most of which are on ''Hank Thompson,'' a 20-song collection. Mr. Thompson liked rhythm and often allowed his records to have a driving drumbeat - ''Rub-a-Dub-Dub'' and ''Wake Up, Irene'' have drum accents unusual for country music of the time - and a hard country feel to them, many of them woven through with Merle Travis's intricate guitar playing. His drifting voice could get tough, and with his band, the Brazos Valley Boys, he tears up a whole set of classic tunes on ''Live at the Golden Nugget,'' the first live album in country music history, and a highly successful one. Loaded with jazz-style improvisation and Mr. Thompson's plain-spoken voice, it's brilliant. - P. W.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Perhaps because a marketing gimmick can be one of the keys to success in writing a series of mysteries, Kinky Friedman is at once the author and the protagonist of his detective novels. In ''Frequent Flyer,'' his fourth whodunit, Mr. Friedman's hero, Kinky, a rock musician turned occasional snooper and constant smart mouth, is once again a sort of urban Indiana Jones, operating out of a lower Manhattan loft where he lives in a perpetual haze of cigar smoke with his cat. In this adventure, he is summoned to the funeral of an old Peace Corps buddy, only to find that the body in the coffin is not his friend but a stranger whom everyone else seems to regard as the legitimate article. As he tries to unravel the mystery, Kinky ventures from Manhattan to Bayonne, N.J., and also back in time to his years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Borneo. Kinky is a forensic Neil Simon, a king of the one-liners who comes up with such gems as the definition of the common Austrian affliction ''Waldheimer's disease,'' which occurs ''when you can't remember that you used to be a Nazi.'' In company with an unlikely pair of sidekicks named Ratso and Rambam, he hunts and is hunted by Nazi villains in a plot that's topped off with a reasonably bloody climax. ''Frequent Flyer,'' which has some fine descriptions of Borneo and its people (as well as of New York City and its people), is a more than passable companion for a short plane trip.

''One, two or three creatures similar to humans and a small robot came out'' of the ball-shaped spacecraft, Tass said. Vasya, one of several witnesses to the encounter, told another Soviet publication the aliens were nine feet tall, had a hump where their heads should have been and had three eyes apiece.

us,NONFICTION,"SINS OF THE FATHER: The True Story of a Family Running From the Mob. By Nick Taylor. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) The ostensible reason why Sal Polisi, a low-level mobster and gambler from New York City, decided to become an informer for Federal authorities was to give his two teen-age sons a chance in life. In reality, Mr. Polisi's motivation seems to have been a desire to avoid a long prison term for drug dealing. Whatever the reason, Nick Taylor, in ''Sins of the Father,'' portrays in careful detail the extraordinary impact on Mr. Polisi's wife and sons when he opted to wear a wire to get evidence against a corrupt state judge. To protect his safety, Mr. Polisi and his family had to enter the Federal Witness Protection Program; using new identities and living in another state, they began again. The Polisi family is shown as it made the transition from the familiar to a world bereft of family, friends, former jobs and schools, even the family dog. At one point Sal Jr., the eldest son, cries out: ''I didn't do anything. I didn't make any mistakes. . . . I didn't and [ his brother ] Joe didn't. And Mom didn't either. Why do we have to go?'' The family comes to understand that they, too, must atone for Sal Polisi's criminal past. While Mr. Taylor, a contributing editor to Conde Nast Traveler, does a fine job in relaying the family's narrative, he is unfortunately weak when it comes to explaining the roles of informants, prosecutors and agents in the Federal court system. We learn virtually nothing of Mr. Polisi's role at the judge's trial. Nor do we know why he winds up as the lead witness in an unrelated case, that of the reputed mob boss John Gotti, a development that takes over the book's final pages. As his nickname, Crazy Sal, suggests, Mr. Polisi is hardly a model of a credible witness. In the end, the corrupt judge is convicted and gets five years, and Mr. Gotti is acquitted. Mr. Polisi resumes his paternal role and gets to star in this book.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"RAYMOND CHANDLER'S LOS ANGELES. By Elizabeth Ward and Alain Silver. (Overlook, Cloth, $25; Paper, $19.95.) Perhaps no detective in fiction is so indelibly associated with a city as is Philip Marlowe with Los Angeles. In the variegated communities that make up the West Coast metropolis, Marlowe walked those ''mean streets . . . in search of a hidden truth,'' which his creator, Raymond Chandler, decreed was the proper path of the modern detective hero. The dream factories of Hollywood, the oceanfront playgrounds of Malibu, the seedy corruption of ''Bay City'' (actually Santa Monica) stimulated Chandler's overheated romantic imagination. Los Angeles, a city that has devoted itself to producing illusions, was an ideal backdrop for Chandler's labyrinthine tales of innocence outraged and avenged, described in his feverishly florid metaphors. ''Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles'' gives an illustrated tour of Marlowe's ''neon-lighted slum,'' with more than 100 photographs of some 60 locations described in the seven novels and 23 short stories published in Chandler's lifetime. Elizabeth Ward, a freelance writer, and Alain Silver, a motion-picture producer, have performed ably as literary detectives, tracing the sometimes lightly disguised models (Silver Lake became ''Gray Lake,'' for example). They also include informed, affectionate biographical comments on Chandler and his hard-boiled but softhearted sleuth. ''I don't mind Marlowe being a sentimentalist,'' Chandler said. ''All us tough guys are helpless sentimentalists at heart.''",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"DEAD BY MORNING. By Dorothy Simpson. (Scribners, $16.95.) The ninth mystery in this British writer's Luke Thanet detective series has classic ingredients: a dead body discovered in curious circumstances, lots of suspects and a tight-lipped village guarding its secrets. Two days after his return to the English hamlet where he grew up, the Martindale family's long-absent black sheep, Leo, lies dead in a ditch, the ostensible victim of a hit-and-run accident. The offending vehicle is identified as a van belonging to Longford Hall, once the Martindale family manor, now an elegant hotel run by Leo's sister and her husband. But annoyingly, for Detective-Inspector Thanet's purposes, virtually everyone within a 5-mile radius apparently drove the killer van at some point on the night that Leo died. And all of the drivers had reason to want him dead. Now, not surprisingly, a conspiracy of silence protects a murderer who seems to have done everyone a favor. ''I can't ever remember a case in which we had so many hostile witnesses,'' Thanet muses, but he's determined to find out who did the deed. Was it the deceased's lovely sister, whom Leo would have disinherited? An old family employee, whose life Leo ruined years ago? The insanely jealous husband of Leo's old flame? Red herrings strew the path that leads to the novel's clever ending, which has undeniable shock value. But readers may feel cheated that hints about the final revelations weren't also dropped along the way. In addition, Ms. Simpson has a distracting habit of introducing themes and characters that are unrelated to the plot and then doing nothing with them: the Draconian division chief who makes Thanet's life difficult, for example, or Thanet's problems with his children. But, in sum, ''Dead by Morning'' is an adroitly written mystery, absorbing even if it isn't enthralling.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Many trends have come and gone: The English country style swept the nation with cluttered rooms done in chintz and ribbons. Post-modern buildings, boasting pediments and oversize columns, began cropping up in all major cities. Deconstructivism, the hard-edged architectural movement that originated in California, was later immortalized in an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Now, as the decade comes to an end, there have been many lessons learned, many ideas synthesized. In place of the English style, a new breed of traditionalist is creating more pared-down interiors. Post-modern architects, instead of using historical references in a light-hearted manner, are now taking a more serious look at the past. Even deconstructivism, the most radical style of the decade, is softer and more livable.",1989-10-15T05:00:00+0000

A. None, because no team has won a pennant in each such decade. In fact no team has managed to get into the World Series in more than seven of the nine decades since Series play began in 1903. When the San Francisco Giants won the National League pennant last week and managed to squeeze in a Series appearance in the 1980's, it marked the seventh decade in which the Giants, based in New York through 1957, accomplished this. That tied the Giants with the Dodgers and the Yankees as the only teams to win pennants in seven different decades. The Giants missed in the 1940's and the 1970's; the Dodgers, based in Brooklyn through 1957, missed in the first decade and the 1930's; the Yankees did not win a pennant until 1921, missing the first two decades.",1989-10-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Talking Business with Callahan of Greiner Engineering; Proposals to Fix Public Works,"A recent spate of water-main breaks in New York City has provided another sign of the widespread deterioration of the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges and airports. Postponing maintenance of the country's public works has produced problems that some experts believe could cost $3.3 trillion to solve. Frank T. Callahan is president and chief executive of Greiner Engineering Inc., an 81-year-old design services company in Irving, Tex., that specializes in transportation and other public works projects. He insists that infrastructure improvements are an investment in the economy and that they should be a priority of government and business. Q. Isn't this a public policy issue for the Government to resolve? Why involve business? A. Clearly, responsibility for building and maintaining the nation's public works systems rests with the Government. However, the decaying condition of this infrastructure can acutely affect economic growth and development. Studies have demonstrated that a significant correlation exists between infrastructure investment and the health of the general economy. In Los Angeles, in 1988, costs of traffic congestion for both business and commuter travelers exceeded $500 million. And by 2005, traffic delays alone will cost the nation an estimated $50 billion a year in lost wages and wasted gasoline. Q. Just how pervasive is this problem? A. In a word, America's infrastructure is crumbling. Of the 2.1 million miles of paved roads, more than 60 percent require some degree of renovation and more than 40 percent of the bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. At the same time, the current number of highways, bridges and airports is inadequate to cope with the demand. As a result, traffic congestion regularly occurs on 70 percent of urban highways, and airport gridlock has reached epidemic proportions. Q. Why were public works projects postponed to the point of creating this crisis? A. Last year, a Congressionally mandated special commission, the National Council on Public Works Improvement, issued a report that succinctly answers that question: ''Of all public services, infrastructure may be the easiest to take for granted. When it functions best, it is noticed least.'' In fact, that is what happened. In seeking ways to trim expenditures from the budget, the Government reduced the annual increase in infrastructure spending from 4.5 percent in the 1961 to 1970 period to about eight-tenths of a percent between 1981 and 1987. Q. Since fiscal retrenchment remains in force, where will the money come from? A. Not only have budgetary constraints reduced funds available for public works projects, but the effort to shrink the deficit has prompted the Federal Government to withhold about $29 billion in user-paid revenues that are supposed to be reinvested in infrastructure projects like highway redevelopment. Releasing these revenues would be a good first step. However, the only conceivable way to really rebuild America's infrastructure is through a concerted program from all levels of government. Q. What would such a multilevel government commitment involve? A. There are any number of specific ideas being proposed and several bills are currently being debated in Congress. One recommendation calls for the creation of a Federal infrastructure bank to better manage the use of public works funds. Another proposal would make state and local governments responsible for the design and construction of all projects and limit the Federal role to co-financing the projects with the states and localities. Q. Relieving urban traffic congestion would seem to require additional infrastructure building, not just repairing what exists. How can this be accomplished, given urban land-use restrictions and space limitations? A. Our design engineering studies indicate many bottlenecks at interchanges between interstates and secondary traffic arteries. One promising solution is the ''urban interchange,'' a design configuration built within an existing right-of-way to improve traffic flow. In the case of airports, part of the solution requires improved air-traffic control, gate-capacity expansions and landing systems.",1989-10-17T05:00:00+0000

Dinkins buys 50 shares of class A common stock in Inner City Broadcasting Corp. for $5,000, or $100 per share. 1982 and 1983: Mr. Dinkins acquires 24 more shares at $275 per share. He receives 10 shares as a dividend. May 11, 1983: Mr. Dinkins, in a letter to Governor Cuomo's office, says the asset value of the 84 shares is $1,009,230.60, or $12,014.65 per share. The 84 shares amount to 1.13 percent of the company. Jan. 1, 1986: Mr. Dinkins is sworn in as Borough President and sells his stock, which he says now comes to 588 shares after a split, to his son, David Jr., for $58,000, or $98.64 per share. His son promises to pay for the stock with interest by 1991. Jan. 3, 1986: Inner City Broadcasting offers to buy back a limited number of shares of the company for $93.75 per share. Oct. 8, 1986: New York City's Board of Ethics advises Mr. Dinkins to abstain from voting on any matter involving Inner City. June 30, 1987: A member of Mr. Dinkin's staff votes in his name in favor of an office project in Harlem in which Inner City has an interest. Mr. Dinkins later said his staff was unaware that Inner City was involved.

Oct. 19, 1989: Mr. Dinkins, in an interview, says he valued the stock at more than $1 million after consulting with an Inner City official. He says he sold it two years later to his son for $58,000, setting the price on his own without consulting others. He says his son has not paid any money so far for the stock. Oct. 20, 1989: Mr. Dinkins, at a news conference, says that the $58,000 sale price reflected the reasonable value of the stock and approximately the same price at which the company was offering to buy back some of the shares. He says he valued the stock at more than $1 million two years before the sale, based on the judgement of company officials about the future of Inner City. Percy E. Sutton, the chairman of Inner City, says at a news conference that the difference between the $58,000 figure and the $1 million figure represented the difference between the market value of the shares and the market value of the entire company if it were broken up and sold.",1989-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"CARRINGTON: A Life. By Gretchen Gerzina. (Norton, $24.95.) Dora Carrington (1893-1932) was only a peripheral member of the Bloomsbury group, remembered today because of her curious relationship with Lytton Strachey, whom she loved and lived with for nearly 17 years, despite his homosexuality. Carrington was a difficult though charismatic figure. She was a study in contradictions: a loner who could be extremely social, a professed lover of truth who frequently lied, an artist driven to work though depressed by it. With her bohemian life (she lived with both Strachey and her husband, Ralph Partridge) and her outspoken rejection of most traditional women's roles, she seemed, at least from the outside, a symbol of the newly liberated 20th-century woman. But as Gretchen Gerzina makes clear in ''Carrington: A Life,'' there was a disparity between appearances and the actual stuff of Carrington's conflicted inner life. Behind the free-spirited romantic who always had at least two lovers waiting in the wings, the witty raconteur who charmed with her lively illustrations and graceful letters, stood a far more timid soul: a creature mortified by sex and riddled with self-doubt - a woman driven, finally, to suicide after the death of her platonic older lover, Strachey. Among other exaggerated claims, Ms. Gerzina, who teaches English at Vassar College, tends to make far too much of Carrington's importance as a painter, an argument she periodically states, though never convincingly demonstrates. (The truth was that Carrington's art was never as interesting as her romantic entanglements.) And given Ms. Gerzina's obvious familiarity with her subject, it is also unfortunate that she has provided so few psychological insights into the reasons for Carrington's separation of emotional love from the physical. Happily, however, these unanswered questions never seriously detract from Carrington's interest as a character. Even those who vowed never to read another book on Bloomsbury will find themselves drawn in.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Failing that, the star's fans may have their ears opened, and some might seek out the original sources (which are likely to reach more record stores in the wake of a cross-cultural hit album). The darker possibility is that the star could strip-mine a musical culture, reducing time-etched styles to pop novelties and then move on.

us,NONFICTION,"ISTANBUL INTRIGUES. By Barry Rubin. (McGraw-Hill, $18.95.) Throughout World War II, neutral Turkey remained an oasis attracting refugees, political plotters, deserters, profiteers, assassins, international beauties, journalists and spies. High-stakes intrigue became Turkey's national industry, even as bombers, tanks and death camps were laying waste to much of Europe. Romantic legends of adventure and espionage were born amid the shadows and seedy glitter of wartime Istanbul, and the historic bases of these legends are the subject of ''Istanbul Intrigues.'' A stream of vignettes introduces such leading players as Franz von Papen, Hitler's suavely duplicitous Ambassador to Turkey, and George V. Earle, a brawling former United States Ambassador to Bulgaria. Along the way we meet a host of rival spies from the fledgling American O.S.S., the British M.I.6, the Soviet N.K.V.D. and two bitterly competing Nazi spy organizations, the Abwehr and the Sicherheitsdienst. Players in the narrative include prominent Zionists, a future pope, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Cicero, the renowned Axis spy whose job as valet to the British Ambassador enabled him to steal Allied plans for the invasion of France. Barry Rubin, whose previous books include ''Modern Dictators'' and ''Secrets of State,'' marshals an immense amount of archival material to show that despite their frenetic efforts, the legion of foreign agents working in Turkey accomplished little in changing the course of the war. As history, ''Istanbul Intrigues'' is informative, but as entertainment it is somewhat disappointing. The author tries to cover so much ground that most of the hundreds of fascinating characters in his narrative are spared only a few tantalizing lines. The result is more a catalogue of names than a collection of biographical sketches, and the reader is left hungry for more nourishing fare.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000
us,I.B.M.'s Urbane New Place in the Sun in Texas,"The first sign that Solana is not like other suburban office parks is the three 100-foot-tall pylons - one magenta, one purple, one yellow - that stand in the rolling Texas prairie like pieces of a gargantuan building toy left in a thousand-acre backyard. The pylons announce Solana's presence from a mile down the freeway, and they foretell the nature of its architecture, a series of stucco-clad buildings with intense, rich color and a surprisingly urbane presence. Solana, which means ''sunny place'' in Spanish, looks from a distance as if it might be a resort, not a suburban office and retail complex: its buildings are all low, and its 900-acre site is lushly landscaped. But this place is not, in fact, part of the new trend toward making suburban offices so sybaritic that they resemble getaway islands; Solana is quite rigorous in its design, and for all its elaborate landscaping and lively architecture it actually has more of the qualities of a true village than almost any other suburban development of the last few years. This is a place whose design begins to address the critical problems of suburban office parks everywhere: how to deal honestly with the infuriatingly necessary automobile, and how to create a convincing and meaningful sense of place.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Mystery buffs who also happen to be baseball fans can enjoy both pastimes at once in ''The Dead Pull Hitter,'' an energetic first novel by the Toronto sportswriter Alison Gordon. The lineup of Ms. Gordon's fictional Toronto Titans includes all the archetypes of baseball lore - crafty veterans and insufferable superstars, good-hearted heroes and washed-up sluggers struggling to eke out one more season. With equal measures of cynicism and sympathy, Ms. Gordon also captures the flavor of the game off the field: a hot-shot agent is rumored to have ruined a budding star who dared to break his contract with him; a second-rate catcher turned public relations man wears the look of ''all the baseball dreams that never come true.'' The most acute observer of these goings-on is Ms. Gordon's narrator (and apparent alter ego), Kate Henry, a 40-year-old baseball writer who covers the Titans for The Toronto Planet. She also turns amateur detective when Pedro (Sultan) Sanchez, the team's designated hitter, is found murdered in his apartment the day the team clinches its first division title, and Cy Young Award winner Steve (Stevie the K) Thorson is beaten to death with a baseball bat in the team's locker room the evening after. The reader can guess what happens next: Kate and Staff Sgt. Lloyd Munro, the detective assigned to the case, meet, flirt, compete and eventually work together to nab the murderer. Some of the clues are obvious and there are holes in the plot, but the authentic, often flaky details of daily baseball life still make diverting reading.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Playing in Edmonton with the visiting Los Angeles Kings, his team since a trade in 1988, the Great Gretzky, as he is known, became the greatest scorer in the history of the National Hockey League. His goal late in the third period broke Gordie Howe's record of 1,850 points scored over 26 seasons. Mr. Gretzky is only 28 years old and set his mark barely into his 11th season. Mr. Howe was the boyhood idol of Mr. Gretzky and the two first met in 1972 when Mr. Gretzky was 11 years old. At the time, Mr. Howe offered some advice to the future No. 99: work on the backhand. Mr. Howe, who was on hand to see his record broken with a backhanded shot, predicted that Mr. Gretzky will reach 3,000 points before he is through. Mr. Gretzky said it was ''only fitting'' that he set the record in Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum, where he played for nine seasons and where a bronze statue of him stands at the entrance.

us,INDIA WITHOUT NONSENSE,"''O new Palms!!! O flowers!! O creatures!! O beasts!! Violent and amazing delight at the wonderful variety of life and dress here. . . . Colours, and costumes, and myriadism of impossible picturesqueness!!!'' So exclaimed Edward Lear in his diary with characteristic enthusiasm in 1873 when he arrived in Bombay for what was to be his last extended journey. Besides offering some of the watercolors Lear made on that last visit to India, IMPOSSIBLE PICTURESQUENESS: Edward Lear's Indian Watercolours, 1873-1875 (Columbia University Press, $65) is also a richly delicate feast of some of Lear's finest and least-known work. The constant sense of delight and whimsy that permeates the journals and notations Lear habitually made when he was drawing makes clear the single vision that links the graphic and written work of the brilliant creator of limericks and nonsense verse. Vidya Dehejia, who teaches art history and archeology at Columbia University, reveals in her selections from the journals, and in her informed remarks thereon, the way in which this worldly sophisticate, who was at home in a variety of settings, remained at heart an Englishman. He thought the sky in Calcutta was reminiscent of Manchester, and Cawnpore was like Sussex. During a monsoon in Poona, it was ''all flat and wet, reminding me of Cambridgeshire.'' The watercolor drawings themselves are light and precise, with features of architectural detail, terrain, flora and fauna more thoroughly rendered than human figures, which Lear tended to treat more abstractly. Allen Staley, a professor of art history at Columbia, titles his perceptive essay ''The Painter of Topographical Poetry.'' This is a perfect characterization. Above all, these are pictures that are intelligent and poetic reports on places as they looked, on a particular day at a particular time, to a worldly, weary self-described ''globular foolish topographer.''",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Geena Davis is the film's best feature, as a zany manicurist who encounters life-size fur-covered aliens, led by an endearing one played by Jeff Goldblum. The movie can't sustain its lunatic premise and ''often works better as a clever idea than a funny film.'' (Caryn James) Dead Bang 1989. Warner Home Video. $89.95. LD, $24.98. 1:42. CC. R. In Robert Foster's screenplay, which seems not so much written as pasted together from the shredded remains of scripts for old made-for-television movies, Don Johnson stars as a Los Angeles homicide detective who, while investigating the murder of a policeman, uncovers a neo-Nazi political conspiracy. John Frankenheimer has made the movie look better than it should. For all of its camera movement, its chases and its gunfights, it ''gives the impression of just sitting there, waiting - hoping - for a commercial interruption.'' (Canby) A World Apart 1988. Media Home Entertaiment. $89.95. 1:54. CC. PG. This film, the first directed by the Oscar-winning cameraman Chris Menges, won a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and for their contributions to it, Barbara Hershey, Jodhi May and Linda Mvusi shared the best-actress award. It presents the story of a white woman in South Africa who, working clandestinely to correct what she sees to be an intolerable political situation, nearly wrecks the emotional life of her adoring daughter. ''It's a beautifully acted, maddening movie that, while expressing all the right sentiments, never goes quite far enough.'' (Canby) The Dark Corner 1946. CBS/Fox Home Video. $59.98. 1:39. CC. Not rated. A private detective is marked as the fall guy in a cleverly contrived murder plot. ''When a talented director and a resourceful company of players meet up with a solid story,'' a contemporary critic wrote, ''then movie-going becomes a particular pleasure.'' The director was Henry Hathaway, and the cast included Lucille Ball in ''one of her happier roles as an acid-tongued secretary,'' along with Mark Stevens, Clifton Webb and William Bendix. A ''sizzling piece of melodrama.''",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

At the K.G.B.'s invitation, Mr. Wallenberg's half-brother and half-sister, Guy Von Dardel and Nina Lagergren, visited Moscow last week to accept recently discovered personal documents - notebooks and identification papers - of Mr. Wallenberg's. But the papers ''do not prove that Raoul is dead,'' said Mrs. Lagergren. Mr. von Dardel said there was evidence that Mr. Wallenberg had been seen as recently as 1980 in the Vladimir Prison near Moscow.

us,NONFICTION,"TO LIVE LIKE EVERYONE. By Anatoly Marchenko. Translated by Paul Goldberg. (Holt, $19.95.) In 1966, Anatoly Marchenko had a brief respite from what was to become a long career as a political prisoner in the Soviet Union. Before his incarceration in 1958 - he was jailed once in the wake of a workers' brawl and again after a near-escape into Iran - Marchenko had been a young, self-satisfied construction foreman. But when he re-entered the world, he was a man without social identity: neither worker nor intellectual, unemployable yet constantly under threat of arrest. He went from town to town, working what jobs he could without a permit. Eventually he managed to write a book, ''My Testimony,'' about the political labor camps many people thought had been dismantled under Khrushchev. ''To Live Like Everyone,'' Marchenko's third and last book - he died in prison in 1986 - is in part the story of his struggle to write ''My Testimony.'' That effort reached fruition when Western publishers printed the smuggled manuscript in 1967, giving the West one of its first glimpses of post-Stalinist political prisoners and sending its author back to jail. But ''To Live Like Everyone,'' well translated from the Russian by Paul Goldberg, is also a string of anecdotes so cruel, and so ironic, they could have been lifted from an early picaresque novel. Marchenko is a loner in a world of collectivists. By the time he returned to the camps, he had become a near-perfect dissident, yielding nothing and risking everything for the right to be who he was.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"DEADFALL. By Patti Davis. (Crown, $17.95.) This literary plea for a hands-off policy in Nicaragua is particularly plaintive, coming as it does from the daughter of a President. The actress, songwriter and political activist Patti Davis, Ronald and Nancy Reagan's daughter, took on the American presence in Vietnam in her first novel, ''Home Front,'' which was written with Maureen Strange Foster. This earnest, amiable new novel (her first solo flight) is about a California painter whose life is thrown into turmoil because her film maker husband uncovers some covert operations in Nicaragua. Engaging, aimless Darren Laverty and her husband, Andrew, have an enviable sex life; they always sleep tangled together (''they made love in the silvery light, the wine heavy as syrup in their veins and their bodies still warm from the Jacuzzi''). Then, in Central America, Andrew films scenes of violence that have apparently been prompted by American intervention. Ms. Davis intercuts such crucial developments with more mundane interludes, like Darren adopting a dog, visiting friends and working out at a gym. After a second foray south, Andrew returns with evidence against the covert forces and soon thereafter dies violently, just as Darren discovers she's pregnant. She vows to get to the truth of just why her husband was murdered. Meanwhile Senator Kent Janes, who will attempt an official investigation, soldiers on in a miserably unhappy marriage while the Lavertys' reporter friend, Sean Trudell, continues his own search for evidence. It's only a matter of time before these nice folks get together. Behind the conspiracy are the usual suspects, including a crazed colonel and a family member dear to Darren. ''They got all of us, didn't they?'' Darren concludes. ''We all walked into the same trap from different directions and for different reasons. But we've all ended up wounded.'' In ''Deadfall,'' nobody - not even the author - emerges unscathed from the world of politics.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

The first thing we learn from this exhibition is that in the everyday things around him - a clothespin, a cork, a fishbone, a discarded can of this or that - he saw disinherited ingredients that could be put to magical use. We knew that already, in a general way, but never before have we seen so many proofs of it in one place at one time. In his own houses - whether in Roxbury, Conn., or in Sache, near Tours, in France - that gift for metamorphosis ran free and was never in short supply. In this exhibition there is replayed the situation that greeted the visitor. Every last corner of every room, every place, bore his mark. If Robinson Crusoe on his island had had his family with him and decided to re-create the world of domesticity in its every detail, he would have aimed to do what Calder did. But there has only been one A. Calder, and I doubt that R. Crusoe would have been in the same class.",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,New &Noteworthy,"OUT OF THIS WORLD, by Graham Swift. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $7.95.) As Harry Beech, an aerial photographer, flies over the English landscape, his daughter lies on a psychoanalyst's couch in Manhattan. Both try to figure out how their relationship went wrong. ''Not a book the reader is likely to forget, 'Out of This World' deserves to be ranked at the forefront of contemporary literature,'' Linda Gray Sexton said here last year. ADAM, EVE, AND THE SERPENT, by Elaine Pagels. (Vintage, $8.95.) In her examination of Genesis 1-3 the author of ''The Gnostic Gospels'' shows how politics might have helped transform the cryptic Garden of Eden myth from a celebration of freedom to a condemnation of original sin. The book ''has the distinctive qualities so many admired in her work on the Gnostic Gospels,'' Robin Lane Fox said in The Book Review last year. ''It is very clearly written. It has form, moral impetus and direction.'' THE DREAMS OF REASON: The Computer and the Rise of the Sciences of Complexity, by Heinz R. Pagels. (Bantam, $9.95.) Mr. Pagels, who died in a mountaineering accident in Colorado in 1988, writes that like the telescope and the microscope the computer will be a tool that brings on a new scientific age. Last year our reviewer, Brian Hayes, said this ''casual, discursive book . . . contains as much philosophy as science, and it includes a generous measure of informal autobiography and anecdote as well.'' In one section of the book, Mr. Pagels writes, ''I remain an optimist and believe that the liberating capacity of our knowledge, along with a little wisdom, will affirm the power of life over death. I continue to believe that the distant day will come when the order of human affairs is not entirely established by domination.'' AROUND THE DAY IN EIGHTY WORLDS, by Julio Cortazar. Translated by Thomas Christensen. (North Point, $11.95.) The cast of characters in Julio Cortazar's literary game includes Marcel Duchamp, Louis Armstrong and a cat named Theodor W. Adorno. ''With this miscellany that's as challenging as an infinite exercise in connect-the-dots, a color-by-number landscape a la Salvador Dali, the late Argentine fabulist constructs yet another prototype of literature as schoolboy's amusement,'' John Krich said here in 1986. ''Profundity is the grand prize and the winner is the first player to disregard the rules altogether.'' PASSION & CUNNING: Essays on Nationalism, Terrorism and Revolution, by Conor Cruise O'Brien. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) When this collection of writings was published last year our reviewer, Linda Robinson, said the book is ''a service to anyone unfamiliar with his lucid prose. Mr. O'Brien takes on the most intractable conflicts, puncturing fashionable views with pungent comments that sometimes make his fellow liberals uncomfortable.'' PALM LATITUDES, by Kate Braverman. (Penguin, $8.95.) In East Los Angeles, a capital of the steamy, rotting land Kate Braverman calls the Palm Latitudes, Francisca, Gloria and Marta feel doubly alienated because they are female as well as Hispanic. Last year The Times's reviewer, Michiko Kakutani, said the author ''possesses a magical, incantatory voice and the ability to loft ordinary lives into the heightened world of myth, and in using these gifts to recount the tales of these three women she has succeeded in creating a work of hallucinatory, poetic power.'' Penguin has also republished Ms. Braverman's 1979 novel LITHIUM FOR MEDEA ($7.95.), which is set in the Los Angeles of the 60's. THE INVENTION OF MEMORY: A New View of the Brain, by Israel Rosenfield. (Basic, $9.95.) Memories are not fixed images stored in the brain, the author argues, but imaginative reconstructions. In 1988 our reviewer, James W. Lance, said the argument was overdrawn but that the book ''will stimulate interest in one of the most intriguing aspects of brain function.'' THE SWIMMING-POOL LIBRARY, by Alan Hollinghurst. (Vintage, $8.95.) A young, upper-crust British homosexual meets a like-minded older man and together they learn that gay culture cuts through the boundaries of class. ''Like Edmund White, Alan Hollinghurst is a polished poet of homosexual desire,'' Catherine R. Stimpson said here last year. His novel ''tells of impurities with shimmering elegance, of complexities with a camp-fired wit and of truths with a fiction's solid grace.'' BROTHERS: Black and Poor - A True Story of Courage and Survival, by Sylvester Monroe and Peter Goldman, with Vern E. Smith, Terry E. Johnson, Monroe Anderson and Jacques Chenet. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A dozen black men who grew up on Chicago's South Side tell about their successes, but mostly their failures to escape from the ghetto. ''You see men of substance, who they are and how they got to be that way,'' Phyllis Crockett said here last year. ''In 'Brothers' we come to understand why so few make it.'' FATAL LIGHT, by Richard Currey. (Penguin, $6.95.) This story of a young West Virginia man who becomes a medic in Vietnam is ''a spare, elegant novel that manages to summon several layers of images, some quite beautiful, others horrifying,'' Meg Wolitzer said in The Book Review last year. HIS EMINENCE AND HIZZONER: A Candid Exchange, by John O'Connor and Edward I. Koch. (Avon, $4.95.) The Mayor and the Archbishop of New York talk about gay rights, AIDS, abortion and other subjects on which they fundamentally disagree. This is ''a fascinating book,'' Andrew Hacker said in these pages earlier this year. ''They have used this set of alternating essays to present their ideas in some depth.''",1989-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Treats: Keep treats in the bag until children get home. Cut and examine all fruit. Throw away all unwrapped candy. Remember that some hospitals X-ray Halloween candy free. Fire Safety: Make sure costumes are fire-resistant. Keep candle-lit pumpkins out of children's reach, not on porches or doorsteps. Make sure smoke alarms work.

One day in 1957, Akio Morita, the co-founder and chairman of the Sony Corporation, turned down a purchase order for 100,000 new transistor radios from the Bulova Corporation because Bulova would sell them only if the radios carried the Bulova brand name. Mr. Morita refused because he believed building Sony's brand image was more important than a huge sale. Looking back, Mr. Morita says that decision was the best he ever made. That tale appeared two years ago in Mr. Morita's autobiography, ''Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony,'' but Robert Heller retells it in ''The Decision Makers'' because he wants to make a point. ''The history of any great entrepreneurial business consists of milestone decisions,'' he writes. The editor of the British business publication Management Today, Mr. Heller finds many lessons for managers and would-be managers in the dozens of anecdotes and abbreviated case studies he collects here. He relies mainly on accounts from major business publications in the United States and Europe, and on popular books of recent vintage. There is nary a whiff of fresh reporting. Factual errors are annoying, but they are infrequent and mostly minor. Mr. Heller likes lists and bromides. He is full of advice and authority distilled from briefly sketched turning points of well-known companies - Chrysler, Ford, I.B.M., Jaguar and Compaq Computer, among others. ''The Decision Makers'' covers familiar ground effervescently and stirs up the scent of the diverse and daring maneuvers in business competition. But Mr. Heller reaches too high. His claim to deliver a guide to effective executive decisions is suspect from the start. By the end, the blend of pedantry, limited scope and superficial detail has turned mind-numbing.",1989-10-29T05:00:00+0000

This could have been a deadly academic treatment, full of charts and graphs, footnotes and tables. Instead, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, has written a relaxed, readable account of the hows and whys of change in American corporations. In tomorrow's corporate Olympics, the prizes will go to the businesses and managers who have met the challenge of ''the ultimate corporate balancing act'': organizational and structural changes that will require, simultaneously, cutting back and growing, doing more with less. It is a complex world, Ms. Kanter says, and Americans are up against tough competition. Business is in transition because the world economy is changing, and the author peppers her pages with examples. While older corporations, like Eastman Kodak, learn to update their approaches, newer ones, like Apple Computer, are evolving from entrepreneurial start-ups to more mature, settled organizations. Change is the key: becoming lean without becoming mean, restructuring for maximum ''entrepreneurial thrust,'' developing and using synergies. (Once an upstart buzzword, ''synergy'' is now an accepted academic term meaning a ''whole that multiplies the value of the parts.'') Synergies involve getting more for less; hence the streamlining, bureaucracy-cutting, decentralizing that are necessary in today's postentrepreneurial corporate world. For all the change, however, and the uncharted waters ahead, Ms. Kanter makes it clear that people are the dominant factor and the most important resource in a successful business. The demands on them are multiple and conflicting; restructuring can disempower them, but they are the key to success or failure.",1989-10-29T05:00:00+0000

''The choices for men became narrower,'' says Claudia Brush Kidwell, costume curator for the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and its current exhibition, ''Men and Women: A History of Costume, Gender and Power.'' Whereas decoration had once been the mark of male status and individuality, it grew to be associated with more-feminine flourishes. In time, says Kidwell, ''conformity to a very specific ideal became the standard.

Mr. Bakker, meet Judge Robert Potter. In sentencing Mr. Bakker last week to 45 years in prison and a $500,000 fine for fraud and conspiracy, Judge Potter severely tongue-lashed the erstwhile cleric. ''Those of us who do have religion are sick of being saps for money-grubbing preachers and priests,'' said Judge Potter. The main charges against Mr. Bakker -he was accused of selling his followers more vacations at his Heritage USA Christian resort than he could provide - emerged in investigations that began after Jessica Hahn, a former church secretary, said in 1987 that she had been paid $265,000 to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him.

Angel 49568; three CD's and cassettes. Those who have long and justly championed ''Porgy'' as a great opera may find its recent accession to the mainstream a mixed vindication. ''Porgy'' has made the Met at last; Glyndebourne has treated it as a masterpiece; the present recording (stemming from Glyndebourne) is the third full-score, major-label effort. It makes a stronger case than did this year's lugubrious Met revival, but the work sounds more dated and less sure-footed than we had hoped. As song succeeds song and ensemble climax succeeds ensemble climax, one begins to feel as earlier producers did: This needs cutting. It also needs a brisker stride; Simon Rattle's love of the score is apparent in the lush textures, but also in indulgent tempos. There is polish and care in the singing and playing and much spirit in quick numbers. And some of the voices are beautiful. But the whole feels overinflated. - Will Crutchfield Gubaidulina: 'Offertorium,' 'Hommage a T. S. Eliot' Gidon Kremer, violin; Boston Symphony conducted by Charles Dutoit (''Offertorium''); Christine Whittlesey, soprano (''Hommage''). Deutsche Grammophon 427 336; CD only. No less admirable than Gidon Kremer's superb artistry are the varied uses to which it is put. Mr. Kremer has performed tremendous service on behalf of living composers, notably the Russians Alfred Schnittke and Sofia Gubaidulina. He has played ''Offertorium'' (1980), Miss Gubaidulina's deconstruction of the ''royal'' theme from Bach's ''Musical Offering,'' with several American orchestras, and it's good, finally, to have a representative account on record. The coupling with the Eliot ''Hommage'' (1987), for soprano and instrumental octet, makes for a well-filled disk (69:05) of challenging and rewarding contemporary music. Like the violinist, this inventive composer merits close attention. - James R. Oestreich Grieg: 'Peer Gynt' Excerpts Barbara Hendricks, soprano; Oslo Philharmonic Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. CBS Masterworks 44528; CD and cassette. ''I am sure my music has a taste of codfish in it,'' said Edvard Grieg once, and it's certainly true of this most consciously Nordic of his scores. (He tended in his later years to regard it as a youthful indiscretion.) Esa-Pekka Salonen, who has moved from strength to strength in the Scandinavian repertoire, leads a fresh, idiomatic performance of these well-chosen excerpts (all the major numbers, and several less familiar ones), and Barbara Hendricks sings the ballads with her usual mastery and charm. - Barrymore L. Scherer Schuman: Violin Concerto; Bernstein: Serenade Robert McDuffie, violin; St. Louis Symphony conducted by Leonard Slatkin. Angel CDC 7 49464-2; CD only. Americans haven't, for some reason, produced many great violin concertos. Only the Barber has become well known, but William Schuman's strong-fisted, deeply felt concerto and Leonard Bernstein's oddly seductive pseudo-symphonic poem about love and Plato for solo violin, strings, harp and percussion, both first performed in the early 50's, are candidates for wider renown. And Robert McDuffie, an ardent young violinist from Georgia with technique to burn, may just be the soloist they have been waiting for. His impassioned but utterly solid readings generate maximum excitement in the fast sections and make splendid rhapsodies out of the lyric moments and cadenzas. Leonard Slatkin and his band underscore with their usual lapel-grabbing vivacity. - Mark Swed Oliveros-Dempster-Panaiotis: 'Deep Listening' Pauline Oliveros, accordion; Stuart Dempster, trombone; Panaiotis, vocals. New Albion NA-022; CD only. In October 1988, the composer-accordionist Pauline Oliveros, the composer-trombonist Stuart Dempster and the composer-vocalist Panaiotis descended into an abandoned underground water cistern in Washington State to use the enormously resonant acoustical space as an environment for group improvisation. The result is ''Deep Listening,'' an astonishing aural experience. Capitalizing on a 45-second reverberation time, the performers build up long, eerie drones that echo long after they have moved on to new material; slowly the drones and melodic arabesques coalesce into luminous clouds of sound, by turns meditative, ritualistic or enraptured. ''Deep Listening'' asks only that listeners relinquish Western notions of directionality and climax; those who do will be richly rewarded. - K. Robert Schwarz POP/JAZZ Peter Stampfel and the Bottle Caps: 'The People's Republic of Rock 'n' Roll' Homestead HMS 133; all three formats. An insouciant combination of oddball folk and wry rock, this is the former Holy Modal Rounder Peter Stampfel's second album with his band, the Bottle Caps. Mr. Stampfel uses punk yowls, surf music and reggae as specialized tools of eccentric expression, not sales pitches. His frail, amiably cracked voice in tandem with his capering fiddle work helps banish archness from smart jokes like the satire of Top-40 uplift ''When Things Come True,'' and ''Bridge and Tunnel Girls,'' a cheeky Manhattan reply to the Beach Boys' ''California Girls.'' Any savvy listener should be tickled by some of the fancies here. - Milo Miles Billy Joel: 'Storm Front' Columbia 44366; all three formats. Mr. Joel's first studio album in three years is his bounciest record since ''Glass Houses'' in 1980. Produced by Mick Jones (the lead guitarist for Foreigner) instead of Mr. Joel's regular partner Phil Ramone, it has a muddier English art-rock flavor than his other records. Its catchiest cut is the almost-rap song ''We Didn't Start the Fire,'' in which the 40-year-old singer lists 40 years of news headlines. Its strongest ballad, ''Leningrad,'' is a personal vignette about the easing of cold-war tensions, and ''The Downeaster 'Alexa' '' sympathizes with Long Island fishermen whose grounds are being depleted. Although the album lacks the consistency of Mr. Joel's most ambitious record, ''The Nylon Curtain,'' it still has plenty of verve and personality. - Stephen Holden Poi Dog Pondering: 'Poi Dog Pondering' Columbia 45335; all three formats. Late-1980's pessimism hasn't reached Poi Dog Pondering, a band that keeps on the sunny side. It's nominally a rock group (from Hawaii by way of Athens, Ga.), but one that also pulls out trumpet or accordion or tin whistle as needed, in songs that smile through daily ups and downs, from the pleasures of toast and jelly to the uncertainties of romance. The group updates hippie eclecticism with touches of 1980's world-beat; for all their dexterity, the songs sound like impromptu sing-alongs. ''Poi Dog Pondering,'' the band's first major-label album, simply combines its two independently released EPs, preserving their homespun charm. - Jon Pareles Shelly Hirsch and David Weinstein: 'Haiku Lingo' Review Records 139; LP only (available from Lunch for Your Ears, 25 Prince St., New York, N. Y. 10012). Few groups can meander as wildly as Ms. Hirsch and Mr. Weinstein do and still sustain a listener's interest. Ms. Hirsch, an extraordinary vocalist and a major figure on the downtown scene, chatters and talks and sings and mimics different languages, interacting with Mr. Weinstein's keyboards and electronics. Techno-pop gets a parody; she'll mumble through an ostensibly serious section of a piece, European classical music is reduced to a rubble, and all musical genres are used for their references, not their forms. Through everything runs Ms. Hirsch's personality, enormously inventive, scathingly satiric and virtuosic. - Peter Watrous 'Paul Motian on Broadway,' Vol. 1 JMT 834430-2; all three formats. This is Bill Frisell's year. After a sensational solo album, the guitarist walks away with this date, designed to highlight the drummer Paul Motian. To songs by Kern, Gershwin, Porter and Arlen, Mr. Frisell adds a country twang, his ghostly, reverbed chords sounding intimate and far away, as though picked up from a radio signal long ago. Mr. Motian's penchant for slow tempos and open textures creates a discreet but subdued atmosphere, as though no one should speak out. But on ''Someone to Watch Over Me'' his expert brush work, joined to Charlie Hayden's bass and Joe Lovano's quiet saxophone, sets off one of Mr. Frisell's best solos on record. - Richard B. Woodward",1989-10-29T05:00:00+0000

But basically, these activities or places are not particularly conducive to first-class thoughts, the kind that may not prompt a cry of ''Eureka, I've got it,'' but are nevertheless pretty good. Where does inspiration strike? Obviously, in isolated instances, anywhere at any time. But the one place that seems to ignite the creative process in an amazing number of people is the shower. This may be because the shower is, in a sense, something of a refuge. The only sound is usually that of running water, and for most people it's one of the few places the telephone doesn't intrude.",1989-10-29T05:00:00+0000

His innocence did not last. A computer specialist, Mr. Katzenstein went to work for Sony as part of a yearlong fellowship. Expecting to bear witness to the dazzling efficiency of a leading Japanese corporation, he instead found an office filled with grim workers whose greatest virtue was endurance. ''Funny Business'' is best when Mr. Katzenstein describes the lot of the Japanese around him, and the lot of the foreigner trying to fit in. Though his language skills are limited, he is expected to attend meetings just to show that he is part of the team. His training sessions are conducted in Japanese. Despite his best efforts, Mr. Katzenstein remains the outsider - a status that no foreigner in Japan can ever expect to escape. However, the book loses its way when an increasingly frustrated and embittered Mr. Katzenstein ventures outside the office and begins explaining why Japan is the way it is. He mars his story with inaccuracies, generalizations and declarations that he characterizes as an insider's answer to an all-too-generous depiction of Japanese business practices by the American press. Unfortunately, he tells us little that is new, and one wishes that despite the considerable obstacles he faced in finding a place at Sony, he had told us more about the workplace and spent less time making declarations about subjects he was less able to judge.",1989-10-29T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE PLACE IN FLOWERS WHERE POLLEN RESTS, by Paul West. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) After a descent into some of the worst white America has to offer - the Los Angeles pornography industry and the war in Vietnam - a young Hopi Indian returns to the center of his earth in the Arizona mesas. Last year our reviewer, Thomas R. Edwards, called this ''a rich, often astonishing meditation upon how a particular human culture can represent a source of 'otherness' - the imagination itself - that persists even in a world that other modes of thought and desire have made almost uninhabitable.'' A BRIGHT SHINING LIE: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam, by Neil Sheehan. (Vintage, $12.95.) John Paul Vann was the one officer the correspondents covering the Vietnam War felt they could trust. But in the end he, like the war itself, turned out to be a carefully crafted deception. ''Immensely long, enormously ambitious, told with an emotion that bursts through its pages, this is an impressive achievement,'' Ronald Steel said in The Book Review last year. ''If there is one book that captures the Vietnam War in the sheer Homeric scale of its passion and folly, this book is it.'' It won both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award. BELIEVE THEM, by Mary Robison. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) In one of these short stories, a retarded girl and her siblings briefly take control of the house while their parents are away. Last year our reviewer, Larry McCaffery, complimented Mary Robison on ''her fascination with the grotesque and darkly comic, her characterizations of quirky people possessing odd tics of speech and behavior - in short, her intuitive feel for the surrealistic dimensions of American life that lie barely concealed under the ordinary.'' GUMSHOE: Reflections in a Private Eye, by Josiah Thompson. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) In this memoir, a Kierkegaard scholar tells how he suffered an existential crisis and changed his life by becoming a private eye. ''Surveillance reminds him of the closing section of Sartre's 'Being and Nothingness,' '' The Times's John Gross said last year. ''References to Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger are all in a day's work.'' STORIES IN AN ALMOST CLASSICAL MODE, by Harold Brodkey. (Vintage, $12.95.) In some very long stories with very long sentences, Harold Brodkey writes about the relentlessness of suffering. ''The prose, then, is a prose of painful abundance,'' Frank Kermode said here last year. ''He recollects in a sort of poetic fury, nothing is too strained or too bizarre.'' ''WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?'': Further Adventures of a Curious Character, by Richard P. Feynman with Ralph Leighton. (Bantam, $9.95.) Last year our reviewer, James Gleick, said this sequel to ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman'' shows that the physicist was ''not just a bongo-playing, skirt-chasing, joke-telling prankster, but a man, always earnest and sometimes troubled, who thought more deeply than most about the power and the limitations of science.'' The book includes Feynman's experiences as a member of the commission investigating the Challenger explosion. MASCARA, by Ariel Dorfman. (Penguin, $7.95.) A man without a face uses photography to steal the visages of others. This novel is ''an ominous fairy tale, a literary horror story, a post-modern version of Jekyll and Hyde,'' Robert Atwan said here last year. ''But the book is also a parable of human identity and paranoia engendered by authoritarian politics.'' UNDER A CRUEL STAR: A Life in Prague, 1941-1968, by Heda Margolius Kovaly. Translated by Franci Epstein and Helen Epstein with the author. (Penguin, $8.95.) A Czechoslovak Jew tells how she escaped from Auschwitz, only to suffer later under Stalin's crushing of the Prague Spring. ''Mrs. Kovaly experienced the two supreme horrors of what Hannah Arendt called this terrible century,'' Anthony Lewis said in The Times in 1986. ''But her book is not just a personal memoir of inhumanity. In telling her story - simply, without self-pity - she illuminates some general truths of human behavior.'' HOT SIBERIAN, by Gerald A. Browne. (Avon, $4.95.) In this thriller about an international diamond caper involving the Soviet Union, ''the plot gets more and more complicated, the pace wilder and wilder,'' Newgate Callendar said here earlier this year. ''The beautifully written 'Hot Siberian' will keep you entranced.'' THE BODY IN TIME, by Kenneth Jon Rose. (Wiley, $10.95.) Ticking in rhythms as brief as milliseconds, as long as years, the human body is a carefully synchronized machine, as the biologist Kenneth Jon Rose explains in this book. Last year our reviewer, Iris Poliski, said its fascinating text was studded with arresting bits of information ''like garlic slivers plugged into a roast.'' AN AMERICAN MEMORY, by Eric Larsen. (Anchor/Doubleday, $7.95.) A young man is driven toward madness as he tries to understand his childhood on a remote Minnesota farm with an austere Lutheran father. '' 'An American Memory' is as much a prose poem as a novel,'' Dinitia Smith said here last year. Eric Larsen has written it ''in language as sparse and wind-riven as the Midwest of his imagination.'' ECHOES OF REVOLT: The Masses, 1911-1917, edited by William L. O'Neill. (Elephant/Ivan R. Dee, $18.95.) In its day a little magazine called The Masses was considered so radical that in 1917 the United States Post Office refused to allow it in the mails. In 1966 our reviewer, Peter Lyon, said that capturing its spirit in this anthology of writing, cover art and cartoons called for ''a kind of psychic taxidermy.''

us,Talking Business with Horner of KPMG Peat Marwick; Merger Outlook For Accountants,"With merger activity in the accounting profession subsiding, KPMG Peat Marwick remains the world leader with roughly $4.3 billion in revenues for its 1989 fiscal year. Larry D. Horner, KPMG's 55-year-old chairman, was the first to take the plunge almost three years ago when the firm he headed, Peat Marwick Mitchell, paired off with Dutch-based KMG Main Hurdman to expand its reach overseas. In an interview earlier this month, he reflected on the upheaval of the last few months. Q. Will there be more mergers ahead? A. It'll partly be dictated by the success of the current ones. Coopers & Lybrand has no interest in mergers, and we certainly have no interest in a mega-merger. That leaves Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen. I doubt that you'll see another mega-merger. Q. Of the two deals on the table - Ernst & Whinney's merger with Arthur Young, and the Deloitte Haskins & Sells-Touche Ross merger - which will be tougher to pull off? A. Neither one is going to be easy. I would guess Ernst and Young have an easier time. They seem to be further down the road internationally. Q. As you know, Deloitte's British and Dutch affiliates have rejected the merger. How serious a threat is this to the merger ? A. If you follow the basic premise that you go into these mergers to develop a greater global presence and then you begin to lose operations outside of the U.S., you begin to undermine the strategy. I think we have done a better job. We had $2.5 billion in combined revenues starting out in our merger. I think we lost less than $50 million of that. Q. The Securities and Exchange Commission restricts accounting firms from entering into joint ventures or subcontracting with audit clients. Are the restrictions justified, and if not, how would you amend them? A. Independence is very important in audits, but I tend to think its impact on consulting activity has been overplayed. I don't know of any instances where such relationships have led to a bad audit. Therefore loosening the rules would make a great deal of sense. Probably, a materiality test is the way to do it. In the case of the largest accounting firms, if the joint venture were worth several hundred million dollars, it could be material. If it were only worth $25 million, it might not be material. Q. Does it concern you that McKinsey & Company is close to buying the Information Consulting Group, the boutique founded by defectors from Andersen Consulting? A. If they really did it and did it well, it would make them a very strong competitor in information technology. I look at it as a possibly even greater competitor than Andersen. Q. Britain is considering allowing accounting firms to sell up to a 25 percent stake to outsiders. Would KPMG be interested in raising outside funds if the proposal goes forward? A. KPMG was against that. We had not felt it appropriate to have outside shareholders. Our fear is it's hard to control. You begin to get outside shareholders who are not accountants, and that can raise independence issues. Let's say an investment bank ends up owning you that does all sorts of underwriting. The conflicts can become severe. Q. The S.E.C. put sanctions on Peat Marwick in the 1970's because of some bad audits. What do you do today differently as a result, and how do you explain the recent lapses you have had on the audit side of your practice? A. Those weren't Peat Marwick lapses. Wedtech came from Main Hurdman. Sahlen came from Main Hurdman. Crazy Eddie came from Main Hurdman. Regina was ours. I don't think we have any more problems than our competitors. Statistically, you will always get a certain number that go up in smoke. To some extent it reflects the litigious environment in which we work and the complexity of the business environment. Q. What do you see as your firm's competitive advantages? A. Our global capabilities really are unmatched. Frankly, I'm glad we are the biggest, but that could change tomorrow morning. Price Waterhouse and Andersen could come together again. And obviously our competition must think that we have a competitive advantage or they wouldn't be attempting to merge.",1989-10-31T05:00:00+0000
