According to George Valentine, the owner of Four Winds Bait and Tackle Shop in Huntington where the fish was weighed and measured, the catch was one of the largest in an area where striped-bass size has been exceptional this year, including two more than 43 inches in length in the last 10 days. For a boy of 10, the catch is probably a record, but perhaps a curse as well. ''It's the catch of a lifetime,'' Bryan's father, Steve, explained.

us,No Headline,"FRIDAY GRAND SIGHTS Anyone who has ever visited the Grand Canyon has experienced the awesome grandeur of the four-billion-year-old geologic wonder. The beauty and mystery of the canyon have been captured in a half-hour documentary film, ''Grand Canyon: The Hidden Secrets,'' which can be seen this month at the Naturemax Theater at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street. The film was directed by an Academy Award winner, Kieth Merrill, who spent 78 days on location, traveling by foot, mule, horse, raft and helicopter, to gather footage. Among the spectacular views are hidden waterfalls, the white-water rapids of the Colorado River, a mile below the canyon rim, as well as the immense Red Wall Canyon where seventh-century Anasazi Indians lived. The breathtaking scenery is enhanced by Naturemax's screen, which, at 66 feet wide and four stories high, is New York's largest indoor screen. On Friday and Saturday evenings only, a second feature, ''Chronos,'' will be shown. Billed as an unnarrated journey through Western civilization, ''Chronos,'' directed by Ron Fricke, displays time-lapse images of the Acropolis, the Pyramids, the Vatican, Rockefeller Center and other landmarks. Admission is $3.50 for adults, $2.75 for the elderly and $1.75 for children. The double feature is $5.50 for adults, $4.50 for the elderly and $3 for children. For a complete schedule and times, the number is 769-5650. OCEAN COMFORTS Most trans-Atlantic travelers nowadays cross the ocean by plane in a matter of hours. But during the 1920's, ocean liners were the way to go. The expanding postwar economy created a new class of wealthy Americans who paid premium prices to spend many days aboard luxury liners like the Normandie, the Queen Mary and the Rex. An exhibition at the South Street Seaport Museum transports visitors back to the era of these great passenger ships. Called ''The Great Liner: Trans-Atlantic Passage Between the Wars,'' the show depicts life at sea, and features photographs, a partial model of the Normandie, a place setting and glass panels from the Queen Mary, and a ticket agent's counter complete with steamship schedules, travel brochures and posters. The show, produced in cooperation with the Ocean Liner Museum, will run until Jan. 3, and can be seen daily between 10 A.M. and 6 P.M. at the Seaport Museum, 213 Water Street. Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for the elderly and $2 for children under 12. For information, the number is 669-9424. MOSTLY OPERETTA What Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire did for dance on film, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy did for operetta on the silver screen. The incomparable singing duo brought to life many great musicals in films that will be celebrated in a five-week festival, Mostly Operetta, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street. Highlighted will be all the movies the pair made together, including Victor Herbert's ''Naughty Marietta,'' Rodgers and Hart's ''I Married an Angel'' and Sigmund Romberg's ''Girl of the Golden West,'' as well as those in which they appeared separately, such as Franz Lehar's ''Merry Widow,'' with Miss MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier, and Romberg's ''Balalaika,'' with Mr. Eddy and Ilona Massey. Also scheduled are some rare films, including the 1929 ''Rio Rita,'' with music by Harry Tierney and starring Bebe Daniels and John Boles, and a seldom-seen Hitchcock gem from 1933, ''Waltzes From Vienna,'' starring Jessie Matthews and featuring music by Oscar and Johann Strauss. Admission is $5. Today the lineup includes ''The Merry Widow,'' directed by Ernst Lubitsch, 6 P.M.; ''Sweethearts,'' directed by W. S. Van Dyke 2d, 8 P.M., and ''Naughty Marietta,'' also directed by Mr. Van Dyke, 10 P.M. Tomorrow and Sunday those films will be shown at the same times, with another ''Merry Widow,'' directed by Erich von Stroheim, at 4 P.M. The festival will run through Aug. 6. For a complete schedule, the numbers are 598-7150 or 598-7171. SATURDAY 'MEMORIES OF DUKE' Another type of music on film is being celebrated at the Public Theater this month with free weekend showings of Gary Keys's 1980 documentary ''Memories of Duke,'' a tribute to Duke Ellington. When Ellington died in 1974, Leonard Bernstein said he was ''not only a remarkable composer and performer, but was in himself a significant chapter in the history of American music.'' The film follows the composer and band leader on a 1968 tour of Mexico, as he leads his musicians in some of the numbers that were his trademarks: ''Take the A Train,'' ''It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing,'' ''Mood Indigo'' and many others. Among the featured performers are Cootie Williams and Russell Procope, who also share their recollections of Ellington in interviews. The documentary can be seen Saturdays and Sundays at 2 P.M. through Aug. 2 at the Public, 425 Lafayette Street. Free tickets can be picked up at 1 P.M. on the day of the show. Information: 598-7150 or 598-7171. OUTDOOR MUSIC Summer is a time when New York City's parks reverberate with free concerts. One of the oldest participants in the outdoor music scene is the Naumburg Orchestra, which has offered free summer concerts since 1905. The group opens its 82d season Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Damrosch Park Band Shell at Lincoln Center. The program will include the Overture to ''La Gazza Ladra'' by Rossini, Bizet's ''Symphony in C'' and the United States premiere of ''Soldatenspiel,'' a short work by Leo Weiner, a contemporary of Bartok and Kodaly and a teacher of the conductor Sir Georg Solti. The program will conclude with the Third Piano Concerto of Prokofiev, with a guest soloist, Dickran Atamian, the first-prize winner of the 1975 Naumburg Piano Competition. Jens Nygaard, the orchestra's music director, will conduct. Information: 799-1259. REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT What better way to celebrate Independence Day than to relive the city's Revolutionary War history, and what better place than at one of the city's oldest buildings, the Fraunces Tavern Museum? Built in 1719, the tavern is a bastion of history, having served, among other things, as the first offices of the New York Chamber of Commerce in 1768 and the site where George Washington bade farewell to his troops in 1783. Starting this weekend, the museum will house two exhibitions that examine life in late-18th-century America. ''Capital City: New York After the Revolution'' and ''After the Revolution: Everyday Life in America, 1780-1800'' will open on Saturday. The former will be on view for two years and the latter, a traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibition, until Oct. 2. On display will be many historic documents and artworks from the museum's permanent collection, including the only contemporary depiction of Washington's 1789 inauguration - Amos Doolittle's engraving ''Federal Hall -the Seat of Congress'' - swords by Colonial New York sword makers and Thomas Pritchard Rossiter's oil painting ''Signing the Constitution.'' In honor of the Fourth of July, the museum, at 54 Pearl Street, will be open Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Regular hours are Monday through Friday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission on Saturday is by suggested contribution of $2.50. During the week, the museum is free from 10 A.M. to noon, and by contribution afterward. Information: 425-1778. SUNDAY POTPOURRI Calalu is an eastern Caribbean stew made from a potpourri of local ingredients. It is also the name of a 12-piece band that plays music of many styles and ethnic groups. The ensemble will serve as the core group for the third annual free series Musica Para Hot Sundays, which opens this weekend at the Cuando Community Center, 9 Second Avenue, just north of Houston Street. Sponsored by Yomoma Arts Inc., the festival was created to bring together artists from many ethnic backgrounds, or, as one of the series's co-directors, George Agudow, said, to ''reach out to the many communities that make up New York and give musicians a chance to collaborate who otherwise might never get to play together.'' Along with Calalu - which is led by Eric Darton, the festival's other co-director - Sunday's program will include the Devastators, a group of teen-age percussion players directed by Ellen Haag; a jazz violinist, Jason Hwang, and Kwok Mang Ho, an environmental artist. Audience members are encouraged to take their own instruments and join in the music making, which begins at 2 P.M. Information: 675-8189.",1987-07-03T05:00:00+0000

Lou Donaldson is an alto saxophonist and singer who combines the distinctive features of two stars who were prominent in different generations of jazz. His saxophone is fired with memories of Charlie Parker as he flashes through sweeping lines that crackle with the musical fires lighted by Parker in the 1940's. When Mr. Donaldson sings, he retreats two decades to the 1920's where he picks up the conversational vocal style of Don Redman, who brought a glint of humor to his songs with his minimalist approach. However, Mr. Donaldson is constantly challenged within his own group by his pianist, the ebullient Herman Foster, who is so bursting with raw energy and enthusiasm that he seems constantly on the verge of winging right off the bandstand. With Jeff Fuller on bass and Fukisi Tianaka on drums, the quartet plays sets at 9 and 11 tonight through Sunday, with an added show tonight and tomorrow at 12:30 A.M.

Page 1 Moscow plans to cut its work force in industries and farms by up to 20 million people by the end of the century, using layoffs, mergers and a retraining program to streamline industry, a leading Government economist said. 1 Klaus Barbie was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity, the first such conviction in France. The Gestapo chief of wartime Lyons stood motionless as the judge pronounced him guilty on all 341 items of the indictment. 1 Two balloonists jumped to safety as their disabled hot-air balloon went down within sight of the Scottish coast. The men were trying to make the first trans-Atlantic crossing in a hot-air balloon. 1 Opposition leaders warned that they will not negotiate with the South Korean Government on its promised democratic reforms until all political prisoners are freed. 3 Calls for ousting Haiti's Government grew amid new outbreaks of violence. The military Government capitulated on civilian control of elections, but failed to quell the violence. 4 A Cambodian princess holds court in the country's rundown capital, Phnom Penh. Mindful of propaganda, the Communist Government has given her a seat in Parliament and positions in six national organizations. 3 A South African church group has taken steps toward justifying the use of violence by guerrillas fighting to end apartheid rule. The South African Council of Churches endorsed the controversial statement. 28 In Panama, a strike was called by business leaders who said a pro-Government mob set fire to an important commercial complex in the capital Thursday. Many stores closed at midday to show support for the strike. 4 President Reagan's standing in the international community and his ability to achieve an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union have not been undermined by the Iran-contra affair, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said. 2 Eden Pastora is now a fisherman. It is an act of characteristically Biblical resonance by the former Sandinista and contra commander, whose grand gestures always seem more slaying than his battlefield maneuvers. 4 28 still confined in Teheran 2 A call to save tropical forest 28 National 5-7, 33 The survivor from a locked boxcar where 18 men died one by one in heat that probably exceeded 120 degrees told a story that was equal parts extraordinary nightmare and routine saga of life along the nation's border with Mexico. 1 A million dollars for a house?

They were unearthed in a 20-year search throughout the United States and as far away as Northumberland, England. 1 President Reagan will pursue four ''essential economic freedoms'' that would alter Congressional spending and tax policies in the remaining months of his presidency, he pledged. 5 An Air Force official defied an order from the President intended to stop unauthorized disclosures of secret information. A. Ernest Fitzgerald was warned to sign the agreement in 30 days or risk losing his security clearance. 6 Fiscal problems at Operation PUSH, the civil rights group that the Rev. Jesse Jackson has used as his springboard to Presidential politics, may prevent it from being able to continue its work, the group's auditor said. 5 Some B-1 bombers are operational after more than 10 years of dispute and, more recently, problems in development. About half of the 100 bombers scheduled to be delivered by April 1988 have been received. 5 The number of suicides decreases over holidays, according to a California sociologist's study. The study bolsters the belief among many behavior experts that the warnings of holiday suicides have been misplaced. 33 In a dispute over abortion policy, a Federal official said she would challenge her dismissal for refusing to renew grants to Planned Parenthood clinics. 6 N.E.A. president re-elected 5 Doctors hit insurance rates 6 Charges renounced, says Bakker 33 Court date in airline protest 33 Regional 29-32 2,,q>A bill to deregulate the milk industry has been agreed on by Governor Cuomo and the Legislature.

Such concerns, in light of the city's changing economy, have become pressing. 29 Sharpe James's first year in office as Mayor of Newark has helped the city achieve a new-found feeling of hope, many officials and residents believe. But Mr. James still faces serious problems. 30 New York bills on government ethics and accountability approved late Thursday by the State Legislature will not be signed by Governor Cuomo for at least a week, aides to the Governor said. 30 Overcrowding at a Bronx courthouse has caused hardships for judges, juries, lawyers and government agencies. It is agreed that some offices in the Bronx County Courthouse have to move, but there have been no volunteers. 31 News analysis: A panel's proposals could alter the way major municipal agencies conduct business. Some officials say the panel's report on New York City in the year 2000 could lead to changes in public policy, but others are more cautious. 29 Contract talks with trash collectors in New Jersey are focusing on dwindling landfill space and looming changes in trash-disposal methods. The talks are aimed at averting northern New Jersey's third garbage strike in six years. 29 In testimony about a bridge collapse on the Gov. Thomas E.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"MRS. RANDALL. By Christopher T. Leland. (Houghton Mifflin, $16.95.) Christopher Leland's second novel tells the story of the mysterious Mrs. Randall, a young woman with a past she must conceal from the small Southern town of Franksville. We see her through the infatuated eyes of her stepson, Gams Stevenson, whose observations include not only this femme fatale of a mom but all the details of small-town life in the early years of the century. Gams's curiosity deepens during the period of World War I, as the town is convulsed with jingoistic hysteria. When the bloodlust culminates in an act of mob violence against an innocent vagrant, the distraught Mrs. Randall has a miscarriage. Why is she so concerned with the vagrant? What are the details of her hidden past? These questions, and their answers, are unfortunately posed in a decidedly patchy style. Mr. Leland can produce beautifully cadenced prose, capturing, as Gams says, those ''moments . . . when instants grind suddenly slower and all that meets the senses is completely, simultaneously absorbed.'' But too often the author seems to have been stricken by creeping Faulkneritis. Things are always ''lambent'' or ''crepuscular,'' ''ineffable'' or ''unshriven.'' Paired with this precious vocabulary are the other appurtenances of the hillbilly Gothic: incest, patricide and mash whisky. The reader is no less relieved than Gams when he leaves the South for a career in the fledgling movie business as ''Steve Gambit,'' a second-tier contract player; his life (and the novel) then take an unexpected turn. In the end, ''Mrs. Randall'' manages to retain a compelling mystery, even if nearby Yoknapatawpha County casts a long and distracting shadow.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Called ''Untitled Film Stills,'' and depicting the artist dressed up in a variety of guises, these unprepossessing black-and-white images helped usher in a new kind of art for the 80's - the self-conscious, intentionally ambiguous, pop-culture oriented practice that has become known as Postmodernism.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000
us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BEYOND FORGET: Rediscovering the Prairies. By Mark Abley. (Sierra Club Books, $16.95.) Hugh MacLennan, one of Canada's living natural resources, once described his country's literature as ''Boy meets girl in Winnipeg, and who cares?'' More recently, of course, Canadian writers - Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler, Farley Mowat, Alice Munro, Antonine Maillet and Mr. MacLennan himself, among others - have mesmerized millions of readers in many lands. And many Canadians, who have spent so many decades intensely relating to other lands - like Britain, the respected motherland, and the United States, the resented rich cousin - are just now beginning to explore their own country and their relationship to it. In ''Beyond Forget: Rediscovering the Prairies,'' Mark Abley gives an earnest account of his return to the broad Canadian prairies where he grew up, and of his wanderings from Flin Flon, Manitoba, to Forget (pronounced For-jay), Saskatchewan, with numerous stops along the way. This book, the research for which was financed in part by a grant from the Canada Council, is well-meaning. We learn about some interesting historical characters, and we read Mr. Abley's own ruminations, sometimes overwritten - ''I opened the back door onto the long grass and stood for a few minutes watching the implacable sun as it fell to a grapefruit-coloured rumour in the west.'' But his trek, in this first book, is disjointed. Much of it seems pointless. And the cumulative effect is, man meets prairie, and who cares?",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

It was loosened only by the coming of container ships, which require vastly fewer workers to unload.

The second half of March brings the hot dry and often dust-laden khamsin winds from the desert. The winds irritate the eyes, nose and mouth, and almost all parts of Egypt can suffer from them.

This collection of Greek Revival buildings, constructed in the 19th century as a retirement home for seamen, was almost torn down in the 1960's by the home's trustees, who wanted to replace the great row of templelike buildings with a high-rise structure; the city designated the complex a landmark, at which point the trustees went to court. They won a round, then lost a round, and then the city ended up deciding that the best way out was to purchase Snug Harbor as a park and cultural center for Staten Island. Just doing that took five years of difficult negotiations, and they merely ended the curtain raiser: more than 15 years have passed since the city took title, and that has still not been enough time to get all of the buildings, many of which had deteriorated to the point of crumbling, back into shape. * * *",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ENTERTAINING ANGELS: A Guide to Heaven for Atheists and True Believers. By F. Forrester Church. (Harper & Row, $13.95.) Angels, according to G. K. Chesterton, are able to fly ''because they take themselves lightly'' - unlike the devil, who, in F. Forrester Church's words, ''fell on account of his gravity.'' Taking Chesterton's statement as his motto, Mr. Church (the son and biographer of Senator Frank Church and the pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church in Manhattan) has written an extended meditation on the lightness and geniality of angels, a logical sequel to his previous work of popular theology, ''The Devil & Dr. Church.'' An unreconstructed religious liberal, Mr. Church defines angels not as odd creatures with wings, but as ''little epiphanies of the divine amidst the ordinary.'' Angels can be distinguished by ''a touch of irony, a dash of anarchy''; they allow us to stand back from the deadening routine of modern living. As such, they have little to do with the often silly and unpleasant formulations of traditionalists, surveyed at length in Mr. Church's delightful chapter ''Heaven as Hell'' (Billy Graham's combat metaphors, for example, which depict angels as ''God's dynamite'' set against ''Satan's BB guns''). As long as Mr. Church exhibits the lightness and irony he admires in angels, his book remains airborne. Occasionally, however, ''Entertaining Angels'' becomes burdened with platitudes and pop commonplaces: ''The divisions within us spring from negative self-attitude based on experience.'' In these passages, the author demonstrates that the opposite of an angel is sometimes not necessarily a devil, but a ponderous preacher.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"OPEN ROAD: A Celebration of the American Highway, by Phil Patton. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $7.95.) Phil Patton's account of highway history is an ''intriguing'' and ''lovely little book,'' Karal Ann Marling said in The Book Review in 1986. The author deals with nostalgic roadside America as well as with ''roadways as expressive entities in their own right.'' But he is at his best, she said, on the subject of ''the mighty interstate, the coast-to-coast system of divided highways begun in earnest under President Eisenhower on the utopian model of the German Autobahn.'' BABY, IT'S COLD INSIDE, by S. J. Perelman. (Penguin, $6.95.) Parody is a nearly lost art, Eudora Welty said in The Book Review in 1970, and ''the only writer I know who can save it is the author of this book.'' In a collection of 32 pieces, most of them originally published in The New Yorker in the 1960's, S. J. Perelman sends up Joycean scholarship (''Anna Trivia Pluralized''), the humiliation of the American tourist in London (''Let a Snarl Be Your Umbrella'') and the medical profession in the person of Dr. Morris Prognose and his ''sumptuous'' assistant, Miss Bustanoby. The same publisher has reissued two more Perelman collections ($6.95 each). THE RISING GORGE displays ''a profound gift for derangement (or a gift for profound derangement),'' Gilbert Millstein said here in 1961. Subjects include a correspondence with the Busy Bee Cleaners, entitled ''Eine Kleine Mothmusik.'' THE SWISS FAMILY PERELMAN, a book of voyages including illustrations by Al Hirschfeld, is ''a gallimaufry of harrowing descriptions of battles with the elements, and with merchants, waiters, fellow-passengers, Mrs. Perelman, and customs officials, to name a few,'' Rex Lardner said here in 1950. THE MIND OF A MNEMONIST: A Little Book About a Vast Memory, by A. R. Luria. (Harvard University, $7.95.) The Soviet psychologist Aleksandr R. Luria (1902-77) describes the life and personality of a man (known as ''S'') who was found to have a literally limitless memory and whose burden was that he was able to forget things only by an act of will. In 1968, one reviewer said the work had an ''almost Kafka-like quality,'' and another found it ''fascinating and delightful.'' The same publisher has reissued THE MAN WITH A SHATTERED WORLD: The History of a Brain Wound ($7.95), Luria's study of a young soldier who suffers a catastrophic head injury and has to relearn almost everything. In 1973 one reviewer called it an intriguing and ''valuable review of the strange but precise working of the brain.'' Both are translated by Lynn Solotaroff. SOCIAL DISEASE, by Paul Rudnick. (Ballantine, $6.95.) Guy Huber and his fashionable wife, Venice, loft-living darlings of the club scene, have been voted one of the 10 most visible couples in New York, but tragedy strikes when Guy's parents insist he get a job. While Paul Rudnick's satirical first novel sometimes strains too hard for its one-liners, Emily Listfield said here last year, ''there are some good laughs to be had'' and the author has ''a fine ear for conversational parody.'' A MALE CHILD, by Paul Scott. (Carroll & Graf, $3.95.) His marriage over and his health broken, Ian Canning returns to postwar England from service in India and is rescued by a friend who invites him to his family's summer home. ''The most striking and vital feature'' of Paul Scott's novel, Isabelle Mallet said here in 1957, ''is its dialogue, which is excellent, believable and economical. Some of the book reads like a lively, well-constructed play.'' WORLDLY POWER: The Making of The Wall Street Journal, by Edward E. Scharff. (Plume/New American Library, $9.95.) This history of the nation's business daily and its place in American journalism is ''a spirited, highly readable narrative'' and the first book ''to come close to doing the modern Journal justice,'' reviewers said in 1986. Another publisher, St. Martin's, has reissued TRADING SECRETS: Seduction and Scandal at The Wall Street Journal, by R. Foster Winans ($4.95), the former Journal columnist convicted on insider-trading charges after leaking advance information from his ''Heard on the Street'' column. ''Mr. Winans tells us how humiliated he feels and how sorry he is for his deeds,'' Joanne B. Ciulla said here last year, ''yet the reader never really believes him and neither, apparently, did the judge.'' A DARK-ADAPTED EYE, by Barbara Vine. (Bantam, $6.95.) Barbara Vine (a k a Ruth Rendell) weaves a tale of obsession and mayhem as her heroine explores a bygone crime - the brutal murder for which her Aunt Vera was hanged three decades earlier. ''Rendell/Vine does a masterful job of unpeeling the layers of this grim, sad tale,'' one reviewer said in 1986. THE NEMESIS AFFAIR: A Story of the Death of Dinosaurs and the Ways of Science, by David M. Raup. (Norton, $6.95.) David Raup, a paleontologist and a professor of geophysical sciences, explores the theory of periodic mass extinctions, a scenario in which comets colliding with the earth wiped out prehistoric species at regular intervals of some 26 million years. The author's account of the evolution of the theory, Jonathan Weiner said in The Book Review last year, is ''clear, low-key and good-humored.'' MAYFLOWER MADAM: The Secret Life of Sydney Biddle Barrows, by Sydney Biddle Barrows with William Novak. (Ivy Books, $4.95.) The blue-blooded author shares her experiences running a tony ''escort service'' and later being charged with promoting prostitution. Florence King said in The Book Review last year that Sydney Biddle Barrows ''offers a highly explicit but tastefully written view from the 50-yard line of what may well be the only lull in the battle of the sexes.''",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE MUSIC: Reflections on Jazz and Blues. By Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and Amina Baraka. (Morrow, $22.95.) Before changing his name to Amiri Baraka, the poet and playwright LeRoi Jones had established himself as an eloquent jazz critic; his 1963 study, ''Blues People: Negro Music in White America,'' is a classic. ''The Music,'' which includes warm, jazz-inspired verse by his wife Amina and poetry, essays and a play on the subject of music and musicians by Mr. Baraka himself, constitutes another chapter in his intellectual odyssey. No one doubts his ideological convictions, but those who cherish the music yearn for his old expository talents. There's nothing wrong with a political edge to music commentary, but in these pages jazz and blues epiphanies suffer the weight of endless references to racism and monopoly capitalism. A politically impassioned artist like Gil Scott-Heron is lionized, yet we learn little about the true nature of his craft and gain no more than a glimpse into the personality of a man whose message has carried, despite the times. Such praise songs and political cant give the book itself a racist tone. This is sad in view of the author's musical insights, for there is a strength to Mr. Baraka's excavations of the roots of modern forms. In the essay ''The Phenomenon of Soul in African-American Music,'' for example, he perceptively focuses on jazzmen like Horace Silver, Clifford Brown and ''others [ who ] went back to the wellspring of black music, the African-American church.''",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000
us,William Penn Mott Jr.: Searching for the Right Balance,"THE long-held philosophy of the National Park Service - maintain the parks as much as possible as ''a vignette of primitive America'' - has come under increasing attack. Critics charge that a lack of active intervention in natural systems within the parks has led to a serious decline in animal species such as the mule deer of Yellowstone. Some critics also contend that the parks have been marred by an overemphasis on tourism and an underemphasis on broader problems such as development of lands adjacent to the parks. Some of the most stinging charges have come from Alston Chase, a former teacher of philosophy at Princeton who lives in Montana and who wrote ''Playing God in Yellowstone.'' William Penn Mott Jr. is director of the National Park Service. Philip Shabecoff, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, talked with them last week.

To refresh my memory, as they say in Washington, I played it through and found it still bracingly brash and inventive. Both the braininess and the stylistic nostalgia that I remembered were there. However, I was able to recapture little of an earlier excited feeling of being in the presence of a great new work - a masterpiece, to use a word that went out of style when the Victor dog was a pup. The letdown should not have surprised me - desperately few pieces from that disturbed decade retain any sort of shine today - but it did set me thinking about the evanescent qualities that persuade a listener to value one musical work more highly than another.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

To a degree, their fears were understandable, since it had taken decades for many treasurable 78 r.p.m. recordings to find homes on LP. And with sonic purity now a selling point, it seemed likely that many older recordings were marked for extinction. Still, most record companies understood that buyers would want a mixture of fully digital disks and analogue classics. And they quickly realized that CD reissues could be big business - that there was a demand for them, and that they were extremely profitable. Their production costs, after all, had long since been amortized. And although many catalogue items had already descended into the mid-price and budget realms on LP, the CD's could be sold at full price. Many labels decreed that any recording with a respectable sales history in its vinyl life would rise again on CD.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Brightly colored glassware, which has been popular since the invention of blown glass in the first century B.C., is one solution. Early glass was always faintly colored - either green or brown, depending on the amount of iron. But since these shades were not considered pleasing, glass was deliberately decorated or colored in stronger tones, until the Venetian glassmakers of the 15th century discovered that oxide of manganese would decolor and clarify glass, making it completely transparent. Even with the invention of clear glass, colored tableware has remained popular. During different periods, some colors have been more common than others. In America, during the 18th and early 19th centuries, for instance, blue, amber, green and purple were considered fashionable. Later, as the Victorians embraced colors and textures in design, ruby and pink glassware began appearing in households. Today, in the right setting, any color goes.",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

As Allison's Buick crossed the finish line 1.5 seconds ahead of Baker's Oldsmobile in the 160-lap race, Ken Schrader and Harry Gant, both of whom were running with the leaders, crashed hard. After Schrader's car was tapped in the rear by Dave Marcis it went sideways and started up the banking, did a complete barrel roll, slammed into Gant's and knocked both cars into the wall. Both cars slid to a stop just past the finish line. Neither driver was injured. Meanwhile, Allison, 49 years old, came up with his third Firecracker 400 victory and the 83rd triumph of his Nascar career.

Some critics also contend that the parks have been marred by an overemphasis on tourism and an underemphasis on broader problems such as development of lands adjacent to the parks.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"GWEN JOHN. By Susan Chitty. (Franklin Watts, $17.95.) Gwen John (1876-1939) was an English painter, the older sister of the better-known painter Augustus John. From this account, she appears to have been an eccentric, driven woman who led an unusual, principled and self-punishing life. When, early in her career, her father told her she looked like a prostitute in a painting - she worked as an artist's model - she refused ever again to take money from him, in effect choosing poverty for life. She traveled in France with another woman, earning money by sketching men in bars. Rodin was her lover for more than 10 years, and when his passion for her dulled and he took up with another, she contented herself with whatever attention he gave her. Through it all, she painted and drew, mostly women or domestic or interior scenes, often repeating the same subject in a series and refusing, on principle, to produce work for exhibition. While Susan Chitty, whose other books include biographies of Charles Kingsley and Anna Sewell, has done her research and provided a chronology of John's art production, this book fails to hold our interest. It merely presents the data, in a bewildering, almost comic prose style (''In all that crowd not one person spoke to her. Of all those footsteps not one stopped to say a kind word''). Gwen John's work and life await future writers - ones familiar, for example, with feminist theory, who will not be surprised, as was Susan Chitty, that ''there have been flattering references to [ Gwen John ] in several recent books . . . all of them, oddly enough, by women.''",1987-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Even though America, after the Camp David peace accords, became a principal source of arms for Egypt, co-producing the M-1 makes little sense either for Cairo or Washington. The M-1 embodies almost everything the U.S. Army knows about how to make tanks. None have yet been sold abroad. Letting the tanks be assembled in Egypt will inevitably hasten leakage of the secrets of their construction. The M1-A1, the latest version of the M-1, has a more powerful gun designed to defeat improved Soviet tanks that have not yet even been fielded. It is foolish for America to export its most advanced arms to countries that don't need them. Egypt plans to build 1,000 or more M1-A1's. Against whom are they to be deployed? America has no desire to see them used against Israel. As for Libya, Chad convincingly demonstrated last March at Wadi Doum that antitank missiles mounted on jeeps suffice to defeat Libyan tank forces.

The Justice Department at first opposed the $80 million bid, saying that combining the nation's only two national bus systems could raise serious anti-competitive problems. Later, however, it found that the acquisition was necessary because Trailways was on the brink of bankruptcy. Fred G. Currey, the chairman and president of Greyhound and a past president of Trailways, discusses the competitive effects of his company's bid. Q. Must Trailways be taken over quickly? A.

North said he never had a discussion with President Reagan about the use of profits from the sales of American weapons to Iran for the purpose of assisting the Nicaraguan rebels. But he assumed the President had ''authorized'' such use of the profits. Secret memorandums: a0> Colonel North said he wrote ''as many as five'' memorandums describing the Iran arms sales and seeking Mr. Reagan's approval for diversion of profits to the contras. But he said he never saw ''a single document which gave me a clear indication'' that the President had given his approval. In any event, he said, ''I think I shredded most'' of the memorandums. Shredding: Colonel North said there was no ''horrible, final, last-minute, last-ditch shredding'' of documents just before Justice Department officials began to investigate his activities in late November 1986. Rather, he said, he began shredding documents ''in earnest'' in early October 1986, when his covert operations began ''unraveling.'' False chronology: Colonel North said he knew, while preparing a chronology of the Iran-contra affair in early November 1986, that it contained false information. The inaccurate data, he said, came from Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser, and he said other senior officials also knew it contained falsehoods. Meese's knowledge: Colonel North said Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d was aware of the shipment of 18 Hawk antiaircraft missiles from Israel to Iran at about the time of the shipment in November 1985. However, Mr. Meese has said he did not learn of the shipment until nearly a year later. North's obedience: Colonel North said he ''never carried out a single act'' for which he did not have authority from his superiors. In 23 years in the armed services, he said, he never ''violated an order, not one.''",1987-07-08T05:00:00+0000

It would be insufferable as an operetta, too, if not for a handful of beautiful tunes that probe, indefinably, what the book ignores, and enact what the book merely indicates.

us,North vs. Others: A Sample of the Conflicts,"ISSUE: ARMS SHIPMENT - One of the most important questions facing the committee is the nature of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3rd's weekend fact-finding mission last November. Mr. Meese was present when Colonel North proposed that William J. Casey, the late Director of Central Intelligence, make the false statement to Congress that no one in the Government knew about the Iran arms shipment of November 1985. Colonel North said Mr. Meese knew the truth within weeks. NORTH'S TESTIMONY - ''I do remember discussions which included the Attorney General subsequent to this event. I believe there was one that Mr. McFarlane referred me to in December... One of the issues that had already come up by then was a draft finding prepared in concert with Mr. Sporkin who was at the time the general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. I was led to believe or at least came to believe in 1985 that Mr. Sporkin had gotten the acquiescence or spport - either he or Director Casey - of the Attorney General in that November finding. The November finding specifically referred to prior actions.'' OTHERS' ACCOUNTS: Meese statement, released by his spokesman today - ''As to the arms shipments that took place prior to 1986, he did not learn about these until November 1986. The Attorney General was in no way involved with the November 1985 ''finding'' drafted by C.I.A. general consel Stanley Sporkin. . . . In fact, he did not know of any such November 1985 finding until a year later, in November 1986.'' ISSUE: CHRONOLOGIES - Another key issue is who ordered the falsification of chronologies to be used by the White House in presenting the Iran arms sales story. Colonel North attributes inaccurate statements about the November shipment to Robert C. McFarlane, the former National Security Adviser. NORTH'S TESTIMONY - ''As I indicated earlier, I had gotten that language from Mr. McFarlane.'' Q. So you got the language from McFarlane. He persuaded you it was appropriate to put it in. You put it in. A. Who is ''he?'' Q. McFarlane. A. Yes. OTHERS' ACCOUNTS - Mr. McFarlane testified that he assisted Colonel North in preparing the chronologies and that he acquiesed in some language prepared by others that he knew was ''technically wrong.'' He said, however, that it was Colonel North who directed the efforts of four to five people. He quoted Colonel North as saying: ''It looks to me like what we're putting together here will assure that the President isn't hurt by this.'' ISSUE: CARGO PLANE - The Reagan Admnistration repeatedly told the public and Congress that it had no connection with the cargo plane. Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, said this was because he had made a honest error and had not been told of Colonel North's role in the operation. NORTH'S TESTIMONY - Did he [ Abrams ] ask you whether you or the N.S.C. had any conn",1987-07-09T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CHEZ JOSEPHINE, 414 West 42d Street (594-1925) - *(Oct. 31, 1986) Finding a spot to enjoy good music and good food in the same setting can be a problem in New York City, but the options are widening. This restaurant's delightfully racy decor leitmotif finds the sultry singer Josephine Baker in various stages of scanty dress - on the walls, on the menu cover and on the bathroom doors. Tuesday through Sunday evenings Lloyd Henderson and Lillette Jenkins, singers and pianists, provide the entertainment. The menu is French-American, and starter options include the house pate with onion puree; leeks in tomato vinaigrette, and deep-fried oysters with puree of fennel with lime.

us,WEEKENDER GUIDE,"FRIDAY CLASSICS, LIGHTENED Classical music - with a twist or two - comes to the Prospect Park Band Shell for the second weekend of the Celebrate Brooklyn performing-arts series. Paquito D'Rivera, a jazz saxophonist, will join the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of David Amram, for a program called ''From Mozart to Monk'' tonight at 8. Tomorrow night at 8, Marisa Galvany, a soprano, and Harry Theyard, a tenor, will offer arias and duets from assorted operas, with Anton Coppola conducting. A lesser-known classical tradition will be presented Sunday evening at 8 by Jim Pepper and other Indian singers and dancers from Oklahoma. A $1 donation is requested. The band shell is near Prospect Park West and Ninth Street. In case of rain, the two Philharmonic concerts will be held in the Prospect Park Picnic House, near Prospect Park West and Third Street; the rain date for the Jim Pepper performance is Monday. Information: (718) 768-0699. UNION SQUARE AFLOWER Union Square Park, in the not-too-distant past a hangout for drug dealers and derelicts, has been spruced up considerably, and to celebrate its renewal, it will be blooming with flowers and entertainment for the next week. The first Union Square Park Full Bloom Festival begins today at 11 A.M. with a potpourri of jazz and juggling, comedy and tap dancing. The festival continues with the square's weekly Greenmarket tomorrow, and a concert of jazz, Caribbean and Asian music on Sunday at 2 P.M. And what flower festival would be complete without flowers? Thousands of marigolds, zinnias, roses and other colorful flora have been planted along the park's paths and around the statues of Washington, Lafayette and Lincoln. The fair continues through Thursday. The park is at 14th Street and Broadway; the number for information is 397-3177. TRAVELING VICARIOUSLY Armchair travelers have the opportunity to journey to Argentina, Brazil and other points south -all without leaving New York - thanks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum begins a four-week, Friday-evening series of lighthearted travel-adventure films called ''Getting Away From It All,'' tonight at 8. The series begins with Irving Cummings's 1940 comedy ''Down Argentine Way,'' with Betty Grable and Carmen Miranda, and will be followed by ''That Night in Rio,'' ''A Weekend in Havana'' and ''Moon Over Miami.'' Films will be shown in the museum's Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, near the Fifth Avenue and 83d Street entrance. Tickets are $4, or $14 for the series. Information: 570-3949. SATURDAY BOTANICAL SHAKESPEARE Shakespeare seems to be popping up all over town this summer, and the Bard's newest venue will be the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where ''The Taming of the Shrew'' is to be presented Saturday at 2:30 P.M. Additional performances are scheduled for subsequent Saturdays, July 18 and 25, and another Shakespeare comedy, ''All's Well That Ends Well,'' is to be performed on Sundays, this weekend, July 19 and July 26, at 2:30 P.M. Both plays are being done by the King's Men of the Kings County Shakespeare Company, a four-year-old Brooklyn-based theater company under the direction of Deborah Wright Houston. Performances are free and will be held outdoors at the Alfred T. White Memorial. Mats will be provided for the grass surrounding the stage. In case of rain, the actors move indoors to the garden's auditorium. The 50-acre garden is at 1000 Washington Avenue, and admission is free. Weekend hours are 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Information: (718) 622-4433. STATELY HOMES TOUR For the last 40 years, it has been a midsummer tradition in Litchfield, Conn., for historic houses to open their doors to visitors. This year's Litchfield Open House Tour is to be held Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. in the village and nearby Milton. Five houses and several churches in the area, as well as the Litchfield Historical Society Museum and the Tapping Reeve House and Law School - said to be the country's first law school -will be included on the tour. Among the homes to be shown are the 1774 farmhouse called ''Goose Landing''; the 205-year-old Guild Tavern, which was once a gathering-place for thirsty travelers along the Hartford-Albany turnpike, and a modern house designed by Marcel Breuer. Tickets for the self-guided tour are $10, and registration will be held Saturday morning on the Litchfield Green beginning at 10. Information: (203) 567-9423. LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC Like many folk-music traditions, jibaro - the music of Puerto Rico's mountains - is a hybrid form with several cultural roots. Two concerts of this lyrical, Spanish-derived folk music will be presented Saturday afternoon in the Kaufman Theater of the American Museum of Natural History. Sexteto Criollo Puertorriqueno performs at 2 and 4 P.M., and Antonio Ramirez, an artisan born in Puerto Rico, will demonstrate the art of making cuatros -the guitarlike instrument used in most jibaro performances - at 1 and 3 P.M. in the museum's Blum Lecture Room. Another type of Puerto Rican music can be heard Sunday at 2 P.M. in Tompkins Square Park, at Seventh Street between Avenues A and B. The concert of African-influenced songs by Los Pleneros de la 21 will be preceded by a demonstration of how bomba drums are made. Additional concerts in the East Village park are to be presented on three succeeding Sundays. The rain date for all concerts is Aug. 9. The performances are part of the citywide series Musica Tradicional 1987, devoted to the musical heritage of Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic and sponsored by City Lore: The New York Center for Urban Folk Culture. The concerts are free, although the suggested admission to the museum -on Central Park West between 77th and 81st Streets - is $3.50 for adults and $1.50 for children. Information: 529-1955 or 769-5315. LOOKING BACKWARD Time travel has long been a popular fantasy, and this Saturday and Sunday, at least a semblance of that fantasy can be realized at Richmondtown Restoration on Staten Island. The first of three weekends of 19th-century American feasts are planned at the parklike, 96-acre complex of restored 17th- to 19th-century buildings. These historical repasts will feature menus, costumes and entertainment that would have been typical for a large, rural, middle-class gathering about 150 years ago. The festivities begin with 4 o'clock self-guided tours of the grounds, followed by wine, cider and biscuits served at 5 P.M. Diners will be seated at outdoor tables (weather permitting) about 6 for an evening of food and revelry. The menu includes spit-roasted rounds of roast beef, freshly churned butter and homemade preserves, and brick-oven-baked breads and pies. Musicians will perform ballads and bawdy songs, and games of the period will be played after dinner. Feasts are to be held also on July 25 and 26 and Aug. 8 and 9 at the restoration, which is at 441 Clarke Avenue, near Arthur Kill and Richmond Roads. The cost is $30 a person and reservations are required. Information: (718) 351-1617. SUNDAY NEW YORK AS A FILM SET New York City has often been called the greatest back lot in the world, and indeed, thousands of film makers have used the city's streets and buildings, parks and shops as settings for their movies. The New-York Historical Society will screen eight films this summer with settings in or near the city and, in two cases, upstate. One upstate setting will come in the first film, John Ford's ''Drums Along the Mohawk,'' which will be shown this Sunday at 2 P.M. The 1939 tale about Revolutionary War-era New York State will be followed on Sunday afternoons by such classic films as ''Heaven Can Wait'' (1943), ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957) and ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961). The films are free with museum admission, which is $2 for adults, $1.50 for the elderly and $1 for children. Continuing exhibitions at the society include the Neustadt collection of Tiffany lamps, paintings by Hudson River School artists and the Wagstaff silver collection. This weekend is the last chance to see the show on Jackie Robinson. The museum, at 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, is open from 1 to 5 P.M. on Sundays, and from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Information: 873-3400. FEAST OF THE GIGLIO Imagine an 85-foot, 8,000-pound pyramid complete with a 15-piece band, carried by 100 men down the streets of Brooklyn. This otherworldly scene, which has been enacted for generations, is known as the dancing of the Giglio, and is one of the highlights of an annual Italian street festival in the borough's Williamsburg section, sponsored by Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church. The Giglio will be accompanied by a procession at 1 P.M. on Sunday near Havemeyer and North Eighth Streets, carrying an oversized rowboat honoring St. Paulinus, who returned to Italy in just such a one after his African captivity ended. The Giglio festivities are named for the flower - the lily - that were strewn to welcome him back. The 17-day feast, which also celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Brooklyn church, continues through July 19, and includes rides, games and countless stands selling Italian foods and gifts. On Sunday, the fair will run all afternoon and evening; weekday hours are about 7 P.M. to midnight. Information: (718) 384-0223.",1987-07-10T05:00:00+0000

The 1.9 million tons estimated this year is the same tonnage California growers actually harvested in 1984. A spokesman said the lighter crop was generally because of the damaging heat spell during May, when grape vines were in the delicate bloom stage.",1987-07-11T05:00:00+0000

Casey, as Director of Central Intelligence, wanted to establish a ''stand alone'' fund that could pay for intelligence operations outside normal government control. Page 1 Americans believe Colonel North by an overwhelming margin. A New York Times/CBS News Poll found that most Americans say they believe that he is telling the truth about the Iran-contra affair and that President Reagan is lying. 1 Legislators erupted in frustration and anger, lashing out at their own lawyers and sniping at each other, as the popularity of Colonel North has grown and the Congressmen have been cast as the villains. 1 The duel between the lawyers at the Iran-contra hearings is part courtroom drama, part theater and part genuine exposition of the facts, all of which has attracted the interest of legal experts. 8 The special prosecutor's authority to investigate the Iran-contra affair and to enforce a grand jury subpoena against Colonel North was upheld by a Federal Judge. 8 Support and cash for Colonel North are pouring in from across the country. Contributions to his defense fund continue to mount, and money is also flowing to Colonel North's favorite cause: the contras in Nicaragua. 5 Contacts between Moscow and Bonn may grow after the six-day visit to the Soviet Union by the West German President, Richard von Weizsacker, West German officials and Western diplomats said. 3 Moscow has slowed arms talks and preparations for a summit meeting, the Administration said. But officialssaid they did not believe the slowdown threatened a new arms-control agreement on medium- and short-range missiles. 3 Military links with Cambodia by the Vietnamese will be kept even if Vietnam adheres to its announced intention to withdraw its troops in 1990, a Communist diplomat in close touch with Vietnam's views suggested. 2 South Koreans' demands have grown as they test the limits of democracy. But the demands may be more than President Chun Doo Hwan bargained for when he accepted a democratization package, and the military's patience may be wearing thin. 3 A trade measure was approved by the Senate that is designed to require the Administration to take action against countries, such as Japan, that consistently deny access to American products. 39 Thais say Laos turns to marijuana to aid budget 2 U.N. group meets amid anxiety 2 Asuncion journal 4 Unions a nonissue in Australian vote 4 Sagging economy affects New Zealand election 4 A Haiti vacation ends in a plane crash 4 National 10-12, 32 2,4.4,q>The Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in June, the Government said. It was the second small advance in as many months, and it continued to allay fears that the inflation rate was about to jump. 1 After two jets nearly collided over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday, suggestions were made by radio to the crew of a Continental Airlines jumbo jet that they refrain from reporting the incident, officials said. 1 Alan Greenspan will avoid decisions that affect J.P. Morgan & Company if he is named chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, according to a document he has submitted to the White House and Congress. 1 Some doctors require AIDS tests of their patients and are refusing to care for carriers of the virus. The medical community is divided in a debate over whether this is in keeping with the profession's ethical responsibilities. 1 A landlord will live with vermin for 30 days in an infested apartment building for failing to improve conditions in four buildings he owned. The Beverly Hills neurosurgeon will begin serving his sentence on Monday. 10 Officials violated free-speech rights of protesters at a public ceremony on the Mall in Philadelphia honoring the Constitution's bicentennial last May 25, a Federal judge ruled. 10 At the Young Republican convention, the nearly 800 delegates who have gathered make it plain that they are looking to the past with considerable wistfulness, and facing the future with some uneasiness. 11 The campaign for women's votes by the Democratic Presidential candidates is markedly different from that of their counterparts in 1984, and has stirred complaints from some women that feminism is being neglected by the party. 10 Heart disease and physical inactivity may have a link as strong as the links between heart disease and smoking or high blood pressure, Federal health officials said, following a two-year analysis. 10 3 police officers slain in Michigan 11 U.S. restricts satellite licenses 11 Dukakis approves AIDS testing 12 5 workers killed in fall at San Diego shipyard 12 Judge withdraws as candidate to head F.B.I. 32 Regional 33-36 2,3.2,q>People who are arrested face delays as New York City shuffles them from one criminal justice location to another. The toll of the process, which a Federal judge has ruled must be quicker, is paid by prisoners. 33 A garbage barge's odyssey is ending. New York City agreed to burn its 3,100-ton load from the barge at an incinerator in Brooklyn. 33 News analysis: The court decision about a state statute designed to protect journalists' sources and materials from subpoena offered a glimpse into how judges can make new law by interpreting statutes in ways that legislators never intended. 35 A drug treatment center for parents allows them to live with their children while they complete a program of counseling, group therapy and peer support. The center, Odyssey House, is on Wards Island. 33 Pushing to end the legislative session in Albany, state lawmakers reached agreement on a renewal of New York City's J-51 real estate tax abatement program, state economic development initiatives, and a range of other issues. 35 A judge who gave teachers jail terms for defying his order to end an illegal strike is surprised by the fuss about the sentences. Judge Paul R. Huot sentenced 110 Lyndhurst teachers and other school workers to jail. 34 Competing to be ''Mr. Wall Street,'' seven businessmen strutted and flexed in a body-building contest at Pier 11 near the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan. 35 The talk of the Hamptons 33 Cyclists fault limited use of bridge 34 Move toward milk price rise 35 New York bills affecting citizens 35",1987-07-11T05:00:00+0000

This is the kind of theatrical vacuum one expects to find on West 45th Street, but not near Piccadilly Circus, where even plays with poor reviews and large casts have been known to linger for an entire season. Was London at last succumbing to the hit-or-flop mentality of the Great White Way?

Like so much literary debate, it is most interesting for what it deflects. That is to say, it is very American, and very contemporary, to see this as an esthetic issue, refusing to consider literature as taking place in a larger social and cultural framework, of literature having reference at all. (Am I alone, in reading the reviews in these pages, in feeling that the fiction - and social, political, and cultural nonfiction - seems not to be written by contemporaries in different genres, but by people from different planets? And more, that it seems a mark of intellectual distinction never to review the fiction in the context of the culture?)

us,"EROS MAKES WAR By Isabel Allende. Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. 274 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.    FEW literary legends can compare to that surrounding ''The House of the Spirits,'' Isabel Allende's family-chronicle-cum-history of her native Chile. Her very first novel, published when she was in her early 40's, rose to best-sellerdom. Reviewers were indulgent. Here was a beautiful, humane, talented woman who happened to be the exiled niece of the martyred Chilean President Salvador Allende. The troublesome secret was that in prose and format the book was mostly imitation Garcia Marquez.   Happily, Ms. Allende is no longer the novice in ''Of Love and Shadows,'' a suspenseful thriller. Set in the terrorized Chile of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (himself an occasional character), it tells of the love that grows between Irene Beltran - feisty, innocent, marginally upper-class and a reporter for a women's magazine - and Francisco Leal, son of impoverished Spanish Republican exiles, an unemployed psychologist and sometime political activist who casually drifts into Irene's office as a freelance photographer. Together they cover a variety of beats, but something clicks when they start investigating Evangelina, a 15-year-old peasant girl and fabled miracle worker. During a brutal army search of her family's house, Evangelina, in a trance, singlehandedly lifts up a cruel lieutenant and hurls him out the door.   Soon thereafter Evangelina ''disappears''; through journalistic tips and footwork the hero and heroine locate the girl's corpse in an abandoned mine shaft, where bodies of dozens of the regime's opponents are also decaying. Francisco takes photos; word spreads; a scandal ensues. Then someone sprays Irene with bullets from a passing car. She survives in the hospital but is obviously marked for Government liquidation. With help from friends she and Francisco assume disguises, quietly flee Santiago and cross the Andes into Argentina, ready to fight the dictatorship from exile. ''We will return,'' they say. LOVE and struggle a la ''Casablanca'' - it's all there. Ms. Allende skillfully evokes both the terrors of daily life under military rule and the subtler forms of resistance in the hidden corners and ''shadows'' of her title, particularly in the churches or in simple unsung acts of solidarity. At the same time the author ably captures the voices of the regime's apologists - the complex lies and cliches of its proud male foot soldiers and the pat false phrases of its rich lady cheerleaders. A journalist herself, Ms. Allende renders with expert detail such offbeat worlds as the professional routines of a hairdresser, the range of types in a private nursing home or the operations of the Santiago city morgue. While her prose at times verges on soap opera, that is also one of its charms. She can just as deftly depict loving tenderness as convey the high fire of eroticism. And when you've successfully mingled sex and politics with a noble cause, how can you go wrong?   While the translation by Margaret Sayers Peden is at times awkward (for example, ''pythoness'' and ''chiromancy'' instead of ''fortune teller'' and ''palmistry'') and could use more colloqualisms and contractions, on the whole it's a supple piece of work.",OF LOVE AND SHADOWS,1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTER: And Other Stories, by Rose Tremain. (Owl/Holt, $7.95.) On the surface portraits of British decorum, Rose Tremain's characters harbor ''feelings of jealousy, anger, vengeance and loss, emotions so intense they constantly threaten to break through to the surface,'' Caryn James said in The Book Review in 1984. ''These may look like Barbara Pym people, but they are bitter from years of keeping a stiff upper lip. . . . Always there is a sense of impending psychic violence; this tension . . . gives the stories their originality and power.'' HOME: A Short History of an Idea, by Witold Rybczynski. (Penguin, $7.95.) This widely praised study of com-fort and domesticity and their meaning in our lives treats such subjects as intimacy and privacy, cleanliness, light and air, efficiency, style and substance. The author's ''defense of common comfort is a good one,'' William H. Gass said here last year, ''for between the polemical beginning and ending of his argument there is a book of great interest and instruction. . . . He tells the story of the development of the private dwelling from house to home, and he does it in a sensitive and balanced way.'' And he ''is particularly good at describing the effects . . . of invention - whether water closet, gas jet, electric lamp, window sash or whatever.'' SELECTED STORIES, by Robert Walser. Translated by Christopher Middleton and others. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) These tales by the Swiss-born Robert Walser (1878-1956), who spent some 27 years in mental institutions, are ''to be read slowly and savored,'' Ronald De Feo said here in 1982, for they make up a volume, by a ''self-styled exile,'' that is ''filled with lovely and disturbing moments that will stay with the reader for some time to come.'' ENTRANCES: An American Director's Journey, by Alan Schneider. (Limelight, $17.95.) This posthumously published memoir by the theatrical director Alan Schneider (1917-84) is an ''outstandingly valuable, extremely well-written and excitingly readable autobiography,'' our reviewer, Martin Esslin, said last year. Schneider was most closely associated with the works of Edward Albee, Harold Pinter and especially Samuel Beckett (a memorable episode is Schneider's account of the doomed American premiere of ''Waiting for Godot,'' which opened in Miami, billed as ''the laugh sensation of two continents,'' starring Bert Lahr and Tom Ewell). SATURDAY NIGHT AT SAN MARCOS, by William Packard. (Grove, $7.95.) William Packard's novel, a satire on the world of writers' conferences, is fast and fun, portraying the writing industry with ''a sharp yet loving bite,'' Regina Weinreich said in The Book Review in 1986. ''Picture the pace of Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road' plus caricature worthy of Portnoy.'' ANATOMY OF A JURY, by Seymour Wishman. (Penguin, $6.95.) Seymour Wishman, in his study of the workings of the jury in our criminal-justice system, weaves ''information and statistics about the history, psychology and sociology of the jury into an often compelling narrative about a murder trial,'' Carol E. Rinzler said in these pages last year. LAST OF THE BREED, by Louis L'Amour. (Bantam, $3.95.) The hero of this contemporary adventure thriller by Louis L'Amour is an American Indian test pilot who is downed in Siberia and captured by the Russians. The author ''brings the same colorful realism to this sweeping adventure that has made his westerns so beloved,'' one reviewer said last year. RAIN OR SHINE, by Cyra McFadden. (Vintage, $4.95.) Cyra McFadden's book is a reminiscence of her parents - her father, Cy Taillon, the dean of rodeo announcers, and her mother, Pat, a vaudeville dancer and trick rider. It amounts to a ''spare-parts monument to life in the West,'' Thomas McGuane said here in 1986. ONE TO COUNT CADENCE, by James Crumley. (Vintage, $5.95.) Set in the Philippines and Vietnam in 1962, James Crumley's novel has as its hero Slag Krummel, the new sergeant of a rough company of enlistees. The author ''has a faultless ear for filthy speech,'' David Dempsey said here in 1969. He found the book ''a compelling study of the gratuitous violence in men - and how it is unleashed by the frustrations of military life. It is a story of bars, brawls and brothels - and I don't know of any writer who has done it better.'' ISAK DINESEN: The Life of a Storyteller, by Judith Thurman. (St. Martin's, $9.95.) This life of Karen Blixen, the writer Isak Dinesen, is ''a fine achievement,'' Margaret Drabble said in these pages in 1982. ''Well researched, sympathetic, fair and imaginative, it tells the story of an enigmatic and at times infuriating woman. . . . Witch, sybil, lion hunter, coffee planter, aristocrat and despot . . . she steps forth from these pages with all the force of legend.'' HEART'S DESIRE, by Gwyneth Cravens. (Fawcett Crest, $4.50.) A death in the family has far-reaching effects on three generations of women in Gwyneth Cravens's novel. In The Book Review in 1986, Mark Dintenfass called it ''sad, funny, intelligent - why not just say glorious.'' THE MASTER TERRORIST: The True Story of Abu-Nidal, by Yossi Melman. (Avon, $3.95.) Born Sabri al-Banna in Jaffa in 1937, the man now known as Abu Nidal is widely considered the most dangerous international terrorist operating today. The Times correspondent John Kifner, writing in The Book Review last year, said Yossi Melman's biography ''makes a wealth of information on Sabri al-Banna available to the general reader for the first time, including his labyrinthine relationships with the Arab world.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Landlords Manipulate Market: Thoudsands of Apertments Deliberately Kept Vacant,"SALES of new homes plummeted 14.9 percent in May, the biggest decline in five years, according to the latest Commerce Department reports. The reason for the decline, the department noted, was that first-time home buyers had been driven out of the market by rising mortgage rates. But those same economic forces, which for May pushed down the National Association of Realtor's affordability index - a measure of the feasibility of home buying for middle-class people - can also drive some of the poor into substandard or doubled-up housing, and prevent some of them from finding any housing at all. Nationally, low-income units have been disappearing at the rate of half a million a year, while salaries and public assistance levels have not kept pace with housing costs. The pressure is particularly acute in gentrified urban areas and in growing retirement or resort communities. Last week, concern that low-income families might be displaced from their homes led a Federal district judge in San Francisco to block the Reagan Administration's planned sale of 257 Federal mortgages on low-income housing around the country. Federal regulations on rents and types of tenant might no longer apply after such mortgages were paid off. When the Administration proposal was announced in April, Howard Cohen, a Boston lawyer who represents developers, noted that investors in his area would have a strong incentive. Apartments that go for $300 a month would command $800 on the open market, he said, adding: ''The people living in these units could not afford to pay open-market rents.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Embassy Home Entertainment. 99 minutes. $24.95 ''Falling in Love'' is an obscure film that has returned like a ghost from its well-deserved grave. Harry (Elliott Gould) and Sue (Susannah York) are middle-aged, married, feuding Californians, on a trip back to the Bronx, where they met, loved and married as teen-agers during World War II. It's bad enough that Harry has hopelessly romanticized that era. What's worse is that the film is built on flashbacks that force us to sit through his saccharine, cliche-ridden memories: the gang of great guys he hung out with, his yelling Jewish Mama, his wealthy limo-riding in-laws. Mr. Gould does a lot of hokey voiceovers; Ms. York spends her time glaring at him and clenching her teeth; Michel Legrand's piano music tinkles pointlessly in the background. Michelle Pfeiffer, as the teen-aged Sue, looks as ethereal and detached as she does in ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' only younger.

If we want to know what Lowell thought of William Carlos Williams, we find him taking three bites at the cherry - in 1947, 1948, 1962; and whereas we are enlightened about how he changed his mind (the two bites at John Berryman, eight years apart, are very illuminating in this way), we are confused about how far his second thoughts canceled out his first.

Nevertheless, a 27-year-old Cornell University graduate is now in line to become the first person to die in Connecticut's electric chair since Joseph (Mad Dog) Taborsky was electrocuted in 1960 for killing seven people in a robbery. Michael B. Ross, a sometime insurance salesman already serving a 120-year sentence for the murders of two young women, was sentenced to death in Superior Court in Bridgeport last week for killing four others. All four were kidnapped and two were raped. Prosecutors had contended that the law passed by the Connecticut Legislature in 1980, after the United States Supreme Court had upheld the legality of the death penalty under certain conditions, contained overly generous allowances for mitigating factors; the state's Chief Public Defender, Joseph M. Shortall, said the Ross case ''should put to rest once and for all the claims of the last three years that we have a death-penalty statute that makes it impossible to get the death penalty.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,WRITING A WINNING SITCIM: CAN THE CRAFT BE TAUGHT,"SOMETIMES IT SEEMS THAT almost everyone in Los Angeles has an idea for a situation comedy. Waiters, secretaries, taxi drivers, masseurs and college professors happily confide in strangers about the script that they're writing during their off-hours. When the American Film Institute announced last summer that it would be holding a three-week workshop for comedy writers hopeful of breaking into television, the institute received scripts from 355 applicants for the 10 openings in the workshop. Even the bag lady who frequented the Hollywood neighborhood where the institute is situated came in with a script and her $25 application fee - in nickels, dimes and quarters. (The A.F.I. refused to take her money but did read her script; it was rejected.) Now, in the kind of wish fulfillment that keeps other novices' hopes alive, four of the writers who participated in that workshop have had their scripts filmed for a one-hour program, ''The American Film Institute Comedy Special,'' to be broadcast Wednesday night at 10 on NBC; the network funded the workshop. Dick Van Dyke acts as host, and John Larroquette, Jason Bateman, Susan Ruttan, Joel Brooks, Kaye Ballard and Glynn Turman are among the actors who worked for scale to appear in the sketches by the four writers.",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Tent City: Scratching to Find Shelter for Nation's Homeless Families,"SALES of new homes plummeted 14.9 percent in May, the biggest decline in five years, according to the latest Commerce Department reports. The reason for the decline, the department noted, was that first-time home buyers had been driven out of the market by rising mortgage rates. But those same economic forces, which for May pushed down the National Association of Realtor's affordability index - a measure of the feasibility of home buying for middle-class people - can also drive some of the poor into substandard or doubled-up housing, and prevent some of them from finding any housing at all. Nationally, low-income units have been disappearing at the rate of half a million a year, while salaries and public assistance levels have not kept pace with housing costs. The pressure is particularly acute in gentrified urban areas and in growing retirement or resort communities. Last week, concern that low-income families might be displaced from their homes led a Federal district judge in San Francisco to block the Reagan Administration's planned sale of 257 Federal mortgages on low-income housing around the country. Federal regulations on rents and types of tenant might no longer apply after such mortgages were paid off. When the Administration proposal was announced in April, Howard Cohen, a Boston lawyer who represents developers, noted that investors in his area would have a strong incentive. Apartments that go for $300 a month would command $800 on the open market, he said, adding: ''The people living in these units could not afford to pay open-market rents.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Frances Spatz Leighton, a journalist and the co-author of ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House'' and other books, is so sympathetic to Nancy Davis Reagan that she almost becomes one with her. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, ''poor Nancy'' hoped the press would be kind. ''Dreamer, she,'' the author writes, describing the furor that resulted when Nancy called homosexuality ''a sickness.'' ''Couldn't she please anyone? It was enough to make a girl cry. But then she remembered the saying that always made her stiffen her spine and fight on: 'A woman is like a tea bag. You never know her strength until she is in hot water.' '' The only place Nancy could escape the press was at the California ranch, where she and Ronnie strolled hand in hand, pointing out special places. ''Here lay Ronnie's dog, Fuzzy, who had been put out of his pain when the arthritis in his hips had become unbearable. Ronnie had been very sad about what had to be done. He had given Fuzzy all the treats he wanted one day, just at the end. Had Fuzzy understood?'' Fortunately for our heroine, and our author, there is life after the White House. ''Nancy will no doubt go back to lunching with The Group at Chasen's in Beverly Hills. She will keep the top designers busy. She will be able to buy whatever she wants, at whatever the price. . . . And weekends, she will still putter around the ranch with Ronnie.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,My Blue Heaven: What If Tenants In the Projects Owned the Place?,"SALES of new homes plummeted 14.9 percent in May, the biggest decline in five years, according to the latest Commerce Department reports. The reason for the decline, the department noted, was that first-time home buyers had been driven out of the market by rising mortgage rates. But those same economic forces, which for May pushed down the National Association of Realtor's affordability index - a measure of the feasibility of home buying for middle-class people - can also drive some of the poor into substandard or doubled-up housing, and prevent some of them from finding any housing at all. Nationally, low-income units have been disappearing at the rate of half a million a year, while salaries and public assistance levels have not kept pace with housing costs. The pressure is particularly acute in gentrified urban areas and in growing retirement or resort communities. Last week, concern that low-income families might be displaced from their homes led a Federal district judge in San Francisco to block the Reagan Administration's planned sale of 257 Federal mortgages on low-income housing around the country. Federal regulations on rents and types of tenant might no longer apply after such mortgages were paid off. When the Administration proposal was announced in April, Howard Cohen, a Boston lawyer who represents developers, noted that investors in his area would have a strong incentive. Apartments that go for $300 a month would command $800 on the open market, he said, adding: ''The people living in these units could not afford to pay open-market rents.''",1987-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Wilander, ranked second in the world, recovered from a 4-2 deficit in the first set to win, 7-6, 6-1, for his second victory in the tournament in three years. It was the fourth singles title of the year for Wilander, seeded No. 1 here. Carlsson was seeded third. Carlsson's most hopeful moment of the match, played at the Longwood Cricket Club, came when he broke Wilander's serve to take a 4-2 lead in the first set. But after losing the tiebreaker, 7-5, Carlsson managed only 13 points in the second set as Wilander began rushing the net.(AP) Goldie Gets First Pro Victory: Dan Goldie, the 1986 collegiate singles champion, won his first professional title when he beat Sammy Giammalva, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of the Volvo Tennis Hall of Fame Championships in Newport, R.I.

Piquet finished more than a lap ahead of Ayrton Senna of Brazil, whose lead in the drivers' championship was cut to one point. Alain Prost of France, current champion, retired and failed to pick up points. Senna, in a Lotus Honda, now has 31 points with nine races to go.

A defender of Congressional prerogatives. A tough questioner, most specifically of Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. Representative William S. Broomfield R-Mich. Though a supporter of the President, he has felt that Congress was ignored in the Iran-contra affair, yet has said he is pleased by what he sees as the President's interest in uncovering the facts.

As chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he quickly opened hearings after the initial diversion of funds to the contras was uncovered. Has voted in support of aid for the contras. Representative Thomas S. Foley D-Wash. A forceful critic of the Administration's policy in Central America, he found many of Colonel North's answers ''somewhat evasive,'' and his descriptions of his actions as deception of the Government. Senator Orrin G. Hatch R-Utah One of the Administration's most outspoken supporters. Has tried to depict each witness's testimony in the most favorable light. Senator Howell Heflin D-Ala. With a down-home manner, he has summarized the initiative as a tale of ''rogue elephants, Persian rug merchants, loose cannons, soldiers of fortune, privateers, believers, hostages and contras.'' Representative Henry J. Hyde R-Ill. Has preached against Congressional interference in foreign policy, using the Boland amendment as a favorite example. Senator George J. Mitchell D-Me. Has raised constitutional questions of accountability with witnesses who were members of Colonel North's private network and who say they were only following orders. Representative Peter W. Rodino D-N.J. Was a member of the Watergate committee 15 years ago. Has asked tough, challenging questions, often focusing on operational details and who authorized them. Senator Warren B. Rudman R-N.H. As ranking Republican on the Senate committee, he has been a forceful critic of the Iran arms sales and the diversion of funds to the contras. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes D-Md. Raised tough questions about the Administration's policy and has been very supportive of the questioning techniques used by the select committees counsels. Senator Paul S. Trible, Jr. R-Va.

Col. Oliver L. North's secret activities, contadicting parts of Colonel North's account. Page A1 The committee chairmen rebuked Colonel North for having taken part in what they said was a policy based upon lies. After six days of testimony, Colonel North was dismissed. A1 Colonel North told some officials last August that he was giving money to contra leaders and running an air resupply operation that used C-123 aircraft, according to handwritten notes he took at the time. A12 The issue of aid to the contras, which has simmered beneath the surface throughout the Iran-contra hearings, broke into full public view in a dispute over a slide show that was to be given by Colonel North. A12 A Pakistani citizen was arrested in Philadelphia for trying to export material to Pakistan that could be used to make nuclear weapons. Officials said the arrest has major implications for United States policy toward Pakistan. A1 Two car bombs in Pakistan killed at least 72 people and wounded more than 250 in the worst bombings in years in that country. The bombs exploded amid crowds of shoppers in the heart of Karachi, the country's biggest city. A1 Toshiba was accused of betraying Japan by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone for selling militarily sensitive technology to the Soviet Union. It was his strongest comment to date on the incident. A1 Israel's first taste of glasnost was, by all indications, a hit. After a Soviet delegation slipped into the country Sunday, many Israelis say they are excited at the prospect of ending their isolation from the Soviet Union. A1 Taiwan ended martial law and called the move ''a new milestone'' for democracy on the island. The Defense Ministry also announced the release of 23 prisoners.

In addition Carter received $150 a month for almost a year after signing the contract, which was postdated to Jan. 2, 1988. Bay said Carter looked upon the payments as a loan against future earnings but that it was still an infraction of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which carries a penalty of immediate ineligibility.

Those charges are utterly false. The United States has not made concessions to those who hold our people captive in Lebanon. And we will not. The United States has not swapped boatloads or planeloads of American weapons for the return of American hostages. And we will not.'' Nov. 25 ''I was not fully informed on the nature of one of the activities undertaken in connection with this initiative.'' Jan. 27, 1987 ''Though we have made much progress, I have one major regret. I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I assume full responsibility . . . . We did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.'' Feb. 20 ''Try as I might, I cannot recall anything whatsoever about whether I approved an Israeli sale in advance or whether I approved replenishment of Israeli stocks around August of 1985. My answer, therefore, and the simple truth is, I don't remember -period.'' March 4 ''A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages . . . . As I told the Tower board, I didn't know about any diversion of funds to the contras. But as President, I cannot escape responsibility.'' March 19 When asked about whether he could have forgotten about being told of the diversion of funds from the Iran arms sales to the contras: ''Oh, no. You would have heard me without opening the door to the office if I had been told that at any time.'' May 3 ''With regard to whether private individuals were giving money to support the contras, yes, I was aware that there were people doing that. But there was nothing in the nature of a soliciatation by my Administration, to my knowledge, of anyone to do that.'' May 13 ''There was no solicitation that I know of or anything of the kind. I did know, and had been informed, that he [ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia ] was helping, but I never brought it up.'' May 15 ''And here there's no question about my being informed. I've known what's going on there. As a matter of fact, for quite a long time now, a matter of years, I have been publicly speaking of the necessity of the American people to support our program of aid to those freedom fighters down there in order to prevent there being established a Soviet beachhead here in the Western Hemisphere, in addition to the one we already have in Cuba. And to suggest that I am just finding out or that things are being exposed that I didn't know about - no. Yes, I was kept briefed on that. As a matter of fact, I was very definetly involved in the decisions about support to the freedom fighters. It was my idea to begin with.'' May 27 ''I'm being portrayed as having, behind the scenes, violated the law and done all sorts of shady things to try and violate the Congress's restrictions on aid to the freedom fighters. And it just isn't true.'' July 8 ''I've got nothing to say until the hearings are over.'' July 15 When asked whether he was suprised by Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter's denials that the President was aware of the diversion of funds to the contras in Nicaragua: ''What's new about that? I've been saying it for seven months.''",1987-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,"''The Swinging Years of Benny Goodman,'' Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272). Benny Goodman's influence on jazz clarinetists is evident from the number of them who, over the past 50 years, have drawn intentionally or unintentionally on Goodman's style and sound. Last fall, at a concert of Goodman's music by the American Jazz Orchestra, Walt Levinsky showed unusual perception and skill, both as an interpreter of Goodman's clarinet roles and as a conductor of arrangements by Fletcher Henderson, Eddie Sauter, Jimmy Mundy and Mel Powell - arrangements that highlighted the Goodman band repertory. Mr. Levinsky, a veteran of the Goodman band in its later years, is leading a 14-piece orchestra this weekend and for the next two weeks, a band that is reviving the sound and spirit of the Goodman era with such top-flight musicians as Warren Vache on trumpet, Urbie Green on trombone, Frank Wess on saxophones, Marty Napoleon on piano and Butch Miles on drums, as well as a one-time Goodman vocalist, Lynn Roberts. They play two performances tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11. There is a $15 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.",1987-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Love in its many forms dominates tonight's program as the Dance Theater of Harlem presents excerpts from ''Othello,' Katherine Healy and Leonid Kozlov perform a duet from ''Cinderella'' and Ron Brown's Evidence Dance Company does a work called ''Heat's On.'' Tomorrow, Laura Dean's Dancers and Musicians will be joined by Johanna Boyce and her Brooklyn-based troupe, the Calf Women. The Sunday program includes the Green Grass Cloggers from Southern Appalachia, Irish music and dance by Donny and Eileen Golden and jazz-accompanied tap dancing by Manhattan Tap.

CENTRAL PARK INSPIRATION Many an artist has been inspired by the vistas of Central Park, including Holly Fairbank, a Manhattan choreographer. Her inspiration came from the small pond at the park's wooded northwest corner, and the resultant work, ''Pooldance,'' will be performed tonight and tomorrow at 6:30 at water's edge. Four members of Ms. Fairbank's company - a movement chorus composed of six members of Veritas, a local drug-rehabilitation center - and several musicians will present the abstract 30-minute piece, which was commissioned by the Manhattan Arts Council. The free performances will nearly encircle the pool, which is near Central Park West and 100th Street. Rain date for both performances is Sunday at 6:30 P.M. Information: 222-5623.

The bluestone church, built in 1859, has been transformed into an intimate, 150-seat concert hall that will be the site for periodic chamber music and other performances loosely grouped under the rubric Bluestone Concerts. Saturday's program by the ensemble includes works by Dvorak and Prokofiev. The hall is at Orchard and Corning Streets in Rhinecliff, a hamlet two miles west of Rhinebeck; tickets are $7.

The National Chorale, directed by Martin Josman, is one such group, and its 24 members will sing at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center at 8 P.M. Saturday in a program called ''Operetta Tonight.'' Highlights of the free concert include songs from ''Her Regiment'' and ''Sweethearts'' by Victor Herbert; Sigmund Romberg's ''New Moon,'' ''Desert Song'' and his little-known 1931 collaboration with Oscar Hammerstein 2d, ''Children of Dreams,'' and Rudolph Friml's ''Vagabond King.''

The concert is part of the chorale's summer series of 27 outdoor performances throughout the metropolitan area. Information: 333-5333.

DOWNTOWN WALKING TOUR Despite the recent tides of gentrification, the Lower East Side remains a living monument to Eastern European and Jewish immigration. This rich history can be discovered on a four-and-a-half-hour walking tour of the area beginning at 10:30 A.M. Sunday at Straus Square, at Canal and Essex Streets. The tour will include a talk about immigration history at the Eldridge Street Synagogue by Gerard Wolfe, the author of ''The Synagogues of New York's Lower East Side'' and a historian of New York City.

Compared with Peter Sellars' forced, grim and deliberately alienating staging of ''Don Giovanni'' - and the festival's Don Juan theme and close juxtaposition of these two productions begs for such a comparison - this sometimes nutty, sometimes risible but frequently sexy, brilliant and illuminating feminist revision of the opera is an altogether more gripping experience.

But the Republican vice chairman of the committee said he believed the admiral. Page 1 Many people think the President lied when he said he did not know that money from the Iran arms sales went to the contras, despite Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter's testimony supporting his account, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. 1 Poindexter shows little regret 6 France cut off relations with Iran, and the two Governments banned each other's diplomats from leaving their countries.

One more argument for Fox is that he was already elected. Seventy-five percent of the writers' votes are required for election, and in 1985 Fox received 74.7 percent of the votes. The Hall, however, decided that a ''pure'' 75 percent was needed. The rule can be found nowhere in the election rules and is totally unfair.

A top handler of pitchers, Munson excelled in calling a ball game. In the eight years since his death, the American League has not seen a catcher of comparable talents.

us,Headliners; Out of Reach,"The Italian Government is not a great enough authority to command obedience from the Vatican, according to a ruling last week by Italy's highest court. The court ruled for the Vatican in a case in which Italian prosecutors sought to extradite Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, the head of the Vatican bank, on charges of fraud related to the 1982 failure of Banco Ambrosiano. Ambrosiano went under when it was unable to collect $1.3 billion in loans to 10 shadowy companies controlled by the Vatican bank. Church officials agreed to pay $250 million to Ambrosiano's creditors, but denied any wrongdoing. In February, authorities issued warrants for the arrests of Archbishop Marcinkus and two other church officials who remained out of reach at the Vatican, straining relationships between the Italian Government and the Catholic city-state. The court ruled last week that the warrants were invalid because Vatican officials are not answerable to Italy.

us,WHO'S NOT IN THE HALL OF FAME WHO SHOULD BE,"In this era of superstars (with super statistics and super salaries to match), we tend to lose sight of the fact that the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown was originally intended to honor not only players of exceptional ability, but those of exemplary virtue and integrity as well. It is with this fact in mind that I state my case for the inclusion of Gil Hodges in the Hall of Fame. Hodges's statistics, while not of Ruthian magnitude, are nonetheless impressive, including 14 grand slams (long the National League record), 17 total bases in one game (also long the National League record) and the awesome, rarely achieved four home runs in a single game. Yet the real reasons for his enshrinement have little to do with his accomplishments with bat or glove. Instead, as any Hodges fan will tell you, Hodges belongs in the Hall because he was a gentle giant of a man, a quiet ex-Marine who owned the distinction of being such a fair-minded player that he was never ejected from a game.

us,DISCREET MANEUVERS,"THESE EXAMPLES MAY BE TOP-FLIGHT and top-priced, but they contain all the makings of the genre: a particular style of attire called discretion - better yet, deception - dressing. It has probably always existed, whatever the current fashion mode. But now, when clothes play such an overt role in pronouncing a woman's place in life or personal point of view, this deliberately discreet way of turning oneself out is even more intriguing. The idea is this: a woman gets herself up to look as if she will fade into the wallpaper or blend in with the rest of her secure crowd. She appears to demurely hide her natural assets or perhaps even imply genteel dowdiness. The effect, of course, is just the reverse. Men flock to the side of the supposed wallflower. Perhaps they are sure they will uncover the soul of a siren. Aileen Mehle, the society columnist known as Suzy, once wrote an essay in which she warned readers to watch out for the ''little brown wrens.'' The identities of the protagonists in that particular piece are not important, but their successors are having a field day cloaking their true high spirits in subtle, very subtle, camouflage. There are, for instance, devotees of the ''Miss Brody'' school of tweeds, classy casual clothes that evoke the spirit of the cinema's famous Scottish schoolteacher. Then there are intimations of proper schoolgirl garb, now made of sinuous silk instead of staunch gabardine. There are the indisputably correct ''insignia'' clothes that spell richness but in discreet letters. And a myriad of choices of evening dresses that cover from throat to ankle yet are heart-throbbingly pretty. Now, of course, there are many demure women who choose to dress in this way to display their true colors. But then again, can we ever be sure?",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Sugar',"The British writer Antonia Byatt chooses the leisurely, meditative mode of Henry James, E. M. Forster and George Eliot, whom she clearly reveres and whose presences are strongly felt in ''Sugar: And Other Stories,'' her seventh book. (''The Virgin in the Garden'' and ''Still Life'' are probably the Byatt novels most familiar to American readers.) Even to venture into that unfashionable territory -where a moral universe is presupposed and every act is laden with more, not less, meaning than it can readily bear - denotes a certain originality. Unlike the great realists, though, Ms. Byatt's gift is not so much in unraveling the complexities of the ordinary as in sensing its uncanny and nightmarish aspects. Her seemingly bland characters live in psychic infernos; the most dreaded fantasies come true; ghosts and witches turn up where a conventional author would present neurosis. The tone of the collection suggests a powerful late-Victorian intellect trained on 20th-century social and personal dilemmas. That peculiar stance gives some stories a fine timelessness and freedom; in a few cases it makes for too-tight control.",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,LONG ISLAND GUIDE,"'MARIN IN OIL' Although he made his reputation as a watercolorist, John Marin, one of the pioneers in American modern art, was also an accomplished painter in oils. In fact, from the early 1930's through his death in 1953 he devoted increasing attention to exploring that medium. And the results of his interest, said Klaus Kertess, the curator of the Parrish Art Museum, were precursors of the revolutionary American painting of the 1950's. Now, for the first time, a museum, the Parrish in Southampton, is focusing on those works, and with 50 paintings, done between 1913 and 1953 and assembled from leading museums and collectors, has created ''Marin in Oil.'' The show opens today and can be seen, through Sept. 20, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays, except Wednesdays, and 1 to 5 P.M. Sundays at the Parrish, on Job's Lane. ON THEIR TOES With something new, something old and something borrowed from Balanchine's repertory, the Eglevsky Ballet begins its summer park tour today at the Chapin Lakeside Theater in Eisenhower Park. The program, backed in East Meadow by the Merrick Symphony, includes Balanchine's ''Tarantella''; Act II of ''Giselle''; ''Twelfth Night,'' created by the company's artistic director, Michael Vernon, and the world premiere of ''Kick,'' a ballet set to Cole Porter music by Mr. Vernon. The performance is at 8 P.M. and will be repeated Thursday at 8:30 P.M. at Heckscher Park in Huntington; Friday at 8:15 P.M. at Morgan Park in Glen Cove, and next Sunday at 8:15 P.M. at Kennedy High School in Plainview.

It is my contention that no player, excluding pitchers, should merit selection to the Hall of Fame unless he is outstanding in at least three of those five categories. Richie Ashburn is such a player. He played for 15 seasons for the Phillies, the Cubs and the Mets (1948-62). He hit .308 career, had 2,574 hits, scored 1,322 runs, walked 1,198 times, stole 234 bases, and struck out only 571 times in 8,365 times at bat. He also won two batting titles. It was Ashburn's misfortune to have been an exceptional center fielder in the same era in which Mantle, Mays and Snider played that position, as well as to have been a daring baserunner at the same time that the peerless Jackie Robinson roamed the bases.

But John Weisman's third novel uses them as a backdrop for the story of an assimilated American Jew's spiritual journey in Israel - from naivete to disillusionment, from faith to commitment. Jared Paul Gordon, a ''well-paid Jeremiah for a weekly news magazine,'' insists on writing the truth about Israel, no holds barred. But he feels guilty when his lover, a zealous Zionist, calls him a ''self-hating Jew'' who's playing into the hands of Israel's enemies. As the Promised Land draws Jared back to the faith of his forefathers, he begins to identify with Israel. But he sees a nation that has strayed from the ideals of its founders. The plot centers on Jared's discovery of a campaign by Jewish terrorists against Arabs in the occupied West Bank. Jared's vision may be painful to the Americans who view Israel solely as a righteous David besieged by an evil Arab Goliath. But Israel has had to make compromises to survive in a hostile world. And Jared wonders whether it has gone too far, ''moving slowly but inexorably toward the East.'' In the end, Jared gives up trying to reconcile his roles as Jew and journalist, and throws himself into ''a battle for the soul'' of Israel. Mr. Weisman has a tendency to overwrite and his plot stumbles here and there, but ''Blood Cries'' is an engaging, provocative and troubling book.",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Actually, the photograph was taken about four years ago at the Homestead, Fla., Air Force base at the request of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to illustrate an advertisement for a Westinghouse radar product. The photograph was supplied to The Times by the New York office of SIPA Press, an international picture agency with headquarters in Paris, which has acknowledged it erred. The photograph was included with other photographs showing United States Customs officers and Florida police officers taking action against drug smugglers. The photographs were accompanied by captions dated January 1986. The caption for the photograph purportedly showing the arrest of the smugglers did not indicate in any way that the picture had been posed. Rodger Garland, chief of the United States Customs air branch at the Homestead base, said that one of the people depicted as being under arrest in the photograph was a contract employee working for the Customs service and that the other was a Westinghouse employee.",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Disasters, misfortunes and crises punctuate this book like exclamation points. Chapter one ends with a car crash that kills Vartan Garba the day before his wedding; his fiancee, Anna Karavajian, is propelled to map out a plan for her life, for marriage was ''the only fate she had ever imagined.'' For several years she teaches math to Bronx eighth graders; then she joins Karavajian Press, her father's business in New York City. By age 37, Anna has become president and chief executive officer. Catastrophes such as stolen inventory and lost accounts plague the business, but Anna, a peppery and resourceful woman, remains in control. On business at an antiquated theater in Flushing, she meets Charles Borden, a divorced playwright. At once, Ms. Dworkin stages a scene that pitches Anna and Charles into pandemonium: a bizarre robbery resulting in more stolen goods. They survive the ordeal and become lovers. Their affair - predictably - is characterized by histrionics, as well as by genuine tenderness. Anna brazens her way through the suspicions, separations and indignant accusations that mark their relationship. Gradually, Anna and the rough-edged Charles allow themselves to be loved again. Throughout Anna's turbulent work and love life, her two sisters provide the ballast of sisterly attention and affection that keeps her on an even keel. Their scenes are full of flip, funny talk and plenty of singing, cavorting, arguing and consoling. Ms. Dworkin creates some fine moments when Anna's Armenian family gathers and supports its own. ''Stolen Goods'' provides light entertainment as it barrels along through the adventures of its frisky heroine.

Darrell Patterson, a doctor in his 30's, is the kind of guy who dislikes his 7-year-old son for crying and not being very good at sports, and who is proud when his wife cheats at tennis. Is this first novel a joke? A parody of yuppie selfishness? Initially, the unmitigated flatness of the first-person narrative seems as if it might be due to Darrell's prescription drug problem; he controls his moods by taking assorted uppers and downers, thereby losing any personality of his own and endangering his marriage. As an emergency room doctor, Darrell offers stereotyped descriptions of everyone he encounters, even though none of these people have any bearing on the story. Among his patients, there's Carol, who ''looks tough, very butch, like the prototypical lesbian that she is,'' a gay man who ''has a little mustache and is slender,'' and several hysterical and/or stupid female patients with ''female complaints'' (and it's clear Darrell doesn't like doing pelvics). Todd Grimson incorporates his own experiences working as an interviewer in an emergency room. The descriptions seem endless, and one or two scenes in the emergency room would have been more than enough to show the tedium and occasional ghastliness of the job. But all this ugliness, personal and societal, would have been fine if anything had happened in the novel - if Darrell had expressed an honest emotion to his wife, for instance, or confronted his drug problem. His marriage improves slightly, but by the end, Darrell is still a jerk who takes pills and is convinced that he's smarter than everyone around him. ''This is my life,'' thinks Darrell, in what's meant to be a great revelation toward the end of the book, ''imperfect as it is.'' But why do we have to read about it?",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 The contras killed nine soldiers, three children and a pregnant woman, but failed to capture their target Thursday in their first major attack since the Iran-contra hearings focused American public attention on their movement. 1 France suggested to Iran that both countries agree to evacuate their respective diplomats and embassy personnel within five days. The move was a bid to calm the crisis caused by France's decision to break diplomatic relations with Teheran. 1 The U.S. plan to escort tankers to and from Kuwait that are flying the American flag is tailored to the relatively crowded waters of the Persian Gulf, officials say. 12 An anti-apartheid labor group in South Africa formally adopted the political program of black guerrillas fighting to end white rule. The group also committed itself to putting pressure on Pretoria to sign the Geneva Convention. 5 Vietnam agreed to U.S. conditions for a meeting with a special envoy to discuss the issue of missing servicemen, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. But he warned that there might not be much progress. 3 Some Thai children from the U.S. have been sent to Thailand by their families under an program designed to strengthen their cultural roots. For eight weeks, the children experience what it means to be ''khon Thai,'' or a ''Thai person.'' 12 In Cambodia, the soft approach has been adopted by the Vietnamese-sponsored Government of Heng Samrin and his Prime Minister, Hun Sen, on sensitive issues in agriculture and religion, in an effort to make Communism palatable. 8 Army impatience hinted in Seoul 3 South Koreans in U.S. go home 6 Ethnic tension in Old Delhi 9 Britain reviews war-crime case 13 Casey left legacy of doubt 14 National 16-23, 30-32 A revision of the welfare program emphasizing parental responsibility rather than Government handouts was proposed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

The programs include alternative sentences, detention at home and supervised detention in a halfway house. 1 Democratic Presidential candidates lectured state party chairmen from all parts of the country on how to win in 1988. For many of the officials, the speeches represented a chance to assess many of the hopefuls. 22 Patricia Schroeder was supported in her undecided quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination at the convention of the National Organization for Women. She received enough money to qualify for Federal matching campaign funds, officials said. 22 Six more bodies were found in Texas by searchers scouring a river downstream from where floodwaters swept away a bus and a van filled with teen-agers leaving a church camp Friday.

Statistics, of course, are subject to many interpretations, but Bartell's should be carefully considered. They are in many instances better than those of half the shortstops in the Hall, both for hitting and for fielding effectiveness and range. Most particularly, his 442 doubles are more than those of any Hall of Fame shortstop except Wagner and Cronin, as well as more than those of such sluggers as Sisler, Cepeda, Slaughter and Stargell.

Of all the things we remember so fondly, from the starchy collar on Snow White's gown to the way the dwarfs' bulbous little noses poke over the foot of her bed, the heroine's personality is hardly this classic's greatest selling point. Snow White, after all, is first seen cheerfully scrubbing the stairs of her stepmother's castle, surrounded by a squad of tweeting white birdies. She then goes on to clean up the seven dwarfs' cottage, cook their dinner and badger them into washing their faces and hands. Aside from her great daintiness and her credentials as a fervent housekeeper, Snow White has no distinct personality. She exists only to be victimized by her wicked stepmother - a far more interesting character - and to wait for Mr. Right.",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,THE SUN NEVER SETS ON THE ENGLISH NOVEL,"''HE would have preferred not to speak to his own kinsmen in English which was after all a foreign language.'' So writes the Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe of the title character of his 1966 novel, ''A Man of the People.'' But he does speak in English, and not only because ''speeches made in the vernacular were liable to be distorted . . . in the press,'' but also because some members of his audience ''did not speak our own tongue and he did not wish to exclude them. They were all citizens of our great country.'' For in Nigeria, a country the British created out of what Mr. Achebe describes as ''hundreds of autonomous communities'' - and almost that many indigenous languages - English has by default become the ''national language.'' It stands as the only way in which Nigeria's ''many peoples [ can ] talk to one another . . . the one central language enjoying nationwide currency.'' And out of that currency, the English language itself began in the 1950's to be enriched by Mr. Achebe's own novels, the plays of the 1986 Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, the compelling fictions fashioned out of Yoruba legend by Amos Tutuola.",1987-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Stephen Roche of Ireland, in second place over all, reduced Delgado's lead from 39 to 21 seconds, which put him in a position to pass Delgado in the 24th stage tomorrow, a time trial encircling Dijon.

With two stages remaining, Longo is expected to win the tour in her third attempt. (AP) Baseball The Streak Goes On: The Salt Lake City Trappers ran their winning streak to 26 games, the longest in organized baseball in 41 years, by beating the Idaho Falls Braves, 14-4, last night in a Pioneer League game. The professional record is 27 straight victories, set by Corsicana of the Texas League in 1902 and matched by the old Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1921. The Trappers will go for their 27th straight tonight against the Pocatello Giants.(AP) Boxing Snipes Wins by Knockout: Renaldo (Mister) Snipes won the Continental Americas heavyweight title last night when he knocked out Terry Anderson at 2:40 of the 10th round of a scheduled 12-round bout in Felt Forum. Snipes showed little proficiency in a fight that was frequently booed for lack of action by a crowd of 1,746. The fighters spent most of the first nine rounds standing at close range and throwing occasional punches that rarely made impact. Late in the 10th round, Snipes caught Anderson with a right uppercut to the chin. Anderson dropped to one knee and took the mandatory eight count. Snipes, who is from Yonkers, did not take much longer to finish off Anderson, who is from Tampa, Fla. He nailed Anderson with a left hook and, as Anderson began to fall, landed a grazing right. This time, Anderson fell backward onto the canvas. The referee, Arthur Mercante Jr., counted to six and then waved an end to the bout. Snipes's record is 29-6-1 with 14 knockouts. Anderson's is 15-2 with 14 knockouts.

Mandel in the catalogue to a recent traveling show on the subject, the movement was instrumental in restoring some of the esthetic confidence lost in the welter of commercialism following the Civil War.

Here are several of the most significant changes, which followed President Reagan's first proposal of the so-called zero option in 1981. Jan. 15, 1986: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, offers a plan calling for, among other things, the elimination of American and Soviet intermediate-range missiles in Europe, as the first step that the British and French arsenals be reduced, along with American weapons, under a new treaty. Feb. 6: Mr. Gorbachev, meeting with Senator Edward M. Kennedy in Moscow, drops his precondition for an agreement on intermediate-range missiles that required an end to testing for ''Star Wars,'' the space defense program. Later, the Russians will link the agreement once again to ''Star Wars'' and then once again drop the condition. Oct. 11-12: At a meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, Mr. Gorbachev and President Reagan agreed that there should be a ban on American and Soviet medium-range missiles in Europe, and included a limit of 100 warheads on medium-range missiles outside Europe. There was also an agreement in principle that shorter-range missiles should be limited. April 15, 1987: Mr. Gorbachev tells Secretary of State George P. Shultz, according to the Russian version, that the Russians are ready to ''eliminate shorter range missiles in Europe within a relatively short and clearly defined time. Mr. Shultz says the Russians said they were prepared for a global elimination of such missiles. June: Col. Gen. Nikolai F. Chervov, head of the arms control directorate of the Soviet General Staff, proposes informally a compromise that would lead to a worldwide ban on American and Soviet medium-range and short-range missiles. The United States responds favorably, and the Soviet Foreign Ministry later denies the report. The compromise is the basis for a Gorbachev statement in July. July 22: Mr. Gorbachev says in an interview that he is prepared to accept a worldwide ban on medium-range and short-range missiles, dropping Moscow's previous insistence on keeping 100 medium-range warheads in Soviet Asian territory. A day later, the Kremlin's chief arms negotiator reiterates the Soviet position that any agreement would require destruction of United States warheads earmarked for use on short-range West German Pershing 1A missiles.",1987-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide; Cold Plates and Salads,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. AMERICAN FESTIVAL CAFE, #20 West 50th Street (246-6699) - *(July 27, 1984) American antiques are featured against the background of light woods, glass and brass of this glittering restaurant with its outdoor umbrella-covered tables that spill onto the winter skating rink of Rockefeller Center. The summer menu offers cold main dishes as well as appetizers for diners who want to keep cool. You might choose the salamagundi, a salad of greens, bacon, ham, smoked turkey, peppered beef and cheese; poached Atlantic salmon with tabbouleh and cucumbers, or Gulf shrimp with red-leaf lettuce, avocado and salsa. Cold plates $11.75 to $15.75. Fridays and Saturdays, 7:30 A.M. to 12:30 A.M.; Sundays, 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. LAVIN'S, 23 West 39th Street (921-1288) - *(June 20, 1986) Carved oak-paneled walls and symmetrical rows of tables contribute to the classy cafe ambiance of this midtown restaurant. A comfortable wine bar up front offers an ever-changing selection of by-the-glass offerings. The summer menu features a number of salads and cold dishes: smoked duck and chicken-breast plate with rice salad and marinated baby vegetables; cold poached Norwegian salmon with fresh tomato and herb coulis, California caviar and snow peas, and mesquite-grilled carpaccio, the filet of beef sliced paper thin and served over garden relish salad. Cold dishes $7 to $16. Fridays, noon to 10 P.M.; closed Saturdays and Sundays. MENAGE A TROIS, #134 East 48th Street (593-8242) - *(Nov. 7, 1986) Diners are invited to ''graze'' at this contemporary French restaurant done in soothing beiges with wood trim, comfortable banquettes and well-spaced tables. Most portions fall between traditional appetizer and entree size. Cold-dish options from the eight-page menu include the chicken combination, which is smoked, marinated and julienne with three dressings; whole lobster tail with black truffle slices with truffle vinaigrette and warm wild mushroom salad, and poached quail eggs on artichoke with smoked salmon, oyster, scallop, lobster and Russian caviar. Two of the many salad choices are duck breast with fresh foie gras, French beans and shallots, and a seafood salad of salmon, lobster and scallops with dill and croutons. Cold dishes $7.25 to $23.75. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 11:45 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. POSITANO, #250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street (777-6211) - **(Jan. 25, 1985) This chic and informal restaurant with dining areas on three tiers, high ceiling, mammoth columns and green marble tables has the look of high-toned Italian design. A number of cold plates are available for the summer: antipasto choices of assorted smoked fish with a mayonnaise herb sauce and rolled mozzarella and prosciutto with roasted peppers; a chilled salad of straw and hay pasta tossed with tuna and sun-dried tomato puree and walnuts; Continental salad of chicken with carrots, celery, potatoes, avocado and smoked cheese, and a main dish of carpaccio of raw beef on arugula with cheese shavings and mushrooms. Cold dishes $10 to $17. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.; closed Sundays. SOFI, #102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street (463-8888) - **(May 22, 1987) Run by the owner of Lavin's on West 39th Street, Sofi is situated in a soaring loft space, and the dining room is long and cavernous with a rim of tables on a balcony. A number of cold dishes are offered, including eggplant caviar over ripe tomato confit and flaked roasted skate with a salad of ripe yellow and cherry tomatoes and pesto. And the gardener's salad is worth a trip - composed of arugula, chicory and other greens for nesting marinated mushrooms, lumps of eggplant caviar, thin curls of deep-fried artichoke hearts, leeks and zucchini. Cold plates $6 to $14. Fridays, noon to 2:30 and 6 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. TATANY, #388 Third Avenue, near 28th Street (686-1871) - **(Oct. 17, 1986) This trim, informal restaurant with sushi bar and two dining rooms is a good option for anyone looking for a cool meal on a hot summer night. The chefs turn out an exemplary array of sashimi, sushi and assorted maki to tempt any aficionado. The firm and fresh mixed sushi platter includes tuna, salmon, fluke, shrimp and maki. Another arresting composition of texture and flavor is salmon skin maki, which is brittle and oceanic, packed in rice with minced green onions and rolled in a lightly toasted seaweed sheet and crowned with tiny red lumpfish caviar. Main dishes $6.50 to $12.25. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5:30 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. What the stars mean, page C26.",1987-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, JULY 25, 1987","International 2-7 A Kuwaiti tanker hit a mine just west of an Iranian island in the Persian Gulf. None of the 26 people aboard the 400,000-ton Bridgeton, which is traveling under American naval escort, were wounded. Page 1 No U.S. minesweepers were around when the mine detonation sent a shock wave through the American convoy in the Persian Gulf. There are only three active duty minesweepers in the entire United States Navy. 1 China is not likely to block an effort by the United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Iran, but will continue to provide military support to the Iranians nonetheless, Western diplomats said. 5 Bonn's position on an arms accord between the United States and the Soviet Union is avoiding a commitment on the fate of 72 Pershing 1A missles and their American-held warheads. 1 In the Iran-contra investigation, Senators and representatives on the committees, Democrats and Republicans alike, praised Secretary of State George P. Shultz as an emblem of sanity and candor surrounded by folly and deceit. 1 Reactions to Mr. Shultz's testimony vary at the White House. President Reagan believes it has been ''honest, sincere and helpful.'' But some officials are squirming over his portrait of disarray in the Administration. 7 A lone hijacker was overpowered by the cabin crew of an Air Afrique jet after he killed a French passenger and critically wounded a steward while the plane was on the tarmac at Cointrin Airport in Geneva. 1 Tamil guerrilas in Sri Lanka agreed in principle to a proposal that could end a bitter ethnic conflict, officials said. The move followed negotiations between India and Sri Lanka. 3 Pretoria continued its crackdown on opponents of apartheid, effectively wiping out, with detentions, the visible leadership of the country's major anti-apartheid group, the United Democratic Front. 3 Interviews with top Israeli officials will not be granted to the NBC television network in reaction to the network's failure to respond to Israeli criticism of its recent documentary about the West Bank, the Government announced. 54 Mapping the arctic 3 Henley-on-Thames journal 4 British novelist wins libel award 4 Clash in Haiti leaves 10 dead 4 American tells of massacre 11 National 8-10, 32 Man in the News: William Sessions was selected by President Reagan as the new Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Federal District Judge from San Antonio, Judge Sessions is known for being stern but scrupulously fair. 1 Confirmation of Judge Sessions should be relatively quick, White House and Justice Department officials said. The selection of a Federal judge for the post should limit Congressional opposition, they said. 10 A sand bar in the ississippi River has paralyzed traffic, stalling hundreds of barges with millions of tons in cargo in a nautical version of gridlock on the nation's busiest inland waterway. 1 Union Carbide will pay penalties of $408,500 in settlement of charges by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that it committed hundreds of willful violations of Federal job health and safety rules. 8 The economy grew somewhat faster this spring than was generally expected, the Commerce Department said, but January-March growth was revised downward. The second-quarter data pointed to a modest, but better-balanced, economic expansion. 37 Delta Air Lines will issue refunds to anyone concerned about flying on the airline as a result of a recent series of mishaps, the company said. The refunds will even be given to holders of restricted fare tickets. 37 The Wedtech Corporation owes the Government tens of millions of dollars for contracts that the company did not fulfill, company officials disclosed. The failure was partly caused by the ''criminal acts of former management,'' they said. 8 The Interior Department suspended an official in California temporarily, pending a review. At issue is whether the official sought employment with a law firm whose client benefited from a water rights settlement he had negotiated. 8 A new weapon for political strategy helps candidates understand how Americans react to them and their ideas with a personal computer that measures an audience's response instantly and then calculates changes from second to second. 9 Tests of Vietnam veterans find average dioxin levels 8 Minnesota storms kill 2 8 Jacobs severed from libel suit 9 Worker turnover said to slow toxic waste cleanup 9 F.A.A. head says flying is safe 11 Promotion of two generals denied by Senate panel 32 Regional 33-35 A proposal on AIDS instruction for children in kindergarten through 12th grade will be circulated to school officials across the state for their reactions, the New York State Board of Regents voted. 33 Columbus Avenue rents are soaring, and fashionable restaurants are being pushed aside by high-priced clothing stores. Commercial real estate brokers see the transformation as part of the evolution of the center of West Side Manhattan glitz. 33 A fire released toxic chemicals, exposing as many as 55 firefighters and police officers to possible PCB contamination, the police said. The release was the result of an underground fire in the Bronx that ruptured an electrical transformer. 35 As temperatures climbed past 90, New Yorkers took to tall drinks, short haircuts and metaphysical means to maintain their cool. But much of the country was even more deeply immersed in a pressure cooker. 33 Verbal jousting over development in the region has become sharp. Mayor Koch, who has appeared in a series of humorous advertisements, was the butt of the joke in a commercial prepared by New Jersey's Public Service Electric & Gas Company. 33 After getting a taste of law school at the Summer Institute for Pre-Legal Studies at Rutgers Law School, some of the 13 black and Hispanic college students in the program have decided on law as a career. 34 New York City's top labor negotiator sought to have a mediator join talks between the city and municipal unions after declaring a lack of progress in negotiations.

It was a caper out of a Hollywood production of the 1930's: five dinner-jacketed thieves walk into a deluxe Manhattan hotel, handcuff 19 employees and guests and walk out with more than $10 million in jewels and cash. What is more, the thieves quarrel, the loot disappears, and the planner takes the fall (in Attica). If that were the extent of the story told by Ira Berkow, a sportswriter for The New York Times, it would be by itself a solid and fascinating account of the 1972 robbery of the Pierre Hotel. But Mr. Berkow, drawing on exhaustive research and interviews with Bobby Comfort, jewel thief extraordinary and mastermind of the Pierre and other robberies, spins a dramatic tale of the meticulous planning and audacious execution of heists and the police work that follows them and ultimately foils robbers, at least some of the time. He also gives some clues as to what pushed Comfort into the criminal life (parents, of course) and describes the despairing terror of victims, including the actress Sophia Loren. As Mr. Berkow describes him, Comfort's basic flaws were a lack of responsibility and an inability to be in touch with reality for any length of time. For all the derring-do, Comfort failed when he attempted honest business and ended his days watching Phil Donahue on television and often showing up as the only father at afternoon P.T.A. meetings.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A SIGN OF THE EIGHTIES. By Gail Parent. (Putnam, $17.95.) In this bittersweet comic novel, Gail Parent displays her knack for transforming social trends into fiction. At the age of 35, Shelly Silver runs a successful upscale catering service, uses a personal shopper at Bloomingdales and sees herself as successful in every way but one: she is still single. Taking to heart the now-infamous finding that highly educated women in their 30's have only a slim chance of marrying, she casts aside her feminist principles to stalk a husband. The man she schemes to marry is her former lover Mickey Burke, a popular but frustrated television comedy writer who yearns to make movies. But Mickey, who is ''short, dark, and funny,'' suffers from that much-publicized affliction of the 1980's - fear of intimacy. Enter Astra Rainbow Blakely, Mickey's new secretary, ''the most serious 22-year-old in the country.'' The daughter of 1960's flower children, Astra yearns for two things: perfect normality in her life and absolution for her childhood role in a little boy's accidental death. Eventually, Astra provides the means to solve everyone's problems, including her own, and Ms. Parent finds a way to put a comic twist on a whole season of potential New York magazine cover stories. Ms. Parent, who won an Emmy for her work on the ''The Carol Burnett Show,'' is at her satiric best in the first half of the novel, when she describes Mickey's latest television series and his difficulties with network executives. In the novel's second half, however, the trendy tale loses force, as the manhunting stunts of Shelly and her friend Greta grow tiresome and tasteless.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"PAINTED IN BLOOD: Understanding Europeans. By Stuart Miller. (Atheneum, $17.95.) The premise of this short and breezy book is that Europeans differ from Americans because of their ''background of collective violence'' - their history, according to Stuart Miller, is ''painted in blood.'' ''We must think,'' he suggests, ''of a vast South Bronx of a continent, repeatedly devastated not for ten or twenty years but, as men experience time, forever.'' He concedes that European cities are safer than ours; but what about German highway manners, he asks, and the nine-bolt security locks in Italy? He is horrified by the militarization of Western Europe (''The road signs I pass on the German Autobahn give two speed limits: one for cars and one for tanks''); he doesn't seem to realize that the United States may have a part in it. Mr. Miller's historical generalizations are no more misleading than those to be found in the average tourist guidebook, and ''Painted in Blood'' is partly a guide for American innocents abroad - especially businessmen. But Mr. Miller, the author of a novel, ''Hot Springs,'' and other works, has written a book that, like most American books about Europeans, is ultimately about Americans. He takes as one of his epigraphs Emerson's observation that ''all educated Americans, first or last, go to Europe.'' He makes it clear that he is no exception, and tells us about his student years in Italy, his Belgian wife and in-laws, his European colleagues. This gives ''Painted in Blood'' an appealing personal flavor - like a 19th-century travel sketch. He neglects to add that Emerson, in a more familiar and disturbing passage, remarked that ''it is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans.''",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Experimentation along these lines has been in the wind for some time now. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, Philip Glass, Frank Zappa, John McLaughlin and Robert Fripp were among those who approached this amalgam from different directions. More recently, the Downtown school has spawned its own galaxy of avant-garde rockers, among them Glenn Branca, John Zorn, Laurie Anderson, Mikel Rouse and Scott Johnson.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Well, there's nothing much stimulating about it, so their characterization is apt enough. The pleasant orchestral and piano selections (snippets and single movements for the most part) are played without great distinction, and the hi-fi sound lacks the sparkle it should have.

Mrs. Leimbach has a nice sense of humor, which works best when she stays close to her home and hearth, farm and family, dispensing neighborliness and even, in a burst of generosity, her recipe for apple pie (in the crust ''milk is the key ingredient''). She writes of church bazaars, the making of curtains and pickles, and unending concern over weather - for reasons more important than weekend plans. Those pieces that stray from her realm, or stretch for larger meaning, show the strain. The collection is best taken at face value, as eight seasons in the life of a middle-aged woman, during which she loses a child and a parent and gains a grandchild. ''Worthy News,'' her musing on the purpose of a small-town weekly, shows exactly for whom, and why, her writing works well: ''Nothing earth shattering [ in a weekly ] ,'' she writes.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"IN THE LONG RUN. By N. J. Crisp. (Viking, $16.95.) Competent thrillers may be a dime a dozen in the world of figurative speech, but in the airport bookshop they cost considerably more. That's why most of us frequent fliers look for something beyond the swift plot and pungent dollops of sex and violence that are standard in the genre. In his latest thriller, however, N. J. Crisp, author of ''The Brink,'' has failed to deliver anything more than the basics. This is particularly disappointing since his protagonist, Stephen Haden, is a potentially fascinating character. Haden is a Fluchthelfer (literally, an ''escape helper''), an expert at smuggling people across the Iron Curtain - for a price. When Haden is shot one morning in his home in Zurich, he must ask himself that always disturbing question: Who wants him dead, and why? As a member of a morally and politically ambiguous profession, he could have been shot by either side, or even by someone within his own organization. But instead of allowing the complexities of Haden's situation to develop, Mr. Crisp merely sends him off on the usual bargain-and-bludgeon escapade through the great cities of Europe. As he searches for his assailant, Haden encounters all of the expected double- and triple-crossers, says all of the expected tough-guy things and even makes love to that old favorite - the attractive female of dubious loyalty whose eyes are ''dark pools.'' This kind of bland stereotyping may not bother a reader who just wants to kill a few hours in the air.

Wrenn was at 21-under-par 195. Ken Green, the 1985 champion, shot 69 on the 7,014-yard Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club course and was in second place. Trevor Dodds shot a 63 for a total of 202. He was tied with Jay Haas. If Wrenn continues his mastery of the course during today's final round, he will erase all tournament records and perhaps some Tour records as well. Green set the Buick Open record when he won with a 20-under 268 in 1985. The 72-hole record for a Tour event is 27 under par, set by Mike Souchak and Ben Hogan. Souchak shot the lowest score, 257, in winning the 1955 Texas Open at Brackenridge Park Golf Course in San Antonio. Hogan won the 1945 Portland Invitational with a 261.(AP) Palmer Five Shots Back: Neil Coles of England continued to dominate the inaugural Senior British Open championship yesterday, shooting a third-round 67 to establish a five-shot lead over Arnold Palmer at Turnberry, Scotland. Coles had a three-under-par round to move to four-under 206. Palmer stayed one over par for the tournament after an even-par 70, ''I felt like I could shoot a really good round today but, in the end, there was really nothing good about the effort,'' he said. ''I putted poorly, hit a lot of bad irons and didn't drive particularly well.'' Peter Butler of England charged into a tie for third place at three-over-par 213 with Bob Charles of New Zealand after shooting his best round so far, a two-under 68. Charles had a 72. Gary Player of South Africa was fifth with 216 after a 72.(AP) Soccer Russians Win in Shootout: Yuri Nikiforov beat Lemmy Isa, the Nigerian goalkeeper, in a penalty-kick shootout yesterday, giving the Soviet Union a 2-1 victory and the under-16 World Cup soccer championship. The match was played in Toronto. With the score tied at 1-1 after extra time, the Soviet squad won the three-of-five-kick shootout, 3-1. In the game for third place, the Ivory Coast defeated Italy, 2-1, in two overtimes Friday night in St. John, New Brunswick. Tennis Lendl Edges Krickstein: Ivan Lendl overcame the steady baseline play of Aaron Krickstein yesterday for a 7-6, 4-6, 6-2 victory in a semifinal match of the Head Classic at Stowe, Vt. After losing the first-set tiebreaker by 7-3, Krickstein broke Lendl's serve two consecutive times to race out to a 4-0 second-set lead. Lendl rallied to close to 5-4, but Krickstein served well in the final game to win the set. In the deciding set, Lendl broke Krickstein in the fourth and 10th games to push his career record against the 19-year-old to 4-0. ''It was good for me to play someone like Aaron today,'' Lendl said. ''He was hitting the ball very well from the baseline and I was able to get a really good workout.'' In today's final, Lendl will meet Jimmy Arias, who defeated Todd Witsken in the other semifinal, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6.(AP) Horse Racing Queen Sees Cauthen Win: Steve Cauthen rode Reference Point, the English Derby winner, to a wire-to-wire victory yesterday in the $320,000 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot, England. The race was viewed by Queen Elizabeth II, who presented the winner's trophy to Louis Freedman, the owner of Reference Point. The 11-to-10 favorite won by three lengths from Celestial Storm with Triptych finishing third for the second successive year, a neck behind Celestial Storm. Nine of Europe's best thoroughbreds started the mile-and-a-half race.(AP) Yachting Swedish Boat Sweeps: The Swedish boat Spirit of Sprite, co-skippered by Per Wermelin and Pelle Petterson, completed an unprecedented six-race sweep yesterday in the world 8-Meter yachting championships off Helsinki, Finland. Petterson had upset Dennis Conner, the America's Cup winner, on Stars & Stripes in the world 12-Meter championship semifinals off Sardinia earlier this month. Golden Feather, skippered by Harry Voss of the United States, was second over all here with 17.7 points after finishing runner-up in five straight races and third in yesterday's finale.

Page 1 President Reagan was involved in a discussion last November that appeared to be intended to obscure key details of the arms sales to Iran after disclosures of the sales began to emerge, according to notes of a high-level White House meeting. 1 News analysis: The hearings into the Iran-contra affair have been more than just an investigation. Many members of Congress also wanted to rally support for legislative influence over American foreign policy. 14 The U.S. is bracing for attacks sponsored by Iran in response to American protection of Kuwaiti tankers, a U.S. official said. U.S. military planners are making a list of targets that could be attacked in retaliation. 1 New sightings of mines were reported by merchant vessels in the Persian Gulf, south of the area where a Kuwaiti tanker flying the American flag and under U.S. naval escort struck a mine Friday. 6 Smuggling rings in Mexico are responsible for the illegal traffic into the U.S. of millions of dollars worth of rare and often endangered wildlife. Officials blame a porous border and ineffective law enforcement. 1 Many U.S. diplomats in Cuba have been spying and plotting to assassinate President Fidel Castro, the Cuban Government is charging in an extensive television and newspaper campaign. 16 Nicaragua has almost completed the longest airfield in Central America, according to U.S. officials, who fear the Soviet Union might use it to extend its reconnaisance missions in this hemisphere. 14 Pakistani heroin in the U.S. and Britain increasingly arrives by an unexpected route, West Africa.

He was 64 years old. 1 The nation's governors issued a report outlining a new philosophy and specific proposals for improving the country's competitive position in the world and reducing gaps in prosperity among regions of the country. 1 George Bush's bid for nomination as his party's presidential candidate remains shaky, despite a clear lead in public support, and money and organizational advantages, according to party leaders and a recent poll. 1 The President assailed a health bill passed by the House to protect the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illness, saying it would impose a heavy new tax on the elderly and could bankrupt Medicare. 20 A Harvard student admitted robbing at least 10 stores and restaurants. His family, friends and pyschiatrists are now trying to understand what transformed the bright Hispanic youth into ''the ski mask bandit.'' 20 The ''Saturday Night Massacre'' of 1973 and the way it was handled may affect the makeup of the Supreme Court, for the man in the middle that night, Robert H. Bork, is now a nominee to fill a critical swing seat. 23 The U.S. crime index rose 6 percent last year to the highest point since 1981. Some of the increase can be attributed to a greater willingness to report crime, but it may suggest that there is more crime over all. 21 Spouses of Soviet citizens who have been denied permission to leave the Soviet Union have formed a coaltion, hoping to make their cause a top human rights issue and an early test of glasnost. 20 Regional 23-27, 35-36 Segregation of Hispanic students is increasing throughout the nation, with New York the most segregated state, according to a new study. The segregation of black students remained almost unchanged between 1972 and 1984. 24 New York's 3,000 nurse practitioners are wondering about the future of their profession as the result of a major legislative defeat.

us,The Story Unfolds,"Sentiment on the Iran-contra committees swung during the week from general skepticism and disapproval of Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter's final testimony on Tuesday to acceptance and praise of Secretary of State George P. Shultz's candor at week's end. Highlights of the week's developments follow. * Admiral Poindexter took issue with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's testimony that he had sent at least five memos asking for Presidential approval of the diversion of Iran arms sales profits to the contras. The memos would have been given to the admiral, and he said he did see the one that has been made public. As for the others, he said: ''I frankly don't think those existed.'' * Many members of the Congressional committees said they did not believe the admiral's version of several key events and were skeptical of the many times he was unable to recall events. The panels released fitness reports from his years in the Navy that said he had a ''photographic memory.'' * The special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair asked the Justice Department to turn over thousands of records from the Justice Department as part of his investigation into the department's much-criticized inquiry into the Iran arms sales in November. A Justice official called the request ''absolutely massive - every scrap of paper from Meese and anybody else in the department.'' Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d will testify before the committees this week or next. * In uncharacteristically blunt and angry testimony, Mr. Shultz said Admiral Poindexter and William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, had deceived him and the President over many months to keep the Iran arms sales alive. When Mr. Shultz finally told the President what was really going on late last year, he said, Mr. Reagan ''was stunned, and he was furious.'' The President reacted ''like he'd been kicked in the belly.'' * Mr. Shultz disputed assertions made over the last six months that he had deliberately kept himself uninformed of the Iran arms deals. He said he had argued forcefully against the program, was overruled and then was lied to as the sales proceeded. He called the arguments within the Cabinet over the policy ''a battle royal.'' * A White House spokesman said President Reagan had found Mr. Shultz's testimony ''honest, sincere and helpful.'' But other White House officials appeared uncomfortable with his portrayal of disarray and factional disputes in the Administration.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Report From the Interior,"Unlike architecture, much in interior design history is fleeting and unrecorded. In contrast to architects, decorators have not traditionally written philosophical treatises on their work -perhaps, C. Ray Smith suggests, because they've never had a philosophy. Then there is the matter of pioneering female decorators like Ruby Ross Wood who, owing to vanity, never divulged their birth dates; all this makes the historian's job trying, at best. In INTERIOR DESIGN IN 20TH-CENTURY AMERICA: A History (Harper & Row, Paper, $24.95), Mr. Smith performs a much-needed service by bringing together the major influences on the way American commercial and residential interiors look today. An author and editor who teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Parsons School of Design in New York City, he takes an admirably broad view, interweaving developments in art, architecture, interiors and product design, including technological innovations like air conditioning and linoleum. Though the book is written in straightforward textbook style - more suitable for the classroom than for bedtime or chaise longue reading - this is an invaluable resource. Nonprofessionals mystified by perennially obtuse design terms will probably find the glossary and pronunciation guide particularly useful. The mostly black-and-white photographs can't do justice to silver-blue foil wallpaper and other passing fancies, but what the book lacks in color it makes up for in details, such as the moment when the decorator Elsie de Wolfe laid eyes on the Parthenon and exclaimed, ''It's beige - just my color!''",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE FLOOD. By Carol Ascher. (Crossing Press, $16.95.) Carol Ascher's first novel attempts to set in motion some powerful themes. The Hoffmans, Jewish refugees from World War II Vienna, have settled in Topeka, Kan., where father David is a doctor at a psychoanalytic hospital. The time is the early 1950's, and Topeka's Brown v. Board of Education suit has brought racial issues into nearly everybody's lives. As told through the voice of David's 9-year-old daughter, Eva, the novel struggles to depict the intellectual isolation of the Hoffmans, their attempts at establishing themselves in the community, and their perspective, as those who have fled Hitler's terror, on racial prejudice in America. Disappointingly, Ms. Ascher's prose does not meet the demands of these complex concerns. When characters debate issues of race and religion, their voices turn as generic and sonorous as symposium panelists. And few exchanges go by without Ms. Ascher describing the gravity of gestures and facial expressions, as though straining to dramatize an urgency the dialogue itself lacks: ''A strange expression, part fear, part hope, worked the muscles of her narrow face,'' or, ''Father's grey eyes blanched in pain behind his wiry glasses.'' The novel's chief weakness, though, is Eva, a girl whose sensibility, in her best moments, is reminiscent of a Carson McCullers heroine. But for the most part Eva remains an obvious foil, an intended innocent whose questions and confusion are meant to make the world's injustices loom even larger. Without the truly animating presence of a real and complex narrator, the book itself remains only a heavy construct of themes.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

As presented here, the reflections of Ann Beattie, Ursula Le Guin, Thomas McGuane, Edmund White and nine others offer an intriguing but one-sided view of American writing today. Larry McCaffery and Sinda Gregory, members of the English department at San Diego State University, note that ''the struggle for greater diversification in fictional forms has been won'' and elicit interesting material on the stylistic experiments contemporary authors feel free to make in the absence of a ''dominant set of conventions.'' The writers' focus on structure is coupled with a general interest in nonliterary sources of inspiration - modern art and music are mentioned as esthetic influences at least as often as any author - and, except for passing comments by Raymond Carver and William Kennedy, there is little acknowledgment that traditional storytelling can also be a vehicle for serious literary concerns. Still, the interviewers' questions are thoughtful, and if many interviewees seem as interested in what they can leave out as what they put in, that in itself tells us much about postmodern literature.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"JADE AND FIRE. By Raymond Barnett. (Random House, $19.95.) It is the Peking of late 1948, the twilight of the Nationalist regime. The monks of the city's largest Taoist monastery burn their prior alive in the courtyard. Bei Menjin, chief inspector of the Peking Municipal Police, tackles the case with a briskness and authority that recalls Thatcher Colt, Anthony Abbot's police commissioner, who solved similar public crimes in 1930's New York. Bei has an assistant, Yuan, who calls him Chief and chirps things like ''No problem'' and ''I'm beginning to like this assignment.'' Complicating matters is the presence of some 200,000 Nationalist troops inside Peking and about half a million well-armed Communists outside the walls. General Fu, Nationalist commander of Peking, takes over the story and educates us on military tactics as taught by Sun Tzu, and on sex, with the help of a beautiful Communist agent from another Taoist monastery. Also in the picture are the murderous thugs of the right wing Te Wu and a fiend who specializes in murdering prostitutes so gruesomely that General Fu's bedroom acrobatics may lose their charm for the reader. We never really care who murdered the shadowy prior and we know how the siege of Peking turned out. Suspense depends on connecting the murder to General Fu's much too obvious predilection to cut a deal with the Communists. The detective-story cliches and stylized Chinese love language clash disastrously and the plot labors to a melodramatic climax that is hard to believe. But the reader will learn a lot about Chinese history, Taoism, tea drinking and Peking art and architecture in this first novel by a California biologist.",1987-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Regan testified that President Reagan felt he had been repeatedly ''snookered'' by Iranians into believing that continued arms sales would lead to the release of more American hostages. Page A1 President Reagan told aides to protect American hostages in Lebanon by limiting disclosure and instead make statements that pointed up inaccuracies in press accounts, according to notes. A10 India said peacekeepers will stay in northern Sri Lanka until New Delhi decides their mission has been completed. Sri Lanka had said the Indian contingent would report to the local commander. A1 A bomb exploded in Johannesburg outside a military barracks. The blast wounded 70 people, including several soldiers, and caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings. A6 A U.S. helicopter crashed into the Persian Gulf, killing one man and leaving three missing, military officials said. The copter was not under attack, and officials offered no explanation for the accident. A3 The Kremlin accused U.S. diplomats of fomenting demonstrations by Cri-mean Tatars. Several hundred Tatars have staged demonstrations in Moscow seeking to return to Crimea, from which they were deported by Stalin in 1944. A3 Kenneth L. Adelman is resigning as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He expressed satisfaction that Washington and Moscow were moving toward a ban on medium-range and shorter-range arms. A3 Britain's top court barred the press from reporting the memoirs of Peter Wright, a retired intelligence agent, even though his book is available in London, fresh from an American publisher. A1 Mexican plane crashes; 39 die A3 U.S. reconsiders Panama aid A3 London journal A4 Israeli proposes ouster of Arabs A5 National A12-13, B6-8, B20 Abortion counseling would be barred from Federal funding in family planning clinics under new rules proposed by President Reagan. Mr. Reagan has repeatedly failed to win Congressional approval of measures to ban abortions. A1 The abortion rules proposed by President Reagan could severely limit the services provided by more than 4,000 clinics that receive Federal funds, according to family planning professionals. B8 Newly found natural antibiotics first detected in frogs apparently kill a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, parasites and possibly viruses. The antibiotics hold promise of treating many human infections. A1 Foreign investors are helping to push American stock market indexes to historic highs, according to traders and experts. They credited not only the Japanese, but also Europeans and Australians. A1 Leading indicators rose in June for the fifth consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported. The gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent was slightly higher than had been generally expected. D1 The nation's poverty rate eased last year to 13.6 percent, the lowest level since President Reagan took office, the Census Bureau reported. A bureau official acknowledged a rise in income inequality. A12 The President will be hospitalized today to have a skin cancer removed from the tip of his nose, the White House said. Experts say such cancers are almost never life-threatenting and are easy to cure by cutting away the cancerous skin. A1 Testing for the AIDS virus would be greatly expanded on a voluntary basis with strict civil rights guarantees under legislation introduced by Congressional leaders, backed by many major health groups. A12 A new spending cut mechanism for the budget balancing law that could put off major decisions on the deficit and tax increases until after the 1988 elections has been endorsed by Senate Democratic and Republican leaders. A12 The fabled King Ranch is struggling through one of the toughest eras in its 134-year history. The vast South Texas ranch has laid off or given early retirement to more than half of its employees. A1 Washington Talk B6 M.I.A.'s and the politics of hope Acid rain lobby stirs debate Byrd assails Reagan's stance A12 Minutes with Kemp without Kemp B7 Computers replace coziness for Republicans in Iowa B7 Significance seen in Guam disease B20 Regional B1-5 New York's biggest crack ring was broken, officials said. A Federal indictment named 29 people, including a 26-year-old Dominican identified as the leader. The authorities said the group distributed up to 10,000 vials of crack a day, primarily in Washington Heights and the Bronx. B1 Oxygen levels are dangerously low in several parts of western Long Island Sound and constitute a serious threat to the region's fishing industry, according to scientists and environmental offficials. B2 A labor leader will serve as a temporary ''observer'' on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority until Governor Cuomo appoints a permanent member. Labor leaders said Sonny Hall would be the observer because Mr. Cuomo refused to appoint another leader, Victor Gotbaum, to the seat. B3 A bill to enhance jury service by raising the daily pay to $15 and doubling to four years the time between summonses had been endorsed by court officials but was vetoed by Governor Cuomo as too costly. B3 Sharply higher garbage disposal fees in the 22 municipalities in Essex County, N.J., were approved by state regulators. An official said the soaring charges represented a major emergency. B2 A jury cited hopeless deadlock on charges that three reputed Mafia figures had slain a police detective on a Queens street. After nine days of deliberation the jury foreman said the vote was 9 to 3 for acquittal.

Three-course prix-fixe $30. Entrees $13.50 to $29.50. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 and 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.; Sundays, 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.

The best appetizers are panfried Peking dumplings filled with well-seasoned pork; thin slices of duck with spicy Hunan sauce, and sliced kidneys with ginger, hot pepper and soy sauce. Main-dish options include freshwater prawns sauteed with rice wine, ginger, scallions and oyster sauce; lemon chicken, and red-cooked duck, which is marinated in soy sauce and sugar, fried to crisp the skin and served over a bed of sauteed spinach.

With what, my friend, Shall we comfort ourselves This winter time when our fields are frozen? Is our great land still livable? Is the land still as beautiful as silks? That's a lie; that is a lie. We are serfs, scarecrows Lending our ears silently to lies In a pretense of knowing nothing every day And having to tolerate whips that cut our bones. Crying out in our own dear language, Why don't we make azaleas, azaleas, azaleas Come alive and bloom out of this frozen land, Blooming all over the paddies? My friend, Why don't we have our sad winter Spoken of, time and time again? And mustn't we, shackled tight, struggle on To the last, while waiting for the spring, My friend? DAILY INSPECTION OF THE SCENE OF THE CRIME By Hwang Chi U (Translated by Sol Sun Bong) Yesterday I came back with stakes driven into my ears. Today I installed a fence of barbed wire over my eyes And bound it with bandage. Tomorrow I will throw a scoop of dirt into my mouth And plug it with a ball of cotton. Day after day, Night after night, I bury a part of me In order to annihilate the evidence of my living In order to obtain my survival. DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN AMERICAN DOG AND A KOREAN DOG By Mun Bong Ran Korean dog: Hello, American dog. Your country is a bizarre society, a dogs' paradise, where dogs live luxuriously; How ridiculous that a dog's life is pampered, while your neighbors like El Salvador have no human rights. Our master's country has been trampled by Yan- kees, Japanese and Russians who divided the territory. Hello, American dog. We are willing to sacrifice our lives for our master. We are happy. We can't un- derstand civilized Americans putting the rights of dogs over those of people. Murderous human- ism! Goodbye, happy American dog.

According to the young William Shakespeare in ''Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' love leaves one ''metamorphosed,'' ''humbled,'' ''deformed.'' Lovers are driven to betray their friends, defy their parents, write bad poetry, and, in general, to behave with a great deal less decorum than the play's one indisputably chaste character, the sour dog Crab. In Stuart Vaughan's staging at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, the smitten young men and women of Verona and Milan are every bit as silly as Shakespeare intended them to be, and yet, for all their incontestable inanity, they are impossible to dislike. Mr. Vaughan understands that the playwright is sending up romance, not excoriating it. By opting for a light touch and a youthful, guileless acting company, the director uncorks the fresh humors of a comedy in which innocence, rather than love, can conquer all.",1987-07-31T05:00:00+0000
