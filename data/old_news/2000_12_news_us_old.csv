Shuts Down Chat Room," WASHINGTON -- The CIA has fired four employees and reprimanded dozens of others for participating in a secret chat room hidden in the agency's computer system, The Washington Post reported Friday. The newspaper said the disciplinary action was described as the largest in the agency's history, and followed a seven-month investigation that involved 160 employees and delved into activities going back 15 years. The CIA issued a statement that said the investigation found no ``unauthorized disclosure of classified information.'' A memo to all employees said investigators uncovered ``a concerted and sustained effort on the part of a group of individuals to create, maintain and hide databases on the agency's computer systems.'' The agency's statement said four employees were stripped of security clearances, ``rendering them ineligible for continued CIA employment,'' the Post reported. Eighteen others received letters of reprimand. ``Most of them will be suspended without pay for periods ranging from five to 45 days,'' the agency said. Nine contractors also were stripped of security clearances, which means they cannot work on CIA contracts, the statement said. Seventy-nine other CIA employees with ``minimal involvement'' in the computer scheme received either warning letters or security briefings. But former CIA employees with firsthand knowledge of the secret chat rooms told the newspaper that the disciplinary actions were an overreaction by CIA management. Ross Stapleton-Gray, a former CIA analyst who participated in the covert communications channels when he worked at the agency from 1988 to 1994, said those involved were primarily computer-savvy employees who enjoyed a sense of community with other ``techies.'' The agency said the first secret chat room was created as an ``unofficial user's group'' on the CIA's mainframe computer in the mid-1980s. ``Over the years, as the agency migrated to new information systems, the hidden databases were moved to take advantage of these new systems,'' the statement said.

us,Album of the Week,"THE OFFSPRING: ''Conspiracy of One'' (Columbia). Commercial fortunes aside, Southern California punk-pop hasn't changed much since the early 1980's. That was when the Descendents bonded the catchiness and the momentum of the Ramones to the complaints of bored, restless, misunderstood suburban teenagers. The Offspring keep cranking out snappy three-minute songs that ricochet amid resentment, pep talks and sarcastic humor: this time 12 of them fit on a 37-minute album. ''Conspiracy of One'' slightly varies the formula by tilting toward hard rock in a few songs and shamelessly aping Nirvana in another; it also tosses some Latin percussion into ''Original Prankster.'' The power chords signal that the songs are less flippant than before; Dexter Holland sings about unfocused rage, romantic misfires and his own unpredictable mood swings. For comic relief, there are songs about a riot as a boys' day out, about stalking and about wishing a too nice girlfriend would develop a bad attitude and get some tattoos. The fast tempos and brash guitars go a long way toward dissolving the Offspring's growing biliousness. JON PARELES",2000-12-01T05:00:00+0000

In the past decade he has probably ferreted out and published more classified information than anyone else in America. His string of politically slanted yet often authentically embarrassing scoops about the inner workings of the Clinton administration's foreign policy have frequently driven those in power to distraction. Indeed, as Gertz acknowledges, he is widely believed to be the primary target of recent legislation, passed by both houses of Congress but vetoed by the president, that would have made it a felony to leak classified information to the press.

And this, in turn, made less of Ross -- in the eyes of many New Yorker veterans, painfully less -- because it turned him from the great and farseeing editor they knew into a kind of hapless Thurber husband who lucked out by hiring Thurber. For those who think that Ross really was like Stengel -- a superb manager of talents who skillfully hid his shrewd judgment behind an assumed mask of colorfulness -- it is easy to see Thurber's Ross as a caricature, or even a betrayal.",2000-12-03T05:00:00+0000

When Japan's economy collapsed in 1989, unemployment, unheard of in the country's postwar boom, hit hard, jumping from 1 percent then to 5 percent today. Though the saddest effect of the cataclysm is Japan's rising suicide rate, its strangest is the number of former salarymen who haunt the business districts of downtown Tokyo, unable to stay home or in their neighborhoods between the morning and evening rush hours. These men -- and they are all men -- are the newly unemployed. They are as elusive as body snatchers, rising early every day, donning white shirts and knotting their ties before setting out for jobs they no longer have. Some have not yet found a way to tell their wives and families the bad news. Others are afraid their neighbors will find out.

Following Mr. Perkin's death in 1969, Gladys Perkin devoted her life to philanthropy. As Chairman of The Perkin Fund, she supported the American Museum of Natural History, The Boston Academy of Music, Harvard's Center for Blood Research, The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, The Juilliard School, The New England Conservatory, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Norwalk Hospital, Rockefeller University, The Waveny Care Center and The Wildlife Conservation Society.

The dissolution of the Soviet empire, first of all, opened a tremendous number of lead-lined rooms. We now know where various bodies are buried, who spied and for whom and what they transmitted.

us,Children's Books; Peace Among the Animals,"Here is BEAR NOEL, written and illustrated by Olivier Dunrea (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16; ages 4 to 8), a calming book for a season that is anything but calm. A huge and jovial Bear Noel tromps through the north woods, bringing Christmas to the animals -- Hare and Wolf, Fox and Boar, Hedgehog and Possum. A refrain, repeated on each page as each new animal is alerted, is perfect for read-aloud merriment: ''He is getting nearer. . . . He is laughing. . . . He is coming (whispered). . . . Who is coming? . . . Bear Noel!'' (shouted). The full beauty of Olivier Dunrea's book, however, is in the details. Snow falls from the top of every page into the oblivion of the snow-white bottom, sometimes gently yet other times so briskly we can see the eyes and face of Fox braced against the cold. The snow is thick and seemingly untouched, covering every branch and rock, but there is still a hint of green moss on the side of a tree and evergreens darkly etched against the night sky. The snow ''shimmers and sparkles'' on the trees but lies ''hushed and silent'' on the frozen ground. Dunrea matches word to image as each sensuous illustration expands across the page. For a brief moment, the snow stops as the animals feast at the small tree Bear Noel has decorated with berries and nuts and seed balls. For a brief moment, says Bear Noel, ''All creatures may come together without fear.'' It is Christmas Eve. Hare stands on the back of Wolf. Fox protects Hedgehog. Bear Noel jingles his bells. Here is the message of peace the season is meant to convey. On the last page, we see only Bear Noel silently disappearing into the snow. Does the peace among the animals last? Could it? There is an unspoken invitation for the child to wonder. Bear Noel is as simple, complex and elegant a story as each single snowflake. Karen Leggett",2000-12-03T05:00:00+0000

In a conference with analysts, who are still smarting after the company missed expectations by 10 cents a share last month, Carleton S. Fiorina, the Hewlett chief executive, acknowledged that investor confidence was clearly shaken and outlined plans to improve performance. She said last quarter's unanticipated earnings shortfall was galvanizing; she and several other executives did not receive bonuses for the second half of the year, and the retirements of several managers were accelerated. The company had anticipated a major slowdown in personal computer sales and focused in higher-margin products, including network servers and storage machines. The guidance is based on a predictions of a soft landing, or gradual slowing of the economy, she said. A major recession would probably force Hewlett-Packard to revise its guidance.

Then the tents were deemed too expensive to maintain, raise and move, and the circus began performing only in arenas. In the 70's, the Big Apple Circus proved tents were viable, even in New York City, and along came other one-ring tent shows (Cirque du Soleil, Zingaro) to prove it. So it seemed time for Ringling Brothers, too, to get back under canvas. This year it has raised a new circus tent in Bryant Park. Todd Dalland, a founder of FTL Happold of Manhattan, the tent's designers, said his company ''eliminated the side poles, the guy ropes and the stakes.''

The trustees, staff, fellows, and extended family of the Asian Cultural Council are deeply saddened by the loss of Porter McCray, who for so many years was such an extraordinary colleague, mentor, and friend. Porter was a cultural advisor to members of several generations of the Rockefeller family, and between 1947 and 1961 he developed and directed the domestic and international circulating exhibition programs at The Museum of Modern Art. In 1963 he was appointed founding director of The JDR 3rd Fund (now the Asian Cultural Council), a foundation which was created by John D. Rockefeller 3rd to promote cultural exchanges in the visual and performing arts between Asia and the United States and which Porter led with remarkable vision, dedication, and care. The uniquely effective model of grantmaking that Porter established nearly forty years ago continues to form the basis of our work at the Asian Cultural Council today. Throughout a brilliant professional career in the cultural and philanthropic worlds that spanned more than six decades, Porter was a tireless and enthusiastic champion of many of the most talented artists and arts specialists of our time, and the lives of countless individuals here and abroad have been profoundly touched by his great generosity, encouragement, and advice. An inveterate international traveler and superb connoisseur, Porter will also always be remembered as a true gentleman whose impeccable manners and unfailing good taste set a wonderful example for all who knew him.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MALLORY, CLIFFORD DAY, JR.","MALLORY-Clifford Day, Jr. The Trustees and Staff of Mystic Seaport, The Museum of America and the Sea, are deeply saddened by the passing of Clifford Mallory. Cliff served the Museum during virtually his entire adult life, becoming a Trustee in 1940 and continually serving until his death on December 7, 2000. During his sixty years on the Board, Cliff held numerous committee and officer positions and served as President from 1976 to 1984 and Chairman of the Board from 1984 to 1988. More important, however, than the positions he held was the impact he had on the Museum and all associated with it through his extraordinary personality. People were naturally drawn to Cliff and his enthusiasm for life and his interests was contagious. For all of us at Mystic Seaport, Cliff was our last link with the earliest days of the Museum which was founded in 1929. Cliff knew the three founders and all those who have led and shaped the Museum through the years. His father and uncle preceded him as President and his son and son-in-law currently serve as Trustees, continuing the family tradition. This involvement in preserving America's maritime history is logical because of the remarkable role the Mallorys have played in that history. The family has been continuously involved in the maritime industry in America since 1816 as sail makers, ship builders, ship owners and shipping brokers. This nearly 200 years of contributions to our maritime heritage was a point of real pride to Cliff who made his impact as head of C.D. Mallory and Company and through his work on behalf of Mystic Seaport. We send our most sincere sympathies to his wife Pauline Cropper Mallory, his daughters Diana Gros Louis and Veronica Stubbs, his son Charles Mallory, his seven grandchildren and his sister Barbara Hathaway and her family.

The rate for chlamydia has soared to 264.1 per 100,000 since 1984, when it was 6.6 per 100,000. Gonorrhea declined from the mid-1970's until the mid-1990's. But it rose 9 percent between 1997 and 1999. Federal health officials said the new figures should send a wake-up call about infections that can lead to infertility, tubal pregnancies and an increased risk of H.I.V. transmission. Meanwhile, syphilis rates reached a record low. Lawrence K. Altman",2000-12-10T05:00:00+0000

Or, of course, a former president of the United States. That lack of intrusion from the outside world might make for restless presidents, but it makes photographers look inward for inspiration. Laub's very personal photographs often feature her grandparents (her mother's side are the Yasgurs of Woodstock, while her dad's side has a Golden Gloves champion), and are often taken on the grounds of her family's house in Chappaqua, not far from where the Clintons are moving full time. But then, nothing is far from anything in Chappaqua. There's a Starbucks now (the Tiazzi drink ordered by President Clinton recently became a quick best seller, and Hillary's photo is posted in the shop), and there are now a few restaurants, most of which have had Clinton sightings.",2000-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Code of the Slammer,"Edward Bunker's gritty prison novel, THE ANIMAL FACTORY (St. Martin's Minotaur, paper, $11.95), originally published in 1977, rings with an unsurprising authenticity. The author was in and out of the California penal system for 18 years and spent time in San Quentin, where he was first incarcerated as a baby-faced 17-year-old. Now the former bank robber and forger has become a cult icon of sorts, championed by filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, who cast him in ''Reservoir Dogs,'' and Steve Buscemi, who adapted this book for a recent movie. Bunker's criminal past is embroidered into this melodrama about a handsome young middle-class cocaine dealer, Ronald Decker, who is sent to San Quentin for 10 years to life. Immediately beset by menacing suitors, Ron finds protection through a vaguely homoerotic father-son relationship with Earl Copen, a hard-timer who knows as much about Celine and Dostoyevsky as he does about scams and shivs. Both men are caught in prison's classic double bind: to get parole they have to play by the rules, but to stay alive they ''must follow the codes of the underworld.'' Of course, after a dehumanizing year of witnessing race wars, casual murder and sexual slavery, Ron is an animal who violently determines his chances, and Earl's, with the inevitability of Greek tragedy -- It had never been a matter of real choice,'' Earl says. Bunker, who is also the author of a memoir titled ''Education of a Felon,'' writes in plain, sometimes clumsy prose, yet his oddly honorable bad guys have a rich emotional complexity. His digressions on penal reform are impassioned, if redundant. What armchair gangsters will most enjoy are the details about prison culture -- from the price of a life in cigarettes to how inmates communicate through the toilet ''telephone'' system.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Shinier Than Now,"Long after the heyday of Hollywood portrait photographers like George Hurrell, and long before the tyranny of paparazzi who stalk stars like bloodhounds, there was Murray Garrett. Garrett was barely 20 years old when he moved from New York to Hollywood, camera in hand, and established himself as a photojournalist for publications like Time, Life and Look. HOLLYWOOD CANDID: A Photographer Remembers (Abrams, $35) consists of 150 of his favorite black-and-white images. Never are they as studied or opulent as Hurrell's and rarely as hurried or invasive as the paparazzi's; they are congenial, a pleasant time tunnel back to the 50's, when stars still welcomed ''at-home'' photo shoots. Often the shots are humorous, luminous and, at best, revealing. Joan Crawford is depicted, without makeup and looking strangely sweet, on a radio sound stage; Jane Wyman is shown radiant at hearing raves for her performance in ''Johnny Belinda''; Ava Gardner is photographed laughing with the kind of naturalness she never showed on screen. Garrett's accompanying remarks provide the book's real snap. True, you must wade through a river of celebrity pap to find the sharp and juicy, but then you discover a cutting anecdote about Shelley Winters (''Anyone meeting Shelley for the first time will find her very funny, but as many directors and actors could tell you, the amusement doesn't last long'') or a nasty remark from Bob Hope, whispered to Garrett during a break in a television program (''Five minutes away from Milton Berle is like a month in the country''). In the end, Garrett and his subjects share something important in common: they are most compelling when they are most candid. Marjorie Rosen",2000-12-10T05:00:00+0000

An autopsy revealed that he died from a combination of alcohol and a heart defect. Justice Hubsher said a college is not legally bound to guarantee the well-being of its students.

Now, part-time teachers, who have doctoral or master's degrees and constitute much of the faculty, earn about $2,000 per course, for an annual income of $12,000 to $16,000. They have no benefits, no job security and no chance of promotion. Few possess the energy, funds or institutional support to develop scholarly reputations in their fields.

I'm Squash Roll because I harbor an antipathy toward anything raw and so opt for squash inside my sushi. I'm Squash Roll because Andrew and his brother and business partner, Albert, have nicknames for everyone. The sushi-making experience of Albert and Andrew Co is apparent; they have worked as sushi chefs since their first week in America nine years ago and they have owned Sakura Express for the last four years. Their humor -- tagging my always turned-out roommate High Maintenance or a Russian physicist the Russian Spy -- is equally apparent. Begun as an offshoot of Sakura House, a sit-down restaurant in Princeton Shopping Center that was owned by the Cos' aunt, Sakura Express is now an independent enterprise with a loyal following of its own. It's not big, with seating for 25 on stools at a few tables or along a windowsill counter. Andrew estimates that he knows 60 to 70 percent of the people who walk through the door. And a lot of people walk through the door; the brothers roll 900 pieces of sushi a day, spooning out 250 pounds of rice a week. Favorites include California rolls ($3.50 for six), salmon ($1.50 each) and yellowtail tuna ($1.75 each). For people squeamish about sushi (and for whom even squash won't do) there is chicken teriyaki ($4.95) and shrimp tempura ($5.95). Miso soup, salad and rice are available as sides.

After receiving an M.A. in education from the University of Massachusetts, she briefly taught school; but soon turned to social work as her career. She received an MSW from Fordham University and spent 25 years at St. Vincent's Services in Brooklyn, working first on the development of their Foster Boarding Program, and from 1980 to 1992, serving as Director of the Agency's Foster Care and Adoption Services. As the number of children served by St. Vincent's Services grew, she never lost sight of the individual entrusted to her care. Her Director's door was always open to those children and families in need of her counsel or intervention. Her friends will miss her caring nature, her ready response to their needs, her wise counsel and her fun-loving sense of humor. A gifted communicator and speaker, she was cruelly deprived of speech by her illness, but she adapted to the Internet to maintain contact with her friends and family, which was so important to her and to them.

Born in New York City, August 8, 1906, Mr. Thon was a World War II veteran. He has resided in Port Clyde since the 1940's. For several years, Mr. Thon worked with Consolidated Edison Electric Company in New York City, where he met the love of his life Helen Elizabeth whom he married June 3, 1929 in New York City. Mrs. Thon died November 20, 1999. Having previously purchased land in Port Clyde, in 1946, the Thon's built their home in which Mr. Thon still resided. He enjoyed the closeknit community and considered his neighbors family. In 1947, Mr. Thon traveled to Rome, where he had been honored with Membership in the American Academy of Arts. While living in Rome, he traveled with his wife to Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Rhodes. With gradual loss of sight due to Macular Degeneration, Mr. Thon stated at the time of his wife's death that, ''In recent years, she became my eyes and during her illness, I became her strength.'' He found satisfaction in sharing his art with others, painting what he saw through his own eyes. Mr. Thon received the Prix de Rome in 1947 and in 1948 a Fellowship from The American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his numerous awards are First Prize from the Brooklyn Museum in 1941 and 1944, distinctions from The National Academy of Design, Gold Medals from the American Watercolor Society in 1970 and 1978, State of Maine Award and Citation from Governor Kenneth Curtis in 1970, and a Silver Medal from The Audobon Society in 1986.

His work has been featured in solo exhibitions at The Smith College Museum of Art, The Fort Wayne Museum, Bates College, The Farnsworth Art Museum and in many group exhibitions throughout the United States.

Honeywell also reiterated that its fourth-quarter profit would be below forecasts. The company said it would take as much as $425 million in pretax charges in the period, partly because of a decision to cancel the sale of some units after the $45 billion deal with G.E. was made. The revisions come less than two months after John F. Welch Jr., the chief executive of G.E., broke up a merger between Honeywell and the United Technologies Corporation. Mr. Welch said at the time that the addition of Honeywell would be too good to pass up, and he forecast $1.5 billion in annual savings. The purchase will add 11 cents a share to profit in the first year, and 17 cents in the third year after the acquisition is completed, even if there is no growth at the Honeywell businesses, Mr. Welch said on a conference call.

He spoke of improving health care and retirement security and a determination to ''address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time.'' Republicans and Democrats can use the same words to mean different things, of course. But in using the word ''bipartisan'' three times and ''together'' 12 times, Mr. Bush seemed determined to reintroduce himself as someone who would come up with social and economic policies that draw support from both sides of the Capitol.",2000-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Freedom and Poetry,"For more than 40 years, Carolyn Kizer has used poetry as an outlet for her humanistic, liberal ethos. She was a feminist practically before the term existed, and she has consistently spoken out against injustice both in her work and in her life. As a result, COOL, CALM & COLLECTED: Poems 1960-2000 (Copper Canyon, $30) provides an opportunity to look back not only at her career, but at the recent social and political history of America. She covers civil rights, women's rights and almost everything in between, but even when she's writing about more intimate matters, her underlying concern is freedom. One of the earliest poems in the book, ''The Worms,'' is about a child walking over the worm-strewn ground after a rainstorm, viscerally aware of ''Trying not to wound / anything alive; / Most especially / Not to maim the self / By any kind of death.'' It's an innocent desire that can't last, of course, a bitter truth Kizer gets to in her long poem from the 1960's, ''Pro Femina.'' ''I take as my theme 'The Independent Woman,' ''she writes. And then she adds, pointedly, ''Independent but maimed.'' Despite her constant railing against the machine, however, Kizer's poetry remains fundamentally optimistic, perhaps because she seems to love existence almost in spite of herself. ''Observe the world with desperate affection,'' she wrote in the 70's. This collection, which includes translations from a dizzying number of foreign poets, is ample proof that she's spent a lifetime taking her own good advice. Melanie Rehak",2000-12-17T05:00:00+0000

''This collection should finally establish him for what he is: Bruce Jay Friedman, sui generis and no mean thing.''

Sharon McGinley has taken a safe approach in pairing her vibrant illustrations with the traditional carol THE FRIENDLY BEASTS (Greenwillow, $15.95; ages 3 to 8), a telling of the Nativity that's sure to interest young children because it gives the animals of the manger star billing. And McGinley's beasts are nothing if not friendly: the donkey that tells us he brought the pregnant Mary ''uphill and down; I carried her safely to Bethlehem town'' has the sloe-eyed gaze and moppet hair of a fifth Beatle, while the stolid cows and smiling sheep cavort with flying fish, striped snakes and even a stray alligator in a checkered collar. McGinley shows far less imagination with her rather bland Holy Family, but by the time magi and angels join the crowded menagerie, there's enough action to keep any child entertained until the pudding is served.

Loosely based on the Ten Commandments, the cycle's 10 fables, set in and around a Warsaw housing development, ponder the meaning of life and death, morality and the existence of God. Kieslowski's skeptical, open-ended vision suggests that the answers can be intuited only from riddles, signs, portents and sudden, odd strokes of fate. For all its somberness, the individual stories are extremely entertaining. And the visionary realism of this Polish filmmaker, who died four years ago, invests the most mundane objects with a luminous metaphysical weight and an awareness of the interconnectedness of things.",2000-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  COLE, DOLI","COLE-Doli. Of Ridgewood, NJ. Daughter of Mireille Guzelbahar Axelrad of Boca Raton, FL and the late Robert Guzelbahar, wife of Morrill Cole and mother of Amy Ellen Cole of Cliffside Park and Robert Cole of Fort Lee, NJ died on Friday at Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York City. She is survived, also by her beloved grandchildren, Danielle and Adam, the children of Robert and Ronit Cole and by her sister, Emel Glicksman of New York City and her nieces, Cindy Touma of Tenafly, NJ and Sally Rosen and Nina Rosen both of New York City. A fashion designer and lifelong tennis player, she pioneered in the design of tennis apparel that combined a strong fashion statement with practical, active wearability in the movements of the game. She brought companies into the tennis wear business that had previously had no connection with the tennis world. She designed for Profile Skiwear, Spalding, Champion and other sportswear and hard goods companies. Her business, Lovestitch, printed a classic ALine tennis dress pattern on fabric that permitted the home sewer to cut and sew her own dress. The design and wearability of the dresses were so successful that her customers prevailed on her to go further and manufacture the finished dress for ready to wear sales. She was born in Istanbul, Turkey. In 1954, she participated in a Turkish government assignment as a translator and model on the Turkish good-will ship, the Tarsis, that travelled the Western Hemisphere to introduce modern Westernized Turkish culture and post war economic progress to the American marketplace. Her marriage to New Jersey attorney Morrill Cole followed her disembarkation in New York. Fluent in many languages, she was a graduate of Roberts College in Istanbul and attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. She was an active member of the Upper Ridgewood Tennis Club until her illness took her from the courts. She was a member of Honors, the bridge club in New York. Her family would appreciate contributions to the Evelyn Lauder Breast Center at Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital, 205 East 64th Street, NY NY 10021 in honor of the pioneering and humane work of Dr. Larry Norton and his associate Dr. Pamela Munster. Funeral services will be held at Barnert Memorial Temple, Rt. 208 in Franklin Lakes on Monday, December 18 at 12 noon.

That was the burden of ''Love and Death in the American Novel,'' the brilliant jeremiad, psychoanalysis and genealogy of the genre by the literary critic Leslie Fiedler. We don't have adultery in America, Fiedler observed -- or not in classic American literature, at any rate. For that matter, we don't have much marriage, either. Among the books canonized as the American Renaissance, only ''The House of the Seven Gables'' ends with a wedding. ''The quest which has distinguished our fiction,'' Fiedler wrote, ''is the search for an innocent substitute for adulterous passion and marriage alike.'' He regretted the absence of heterosexual passion; he thought our tradition was poorer and tamer without it. The classic novels of the United States, he lamented, are ''notoriously at home in the children's section of the library.''",2000-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Thousands of lenses were trained on King's public journey, which began when the personable young Baptist minister emerged as the charismatic leader of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and reached its apex at the March on Washington in 1963. Short, not handsome, battling a tendency to put on extra pounds, King was physically unimpressive except when he stepped before a microphone and the oratory flowed. The novelist Charles Johnson contributes a masterly elegiac text that does not paper over the philosophical differences between King's sustained vision of peaceful interracial cooperation and the vocal advocates of black power who claimed national attention in his last years. This pictorial history originated with the photographer Bob Adelman, whose own work is well represented. The decision to put the copyright credits on the final page makes it a task to determine which photographer captured which memorable image. Photographers played a significant role in the civil rights struggle. Their names deserved more prominent placement. Susan Brownmiller",2000-12-17T05:00:00+0000

The traditional Scottish wraparound has been discovered by hipsters of Scottish descent and by fashion's forward guard. At the Christian Dior fall show, John Galliano sent a sequined kilt down the runway, and the Burberry designer, Roberto Menichetti, had men in tartan wool kilts in his fall show. The artist Damian Loeb, left, borrowed a kilt from Burberry to wear to an art event this fall. The musician Donovan Leitch has been spotted in one at many a fashion fete. Kyle MacLachlan donned a little plaid number for a recent episode of ''Sex and the City.'' And the director Guy Ritchie is expected to wear a floor-length kilt in the Hunting MacIntosh tartan when he marries Madonna this week. Who knows if kilts will ever replace jeans, but Burberry introduced its line of men's kilts this month, in its signature nova check plaid ($775), and it has already sold out. Anyone who calls to be put on the waiting list (212-371-5010) can order a custom kilt in his family's colors; there's an ancestry directory at the store at 9 East 57th Street. For those in the Stewart clan, which is linked to royalty, the tartan is a mix of green and red, perfect for Christmas. KAREN ROBINOVITZ",2000-12-17T05:00:00+0000

SET FOR HYBRID BUS ORDER,"At a meeting today, the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to approve an order for 200 hybrid electric buses that will be used in the five boroughs, Gov. George E. Pataki announced in a written statement yesterday. New York City Transit already operates 10 such buses, the largest fleet of electric buses in the country, said Albert O'Leary, a spokesman for the transit agency. He said 130 others were already scheduled for delivery next year, when the transit agency plans to increase bus service by 5 percent. The 200 new buses, whose electric power is replenished by small diesel motors, would be delivered in 2003. Mr. O'Leary said that the hybrid buses burn at least as cleanly as buses fueled by compressed natural gas, and as new technology is developed, their diesel motors could be replaced by even cleaner fuel cells. The new buses, which will cost $77 million, will be built in New York State by Orion Bus Industries in Oriskany and BAE Systems in Johnson City. ''These buses will pay important health dividends by dramatically reducing bus emissions on the streets of New York, while helping provide good-paying jobs upstate,'' Mr. Pataki said, calling the purchase the largest order of hybrid electric buses in North America.

His stories of the great artists and his vast knowledge of operas, especially those of Richard Strauss, enthralled generations of singers. Always with a twinkle in his eye, he has been there to support, advise, chide, cajole and cheer the success of his many students and friends. He leaves a void that cannot be filled. Our deepest condolences go to his wife Doris and his son Richard. The funeral service will be on Wednesday, December 20 at 11:15 am, at Riverside Memorial Chapels, 180 West 76th Street, NYC.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  BUCY, ODETTA (GREER)","BUCY-Odetta (Greer), was born on October 25, 1931, on a farm in Grassland, Texas, 11 miles east of Tahoka, to her parents Wesley Robert Greer and Nannie Josephine Bargsley Greer and passed away on December 15, 2000. In addition to helping with the chores on the farm, she also enjoyed athletics, becoming the captain of her high school basketball team. She first caught the eye of her future husband, J. Fred Bucy, Jr., when she was nine years old and he was twelve. He sold her a double dip ice cream cone for half price at a nickel at the drug store where he worked. They married six years later and supported each other by farming before heading off to college at Texas Tech. They then moved to the University of Texas in Austin where he obtained his Master's Degree and she attended college. Upon his graduation, they moved to Dallas to begin her husband's career at Texas Instruments. While raising and nurturing three children, she also supported her husband in his career as he rose to become president and CEO of Texas Instruments. While living in West Texas, Austin, Houston and Dallas, Odetta made lifelong friends that are devoted to her to this day. She traveled around the world many times but was never happier than at home or combing the beach in Port Aransas for shark's teeth with her children and eventually grandchildren. She took the greatest joy in life whether bowling with her girlfriends, sailing through the Bahamas or beating her family in games of Scrabble. Her joy in life was tested when she was struck with cancer at the age of 60. Though her doctors believed she had only six months to live, her spirit and determination and the devotion of her husband, gave the gift of nine beautiful years to her family and friends. She was able to win her battle with cancer, but finally succumbed to a weakened heart. Even during her illness, she lived her life with joy and enthusiasm, never showing a hint of despair or regret. She showed us how to live life to the fullest and how to leave this world with the utmost dignity and grace. She leaves behind her husband of 54 years, J. Fred Bucy, Jr; her son, J. Fred Bucy, III, two daughters, Roxanne Coogan and Diane Gruber; two sons-in-law, Keith Coogan and Mike Gruber; six grandchildren, Joshua Bucy, Patrick Coogan, Michael Gruber, Becky Gruber, and Chris Gruber, a sister, Opal Greer Ray and many nieces and nephews. We will miss her dearly. Services will be 10:30 AM, Wednesday December 20, 2000 in the Main Sanctuary at Lovers Lane United Methodist Church, 9200 Inwood Road, Dallas, Texas, Rev.

His sensitivity, caring and love for us have been an abiding source of pride and example. Those same sentiments he dedicated to the larger world of work and country. He entered the work world early, interesting himself in the needs and problems of working people, knowing the necessity and broad social benefit of better working conditions for them and for the country. For the good of the country and the justness of the cause, he joined the Army during World War II, at the age of 37, contributing to the freedom effort as a skilled glider pilot. Upon discharge, he returned both to the movie industry and the union movement that he loved so much. With his protean energy and unique determination, he achieved much in the struggle for dignified wages and working conditions for all workers including women, minorities and the foreign born. In April of 2000, at age 90, he retired as president of local 306 of the International Alliance of Theatrical and State Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada (IATSE). For many years, his siblings, friends and union associates have enjoyed his gentle friendship, his great courage, and his extraordinary vision and dedication.

Consider, for example, the freshness of a penthouse extension by Lorcan O'Herlihy Architects of Los Angeles in a 1950's house for Dan Nathanson and Chandi Chapman. ''A house has a potential to engage the city,'' said Mr. O'Herlihy (above right). ''There are ways of participating by way of deckings and platforms.'' In this case, Mr. O'Herlihy engaged his Hollywood Hills site by building an 850-square-foot extension on the roof of an existing streamlined modern house with views of Hollywood. His expansion, containing master bedroom, bathroom and lounge area, conforms with California's Modernist tradition of melding inside and outside. The external walls are more glass than solid, with pivoting wood-frame doors, top left. Translucent blue-green channel glass provides privacy while admitting a diffuse light. This glass is a favorite of the architect, who has been experimenting with uses of glass as a skin. Shadows are provided by a slightly undulating trellis of Douglas fir slats, which follows the graceful curve of the building, above left.

It's hard to find gentle humor in jazz -- thanks, perhaps, to the development of harmony over melody and its attendant dangers of bombast and romanticism -- but the clarinetist Andy Biskin has perfect radar for it. ''Dogmental,'' his first album, is full of short pieces that break down into contrapuntal arrangements and short, pungent solos; it's a sweet-tempered album that doesn't take itself too seriously but has a lot of hidden virtues. There are hints of early Ellington (''Little Elsa,'' which develops a strong melody out of six notes, and ''Field Days,'' with Bruce Eidem's growling trombone solo), polka (''Sad Commentary'') and bits of Steve Lacy at his most ruminative and delicate. It would be so easy for an album like this to collapse under the weight of preciousness, but it doesn't. The rhythm section (Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums) gives it muscle. You can't say it's indicative of what jazz is up to or where it's going, but it's a little triumph nonetheless. BEN RATLIFF",2000-12-22T05:00:00+0000

Merrill, died December 18, 2000 in Atlanta, GA., at the age of 102. Born Hellen Ingram in 1898, Mrs. Plummer was raised in Jacksonville, FL. After graduating from high school, she worked as society editor of a Jacksonville newspaper from 1917 until 1922 when, as publisher and editor, she began her own biweekly paper of social happenings in Jacksonville and Miami. In the mid-1920s, she studied at Columbia University in New York and became an almostadopted daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Conde Nast of publishing fame. She learned to know many of their celebrated friends, including Charlie Chaplin and Katherine Hepburn. In 1925, she married Charles Merrill and, in the following year, gave birth to James. For some years, they lived in South Hampton. Among her house guests from New York's creative community were such notables as George Gershwin, who, during one summer there, wrote the score for ''Babes in Arms.'' Mrs. Plummer's marriage to Mr. Merrill ended in divorce in 1939. Mr. Merrill died in 1955. During World War II, Mrs. Plummer served as an American Red Cross volunteer in the Pacific Theater. Stationed on Guam, she was in charge of receiving and assigning some 1,200 Red Cross girls who passed through her depot. Mrs. Plummer remarried in 1950. Her second husband Brigadier General William L. Plummer and Mr. Merrill, both U.S. Army Air Corps pilots, had flown together in World War I. In World War II, General Plummer was in command of Orly Field in Paris. After the war, he was assigned to accompany Winston Churchill on his tour of the U.S. General Plummer died in 1969. James Merrill's book of poetry ''Nights and Days'' received the 1967 National Book Award. His 1976 Pulitzer Prize was for ''Divine Comedies.'' He died in 1995. Mrs. Plummer was a charter member of the Junior League of Jacksonville. She was a member of the Piedmont Driving Club in Atlanta and the Everglades Club in Palm Beach. Mrs. Plummer is survived by her step-children Doris Merrill Magowan (Mrs. Robert A.) of San Francisco, Charles E. Merrill, Jr., of Boston and Betty Plummer Potts (Mrs. Thomas B.) of Anniston, AL.

The same publisher has reissued Shaw's first novel, The Young Lions ($18), which tells of the wartime experiences of three soldiers -- an Austrian Nazi and two Americans -- and their climactic meeting in a Bavarian forest.

Employees said they had been told that to prevent theft, they should follow black customers around and not give them large shopping bags.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; 'A New Type of Woman',"Wonder Woman, the first popular female comic-book character, was considered so representative of feminism that she appeared on the cover of the first issue of Ms. magazine, but she was really more of a twisted sister. According to Les Daniels's WONDER WOMAN: The Life and Times of the Amazon Princess (Chronicle, $29.95), she was created in 1941-42 by a Harvard-trained psychologist named William Moulton Marston as, in his words, ''psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who should, I believe, rule the world.'' The early comics were rife with intimations of lesbianism, bondage and discipline. The all-female Paradise Island bore more than a passing resemblance to Lesbos, and the superheroine's favorite epithet was ''Suffering Sappho!'' She managed to get herself tied up or bound by exotic methods in virtually every installment. In one choice panel, Wonder Woman hogties an Atlantean giantess while exclaiming, ''On Paradise Island where we play many binding games this is considered the safest method of tying a girl's arms!'' ''Women enjoy submission,'' insisted Marston, who lived in a menage trois. Ninety percent of Wonder Woman's fans may have been male (the Nancy Sinatra boots, spangly shorts and Versace bustier didn't hurt). The text by Daniels, who has also given the same super-treatment to Superman and Batman, is unfortunately not as colorful as its subject matter, but there are some wonderful arcana: a photograph of a very young Debra Winger as Wonder Girl standing next to the Junoesque Lynda Carter from the television series, and one of a Wonder-Woman-shaped scissors.

The warming wine offers a dusky-fruity bouquet, a lovely deep garnet color, a concentrated grapey-raisiny flavor with restrained sweetness, a smooth texture and a high-octane 18.5 percent alcohol level. The wine was made from chambourcin grapes, and was fortified with brandy made at Knapp Vineyards in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Unionville has also released its second ice wine, the '99 Cool Foxy Lady, a sweet white dessert wine in the half-bottle, made wholly from vidal grapes, $17. The grapes, picked ripe, were refrigerated and with t water content nearly solid, were pressed gently, enabling the unfrozen acidity, carrying sugar and flavor, to drip out slowly before fermentation.

''He said, 'You can do that?''' recalls her husband, Thadee Klossowski, a son of the painter Balthus. ''And she said, 'Sure.' Well, that day he had eaten the whole thing.''",2000-12-24T05:00:00+0000

Marc Jacobs has introduced short- and long-sleeve men's T-shirts with big rats printed on them (they cost $150 and $180 and come in eight color combinations) for spring 2001. Mr. Jacobs designed the collection, called Stinky Rat Productions, with his friend the photographer Juergen Teller. It was inspired by Mr. Teller's daughter, 3, when she called her father ''a stinky rat'' in front of Mr. Jacobs. Diesel StyleLab, an experimental division of Diesel, used rat logos in its spring-summer men's collection. They scamper across preppy clothes like an army green polo ($65), a khaki camp shirt ($115) and a pale pink bomber jacket ($325). ''Since we are a laboratory for style, the idea was to do a lab rat,'' said Leo Brankovich, a designer for the line. He pointed out that he was born in 1972, the Year of the Rat on the Chinese calendar. ''I've been amazed by people's reactions,'' he added.

Mr. Yohe graduated from Baldwin High School in 1955 and attended Syracuse University where he majored in fine arts. An advertising executive and animation designer, Mr. Yohe won five EMMYs as a creator, designer and executive producer of ''Schoolhouse Rock'', a series of educational programs broadcast by the ABC Television Network for 25 years. Mr. Yohe's animated characters for films like ''I'm Just a Bill'' and ''Conjunction Junction'' became icons for the young viewers of the '70's now known as Generation X. The ''tiny scrap of paper'' depicted in ''I'm Just a Bill'' and the switchman from ''Conjunction Junction'' became more memorable images to children than most that they encountered in the traditional environment of the classroom. As Generation X has moved on to adulthood, its fascination with the concept and characters of ''Schoolhouse Rock'' has led to numerous books, articles and educational seminars. Mr. Yohe began a career in advertising as an art director at Young & Rubicam. In 1964 he moved to McCaffrey & McCall where he rose to co-creative director. In 1986 Mr. Yohe moved to Grey Advertising where he served in a senior creative position until taken ill in November 2000. Mr. Yohe was married to the former Cynthia Doen in 1960. They had four children: Thomas, James, Lauren and Suzanne. In 1980 Mr. Yohe married his second wife, Diane Sanden Seely. Ms. Seely had two children, Colin and Darren. The couple has resided in Norwalk, CT since their marriage. Mr. Yohe will be remembered as a warm, sensitive, irrepressibly creative man whose cartoon characters were loved by millions and who was a devoted father to an adoring family and beloved by a wide circle of friends. Mr. Yohe is survived by his wife Diane, brother Robert L. Yohe of Bonita Springs, FL, sons Thomas of Brooklyn, NY and James of Munster, Germany, daughter Lauren of Tarrytown, NY, daughter Suzanne Tessitore of Manhattan, step-son Colin Seely of Darien, CT, step-son Darren Seely of Grafton, MA and four grandchildren.

But, Ms. Fishbein said, word spread and within weeks Amazon.com called her, saying it had received many inquiries about the book. She said the book filled a need for a kosher cookbook for everyday use. The book, $26.95, can be still be purchased directly from the school at (973) 597-1115, extension 197, but sales from any source all bring money into the school.

But intermingle they do in this entrancing Taiwanese ''Turn of the Screw.'' In Taipei, ghosts, restless spirits, witches and doppelg<diamond=ngers can turn up anywhere and at any time -- they are as wily as foxes, as evanescent as the steam from a cup of tea. The narrator is a Chinese-American, an amateur collector of strange stories, whose command of Chinese is as untrustworthy as his troublesome pair of contact lenses, which afford him ''only passing moments of lucidity.'' The plot, such as it is, concerns his investigations into the identity of the ''Taxi Driver Killer,'' who has been terrorizing young women in Taipei. Lu depicts the city as a disorienting, labyrinthine world where nothing is quite what it seems. Here the boundary between dreams and reality is blurred, landmarks become evasive and a person's identity, even his very size and shape, is mutable. It is a place where ''secrets were whispered through the clenched, oceanic hiss of mah-jongg tiles.'' Lu's prose, at once eerie and meticulous, nicely captures the cool, abstracted voice of his narrator, who becomes increasingly seduced and manipulated by his own imagination. This devilish puzzle of a novel may frustrate the casual reader, but it will appeal to anyone who loves the cat-and-mouse games of Nabokov, the playful elegance of Borges or the rarefied dreamscapes of Calvino.

He first identified the Ebola outbreak in October, and led the battle against it in Gulu, a city in Uganda's north that has been the center of the epidemic. Dr. Lukwiya, a quiet man in his early 40's who left a wife and five children, died on the battlefield of a successful campaign. Although the infection has sprung up in another district, it is nearly eradicated in Gulu. Dr. Lukwiya's dedication and effectiveness won him admiration in Uganda and among the small band of doctors worldwide concerned with Ebola, and he was widely mourned. His death reminds the world that Africa produces heroism in addition to tragedy, very often both at once.",2000-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Marceca was a real estate investor, developer and property manager. Mr. Marceca was in the real estate business for over 30 years. He developed, owned and managed his own real estate portfolio, both in the U.S. and abroad. During the 1980s he was extremely active in the cooperative/condominium business, having converted over 100 buildings throughout NYC, Westchester and Long Island. In the 1990s Mr. Marceca began buying unsold cooperative shares and condominium units of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments at discounted values and more recently, began acquiring residential rental properties. Mr. Marceca was truly a maverick in defining the undervalued market niche for blocks of unsold shares of cooperative and unsold condominium units. Mr. Marceca maintained relationships with dozens of brokers, banks, financial institutions and private lending investment groups who assisted and participated with him in his many ventures. Robert was born on December 1, 1943 in NYC, the son of Alda Marceca and the late Robert P. Marceca. Mr. Marceca, a devoted family man, is survived by his wife, Nini, daughters Cathy Pilkin, Kobi, Kaylie, Riley and Siena, son, Nico, and grandchildren Kaitlin, Sean and Maggie. His contagious enthusiasm for life, his courage, commitment and leadership will be missed by his friends, colleagues, business associates and employees. Mr. Marceca was also a philanthropist, especially interested in organizations which served children. Mr. Marceca was a devoted member of the Steering Committee for Fight Against Childhood Epilepsy and Seizures (FACES), a charity at Mt. SinaiNYU Medical Center whose mission is to promote improved quality of life for children with epilepsy through clinical care, education, and research. Among Mr. Marceca's many generous contributions to the organization was an apartment for families to use while their child has brain surgery or is monitored at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU. He was the founder of the Siena New Hope Home, which provides a safe haven to support children and aid them to achieve their maximum psychological, social and economic potential while fully respecting the dignity and worth of each individual. The home presently houses five children at a time. Mr. Marceca was also the founder of the Siena Hostel in Eluru, India, which schools 100 very poor children. He also purchased various supplies for the poor including food for hungry children and vehicles in Brazil, India, Ireland, Albania, Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Conrail's 11,400-mile system was divided in June 1999 between CSX and Norfolk Southern. CSX owns 42 percent of Conrail, and Norfolk Southern owns 58 percent. Conrail said it expects a substantial increase in freight traffic along the Perth Amboy line in the next decade.

The decision is a victory for Merrill Lynch, which has not been a major contender for stock underwriting in China, and a blow for Goldman, Sachs, which has. Morgan Stanley, which has built its presence in China through a joint venture with the China Construction Bank, managed the biggest Chinese offering so far, a $5.7 billion sale by the wireless phone operator China Unicom.

His work is purposely fragmented; his intentions are purposely oblique. That this story of four women representing three contemporary generations has a recognizably linear structure, identifiable themes and characters who speak largely in complete, diagrammable sentences -- it's almost Dickensian by Mr. Wellman's standards -- in some ways makes it all the more tantalizing.",2000-12-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Pursuit of the Nut Lady,"With its engrossing story of a small-town murder with big repercussions, G. K. Wuori's first novel, AN AMERICAN OUTRAGE: A Novel of Quillifarkeag, Maine (Algonquin, $22.95), immediately calls to mind ''Twin Peaks.'' But in this case, the victim is more like the town crazy than Laura Palmer. What's more, the local police aren't trying to solve the murder: they committed it. After Ellen DeLay's otherwise loving husband of 26 years accidentally locks her in a large toolbox in the back of his truck for three days, she decides that it's time for a major change. She leaves him, moves into a lonely cabin in the woods and begins dressing game for hunters. Although her business is soon booming, her reputation suffers, and she becomes, in the eyes of the townsfolk, the nutty lady of the woods. When she accidentally shoots off the pinkie of a local man who's on a drinking spree, she ignites the suspicions of the authorities, and four female law enforcement officers descend on Ellen's home, killing her in a panicky hailstorm of bullets. Wilma Doll, one of Ellen's closest friends, witnesses the shooting and determines to settle the score with the official in charge. All this is related by Wilma's father, who gives us context and background and weaves the details of the story into ''a package small enough to be held with horror or embraced with wisdom.'' The appeal of Wuori's offbeat novel is that it shortchanges neither the horror these people visit on one another nor the lessons they learn in order to cope with it.

Born in Montoursville, PA., he received a degree in Business Administration from the University of Pittsburgh, before graduating from Temple Medical School in 1939. He interned at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Erie, PA. He then served as Chief Resident at newly opened Triboro Hospital in New York City, before joining the staff at Lenox Hill in 1943. In 1948, he was appointed to the teaching faculty and was named Chief of Pulmonary Medicine in 1964. He served for many years as Chief of the Nursing Health Service and Chief of the Employee Health Service, which were ultimately combined under his direction. With little interest in hospital politics and business, Dr. Gearhart turned down several high-profile opportunities during his career. He much preferred to lead rounds with residents, to brighten the hospital with his spirit and humor, and to dedicate himself to his patients and practice. He retired in 1988.

Without so much as an anniversary to account for the coincidence (Martin was born in 1890 and died in 1974), New York audiences this season are hearing both. Last month, the Finnish mezzo-soprano Monica Groop joined Robert Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic for the New York premiere of ''Der Cornet.'' Beginning on Thursday, as prelude to the ''German Requiem'' of Brahms, Kurt Masur conducts the first New York Philharmonic performances of the ''Jedermann'' Monologues, with the German bass-baritone Thomas Quast hoff as soloist.",2000-12-31T05:00:00+0000

By year's end, a story in USA Today reported that some critics and industry-watchers were declaring 2000 the worst year for movies since the advent of sound, and there has been widespread pining for the vanished golden age -- 1999, to be precise. Where, wondered critics and moviegoers, was this year's ''American Beauty'' or ''Being John Malkovich''? To make matters worse, several large theater chains, after a period of precipitous expansion, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. A potential actors' strike threatens to bring production of new movies to a halt next spring. Nobody wants to see serious movies; fewer and fewer foreign films make it into American theaters. The big studios are content to make hundreds of millions of dollars on overhyped, mediocre pictures -- ''M:I-2,'' ''Gladiator,'' ''The Grinch'' -- that people see more out of habit and desperation than enthusiasm.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Pictures in Large Type,"Everything in Art Shay's background qualified him to be a member of that slightly off-center species, the news photographer. As he relates in ALBUM FOR AN AGE: Unconventional Words and Pictures From the 20th Century (Ivan R. Dee, $29.95), he came out of the East Bronx, learned how to do a job under pressure while engaged in bombing missions during World War II, and trained in the rough-and-tumble school of Chicago daily newspapers in a time when you were fired if your pictures weren't gorier, funnier or more schmaltzy than those of the always-tough competition. Shay's strength, as with all top-of-the-line photojournalists, is not just in Tri-X film and luck, but with his eye for the incongruous -- the Senate crimebuster Estes Kefauver raising his hands in mock surrender to a small boy brandishing a cap pistol or Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago fondling a harp, his facial expression suggesting he is thinking of it for a grandchild and not a political rival. But Shay also had a sense of the macabre, as shown in his picture of the corpses of two Chicago nurses, victims of the mass murderer Richard Speck, waiting their turn on hospital autopsy tables. And he could capture poignancy, as in an image of a shop window filled with bridal-gowned mannequins, reflecting a very pregnant young woman walking by and an older one reading a newspaper. Shay's running commentary to his half-century of shooting pictures is crisp, erudite and at times hilarious. David Murray",2000-12-31T05:00:00+0000

At 77, the younger Bien is still working, but he has a low opinion of the retro-traditional style: ''It's just a yuppie fad -- there's nothing wrong with white-glazed-brick buildings.''",2000-12-31T05:00:00+0000

us,A Haunting New Opera Amid Happy Returns,"BEST NEW WORK OF THE YEAR -- Nothing is more important to the state of classical music than the introduction of a fine new work. I heard many this year, but the one that keeps coming back to me is Kaija Saariaho's affecting opera ''L'Amour de Loin,'' which was given its premiere in a ravishing production by Peter Sellars at the Salzburg Festival in August. The novelist and poet Amin Maalouf provided the composer with the best libretto written in some time, a mystical tale, loosely based on history, of a 12th-century prince and troubadour who nurtures an idealized love for a beautiful countess from Tripoli of whom he has only heard. The work is not flawless. Ms. Saariaho misses the understated humor in Mr. Maalouf's text.

''It's not that Champagne has a specific property that nourishes the skin,'' Ms. Ferrara said. ''But it leaves it feeling tingly and perky.'' By mid-January, the spa will also offer a Champagne bubble bath ($75), a 30-minute soak in a tub of Champagne and warm water. In keeping with the spirit of New Year's, Ms. Ferrara has also developed a facial ($95) using tiny black beluga esque jojoba beads, filled with moisturizing oils and caviar extract that are meant to moisturize dry skin. After the hourlong treatment, a vodka-based cleanser is used as an astringent. For those who have no other plans to ring in 2001, spa appointments are available at midnight tonight.

Ann is survived by daughter Christie Soffel of Washington, DC, and brother Neill Hunter Payne of Fouke, Arkansas. Ann was born May 24, 1934, in New York City. She spent her early years in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and remained until the mid '70's. Ann graduated from Mount Mercy Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended the Traphagen School of Design in New York City. Ann divided her time between Sarasota, Florida, and Wainscott, NY. She left Pittsburgh in the mid '70's and relocated to New York City for several years. During her Pittsburgh years Ann worked as a fashion model. Ann also implemented one of Pittsburgh's first drug abuse prevention programs through HUD's Office of Economic Opportunity, working with inner city youth in drug prevention and self-care. Mrs. Edson was a member of Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh. Known for her outstanding abilities to entertain friends and family in her home, Ann decided while in New York City to turn her talents into a profession and became a well known caterer in New York City and Long Island's Hamptons. Throughout her life, Ann supported the arts. In Sarasota she was an active volunteer for the Florida West Coast Symphony Association for several years. Ann was a recognized artist herself. Most of her painting took place at the Victor D'Amico Institute of Art in Amagansett, NY. Ann painted and worked in several art mediums, including acrylic, watercolor, charcoal, batik and collage. Displays of her artwork can be seen at the Victor D'Amico Institute of Art (summers only) and also at the Payne Mansion in Sarasota, Florida-a home built by her grandfather Christy Payne in 1934, which is now a museum for the Marie Selby Gardens. Ann was also a firm supporter of the conservation and research efforts of Selby Gardens, which is also known worldwide as a major source of reference for tropical plants, in particular orchids and bromeliads. Ann actively volunteered at Selby Gardens, assisting with the many social and cultural events held at the Gardens each year. The Payne Mansion is used for receptions and special events and is often featured as Selby's Holiday House and Designer Showcase. A foundation in memory of Ann Payne Edson to support both the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota, Florida, and the Victor D'Amico Institute of Art in Amagansett, NY, is in the works.

us,Schubert's Poets,"Considering that Schubert wrote more than 600 songs in his truncated life, many at top speed, he did remarkably well at choosing poems to set. In addition to prolific variations on standard themes of love, God and death, his music immortalized verses about fish, flowers, streams, pigeons, colors, sad journeys and famously, his own love for music itself. Next Sunday afternoon in Princeton, the German baritone Matthias Goerne is to sing a recital of Schubert songs grouped by poet instead of cycle or theme. Instead of often-heard settings of Goethe and Rellstab, the poets on the program at McCarter Theater are Schiller and four others far less known today. Mr. Goerne, a pupil of the renowned baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, is not much older than Schubert was when he died at the age of 31. Staying within the bounds of the non-cutting-edge German repertory, Mr. Goerne successfully chooses to delve rather than span. The pianist for this recital is Eric Schneider.

Only a near-pubescent girl could distinguish the Backstreet Boys from 'N Sync, 98 Degrees, O-Town or the parody band 2gether. In 2000, the appearance of innocence was no longer the only selling point for teenypop; looking for longevity, Britney Spears started to bump and grind and 'N Sync sang about cybersex. Meanwhile, top-secret music-business laboratories, or their parental and management equivalents, also brewed girl groups, teenage country singers, even a teenage classical soprano.
