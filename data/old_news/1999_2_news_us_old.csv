He attended the Collegiate School in New York, class of '28, the Phillips Exeter Academy, class of '28 and graduated from Harvard, class of '31. After several years of working on Wall Street, he entered the Air Force in April 1942, serving first with the 104th Anti-Submarine Squadron based in Atlantic City and then serving overseas with the 498th Bombardment Group on Saipan, receiving an honorable discharge in September 1945. For several years after the war he was active with various charitable organizations, namely the Jewish Board of Guardians, where he served on various committees, including chairman of the Farm and Parole Committees of the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School, the Jewish Big Brothers and helping in the formation of the Big Brothers of America; and member of the Girls Service League, of which his mother had been one of the founders. In 1955, he joined Ralph Destino in the formation of the Destino jewelry firm. After Ralph's death, he took over management of the company, obtaining from the company the license to manufacture and sale Christian Dior men's jewelry and accessories for North America. He sold the firm to Benrus in 1971, staying on another 5 years as consultant. After the sale in 1971, he retired from most activities but designed a house in Acapulco, Mexico for his adopted son Rheal Boulanger Glazier, where they both spent most of the winter. He also gave much of his Chappaqua property to the town for the Glazier Arboretum. Between 1988 and 1990 he sold all his property except for the city house, where he lived permanently. After his son's death in 1991, he also sold the city house and purchased and remodeled an apartment in the Lombardy Hotel, where he spent the rest of his life. His closest surviving relative is his niece Rena Bransten of San Francisco and, of course, her children and grandchildren.

What makes these images so especially puzzling and delicious? What do reflected images tell us about perception itself? With typical charm and erudition, Jonathan Miller's ON REFLECTION (National Gallery/Yale University, $40) offers a breezy, lively tour through art history, optics and cognitive psychology. Miller, a director and commentator on the arts, uses computer graphics to contrast the famous convex mirror at the back of Jan van Eyck's ''Arnolfini Portrait'' with the equally famous flat one in ''Las Meninas'' by Velazquez. He analyzes Henri Cartier-Bresson's famous photograph of a man running across a big puddle by way of a quick digression on the Italian psychologist Gaetano Kanisza. He also considers more whimsical topics, like the moment when Alice steps through the looking glass. ''What the author conveniently forgets to mention,'' Miller writes, ''is the perplexing and indeed indescribable shemozzle'' -- slang for brawl or muddle -- ''that would have occurred when Alice met herself coming in the opposite direction.''

Even the coincidental presence in the audience of an incensed Harold Pinter, fiercely hissing ''Shut up! Shut up!'' in the dark, didn't put an end to it.

''But that's not how it is. Chunks of ice brace up against each other, forming barriers to easy passage.'' He could well be describing these 11 stories and the narrative thread that runs through them. Full of numbed characters with razor-sharp edges, Cheuse's solidly constructed book eventually delivers the reader to a satisfyingly complicated finale. In the very first story, ''The Mexican Maid,'' an emotionally cauterized fellow named Birnhaus drinks to dull the pain of his divorce. When Birnhaus discovers his housekeeper dead in his living room, his emotions snap briefly back to attention: Once again, he has lost the woman who kept his home in order. Death also figures in a subsequent story, ''Man in a Barrel,'' when Jackson, an angry, recently divorced husband on an awkward afternoon outing with his three sons, is horrified when someone tosses an infant over the railing at Niagara Falls. But it's not just the men who seem frozen into uncomfortable positions as observers of their own and others' torment; Cheuse's female protagonists can lead equally difficult lives. In ''An Afternoon of Harp Music in Lake Charles, Louisiana,'' a divorced businesswoman named Louise broods about reuniting with her sister ''after a five-year hiatus, to meet her new husband, to see how life might have turned out for her if Alex hadn't left. A house, a job that kept you in one place, quiet long hours together.'' In the final story, ''On the Millstone River: A Story From Memory,'' Cheuse conjures up yet another account of broken relationships, distant children, seemingly endless travels. But while the earlier stories are as frigid as the terrain he covers, this one, a richly detailed conclusion to the collection, produces an unexpectedly gratifying thaw.

He knew Michael a bit, he volunteered, because he was a Carolina guy, and had played ball there a very long time ago. Perhaps he could help with the access. That did not strike me as likely.

Instead, he looked quite ordinary, just another man in his 60's, a little shorter than me, perhaps 5 feet 9 inches or 5-10. His name, he said, was Tommy Kearns, and for a long time the name meant nothing to me; during most of the ensuing three or four months of our regular conversations I did not think of him by his name, but rather as the pleasant, helpful Carolina alumnus from the gym, a man who was, judging by the sweat on his workout clothes and the slightly chunky outline of his body, working even harder than I to keep his weight down. In the modern age when a player is usually at least 6-5, and with a body fat content of under 7 percent, he did not look like a player; that was emphasized by the fact that the New York Liberty players practice at our gym and from time to time as we talked we would look at the sleek, powerful bodies of young female professionals, all of them, it seemed, stronger and taller than we were.",1999-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"What Did You Do in the War, Mama?","By 3 in the afternoon of Jan. 12, 1981, the village of El Limon had been burned to the ground. That morning, soldiers of El Salvador's National Guard had entered the village, 50 mud houses in the jungle on the side of a mountain, an hour's walk up a rutted dirt-and-stone road from the nearest town. They burned the houses, shot the adults and set one old woman on fire. El Limon is in the province of Morazan, one of two where the Marxist guerrillas were strongest. Two days before, the guerrillas had begun a nationwide offensive, and the military reacted with aerial and ground attacks on villages like El Limon, even though El Limon had no combatants. The military, as the United Nations-sponsored Commission on the Truth in El Salvador concluded 12 years later, was engaged in ''a deliberate strategy of eliminating or terrifying the peasant population in areas where the guerrillas were active. . . . [T]he deliberate, systematic and indiscriminate violence against the peasant population in areas of military operations went on for years.''",1999-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Portable Pups,"With their sausage-shaped torsos, squat legs and stubborn personalities, dachshunds might seem an inelegant choice for a lap dog, but the compact hounds are the in-breed among downtown artists and uptown socialites. Both types like them because they are portable but not prissy. ''They are a real dog in a small size,'' said Sloan Lindemann, a co-host of ''Woman's Day TV'' on the PAX network. ''Mine goes on airplanes all the time, but doesn't need a hairdresser. A Maltese needs Frederic Fekkai.'' Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, author of ''Dog People'' (Artisan, 1995), a book of portraits, said they were the hot breed in art circles because Picasso and Andy Warhol owned them. ''Plus, dachshunds are ugly,'' he said. ''They're a natural for artists.'' The Dachshund Friendship Club in New York started with 30 members in 1993 and now has 1,000. Status depends on color, size and fur type. In Paris, the rabbit-size variety, Kaninchen (German for rabbit), are prestigious. Blond wire-haired dachshunds, like Posy (above, left), are also rare, and are $1,500 to $3,000.

us,Up From Underground,"Just over three years ago, Paterson designated a lot at Bridge Street and Broadway as a municipal historic site. The plaque there says it was once the Huntoon-Van Rensalier Station of the Underground Railroad. It is named for Josiah P. Huntoon, an industrialist, and William Van Rensalier, his black engineer, who lived with the Huntoon family and helped shelter runaway slaves in their home there. The lot has been vacant since the city razed the building in 1983 to make way for a parking lot. In 1995, Taco Bell proposed putting an outlet on the lot but withdrew its plans after community opposition. Now, the book ''Bridge Street to Freedom: Landmarking a Station on the Underground Railroad'' tells two linked tales: that of the Underground Railroad stop, through Dolores Van Rensalier's research about her great-grandfather, and that of the late 20th-century struggle to protect the legacy of the site, through an essay by Flavia Alaya, a professor of social science at Ramapo college. It also contains historical footnotes and newspaper clippings supporting both stories.

She was a feisty and independent 84 years old. Born in Chicago, IL, the only child of Louis and Frieda Freiman, she followed in her father's footsteps and started acting in the Yiddish theater while still in her teens. Her career in and commitment to the theater were centerpieces of her life. While she began her dramatic work in the Yiddish Theater, she had her own Yiddish radio show in the 1940s and continued to act in off Broadway productions, movies and television commercials until she was 80 years old. She was an active member of the Hebrew Actors Union. In 1947 Flora married Murray Roth, who died in 1970. They had two children: David Roth, a world-class coin magician, and Lisa Roth, a graphic artist and social activist. Flora overcame adversity with a smile, a spectacular sense of humor and undaunted optimism. Her personal philosophy was ''life is wonderful''-but she said it in Yiddish. She possessed a joy for living and a gift for laughter. She loved people, and everyone loved her back. She leaves behind her two children; her nephews, nieces, grand nephews and grand nieces; her 99-year-old Uncle Sol and his wife Elizabeth; and a vast collection of friends, neighbors, healthcare providers and acquaintances who all loved her. The passing of our wonderful mother leaves a tremendous void in our lives-we miss her already. A private celebration of Flora's life will be held in the spring.

As the traditional notion of reality fractures, and it becomes possible to imagine living in a culture that is largely illusion, the museum might be a bulwark against the loss of both past and present, or so says Hans-Peter Schwarz, director of the Z.K.M./Center for Art and Media here. In a book called ''Media/Art/History'' (Prestel), he writes: ''A museum must always remain that impressive place where one can assure oneself of one's own reality and of the material reality of the historical and artistic evidence of history. It is perhaps the museum that can provide one of the last refuges for the sensual scrutiny of reality, particularly in this age of total simulations.''",1999-02-14T05:00:00+0000

Ms. Barrett resembles her creator, Jane Isenberg, in a number of ways.

''Much of the world's best and most important work gets done by mid-life women who seat and forget in stoic silence,'' Ms. Isenberg wrote in a statement about the book, explaining why she created her protagonist. In the novel, the president of River Edge Community College is killed, and to uncover the murderer, Bel Barrett maneuvers through a familiar Hudson County landscape of multi-ethnicity and political corruption.

Great beribboned baskets of them, delivered in horse-drawn vans by a coachman and attendant in livery. They would have been banked in tall, cut-glass vases about her bed.'' To the over-vivid Violet, who developed a scandalous, lifelong passion for Vita Sackville-West before she was 14, her mother ''resembled a Christmas tree laden with presents for everyone.'' But to Bertie, a great warthog of a man, beringed, cigar-puffing and enormously fat, who happened to be King Edward VII, their mother was his ''favorita,'' his ''Little Mrs. George,'' whose ''alabaster skin, blue eyes, chestnut hair, large breasts, kindness and charm'' drove him to such flights of admiration that he secured a high-paying job for her husband, magicked her an investment portfolio worth tens of thousands of pounds, dressed her in gowns by Worth, diamond collars and ropes of pearls and invited her to Ascot, Sandringham and Biarritz. Throughout their very public affair, which lasted until Bertie's death, Mrs. Keppel preserved her marriage, her respectability in society and her charms. Her unluckier daughter and great-granddaughter have been tarred by amour's sloppy brush; but Mrs. Keppel, as her biographer Diana Souhami has written, ''turned adultery into an art.''",1999-02-14T05:00:00+0000

The all-natural cleansers are the work of Leslie Sheehan, who ran a factory before deciding she'd rather make scents out of soap. Although selecting a soap isn't supposed to be a life-or-death struggle, you never know, so Patrick Rafferty, the hotel manager, limits the front-desk options to two, unless Sheehan is testing something new like Michael's Ocean (middle). Men on their own usually go for Lemongrass; men traveling with women usually go to their mates for a decision; women, traveling alone or not, usually go for Jumble. And some don't know where to go.

us,A Lenya Celebration,"Though she had a voice as distinctive as Piaf's, Mabel Mercer's or Billie Holiday's, Lotte Lenya's husky vibrato -- like her face -- was not always pretty. However, it was consistently warm, honest and expressive, and her singing immortalized the music of her first husband, Kurt Weill. LENYA, THE LEGEND: A Pictorial Autobiography (Overlook, $45), a combination scrapbook and memoir, has been assembled by David Farneth to celebrate Lenya's 100th birthday. It is lavishly illustrated with photographs from her shows, program and album covers, caricatures and publicity shots; the text has been culled from letters, journals, interviews and Lenya's unfinished autobiography. As she discusses her life and times, Lenya proves to be a canny and humorous observer. Following Weill's death in 1950, she declared that the ''task of my life'' was to make his music better known in the United States, a task that she soon began to fulfill in a legendary long-running production of ''The Threepenny Opera.'' As evidenced here, Lenya became a ferocious guardian of Weill's legacy until her own death in 1981. In her own words, Lenya comes across as an extremely shrewd if loving person. Whether singing or writing, she had a strong and appealing voice, and it is easy to see why Tennessee Williams began each morning listening to her. David Kaufman",1999-02-14T05:00:00+0000

Sometimes you see a caring, open-minded doctor, but that's only so he can spar with the uncaring, close-minded kind. Still, the greatest conflict in television relationships is reserved for the two bitterest adversaries, also known as the husband and wife. Conflicts between couples drive such hits as ABC's ''Home Improvement,'' CBS's ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and NBC's ''Will and Grace,'' although technically Will and Grace are roommates, not a couple. In these shows, loved ones routinely conceal information from each other, occasionally lie to each other and, worst of all, make plans without checking with each other. But no matter how much one partner ruins the dinner (the career opportunity, the fine porcelain pig), all misunderstandings are resolved by the end of the show, when the offender gets his or her comeuppance, followed by a hug. ''Jill's lucky to be fiction,'' said Patricia Richardson about her ''Home Improvement'' character. ''In the show, I have to let go of my anger and suspicion way earlier than I would in real life.''

us,Blood on the Moon (Really!),"Certain English critics have decided that Philip Kerr is ''Michael Crichton's smarter brother,'' a gibe that's unfair to both these techno-thrillerists. After all, Kerr never aims for Crichton's bullet-train narrative propulsion, and Crichton doesn't chase after Kerr's cosmological great whales. Kerr's new novel, THE SECOND ANGEL (Marian Wood/Holt, $25), tackles nothing less than the nature of God and the ultimate purpose of life in an intermittently tense tale set in 2069, the centennial of the year human footprints first appeared on the moon. As in one of his earlier novels, ''A Philosophical Investigation,'' Kerr invents a credibly grim scenario for our future: most of the earth's inhabitants are infected with a deadly virus and maunder in fetid cities. In contrast, the healthy, wealthy few are cosseted in secure enclaves, rocketing off to the moon to enjoy its sex hotels and clear skies. But the story's central characters -- outlaws, both healthy and infected -- sneak there to rob a vast blood bank, since clean blood is more valuable than gold. Kerr's description of the heist is competently cinematic, but he's more interested in the thematic underpinnings of his plot, projecting 20th-century scientific theories into what turns out to be a surprisingly optimistic vision of human possibility. Embracing the wonder and terror of existence by exploring the intricacies of quantum physics, gene theory and computer technology, this sly and serious writer achieves his most intellectually satisfying novel yet.

Renner (1878-1956), a type designer and teacher at the Munich Meisterschule fur Deutschlands Buchdrucker (Master School for Germany's Printers), designed Futura as an alternative to the traditional German black letter, which had been Germany's national lettering style since Gutenberg. PAUL RENNER: The Art of Typography (Princeton Architectural Press, paper, $35), by Christopher Burke, a typographer and design teacher at the University of Reading in England, provides a fascinating portrait of a man of taste, passion and commitment whose contribution to reading and printing made him an enemy of his state: owing to his criticism of black letter, which the Nazis briefly celebrated as the type of the German people, Renner was persecuted. A short time later, black letter was deemed to be Judenlettern (Jewish type) and serif and sans-serif romans were adopted; still Renner was prohibited from practicing his art and craft.

Upon the release of the state's report on the law's implementation, one doctor who oversaw a suicide described it as a ''very positive, joyful experience'' for the patient and family gathered around. But the state's leading Catholic archbishop said the measure was continuing cause for ''sadness and shame.'' SAM HOWE VERHOVEK",1999-02-21T05:00:00+0000

With a heated mix of religion, desire, desperation and hope, ESPERANZA'S BOX OF SAINTS (Scribner, paper, $12), by Maria Amparo Escandon, tells of this young widow's search for her 12-year-old daughter, Blanca. Esperanza is certain that Blanca has been kidnapped and sold into prostitution, even though the hospital where she underwent a tonsillectomy says she suddenly died. After all, San Judas Tadeo, patron saint of the road and desperate cases, appeared before Esperanza on the grime of her oven window to say, ''Your daughter is not dead.'' After a stint at a Tijuana brothel leads nowhere, she plots her next move, noticing Santa Barbara, San Clemente, San Francisco and San Diego on a map and deciding, ''My saints are waiting for me in California.'' Esperanza has suitably grimy experiences on this slyly humorous magic realism tour, but armed with her box of saint statuettes she never completely loses faith and learns to adjust her ideas about sin. The novel, the author's first, has been made into a Spanish-language film by Alejandro Springall and was screened at this year's Sundance Film Festival. ''God can really do it all single-handedly, but He's the boss; He can afford to have as many assistants as He wants,'' Esperanza believes about her beloved saints. ''Sometimes saints made people go through hell so they could appreciate heaven.'' In her case, at least, miracles do happen. ANDREA HIGBIE",1999-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Cher Hair on Tour,"The long, straight, center-parted hair seen plastered on models and on celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston has propelled bouncy-tressed women into salons, requesting ''Cher Hair.'' The reinvented Cher hairdo is no longer the wash-and-wear look of the 1970's. ''It's so worked and styled, it's unnaturally natural,'' John Frieda, the Manhattan stylist, said. ''It's almost surreal.'' Mr. Frieda, for years the hair world's ultimate straight man, whose team has unkinked the locks of Nicole Kidman, has calibrated the look to the last dead cell. Try this at home. Science kit: A powerful hair dryer -- the thicker your hair, the more power you need (if it burns your hand, it's too hot). A straightening iron (Conair or Babyliss will do). A large, round, densely packed hairbrush with boar's bristles that taper to a point. The chemicals: 1. On wet hair, a silicone product that lays the cuticle flat (KMS Flat Out, or Frieda's own Frizz-Ease Hair Serum). 2. When nearly dry, a styling cream to cut down fuzziness (Frederic Fekkai's Smooth Hair, Kiehl's Shine 'N Light). 3. After ironing, a wax-base balmer (Kim Lepine's Modular Hair Care Finisher 9, Aveda's Brilliant Spray-On or Frieda's Shaping and Glossing Balm). The result: A glossy, flat, almost frozen sheet of hair, so austere it highlights all flaws from roots to crow's feet. If you've something to hide, it's not you, babe.

He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.'' The funeral will be Tuesday, February 23, at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland, Minneapolis. Visitation is Monday, February 22, at the church.

At the time, members of the Kunqu Society of New York made no secret of their objections to the unseen staging, which, as conceived for the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company by Chen Shi-Zheng, a New York director, was to draw on aspects of Chinese opera tradition now lost as well inject touches of naturalism into a medium that has become rigidly stylized.",1999-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FYBISH, PEGGY ROMANO","FYBISH-Peggy Romano. On January 26, 1999, at her Manhattan home. Dearly loved wife and companion since 1971 of Stephen Fybish. Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.",1999-02-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  CARLSON, CURTIS L.","CARLSON-Curtis L. Minnesota entrepreneur. Founder of Carlson Companies. Mr. Carlson died Friday, February 19, after suffering a stroke on February 10. He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year Award from the City of Minneapolis; and numerous awards from the hospitality, travel and marketing industries. He was active in the Masons (33 degree) and Shriners, and Sigma Phi Epsilon national fraternity, from which he received the Order of the Golden Heart. Survivors include his beloved wife of sixty years, Arleen; daughter Marilyn Carlson Nelson and husband Dr. Glen Nelson, and daughter Barbara Carlson Gage and husband Edwin ''Skip'' Gage; grandchildren Diana Nelson and husband Marius Muresanu, Curtis Nelson and wife Margie, Wendy Nelson, Daisy Mitchell, Geoffrey Gage and wife Kelly, Scott Gage and wife Gina, Christine Gage, and Richard Gage and wife Britt; six great-grandchildren; brother Warren and wife Jane; sisters-in-law Elaine Carlson and Hazel Carlson; and numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson was preceded in death by brothers Ken and Dean; a sister, Aileen Miller; and granddaughter, Juliet Nelson. Mr. Carlson will be remembered not only for the professional successes he achieved, but also for his love of family and community, and the integrity he demonstrated in everything he did. He lived a full, wonderful life and was an inspiration to his family, friends and colleagues. His sense of humor, guidance and wisdom will be missed. His immediate family, his extended family, and his corporate family around the world have pledged to follow his advice: ''Do not what I did, but seek what I sought.'' The funeral will be Tuesday, February 23, at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, 511 Groveland, Minneapolis. Visitation is Monday, February 22, at the church. Contributions in his memory may be made to the University of Minnesota, Curtis L. Carlson School of Management and/or Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church.

But the ruling could delay a settlement. Columbia also said that its profit from operations had risen to $27 million, or 4 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1998, rather than the 23 cents a share that analysts had expected, and that it would repurchase up to $1 billion of its stock.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  RICHMAN, BERNARD","RICHMAN-Bernard. Prominent leader in the textile industry, known as the ''King of Fine Cottons'', died on February 21 at Mount Sinai Hospital. The cause was gastric cancer. Born on June 18, 1918 in NYC and raised in Brooklyn, is a direct descendant of Rabbi David of Lelov, founder of the Lelov Chasidic dynasty in Poland, which relocated to Israel after the Holocaust. He began his career after serving his country in W.W. II. He founded Threadtex Inc. in 1964, which became a world renowned supplier of fine fabrics to the men's and women's apparel industry and promoter of Sea Island style cotton. The creative talents he fostered were cherished by designers throughout the industry. His motto was ''Kill them with quality''; his achievements in the textile industry spanned half a century. He touched many lives as a humanitarian and philanthropist. He was a founding and charter member of the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation since its inception in 1989. This foundation was established to ease the burden of FBI families whose loved ones were killed, disabled or became extremely ill while performing their duties. Acting in concert with former FBI assistant director Jim Fox he was responsible for creating an organization which forged a very productive and unique alliance between the NY business community and the Federal law enforcement environment. He was dedicated, loyal and responsible; he exemplified the FBI credo of fidelity, bravery and integrity. As a former member of the Board of Trustees for Park East Synagogue, he supported many Jewish causes. This patriarch will be remembered as a truly elegant gentleman who emanated warmth and wisdom and touched people in all walks of life. His colorful personality will be missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. He is survived by his devoted wife Sheila; daughter Hope Halpert; sons Kenneth and Scott from a previous marriage; four grandchildren; and sister Helen Goldstein. We love you and will carry on your legacy. Tributes to Park East Synagogue, 164 East 68th Street, NYC, or Yad Avrham, 13 East 63rd Street, NYC.",1999-02-24T05:00:00+0000

The old Center of Science and Industry, or Cosi as it is called, has been a popular family destination in Columbus for 35 years. Grown-ups recall visiting its home in the Veteran's Memorial Hall to see a gigantic pendulum and a re-creation of a street in 1880 and for a walking tour of the human heart. The new Cosi, situated in the heart of downtown along the Scioto River, will offer much higher production values when it opens in November: children will be the pendulum in a section called Gadgets. Science, it seems, has become as lively as a tour of Universal Studios, with visits to a shipwreck and an Indiana Jones-style observatory. The exhibits will be housed in a simple but majestic 960-foot ellipse of precast concrete that Mr. Isozaki has described as looking a bit like a submarine. With entrances on both its western and eastern facades, the new building, the architect said, is meant to capture the spirit of a Midwest that casts its glance back eastward to tradition and westward toward ''innovation, hope and the future.''",1999-02-25T05:00:00+0000

Its songs moved from ironic revisions of girl-group rock to urgent punk-rock to trim New Wave pop to disco, reggae and early rap. Deborah Harry, Blondie's singer and main lyricist, tucked an adult attitude between the pop hooks. She understood what it was to desire and be desired, and she knew when to keep her cool and whether to lose it.

us,The Works of a Couple of Modern-Day Itinerant Painters Are Old Before Their Time,"For the price of room and board, itinerant painters of the 19th century were game to put a brush to just about anything, be it signs, murals, portraits, walls or decorations for a staircase. Today, the work of these naive artists is increasingly rare and costly. David Wiggins and Kevin Paulsen have revived the tradition with their own paintings, which look almost exactly like the dreamy, childlike landscapes recorded by such artists as Rufus Porter and Moses Eaton. After starting out as restorers with a knack for the work of itinerant artists, Mr. Wiggins and Mr. Paulsen began to make their own versions, which were painted on plaster layered over lightweight polystyrene and mounted in black shadow frames. Even the impression of age and rough handling has been recreated. ''We've seen the damage and the patina that time has wrought on these works,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''and we try to do that, too.'' Working with the same themes as the originals -- New England townscapes, ports of call and views along river banks -- these nouveau itinerants add their own thematic twists, as in ''Pierot Hunts by Moonlight'' (33 1/2 by 25 1/2 inches, $3,400, below left) or the hallucinatory ''View of Orford, Vermont'' (34 by 47 inches, $4,200, below, right). These sham 19th-century paintings, which weigh little more than the frame, are available at the Manhattan antiques dealer Woodard & Greenstein, 506 East 74th Street; (212) 988-2906.

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION; Profitably Occupied,"Philippe Tapon's second novel, THE MISTRESS (William Abrahams/Dutton, $23.95), is full of life's guiltier pleasures -- terribly rich food, petty luxuries, illicit romance -- but the book itself is the guiltiest pleasure of all, because although it is rife with raw evil, it is altogether enjoyable. Emile Bastien lives with his mistress in Nazi-occupied Paris while his wife subsists in convenient exile in southern France, where she is stranded with neither car nor money. Emile's reputation as one of the city's best gastroenterologists means locals and Nazis alike clamor for his services, whatever the cost. As a result, Emile endures the lean war years very comfortably, until everything -- his affair, his family, his practice and the Nazi occupation -- begins to unravel. Tapon adroitly uses a small cast of characters to render the duplicities and tenuous allegiances of wartime France on an uncomfortably intimate scale. Though the plot twists and slithers almost to the level of soap opera, Tapon evokes strong emotions without resorting to tanks or bombs, mining instead the tangled domesticity of his characters' lives. Curiously, the mistress of the title comes off as vaguely underdrawn, but it may be because she's surrounded by so much that's overpowering. ''Gut-wrenching,'' for example, has never described a scene so well as it does a Nazi's gurgling death by the most exquisitely French means. Reading ''The Mistress'' may feel like a guilty pleasure, but Tapon has nothing to be ashamed of: it's a fine, wicked book. Liam Callanan",1999-02-28T05:00:00+0000

He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year",1999-02-28T05:00:00+0000

us,A Curse on the House,"Republicans in the House of Representatives are looking to their new Speaker, Dennis Hastert, with a yearning that appears suspiciously like desperation. Few of them even pretend that they consider Hastert a forceful leader. As one leadership aide put it recently, and bluntly, ''What people like about Denny is that he's not going to do something stupid.'' Hastert is a modest, amiable soul who is fond of recalling his past career as a high-school wrestling coach. When party leaders came to Hastert in December to tell him that he needed to fill the breach created by the stunningly unexpected resignation of Robert Livingston, the Speaker-designate, Hastert, according to one Midwestern Congressman, ''wasn't sure he could do it, he wasn't sure he wanted to do it, and he was scared.'' What Hastert's colleagues are hoping is that the new Speaker will somehow save them from themselves, as if his bulky frame were a rampart standing between the G.O.P. and the cliff it seems disposed to race off. Hastert's real virtue is that he is not his predecessor, Newt Gingrich, for the retrospective view inside the party is that Gingrich is at the heart of practically everything that anyone thinks went wrong in the last few years. Talk to Republican House members, as I spent the past few weeks doing, and you'll hear that Gingrich was too obsessed with destroying the President, failed to remind the public of the party's accomplishments, caved to the Christian right and caved to the Clinton left. You would think that Gingrich was a virus alien to the party, rather than the party's leader and visionary for most of the decade.",1999-02-28T05:00:00+0000

He relates how his ideological shift from left to right turned lively friendships -- with Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer, among others -- into bitter relics. And when I thought of Sid and Hitch, as their friends (and I'm one) call them, possibly falling into that same politicized sand trap, it was hard not to feel a little sad.

us,"BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION; Polio, and Good Riddance","The polio epidemic of the first half of the 20th century is largely forgotten. Even today, one out of five American children is behind on immunizations by the age of 2, Nina Gilden Seavey, Jane S. Smith and Paul Wagner write in their sweeping history of polio, A PARALYZING FEAR: The Triumph Over Polio in America (TV Books, $29.95). Drawing on the recollections of survivors, physicians and scientists, the authors alternate historical analysis with personal testimonies to re-create the disease cycle, from epidemic to cure. Punctuated by haunting photographs of hospital wards and medical laboratories, the result is a series of fascinating and sobering stories: how polio changed Franklin Delano Roosevelt and how he changed the country's attitude toward polio; how the March of Dimes mobilized average citizens to finance care for tens of thousands of patients; how movie stars and politicians got involved in the effort; and how scientists raced for control of the disease. The most gripping stories are those of the survivors; in their own words, they discuss growing up in metal leg braces and iron lungs, facing the disease day after day. While the authors celebrate America's triumph over polio, they do not sidestep the flaws in human nature that the epidemic brought out: neighbor blaming neighbor, hospitals refusing patients for fear of contagion, and treatment that was at best ''separate but sometimes equal'' for black patients in the South.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FYBISH, PEGGY ROMANO","FYBISH-Peggy Romano. On January 26, 1999, at her Manhattan home. Dearly loved wife and companion since 1971 of Stephen Fybish. Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.",1999-02-28T05:00:00+0000

Books about cities, he told the friend who first urged him to write one on Cairo, ''were of two kinds.

Mattone was a former member of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors of the Bear Stearns Corporation. Mr. Mattone started at Bear Stearns in July of 1979 as a Limited Partner. He was made a General Partner in 1981 and was responsible for Bear Stearns Fixed Income, Financing, Trading and Sales. He was a General Partner and became a member of the Executive Committee before Bear Stearns went public in 1985. His tenure at Bear Stearns accredited him with the design and implementation of the Fixed Income Trading and Finance Systems that were instrumental to the growth of Bear Stearns business. In addition to the design of these systems, Mr. Mattone was co-head of all trading, sales and financings. While at Bear Stearns, Mr. Mattone completed one of the largest clearing transactions in firm's history. Simultaneously he brought in the State of Ohio's 25 billion-dollar pension and investment portfolios as clearing and lending agent. He resigned in 1995 as a member of the Executive Committee and Director of the Public Corporation to pursue his own interests. Prior to joining Bear Stearns, Mr. Mattone was at Salomon Brothers from August of 1964 to March of 1979. Mr. Mattone started as a clerk in the Government Operations Department at Salomon Brothers. He worked many different jobs over his years in the operations area and ultimately became a manager in charge of Government Operations. He implemented financing techniques and systems that allowed the firm to grow with minimal expansion of personnel. Mr. Mattone was on the Federal Reserve Book Entry Conversion Team. In addition, he worked on the development of the Depository Trust Company and the Midwest Clearing Corporation. In 1973, Mr. Mattone was asked to look into the problems arising on the trading floor of Salomon Brothers to determine how to eliminate the error ratio and the redundancies that were costing the firm millions of dollars. Mr. Mattone built and designed a trade and finance system to manage the firm's business. That system led to Mr. Mattone's promotion to Vice President in charge of the firm's financing. Mr. Mattone started the matched book business for Salomon Brothers and was instrumental in creating funding opportunities with tax advantages for both its partners and customers. Mr. Mattone created a term funding market with financing trades being done as long as 20 years. These trades were the nucleus of many arbitrageurs in the business and were used for the foundation of the Salomon Brothers arbitrage trading business. His dedication and commitment to his wife and children were the reasons for working as hard as he did. He survived three heart attacks and went back to work immediately to continue to provide for his family. His dedication to his family was first and foremost. He was a communicant and generous benefactor at Holy Cross RC Church, Rumson. He also served on the Finance and Planning Committee for the church. He was a significant participant for the Path to Peace Foundation; a member of the Knights of the Order of St. Gregory; a significant participant for the Rainbow Foundation; a supporter of the Middletown PBA; a founding father along with State Senator Kyrillos of the Volunteers and Health Organization at Riverview Medical Center, Red Bank; and he established a scholarship at Monmouth University in memory of his late wife, Emilia who pre-deceased him in September, 1997. He was pre-deceased by his wife, Emilia and his parents, Sebastian and Ann nee Maiorino in 1996. He is survived by his sons, Vincent J., Jr & Alan J. both of Locust, NJ; his daughter and son-in-law, Michele and Peter L. Corvisiero of Middletown, NJ and one grandson, Christian P. Corvisiero of Middletown, NJ. Family requests that memorial donations may be made in his memory to the Path to Peace Foundation, 25 E. 39th Street, New York, NY 10016.

On the way to booking a 40.8 percent return in 1998, the fund took in more than $2.5 billion in new money. But much of the new cash is ''speculative'' money that could hurt long-term shareholders if the fund's hot streak cools and short-timers bail out, said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's chief executive. So the fund will likely stay closed for six months to a year, and any shares bought on or after April 19 will be subject to a 1 percent redemption fee if sold within five years. The fund isn't having trouble finding places to put its cash, but with inflows like the $564 million during January, it might have eventually developed ''some size constraints,'' said Edward Owens, the fund manager.",1999-02-28T05:00:00+0000

Mary, beloved and admired by those who knew her, possessed a courageous spirit and an inner strength that inspired everyone whose life she touched. A graduate of Smith College, she spent the war years as a reporter in Washington, DC. It was there she met Federico del Villar, a fellow journalist and expatriate Italian nobleman who shared Mary's love of adventure and storytelling. Mary and Fred's desire to ''live real life at last'' took them down many paths including a 750-mile walking trip across the back country of Southern Mexico, a stint as barge operators on the Erie Canal and a job as migrant laborers in the hops fields of California. Out of the Mexican expedition came a book, ''Where the Strange Roads Go Down.'' So did a baby daughter, Jane. Mary finally settled down in Tucson, Arizona, where she earned a Ph.D., and became a Professor of English at the University of Arizona. After Fred's death, Mary lived peacefully on in the Sonoran desert she so loved. In the early 1970s, she remarried and retired from teaching. She and her husband, Howard Porter, a retired Classics professor from Columbia University, lived in Guilford, CT. Mary continued to travel and to write during her life with Howard. She also became mother to three grown children, David, Martha and Michael. These were days of gardens and grandchildren and golden light. When Howard died in 1992, Mary made her home with her daughter, Jane, and son-inlaw, Merrick Gagliano, in a rambling old house in Thornwood, New York, continuing to make annual trips to her beloved Arizona, as long as her health permitted. Jane and Merrick's two children, Jim and Mimi have had the great pleasure of knowing their grandmother as a real part of their lives. We will all treasure our memories of Mary & the strength & courage she has inspired in us. May her journeys continue ''beyond the skyline where the strange roads go down.''

The sugar on the raisins is O.K., though I'd prefer it if it was a bit more natural. I grew up eating croissants, but they don't give you much energy for the morning, and I think I just like Raisin Bran because it's very balanced and I like the texture.
