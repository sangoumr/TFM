us,Film Festival: 'Lancelot':A Bresson 'Spectacle' Inspired by Malory,"It's said that at one time or another every film director yearns to make a spectacle, one of those multimillion-dollar epics with lots of horses, costumes and extras, the sort of film that has to be directed from a raised platform with an electronic voice-magnifying system. To the extent that ""Lancelot of the Lake"" has horses, costumes and extras (a few), and to the extent that it's inspired by some of the tales in Malory's ""Morte D'arthur,"" it may be called Robert Bresson's spectacle, but it's unlike any conventional film spectacle, you've ever seen.The film, which was shown last night at Alice Tully Hall in the New York Film Festival, will be repeated Thursday evening.""Lancelot of The Lake"" is about the last days of King Arthur's Round Table when, after the bloody, fruitless quest for the Holy Grail, the knights return to a fading Camelot and fall out among one another.The age of chivalry is over but no one knows why. Arthur suspects that God has been provoked. He urges his knights to forget their enmities and to better themselves.Lancelot, who once was allowed a vision of the Grail, thinks God is punishing them all for his being Guinevere's lover. When he asks her to release him from his vows to her and to surrender to God, she refuses. ""If I surrender,"" she says, ""it will be to you not God.""Although Mr. Bresson (""Diary of a Country Priest,"" ""Au Hazard, Balthazar,"" ""La Femme Douce,"" etc.) is not especially interested in visual spectacle, he has made a stunning-looking movie that often pares down spectacle to what seems to be an irreducible minimum. Virtually an entire tournament is photographed with the camera's eye focused between the horse's hoofs and midsection.Mr. Bresson once said that the true calling of cinema ""is first to be exact, and then to be interior  rather than exterior or decorative.""""Lancelot"" could never be called decorative, but it is sometimes breathtaking in its exterior details, which is not the same as being realistic. The concluding sequence of the film, after chivalry's final upheaval, is one of the most beautiful and strange the director has ever done:A riderless horse charges aimlessly through a twilight forest as the world's last knight, wounded and dying, staggers slowly toward the bodies of other armor-clad knights. It looks simultaneously mysterious, like the remains of the civilization on another planet, and banal, like a pile of damaged gasoline pumps.What's missing from the film is any urgent interior meaning, and this it may be because of the distractions of the exterior details. It may also be because the conflicts that rage within Lancelot  between duty and desire, courtly love and physical love  simply aren't complex enough to bring out the best in Mr. Bresson. There are times, too, when the armor seems to get in the way of ideas or any sense of passion. There's something essentially comic about the sight of a knight impetuously trying to tear off his gear for a quick roll in the loft.As usual in a Bresson film, the actors are unknowns or nonprofessionals, chosen by the director for their faces and their willingness to be drilled into that state of somnambulance by which he is best able to create his interior visions.Laura Duke Condominas is a lovely, young, girlish Guinevere, who is both passionate and demanding. Luc Simon also looks right as a Lancelot who is no longer young, and whose trials have given a firm set to ascetic features that, in youth, would have seemed soft.In ""Lancelot of the Lake,"" which the director first announced in 1957, the style is intact but the content is missing.",1974-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"' The Night Porter,' Portrait of Abuse, Stars Bogarde","If you don't love pain, you won't find ""The Night Porter"" eroticand by now, even painbuffs may be satiated with Nazi decadence. The movie, which opened yesterday at the Baronet, reunites a former SS officer (Dirk Bogarde) and a young woman (Charlotte Rampling) who was raped by him during her adolescence in a concentration camp. In Vienna, in 1957, they enthusiastically resume their old sadomasochistic relationship, which includes a taste for broken glass.Since the director, Liliana Cavani, made a four-hour documentary on the Third Reich for Italian television, she has a robust background in fascism. Yet her new movie is romantic about abuse. The anguish of the prisoners in the camps is exploited simply for the sake of sensationalismgiven the serial motifs of the film, their suffering is almost made to seem chic. And when Mr. Bogarde and Miss Rampling relive their common past in flashbacks, the titillating build-up to the rape scene is accompanied by ""The Magic Flute,"" which both characters are hearing: Pamina and Tamino sing pledges of undying love while the cruelties grow more intricate. If the friends of Mozart decide to picket on his behalf, I'll be among them.Is this slab of opulent claptrap worth any serious consideration? Yes, because of the talents involvedmainly Mr. Bogarde's. Sensuality and austerity meet and mingle in the face of this impeccable authoritarian, and his silken moments alternate with harsh ones. He's best when he's reservedhis outbursts aren't always successfuland there are a few too many sly, slow smiles. But he's skilled at hiding his feelings from the characters around him while revealing all of his emotions to the audience. When it occurs to him to murder someone, his rigid poise lapses, and he becomes socially awkward  slightly embarrassed and ingratiating at the same time. Occasionally, you recall his performance in ""The Servant,"" but his range is much wider here.Miss Rampling's elegant sternness and low, bitter voice are suitable for her role, but she's a one-dimensional actress who can't convey much beyond tension. Toward the end, she produces one sulky scowl that makes you grateful for a new facial expression. Also, she has the world's most unconvincing laugh  especially when making love. Credibility is a problem throughout the' picturepartly because of Miss Rampling's styles of response. In a scene where she's literally fettered, someone tries to break into her lover's apartment, and she rattles her chains like an apprehensive hostess  just as a nervous partygiver may fidget with her jewelry before the guests arrive.""The Night Porter"" is handsomely filmed in dark, rich tones. But the movie's visual virtues are negated by infinite absurditiesparticularly by the sentimentality with which the director views this luckless couple. Near the finish, we even catch a whiff of an old Hollywood formula, which asks us to regard these lovers as poignant  because the world won't allow them to enjoy each other in peace.All in all, the image that recurs is that of sucking a wound. Meanwhile, if you're in the market for masochism, see Luis Buuel's ""Belle de Jour"" again, or revisit Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Conformist"" for fascist decay. Granted that both are classics. But that's why ""The Night Porter"" shouldn't be allowed to ride on their reputation.",1974-10-02T05:00:00+0000
us,"Caesar,' a Foolish Film, Seen at Fete","""Rome Wants Another Caesar,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last night and will be repeated this evening, comes quite close to being a hysterically funny bad film, a movie of such ridiculous pretentions that it restores a lofty reputation to philistinism.It is an Italian production directed by Miklos Janeso, the Hungarian who once made two good films, ""The Roundup"" and ""The Red and The White,"" which seemed to be pioneering a new kind of epic film making. What impressed many of us about those two early films was the director's extraordinary ability to turn complex historical events into personal political dramas of intense lyricism. In his recent films, Mr. Janeso has pursued his spectacular camera-techniques to a point of no return. The only memorable thing about ""Winter Wind,"" shown here in 1970, was that the entire film consisted of 12 takes (compared to a couple of hundred in an ordinary film). ""Red Psalm,"" shown at the 1972 New York Film Festival, was done in 26 takes. The style added nothing to the movie. it was the movie.""Rome Wants Another Caesar"" looks not quite so inhibited, but it may be Mr. Janeso's most sincerely witless work. It's about some Roman revolutionaries in Numidia in North Africa during the last days of the Roman republic, plotting to assassinate the Roman proconsul and arguing among themselves.That is what it is about, but what we see is a kind of junior high school pageant with a dozen European actors on location in Tunisia, wearing funny looking costumes and carrying swords as if they were eels. That is, awkwardly. Holding hands and dancing around statues of Caesar, they get off such mind-benders as ""The wise man knows that without enemies it's impossible to create friends.""Mr. Janeso isn't really much interested in ancient Rome. He keeps making lugubrious parallels between revolutionaries then and now. Instead of illuminating his subject, he buries it in sand. What the movie is doing in the New York Film Festival, I can't imagine. It is to serious film making what knitting is to a benched football player.It's fooling around.",1974-10-02T05:00:00+0000

He even reproaches her for the kind of bread she buys. He's furious when she leaves the house for work, and the children tend to build dangerous little fires in her absence. There's no apparent friendliness in this marriagethe man and woman seem to share only a nose-wrinkling disgust. As a chemist who prefers research to wageearning, he lets her support him by performing abortionswhich he deplores.From the content, you might think that Alexander Kluge's ""Part-Time Work of a Domestic Slave""which played Tuesday and last night at the New York Film Festivalis sympathetic to women's issues. And I suspect that the director may fancy himself a male feminist. However, ""Slave"" manages to be reactionary in several wayspartly because you can't possibly like either of these one-note characters: the wife (Alexandra Kluge, the director's sister) is presented as a dreary clod, and the husband (Franz Bronski) is just a grouch. The shallowness of the characterization, combined with the pretentious bleakness that runs throughout, results in a paralyzing pessimism that makes the lives depicted seem contemptible.There's an exceptionally grim abortion that should please the Friends of the Foetus  especially since this foetus quivers after it's removed. (Program notes state that the operation was simulated.) The patient appears to be dressed for a festive occasion (indeed, who would wear an off-the-shoulder blouse to her abortion?). It's hard to know what this scene is supposed to proveunless it's a device to establish the director's toughness.The husband reluctantly takes a job, and the wife becomes a political activist. Most of the time, she's hopelessly inefficient, naive, and ineffective. Her social concerns are made to appear faddish, until she manages to rally the workers at her husband's firm against the management. Hence her husbandwho doesn't like her politicsis fired. The conclusion implies that the effort for change is useless. All in all, the movie would be depressing if it weren't so dull.Also on the program is a marvelous adaptation of Henry James's ""The Bench of Desolation,"" directed by Claude Chabrol for television. A fastidious man is faced with a breach of promise suit by a woman who eventually makes him pay a sum that plummets him into a lifetime of debt and destroys his marriage.Years later, the woman reappears and offers to repay himwith interest. Her love and her revenge took the same form: of making money for him (and out of him), and of creating his need for her. She has blighted his life so that she may later have the chance to comfort himthat is, if he no longer loathes her.The James tale respects the pain of both charactersthe rejected woman and the crippled manwhile stressing her appalling ruthlessness and condemning the aptitude for suffering plus the dread of vulgarity that made him unable to defy her. (She's also the kind of controlling, semi-maternal figure that frightened James himself.)The movie is faithful to the original, and it's admirably performed. Catherine Samie achieves an extraordinary shift of character: early on, she's formidable, threatening in her upright posture; later, she's extremely touching, also acrid and sensitive by turns. Meanwhile, the contrast between Michel Duchaussoy's cautious glares and his moments of raw suffering fully express his sense of a wasted life. These people even have the pallor that James described, and the film is merely a small triumph for Mr. Chabrol.",1974-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Professor Bucks Odds in 'The Gambler':Caan, in the Title Role, Fights Compulsion","Axel Freed (James Caan), the young New York English professor, the hero of Karel Reisz's ""The Gambler,"" has a ravenous monkey on his back. Axel loves to gamble. He'll bet on anything for staggering stakes. More than winning he likes the uncertaintly, the threat of disaster that, ultimately, is death or its reasonable facsimile.At the beginning of the film, Axel has just lost $44,000, which he doesn't have, and by the time the film ends he's even worse off, though he may be happy because, momentarily, anyway, he's achieved the terrible humiliation he's apparently been seeking all along.""The Gambler,"" which opened yesterday at Loews Tower East Theater, was written by James Toback who, in his first film, becomes the author of some of the most disabling dialogue to be imposed on any serious movie in years. But more about that later.Compulsive gamblers are very special cases. Mr. Reisz, the director of several notable English films (""This Sporting Life."" ""Morgan,"" ""Isadora""), and Mr. Toback have no special interest in treating Axel as a psychoanalytic case, though they provide some basic information if anyone else wants to go into that.Axel's father is nowhere on the family scene. His mother, Naomi (Jacqueline Brooks), is a successful medical doctor, a self-sufficient, liberated sort of woman who might have had man-to-man talks with her son when he was 12 years old.Observing the family from a walled-in compound in Riverdale is Axel's grandfather, A. R. Lowenthal (Morris Carnovsky), a self-made millionaire (a chain of furniture stores) who is probably a good deal less kindly than the movie would want us to believe.The movie prefers to consider Axel almost romantically, as a kind of artist whose misspent life is his work-in-progress. Axel himself brushes aside all efforts of friends and family to make him see himself as sick.""My, god, Axel,"" his mother says at one point, in a line that Woody Allen might have written for laughs, ""have I been such a failure as a mother that I've raised a son with the morals of a snake?"" Says Axel's girlfriend (Lauren Hutton), ""I don't understand any of it."" Replies Axel: ""It's just something I like to do.""The movie follows Axel's downward path with such care that you keep thinking there must be some illuminating purpose, but there isn't. ""The Gambler"" is a very small movie, sometimes with embarrassing delusions of grandeur as when Axel quotes E. E. Cummings (""Buffalo Bill's defunct"") or lectures his class on William Carlos Williams and Dostoyevsky. Mr. Toback writes as if he were a literature groupie, snatching at bits and pieces of other men's ideas for the loose-leaf album that eventually became his screenplay.His original inspirations tend to a particular awfulness. Early in the film there's a scene in which Axel accompanies his mother to the bank where she wants to withdraw money to pay Axel's debts. The bank man insists on two pieces of identification, though Naomi has only her driver's license. At this point Axel grabs the bank man and shouts: ""Look, I came out of her womb and telling you she's Naomi Freed!""Each one of us, I suppose, is someone else's I.D. card, but that's not what ""The Gambler"" is all about.Mr. Reisz and Mr. Toback reportedly worked a couple of years putting the screenplay into this shape, which is lifeless The physical production, shot mostly in New York, looks good and Mr. Caan is generally convincing, except in those classroom scenes, but all of the other actors, with the exception of James Sorvino who plays a sympathetic bookie, seem defeated by the quality of the material.",1974-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,At Film Festival: 'A Bigger Splash':5 Shorts at Whitney,"""A Bigger Splash,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last night, is a fiction film about David Hockney, one of the more successful and durable of the English pop artists to come out of the nineteen-sixties, in which Mr. Hockney and his friends play themselves in situations that may or may not have happened in life.A note in the festival program draws a parallel between what Jack Hazan, the director-cameraman-producer of this film, is doing in ""A Bigger Splash"" and what Mr. Hockney's paintings do when the artist takes details from life, strips them to their essential lines and colors, then projects them into larger-than-life reality onto huge canvases.Perhaps because most movie screens, including the one at Alice Tully Hall (where the film will be repeated tonight), are already larger than life, the effect of this fragmented, often self-conscious film is to make the subject seem sort of small and drab, a fact that is immediately denied whenever we are given a chance to look at the paintings themselves.There is a kind of story line to the film, which, we're told, was three years in the making. It's about Mr. Hockney's inability to finish a painting when his lover for the last five years, another artist named Peter Schlesinger, walks out on him. His friends worry about him. They worry about a forthcoming show, and they worry about the dcor of his house. ""It looks like a waiting room now,"" says Celia Birtwell, a beautiful young woman who looks a lot like Andy Warhol's Viva. Another friend says, ""When love goes wrong, it's more than two people suffer.""In these moments, there's a suggestion of the satire that is almost always evident in Mr. Hockney's paintings, but the film's Hockney-like gags are mostly blunt, as when Henry Geldzahler of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is ""discovered"" striking the pose in which Mr. Hockney once painted him.The manner of making the filmin London, Geneva, California and New York, whenever the artist's schedule permittedhas as much to do with the non-content of the film as with its style. There are only the slightest traces of the outrageous self-promotion and put-on that once were so much a part of the pop scene. ""A Bigger Splash"" is unforgivably solemn, something that Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey would never have allowed.5 Shorts at Whitney""Transformations"" is the blanket title covering a well-organized exhibition of five short films exploring motion pictures as the vehicle of expression of pure art. The exhibition opened yesterday for a week's run in the New American Filmmakers Series at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Of the five, which range in length from 6 to 35 minutes, the least imaginative was ""Birds of Paradise,"" by Mike Lovell, in which the soaking of film in bleach produced whitened patterns washing across repetitive shots of caged vultures.More active and successful in working out thematic variations were Steve Osborn with ""Polyphemus,"" a piece of cinematic choreography that makes the camera and a mirror partners in a contredanse; Sheldon Brown's ""Clean Gate!!,"" fugal in the increasing complexity of its patterns; Mr. Brown's ""Frame/Rate Declension"" in which juxtaposed vertical film strips moving at changing speeds provide a tapestry of images, and David Hykes's ""Moving Parts,"" a combination of eerie sound and colored particles that form a kaleidoscopic universe, at once pastoral and nightmarish.",1974-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,At the Film Festival:'Ali':Fassbinder Explore Racial Prejudice The Cast New Tanner Film Opens Emotions,"One of the most encouraging things about Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the young German writer-director-actor, is his extraordinary productivity, not that productivity is much help to someone without talent. There's no question that Mr. Fassbinder, whose ""Ali"" was shown at the New York Film Festival on Saturday and yesterday evenings, has a great deal of talent, so much that he seems driven by it in the healthiest sense.Since 1969 he has made at least 11 films, written several plays for the theater, acted in others and written and directed an eight-part television drama. I mention all this because such a large part of a film director's life these days must be devoted either to deal-making or to rewriting and polishing scripts for the approval of people who have easier access to money than to any artistic sensibility.Mr. Fassbinder obviously works fast. He doesn't fool around getting things perfect. He tries something difficult, and if it works, fine. If not, he'll do it better the next time around. Shakesspeare worked this way. So, I'm sure, did a lot of the people in Hollywood in what are called the good old days. Experience doesn't accumulate like dust. You simply can't sit around waiting for it to settle on you. You have to work to get it.Mr. Fassbinder is neither Shakespeare nor an old-time Hollywood type. In addition to his talent and tremendous energy, he has absolutely no fear that he might be off on the wrong track making a fool of himself. His most recent films seen over here, ""The Merchant of Four Seasons"" and ""The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,"" have been both praised and ridiculed in the kind of extravagant terms that make one pay attention, even when not agreeing.I particularly liked one of his early works (if one can decently call a film by someone who's not yet 30 an early work). ""Recruits in Ingoistadt,"" which was an effectively stylized screen adaptation of a 1929 Brechtian theater piece, shown at the 1971 New York Film Festival.I like ""Ali"" even more because it seems to take even greater risks. Its story is the cinematic equivalent of a piece of pop art: Emmi (Brigitte Mira) is a late-fiftyish German charwoman, a widow whose children have grown up and into proper middle-class prigs. Emmi is no femme fatale. She's short and dumpy and has a too-great willingness to please, a quality she shares with many of the world's lonely and insecure.Quite by chance, Emmi meets Ali, a young, virile Moroccan who has come to Germany to earn a living as a garage mechanic. They are both lonely. Emmi's friendliness and her common sense, as well as her apartment, beckon Ali. They get married for their own satisfaction and to the horror of family and friends.The careful detail with which Mr. Fassbinder dramatizes the couple's subsequent ostracism, and the rampant racial prejudice they face, is a deadpan cover for the film's real concerns, which, as I read the film, are the many disguises of love. In one of the several twists that Mr. Fassbinder gives the story, it's Emmi who, once secure in Ali's love, reverts to type, becoming small-minded and in her own way thoroughly heartless.The presence of the director is so dominant in Mr. Fassbinder's films that it's difficult to judge their individual parts. I'm not sure whether Miss Mira and El Hedi Ben Salem, who plays Ali, are especially good actors but they look right. Although they have their idiosyncracies they are primarily types.The entire film, in fact, has a kind of posterlike blandness to it, something that at times is made visual. When Emmi and Ali go outside, other people are seldom seen, unless they are characters in the film. There are no extras in the background to convince you this is photographed reality, which it most certainly is not.""Ali"" is not an easy movie to warm up to. It's no May-December romance that tugs at the heart. It is, rather, another quite courageous attempt by Mr. Fassbinder to develop a film style free of the kind of realistic conventions that sentimentalize life's mysteries.",1974-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Kitsch and camp collide in this storm of pity and terror and wonder, which seethes with boundless love, burning glances, and unfathomable revenge. Nestling within this Swiss movie are some humorous intentions gone astray; it's also what they call dreamlike, although the dreams I've been watching lately have been funnier.A glum nightclub singerIngrid Caven, who's tricked out like a caricature of Dietrich  is ailing with some nameless rot. She permits a wealthy young admirer (Peter Kern) to cosset her, cure her, and finally marry her. It's repeated that she doesn't love him, but she cherishes his passion for her. Then she falls for his best friend and wants to decamp with him; her husband selfishly refuses to finance the expedition. Therefore, she dies slowly and even more tidily than Ali McGraw in ""Lovy Story.""Her deathbed wish forces her husband to exhume and dismember her three years later; the corpse chuckles as he moans while converting it into cutlets. By then, since I was into the swing of the movie, I expected poisonous fumes to rise from the coffin and wipe out the suffering spouseand was rather embarrassed when they didn't.Some obligatory decadence trickles through the nightclub scenesbut mercifully, the movie is set in 1952, so there aren't any Nazis around. The soundtrack endows the actors with theme-tunes; occasionally, they even flower into song, and the incidental music ranges from an opera by Erich Korngold to ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree."" Just after the couple are married, there's a soaring duet on a mountaintop. Suddenly, a transparent apparition floats over their heads: the thing grins jovially while its draperies flap in a breeze that doesn't even ruffle their coiffures.You can't really discuss ""La Paloma"" in terms of acting; the performers stalk rigidly about, exchanging long, brooding stares or significant smirks, and the result is a failed parody of the grand manner. (It was probably meant to be some sort of pantomime.) They also speak their lines very, very slowly  as though one another's reflexes were impaired.The ultimate astonishment is the appearance of Bulle Ogier as the husband's mother. Looking younger than her offspring, she doesn't seem to be on good terms with her cane. If only Elaine May had directed ""La Paloma""  the brisk deadpan delivery that she can draw out of actors might have been marvelous for this material.",1974-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Passer's 'Law and Disorder':Farce Slides Between Humor and Despair The Cast O'Conner Is a Cabbie Borgnine a Coffeur,"Ivan Passer's ""Law and Disorder"" is a gentle, touching, sometimes disruptively funny movie aboutamong other things  ignorance, prejudice, rape, larceny, the failure of small dreams, about people trying desperately to cope and often coming apart.It stars Carroll O'Connor as a taxicab driver and Ernest Borgnine as an ex-Marine, who is a hairdresser with a passion for guns. They are the nucleus of a small group of outraged tenants of a housing project called Co-op Village, set on the Lower East Side of a New York City that bears some superficial resemblance to the setting of the inexecrable ""Death Wish.""""Law and Disorder,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet and Little Carnegie theaters, is the second American film by Mr. Passer (his first was ""Born to Win"") whose ""Intimate Lighting"" is regarded as one of the major achievements of the brief, mysterious renaissance of Czechoslovak films in the nineteen-sixties.His new film is a poet's appreciation of lives lived on the edge of the precipice by people whose finger-holds are giving out.Willie (Mr. O'Connor) and Cy (Mr. Borgnine) and their friends are threatened as much by the onset of barren middle age as they are by the collapse of civil order. Thus, when they form a police auxiliary unit to protect their neighborhood, they are as invigorated by the opportunity to wear uniforms as they are by the opportunity to bring peace to the community.Perhaps more so. The uniforms define purpose. They recall a more innocent time, say World War II, when there was never any question as to who was right and who was wrong.The ultimate failure of Willie, Cy and the others is less a comment on their inadequacies, often hilariously detailed, than on the overwhelming complexity of the urban problems they face. It's this awareness on the part of Mr. Passer, as well as on the part of William Richert and Kenneth Harris Fishman, who collaborated with the director on the script, that separates ""Law and Disorder"" from exploitation junk like ""Death Wish.""It also dictates the mood of a film that slides between farce and melodrama, between high good humor and enervating despair. Some of Mr. Passer's characters, like Willie, continue to try to improve things. Willie dreams of a new career. He wants to sell his taxi medallion and buy a lunch counter, much to his wife's horror. Says Willie in desperation: ""I ain't a failure, Sally, I just ain't on time.""Cy, the hairdresser, is a hunter. He keeps an entire stuffed deer in the bedroom and has a piranha fish in a tank in the living room. He doesn't hunt people, however, and he hasn't quite arrived at the point occupied by most of the other citizens of the city whose motto, repeatedly expressed, is an obscene two-word imperative.The film is not perfect but I couldn't care less. A number of characters are as dimly seen as faces across a subway car. The sense of alienation that grips the city at times seizes the film itself, though almost always in fascinating ways. A film of less consistent intelligence would probably be destroyed by a scene so pricelessly funny it's almost a specialty number, when the auxiliary policemen and their wives attend a lecture on rape by ""the author of the best-selling book, 'Sexual Deviations of the Seventies.'""""Law and Disorder"" is full of eccentric things, one of the most marvelous being Karen Black, who plays a lasciviously lunatic beautician who simply can't keep her tongue in place. Mr. O'Connor reins in his familiar Archie Bunker personality to give a fine, controlled performance as the stalwart Willie, while Mr. Borgnine is inspired casting as the unhappy hairdresser.""Law and Disorder"" has none of the vicarious thrills of ""Death Wish."" It's thoughtful about people, even vicious hoods. It's also very, very funny.",1974-10-10T05:00:00+0000

They and their company are as unusual as might be expected but they leave a viewer uncommitted, if not confused, by their largely far-out, somber fiction.The script by Ranald Graham, a young newcomer to films, is described as ""a grim fairy tale,"" and it is just that. It involves Mr. Marceau in the dual roles of a mute puppeteer and as his employer, an odd, aged inventor, Old Walker, of gadgets, who can revive the dead. These improbable, but handy, tools enable him to animate Old Walker, his wicked sister-in-law and her drunken husband and a young girl who adores him, after they have died, to successfully fight the forces of evil represented by a gang of wild motorcyclists.Mr. Marceau, who has been seen in several films including ""Barbarella,"" does not achieve the remarkable illusions he has created on stage. But his silent performances as the wistful, badgered Shanks and the wonderfully made-up senile Old Walker are, nevertheless, strikingly charming pantomimes on screen.He is ably abetted by Tsilla Chelton and Philippe Clay, French mime artists who are making their movie debuts here as the relatives with as much dedication as Mr. Marceau, and Cindy Eilbacher, a newcomer from TV, as the wide-eyed youngster in love with the puppeteer's magic.But the magic here is diffused.

Middle-class life is wretched, says Mr. Olmi. It's dehumanizing. We're almost like cattle, he goes on to say, showing us scenes in the stockyards in which cattle are led up ramps, then slaughtered. Mr. Olmi is not a director to let a clich die peacefully.He makes movies with a petty file clerk's love for the nonessential detail and a bad writer's total inability to fabricate spontaneity. The festival program describes Mr. Olmi's editing technique in ""La Circostanza"" as ""more aggressive"" than it's been in the past, in his earlier, much better films, like ""Il Posto"" and ""The Fiancs.""I don't know if it's really more aggressive or just film-school fancy. There are lots of fragmented flashbacks and flash-forwards, but they don't add anything. It just takes one a little longer to realize fully the film's complete lack of excitement.""Lacombe, Lucien,"" which opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, was shown at the 12th New York Film Festival.

All day, except for a long, midday break, shopkeepers displaying and hawking their wares from tantalizing displays on the sidewalks turn the winding old street into a cheerful marketplace. The street cries of Paris survive there as merchants striving to reduce mountains of mussels try to outshout sellers of artfully dressed rabbits to gain the attention of choosy housewives and as women vaunt the ripeness of their Camemberts in competition with others offering the last of their string beans at reduced prices. Street children can still be caught chalking uncomplicated words on sidewalks and cheerfully thumbing their noses at their elders.

us,Nabokov as his own halfhero,"After Joyce with his portrait of Stephen, after Proust with his remembrance of Marcel, there are few reasons to be surprised, and many reasons to be disappointed, by the complicated interplay between Vladimir Nabokov and the narrator of this, his 37th book. Vadim Vadimovitch is a Russian emigr writer and a mirror image or double of Nabokov as man and writer; but unlike Proust or Joyce, Nabokov never uses this version of himself as a way of questioning the authenticity of his own identity. The fictional self never challenges the real or authorial self. Nabokov and his works hover on the margins of the text, so to speak, as a static reality against which Vadim is to be measured. So that while the style of the novel is characteristically brilliant when it comes to erotic comedy or setting a scene or sketching in minor figures, it is deficient in another and far more important way. It lacks the dramatic intensifications, the exploratory feeling that in Joyce and Proustand in our own time very often in Maileris a consequence of their wonderfully vital, vulnerable, intimidated (and not simply intimidating) relationship to fictional copies of themselves.",1974-10-13T05:00:00+0000

The original title of the collection or, rather, selectionwhen it appeared in 1935 was Time: The Present, and so alive is Tess Slesinger's voice that she makes her times, which were intensely important to her, seem present again to us, dwellers in a very different decade. Yet Tess Slesinger died of cancer in 1945, at the age of 39. She had been considered one of the more promising young writers of the 1930's (as well as one of the most personable, according to Twentieth Century Authors, with a smile as vivid as her literary style) on the basis of her stories and her one ovel, The Unpossessed. (Alas, it is out of print.) But the last 10 years of her life, spent writing screenplays in Hollywood (The Good Earth, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn), did not live up to the rough promise of the novel or the more finished brilliance of her best stories. A lesson in carpe diem if there ever was one. But such times of silence in a writer's life often bear riper fruit, and premature death is cruelest when it decrees barren what may have been time of growth and gathering forces. Tess Slesinger left notebooks that suggested she meant to get back to fiction and I believe she would have, in her forties, and further that she would have outgrown the slight tendency to mannerism and the bright and strenuous consciousness that occasionally mar her early fiction. We'll never know. Reviewing her gives me a particular sense of futility because in her writing she is so very much alive.",1974-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Any number of first books by eely, quick and yet encompassing new talents would refute the idea. If a tugofwar were waged between the young and serious novelists round about and the serious young journalists, the latter might well win, both with respect to giftedness and numbers. They are beset with opportunitiesup to the Adam's apple in opportunitiesperhaps including the possibility of accomplishing something. Journalism itself in fact is the theater of operations toward which a literary youngster who still believes in the American dream would naturally incline: where it might appear to him that if he tackles a large project and works hard at it he can become rich and famous, though he may be writing about the overall destruction of the American dream.

Overwhelmed by both the performance and the play, Barrault invited the company to come to Paris under the auspices of the Thatre des Nations, the international theater festival which he then ran. Both the players and the dramatist were delighted, but the Minister of Culture of the Province of Quebec refused to grant funds to support their journey, and the arrangement fell through. It seems that the Minister of Culture felt the play did not offer a sufficiently complimentary picture of life in Quebec, and, in particular, its language was objectionable. The dramatist, a Quebec separatist named Michel Tremblay, had done something quite unprecedented. He had used the actual language of Quebec's working class.

us,BrilliantB un u el Film Closes 12th Festival:The Cast,"After 17 days of good, bad, and mostly indifferent films, the 12th annual New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center closed triumphantly last night with the American premiere of Luis Buuel's brilliant, anarchic new comedy, ""Le Fantme de la Libert"" (The Specter of Freedom""), which will begin its commercial run at the Paris Theater here on Oct. 27.The premiere of ""Fantme"" came the day after the festival's homage to Mr. Buuel in the form of the retrospective showing of four of his earlier works, ""L'Age D'Or"" (1930), made in collaboration with Salvador Dali, ""The Exterminating Angel"" (1962), ""The Milky Way"" (1969) and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" (1972). This had the effect of italicizing what we have all been saying for years: the Buuel talent has continued to grow and refine itself at that period in a film maker's life when he is ordinarily expected to taper off, if not retire to campus or swimming pool.Mr. Buuel must be awfully tired of people going on and on about his age. (He'll be 75 nex February.) Yet the subject is pertinent when so few film makers have endured long enough to give us the benefit of the wit and wisdom that come only from living through decades of changing fashions. Writers, painters, musicians and composers survive into creative old age. Film makers have a way of wearing out too soon, like American automobiles. Not Luis Buuel.In ""Le Fantme de la Libert"" Mr. Buuel and Jean-Claude Carrire, who has collaborated with the director on all of his feature films since ""Diary of a Chambermaid"" (1964), contemplate man's survival in spite of his idiocies. I'm not at all sure the film has as much to do with specific ideas about freedom as the title would imply. Rather, I suspect, the concept of freedom as touched upon in the film is just another in the system of reversalsone of dozens of dumbfounding paradoxes  that so fascinate and amuse this most free yet most disciplined of film makers.""Le Fantme de le Libert"" is not for people who see movies as butterflies, trophies to be netted, pinned down, then pulled apart with tweezers. The movie can't be pinned down. There's no single correct way to read it, which is not a rationale for its ambiguities, but a rigorous instruction to those who would enjoy all that is most marvelous and poetic in surrealism at its best.The film opens in Toledo in 1808 as Napoleon's soldiers attempt to liberate Spain and summarily shoot all citizens who refuse to be liberated. ""Down with liberty!"" is the heroic cry of one of the victims standing before a Goya-like firing squad.Thereupon the camera follows a French officer who, being slightly drunk on communion wine and stuffed with communion wafers, becomes enchanted by the beauty of the statue of a knight's wife on a sepulcher in the cathedral they're then violating. As the officer bends to kiss the statue, the stone hand of the knight's figure gives the officer a terrific swat, so enraging the officer he vows to take his pleasure with the dead lady, whose coffin, they find, is filled with paraphernalia.""Paraphernalia?"" asks a woman sitting in a park in modern-day Paris. ""What is par-a-pher-na-lia?"" The woman, a nanny, has been reading aloud to a friend the story we've been watching, at which point ""Le Fantme"" moves into another story, that of the nanny, her small charge, a little girl who is given what seem to be obscene postcards by a strange man, and the girl's parents, who are so outraged by the postcards (pictures of Ntre Dame, Sacr Coeur and the like) that they sack the nanny on the spot.""Le Fantme de la Libert"" is dozens of stories that lead from one to another with a dreamlike logic, and a dream-like way of never quite arriving at a neatly satisfactory conclusion. Among the characters who turn up are a courteous sniper, who shoots a couple of dozen people from the top of Montparnasse sky-scraper at the edge of Paris and becomes a celebrity; a group of poker-playing monks, a little girl who vanishes from school but is able to accompany her parents to the police station where she gives her own vital statistics, even though no one acknowledges her presence.More than any other Bunel film ""Le Fantme"" recalls ""L'Age D'Or"" with its riddles, jokes, outrageous associations, contradictions and dim view of reason's power. ""Le Fantme"" is no less dense with symbols (for those who care about such things), but the style is more precise, less heavy, much funnier, no less mysterious, yet so economical that when he ridicules the arbitrariness of a social convention, like table manners, he manages also to make a few pithy observations on ecology.The physical production is stunning to look at.

us,'A Woman Under Influence' Stars Gena Rowlands as Frenetic Wife:The Cast,"When a husband and wife need to keep saying how much they love each other, something's apt to be awfully wrong. That nervous repetition is one of the danger signals in John Cassavetes's ""A Woman Under the Influence,"" and it contains all the warning urgency of a siren. The movie played on Saturday at the New York Film Festival.Throughout, the film dwells on the abrasions of daily living, centered in the domestic world where each individual grinds on the other's nerves. Gena Rowlands plays a woman adrift. Her manic, likable, hard-hat husband (Peter Falk) quite hysterically keeps assuring her that everything's fine. Meanwhile, she looks to him for her identity, asking him to tell her ""what"" to be, insisting that she'll ""be anything"" he wants. Later, he punctuates a horrendous uproar by shouting ""Just be yourself!"" But she hardly has a selfbeyond the bundle of symptoms that make up her hectic public persona.Miss Rowlands unleashes an extraordinary characterization of a harried, anxious creature, who's convinced that she ""makes a jerk of"" herself every day. (The actresses' style of performing sometimes shows a kinship with that of the early Kim Stanley or the recent Joanne Woodward, but the notes of desperation are emphatically her own.) Despair lurks behind her smilewhich often collapses suddenlyas she jabbers, hums or retreats to a little-girl manner. Pantomime is one of her defenses. She mugs with exasperation, working her jaw and rolling her eyes when she's annoyed or throwing indignant punches into the air. When frenzy gives way to apology, her mouth tightens with resentment, which then yields to a miserable leer. With her three small children, she's wildly demonstrativeshe seems to be pleading for their affection; trying to be a fellow-child who plays their games.A troubled person, yes, and certainly an insecure one. But she doesn't seem sick or crazed enough to justify the crack-up that's awaiting her, nor to spend six months in a sanitarium. And that's the hitch in the movie: you can't really tell how the director regards this character. Mr. Cassavetes is unquestionably sympathetic to the rootless state of the middle-American housewife. (Moreover, the hospitalization is meant to seem like a betrayal by the husband.)Butperhaps unintentionallyhe has made the man appear much crazier than his wife; are we supposed to assume that his frantic nature has driven her over the edge? Or are we meant to see madness as contagious? Ultimately, the essential problems of this woman remain unclear: we're shown her behavior, but not what inspired it.The movie is also a study in embarrassmentsince that's the dominant emotion shared by everyone who encounters this head-long person. There's also a conscientious effort to show a continuing relationship, but the picture doesn't touch a common nerve in the way that Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes From a Marriage"" doesbecause a number of moments that could be moving or touching are made to be farcical.Peter Falk gives a rousing performance as the man who lives at a perpetual bursting point, and the children are very well directed. But the movie didn't need to be 2 hours and 35 minutes long: there's too much small talk, which doesn't really reveal character. Still, the most frightening scenes are extremely compelling, and this is a thoughtful film that does prompt serious discussion.",1974-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Miss Signoret Excels in 'Widow Couderc':The Cast,"Since Simone Signoret appears in all too few movies these days, it's so good to see her on the screen that one tends to be almost undemanding of the picturewhich, in this case, is a modest film of high quality that never quite gets off the ground, despite its many fine details and a beautiful evocation of the French countryside.In Pierre Granier-Deferre's ""The Widow Couderc,"" which opened yesterday at the Playboy Theater, Miss Signoret is a widowed farm woman who shelters a murderer on the lam (Alain Delon). With deft, swift movements, she conveys the authority of a person who has wrenched a living out of the land. Cutting hay, digging or hoeing, washing laundry in a stream, slicing meat, she makes us momentarily forget all the worldly or urban roles that she has played so superblyhere, she's the total peasant.Hard work and hard times have armored the widow against almost any form of indulgence. Hence Miss Signoret is also very touching as a stern, aging woman who falls reluctantly in love with a footloose young man. As in some of her other movies, there's the hopeful half-smile that appears when she likes someone, or the wistful appreciation that she reveals after making love.The man also sleeps with a mindless adolescent (Ottavia Piccolovery good.) Then the widow's in-laws, who hate her, identify him to the police. The movie was adapted from a novel by Georges Simenon; the director is respectful of its characters, and their situation might even have the stuff of tragedy. However, Mr. Delon's role and his performance are too thin and elusiveso we can't care greatly when his life's in jeopardy.The actor just doesn't use the vitality that he has brought to some of his earlier parts; instead, he's almost phlegmatic, andnot for the first timehe seems to be thinking of James Dean. (A nice thought, admittedly, but one that's hardly rooted in the French working class.) Since Miss Signoret has all the strength to move us, it's worth wishing that the director had made her opposite number more substantial.",1974-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie Documents Auction of Scull's Art,"Many people are going to enjoy ""America's Pop Collector: Robert C. ScullContemporary Art at Auction,"" but I especially recommend it to publishers and movie makerssince this documentary makes the book or film industries look pure and pastoral in comparison to the art world. The movie, which was ""conceptualized and co-ordinated"" by E. J. Vaughn and John Schott, and filmed by Susan and Alan Raymond, opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and will run until Tuesday.Once you've witnessed the October, 1973, auction of 50 works of art from the collection of the taxi tycoon Robert Scullthe sale brought him $2,240,900you may be glad that you don't paint, sculpture, own, sell, or buy contemporary artwhich appears to addle many who come in contact with it. In fact, the movie makes the audience feel superior to those on screena sensation that's always pleasing, whether it's justified or not.The sale included works by Willem de Kooning, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Franz Kline, Barnett Newman, Larry Poons, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist. When asked why he chose to sell his possessions, Mr. Scull answers repeatedly that the exhibition at Parke Bernet was the only way that he could see these paintings, sculptures and constructions together; he emphasizes the lack of space in his apartment, remarking that many pieces had been in storage. (Apparently, he had to part with these things in order to look at them.) He adds that owning art is ""a different kind of high."" Others criticize him for loving publicity, though he's also credited for his adventurousness in buying difficult works when they weren't popular, and Robert Rauschenberg stresses that the Sculls helped artists at a period ""when there wasn't enough activity to support them.""Meanwhile, some are distressed at seeing these works leave the country. And although the question of artists' royalties isn't discussed in this film, it does raise the issue of a collector's making such gargantuan profits when the artists receive none. (Mr. Scull, who dodges queries about art as an investment, gets quite huffy about profits; he insists that he's raising the artists' price for their future work.) Throughout, he comes through as jovial and benign; though the film mocks him, he's allowed to appear likable.In this documentary, the works of art are definitely treated as objectsthey're filmed very casually, without perception or respect. It's hard to tell if this was totally intentional  if the film makers deliberately presented paintings and sculptures in the spirit of the market place, or if they were also somewhat insensitive. However, it's gripping to see the stuff handled about as tenderly as the airlines treat your luggage: a Larry Poons painting slips while it's being hung, and two Jasper Johns beer cans are shoved around as though they came straight from Ballantine's. All in all, there's a sense of no deposit, no return.Some of the best parts of the film are the preparations for the auction; the ushers are instructed to ""be forceful without being rude"" and to make people sit in their assigned seatswhich were ""thoroughly researched"" in light of most individuals' bidding records. The film is a very amusing putdown of an occasion that doesn't inspire reverence. Of course it's an easy target. But since the artists' talent or diligence are made to seem irrelevant, our laughter at those who were enriched by their work can refresh us in fierce economic times.",1974-10-17T05:00:00+0000

This time the job is goldmining in South Africa, where most of the film was made with, I suspect, lots of cooperation.The story is about an evil plan to control the international price of gold by sabotaging one of the country's largest gold mines by flooding it with an underground sea. The plan is nicked in the last reel by Roger Moore, standing up to his neck in swirling mineshaft waters, with the help of Simon Sabela, who plays his trusted black friend. Because ""Gold"" has the social conscience of a dim-witted ostrich, you expect Mr. Moore at any minute to refer to Mr. Sabela as a good darkie.In addition to Mr. Moore and Mr. Sabela, the cast includes Ray Milland, as the kind, crusty old white millionaire who owns the mine and is called ""Pops"" by his bored, beautiful granddaughter, Susannah York, who is married to cold, mean Bradford Dillman, one of the chief plotters along with elegant, detached John Gielgud, an international tycoon not above a little murder. Without exception they all are dreadful.The movie was directed by Peter Hunt, who directed ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" the worst Bond film ever. Mr. Hunt's sense of style is summed up in his decision to photograph the beginning of one scene through a brandy glass.

us,The Screen:Dodes'ka-den' Reflects Shanty Life in Japan,"Never having read Shugoro Yamamoto's ""The Town Without Seasons,"" I cannot be too certain how faithfully Akira Kurosawa has followed its text in his adaptation, ""Dodes'ka-den,"" now playing at the First Avenue Screening Room.But judging by what is visible on screen, the novel must have been a rather slick, episodic work, one of those ""good reads"" that pokes its nose behind closed doors into the lives of ""little people"" to sniff out a heady mixture of scandal, sentiment and spiritual uplift.These, certainly, are the principal findings of ""Dodes'ka-den"" (""The Song of the Trolley), as it weaves its way through a shanty town sprouting out of a wasteland of refuse. Among the characters in the forefront is the demented boy who spends his days commanding an imaginary trolley into and out of the town; the father and son who inhabit the shell of a car and plan a dream house; the wise and compassionate old artisan who is kind to burglars and confounding to enraged drunks; the two drunken laborers who swap wives; and the cuckold who illustrates the distinction between parenthood and fatherhood.There is also the spiritually dead man who will never forgive his wife her indiscretion; the deformed, tic-ridden clerk and his surly wife; and the frail, unhappy girl who makes artificial flowers and is abused by her stepfather And, out in the midst of all the shanties, a group of women spending all day at the communal water spigot acts the role of a chorus.The unifying image is that of the trolley, and the trolley is on a shuttle run. Like the people in the movie, it is going nowhere. All are anchored in their poverty. Some are oblivious to it; some dream their way above it; some are afflicted with more distractingeven more agonizingburdens.""Dodes'ka-den"" is smooth, Mr. Kurosawa's first color film, and he is clearly enchanted by its possibilities, drenching the screen with hues, using them to establish mood and identify characters; to transport the audience into surreal realms dominated by dreams and death.Dodes'ka-den is smooth, handsome and well-acted. Those caret its virtues. Its overriding fault is an acceptance of superficiality. In place of profundity, it gives us gossip.""",1974-10-18T05:00:00+0000

The two films are very much alike; only, the planes and the names of the characters have been changed to amuse the innocent.Like its predecessor, ""Airport 1975"" is carefully designed not to bring up any subject as touchy as air safety and traffic control, even though it's about a midair collision. A great deal is made of the fact that the collision is a result of what might be called a private failing, and that, anyway, the 747 is ""the best aircraft ever made.""The crisis in ""Airport 1975"" occurs when the pilot of a private plane has a heart attack and plunges his small craft into the cockpit of a 747 en route from Washington to Los Angeles, either killing or maiming the members of the jetliner's flight crew.Who is left aboard the big plane to handle the controls until some sort of help can arrive?Who will be able to steer it, more or less, through mountain passes, receiving her instructions through the headphones of the damaged radio, looking distraught from time to time, but game and pretty throughout?By golly, you've guessed it, but I shouldn't give away any more of the plot. He who gives away the plot of a movie like this gives away its soul.Karen Black plays the spunky stewardess, and Charlton Heston plays her boyfriend, the man who saves the day in a daring plane-to-plane pilot transfer that prompts someone to say in all seriousness: ""This is plain suicide, sir!""There are a lot of exclamation points in this movie, which is also extremely polite, even in its crises. Worse failings are its smugness (""The public's right to know gives me huge pain in the ,"" says a righteous airline executive of a pushy TV reporter) and a total lack of awareness of how comic it is when it's attempting to be most serious.The supporting characters include a little girl en route to a kidney transplant (played by Linda Blair with all of the navet of a Vegas showgirl); a singing nun (Helen Reddy), a lady who drinks with two fists (Myrna Loy), another nun who doesn't sing (Martha Scott) and Gloria Swanson (played by Gloria Swanson in what amounts to ferocious self-parody).The screenplay was written by Don Ingalls, and Jack Smight was the director.

It's dependable, and goes on. Fashions come and go, and wars, and social problems, economic crises, political climates. Baseball outlives them allin our midst. A steady constant that retains its own slow unfolding patterns, while convulsions grip the land outside and tear out the old to plant in the new. Baseball serenely glides bypermanent, beautiful, ever itself: insular, yet mildly reflecting, in a peaceful way, in its own terms, the changes going on outside. The world's cataclysms come about, and subside. But every summer is played the same eternal baseball game. We can time our lives, to its peaceful eternity. We can trust to its repose, and security.

us,The Screen: Neame's 'Odessa File':Thriller About Secret SS Society Opens,"When a thriller is built entirely around one star, you know that he's not going to vanish, that he simply can't get bumped offhence the suspense sags. And that's one of the many flaws in Ronald Neame's ""The Odessa File,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State, Loews Orpheum, and Cinema 2. The movie is so dependent on Jon Voight's presence that he's hardly allowed off the screen. So the threats to his life are no more exciting than watching a shopper being elbowed at a January white sale.The pictureset in Germany in 1963, and based on Frederick Forsyth's novelis concerned with a secret society of former SS men. Equipped with new identities, they're conspiring to produce rockets that will destroy Israel. Mr. Voight, a German journalist obsessed with tracking down a sadistic war criminal, finally infiltrates the organization by masquerading as an alumnus of the SS. (He's asked if he's willing to risk his life to crack the case. Whenever that demand is made of a reporter in a movie, I picture trouble at the story conference.) Naturally, the villains are eager to erase himunlike the audience, they don't know that he's unkillable, or that every trap set for him has to fizzle.The film makes its points methodically, almost academically. It also drags because there are many unnecessary transitional passages, devoted to moving the characters from one situation to another. Almost every occurrence is predictable. But at least there are no cabaret scenes; these Nazis don't have as much fun as those in ""The Night Porter.""Mr. Voight is not at his besthe's just too thoughtful a performer for a mere action part, which offers too little scope for the variety of his talents. He hasn't much to do beyond conveying worry, weariness and patience; he's rarely allowed to smileand it's a deprivation not to see this actor smile. He's quite skillful at impersonating a 40-year-old Nazibut throughout, his German accent comes out Chermann.Maximilian Schell does transcend the banality of the script; he's very good indeed as the dexterous survivor who was once the concentration camp butcher. Mary Tamm, as Mr. Voight's girl-friend, is colorless in a colorless part; almost her only function is to chide him for living dangerously. Meanwhile, moviegoers who crave dazzling suspense should see Claude Pintoteau's ""Escape to Nowhere"" instead of ""The Odessa File.""",1974-10-19T05:00:00+0000

It also authorizes the courts to punish officials if they did not comply. The bill, however, exempts foreignpolicy and nationaldefense information that has been classified secret by Executive order. One of the 17 new amendments to the bill would enable a petitioner now to ask that a Federal judge privately review classified information being sought and rule on whether it should in fact be classified or be made public. In vetoing the legislation that was passed overwhelmingly by Congress, but opposed by nearly all Government departments and agencies, President Ford said that he objected to the courts being permitted to make the initial classification decision in sensitive and complex areas where they have no expertise.",1974-10-20T05:00:00+0000

We are beginning to suspect that to fulfill a hope is to defeat it, and to make a dream come true is to turn it into a nightmare. For a moment, it seemed to us that we had arrived, that we had solved all material problems and could sit back and enjoy an eternal Sabbath. But we are discovering that the more triumphant our techology the less does society function automatically. In a time of widespread automation nothing happens automatically. You have to push and pull, threaten and beg if you want anything done. By mastering matter we have drained material factors of their potency to shape events. Look what has happened to money! Money cannot induce people to work harder or longer hours. Money cannot cure chronic poverty. Money cannot buy personal security.

""Sindbad"" is playing today and tomorrow at noon and midnight at the First Avenue Screening Room.The movie explores an aging rou's memories and reveries about the women he was involved with, circa 1900. In some cases, he revisits them in personin others, in his fantasies. His old flames are grateful or reproachful or nostalgic or indignant, according to characterizations that are left deliberately vague. Two themes concur: the rueful man alternates between admiring and loathing himself, until his lack of self-respect overrides the impulse of self-congratulation; also, he confesses that ""women were always good"" to him just because he never pretended that he loved themalthough he occasionally scatters that message around. Throughout, there's the consciousness of death: he clings to the past because he senses the brevity of the present.The atmosphere of this movie may sound banalbut it isn't, because of the extraordinary (and very beautiful) images that pour over the screen, intensified by rapid cuts. Sap leaking from bark gives way to the faces of those remembered; a piece of raw cauliflower evokes a split lip; a red shawl stiff with ice, dragged from a river, is then seen on the shoulders of the person who drowned herself. There's a marvelous scene in a restaurant where the privileged Sindbad luxuriates in a fine meal while he both stimulates and discourages the waiter in describing his private life  a conversation that results in the discovery that both were once married to the same young woman.Actually, this movie treats food more seductively than most I've seen; perhaps intentionally, eating comes through more pungently than sex. All in all, the visual enchantments of the film outweigh the very old-fashioned romanticismwhich isn't exactly what one expects from Hungary.",1974-10-25T05:00:00+0000

We asked Mr. Carter's editor at Viking, Linda Yablonsky, what started him writing the book, and she informed us that it was that corny remark, uttered by friends, that Your life would make a good movie. Miss Yablonsky heard about the partially completed MS. from a friend of Mr. Carter's She read the 250 or so pages of typescript at a sitting and a contract for the book quickly followedthis was in January, 1972. Typing in his cell, Mr. Carter rewrote the book six times, with Miss Yablonsky working closely with himvisiting him every two weeks and spending all day. She found Mr. Carter an easy author to work with, almost too deferential in accepting criticisms. The only previous writing he had done was short story in an anthology of prisoners' writings. Asked if Rubin Carter seemed bitter man, Miss Yablonsky said no; despairing would be more like it.

There is something irresistible in the honk of common speech, as Eliot no doubt guessed when he planned to title his aristophanic melodrama Wanna Go Home, Baby? That he later called it Sweeney Agonistes is more an example of caution than pedantry, for after all, it's easy to be misunderstood, or suspected of triviality, if you use slang. One of De Vries's earliest pieces was an excursion into Eliot, an essay called Thurber: The Comic Prufrock (the compliment of a thoughtful essay has been extended to De Vries himself, but only in England, where his mastery of slang has been justly recognized as a mature effort to rephrase our anxieties).

He found that type blocks made of the metal pantalonium could burn an imprint into specially treated paper, obviating the need for ribbons and cutting manufacturing costs by 8 per cent. The following spring, a mysterious epidemic arose throughout the country, characterized by shortness of breath, chest pains, insomnia, dizziness, and, in seven to 10 days, pulmonary failure and death. Amid the chaos, epidemiologistsmedical sleuths who trace the origin of disease outbreaksquickly found that the victims were all typists, secretaries, journalists and others who had used the new typewriters. Investigating the chemistry of the typing process, they discovered that each time a letter was seared onto paper, traces of a volatile petrochemical were released into air. Tests demonstrated that this chemical caused irreversible lung changes in laboratory animals after a lag time of several weeks, and in humans after several months. A national furor ensued, during which the officers of the typewriter company went to jail and the inventor himself was kept in protective seclusion. After a trial that dragged on for two years, the officers were all acquitted: No laws could be found regilating nonconsumable chemicals.",1974-10-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen.'Monster From Hell' and 'Vampire Hunter':Both Are Foolish but Respectable Fun,"""Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell"" and ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter,"" the new double bill from the Hammer horror-film factory in England, presents something of a problem. Anyone with a grain of sense shouldn't care less about them, but anyone who has a grain of sense as well as a fondness for horror films, especially the expensive-looking, mostly deadpan Hammer kind, can't afford to miss them.The two movies, which opened yesterday at the Liberty Theater and other houses around town, are foolish but fun in quite respectable ways.Of the two, ""Captain Kronos"" is easily the more foolish, and the more elaborately produced. The film introduces into movie vampire lore a superman of fine Nordic good looks, a slight German accent and a vow to go wherever evil is to be fought. To those of us of the World War II generation, a superman like Kronos (Horst Janson) is possibly a scarier concept than plain old blood-sucking, which may be beside the point to people who have doted on the comic-strip exploits of Captain Marvel and Clark Kent.I have a personal preference for conventional vampire movies in which every vampire shrinks before the sign of the cross, goes invisible in mirrors and can be efficiently dispatched with a stake through the heart. In this film, written and directed by Brian Clemens, there are, to quote the screenplay, as many varieties of vampire as beasts of prey. It takes all of Kronos's energies before he finally traps the fiends who have been ravaging a magnificent English country-side, stripping pretty little girls of their youth and leaving them in heaps of wrinkled flesh, washed up, at 15 or 16. The acting is terrible.Good old Peter Cushing, his hair blonder and more spit-curled than ever, shows up once again as the visionary doctor, the 19th-century father of body-part transplants, in ""Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell."" The setting is a hospital for the criminally insane run by Baron Frankenstein, who persists in trying to put people together in eccentric combinations God never intended.The Baron has learned a few things since the last time I saw him in the fastidious dress and manner of Mr. Cushing. There's now a good deal of dialogue about a patient whose head is rejecting the brain newly placed in it.Late in the story the Baron suggests, with a marvelously woeful sigh, that perhaps his career's ups and downs are the result of his always having relied too much on surgery and not enough on biochemistry.The film, written by John Elder and directed by Terence Fisher, is not without its intentional giggles. Compared with ""Andy Warhol's Frankenstein,"" however, it is very straight and solemn, chock full of the old horror film values we don't see much of any more.",1974-10-31T05:00:00+0000
