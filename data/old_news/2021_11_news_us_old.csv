Now, he has another restaurant ready to make its debut next door. Called Four, its in a historic Victorian cottage. (The two restaurants connect by a glass-covered pavilion that functions as an expanded dining room for 2 Spring.) Four has just 10 upholstered seats at a marble counter surrounding a demonstration kitchen done in simple Scandinavian style with blond wood set within the cottages white brick and siding. A painting of Anthony Bourdain is a centerpiece on one wall, and a huge Bonnet range equipped with a Japanese charcoal grill helms the kitchen. There, Mr. Schenker will be onstage so to speak, preparing and serving a 10- to 12-course tasting menu, $245, for one of the more elevated dining experiences available on Long Island. Mr. Schenker said he missed the ad hoc menus he used to prepare on Mondays at Recette. I am thrilled for the opportunity to cook in a similar intimate style for my guests, he said. Among the dishes hes planning are an oyster tartlet, langoustine with Champagne essence, rigatoni with giant clam and chiles, foie gras with a duck fat croissant, Mishima Wagyu with wasabi and onion, and chocolate pot de crme. Mr. Schenkers attention to detail will extend beyond the food and the list for 500 wines (from an underground cellar) to the tableware, with no pieces repeated throughout the dinner.

Our species, Homo sapiens, has existed for at least 200,000 years, but we have next to no idea what was happening for the majority of that time. In northern Spain, for instance, at the cave of Altamira, paintings and engravings were created over a period of at least 10,000 years, between around 25,000 and 15,000 B.C. Presumably, a lot of dramatic events occurred during that period. We have no way of knowing what most of them were. This is of little consequence to most people, since most people rarely think about the broad sweep of human history anyway. They dont have much reason to. Insofar as the question comes up at all, its usually when reflecting on why the world seems to be in such a mess and why human beings so often treat each other badly  the reasons for war, greed, exploitation and indifference to others suffering.

The greenish-gold oil  mostly from Kypriaki olives, an indigenous variety, with some koroneiki and arbequina  has a grassy aroma and warm richness finishing with a touch of bitterness. It complies with the international regulations for extra virgin and is now available in the United States.

Just before the pandemic, de Jong installed an elevator to ease her climb to the attic, where she keeps a painting studio tucked under the eaves. Going up and down in that lift  a little prison, she says  got her thinking about the tension between movement and confinement, a theme already on her mind as she watched the news, horrified by the unfolding refugee crises in Idlib, Syria, and the Mediterranean. Its a testament to de Jongs eclectic sensibility that she braided those thoughts together in a new body of work: Border-Line, a series of oil-stick paintings that mash up news imagery of the global migrant crisis  the rescue boat Sea Watch 4, huddled masses on rafts, fire at the Mria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos  with the kind of monstrous, cartoonish figures that frequently appear on her canvases. Here, they are ghostly lugs, hovering at the edge of the action, sometimes encased in little elevatorlike boxes (that de Jong made these paintings during Covid lockdown  very much in confinement  adds another layer). The series reflects her personal desire to do something about the migrant situation, but these ungainly interlopers seem to sound a note of self-critique: Like the artist and her presumed viewer, they empathize and gawk in equal measure.",2021-11-08T22:10:35+0000

My notes from the meeting simply say, NIKOLE: special issue on the 400th anniversary of African slaves coming to U.S., a milestone that was approaching that August. This wasnt the first time Nikole had brought up 1619. As an investigative journalist who often focuses on racial inequalities in education, Nikole has frequently turned to history to explain the present. Sometimes, reading a draft of one of her articles, Id ask if she might include even more history, to which she would remark that if I gave her more space, she would be happy to take it all the way back to 1619. This was a running joke, but it was also a reflection of how Nikole had been cultivating the idea for what became the 1619 Project for many years. Following that January meeting, she led an editorial process that over the next six months developed the idea into a special issue of the magazine, a special section of the newspaper and a multiepisode podcast series. Next week we are publishing a book that expands on the magazine issue and represents the fullest expression of her idea to date. ",2021-11-09T10:00:26+0000

Growing up in Hawaii, Texas and Maryland, I ate rice three times a day: with fish for breakfast; with Spam and nori for lunch; with hamburger or more fish or tofu for dinner. In my childhood, Thanksgiving turkey was served not with mashed potatoes but rice; steak not with frites but rice; scrambled eggs not with toast but rice. (It wasnt until I went to college on the East Coast that I finally experienced classic American dishes accompanied by their traditional starches.) And it was always the same kind: white, short-grain Japanese rice, polished and glossy, pleasantly clumpy and quick to yield between the teeth, clinging to the chopstick, sticking to the spoon. In adulthood, when rice became a kind of decadence, sacrificed in adherence to a supposedly healthier, definitely less satisfying low-carb diet, the mere scent of it made me wistful  how much easier life seemed before rice became so complicated.",2021-11-11T10:00:16+0000

Maybe you tuck a towel around the rim for a tighter seal to catch drips of condensation; maybe you flick the flame up high, lean in to hear the last rustle of water boiling off, then shut down the burner and let the pot be, sitting there ticking in the fading heat. You have to rely on your sense of smell to recognize when the gorgeous scent of roasting is near its peak  when it hits that note of popcorn just bursting to life, kernels turning themselves inside out, or of hot chestnuts from street carts in winter, tossed in woks with tiny black stones and shucked of their sleeves  to save it before it ends in bitterness.

Thiof, a white grouper, is such common Senegalese restaurant fare that the Wolof word itself is slang  a handsome man is also a thiof, a good catch. Id eaten beachside thiof south of Dakar in the vacation area of Saly, and cliffside thiof at breezy restaurants in Les Almadies, the Dakar neighborhood known for its nightlife. This thiof, though rubbed with spices like the others  I tasted ginger, garlic, cardamom, maybe turmeric  was served with a tiny cup of warm tamarind glaze. If there were vegetables on the plate, I have banished them from my memory; only the sauce, fish and rice were in conversation. The skin of the thiof was crisp and juicy, the sauce tangy and rich. The rice was not as long as basmati, nor as short as sticky rice, but a size in between, round through the middle with little adhesion and a firm but pliant texture. If food encapsulates pleasure, innovation and community all at once, then tasting the Platonic ideal of a simple dish can bring a place and its people into focus, even if you encounter that ideal in an unlikely setting  a lighthouse restaurant known for its brunch.",2021-11-11T10:00:24+0000

The doll reached forward, porcelain lips parted, as if to touch the artist on the other side of the glass. Equipped with a miniature phonograph in place of a heart, the antique toy once emitted nursery rhymes. Back then, to see and experience a talking doll must have been just completely uncanny and frightening, says Kurant. Its impossible, she says, for us to grasp how shocking the spectacle would have been for 19th-century consumers, now that the breakneck pace of technological discovery has numbed us to even the most startling innovations.

Stranded along the Place Charles de Gaulle, she noticed the intricate motifs on the wrought-iron chains encircling the perimeter of the monument. The ornamental links inspired her to create a new coat of arms, this one with two nested Cs facing in opposite directions.

Due to the nature of our problems, to a very deep-rooted tradition, to the fact that we have a platform and a way to make ourselves heard, this is, also, someone from whom an active contribution is expected in solving problems. Elsewhere, he has written that literature does not describe countries, it invents them, and as one of the key figures of the Boom, the explosion of Latin American writing onto the world stage during the 1960s, he has helped to shape a sense of identity that transcends national borders. Among the things I learned from literature, he explained in a speech in Madrid in 2012, was to feel Latin American, to discover that, in Peru, I was only a small part of a community that had very large common denominators, not just language, but also history and social, political problems.",2021-11-23T10:00:06+0000

You might see people, as they grow older, they start to bend over, with the spine collapsing, and theyre staring at the ground while theyre walking  they cant stand upright anymore, Murphy says. Plant your feet about hip distance apart; the weight on each foot should feel the same. Establish equilibrium by spreading the pinkie toe as far away from the big toe as possible. You can feel how weight might shift a little bit from the inside of your foot, to the outside, the front to the back, says Murphy, who considers standing pose to be central in most of the classes he teaches. Next, bring your feet together so your big toes and heels touch. This action forces your muscles to engage in balancing you.",2021-11-23T10:00:11+0000

I read one in the morning and one in the afternoon, five days a week, for the better part of a year, and they were mostly lousy as hell.

When the chemistry was miniaturized and put on a silicon chip, reading DNA became fast, cheap and widespread.

In one moment the adolescent heroes are brandishing a 1989 Billy Ripken Fleer card; in the next theyre navigating the Cabbage Patch Kids craze, which happened in 1983. Its as if a decades blurry reminiscence has been flattened into an indefinite, sentimental mush.",2021-11-24T15:02:19+0000

In 1947, after so many years of wandering, Dior writes in his 1956 autobiography, couture was weary of only catering [to] painters and poets, and wanted to revert to its true function, of clothing women and enhancing their beauty. The clothes he designed, as he puts it, were for flowerlike women, with rounded shoulders, full feminine busts and hand-span waists. Among the silhouettes in his debut Corolle line (named after the botanical term for flower petals), one in particular stood out: the Bar Jacket. Constructed in cream silk shantung, the veste was sculpted to fit snugly above a narrow waist, then flare into a scalloped basque, which was meticulously padded, stiffened and weighted to accentuate the hipline. Paired with a very full skirt, it was dubbed the New Look by the press  and set off a sartorial revolution.",2021-11-25T13:00:07+0000
