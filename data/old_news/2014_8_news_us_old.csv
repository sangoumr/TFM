The sword is placed in our hands by force. I hope that, if at the last moment my efforts to bring about an understanding between ourselves and our adversaries and to maintain the peace do not succeed, we may, by the help of God, so use our swords that when all is ended we can replace them in their scabbards with honor.

But you could be forgiven for thinking his title also describes the publishing industry. With the books debut this week at No. 10, there are now three Clinton-related volumes on the hardcover nonfiction list; Halper joins Edward Klein, whose Blood Feud is No. 3 after five weeks, and Hillary Clinton herself, whose Hard Choices is No. 5 after seven weeks. This state of affairs is nothing new. By my count, the Clintons have featured in more than 60 best sellers since entering the national stage in 1992. And they retain a close interest in whats written about them, according to Halper. While I was still reporting on my book, he told Politico last month, James Carvilles office called, seemingly out of the blue, to grill me on whom Id already spoken to. I obviously refused to indulge the questioner. Halper also said that Clintons publisher had reached out to his publisher for information about the book, and that Clintonites were scrambling to identify his unnamed sources. Ive found the task of covering the Clintons fascinating, he said. Theyre not exactly the people we see on television. They may, however, be the people we see in literature  Halper sets his tone by opening Clinton, Inc. with a damning line from The Great Gatsby: They were careless people, Tom and Daisy  they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into . . . whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.",2014-08-01T14:49:49+0000

To replicate the swinging, circular moves, you and your partner maneuver an icon along arcing, ever-shifting pathways, inevitably getting tangled. If we cant put down our phones, Bounden exploits that isolating tendency to bring us closer  physically, at least. Its fun, especially at early levels, where good dancing isnt the point. As the game advances, it becomes trickier, monitoring your accuracy and flashing Hurry up! if you fall behind the music, like a good-natured ballet master. Videos, featuring dancers from Dutch National Ballets junior company, offer something to aspire to. (gameovenstudios.com.) ",2014-08-01T16:00:06+0000

Twenty-five years after Russian troops invaded East Prussia and German troops crossed the Belgian frontier, this anniversary has now completed the full cycle of change from a symbol of defeat to a harbinger of eventual German triumph. By Chancellor Hitlers personal command, tomorrow will be a holiday for the entire German Army  the largest and strongest in German history. Every garrison in the Third Reich will hold special exercises to mark the beginning of four years of war which ended in defeat for Germany. This paradox is elaborated  if not explained  in columns of historical comment which fill the German press today. The grim situation in Europe this summer is explained in this official history as a parallel to that of 1914 only in its external form. The difference between 1914 and 1939 is summed up in most German newspapers by the black headlines August, 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm  August, 1939, Adolf Hitler.

A group calling itselfSpace PAC,in promoting Mr. Rothblatts campaign, has raised $225,000, all of it from Martine Rothblatt. The Times says, family-financed super PACs are only the latest and most outrageous examples of how super PACs are used in this campaign cycle to evade the limits on donations.

Mr. Tyner said he was not seeking a new election but a declaration by the state Republican executive committee that Mr. McDaniel was the winner, and he asked for a hearing within eight days. Mr. Cochran won the runoff by roughly 7,700 votes, a victory that was helped by turning out black voters who rarely participate in Republican primaries. Mr. Tyner said the McDaniel campaigns research would show that Mr. McDaniel had won by 25,000 votes. ",2014-08-05T01:27:13+0000

How should governments regulate the production and sale of the drug? A functional regulatory system has to limit the increase in drug abuse that is likely to accompany lower prices and greater availability in a post-legalization America. First, lawmakers must institute a viable method of taxation  policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot. Second, distributors must not be permitted to market to minors: Controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people, banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with the state attorney general in 1998. And finally, streams of cultivation and retail should be segregated  to avoid a similar system of juggernauts that dominates the tobacco industry. Ultimately, whatever states decide to do, it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve.",2014-08-05T10:37:07+0000

We look really good tonight, Charlotte tells Alice. Im sure were going to get in. Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times: Humorously and fondly, with an entertaining supply of what he has called prosaic license, Mr. Stillman again displays a pitch-perfect ear for both the cattiness and the camaraderie that bind his characters into collective friendship. Weaving together the disco backdrop (clearly a labor of love) with more sharp-edged material about college graduates finding their first footing in New York and learning to cook with Campbells mushroom soup, he creates a bright panorama of shrewd young strivers.",2014-08-07T05:00:03+0000

The possibility of a peace plan appears ever more remote: There seems to be little room left in Israeli politics for those who would end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and create an independent Palestinian state.

(Starz) AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013) Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), a con man with a rococo comb-over, and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), his seductive mistress, are forced by an F.B.I. agent (Bradley Cooper, above right, with Ms. Adams and Mr. Bale) to help ensnare politicians in this screwball comedy directed by David O. Russell and inspired by the Abscam sting operation begun in 1978, which netted corrupt elected officials but also resulted in charges of entrapment. Jennifer Lawrence plays Irvings adenoidal stay-at-home wife; Jeremy Renner is the mayor of Camden, N.J., whose ambitions trump his decency. Mr. Bale has long been a great actor, if not an especially likable screen presence, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Its a pleasure to see him warm up, soften up, not only because he looks as if he were having a good time, but also because hes extraordinary here. The film giddily embraces the excesses of its era, from spandex to staches, though its a farce that speaks as well to this tarnished age, she added. But all the shiny surfaces, the glitter ball and the gaudiness, also suggest a world in which everyone is anxious to shake off the post-Vietnam War, post-Watergate funk. The ghost of Richard M. Nixon hovers in the air; everyone is a fake, and everyone wears a mask. ",2014-08-08T05:00:04+0000

The clear, concise way in which Mr. Edison explained many subjects which had not been understood after two weeks of evidence from numerous witnesses would have convinced anyone who did not know his reputation that his knowledge of electricity was at once comprehensive and accurate. All listened to his testimony with the greatest interest, and when he had finished felt that their knowledge of electricity had been greatly increased.

Well, we have plans; hes expecting us, I amended lamely. My son burst into tears, and no matter how I tried to spin it, he was adamant. Maybe he was tired; maybe the dark, cloudy morning visible from our windows was too uninviting.

Michael Muller, a photographer, used waterproof strobe lights he designed himself and a boat dragging a seal decoy to get a rare photo of a shark breaching at night. Muller, who traveled to False Bay, South Africa, to photograph sharks for a book coming out in 2015 from Taschen, said waiting for a shark in the dark is an intense experience.

Too bad, since Moriarty turns out to be a natural blogger, droll and daffy and confiding. Here she is, for instance, on reading Fifty Shades of Grey: Why didnt any of you lovely readers tell me that you wanted more spanking? (Ha.) . . . Maybe you realized that I couldnt write a sexy spanking scene to save my life. (Well, I dont know. Perhaps I could to save my life. Except Id be quite nervous and distracted by the person trying to kill me.) Moriarty does maintain an active presence on Facebook, where, to promote her latest novel, Big Little Lies  new at No. 1 on the hardcover fiction list  she recently asked readers to reveal little lies of their own. My publishers asked me to get in the spirit of things by also making a confession, she wrote, so heres one: When my sons kindergarten class was putting together a recipe book of favorite easy recipes I sent in a nutritious-sounding avocado muffin recipe that I had never made in my life just so I would look like a good mother.",2014-08-08T15:16:21+0000

This is Lena Finkle, and Ulinich renders her in a naturalistic style, with sophisticated use of perspective, shadowing and ink-wash technique.

Mulhouse has been occupied, and French cavalry is pursuing the fleeing Germans further to the north. The occupation of Mulhouse followed upon that of Altkirch, reported earlier in the day. The entrance of the French troops into Alsace is a historic event, which will arouse the enthusiasm of the whole French nation. The advance guard of the French army reached Altkirch at nightfall on Friday. The town was defended by very strong field works and was occupied by a German brigade. The French advance guard also consisted of a brigade. The French troops dashed to the assault with magnificent ardor. An infantry regiment, in a furious bayonet charge, carried the German trenches after a hot engagement in front of the lines. Once again the bayonet charges put the Germans to flight.

Kopplemann, former Congressman for three terms from Connecticut and member of the large American delegation to the meeting in Switzerland. Outside influences have been creating discords which are unfortunate and unfair to both Arab and Jew in Palestine. We are far from satisfied with the British White Paper, which nullifies the Balfour Declaration, but we are going to do the best in our power to settle the controversy  particularly unfortunate at this time of racial discrimination  in a fair and peaceful way, said Mr. Kopplemann. Mr. Kopplemann is one of the members of the American delegation which is meeting in Paris before the start of the congress to act as a steering committee for the delegation as a whole, which numbers some thirty-two persons. We Americans feel that we have done a major part of the work of building up the wastelands and draining the swamps of Palestine, making that land, in fact, one of the most productive parts of the world. We have raised the standard of living there, not only of the Jew but also of the Arab. We feel that the American delegation should therefore participate in the congress to the fullest degree.

The strafing attack was made against the northwestern village of Polis, but it was believed to have been launched in error by pilots who had not yet received their cease-fire orders from Ankara. Throughout the rest of the island, the situation eased somewhat when it was learned that Turkish troops had not invaded the island as alleged last night by the Greek Cypriot government. The government had charged that four Turkish destroyers were unloading men and material at Kokkina, the last major stronghold of the Turkish Cypriots on the northwestern coast. But the UN found no evidence to support the allegation. Col. Johnas Waern, commander of the UN Swedish contingent on Cyprus, inspected the area and reported seeing only a very small ship offshore which was not unloading anything. There was a brief flareup of shooting in Nicosia tonight, but there were no reports of any casualties. Firing also continued sporadically throughout the day between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the Kokkina area, according to reliable reports reaching Nicosia tonight.

And Pauline Burlet is Maries older daughter, who finds the situation nearly intolerable. The narrative complications can be distracting, at times exasperating, but theyre finally irrelevant because Mr. Farhadis filmmaking is so fluid, and the performers, Ms. Bejo, in particular, are so attractive, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

Under the measure, any violation would be considered a crime, punishable by fines. Exceptions were made for surgery urgently required for a patients health. Ayatollah Khamenei expressed alarm last winter about the conspicuous decline in births in Iran, saying he was shaking with fear about demographic trends that could reduce population growth to zero. The number of children per couple has fallen to 1.3 from a peak of 3.6 in the years after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

On Tuesday, Mr. Modi visited the town of Kargil, near the Line of Control, to inaugurate a power plant. Top civilian officials have rarely visited Kargil since the conflict there, in which India lost more than 500 soldiers. Estimates of Pakistans losses vary, but are believed to be higher. After being elected in May, Mr. Modi took a relatively warm tone toward Pakistan, inviting its prime minister to attend his swearing-in and leaving the impression that the two nuclear-armed neighbors were prepared for a period of calm. Since then, however, cease-fire violations on the Line of Control have become more frequent. ",2014-08-13T03:30:09+0000

But it doesnt take a federal investigation to understand the history of racial segregation, economic inequality and overbearing law enforcement that produced so much of the tension now evident on the streets. St. Louis, the editorial says, has long been one of the nations most segregated metropolitan areas, with whites dominating the City Council and police department. For decades whites used zoning laws to keep blacks out of desirable areas; among black residents within the city, poverty and unrest grew. The black population has also been subjected to intervention from the largely white police force far out of proportion to their population, according to the editorial. The circumstances of Mr. Browns death are, inevitably, in dispute, says the editorial, but what is not in dispute is the sense of permanent grievance held by many residents and shared in segregated urban areas around the country. Mr. Browns death serves as a reminder of a toxic racial legacy that still infects cities and suburbs across America.",2014-08-13T10:40:44+0000

us,"A Betrayed Wife, Clinging to Hope","Like so many spectacularly successful comic playwrights from the first half of the 20th century, George Kelly (the uncle of Grace) is mostly forgotten. The interest that he does occasionally draw from contemporary producers is for his early satires. In 2000 Dylan Baker directed a droll and flamboyant production of The Torch-Bearers, Kellys 1922 sendup of community theater, which featured a memorably bravura performance by Marian Seldes. The Show-Off, which Kelly wrote two years later, is also periodically remounted. But the Mint Theater is not content with producing an ignored writer. Drawn to obscurity like a certain kind of obsessed indie music fan, it searches out the ignored works of ignored writers. So this month, the Mint mounts a rare production of one of Kellys later plays, The Fatal Weakness (1946), about a woman in a 28-year marriage who discovers that her husband is having an affair. Her fatal weakness is that shes a hopeless romantic. (The Fatal Weakness starts previews on Tuesday at the Mint, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; minttheater.org, 866-811-4111.)",2014-08-13T22:07:09+0000

King after he was beaten by Los Angeles police in the 1990s, said that he expected to file a complaint this week, and that the circumstances surrounding the shooting in South Los Angeles remained unclear. Police officials have said that Mr. Ford tackled an officer who had stopped him and lunged for the officers gun, which was secured in his holster. The officers partner then shot Mr. Ford and the first officer reached for a backup weapon to shoot as well. Mr. Lerman said that the police could have easily used less lethal options on Mr. Ford, whose family said he had a mental illness. They could have used a Taser, they could have wrestled him to the ground, they did not have to shoot right away, Mr. Lerman said. Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a police spokesman, said that Mr. Ford had continued to walk as the police tried to stop him and tried to conceal his hands. Residents who said they witnessed the shooting told local news media that they had seen no sign that Mr. Ford put up a struggle. ",2014-08-15T02:17:58+0000

us,Morning Views,"After a night that startled the nation with images of police overkill, higher authorities wisely stepped into Ferguson, Missouri, says an editorial in The New York Times. The St. Louis suburb was rocked by an incident last Saturday, when a police officer shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old. Residents held protests since the shooting, and were countered by aggressive street policing by officers outfitted in war gear who too often veered toward provocation more than protection. The local authorities have refused to identify the police officer who shot the teenager. Residents have a right to know whether the officer has a record of reckless behavior, and whether the officer lives in the community. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said the protesters should be given the right to demonstrate, and that Ferguson would become known as a community that pulled together to overcome violence. Bringing back a sense of justice will not be easy in the town where the majority of residents are black while the leadership is white, the editorial says. The authorities are warranted in responding forcefully to violence, but the unyielding use of military tactics and abusive behavior have widened the gap between them and the towns residents. Once the tear gas has dissipated, Mr. Nixon and Mr. Obama have an obligation to ensure that a real dialogue begins in Ferguson and other racially segregated areas, in hopes of keeping armored vehicles off the streets of America.",2014-08-15T10:00:46+0000

It was bad enough to steal the picture, they argued, but to return it fixed up according to his own ideas was almost a sacrilege. Yet not one of them was prepared to argue that Serges criticism of the work before he altered it was wrong. They only doubted that he was the man for the job. Meanwhile, the picture lies in a safe in the Louvre and in the days to come it will be studied by a group of specialists. It may be, as some believe, that Serge has harmed it to some extent, or, as others believe, that he improved it. That will take time to determine, but the Louvre publicly admits the painting is still worth its $100,000 assessment value.

The crime is such that knowledge of it will cause a great deal of emotional trauma. It would be hard (and probably unconstitutional) to prosecute the perpetrator while keeping the details of his crimes private.

Duong Van Minh as chief of state and gave Premier Nguyen Khanh sweeping new powers by electing him to the newly created post of president. The council, meeting at this seaside resort about 40 miles east of Saigon, also promulgated a new national charter similar to a provisional constitution. This action clears the way for the establishment of an appointed provisional national assembly within one month. There has been no assembly or post of president since President Ngo Dinh Diem was overthrown last November. The council blocked Gen. Khanhs bid for a one-man rule during the previously declared state of emergency and insured that final authority would rest with the council as a whole. Gen. Khanh retains the position of council chairman and commander in chief of the armed forces. New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, August 17, 1964 ",2014-08-15T14:32:51+0000

And what tough-talking star  Ted Danson, perhaps?  would take on the role of the devious brother-in-law, Bob Spilman, who, by Macys account, snatched control of the family business away from the rightful heir, the aforementioned JBIII? And what of the books villain, Larry Moh, the Chinese bercapitalist seemingly bent on putting American furniture makers out of business?

(In addition to Colorados and Washingtons policies allowing recreational use, 35 states have legalized some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes.)

Edward James Olmos plays a drug lord with $3 million for the taking, Paula Patton is a Drug Enforcement Administration operative, Bill Paxton is a Central Intelligence agency whack job, and James Marsden and Fred Ward do business for the Navy. Working with an editor, Michael Tronick, who doesnt step on the sometimes wittily choreographed action by overcutting, Mr. Kormakur sets and keeps up a fast rather than frantic pace that never runs the movie off the rails even when the story nearly does, Ms. Dargis wrote. Much as he did in his last movie, Contraband, another thriller with Mr. Wahlberg, Mr. Kormakur has put his imprimatur on a pulp fiction that easily could have become another generic diversion instead of a fine genre one.",2014-08-16T05:00:03+0000

Although the Gallery trustees turned down the Windsor picture a week ago, they accepted Sassoons offer of another Sargent work, a portrait in oil of Sir Philip himself. Dr. John Rothenstein, director and keeper of the Tate Gallery, stoutly maintained today that the trustees decision was the result of consideration of the charcoal drawing purely on its merits as a work of art. He said it was not considered a good example of the artists work. Any suggestions that there was a prejudice against the personality or that there was an extraneous reason is entirely untrue, he said.

(Showtime 2) THE CANYONS (2013) This low-budget, famously trashy film was supposed to herald the return of Lindsay Lohan (above, with James Deen) to respectability, or at least bankability. It didnt. But it was interesting. Written by the novelist Brett Easton Ellis (Less Than Zero, American Psycho) and directed by Paul Schrader (who wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull and directed American Gigolo), the movie is a dark, half-incoherent story about sex, movies and meaninglessness in Los Angeles. Every so often, wrote Manohla Dargis in The New York Times, Mr. Schrader manages to deliver a jolt, an image, a line reading and even a scene  like a narratively decisive down-and-dirty sexual four-way  that fleetingly lifts The Canyons.

Using archival material and other sources, the experts ascertained that the Liebermann painting rightfully belonged to the descendants of the industrialist David Friedmann, they said in a statement on Sunday. The work is only the second of 458 disputed paintings, prints and drawings in the collection, known as the Munich Art Trove, that the panel of experts, convened by the German government, has determined was looted. The other, a Matisse, was found in June to have been stolen from the collector Paul Rosenberg. Yet the Matisse has not been returned to Mr. Rosenbergs heirs, and the Liebermann is sure to face a similar fate, because of the legal limbo surrounding Mr. Gurlitts collection following his death. Although Mr. Gurlitt, the son of an art dealer who worked for the Nazis, left his collection to the Kunstmuseum Bern, it has not yet decided whether to accept the gift. An agreement signed between Mr. Gurlitt and German authorities binds the new owner to restitute any looted works, but that cannot happen until the gift is accepted. David Toren, a great-nephew of Mr. Friedmanns who lives in New York, filed a lawsuit against the German government in hopes of speeding the return of his familys art work. This is a very important first step in returning the painting to its rightful owners and we hope that the German government will not further delay returning the painting, Mr. Torens attorney, August J. Matteis Jr., said in a statement.",2014-08-17T22:55:19+0000

Keeping long running tasks on the main thread will result in that perception, the dreaded Application Not Responding (ANR) and a bad user experience. This leaves us developers one choice: concurrent execution of code. The recent growth in popularity of functional programming is well deserved. As things become more asynchronous, the functional model really fits well. Being able to sequence, chain and transform asynchronous operations can be considered a must. However, the mechanisms for asynchronous programming provided in Android leave much to be desired, especially when compared to the web development realm. Many of the ideas and techniques from enterprise Java frameworks have not yet migrated to the Android world. Practices that some would consider table stakes for web development on the JVM have just begun to trickle in on Android; dependency management and a modern build system, for example.

But with the right colleagues in chamber music and the right conductor in concertos, reined in just a bit, Ms. Argerich is often incomparable.

Once there, Ms. Logan (above right, with Tai, a student) hoped to make a record of young lives changing for the better. Instead, she met Beth, a 15-year-old who was punished with beatings and stints in solitary confinement, and a gay teenager named David, whose parents arranged for his midnight abduction from his home in Colorado and his relocation to the school, where they hoped strict discipline and aggressive Christianity might change his sexual orientation. The resulting documentary is important, if imperfect, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Logan makes the young-filmmaker mistake of injecting herself into the story, he said.

(Starz) KILL YOUR DARLINGS (2013) A tale of the Beat movement in its larval stage, this film from John Krokidas pictures Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe), Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) and Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan, above with Mr. Radcliffe at left) as restless young intellectuals in 1940s New York City. (William S. Burroughs, less young but equally restless, is played by Ben Foster.) Ginsberg is the films protagonist and moral center, but the plot revolves around Carrs friendship with his former teacher, David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), which edged into obsession and ended with a fatal confrontation in Riverside Park. The film is at once a lurid true-crime chronicle and a coming-out story, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Its vision of the past is stereoscopic, affirming Allens erotic self-discovery even as it explores the shadows of the closet where he and his friends must dwell.

The Republican authorities took pains to stop this destruction. As Francos troops occupied the countrys territory, the authorities immediately organized a service for the protection and reassembling of works of art. These services, directed by Eugenio dOrs, now are engaged in checking losses and putting together the famous collections which have been dispersed.

I leave the kimchi out of my own (though I did make one unconventional filling with tofu, a sort of picadillo cooked and mashed in a salsa ranchera that proved to be irresistible) and stick to the Mexican seasonings I love: chiles and cilantro, cumin and chili powder and salsas. Vegetables were the focus of each filling, and all of this weeks tacos are vegetarian. I combined sweet corn and green beans in one, and roasted peppers, squash and potatoes seasoned with cumin and chile powder in another. I grabbed chard from my garden for a few of the fillings, and made use of this summers bounty of squash.I love the flavor of corn tortillas, and theyre a godsend for friends who have trouble with gluten. I buy them in packs of three dozen, then divide the packages so I can freeze them by the dozen because I usually dont use 36 tortillas in a week (though this week, I did). As for how much filling to count on for each taco, I follow Rick Baylesss advice and use about a quarter cup. As he says, tacos are as much about the tortilla as they are about the filling, and you wouldnt want to overwhelm the tortilla any more than youd want to overwhelm pasta with too much sauce.",2014-08-22T15:52:32+0000

Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey Beaumont, a dull American teenager who discovers a severed ear and sets out to find its owner. Along the way, he witnesses terrible and beautiful things  including Dennis Hopper, at his most unhinged, and Dean Stockwell, deranged and in pancake makeup, lip syncing Roy Orbisons In Dreams into a table lamp. Isabella Rossellini, above, smolders as the abused nightclub singer who becomes the object of Jeffreys desire. For those with the temerity to follow it anywhere, Blue Velvet is as fascinating as it is freakish, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. It confirms Mr. Lynchs stature as an innovator, a superb technician and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.",2014-08-23T05:00:04+0000

us,The Death of the One-Handed Backhand,"Back in January, when Stan Wawrinka won the Australian Open, it was the first time in more than four years that someone not named Federer, Nadal, Djokovic or Murray captured a grand-slam championship. This was heartening for tennis fans, who have grown tired of watching the so-called Big Four dominate the sport for the last decade. But for a small and perhaps dwindling set of tennis aesthetes, it was noteworthy for a less obvious reason. Wawrinka, a 29-year-old Swiss player, uses one of the prettiest strokes in tennis: a singular display of agility, balance and precision timing known as the one-handed backhand. It is far superior for slice, or underspin; it is also much better for drop shots and volleys and for retrieving difficult-to-reach balls. Good players can conjure exquisite angles with it.",2014-08-24T18:05:36+0000

Highlights include new commissions by Kyle Abraham, Michelle Dorrance, Liz Gerring and Sonya Tayeh. In honor of the 85th anniversary of Grahams Lamentation, each choreographer will contribute a work for Lamentation Variations, a series that began in 2007 and features pieces inspired by Grahams signature solo. The season also plans to feature works exemplifying Grahams collaborations with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. In addition to the Joyce season and a 20-city tour, the troupe is scheduling performances at various New York locations throughout the fall and winter. The Graham Deconstructed series, which takes audiences behind the scenes, begins with Peter Sparlings look at the 1953 piece Voyage (Sept. 16 and 17), followed by a company performance of Appalachian Spring (Oct. 30) to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its premiere; both will be at the Martha Graham Studio Theater in the West Village. The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology will host a performance on Oct. 28 in conjunction with its Dance and Fashion exhibition, which includes several Graham Company costumes. And from Dec. 10 through 13, Hauser & Wirth will host the dancers as part of that Chelsea gallerys Thomas Houseago exhibition. More information is at marthagraham.org.",2014-08-24T21:21:46+0000

The question of which currency an independent Scotland would use if Britain refused to share the pound again featured prominently, and Mr. Darling repeatedly challenged Mr. Salmond to reveal his Plan B. Mr. Salmond, who had been on the defensive on this point during the first debate, was better prepared this time. Refusing to be drawn in a debate over an alternative, he said that it was in the best interests of Scotland to continue to use the pound and that he wanted a mandate from the Scottish people to negotiate a currency union after a vote for independence.

(Flix) THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS (2002) In Jeff Stockwells screen adaptation of Chris Fuhrmans novel, directed by Peter Care, the teenage friends Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) cope with the anxieties of education, puberty and first love by writing a series of superhero comics. The masterstroke of this small, heartfelt directorial debut, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, is its integration of animated sequences (by Todd McFarlane) in which action-adventure caricatures of the comic book characters parallel or comment on events in the boys lives. Those lives are darkened as the film progresses, most affectingly by a story of familial abuse shared by Franciss new girlfriend, Margie Flynn (Jena Malone). Jodie Foster plays Sister Assumpta, an especially reviled teacher at the boys Roman Catholic school. Mr. Holden wrote: Ms. Foster, who seems to grow primmer with each film, locates the compassion beneath her characters grim, authoritarian surface. Like tiny ripples on a pond, her face registers the concerns of a caring surrogate parent committed to practicing an austere form of tough love.",2014-08-26T05:00:05+0000

Toward the end of July, we began talking to Paolo and Peter about going into Gaza and Israel, respectively, to make some pictures. We had noticed that during this summers outbreak of violence, the prevalence of cellphone cameras and social media led to many more images of Gaza than in previous iterations of this long-running conflict. This imagery made the cost of war visually appreciable in a way that it had not been even as recently as 2009. Yet as powerful as these photos were, the speed and fervor of their dissemination tended to bring them to us isolated from context.

This reissued recording, Duets of Love and Passion, originally released in 1964, presents the couple in scenes from Saint-Sans Samson et Dalila, Bizets Carmen and two Verdi operas, Otello and Aida. McCrackens muscular voice and intensity combine excitingly with Warfields dark colorings and warmth. Though Warfield, who died in 2009, had to accommodate her voice with some awkwardness to the subtle demands of Verdis Desdemona, a classic soprano role, she smolders as Verdis Amneris.

There was an air of expectancy in  when I reached it on Monday forenoon. News was scant and people were evidently becoming restless. Crowds were massed in the principal square watching the arrival from time to time of French soldiers with trophies captured from the enemy. Knots of men and women were gathered around villagers from the countryside and listening intently to vague accounts of fighting outside the city. About five oclock the atmosphere in the streets began to change. It seemed panicky. Rumors were afloat that the Germans were arriving; that the Prefect had given orders for all the flags to be hauled down; that the Prussian cavalry would enter the city at nine oclock! What these reports were worth at the time I do not know. But when, an hour or two later, I saw the officers in my hotel suddenly begin to pack their bags and pay their bills I considered it was time I prepared to move on, too, having no desire to be taken prisoner by the Germans. The tactics of the German cavalry is to appear here, there and everywhere, and the effect on the population is inevitable. We reached  at noon. We felt at once that the Germans were near. There was that unmistakable atmosphere. A general air of deadness, stagnation and stifled fear; suspense and anxiety on every face. Scant news has filtered through of the great battle between Mons and Charleroi. It is, of course, a secondary line which has wisely fallen back on a stronger line in order to cope better with the German cavalry movement on our left, a movement which must be watched.The New York Herald, European Edition, Aug. 30, 1914",2014-08-29T14:04:41+0000

Before I lost him to a heart attack, Ryan writes, whiskey had washed away some of the best parts of the man I knew. None of this, of course, means the book isnt full of your basic agitprop. Running a column about it last month, one Texas newspaper used the succinct headline Ryan Blames Everything on Left. So is this the first volley in a presidential campaign? Ryan has been noncommittal in interviews, saying hell wait until 2015 to decide. And despite the books calculated stagecraft and careful red-meat rhetoric (I believe the conservative vision can appeal to the majority of our fellow citizens), theres at least one good reason to think hes telling the truth: His whistle-stop book tour includes no scheduled appearances in Iowa or New Hampshire.",2014-08-29T14:50:09+0000

R. R. Tolkiens book. Martin Freeman (who plays Watson to Mr. Cumberbatchs Holmes on the television series Sherlock) once again portrays Bilbo, the hobbit who has been chosen to lead the fight for the reclamation. Mr. Jackson has taken roughly five chapters from the middle of Tolkiens book and turned them into a relentless adventure tale, teeming with rowdy action, slavering enemies and Elven gymnastics, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, noting the directors tendency to pile it on. Once again, she said, there are too many busy, uninterestingly staged battles that lean heavily on obvious, sometimes distracting digital sorcery.

Sixteen Negroes were accepted in four elementary schools here and by 10 a.m. this morning 14 were in first-grade classes. One of the two remaining Negroes was rejected when it was learned that the childs parents live outside the state. The other is to attend a school that starts classes later. The fact that there were no incidents today contrast sharply with the rioting that claimed two lives when Negro James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi at Oxford two years ago. White parents sat in their cars in the vicinity of the four Biloxi schools long after their children had entered, but there was no attempt to interfere when the Negro youngsters appeared and walked shyly, holding their parents hands, into the schools. The mother of one of the Negro pupils later told a reporter: Everything is OK, but it aint over yet. School desegregation also came peacefully today to Columbia, S.C., for the first time as six formerly white schools in Columbia enrolled 22 Negro students.

A Lost Chapter Is Found,"It appears that Roald Dahl, below, once planned for Charlie Bucket to have a lot more company and a somewhat wilder adventure in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. A lost chapter of an earlier version of this 1964 book that was found after Dahls death in 1990 was recently published for the first time in The Guardian. It reveals more temptations for a larger cast of characters and some variations on character names. The chapter opens with eight children  including Charlie, escorted by his mother instead of his Grandpa Joe  entering the Vanilla Fudge room. At this point, two other children, Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who later became Augustus Gloop, have already fallen into the chocolate river. Inside the room, the visitors see a mountain of chocolate where hundreds of workers (later called Oompa-Loompas) are chipping away chunks of fudge that are then loaded onto wagons and transported through a dark hole in the wall. Two children, Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice, disobey Willy Wonka and jump into the wagons. They are quickly swept away through the hole into the Pounding and Cutting Room. Wonka tells the parents that this room is where the fudge is pounded against the floor until it is all nice and smooth and thin. After that, he says, a whole lot of knives come down and go chop chop chop, cutting it up into neat little squares, ready for the shops. The chapter did not make the book because it was deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago, The Guardian said. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide in 55 languages, according to RoaldDahl.com, and has been made into two movies and a musical.",2014-08-31T21:27:29+0000
