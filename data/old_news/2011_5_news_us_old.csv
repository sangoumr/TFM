The Nielsen Company said that an average of 22.7 million viewers at home in the United States watched the wedding live (between 6 a.m. and 7:15 a.m. Eastern daylight time). That figure, encompassing viewers of 11 channels, reaffirmed pre-wedding polls that found only lukewarm interest in the nuptials among most Americans. Still, millions did tune in, leading to a record ratings day for some television channels. Between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m., when the wedding coverage was at its peak, CNN had an average of 1.66 million viewers, its biggest audience since the day after the presidential election in 2008. Between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. NBCs Today had an average of more than 9.6 million viewers, its biggest audience since the day after the presidential election in 2000. Good Morning America on ABC had an average of 8.65 million viewers, its biggest audience in at least 20 years. CBSs Early Show averaged 3.91 million viewers.

Two, Studio 60 was about comedy: specifically, late-night comedy and, presumably, Saturday Night Live. (Studio 60 was the name of a fictional, live, late-night sketch-comedy show produced out of Los Angeles.)

Its becoming a bit more common, and Princeton now pays for some kids to travel during their gap year, but most people are still wary of the idea. In fact, almost every kid Ive talked to who has taken a gap year raves about the idea, so I thought Id commission a guest column from my eldest son, Gregory, who is currently taking a gap year in China. He spent most of the year studying Chinese at Tsinghua University and then at a language school in Dalian, and soon hes going to finish up the year studying Spanish in Peru.

Knott will journey anywhere in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania where theres a dedicated electrical outlet and four clear feet of space for her folding table and portable Pasquini espresso machine. Along with filter coffee and espresso drinks  including a fantastic decaf  Knott offers loose-leaf black and herbal teas, hot chocolate (made with dairy, soy or coconut milk) and Italian sodas, all organic and fair-trade.

Since founding her business three and a half years ago, Knott has pulled shots and poured cups everywhere from suburban pool parties to the set of a slasher film on Governors Island. Her dedication to coffee  she wrote her thesis on it  is such that she even checks the water quality of an area before heading out. I actually prefer to bring my own, she says.

Commonwealth name-checks Enoch Powell (the Tom Tancredo of his day, or Thilo Sarazin, if you prefer a German reference), who had delivered his anti-immigrant Rivers of Blood speech the previous year. Commonwealth was Paul McCartneys mocking response. All of which shows that the sun never sets on some issues.

us,Asked & Answered | Pierre Thoretton,"In the past few years, there have been a number of documentaries about iconic fashion designers, from the critically acclaimed Valentino: The Last Emperor to the wayward Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston. But none seems as delicately composed and poignant as Pierre Thorettons LAmour Fou, which had its United States premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and will be out in theaters on May 13. Thoretton hangs the film on the spectacular $480 million art collection that the French-Algerian couturier Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berg, amassed during their 50 years together and its symbolism for the love they had for one another. Still its hard not to wonder if it was Berg, as much as Thoretton, who called the shots in the film much as he did in Saint Laurents life and image.

Seeing her perform in her Cub Scouts uniform at Pine Knob outside Detroit in the late 1970s (or early 80s; its a bit hazy) was a formative experience. With a few not-inconceivable twists of fate, its possible (at least to me) to imagine Brown as president and Ronstadt as first lady. That this didnt happen might have marked the moment when things started to go wrong. Or maybe that was when Johnny Carson retired.

Another $325 million is to go to the general endowment, and $125 million for future capital use. Named for a nearby spring, the museum has been designed by the architect Moshe Safdie as a series of pavilions nestled around two creek-fed ponds.

And because virtually all the important aesthetic, moral and political problems  the question of modernity itself and of modernist taste  are played out in photographys relatively brief history. William K. Ivins has called the camera the most important invention since the printing press. For the evolution of sensibility, the invention of the camera is perhaps even more important. It is, of course, the uses to which photography is put in our culture, in the consumer society, that make photography so interesting and so potent. In the Peoples Republic of China, people dont see photographically. The Chinese take pictures of each other and of famous sites and monuments, as we do. But theyre baffled by the foreigner who will rush to take a picture of an old, battered, peeling farmhouse door. They dont have our idea of the picturesque. They dont understand photography as a method of appropriating and transforming reality  in pieces  which denies the very existence of inappropriate or unworthy subject matter.

Jeremy Irons to Play King Arthur for One Night,"His sinister voice and unnerving gaze have guaranteed Jeremy Irons a career playing nefarious characters, but does he dream of playing a hero  even a once-great medieval king who is ditched by his wife for a newer and better model of knight? If so, Mr. Irons, a star of the Showtime series The Borgias (not to mention films like Reversal of Fortune and The Lion King) will get to fulfill that goal in a one-night concert production of Camelot for the Irish Repertory Theater, in which he will play King Arthur. Press representatives for the production, which will be presented on June 6 at the Shubert Theater, said on Friday that Mr. Irons will play Arthur, the Excalibur-wielding monarch, in the Lerner and Loewe musical.

(He is also co-owner of a soccer team.) He can soothe his resentments riding the seas on a 414-foot yacht, tended to by a full-time crew of more than 50. The yacht holds a basketball court, a movie theater and a fully equipped recording studio, complete with killer ocean views, that has allowed him to rub shoulders with the fabulous  Mick Jagger, Bono, Paul McCartney and a long list of Page Six names that populate this memoir. One of the greatest creative minds in the world of technology, writes Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seahawks and therefore an Allen employee, in a blurb gracing the books back cover.

Some families work the land out of necessity, while others seek the good life through labor and simplicity. In the 1840s, Thoreau took to the woods to live deliberately. During the Great Depression, self-sufficiency was raised to new importance, and well-educated men like the writer and editor Elliott Merrick and the economist Ralph Borsodi found homesteading a rational and intellectual pursuit. The political climate of the late 1960s (and later the energy crisis of the 70s) provoked back-to-the-land desires in many, including Eliot Coleman, who, inspired by Helen and Scott Nearings book Living the Good Life, moved in 1968 with his pregnant wife, Sue, to a remote 60-acre wood in coastal Maine. There, they developed sustainable, small-scale farming techniques that would help catalyze the organic movement. ",2011-05-06T16:52:16+0000

A judge ruled in Kays favor. Russell, who was not allowed to speak in his own defense, was denied his appointment at the college, which was, and is, part of the publicly financed City University of New York system. Today, the now-notorious incident is chronicled in an exhibition on City Colleges Web site, called The Struggle for Free Speech at CCNY, 1931-1942, as is a recounting of the subsequent firings, spurred by the McCarthy era Rapp-Coudert Committee, of faculty members accused of being Communist Party members.",2011-05-06T23:15:07+0000

Israel delayed the transfer of almost $90 million after the reconciliation last week between Fatah, the party that dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. Israel said it was suspending all such transfers until there were guarantees that none of the money would end up in the treasury of Hamas, which is sworn to Israels destruction. The Palestinian Authority has had financial difficulties since late last year and is running a monthly deficit of $30 million. The French government provided it with a special grant of $14.3 million on Monday. On Friday, the European Union said it would advance $121.9 million to help it meet its needs.

Some Hindus believe that the same spot is the birthplace of the god Ram, and that Babur had destroyed a Hindu shrine to build his mosque. In 1992, Hindu activists tore down the mosque, unleashing sectarian violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. In October a court ruled that the site should be split between the two religions, but the Supreme Court rejected that solution, calling it strange. The Supreme Court is expected to rule later on the question of how to resolve control of the site. ",2011-05-10T02:25:33+0000

Siegelman, and sent both mens cases back to Federal District Court for resentencing. A Department of Justice spokeswoman, Laura Sweeney, said the department was pleased with the courts decision. But Sam Heldman, an attorney for Mr. Siegelman, said the courts definition of bribery was open to interpretation by prosecutors, and many politicians and contributors could run afoul of it. It places everyones liberty at the mercy of mind readers, he said. ",2011-05-11T03:09:56+0000

The Environmental Assessment Commission of Coyhaique, a regional government commission in southern Chile, approved on Monday the $3.2 billion project, which involves a series of five dams in the sparsely populated region of Aysn, which is dotted with nature reserves. Government officials say the HidroAysn project is needed to help stave off an energy squeeze in Chile, which imports about 70 percent of its energy. Environmentalists say it will flood thousands of acres of largely undeveloped territory and damage ranching and tourism. The police arrested at least 60 people late Monday in Santiago at a downtown protest that attracted thousands. Hundreds of demonstrators also took to the streets in at least four other Chilean cities. Opponents, including some members of Chiles Congress, said Tuesday that they would appeal in court, while opposition legislators said they would request a congressional investigation into irregularities in the projects approval.

The Alaskan Palin fought corruption within her own party, attacked the nexus of government and big business, avoided polarizing feuds and cut successful bipartisan deals; in the process, Green notes, she succeeded to a remarkable extent in settling, at least for a time, what had seemed insoluble problems, in the process putting Alaska on a trajectory to financial well-being. This was the Palin that I liked from afar, before John McCain elevated her to national prominence: The charismatic pro-life working mom who was also a good-government reformer capable of thinking outside the ideological box. (Imagine Mitch Daniels crossed with Michelle Bachmann  in a good way.)

When Fred Krehbiel, a Chicago industrialist, decided to buy Ballyfin, a Georgian manor on 600 acres in Irelands County Laois, the property was being used as a school, he says, and we had to give them six years to build a new building. During that time, Krehbiels team of more than 100 workers began transforming the 1812 mansion into a hotel with 15 rooms, all while working around 500 teenagers. Krehbiel and crew restored ornate plasterwork, bought back some of the previous owners paintings, rebuilt the conservatory (which had to be disassembled and shipped to England for repairs) and even uncovered a Roman sarcophagus bathtub, now installed in one of the guest rooms. (Appropriately, a family motto of Ballyfins original owner, Sir Charles Coote, was cote que cote  cost what it may.)",2011-05-12T13:00:18+0000

When the Muslim man and about 20 other men arrived at the church where he believed she was being held, sectarian street battles erupted. Ms. Fakhri, who has done television interviews, said church authorities had detained her while they encouraged her not to convert. She said she called her Muslim boyfriend, who called the police, but when an officer called she was afraid to speak to him. Her account could not be confirmed. The Coptic Church forbids divorce, and reports of Coptic women converting to end a marriage are common. ",2011-05-13T02:14:19+0000
us,France: Terrorism Charges Dropped Against Iranian Group," The French authorities are dropping terrorism charges against 24 members of an Iranian dissident group for lack of evidence, court documents show, nearly eight years after a sensational raid on the organizations headquarters amid charges that the group was planning attacks in Europe. The police arrested 120 people in the raid on the offices of the group, the Peoples Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, which wants to overthrow the Iranian government, in a Paris suburb in 2003. Most were released, but 24 people were held on terrorism or terrorism-financing charges. The authorities said the organization had been plotting to attack Iranian embassies and assassinate former members working with Iranian intelligence services in Europe. In a ruling dated Wednesday, the investigating judges found that there were no grounds for proceeding with indictments for terrorism or terrorism financing. The groups lawyer, William Bourdon, said the judges based their decision partly on a legitimate right to resist tyranny, as well as the fact that there was no evidence that the group had ever been responsible for attacks on civilians. Nine members of the group remain under investigation for financial wrongdoing. ",2011-05-13T02:14:21+0000

(He was 20 when the group hit it big, thanks in part to the tendency of the British press to trumpet and acclaim.) Through lineup changes and side projects, and a recent foray in New York with his girlfriend, Alexa Chung, the MTV personality and Madewell designer, Mr. Turner has gravitated toward classic musicians, like Gene Clark of the Byrds, and films like the 1959 western Rio Bravo. His retro sensibility is evident on the bands fourth album, Suck It and See (Domino), to be released June 6. The title seems cheeky but its not, Mr. Turner said. Its an old Britishism, like a bit Dick van Dyke-y, like give it a try almost  itd be a slogan for some candy, he said. Thats not really traveled very well. In a conversation peppered with other Britishisms (nice one, love he said, often, alongside saucier phrases) he recently spoke with Melena Ryzik from Stockholm, where the band members were starting their tour, performing together for the first time in over a year. Im a bit nervous, to be honest with you, Mr. Turner said. I have just opened a beer, actually. Well see if thats going to help it out. I dont want to do too much of that. Im worried I might become forgetful, and theres a lot of words in our songs. Here are excerpts from their conversation. ",2011-05-13T18:57:56+0000

The decision to move to Baden-Baden follows a financial scandal that led to allegations of fraud against two former officials.

Thats because there isnt one. A board of trustees with every right to make a decision made it in a way that (a) ran counter to its previous practice (b) permitted a single member (Jeffrey Wiesenfeld) to derail a process that had seemed to be on a familiar track and (c) put CUNY right in the middle of the briar patch called the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Maladroit, unfortunate and (as I said) dumb. But thats it. It was just the board screwing up with the predictable public-relations disaster as the result. No ones freedom was curtailed, no ones speech was censored, no harm, except to the boards reputation and by extension to CUNYs, was done.Because Wiesenfelds objections were to Kushners views on Israel, the uproar that followed the boards decision to table his nomination quickly escalated into a shouting match between those who said that Israel was engaged in ethnic cleansing and those who replied that people who said that were anti-Semites and/or self-hating Jews. The responses to my column followed the same pattern. No one wanted to hear the topic of academic freedom parsed (a word used in derision by one reader, as if parsing something, trying to get it right, were a crime). MSP Shiloh complained that Dr. Fish misdirects our attention to the arcane and off topic of the academic honorary degree process, when [t]his was, and is, about Israels persecution of Palestinians. Other respondents were just as sure that this was, and is, about a university honoring a selfrighteous hack (mcghostoflectricity) who spews current day Palestinian propaganda (neilrobert). Both sides are wrong, not about Israel  I did not and will not come down on that issue  but about what this is about. Its about institutional ineptness, a relatively small matter that nevertheless can teach us some lessons. The back-and-forth trading of ritual insults is hardly edifying, but a proper understanding of what academic freedom is might be. ",2011-05-17T00:30:51+0000

Leading environmentalists said some farmers had cut down trees because they expected they would be allowed to do so anyway under a bill being considered in Brazils Congress to ease restrictions on the amount of land that needed to remain forested.

When the N.F.L. asked the players represented in the Brady suit to consent to the extension, they declined. The leagues motion asking for the extension is pending.

Mr. Cameron, whose 3-D Avatar, with almost $2.8 billion in ticket sales at the worldwide box office, is the highest-grossing film in history, will revise the record books when Titanic, the second-highest-grossing film of all time, with $1.8 billion in worldwide sales, returns to theaters in 3-D. Fox and Paramount joined Mr. Camerons Lightstorm Entertainment in announcing the re-release date on Thursday. The next frontier in 3-D may well involve not fantasies and cartoons but naturalistic dramas like Titanic (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, left). Steven Soderbergh, for instance, had planned to shoot his coming Contagion, a disease drama, in 3-D, but backed off when he couldnt quite get the results he needed.

We peel back layers of the past in Kuala Lumpur, one of Asias most cosmopolitan cities, then get lost in time in Tangier, a last redoubt for romantic dropouts. For beach-blanket readers, theres an excerpt from Elaine Sciolinos timely new book, La Seduction, about the role of flirtation and provocation in French society. And for wave-riders weve assembled a guide to cool new surf spots around the globe. Plus: the Selby heads to Melbourne. See all stories from the issue >>",2011-05-20T19:00:08+0000

us,Will the I.M.F. Rise Again?,"Everyone has some fascination with the combination of sex, money and power, but who would have thought they would all point to a career at the International Monetary Fund? Founded in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference with a mandate to prevent wild swings in national currency values, the fund, I would have imagined, would set itself against swinging of every kind. That is clearly not the case.According to Alan Beatties interview this morning with I.M.F. semi-renegade Simon Johnson, the fund was firstly aimed at helping struggling postwar economies in Western Europe, and its first loan (in 1947) was to France. For 35 of the funds 64 years, its managing director was French. When Western Europe had recovered, the fund went on to other things and secured for itself, lets say, a mixed reputation. From the 1960s onward, and culminating in the period of strict I.M.F. loan conditionality and rigid programs of structural adjustment, the fund earned a reputation as a corps of technocratic drones pitilessly contented in their air-conditioned hotel rooms as they imposed cookie-cutter solutions on prostrate governments. You would read from time to time of anti-I.M.F. riots in one poor capital or another, and you could guess what it meant, and it wasnt pretty.By the early part of our own century, the fund was entering a period of repentance, not least because some poorer countries were now emerging markets and making a big point of repaying I.M.F. loans and swearing never to take them again. Escaping the I.M.F. became a symbol of freedom. But if the fund wasnt making loans it had no income, and we know what that means: time for reform! Emerging-market players, with a sympathetic United States, pushed for changes in voting power. In essence, the developing world would get more I.M.F. power at the expense (slightly) of the United States and (mainly) of Europe. Several reforms, first undertaken in 2006 and most recently last year, would take the voting share of advanced economies from 60.6 to 55.3, and of emerging market and developing countries from 39.4 to 44.7.

Instead, its got Nazis, romance and old-fashioned storytelling chops, not to mention a cover that makes Berlin in 1933 look an awful lot like the Chicago of the 1893 Worlds Fair depicted on the front of Larsons blockbuster The Devil in the White City, which spent a total of 182 weeks on the hardcover and paperback lists starting back in 2003. Like that book, In the Garden of Beasts is shaped around the interlocking stories of two characters, the American ambassador William Dodd, who views Hitlers Berlin with growing alarm, and his daughter, Martha, who finds herself rather enchanted by all the glamorous men in uniform. (Think Carrie Bradshaw in Berlin, as USA Todays reviewer, Deirdre Donahue, put it.) In an interview with The Huffington Post Chicago, Larson, inset, explained his decision to give so much space to Martha, a former assistant literary editor at The Chicago Tribune who left her husband behind to gallivant with French diplomats, Russian agents and the head of the Gestapo: If Id hung the entire book on Dodd, it might have been interesting, but it would have lapsed into a diplomatic history.

The two New York-based artists, who recently began exhibiting collaborative work under the name Jules Marquis, share a Greenpoint studio but regularly shuttle to southeast Virginia, where theyve created a nonprofit art space on a corner of the Turner family farm. Named Jericho Ditch, after a local logging canal, it serves as a venue and creative getaway for fellow artists. It also embodies the Jules Marquis ethos: from the outside, its a shed in a field; inside, its a big-city-gallery-style white box lighted by symmetrical fluorescent tubes.

And Ms. Collette was widely praised for her performance in the title role, winning an Emmy Award in 2009 and a Golden Globe in 2010. But ratings for the series have diminished, from 816,000 viewers for the premiere of Season 2 to 411,000 viewers for the debut of Season 3 in March, The Hollywood Reporter reported.

For those who missed it I would urge you to go back and take a look at it. Here is a brief restatement, given a slightly different visual model from last week. Given any four arbitrary positive integers a, b, c and d, representing the top rung of a ladder, you construct another step below it, consisting of the positive differences between them taken cyclically: |a-b|, |b-c|, |c-d| and |d-a|. An example 2-step ladder is:1 2 5 91 3 4 8It turns out that all such ladders eventually end as all the numbers become zeroes.

Under a settlement negotiated by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and announced on Monday, the Speed will soon turn over the work to Homeland Security, which will transfer it to Italian cultural authorities.

The clothes have been featured alongside Rick Owens, Ann Demeulemeester and Yohji Yamamoto in editorials for SOME/THINGS magazine. His collection includes hand-painted striped tops (five to six hours of painting) that are frayed in all the right places (36 hours to machine-sew and hand finish) and have the perfect dose of weight to shield against a cool spring breeze. The fit is boyish and over sized but the imperfection of the lines add a touch of whimsy. The collection also has unconventionally shaped short jackets (another three to five days of sewing) and rich-hued duffel coats with detachable hoods (hand sewn for eight to nine days). Architecture gives you a set of problem-solving skills, he says. Once I started sewing, I got very into cutting patterns, developing stitches and constructing things. Each collection has only about a dozen pieces and is only available through special order. When things become large, you cant control it, says Mott.

Nature gave Canada the wide-angle view of the majestic waterfall that straddles the border between the two countries, and the Canadians commercial bet on tourism landed most of the visitor comforts on their side of the Niagara River. American reliance on industry, however, ended in Rust Belt ruin. Yet the story isnt so simple. Casinos, high-rise hotels and hucksterish come-ons have so proliferated in Niagara Falls, Ontario, that it risks feeling like a tired amusement park. Meanwhile, in Niagara Falls, New York, the visitor who ventures inside the shabby, underfinanced state park is surprised to discover vestiges of something like a natural landscape. The party is in Canada. The real feel of the river, in all its awesome power, is more accessible in the United States.

us,The Wrongful Conviction as Way of Life,"Judge Learned Hand called the ghost of the innocent man convicted an unreal dream. But in Convicting the Innocent, Brandon L. Garrett shows that it can be a nightmarish reality. Since the late 1980s, DNA testing has exonerated more than 250 wrongly convicted people, who spent an average of 13 years in prison for crimes they didnt commit. (There is every reason to think that more people have been wrongly convicted since then, but only these 250 have been definitively exonerated by postconviction DNA tests.) Seventeen of the 250 were sentenced to die, and 80 to spend the rest of their lives in prison. By poring over trial transcripts and interviewing lawyers, prosecutors and court reporters, Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, seeks to explore who these 250 innocent people are, and why they were wrongly convicted. His alarming conclusion: the wrongful convictions were not idiosyncratic but resulted from a series of flawed practices that the courts rely on every day, namely, false and coerced confessions, questionable eyewitness procedures, invalid forensic testimony and corrupt statements by jailhouse informers. Garretts book is a gripping contribution to the literature of injustice, along with a galvanizing call for reform. ",2011-05-26T19:23:36+0000

It really started because we noticed a shift in trends amongst our friends, says Moore, 28, who quit her day job at Cond Nast Digital a few short months after starting the line in the pink-walled apartment she shares with Botica (fittingly located on Manhattans Mott Street). Girls were finally starting to cover up with hats, sun block and tunics rather than trying to get as tan  and burned to a crisp  as possible. For the 27-year-old Botica, fashion is really a family affair. Theres a history of skin cancer in my family, she says. (An olive-green cotton poplin shirtdress with gold accents is named after Boticas younger sibling, Faith, $125.)

Owned by the Lambeth Council, the Brixton Windmill has just reopened this month after a 580,000 (about $937,000) renovation. The effort was initiated by a local residents group, the Friends of Windmill Gardens, which was established in 2003 to restore the landmarked but derelict windmill and transform its surrounding park.

Hadley, Thompson noted, is a first-rate psychologist who immerses the reader in her characters using a particularly intimate form of third-person narrator. And Hadley has presented half of her novel  which delves into some of the familiar problems of modern life also found in the womens novels one of the characters reads  from the perspective of a man. When I taught writing, Thompson recalled, inevitably students loved to worry this point, how you could identify male or female writing. So I brought in some blind samples: women writing about sea voyages, men writing about intense emotional experiences.

Less affluent students would not lose out, they say, because these new spots would be extra ones. Critics say the two-tier idea is profoundly unfair.

Under President Hu Jintao, Chinas evolution has paused, and there probably wont be more movement until after the Communist Party Congress in late 2012 installs Xi Jinping as Hus successor. I still would never bet against China, but I think India may be able to narrow the gap in the coming years.",2011-05-28T21:24:58+0000

Ms. Yellen was the producer of CBSs film The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana (1982), which drew a huge audience. William & Kate is more than a romance; its also a psychological story of the memory of the mother, in this case Princess Diana, and her legacy, Ms. Yellen said. The film shows how William has to choose to live his life with her memory and with the decisions he has to make, including the decision of whom to marry. The couple were married on April 29 in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Filming for the movie, which imagines some scenes from the couples romance, began in early May.

us,Fantasy Focus: Moving the Needle,"Its hard for a first-round pick to move up significantly, but aside from Jose Bautista, Ryan Braun is probably the top hitter in fantasy baseball this year. While Brauns 12 home runs and .588 slugging percentage through Sunday are improvements over last years rates, the number that jumps out most is his 13 steals in 14 attempts. Milwaukees new manager, Ron Roenicke, is more aggressive on the basepaths than his predecessor, Ken Macha: the Brewers are 14th in the majors in stolen bases this year, as opposed to 21st last year, and Braun in particular is getting the green light. At this pace, a 35-35 season is within reach, and with Braun, youre virtually assured a good batting average. Only Carlos Gonzalez and maybe Matt Kemp offer the same speed-power-average upside, and Gonzalez is struggling this year.Jacoby Ellsburys 2010 was a lost season because of rib injuries, but as he is 27, his value has never been higher. The 19 stolen bases through Sunday put him on pace for close to 60 steals, and thats not accounting for chilly early-season conditions that often slow the running game. Ellsbury also has 6 home runs and 16 doubles and is posting a .298/.368/.462 line in 208 at-bats while hitting leadoff in one of the leagues best lineups. In short, hes what the Red Sox hoped Carl Crawford would be when they gave him $142 million.

Instead, they simply raised the issue of how much money should be given and stressed that this is for individuals, not the group as a whole, said the letter, which had 127 signatures.
