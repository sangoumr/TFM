The spokeswoman, Stella Giammasi, said the station had made the decision after reviewing the half-hour program, which was to follow a new one-hour documentary, ""The Armenian Genocide,"" scheduled to be broadcast April 17 at 10 p.m. ""We just really had the opportunity to see both, and people here feel the documentary stands on it own,"" she said. United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat, who had held a protest outside the New York station on Saturday, praised the decision. Armenians worldwide have lobbied for decades to have the deaths of 1.5 million of their ancestors at the hands of Ottoman Turks recognized as genocide. Armenian groups and members of Congress have urged PBS to drop the debate program, which includes two scholars who contend that the death toll was exaggerated and that it did not result from a state-sponsored campaign, contrary to most historical accounts. PBS has offered both programs to its 348 affiliates but has left to them the decision whether to show either the film or debate or both. The network said it was not keeping track of the decisions.

us,"Arts, Briefly; For NBC, a Big 'Deal'","CBS sat on the sidelines for most of the February sweeps period, letting ABC and Fox chip away at NBC's Olympics ratings, which both networks did successfully. But CBS started fresh on Monday, and was the clear winner in what was otherwise a close night among Fox, ABC and NBC. Its victory was thanks to ""Two and a Half Men"" (an estimated 17.28 million viewers) and ""CSI: Miami"" (18 million), which lifted the rest of the schedule in total viewers and adults 18 to 49. The news on Monday, though, was that NBC's much-hyped new lineup had only one winner: the return of the game show ""Deal or No Deal"" (13.46 million) beat all of its competition at 8 p.m. But the season premiere of ""The Apprentice,"" starring Donald Trump, above, squandered that lead, drawing only 9.76 million viewers and placing fourth in the hour in the 18-to-49 demographic. ""The Apprentice"" performed poorly, compared with ""Las Vegas,"" which used to occupy that hour but has been moved to Fridays. And NBC's ""Medium"" suffered from its weakened lead-in, drawing only 10.42 million viewers. ""Medium,"" the Patricia Arquette psychic drama, was beaten easily by the second hour of ABC's ""Bachelor"" finale (11.5 million viewers over all), in which Dr. Travis Stork chose the good girl, Sarah Stone, after the bad girl, Moana Dixon, acted like a jerk in front of his family.

CAROL FUCHS","KAUFMAN--Dr. Carol Fuchs, 68, lived actively and fully with her husband, family, and friends, and fought ALS fiercely for five years until her passing on February 27, 2006. Born December 12, 1937, in the Bronx to the late Eva and Sam Fuchs, Carol relocated with her family to Kinston, NC where her father's shirt business, Hampton Industries, was opened. The family moved to Miami Beach where she attended Miami Beach High School. At Brandeis University on the first day of orientation she met the love of her life Jerry Kaufman of New York City.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   SCHERZER, IRWIN S.","SCHERZER--Irwin S. Passed away at the age of 73 on February 24, 2006. Beloved son of the late Hyman and Bertha Scherzer. Irwin grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts and was an honors graduate of Harvard College Class of 1954 and Harvard Business School Class of 1956. He served for two years as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy. He began his business career with west coast based RamoWooldridge Corp., but soon moved to New York and shifted his focus to the management of musical organizations. He got his start managing classical music bookings for Columbia Artists. Thereafter, he held several positions including Vice President of Grey Advertising with responsibility for the RCA classical musical label. In 1969, he became the founding administrative director of the newly formed Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. His management skills contributed mightily to the success of the fledgling effort, now one of the city's musical institutions. He worked closely with the directors of the Society including philanthropist Alice Tully. He subsequently became business manager and trusted adviser to Miss Tully who relied upon his many talents as she pursued her diverse activities in the arts and music. Irwin can only be described with superlatives. He was truly an example of the sui generis personality. Luminous intelligence, brilliant wit and raconteur, striking linguistic ability, generosity of spirit, a keen social conscience and indomitable courage in the face of adversity, these were the qualities that endeared him to his legion of friends. His knowledge of opera, classical music and the culinary arts was encyclopedic. His wit gushed forth in a seemingly unending flow of quips and jaunty apercus. He spoke six languages fluently and had a working knowledge of a half dozen more. He was never satisfied unless his friends shared fully in the realms that gave him pleasure, and thus did he enrich all who knew him. His social consciousness was manifested in his support of the battle against an outmoded social value. His zest for life never flagged despite daunting health issues. He lived a life filled with love and caring. Irwin is survived by his beloved partner, Chien Cho (JJ) Liu, and his devoted cousins Alicia, Babs, Harry, Gloria and Bobby. He will be sorely missed by his many friends who will forever cherish his memory and will find comfort in the warm remembrances of the good times spent with him. His memory can be honored by donations to Tannery Pond Concerts, P.O. Box 446, New Lebanon, NY 12125. A date for a memorial concert will be announced.",2006-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Pemex, as the company is known, invested $10.8 billion last year, with 89 percent spent on exploration and production and 7 percent on refining. The spending plan will need approval from the Finance Ministry because it is higher than the $9 billion Pemex budget approved by Congress, Mr. Surez said. The plan to more than double spending on refineries, to $1.83 billion from $756 million last year, is intended to help Mexico reduce its need to import gasoline.

(He stands second from the left at rear, above, in his only known photograph.) Before he entered a state insane asylum in 1907, Bolden brought New Orleans brass band traditions into contact with church music and the blues, by way of an outsize, swaggering style that influenced both Joe (King) Oliver and Louis Armstrong. He is also remembered, more dubiously, as a part-time barber and the publisher of a gossip broadside; Michael Ondaatje made those details an integral part of his portrayal of Bolden in the novel ""Coming Through Slaughter"" some 30 years ago. Popular perceptions of Bolden were shaped more than a little by Mr. Ondaatje's vivid fictionalization, which imagined life inside the humid atmosphere of E. J. Bellocq's Storyville photographs. A less fanciful depiction appeared in 1978 -- ""In Search of Buddy Bolden,"" by the historian Donald M. Marquis -- and it was this account that eventually captured the imagination of an aspiring trumpeter named Charles Porter, who traced Bolden's steps in New Orleans and heard the inkling of a theme. Nine years later, Mr. Porter is a Juilliard graduate, a Fulbright scholar and a former student of Wynton Marsalis, and his theme has blossomed into a six-part suite for seven musicians. The clear perils of this undertaking could be a selling point; by most accounts, Bolden was usually up for an adventure.

So the occasionally presented ""adults only"" variation on this musical about the agonies and ecstasies of a competitive provincial spelling contest -- with bawdy and otherwise rude dialogue substituted throughout -- is not simply a raunchy indulgence but also a riotously close look at the characters' most ticklish thoughts. Already fidgety, the teenage contestants (above, Jose Llana and cast members) are further tortured by peculiarly suggestive new words (""acouchi,"" ""vas deferens"") and definitions (""despite the excruciating pain, Frankie took some comfort in his suppedaneum""), and from their judges, they receive the academic equivalent of a pie in the face. (One of the students, Logainne, is said to be banned from her local movie house because of an indecent exposure during ""Fahrenheit 9/11."") Jay Reiss, who played Vice Principal Douglas Panch until October and continues to write for the show, said the concept began as a way to entertain himself and the cast during rehearsals.

The great modern choreographer Mark Morris, above, is honoring his dance group's 25th anniversary, and everyone is invited to the monthlong party. (The studio shows of smaller works at the company's luxurious Fort Greene home, down the street from the academy, are already sold out.) There will be photography exhibitions; musical performances, including karaoke with Mr. Morris as host, at the BAMcaf; a screening of Mr. Morris's 1992 ""Hard Nut,"" a ""Nutcracker"" satire with a heart of gold; showings of some of his favorite movies, like Robert Altman's ""Nashville""; and a pair of dialogues on collaborators and music. The dialogues, conducted with the quick-witted, eminently quotable Mr. Morris and others, are not to be missed. And, oh yes, three programs of intelligent, humanistic dancing, from the 1981 religious work ""Gloria,"" set to Vivaldi, to two New York premieres, ""Cargo"" and ""Candleflowerdance."" Sadly, Mr. Morris himself won't dance in any of these programs. But he will try his hand at conducting: as always, the company will perform to live music, and Mr. Morris will have a go with the baton. Birthday indulgence? Hardly. The musically agile Mr. Morris, the onetime enfant terrible of the dance world, has steadily expanded his bag of tricks since arriving on the scene with a bang all those years ago. (Ballet? Check. Opera? Why not. Brooklyn dance empire? Sure.) He rarely disappoints. (The formal dance festivities begin with a performance of Program A on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., but the Month of Mark gets started tonight with a 9 o'clock performance of the Western Caravan swing band.

For some critics, the significance of, say, taking sculpture off the pedestal and putting it on the floor approached that of Neil Armstrong's step down onto the surface of the moon. This made formalism ripe for satire by artists like Claes Oldenburg, Bruce Nauman and Pino Pascali, an irreverent Italian sculptor better known in Europe than in the United States. Each of the works from the 60's in Gagosian's delightful time capsule of a show playfully riffs on a formal innovation in modern art. Taking aim at Minimalist sculpture, Pascali made simple, floor-bound shapes resembling big black shark fins, turning the gallery hardwood into a metaphorical ocean's surface. Having fun with puritanical Minimalist painting, he made an almost all-white picture whose slightly convex surface, punctuated at the bottom edge by a dark, triangular patch, mimics the curves of a nude woman's torso. And he mocked macho industrial assemblage by constructing sculptures from wood and found materials that evoke pieces of military artillery. A big drab-green example on worn rubber tires (above) points its barrel upward at an unmistakably phallic angle. The simulated weapons also reflect a generation's anxious preoccupation with the war in Vietnam.

In conjunction with his late brothers Joseph, Hyman, and Max, and his brother, Charles, Arnold was a founding and dynamic partner of Segal and Segal, a real estate development company founded in 1950.

So the occasionally presented ""adults only"" variation on this musical about the agonies and ecstasies of a competitive provincial spelling contest A with bawdy and otherwise rude dialogue substituted throughout A is not simply a raunchy indulgence but also a riotously close look at the characters' most ticklish thoughts. Already fidgety, the teenage contestants (above, Jose Llana and cast members) are further tortured by peculiarly suggestive new words (""acouchi,"" ""vas deferens"") and definitions (""despite the excruciating pain, Frankie took some comfort in his suppedaneum""), and from their judges, they receive the academic equivalent of a pie in the face. (One of the students, Logainne, is said to be banned from her local movie house because of an indecent exposure during ""Fahrenheit 9/11."") Jay Reiss, who played Vice Principal Douglas Panch until October and continues to write for the show, said the concept began as a way to entertain himself and the cast during rehearsals. ""I would flip through the dictionary for words and see how fast I could make up a definition for them,"" he said. ""They tended toward the risquA."" The last of these shows this season A which are prominently advertised as unsuitable for children A will be presented on Sunday night, but since they have proved to be a smart marketing gimmick, bringing fans back to the theater, expect a return in the fall.

China Aviation's chairman, Jia Changbin, and two other directors, Gu Yanfei and Li Yongji, all pleaded guilty this week to charges they helped conceal the company's losses in a vain attempt to rescue it. China Aviation once held a near monopoly on importing jet fuel to China, but nearly collapsed after losing $550 million betting incorrectly against the price of oil. Its former finance chief, Peter Lim, was sentenced last month to two years in prison and fined 150,000 Singapore dollars, or $92,600.

You can drop in on a penguin feeding or paddle a kayak in search of floating baseballs in the bay. This stretch of the city south of Market Street, long known for its alternative art and music scene, has matured into a mix of trendy restaurants, gritty bars, swank hotels and warehouses reworked to stage live music. It has a bustling waterfront, a major league baseball stadium and engrossing museums. SoMa's character has been shaped by recent cycles of boom and bust. The district lost some of its edge during the frenzy of the late 1990's, as soaring rents shut down galleries and nightclubs and stock-inflated Internet start-ups moved in. When the high-tech bubble burst, SoMa's landscape shifted once again. Lofts languished vacant, and the well-to-do young people on Razor scooters vanished overnight. Lately, though, new life has sprouted. There is some scruffiness, and you can still duck into a club too cool to post its name above the door. But for all its youthful spirit, SoMa feels more grown-up -- not stodgy, but adult -- than ever, with family attractions by day and energy that lingers after dark. JOSH SENS",2006-03-03T05:00:00+0000

ABC was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49, but excluding the Super Bowl, Fox, the ""American Idol"" network, won the all-important advertising sales measurement. CBS wasn't really in the race, as it ceded the competition by broadcasting repeats most of the month. But this week, CBS peeked out from under the covers, and on Thursday it was No. 1 among total viewers, as usual. Fox ranked first for the night among 18-to-49-year-olds. Its ""Idol"" (26.18 million estimated viewers) battered CBS's ""Survivor"" (16.24 million) for the second week in a row.

A fair sampling of its chapter headings would include ""Digging and Preparation"" and ""More Digging."" Yet this otherwise unprepossessing Web site has registered more than 100,000 page views. And that pales in comparison with ""Jeannie"" and ""Aaron,"" of www.houseinprogress.net, whose rescue of a ""sad, neglected, muddled"" Chicago bungalow started out, like most houseblogs, as a modest e-circular for friends and relatives.

But why does such a big deal look so small, so slight, with its bland paintings, self-regarding videos, artful tchotchkes and shoppable M.F.A. artists-to-watch? There has to be another way to go, an alternative to a used-up ""alternative."" By far the most interesting option so far, one that began to be news a few years ago and has increased its visibility since, is the work of miniature subcultures known as collectives. Basically, art collectives do away with the one-artist-one-object model. They come in various sizes and formats: couples, quartets, teams, tribes and amorphous cyberspace communities. Sometimes a group of artists assumes the identity of a single person; sometimes, a single artist assumes the identity of many. Membership may be official, or casual, or even accidental: friends brainstorming in an apartment or strangers collaborating on the Internet from continents away. And they may or may not refer to their activities as art. Research, archiving and creative hacking are just as likely to produce objects, experiences, information that is politically didactic or end-in-itself beautiful, or both. One way or another, joint production among parties of equal standing -- we're not talking about master artist and studio assistants here -- scrambles existing aesthetic formulas. It may undermine the cult of the artist as media star, dislodge the supremacy of the precious object and unsettle the economic structures that make the art world a mirror image of the inequities of American culture at large. In short, it confuses how we think about art and assign value to it. This can only be good.",2006-03-05T05:00:00+0000

The writer and director ARNAUD DESPLECHIN is one of the most exciting filmmakers working today, and as he digs deep into these radically different, self-interested subjectivities, he employs discordant tones and moods, and a couple of stunning narrative turns, including a late-act twist of the Oedipal knife, that testify to his restless genius.

us,Up Front,"This week marks the debut of ""Across the Universe,"" a new science fiction column by Dave Itzkoff. An editor at Spin magazine and the author of ""Lads: A Memoir of Manhood,"" Itzkoff became a sci-fi fan while in grade school. ""I was a bit of an insomniac when I was a kid,"" he said in an e-mail message, ""partly because of an irrational fear that the world was going to be destroyed either by a nuclear war or by crashing into the sun. When I couldn't sleep, I'd usually watch reruns of 'The Twilight Zone' on WPIX -- many of which end with the world being destroyed either by a nuclear war or by crashing into the sun. I found it oddly comforting to see these apocalyptic scenes played out, and also to learn that these fears weren't mine alone."" Itzkoff hopes his column ""can help demystify the genre for readers who believe, mistakenly, that sci-fi and fantasy books have nothing to offer them, and to show them that the boundaries of these categories are fluid and ever-expanding. As far as I'm concerned, books like Jared Diamond's 'Collapse' and Don DeLillo's 'White Noise' qualify as science fiction, as do films like 'A History of Violence' and television series like 'Lost.' "" On a scale of 1 to 10, we asked him, how geeky are you?

In ""The Adrian Mole Diaries,"" a success of near-Potteresque proportions back in the mid-1980's, Townsend set her hero's teenage angst against the more serious travails of Margaret Thatcher's Britain. In successive diaries, Townsend followed Adrian through marriage and fatherhood, and success as a chef at a trendy London restaurant with his own TV cooking show. This latest installment finds him on the downslope, post-marriage and post-fame, 34 years old and working in a bookstore back in his native Leicester. It is autumn 2002, and Adrian is quarreling with a travel agent who won't refund the 57.10 deposit for a vacation he canceled when Tony Blair announced Saddam Hussein needed only 45 minutes to deploy weapons that could demolish Cyprus. This hopeless pursuit -- and Adrian's increasing disenchantment with Blair and the Iraq war -- underpin a story that gently tweaks many aspects of life in contemporary Britain: condo-loft conversions (Adrian buys one at ""The Old Battery Factory, Rat Wharf,"" overlooking a canal inhabited by viciously territorial swans), credit card debt, New Agers and writers' groups.

Glaeser grew up on the East Side of Manhattan, went to school in Princeton, N.J., and Chicago, lived for a time in Cambridge, Mass., and Palo Alto, Calif., and recently moved with his wife and young son to a house on six and a half acres in the affluent suburb of Weston, Mass. To Glaeser, this last move has been a big adjustment. For one thing, he is not a good driver, and the new commute has prompted him to leave his house by 6 a.m. so as not to get ensnared in the morning rush hour. For another, Glaeser and the suburbs are clearly an unholy marriage of sensibilities, especially since his new house is bordered by about 600 acres of conservation land. ""I wake up every day, thinking, My goodness, how many units of housing could you build here?"" he says. Glaeser is a creature of density. An economist at Harvard, he has spent almost his entire professional life walking around, and thinking about, cities -- seeking explanations why some metropolitan areas thrive and some suffer and what factors make some places pricey and some cheap. He is just 38. In the years since earning his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, though, he has been prolific and provocative in a way that has left many of his colleagues awestruck. ""I think he's a genius,"" says George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001. Gary Becker, an economist at the University of Chicago and a Nobel laureate, notes that before Glaeser came along, ""urban economics was dried up. No one had come up with some new ways to look at cities."" David Cutler, Glaeser's Harvard colleague and an academic star in his own right, puts it this way: ""I think Ed is probably the most exciting urban researcher in half a century, if not longer.""",2006-03-05T05:00:00+0000

Dunant, who was born in 1950, is much more familiar in her native England, where she's presented programs on BBC radio and television and is a well-regarded cultural critic. Earlier in her literary career she was known for a series of thrillers that featured a ""feminist private eye"" -- one critic's term -- named Hannah Wolfe. (Hannah was good company: ""The baddies are never quite the ones you want them to be,"" she cracked in one novel.) These thrillers usually tackled thorny topics like animal rights and surrogate motherhood. Critics have tended to approve of Dunant's move into historical fiction, a tough genre to master. (""There are no paeans to the watery beauty of Venice,"" Laura Miller wrote about Dunant's new book in Salon. ""Dunant doesn't make a fetish out of romantic love either. . . . 'Courtesan' finally emerges as something very rare, a celebration of the complicated and undersung affections that flourish between colleagues and friends."") Last year Dunant told an interviewer: ""The skills I learned from thrillers -- how to construct a compelling story, how to hold the reader, how to play with them, how to not let you want to put the book down -- all these have not deserted me. They have, I hope, simply been used on a bigger canvas.""",2006-03-05T05:00:00+0000

At the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island, the hip-hop radio station Power 105 is giving itself a birthday party on Sunday.

(Perhaps he'll also talk about the police investigation into the recent death at his video shoot, though he'll have to do it carefully. Fans would probably love to hear him say he won't talk to the cops, but his lawyers would probably be less enthused.) He is to be joined by the brash young Harlem hip-hop star JUELZ SANTANA, the emerging crooner NE-YO, the Atlanta group DEM FRANCHIZE BOYZ and, perhaps best of all, the thrilling R & B star KEYSHIA COLE; she sounds ferocious even when -- as on her current hit, ""Love"" -- she's merely telling everyone how happy she is. 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9303; $35.50 to $95.50.",2006-03-05T05:00:00+0000

At the story's center are Johnny Farrell, a corrupt mayoral aide, and Mike Briody, a construction worker who runs guns for the Irish Republican Army.

He and his family prospered along with the city; 17 years after building his house, he was rich enough to buy the one next door, into which his daughter and her husband moved. In 1683 he was still listed as the owner of both properties.

NBC was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49, with an average of 11.04 million viewers in primetime. (""Las Vegas"" drew 10.87 million and ""Conviction"" 10.15 million.) But CBS managed to bring in 11.88 million; its biggest draw was ""Ghost Whisperer"" with Jennifer Love Hewitt (12.28 million) at 8 p.m., which faced down NBC's game show ""Deal or No Deal"" (12.09 million). Without the Friday results show of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" ABC fell to third place for the night. Its ""In Justice"" particularly suffered from the absence of ""Dancing,"" bringing in only 6.6 million viewers. KATE AURTHUR",2006-03-06T05:00:00+0000

The city's Economic Development Corporation, which oversees city-owned piers, wants to build a huge passenger cruise ship terminal on the site and has not decided whether to renew the lease of American Stevedoring Inc., which operates the terminal. Mr. Nadler and Mr. Yassky urged the city to renew the lease, set to expire in March 2007, or to sign a lease with another container-terminal operator. The corporation has proposed creating a new container terminal at Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and moving the jobs there, but Mr. Nadler and Mr. Yassky said the agency had done nothing to implement that idea. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he was sympathetic, but added that the city's port resources were limited. ""We're trying to keep a port facility, a container facility, in Brooklyn and there is a need for it, but I think just if you look at the land, there's never going to be the kind of land you need to build an enormous one,"" he said.",2006-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Steven Bochco, right, has yielded control of the series to work on his own pilot, ABC executives said yesterday. Mr. Bochco, the creator of some of television's most praised dramas, including ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""NYPD Blue,"" took over ""Commander in Chief"" in October when ABC removed the show's creator, Rod Lurie, from day-to-day supervision. ""Commander in Chief,"" which stars Geena Davis as the first female president, started the season with strong ratings, but after several weeks, the production crew fell behind in delivering episodes, and the ratings began to fade. ABC installed Mr. Bochco, who was already signed with its affiliated studio Touchstone to develop another drama. Mr. Bochco took some weeks to make changes in the direction of ""Commander in Chief,"" but ratings never recovered, and ABC shelved the series in February, saying the move was temporary. It is scheduled to return April 18 and will finish the season, ABC said, with Dee Johnson, another executive producer, as the new supervisor. Mr. Bochco will remain an executive producer, but ABC executives said he had left the series and was now shooting his pilot, a crime drama called ""Hollis and Rae,"" in Savannah, Ga.

The two sides had reached an impasse when the company said the dancers were on strike, and the dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, contended that they had been locked out. The dancers had said they were seeking a new contract to protect their jobs, safety and health. They specifically cited concerns over the scheduling of rehearsals and performances and the way management had handled dismissals. The company argued that problems revolved around artistic control.

The singing siblings inherited an eclectic style sense from their musician parents, Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. But even with such a pedigree, they found that putting together looks for this shoot was double the trouble. Rufus stuck to very, very tight jeans by Diesel, a bracelet by Subversive Jewelry and a necklace by Julianna Raye Designs, because thats how he feels most at ease. Martha, who is most comfortable in big sweaters and underwear, went with something less expected. He was more prepared, she says, but hes got a lot more clothes than I do.",2006-03-08T21:25:08+0000

A Seville-based auction house, Arte, Informacin y Gestin, announced yesterday that it would start bidding at $10,755 for three oil paintings it believed had been executed by Franco. The paintings depict scenes of Morocco, where he began his military career, and were signed with the pseudonym Geron, said the auction house director, Carmen Aranguren. They were to be sold on April 5 in what was touted as the first auction of Franco's work. But a spokesman for his family contested the authenticity of the paintings yesterday, saying that Franco painted only flowers, still lifes and copies of works, never Moroccan landscapes. He did not use a pseudonym, either, the spokesman told the Europa Press news agency. The auction house has decided to withdraw the paintings from the block until it can verify the artist, Ms. Aranguren said in a telephone interview. DALE FUCHS",2006-03-09T05:00:00+0000

At cafes, immaculately coiffed Southern socialites sit beside pierced and tattooed students from the North Carolina School of the Arts, and an idle brick smokestack from a century-old R. J. Reynolds tobacco plant stands near a domed Cesar Pelli skyscraper that looks like a giant roll-on antiperspirant. You can go to an art museum in what was once a tobacco tycoon's mansion and you can take in Nascar races or visit a museum devoted to stock cars. The city -- known as the birthplace and home of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts -- has galleries that sell turned wood furniture and hand-stitched quilts. Winston-Salem (population 187,500), in the Piedmont region at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was created in 1913 after the consolidation of the post offices of two adjacent small towns: Salem, founded in 1766 by the Moravian Protestant sect, and Winston, established in 1849 and named for a local Revolutionary War hero. Events like the National Black Theater Festival, held every two years, and the annual RiverRun International Film Festival attract tens of thousands -- but perhaps the biggest draw is the relaxed Southern sensibility, which makes it the kind of place where lingering over a sweetened iced tea is always encouraged.

Ms. Abrams answered and heard the astonishing news that New York City was willing to sell the city-owned building that housed WOW for a mere $1. The bad news was that the tenants, who also include several other arts organizations and a housing rights group, would need to raise $2.5 million to bring the building up to code standards. WOW, whose name stands for Women's One World, had been founded two decades earlier with the vision of providing a space for performing arts by women. That dream had been realized. Perhaps this could be, too. So Ms. Abrams and others set about raising some $90,000. Now WOW and the other tenants have taken ownership of the building, a milestone Ms. Abrams will acknowledge with ""Asunder,"" an evening of new dances by herself, Clarinda Mac Low and Tara O'Con. A specialist in contact improvisation, a highly developed improvisational and choreographic style, Ms. Abrams will present ""8:55 a.m."" (above, with Ms. Abrams, left, Jodi Bender and Ariel Polonsky), a dance about three women responding to the chaos of the city. Ms. Mac Low, a longtime presence on the downtown dance scene and probably the only choreographer with a degree in molecular biology and biochemistry, will investigate the lives of tyrants in ""Which.""

He is survived by his loving daughters Linda & Deborah and his brother Jerome Shaw, as well as sons-in-law Bruce and Neil and seven grandchildren. Founder, President and Chairman of the Board of Volt Information Sciences, Inc. Services will be held Sunday, March 12, 2006 at 12:00 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel 21 West Broad St. Mount Vernon NY. In lieu of flowers the family has requested donations be made to the National Parkinson Foundation, 1501 NW 9th Ave, Bob Hope Road, Miami, FL 33136-1494 or www.parkinson. org. William Shaw and his younger brother, Jerome Shaw, invested $13 and founded Volt in 1950. As leader of the fledgling company, William Shaw sought a name that would suggest the image of ""potential"" and ""high energy,"" and the name ""Volt"" was selected. ""Information Sciences"" later was added because it indicated leading-edge technology in many disciplines in the marketplace. ""Bill Shaw overcame great physical challenges and was an amazing example of what you can accomplish through persistence and belief in yourself,"" said Jerome Shaw, Executive Vice President. ""He had excellent business abilities and was an extremely wise and capable businessman. I was a sponge at his side and was constantly learning. When Volt was 20 weeks old and slightly off the ground, Bill invited me out for a Saturday walk. On that walk Bill offered me 50 percent of Volt. It was an unbelievably generous offer. My brother and I were very close. He was my brother, my boss, and my best friend. That closeness grew to a unique relationship, which has lasted our lifetime. I will miss him profoundly."" During more than five decades at the helm of Volt, William Shaw used his abilities to envision and build an innovative, global organization that emphasizes sound financial management, the development of human potential and the application of new technologies. His drive, imagination, and creativity while President and Chairman of Volt, highlights of which are described below, have led to Volt's tremendous growth from a startup entrepreneurial venture to a Fortune 1000 corporation. Volt originally provided technical publication services. Under Bill Shaw's direction, Volt developed significant engineering knowledge and publication reproduction expertise in the early days of the Atlas and Mercury space programs, which were crucial to the Company's initial success. Later, when asked to provide large numbers of temporary personnel to staff various client projects and businesses, Bill embraced the challenge, thus fostering Volt's entry into the employment marketplace. This staffing division was the forerunner of Volt Services Group, which today has more than 300 branch offices across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. When the opportunity to purchase Autologic, a leading-edge electronic imaging and typesetting company, presented itself in 1971, Bill welcomed the chance to apply its capabilities to Volt's existing operations and expand successfully into new opportunities. The Autologic business gave Volt strong entree into telephone directory production and services. While Autologic itself has been sold, as a result, Volt Directory Systems and Services today is one of the nation's largest independent directory producers as well as providing multimedia services to publishers on four continents. Volt's growth in providing technical services and professionals to telephone companies, provided Bill Shaw a strong base upon which to launch the Company's telecommunications services division in 1976. From the performance of a full range of engineering, construction and installation services, this division continues to incorporate emerging technologies in business systems integration and local and wide area network installation as well as wireless services. Seeking business opportunities in the growing technology arena, Bill Shaw expanded the Company through further acquisitions. In 1980, Volt acquired Volt Delta and Maintech, establishing the computer systems subsidiary, which pioneered computer-generated directory assistance systems and voice enhancement features. Today, as part of Volt's Computer Systems segment, VoltDelta markets a suite of Internet-based information services solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. Maintech's services portfolio includes hardware maintenance, network operations center services and technology refresh services. Further corporate milestones achieved by Volt under Mr. Shaw include listing on the New York Stock Exchange, inclusion in a Standard and Poor's Index, achieving ISO-9002 certification, adopting Six Sigma methodologies, as well as receiving numerous awards of recognition from corporate and community organizations. In December 2006 Mr. Shaw was instrumental in the Volt Delta Resources LLC subsidiary's acquisition of Varetis Solutions GMBH and the repurchase of a minority interest from Nortel Networks which it had received for contributing certain assets and certain liabilities of its directory and operator services business to VoltDelta in August, 2004. ""We grieve the loss of my uncle,"" said Steve Shaw, Executive Vice President andCEO of Volt. ""Volt has lost a remarkable man, leader, visionary and friend. His loss will be deeply felt throughout the organization."" Bill Shaw will be profoundly missed by his family and friends, company employees, past and present, and by the individuals and organizations he influenced and affected throughout the business community.",2006-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: March 10 - March 16; ANTHONY BRAXTON 12+1(TET),"Thirty years ago, it was difficult to claim fealty to jazz and not confront, in one way or another, the intense and rigorous music of Anthony Braxton. As a composer, theorist and saxophonist, Mr. Braxton, above, exemplified the brazen intellectualization of jazz's avant-garde; his pieces often included instructions in the form of geometric pictographs, and his process revealed an affinity for classical conceptualism. This was a compelling enough alternative -- in the era that officially gave rise to jazz repertory on the one hand and commercialized fusion on the other -- to sustain the support of a major label and the attention of the mainstream media, at least for a few heady years. Mr. Braxton has been tirelessly prolific since that cultural moment, but he has also become something of a recluse, establishing himself at Mills College in the 1980's and Wesleyan University since the 90's. Last fall, Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn., toasted Mr. Braxton's 60th birthday with a three-month series of performances and lectures, including a colloquium discussing his influence. The ensemble that Mr. Braxton leads here could serve the same purpose, stocked as it is with younger players fluent in his language; some, like the cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum and the saxophonist Steve Lehman, are Wesleyan alumni who have been applying Braxtonian methods to their own projects. But of course, the reason not to miss this engagement is Mr. Braxton himself, whose playing is as terse and riveting as ever, and whose concept has never faltered in its evolution.

When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she was a 16-year-old Jewish girl living in Sosnowiec, a town close to the German border. She volunteered to take the place of her older sister, Raizel, who had been ordered to report to a Nazi forced labor camp for six weeks. But the six weeks stretched into almost five years of servitude for Sala, in seven different camps, with a pittance for wages or none at all, filthy quarters and an abundance of typhus-carrying lice. Her luck was that her labor-worthiness as a seamstress saved her from Auschwitz, a main extermination center, where her parents and other family members died. The story of Sala (she is alive and well at 82 and has grandchildren with her husband of 60 years, Sidney Kirschner) is told in a stirring new exhibition at the New York Public Library, which draws on more than 300 cherished letters from family and friends; photographs (above, Sala, from 1945); and a diary that she managed to squirrel away during her years of servitude (for a while the Nazis let forced laborers send and receive mail, provided it was written in German). Crucial elements of her saga -- which she kept under wraps for more than 50 years -- include the protective support of an older campmate, Ala Gertner, later hanged at Auschwitz for her part in an uprising there; the kindness of a local German family to whose home she was sent under guard to use its sewing machine; her close comradeship with female workers at the various camps; her introduction to her husband, then a G.I., at a Rosh Hashana service after the camps were liberated; her postwar discovery of her two surviving sisters; and her emigration as a war bride to the United States in 1946.

us,The Listings: March 10 - March 16; 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE',"The longstanding battle between cat people and dog people is turning into a blowout -- at least in regard to the New York theater scene. More than five years after Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical ""Cats"" closed on Broadway, feline-themed plays have become something of a cottage industry. This season, there are acrobatic cats in the long-running ""Moscow Cats Theater,"" now playing at the Lamb's Theater, and anthropomorphized kitties in ""Indoor/Outdoor,"" a play running at DR2 Theater. ""Dog Sees God,"" a poorly received sendup of the ""Peanuts"" comic strip, may have piqued the interest of dog lovers, but to no avail: Snoopy dies before the play even begins. Sound gruesome? It's nothing compared to the pet fatalities in Martin McDonagh's ""Lieutenant of Inishmore,"" a superb comedy in which cats figure largely in much of the dialogue and all of the major plot twists. The play, which is running at the Atlantic Theater before moving to Broadway later in the spring, begins with two men (above Peter Gerety, left, and Domhnall Gleeson) staring at the dead cat of a sadistic terrorist who eventually decides to form a splinter group whose aim will be to track down and destroy cat-killers, the lowest form of human (or any other) life. Dog murders, he says, are something else entirely. Considering the success of ""Inishmore,"" don't be surprised to see a musical version of ""Garfield"" opening soon.

His beloved wife, Vera, predeceased him when she was called to her heavenly reward on March 3, 1992. He was a career police officer in the New York City Police Department, with 35 years of service. He retired in May, 1971, with Rank of ""Deputy Chief."" His assignments were many and varied, working his way from foot patrol in the 7th Precinct in Manhattan to command of the 11th Division in Brooklyn, a post he held for five years, until retirement. In 1960 he was Captain of the 60th Precinct (Coney Island). An interesting note, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, 1960, from Park Department records, some 45 million people who visited this recreational facility were policed by a patrol force of 400 men under his command. He supervised Patrol, Administrative and Plainclothes duties in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. While assigned as Administrative Officer of Brooklyn South Patrol Forces, he authored an article on ""Police Administration"" that was published in the ""Police Management Review"". He conducted ""Operations Management Seminars"" and ""Criminal Investigation"" courses at the New York City Police Academy. He served as a Panel Member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board. During retirement, in July of 1994, he prepared a manuscript, chronicling some of the experiences of his interesting thirtyfive career years, rising up through seven ranks and working for nine Police Commissioners. In December of 1996 his book, ""THE POLICE CAREER: An Endless Challenge,"" published by Vantage Press, was officially released on the literary market. In January of 2003 he conceived the idea to document his ""MEMOIRS,"" covering the date of his birth, July 20, 1910, to 1936. He felt that his experiences were of such caliber, unique, unusual, beyond comparison and challenge, that they were worthy of documentation. He ""lived out"" his ambitions and youthful fantasies, as preludes to his ""Police Career."" The bottom line is that he played Broadway and he patrolled Broadway. ""MEMOIRS, 1910 to 1936: That Shaped My Life"" was published in 2004 by Vantage Press. He is a Life Member of the following Organizations: The P.B.A. of the New York City Police Department, The Captain's Endowment Association, The International Association of the Chiefs of Police, The International Police Association, the U.S. Section, District 11.

Had she been older, her doctors would almost certainly have recommended amniocentesis to screen for genetic disorders. But she was 31, so they did not, despite the fact that she had an unusual pregnancy. Branca bled during her first trimester, a possible indication of birth defects, and at her midterm sonogram, when she was 20 weeks pregnant, her fetus looked smaller than it should have based on when her doctors originally presumed she conceived. Branca had not gained much weight, either, but her doctors -- whom she is barred from identifying, by a legal settlement -- saw no cause for alarm. ""Looking back now, of course, it's easy to say I should have asked more questions or maybe been a little more concerned,"" she told me last fall, sitting in her grassy backyard in Orangeburg, 20 miles north of Manhattan. Branca is a pretty woman, dark and compact, with a winning suburban New York accent. She glanced at A.J., a 6-year-old with a head of dark curls and the mental capacity of a 6-month-old.

Teddy Roosevelt's trip in 1909 to the Kenyan bush (dressed by the outdoor specialist Abercrombie & Fitch, yes, that A&F) first made Americans safari savvy, while Hemingway, in the 30's, made safari jackets chic. Esquire promoted them as day wear, and Hollywood took up the look in movies like ""Mogambo."" But the safari jacket was all but extinct when Yves Saint Laurent revived it in 1968. Suddenly, both sexes were great white hunters, men wearing theirs with scarves, shades and sideburns. In the 70's, in fact, Banana Republic built an entire retail concept around it.

The wonderful movie, the best of the eight recent films shown in the Museum of Modern Art series Canadian Front, captures the parental devotion, expectations and disappointments, sibling rivalries and struggle for self-definition within a closely knit clan of five boys. The mother (DANIELLE PROULX) is devout and sensible. The father (MICHEL CT), although determined that Zac grow up to be a man's man, is no bully; he worships Patsy Cline and sings along with Charles Aznavour records at holiday gatherings. This is the kind of truthful family drama that Hollywood seems incapable of making. If it were, such a film would be as a big hit in the United States as ""C.R.A.Z.Y"" was in Canada.",2006-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Though most of us associate it with lethal cocktails, and with at least one memorably bad night in college, a new generation of distillers is ignoring its mixed reputation and creating versions that are distinctive enough to convert even the most resistant palates. By United States law, gin must have a flavor dominated by juniper berry, so each brand's unique profile comes from its secondary notes. Hendrick's Gin, introduced in 2000, is distilled with 11 botanicals, rose petals and cucumbers, a combination that makes it dangerously easy to drink. No. 209, a sister project of the Rudd Vineyards and Winery of Oakville, Calif., uses bergamot and cardamom for a round mouth feel, while Damrak, made in Amsterdam (the spirit's birthplace is the Netherlands), is full flavored, distilled with 17 botanicals. The titan among them, however, is Plymouth Gin. A great gin of the 18th century, it stumbled during World War II, and by the time Absolut's parent company took interest in the moribund label in 2000, a bottle of Plymouth was as easy to spot as an MG. Now the brand's clean and smooth flavor has become the mixologist's favorite. Whatever you do, don't waste your time with a gin and tonic: the quinine in the tonic smothers the gin, like dousing a steak with ketchup. Opt for a classic aperitif, like a Negroni.

But don't count him out. In May, Harvard University Press plans to publish ""On Hashish,"" a slim volume of Benjamin's little-known writings about his occasional drug use. It's got a good chance of becoming this year's version of Harry Frankfurt's ""On Bull - - - -,"" an academic book that makes it onto the front tables at Barnes & Noble. (Harvard says its volume was in the works before Frankfurt's book took off.) Benjamin experimented with hashish and other drugs in the late 1920's and early 30's, after being recruited by friends as a test subject. ""On Hashish"" is mostly culled from his notes for a book he planned to write. Benjamin wasn't always fond of hashish's effects -- he referred to the drug as ""poison"" -- but he did experience an ample amount of what he called ""profane illumination."" His notes have the makings of a cerebral dorm-room stoner classic. Here are three of Benjamin's observations: a) ""Feeling of understanding Poe much better now""; b) ""One seeks occasions for laughter""; c) ""Oven turns into cat.""",2006-03-12T05:00:00+0000

It's an ambition that has since died, but my love of cycling endures. I follow all the professional races, especially the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia. And over the years, I've amassed quite a collection of bikes. I keep two Trek mountain bikes in my house in Italy, a Gary Fisher bike in London and a traditional black town bicycle in Paris. (O.K., I cycle only to my showroom on it and keep it parked in the basement of the Ritz.) But of all my beloved bicycles, my heart belongs to a handmade model by Rasmus Gjesing of Cykelmageren, in Copenhagen. When Gjesing delivered it to me in London, he rode it to my studio. And it is perfection on wheels. First, the paint: a glossy, clear red. Then, the handsome brushed aluminum handlebars and gleaming chain set. A classic leather saddle by Brooks is a superb finishing touch. I compare the world of cycling to fashion: the enthusiasm, energy, teamwork, planning, confidence and ideas.

A loving, dedicated father who was generous to those in need, a champion of human rights who established the Jarkow Institute for Latin American Studies with the Anti-Defamation League, a business mogul in the children's wear industry, an avid hunter, died of natural causes, peacefully, in his home in Boca Raton, on March 9. He was 90 years old. Mr. Jarkow's passion was for the well-being and love of his family, his wife of 68 years, Edna, and their children, Joan, Kenneth, and Jerilynne, and son-in-law Michael Fierstein. Pappy, as he was called by his six grandchildren and their spouses, Jon and Kerri Halpern, Julie and James Cook, Jason and Katelyn Halpern, Candace Sands, Adam and Adriana Jarkow, and David Fierstein; and their nine great-grandchildren, Kelsey and Joel Halpern, Eliana and Jacob Sands, Leah McClean Jackson and Kelsie Cook and Max Halpern. He is also survived by his sister Adele. Always the salesman, Mr. Jarkow began at age 13, selling balloons on the streets in Coney Island, NY. As an adult, he began selling children's clothing for A.S. Lazarus & Co., developing a rapport with small children's retailers as well as large department stores across the country. In 1943, he established his own firm, Sydney Infants Wear in New York City, which manufactured and jobbed children's wear and children's toys and products. Kent, Inc., and Pixie Playmates rounded out his business endeavors. For more than 50 years, Mr. Jarkow was an industry leader in both sales and charitable endeavors. His son Kenneth worked by his side until the business was sold to Gerber Products at the end of the 20th century. Throughout his life, Sydney--also known as Chick by his close friends-was a philanthropist. Whether it was his generosity with his family and extended family or human rights issues close to his heart or a stranger who serendipitously entered his life, Sydney opened his heart, gave a personal helping hand, and reached for his wallet. ""If I can help, I should help. I worked hard and reaped the financial benefits, so why shouldn't I share that with those who are in need?"" Sydney often said, and there were many who benefited. Mr. Jarkow's international contributions for human rights manifested itself through the Anti-Defamation League. In 1986, he established the Jarkow Institute for Latin America. The Institute enables the ADL to expand human rights programs throughout Latin America. He remained chairman until his death, and he began the institute with Rabbi Martin M. Rosenthal, Executive Director. The Jarkow family is celebrating his life and accomplishments at a private family service in Boca Raton, FL.

Both Rich and Amis are apologists for drinking -- a position undoubtedly more contrarian now than it was in Amis's day -- and both offer useful advice for how to go about it, with Amis taking a more mixological approach. Rich cites Amis's birthday (April 16) as one of his ""365 Excuses to Get Loaded"" -- a nice touch.

To publicize GE's Carousel of Progress exhibit at the 1963-64 New York World's Fair, Joe flew a family of three Disney Studios life-size animatronic robots on a scheduled flight from Los Angeles to New York, First Class. Also on Joe's resume was a part in Elia Kazan's film ""A Face In The Crowd,"" in which he brought uncanny depth to the part of ""Press Agent,"" and gave realism and complex meaning to his sole line, ""Right!"" Joe, always left of center, was greatly amused when his union, The Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, became part of IATSE. One of the films Joe worked on in the nineteen fifties was On The Waterfront. A memorial gathering is anticipated sometime in the spring in New York City.

He was mindful of the need to keep high-quality medical care alive, and to this end he championed a Medicare voucher system as a means of revitalizing our ailing healthcare system. He was tough, never complained even when facing bleak prospects and worked until the day before he died. He was a great doctor.

The Bank of Japan cut the amount of cash it provides to lenders and may raise rates this year as economic growth quickens. Investors expect the Fed and the European Central Bank to continue raising rates as their economies expand.

John married Jeanne McGauran (now deceased, April 2005) in 1944, when both began their life-long devotion to each other and to the seven children they raised, eventually celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. John's career took the family from Chicago to California where he was named president of GTE Lenkurt Inc., in 1959. In 1963, John was appointed executive vice president of finance for GTE, which brought the family to New York, and then Stamford, CT. John was elected vice chairman of GTE in 1976. Upon retirement he and Jeanne moved back to California, where they lived in Woodside for over twenty years, before taking up their final residence in San Mateo. An avid fisherman, golfer, and sports fan, especially of football, John also enjoyed travel with Jeanne and his many friends, and planned many very special family trips. He is survived by his six children; John, Steve, Mary Douglas Benziger, Ann, Patty Douglas Wheeler, all of whom live locally, and Tom, from Westport, CT. Also surviving are his 15 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. John was predeceased by his sister, Mary Krueger and son, Chuck.

us,Memo Pad,"FARE INCREASES -- Southwest Airlines set off a new round of domestic fare increases over the weekend when it raised some ticket prices as much as $10 one way. Other big airlines, among them American, United, Northwest, Delta and Continental, quickly raised their fares by similar amounts. In an e-mail message to airfare analysts yesterday, Southwest blamed fuel prices for the increases, which are as low as $2 on some shorter flights. But the $10 increase on longer flights means that a $299 one-way cap on fares that Southwest imposed last year is now $309, said Terry Trippler, the airfare analyst at Cheapseats.com. Last year, airlines raised fares in a series of $10 increments over many months, but Mr. Trippler said he did not expect that pattern to be repeated. Rather, he said, fares will probably increase on selected popular routes. In all, he predicted that domestic coach leisure fares -- typically, nonrefundable fares paid in advance -- would rise an average of 10 percent this year and that business fares, typically bought at the last minute, would rise 5 percent on average.",2006-03-14T05:00:00+0000

Diminished ratings for the show are relative, though: it still had 22.1 million viewers, and was a close second to ""Grey's Anatomy"" (22.5 million), also on ABC, the night's most-watched program.

Mr. Brown, who is a witness on behalf of his British publisher, Random House U.K., in a copyright case, said that when he came up with the idea for ""The Da Vinci Code,"" he had not yet read ""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,"" a 1982 nonfiction book. Two of the three authors of that book, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, are suing Random House U.K., saying that Mr. Brown stole crucial themes about a conspiracy to protect the secret of Jesus' bloodline. Mr. Brown testified that the absence of ""Holy Blood"" from the bibliography for an early synopsis of ""The Da Vinci Code"" showed that he had not relied on it for his book's premise or basic structure. At times during the trial yesterday Mr. Brown, who rarely makes public appearances, struggled to remain polite and calm in the face of abstruse questioning. SARAH LYALL",2006-03-15T05:00:00+0000

(""Two and a Half Men"" was shown in between, and had 17.56 million viewers.) But NBC and Fox also had reason to be happy. NBC's game show ""Deal or No Deal"" easily won the 8 p.m. hour in total viewers (15.38 million) and among 18-to-49-year-olds, and lifted the network to a second-place finish over all in that age group despite its weakened ""Apprentice"" (9.91 million). And Fox's ""24,"" which featured the deaths of Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and Lynn McGill (Sean Astin), drew 13.57 million viewers, winning the 9 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49. When ""Prison Break"" returns with new episodes at 8 p.m. next Monday, Fox will present a formidable challenge to CBS in the sought-after 18-to-49 demographic. KATE AURTHUR",2006-03-15T05:00:00+0000

The museum, a complex of cathedrals and palaces near President Vladimir V. Putin's quarters, has 1.5 million visitors a year, and has been so cramped for space that much of its holdings -- including the bulk of its icon collection, for example -- cannot be displayed. The museum's bicentennial began with a ceremony last week attended by Mr. Putin that displayed some of the restoration work that has already been completed, including 15th-century frescoes in the Annunciation Cathedral.

The Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University mourns the loss of our esteemed colleague who passed away on March 8, 2006. Ray was a graduate of the NYU Medical School. In 1948 he began his life-long association with the Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center. He was Head of the Analgesic Studies Section and then Chief of the Pain Service. Ray literally developed the field of the clinical pharmacology of opioid analgesics. He developed the tools to measure subjective responses like pain and pain relief that are now routinely used in adult and pediatric pain patients. His table of relative analgesic potencies of the clinically used opioids formed the basis for dose conversion tables that are used throughout the world and are found in virtually every Pharmacology text. Ray was a member of the Department of Pharmacology since the 1950's and taught in the medical pharmacology course for many years. He was a founding member of the International Association for the Study of Pain, the American Pain Society and the Eastern Pain Association and the recipient of many awards for his contributions to our understanding analgesic drugs and their appropriate use in the management of pain.

""When the President Talks to God"" by Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst is one of the era's more biting anti-Bush anthems. Chuck D, representing the pop left's small hip-hop wing, has recently had a hard time linking his trademark righteous rage to compelling music.

The companies also said that Epic artists, including the singer Natasha Bedingfield, left, would play games against users over the network. As Microsoft tries to expand its foothold in the gaming market, Xbox Live has emerged as perhaps its most important weapon because its Japanese rivals -- Nintendo and Sony -- offer no similar service. So in addition to delivering worldwide gameplay, Microsoft has been offering additional video programming, like movie trailers, over the service. Later this year, Microsoft may offer a more extensive iTunes-like service that will allow Xbox 360 users to download full music tracks to the machine's hard drive. Microsoft's game unit is also trying to move into television.

Over the next decade, he created full-figure portraits of people, alone or in couples, that were as intimate as they were monumental and as poetically thrilling as they were visually lucid.

us,The Listings: March 17 - March 23; EUGENE ANDOLSEK: 'KALEIDOSCOPIC VISIONARY DRAWINGS',"In 1953 Eugene Andolsek began to draw in the evenings at his kitchen table partly to relieve the persistent anxiety that he was going to be fired from his job as an office worker, and he continued to do so for the next 50 years. He never thought of his hair-raisingly beautiful drawings as serious art, but he did save them in trunks. Recently, an attendant in the assisted-living center in western Pennsylvania where Mr. Andolsek now lives discovered his drawings, of which there are thousands. Then a series of fortuitous connections brought them to the attention of Brooke Davis Anderson, a curator at the American Folk Art Museum, and she put some in ""Obsessive Drawing,"" an exhibition that remains on view at the museum through Sunday. Another display of Mr. Andolsek's work at the American Primitive Gallery is his first solo show. Mr. Andolsek, who no longer draws because of failing eyesight, worked on graph paper using rulers, compasses and black ink to generate linear patterns, which he then colored in with store-bought inks that he mixed to achieve nonstandard hues. The finished drawings (an example is above) variously resemble Asian mandalas, stained-glass windows, Oriental carpets, Victorian wallpaper, needlepoint and psychedelic abstractions. The drawings pack an immediate revelatory punch and then become hypnotically absorbing to study at length. You may sense something mystical in them, as if Mr. Andolsek had tapped into deep structures of consciousness. He was a humble alchemist who turned ink and paper into visionary gold. (American Primitive Gallery, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1530, through April 12.)",2006-03-17T05:00:00+0000
us,The Listings: March 17 - March 23; DANCEOFF!,"Showcases for emerging choreographers are always chancy affairs. But Terry Dean Bartlett, co-curator of Danceoff!, is pretty confident that audiences will walk away satisfied. The series, which was born at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and has come to various theaters throughout the city, seeks to maintain a theatrical, cabaret-style aesthetic that Mr. Bartlett feels is missing from many experimental downtown performances. As Mr. Bartlett (who is also a member of the troupe Streb) sees it, serious and entertaining do not have to be mutually exclusive concepts. ""I'm not a fan of dance that's treacly and pandering -- I hate that just as much as 'I'm just going to have feedback for music, not spend any time on choreography, I'm so experimental!' dance,"" said Mr. Bartlett (above with Katie Workum, the series co-curator). This session's roster includes work by Jonah Bokaer, a Merce Cunningham dancer who is working with motion-capture technology to combine film and live performance; Cynthia Hopkins, a 2005 Bessie Award recipient, who will present a work-in-progress excerpt from ""Tsimtsum,"" which can be seen in its entirety at Dance Theater Workshop in April as part of the ""Sourcing Stravinsky"" program; Will Rawls, an elegant, captivating dancer who is worth watching no matter what he's doing; and others. For the choreographers, it's a chance to present short pieces in a relaxed workshop setting. And audiences can get a sneak peek at things to come, with the knowledge that, even if one dance is a stinker, it's only seven minutes long.

On Sunday, the Frick introduces Richard Egarr, a British harpsichordist who will make his New York debut playing Bach's ""Goldberg"" Variations. Mr. Egarr, above, plays music from the 15th century to the present, but thanks to an enormous and quickly proliferating discography, he is becoming known best for his thoughtful, inventive performances of Baroque works, as both a soloist and an ensemble player. A recent recording of the Bach Concertos, with Andrew Manze and the Academy of Ancient Music, on the Harmonia Mundi label, was richly endowed with fresh phrasing ideas and an irresistible energy, as were collaborations with Mr. Manze on the Biber ""Rosary"" Sonatas and works by Corelli and Handel. Mr. Egarr's latest recording, also for Harmonia Mundi, is an involving traversal of the work he is playing on Sunday, the Bach ""Goldbergs,"" along with the 14 ""Goldberg"" Canons that were discovered in 1974. A firm believer that this music was tailor-made for the harpsichord, however compelling it may sound on the piano, Mr. Egarr produces a rich sound that sings in the slow variations and roars in the brisker, more forceful ones. This breadth of tone is a good thing: he takes every last variation in his 90-minute account, but the work seems to zip by in no time.

That was when Marion True, a curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, went on trial in Italy on charges of trafficking in looted antiquities, along with Robert Hecht, a dealer who has sold many ancient objects to the Museum of Fine Arts. Although the Boston museum was not named in the case, documents in the trial listed more than 30 objects in its collection as evidence, and Italian prosecutors said they had been illegally removed. Ms. Griffin said the Italian government had as yet made no formal claims against the museum. ""Absolutely no information has been given to us about what objects are in question, and there's no outline for discussions right now,"" she said. ""So we're really looking at this as an opportunity to go listen.""

Bell, co-chairman at the troubled Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, is retiring, Interpublic said yesterday, and will take the post of chairman emeritus, serving as a consultant. The other co-chairman, Michael I. Roth, left, will become the sole chairman while continuing as chief executive. The shift came as Mr. Bell's most recent one-year contract with Interpublic expired. Mr. Bell, 62, gave up the post of chief executive to Mr. Roth in January 2005 after two years. He became chief executive as Interpublic sought to address operational and financial problems that began in 2002. Mr. Bell joined Interpublic, which owns agencies like Campbell-Ewald and Deutsch, in 2001 as vice chairman, when the agency company where he was chief executive, True North Communications, was acquired by Interpublic. Mr. Bell has spent 39 years in advertising. STUART ELLIOTT (NYT) BUSINESS BRIEFS",2006-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Early on, he learned firsthand the rudiments of international business from his Canadian father, Frederick C. Moore, who joined the fledgling General Motors Corporation during its formative years. Mr. Moore retired from a career that spanned four decades of successfully resolving a wide variety of public relations challenges. During his career at Eaton Corporation, he pioneered the broad multinational corporate approach to doing business when he spearheaded the corporate communications staff. In 1971, Moore edited PR Quarterly's two issue special on multinationalism --then a brand new word coined by Business Week. He later established Moore & Company, whose clients included Prudential-Bache Securities, Brunschwig et Fils and numerous non-profit foundations. His love of history and antiques manifested itself in his last endeavour, Moore & Company Antiques.

""Each year, I organize a trip for a group of friends, and we go someplace different, mixing a few days of physical activity with a place that's culturally interesting. We were surprised at how long it took to hike to the monastery. At first, it seemed far. Then it suddenly seemed to be quite close, and we thought we were nearly there, before realizing, 'No, we still have another hour.' It was impressive that people had been climbing up there to pray since the eighth or ninth century, according to what they told us. And, in visiting the inside of all those little chapels, we discovered at once the richness of the decoration and the intensity of those praying, who seemed completely enchanted by this mythic space.

Swanson's ""Manhunt,"" about the search for Lincoln's assassin, continue to move serious units -- Grogan's book is No. 1 on the hardcover nonfiction list for the sixth consecutive week, and Swanson's is No. 4. Careful students of the best-seller list won't be surprised: dog books and Lincoln books are longtime regulars on this page. (Asked to come up with a surefire best-seller title, the Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf is said to have replied: ""Lincoln's Doctor's Dog."") As it happens, the Book Review hasn't reviewed Grogan's book, or Swanson's. Why not? The long answer: Both books were read carefully by editors here, and their merits were weighed against the hundreds of other books we receive each month. The short answer: We get a lot of books about dogs and Lincoln. I finally bought a copy of ""Marley & Me"" last week, not long after my son's puppy ate, in two sickening gulps, the decomposed body of a car-flattened squirrel. (I wanted to see if Marley could top that -- the answer, basically, is yep.) The prose in Grogan's book is as friendly and as sloppy -- and, ultimately, as annoying -- as a golden retriever who won't get his head out of your lap. It's easy to see why some of Grogan's colleagues at The Philadelphia Inquirer, where he is a columnist, are puzzled about, and envious of, his success. (Philadelphia magazine recently printed a story about Grogan filled with mean, and unattributed, comments from his co-workers about his ""cutesy-poo"" writing.) Grogan is having the last laugh, however.

Her grandfather, Seligman, a banker, helped the Union cause and raised funds selling bonds to Great Britain. Ulysses S. Grant, upon his ascendancy to President of the United States, requested her grandfather to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He declined. Eve traveled with an acting group performing Noel Coward plays touring both Connecticut and New York which horrified her grandfather prompting him to hire detectives to bring her home. Born in New York City, she attended Brearley in NY, later transferred to Swiss schools; spent four years in Paris, graduated, thereafter studied art in Paris, Venice, and Florence, Italy, studying at the Pitti and the Uffizi Galleries daily. Her father in the late 20's bought a villa in Cannes. Eve served as a hostess. Following World War II she worked processing American soldiers. Her primary interest was psychology and mental health. She moved to Topeka, KS, met psychiatrist Professor Karl Menninger, admired him and attended classes for psychiatrists.

She was a well known shoe designer in New York in the 60s. As a painter, she showed at Betty Parsons and the Bodley galleries.

After retiring in 1994, Dorianne made Europe her home but traveled often to Coconut Grove and her beloved New York. Dorianne used her impeccable taste to design and decorate the Portes des Iris, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and beautiful conference and banqueting centers.

That explains, sort of, why a nine-inch plastic doll that flies is the one item I cannot leave home without. Sky Dancer, replete with aqua-blue hair, is a true citizen of the world. Conceived in San Francisco, she hails from China, and her brown skin reflects her African heritage. She is a global ambassador, a twirling metaphor, a charmer of children worldwide. She was given to me years ago as I started Adventure Divas, an enterprise that began my career as a documentary filmmaker. She has since made a cameo appearance in every Divas film: she parted the Ganges River along with several other deities at a Hindu festival. She spun above the ruins of Persepolis in Iran. She traveled through the desolate Sahara with the fabled blue men of the desert. She mushed a pack of dogs across the Arctic and inspired me as I struggled up the Matterhorn. Several years ago, she landed on the Dangerous Dozen toy list put out by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The report said that she can ""fly rapidly in unpredictable directions, and can hit and injure."" Haven't kids been flinging pointy objects into the air since time began? Or, as Sky Dancer might say, ""Strong women have always been vilified by the patriarchy."" She has since been re-released, but now she cannot fly as high.

Tolkien's ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" is opening on Friday, at the Princess of Wales Theater, amid a swirl of press-office-generated statistics that bring to mind the publicity that surrounded Cecil B. DeMille epics. (A computer-controlled stage floor weighing 40 tons! 504 costumes, using more than 5,000 yards of fabric! 404 pairs of shoes and boots for the hobbits, dwarves, elves and ents!) Certainly, the creative team is as international as that of any gladiator movie of yore. The Indian composer A. R. RAHMAN and the Finnish pop band VARTTINA have composed the score in collaboration with CHRISTOPHER NIGHTINGALE (of London). The director, MATTHEW WARCHUS, is British and, strangely enough, best known on this side of the Atlantic for his minimalist productions of ""Art,"" ""True West"" and ""Follies."" Be assured that Tolkien fanatics and speakers of Elvish will be out in force, eyes peeled for instances of heresy. Crazy, huh? Next thing you know there'll be a movie version.

Officials have also hired a child welfare expert to train staff members on abuse reporting requirements and have improved reporting protocols with the authorities, said Jimmy M. Lago, chancellor of the archdiocese. A committee has also been appointed to help enact recommendations made in two independent audits. An audit conducted by a forensic investigation firm said a lack of communication among archdiocese departments had been the most significant failure in the handling of recent sexual abuse accusations against two priests.

A jury determined that the title song of the album, ""Ready to Die"" (1994), included an unauthorized snippet of an Ohio Players tune. The move by Judge Todd J. Campbell of United States District Court in Nashville would freeze sales of one of rap's seminal albums -- it has sold about 3.3 million copies since its release -- though it was not clear when the ban would take effect. The decision came as a jury on Friday awarded $4.2 million in damages to the two companies that control the Ohio Players' recordings, Bridgeport Music and Westbound Records. The jury found that the Notorious B.I.G.'s label, Bad Boy Entertainment, improperly used a portion of the song ""Singing in the Morning."" Bridgeport and Westbound, which also control the music of the pioneering funk group Funkadelic, have filed hundreds of lawsuits to collect royalties over unauthorized samples. Bridgeport's effort began five years ago, after it won a dispute with the former Funkadelic leader, George Clinton, over copyright of the group's songs. In a separate case last year, Mr. Clinton won ownership of the master recordings of four of the group's albums from the 1970's and 80's. JEFF LEEDS",2006-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Schwartz. In 1990, together with Dr. Arnold Pfeffer, he took the revolutionary step of forming an interdisciplinary seminar in which psychoanalysts discussed with neuroscientists (their historical archrivals) what they had learned about the workings of the mind. This would not have been possible had it not been for Dr. Schwartz's impeccable scientific credentials and the wide network of authorities that he could count as personal friends. In due course, he made them friends of psychoanalysis too. His efforts culminated in the establishment of the vibrant International Neuro-Psychoanalysis Society and its journal Neuro-Psychoanalysis, on whose editorial board he sat since its inception in 1999. The interdisciplinary seminar that he started still continues in the form of a monthly public lecture at the Arnold Pfeffer Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Our warmest sympathy to his family. Mark Solms, Ph.D., Director Arnold Pfeffer Center NY Psychoanalytic Institute",2006-03-21T05:00:00+0000

But the average for domestic flights edged up 3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, as oil prices stayed high and carriers cut domestic capacity. This year, Mr. McGraw said, ""corporate travel buyers will face a tough negotiating environment across the board,"" as prices rise for air travel, hotels and rental cars. The average negotiated first-class round-trip fare on 160 major international routes tracked by the American Express Business Travel Monitor was $11,610, up 4 percent, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The average negotiated round-trip business-class fare rose 5 percent, to $7,824, and for coach fares, the average rose 9 percent, to $2,226, American Express said.",2006-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Warns Of City's Air Quality,"People who live near congested highways and in large cities like New York face an increased risk of getting cancer from air pollution, according to a national study by the Environmental Protection Agency. The study was based on 1999 data, the most recent year available, and covers 177 toxins. But the study was criticized for excluding dioxins and the parts of diesel exhaust that are believed to cause cancer. Of all the states, New York has the most hazardous air, according to the study, and New York City has the most polluted air in the state. The agency said the study results should not be used to make state-by-state or city-by-city comparisons. Rather, like the results of an earlier study in 2002, they are intended to help state efforts to concentrate on and reduce pollutants. ANTHONY DEPALMA (NYT)",2006-03-23T05:00:00+0000

But there are a few ways in which Mr. Rava, above, does suggest Davis, who sparked his interest in the trumpet nearly 50 years ago. In addition to Mr. Rava's clear and melancholy tone, there's his presence: in Italy, he is not only the pre-eminent jazz musician but also part of the popular culture. More meaningfully, he has embraced the Milesian practice of absorbing younger talent into his ensembles, including the quintet he has led for the last six years. Introducing that group on a 2004 album, ""Easy Living"" (ECM), Mr. Rava spotlighted a pair of rising stars, the trombonist Gianluca Petrella (who has since released a noteworthy Blue Note album) and the pianist Stefano Bollani (who recently left the quintet to tend to a solo career); at the Montreal Jazz Festival last summer, he additionally showcased Francesco Cafiso, an alto saxophonist in his teens. Small wonder that Mr. Rava's influence will pervade a festival of Italian jazz at Birdland next week. His quintet appears on Thursday and next Friday, along with the pianist Enrico Pieranunzi (in a trio with the bassist Marc Johnson and the drummer Paul Motian, both Americans). Tuesday and Wednesday's program features ensembles led by the pianist Dado Moroni and the bassist Giovanni Tommaso, both close associates of Mr. Rava. And on April 1 and 2, Mr. Bollani and Mr. Cafiso will split the bill, leaving Mr. Rava's trumpet out of the mix but no doubt conveying some of his spirit.

Dr. Houde served at MSKCC for more than 50 years and was recognized as an international authority on evaluation of drugs for pain relief. He pioneered the development and use of methods to assess pain and drug therapy for patients with cancer and was one of the first to investigate the sites of action, potency, and efficacy of morphine and other analgesics in patients with pain. The methods he and his MSKCC colleagues developed continue to serve as models for evaluating the efficacy of new analgesics and for measuring patients' differing sensitivity and tolerance to these drugs. His many awards include the 1992 Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Pain Research. We extend our condolences to his family. Robert E. Wittes Physician-in-Chief Lisa M.

There she met a U.S. Naval Attache, Wesley Hargrett, who arranged for her return to America by Clipper. They met again after the war and were married. Hargrett adopted Teddy's son who took the name Gregor J. Hargrett. Gregor J. died in 1989. Teddy is survived by her adopted daughter, Gabriela M.

She would be a great asset in a terrible play -- resourceful actors always are -- but it just so happens that this tall, blue-eyed performer has a pretty good record downtown. To cite two of her more memorable turns, she found the quiet desperation and dark humor in the character of a writer in limbo in Melissa James Gibson's ""[sic]"" and proved that she could be a classical ingnue in the revival of the 1930's Kaufman and Ferber play ""Stage Door."" Followers of the Off Off Broadway theater scene have known about her talent for years, but in Lisa Kron's ""Well,"" Broadway audiences are finally getting a chance to see her in a small role, which, as usual, she makes the most of. In this play within a play (or ""theatrical exploration,"" as Ms. Kron calls it), Ms. Kirk (third from left) is a joyless woman named Joy, adopting a concave posture and hooded eyelids, the picture of ill health. If you thought your grandmother was passive-aggressive, you haven't seen this woman, who shares a room in the allergy ward with a young Ms. Kron, whom she seems to resent for not being quite allergic enough.

Judge Rachel N. Davidson of Essex County Superior Court ruled that it was proper for the city to bypass the city treasury and use money from a settlement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to finance the arena's construction. Newark has earmarked more than $200 million of that money to pay off, over 35 years, bonds that were issued for the city's share of the $310 million arena, which will be the home of the New Jersey Devils.

He served as an active member of the Board of Directors from 1948 until his death--providing extraordinary vision, leadership and support for every aspect of the School. He chaired the Board from 1965 to 1992. Moreover, he represented the School throughout the independent secondary school community and was instrumental in the founding of the Independent School Chairman's Association. In 1947--following World War II, when the School was closed and the property used as an army convalescent hospital--Reed Estabrook was joined by a small group of alumni and friends, who worked to reassemble a faculty, staff and student body to reopen the Old Farms campus. His remarkable endeavors and deep passion for the School during the next six decades helped position Avon Old Farms as one of America's great secondary schools.

""Because of the political content,"" she said in an e-mail message. ""The music became a driving force in the civil rights and the peace movements, and a liberating influence on an entire generation."" She's a fan of hip-hop, too, though with one crucial reservation. ""I like the beat and fervor,"" she said, ""but not the misogyny. Many hip-hop (and rock) artists denounce the war abroad while actively participating in the one at home.""

The book Smiley was selling is called ""The Covenant With Black America"" (Third World Press), and it is indeed on this week's list -- it enters the paperback nonfiction rankings at No. 6. The book, which Smiley edited, is a data-packed manifesto about racial inequality in America circa 2006, with chapters on topics like health care and the justice system. ""The Covenant With Black America"" didn't make this list without some hard, and canny, work on Smiley's part -- he sold the book during a barnstorming 10-city tour, on which he was sometimes accompanied by the Princeton professor Cornel West, and he hopes African-American churches will push the book to their congregations, a strategy that worked for Rick Warren, the author of ""The Purpose-Driven Life."" Smiley and West recently made a somewhat surreal appearance on Fox News's ""Hannity & Colmes."" Alan Colmes warned early on that Sean Hannity was going to blow his lid. (""He's going to yell and scream about Harry Belafonte,"" Colmes said.) West called Hannity ""brother Sean,"" but that didn't mellow things out. ""The reason why black people do not support conservatives like you, my dear brother,"" West said, ""is because your argument's not convincing when it comes to focusing on working and poor people.""",2006-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,'Great Pretenders'," On an early spring day in 1998, I sat in a coach window seat of a descending American Airlines flight, panicking. Below me, the sun-bleached whiteness of the Los Angeles basin loomed closer and closer. I was due to land in twenty-eight minutes, yet I had no idea where I was going. I had no compass, no direction, no guidebook. My destination wasn't on any map; I wasn't even sure if it really existed. I had been to L.A. many times in the past, always with a purpose, always with my expenses paid. I had traveled as a journalist for newspapers and magazines, on assignment to write celebrity profiles and interview musicians. I always knew exactly where to go, and when. Publicists took care of everything. This was different. This time I was writing a book; I was on my own, flying under no prestigious banner, with no one to look out for me. It all seemed like a terrible mistake. I wanted to hit the call button and tell the flight attendant, Help me! I wanted to run up the aisle to the cockpit and instruct the pilots to turn the plane around and put me back on the ground in New York, where I would be safe. I pressed my nose against the window and breathed uneasily. It's not that I've never felt this scared before, I said to myself. It's that I've never felt this stupid. ",2006-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   ASHER, MARK G.","ASHER--Mark G. Highly awarded Washington Post Sports Reporter 1945-2006 A Family's Memories. He started every day by asking his daughters ""Are you doing what is right in your heart?"" and he lived his life the same way. To their replies, he never said ""What I would have done if I were you..."" believing that people never get to be anybody but who they are. Those who couldn't see past Mark's physical condition no doubt wondered how he unfailingly answered ""Great!"" (with a big smile) when asked ""How are you?"" But the explanation was simple: Mark only wanted people to see through his less-than-healthy body to the healthy, vibrant presence inside. In turn, Mark gave what he wanted: acceptance. When a companion reacted negatively to two men holding hands, Mark replied ""Isn't it wonderful that we're in America where they can do that in public?"" And when he couldn't make his points gently, Mark battled. Society's treatment of people with disabilities and other inequities became his causes. His love for life showed in his love for food. If he hadn't been a sports reporter, Mark would have wanted to be a food critic. There was hardly a restaurant he hadn't visited. During his last days, when Mark couldn't drink or eat and his family told him they could not enjoy eating, he said, ""Eat all the foods that I love for me and that will make me happy."" Mark won numerous awards from the Associated Press Sports Editors Association: 1983 -1st Place, Best News Story; 1985 -5th Place, Best Enterprise Reporting; 1986 -2nd Place, Best Enterprise Reporting; 1986 -2nd Place, Best Investigative Reporting; 1990 -Best Sports News Story; and 1996 -4th Place, Best Enterprise Reporting. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1986, won the 1990 Associated Press's Chesapeake Mark Twain Award for Outstanding Achievement in sports coverage, the 1997 Society of Professional Journalists' Washington Dateline Award for Excellence in Local Journalism, and the 2002 U.S. Basketball Writers Association's Katha Quinn Award. He was a Washington Post Duke University Fellow from 1989-90. NBA Commissioner David Stern once called Mark ""The Murray Chass of the Washington Post."" The last few years of Mark's professional life were difficult. While grateful for the support of those who knew what he could still do, Mark felt the Post's changing culture brought in some people who only saw his disabilities. But to the end, as his beloved daughters, Lizzie and Melanie, and devoted wife, Elizabeth, fondly recall, Mark still replied to some of their calls with the classic reporter's line: ""I have to call you back. I'm on deadline."" Mark reluctantly retired on November 1, 2005. Asked by his children when he would have wanted to retire, Mark replied ""I would like to have died in the newsroom.""

It weighs several pounds. You are not likely to carry it to the beach. When you open it up and start reading, you encounter a dense prose style, with lengthy sentences, ambitious metaphors, and little discernible plot. It appears to describe, in great detail, a bygone world: French society of the early twentieth century. For these reasons, you might well imagine that this book-whatever fame may be ascribed to it-is likely to be an arduous read, a massive project devoted to distant things, an impersonal act of labor.

The guardians ($125 at Roberta Freymann in New York, 212-585-3767) are available in two breeds: the dragon charm is said to promote harmony and lend protection and power; the fish charm (the sellout model) summons fertility, love and passion.

The film, which stars Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodi Foster, is the best opener ever for Mr. Washington, whose most recent No. 1 film, ""Man on Fire,"" opened with $22.7 million in April 2004, as well as for Mr. Lee, below, whose documentary ""Original Kings of Comedy"" had his previous best first week with $11.6 million in August 2000. ""V for Vendetta"" (Warner Brothers), starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving as freedom fighters in a futuristic Britain, was No. 1 last week but dropped sharply to take in only $12.3 million, bringing its gross revenues to $46.2 million. The other new film in wide release, ""Stay Alive"" (Buena Vista), which is set in New Orleans and features a deadly video game, opened at No. 3 with an estimated $11.2 million. Two holdovers in their third week of release rounded out the top five: ""Failure to Launch"" (Paramount) dropped to No. 4 with $10.8 million, bringing its cumulative take to $63.8 million, and ""The Shaggy Dog"" (Buena Vista) was at No. 5 with $9.1 million, for total sales of $47.9 million.

In an interview, Mr. Menon said that all 10 double-deck A380's that Singapore has ordered will be configured with about 475 seats in first class, business class and economy cabins. Most of the 12 other airlines that have ordered the jets -- none of them United States carriers -- have said they will fly their A380's with about 550 seats, though the plane can seat nearly 900 in an all-coach configuration. The first service will be on one of the airline's signature long-haul routes, Singapore to Sydney, Australia, with a London route to follow as more planes come into service, Mr. Menon said. In September, Singapore will unveil an A380 cabin design that stresses ""convenience and comfort, as well as an enhanced ability to do some of the things people need to do on long-haul travel, like work, relax, sleep and get in shape,"" he said, adding, ""We want to emphasize the space."" The new business- and first-class seats will be introduced around the time British Airways is expected to announce details of a $170 million makeover of its own premium-class flat-bed seats. Singapore has not set a date for starting A380 service to and from the United States, but Mr. Menon said the carrier was looking more closely at using San Francisco International Airport, which has made the necessary modifications to accommodate the giant jet.",2006-03-28T05:00:00+0000

Edward G. Rendell announced yesterday. The foundation, home to a world-class collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, has been at the center of legal battles and financial difficulties for years. In 2004 a Philadelphia judge ruled that the foundation, backed by pledges of $150 million in financial support primarily from three Philadelphia-area foundations, could move downtown, where more people could see the art. The decision went against the charter and bylaws drawn up by the collection's mercurial founder, Albert C. Barnes, left, who famously stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or even moved on the walls of the neo-Classical galleries that he had built for it in the mid-1920's. In a statement, Governor Rendell said that the money, which will come from a state fund for capital projects, would be ""as important to the continued development of Philadelphia's downtown as any in recent years."" But former students who have consistently opposed the move stood firm. ""If they'd given us the $25 million in the first place, the Barnes would never have had to move,"" said Nicholas Tinari, a former Barnes student. CAROL VOGEL",2006-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The acclaimed family drama, which may be a casualty of the merger between UPN and WB, delivered an average of 3.52 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m. That was more than UPN's lineup attracted (3.16 million), but the two networks tied in the 18-to-34 demographic the merged network, CW, will aim at next season.

The enforcement required the club to arrange a series of hand-offs between towing companies at the city line, club officials said. Gabriel Taussig, a lawyer for the city, said the licensing rules allowed the city to perform criminal background checks on tow truck drivers, which helped protect city residents. He said out-of-city companies could obtain medallions to operate in the city.

Critchlow, a historian from Mrs. Schlafly's hometown, St. Louis, conducted his research in archives.

Though several of his albums have reached the top of the Billboard chart, none until ""3121"" (Universal), released last week, did so on their first week in stores. Prince's success is even more surprising given that ""3121"" is not available as a download on iTunes (an increasingly important sales engine), and that with 183,000 copies purchased, according to Nielsen SoundScan, it actually sold slightly fewer copies in its first week than his last CD, ""Musicology,"" which opened at No. 3 in 2004. In other debuts this week, the rapper B.G. opened at No. 6 with ""The Heart of tha Streetz, Vol. 2: I Am What I Am"" (Koch), Ben Harper reached No. 7 with ""Both Sides of the Gun"" (Virgin) and Teddy Geiger is at No. 8 with ""Underage Thinking"" (Columbia). The ""High School Musical"" soundtrack (Disney) is at No. 2 with sales of 152,000 copies, and the British crooner James Blunt sold 111,000 copies of ""Back to Bedlam"" (Atlantic) to reach No. 3. Barry Manilow's appearance on ""American Idol"" last week gave his ""Greatest Songs of the Fifties"" (Arista) a big boost: it jumped 20 spots to No. 4, with 78,000 sales.

On ""Idol,"" the theme was songs from the 21st century. Most of the performers were roundly criticized by the judges -- yes, even by Paula Abdul, the nice judge. An audience of 31.48 million tuned in, and of the 18-to-49-year-olds who watched television between 8 and 9 p.m., 32 percent chose ""Idol."" Those ratings continued the talent competition's streak of double-digit growth in comparison with last year's telecasts. Fox's ""House"" also won its hour in dominant fashion, with 21.51 million viewers at 9 p.m. In that slot, the CBS action series ""The Unit"" brought in 15.9 million viewers, placing second to ""House""; it is this season's most-watched new show so far. Also of note, the good news for NBC was that its new sitcom, ""Teachers,"" drew 6.7 million viewers and retained most of the ""Scrubs"" audience (6.8 million).

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  SILVESTRE, PATRICIA ANN","SILVESTRE--Patricia Ann. Born in New York City, NY on June 13, 1936, daughter of Mary Elizabeth Lydon and Alphonse Michael Silvestre. Pat lived in the Bronx with her mom and her first job was a line girl at Horn & Hardart Cafeteria. Knowing this would not suffice, she convinced the family patriarch, her grandfather Nicholas Silvestro, to allow her to join the 1st Sergeants Program for Army Nurses in New York State, so she could attend school. Succeeding in her quest she went to Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing and graduated in 1958. Pat's thirst for knowledge never stopped. She received a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Columbia and a Master's in Hospital Administration from Baylor. Her military education: Army Medical Department Officer Advanced Course, Department of the Army Inspector General Course, (Pat was the 1st female placed on the I.G. team) and the Chief Nurse Orientation Course. Upon retirement, she became an Instructor at the American Red Cross. During her Army career, she held a variety of clinical, administrative and staff positions: Madigan, the 121st Evac. in Seoul, Korea, Fort Gordon, Fort Jay, a tour at the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, the office of the Surgeon General as Assistant Chief for the Army Nurse Corps Procurement, Surgical Hospital, Quang Tri, the 95th Evacuation Hospital Republic of Vietnam, Inspector General U.S. Army Health Services Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Campbell, the Army Regional Medical Center in Frankfurt, Germany and Fitzsimmons in Colorado. She was the youngest Colonel in the Army. Pat's army career ended with her retirement on September 25, 1986. However, her new life of retirement in San Antonio, TX began anew with an old life long motto of serving others. She started at the SAMM Shelter volunteering for the night shift in downtown San Antonio. She became an active field worker for the Red Cross and when mobility became a problem she became an instructor. She became a vital member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, where she used her skills and character for many years to benefit those who needed a helping hand. As a member of her church she served as a CCD instructor, lector, and Parish Council. She remained an active member of Kiwanis, Veteran's of Foreign Wars and the Women's Overseas Service League for as long as her health permitted. Paraphrasing M. Rausch's words about Colonel Silvestre, ""What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. You have left a trail of excellence as exhibited by your family, friends, and colleagues and the future holds great promise; however it is what lies within you which has touched 'The Body of Christ.""' Alfred Adler, one of the fathers of modern psychiatry, said one of the dominant impulses that every human being is born with is the instinct to get ahead. The problem arises whether one is willing to channel it for good. Christ said that in the Kingdom of God greatness is measured in terms of service. And you my friend have accomplished that level of excellence because you were always ready to the cries of those in need. Your service has cost you through the years to bleed and suffer knowing the price for greatness is long hours and many sleepless nights. There is another quote which puts you in mind. ""You Pat, are a very special individual who at all times and every where gave her strength to the weak, her substance to the poor, her sympathy to the suffering, and her heart to God. The endless number of people who have crossed your path will bear witness to this. When a void existed you were ready to step in and serve with honor and humility. It is yourcommitment in ministering to others which has touched us all."" Colonel Silvestre's awards and recognitions are too numerous to mention. Colonel Patricia Ann Silvestre passed away at the Army Retirement Community in San Antonio, TX on March 12, 2006. She leaves behind dear friends, colleagues, cousins Nancy Guerin, Dorothy Lyons, Michael Guerin, their families, and her sister, Marietta.",2006-03-30T05:00:00+0000

Jean had a zest for life and leaves a legacy of wisdom, of strong conviction and of resolute character. She always cared and taught by example that life could be a blend of social concern and glamorous fun. She is survived by her daughters Felicia W. Rogan of Charlottesville, VA and Jill W. Cartter of Beverly Hills, CA. She was also the beloved friend and quintessential aunt of Bobbie Adler Katzander of New York City. No services are to be held.

As part of his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, he returns with the orchestra for two programs this weekend, including tonight's performance of ""Cassandre"" by the noted Swiss composer Michael Jarrell, based on a contemporary reimagining of the ancient myth. (The actress Barbara Sukowa -- of early Fassbinder fame -- declaims the text over a chamber orchestra studded with synthesizers.) Tomorrow, Mr. Robertson, recently decorated for his commitment to American music, will lead John Adams's moving 9/11 memorial piece, ""On the Transmigration of Souls."" The work was written less than a year after the attack and conceived as a ""memory space"" that includes lists of victims' names, samples of urban noise and a children's choir. It should be fascinating to see how the piece ages as the national memory of the tragedy itself continues to shift. (At least Mr. Adams's memorial has been realized, unlike most other projects connected to ground zero.) Brahms's ""German Requiem"" fills out the program on a somber note.

But their countrymen, Art Brut, are just as jumpily funny in their skewering of the rock-star preening among the hip, gallery-crawling set. The gleeful satire ""Formed a Band"" finds a sweet spot between poseur narcissism and the thrill of genuine musical creation. With a talk-sing delivery over his band's jaunty guitar blurts and swells of bashed bravado, the frontman Eddie Argos (above left, with Jasper Future) boasts a vocal tone more empathetic than the sneer of Johnny Rotten but testier than the party-rallying of the B-52's Fred Schneider. Art Brut's snooty name recalls an outsider art movement, and songs like the mash note ""Emily Kane"" happily crib from the romantic playbook of the star-crossed but always optimistic outsider artist and hit parade dreamer Jad Fair. ""Emily Kane"" imagines a world in which the subject of unrequited love might change her fickle mind when she receives the ultimate pop gift: being the central figure in a hit song. Mr. Argos swoons at the thought of such a song, as he promises the choosy Ms. Kane, ""schoolkids on buses singing your name.""

James Sewell went straight to Home Depot in Minneapolis, where his company is based, and bought a chainsaw and a power drill for his new ""Guy Noir: The Ballet"" (above, Benjamin Johnson, one of the dancers). ""For years I've been wanting to do a ballet with a chainsaw,"" Mr. Sewell said. Guy Noir is a cigar-chomping radio detective created by Garrison Keillor, who wrote the ballet's script and narrates it on tape. The story involves a deadly dance contest at the ACME Tulle Company, and the plot unfolds to a jazz score that includes music by the Guy's All-Star Shoe Band. (The program also includes ""Involution,"" set to music by Thomas Newman, and ""Anagram,"" an improvisatory ballet set to Schubert.) Mr. Sewell, who trained at the School of American Ballet and performed with Eliot Feld, had wanted to do a Keillor ballet. Then, a few years ago, he got the perfect entree when the writer asked him to choreograph a can-can dance for men in tuxedos and sneakers for a gala for the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The kickline included Mr. Keillor. What kind of dancer was he? ""He's very tall,"" Mr. Sewell said. ""A great big guy. He had complete commitment."" Pause. ""He didn't screw up."" Mr. Sewell and his wife, Sally Rousse, left New York in 1993, taking their company with them. What has Minneapolis got that New York doesn't? ""My 15 years in New York were not replaceable,"" he said. ""But I got to the point where I wanted to do my work with the least resistance. In New York, you need 20 to 50 percent more energy to get to base level, and 70 percent more energy and money to raise a family. And there's a real tradition here of philanthropy and of pushing the boundaries of art forms.""

Dan Fisher, a young New York-based artist, gives expression to that idea in a series of beautiful, small graphite drawings. Each is copied from a photocopy of a magazine or textbook photograph of a well-known artist or artwork. Subjects include Robert Smithson, Sol LeWitt and Piet Mondrian, who poses in his studio in a three-piece suit. The single artwork depicted in this exhibition is Jeff Koons's stainless-steel cast of an inflatable Mylar bunny, a gleaming totem for the postmodern era (above). With the fine grid of pencil lines used in the copying process left visible, these velvety drawings are devotional works of monkish craft. But do we detect an element of satire? Mr. Fischer's pantheon is such orthodox academic fare, you can't help suspecting that he might be partly mocking the cultish worship of certain Modern and contemporary artists and their works. His drawings produce a tantalizing dialogue between idolatry and iconoclasm. (Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411, through April 15.)",2006-03-31T05:00:00+0000
