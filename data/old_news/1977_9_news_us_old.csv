""You don't have to say that,"" she counters. ""I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it,"" he wispers. Then they kiss, the strings swell and the camera very discreetly averts its eye.Amazingly enough, ""You Light Up My Life"" gets away with this kind of bushwah, and usually gets away with it in style. Joseph Brooks, who wrote, produced and directed the film, and also arranged, composed and conducted its score, has taken a number of conventtional, even cloying elements and scrambled them just enough to make things fresh and interesting, in a horrifyingly contemporary way. At its best, Mr. Brooks's film captures both the longing for and the infeasibility of romance in the world of show biz, a world so glossy that surface and substance are virtually interchangeable.""You Light Up My Life"" attempts to tell several stories at once, perhaps too many of them. Laurie, the girl (played very movingly by Didi Conn), is engaged to a stuffy, self-absorbed tennis instructor (Stephen Nathan) with whom she already seems to have a bad marriage, and part of the film is about the garish wedding they have planned. The bride and bridegroom will be hauled down the aisle inside a giant clam.Laurie's father (Joe Silver) is a borscht-belt comedian who has trained his daughter to follow in his footsteps, but during the course of the film she discovers she would be better off as a musician, the audience discovers this too, during an exceptionally touching sequence in which Laurie, having been summoned to audition for a movie that  coincidence of coincidences  is being directed by the same dazzling Lothario with whom she has had an affair, (Michael Zaslow), and she performs the title song. The number is an instant hit, and so is Laurie's unexpectedly full, throaty voice, which does not happen to be Miss Conn's own.Mr. Brooks's previous experience has been in composing orchestral-sounding commercials. (The ""You've got a lot to live, and Pepsi's got a lot to give"" was perhaps his best known). His songs have this same anthemlike sound. His experience with commercials has helped him to create, in the film's best moments, smart and talented people who have become so hopelessly adept at packaging themselves that they've lost track of what they're selling.Mr. Brooks isn't always this delicate; in fact, when he takes on the advertising business directly by parodying the ways in which commercials are made, he gets downright mean. But his film, though often too tangled and ambitious for its own good, benefits enormously from the uncommon innocence and vulnerability of Miss Conn's manner, the delightful eccentricity of her timing and the air of invincible hopefulness she brings to even the most heartbreaking of situations.""You Light Up My Life"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), perhaps because, though in only one instance, the character played by Miss Conn goes pretty far on a first date. But the rating is misleading; she really isn't that type of girl.",1977-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Peeples, is a thin, tired movie even when the screen is awash in blood.It's the conceit of this movie that Buford didn't die in a simple accident of the fancy automobile he'd bought with money received from Hollywood for rights to his life, but that the car was sabotaged by underworld figures. The movie covers rather prissily Buford's great good fortune in selling his story to the movies. It's not the sort of thing that happens to most people and it makes this man-of-the-people suddenly too special to fit in with the image created in the first picture. Maybe that's why we are never told how much money he did make, though the writers don't hesitate to speculate (lamely, I think) about the circumstances surrounding his death in 1974.The writing, direction and acting are dreadful. The only reasons to acknowledge such a film at this length are that the first two movies were so popular and also one might now hope that this is the absolute end of the merchandising of Buford Pusser.",1977-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Though founded in 1550, it lacks the physical heritage that other European cities enjoy, since the old town was destroyed by fire when the Russians seized Helsinki in the early 19th century. These apparent drawbacks only enhance the charm of a city that is almost surrounded by the Baltic. Its pastel neoclassical buildings and cobblestone streets are interspersed with flashes of bold architecture by internationally known Finns like Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto. It is Scandinaviantidy, but the leisurely pace is more akin to Oslo than to bustling Copenhagen or Stockholm. Helsinki endures discouraging spells of cold and dampness, but this is more than compensated for by its residents, who have not yet become sated with American tourists.

us,Screen: Polish Drama Better Than Its Tinsel,"KRZYSZTOF ZANUSSI, the Polish director who has been represented here by ""Family Life"" (1971) and ""Illumination"" (1973), is a serious filmmaker whose method keeps getting in the way of his concerns. His newest film, ""A Woman's Decision,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema 3, is a sensitively acted, sometimes-moving story about the emotional indecisions of the woman who has everything.It may not be an accident that the English translation of the film's Polish title dimly evokes some old Joan Crawford chestnut about a beautiful shopgirl torn between Herbert Marshall (money, glamour) and Franchot Tone (love, marriage).The alternatives faced by Mr. Zanussi's heroine, Marta (Maya Komorowska), a supposedly happily married woman and mother who is successful in her career (as an accountant) are a good deal more honest and complex than any that ever faced Joan Crawford, but the method is so prettily romantic it denies much of the emotional urgency.The photography, whenever possible, is dappled with Claude Lelouch-like reflections and the soundtrack is full of the kind of music to read a Mantovani record album's liner notes by.This is too bad since behind this fanciness there are characters of recognizable feelings and rare decency. Mostly there is Marta who, as played by Miss Komorowska, is a woman of intelligence who can cope with everyone else's problems but isas she sees itthwarted by a husband (Piotr Franczewski) absorbed by his own career and unable (or unwilling) to talk about their own difficulties.Their difficulties aren't unique. He's somewhat skeptical of her enthusiasms, proud of his position as head of the house, inclined to deal with problems by behaving as if they didn't exist. Marta, though, is a doer and a talker. When she finds herself having an affair with a man as footloose as it's possible to be in a socialist state, Maria must make her decision whether to make her break for freedom with the bohe-mian lover or stay with her husband.It isn't her decision that gives the film its poignancy but the subsidiary moments by which Marta's character is defined. These include her confrontation, as the office's union representative, with the office's boss, her washroom dialogues with her tough-minded best-friend who calls Marta's do-gooding ""self-indulgent,"" and an extremely moving sequence in which Marta calls on her terminally ill mother-in-law who, though not all that fond of Marta, warns her not to act with her husband as she thinks she should but, honestly, as she feels.Such sequences are so strong and good, as are the performances by Miss Komorowska, Mr. Franczewski and Marek Piwowski, who plays her lover, that the movie doesn't need the lush production techniques, which, like make-up on a naturally beautiful woman, obscure the film's natural resources.",1977-09-08T05:00:00+0000

It is a European city, complete with French etoiles and decorative balconies, though coated with a layer of desert sand.

Many tourists never explore the old parts of Cairo, with their narrow, winding, streets and hordes of people, still curious at the sight of westerner.

us,Film: Weak Answers To Hostage Dilemma,"BY THE BLOOD OF OTHERS"" (Par le Sang des Autres) is a 1973 French film that examines the moral questions that must be faced by anyone dealing with hostage-takingthe most agonizing of terrorist tactics because innocents are the victimsagainst which there seems to be no defense whatsoever.The film, which opened yesterday at the RKO 86th Street Twin 2 and other theaters, was directed by Marc Simenon (son of Georges) and produced by him and Mylene Demongeot, who plays a small but vivid role in the picture.The movie, set in rural France, begins with a furious, almost unbearably cruel sequence in which a young mental patient rapes and beats a woman and then takes her and her daughter hostage, demanding as their ransom the company of the most beautiful girl in the nearby village. The mayor is alerted, then the prefect, the chief of police, the doctor and the priest. How to deal with the situation? Storm the house? Find a suitably pliant prostitute? Nothing?When ""By the Blood of Others"" starts asking questions, the film slowly expires into a series of preconceived attitudes that ultimately have the pietyand something of the dramatic impactof a public-service clean-air commercial. Is there anyone here who'll stand up for hypocrisy? No? Then for whom is this movie intended?Given what becomes the numbing predictability of Jean Max's screenplay, Mr. Simenon obtains some decent performances, though they are all pretty much defined by how they are required to behave, not by character but by the point of the movie, which, simply put, is that anyone will compromise when his own interests are at stake.The exception to the rule in ""By the Blood of Others"" is the Mayor's daughter, a spunky, beautifully tanned young woman played by Mariangela Melatolong before she met Lina Wertmllerwhose bravery and love are quite spectacular and not in the least convincing.The supporting cast includes Yves Beneyton as the mental patient, a young man who looks as if he could be still another son of John Carradine; Bernard Blier as the Mayor; Charles Vanel as the old priest who drinks to forget how terrible his flock is, and Claude Pieplu as the despicably vain prefect. Miss Demongeot's role as the hooker who is brought to the scene is not especially surprising, but it is lively, and when she is removed from the scene the movie goes extremely glum.",1977-09-15T05:00:00+0000

One has to wonder: Maybe I never got over leaving the pressurecooker of school; maybe I miss the mark of excellence impressed by the grades that Mr. Turow feels so ambivalent about; maybe I secretly wish I had studied the law. Or, more plausibly, maybe it's that Mr. Turow, having been a published shortstory writer and a Fellow and Lecturer in creative writing at Stanford before he undertook his detour into the law, can be seen as a sort of hem to writers, especially those who have ever quailed before the exquisite ambiguities of the law, not to mention its cumbersome language.

But only yesterday did it have its commercial premiere at the Renoir Cinema, where it is that theater's evening program. Though it's 22 years late in arriving, ""The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz"" is the only new movie in town about which I can say that it mustn't be missed.Buuel made some-not-so-good films after ""Archibaldo"" and before the classic ""Viridiana"" (1961), but ""Archibaldo"" is the film that really begins his extraordinarily productive late period in which he has given us such masterpieces as ""Tristana"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie,"" with the possibility of another coming up, ""That Obscure Object of Desire,"" his newest work, which will be seen at the forthcoming New York Film Festival.One might be tempted to call ""Archibaldo vintage Buuel except that that would imply the film recalls a talent since lost, worn thin, run out. ""Archibaldo"" is Buuel in the peak form with which he has continued to dazzle us in recent years. It doesn't have the superb European actors who have given ""Tristana,"" ""Discreet Charm"" and ""Phantom of Liberty"" their box-office chic, but it has the wit, the simplicity of style, the directness and, above all, the total command that make his later films seem virtually perfect realizations of the director's particular visions.""Archibaldo,"" written by Buuel and Eduardo Ugarte Pages, is the breezy, irreverent tale of a would-be arch-fiend, Archibaldo de la Cruz, well-born, rich, handsome, sensitive, who is just the tiniest bit hung up as the result of a childhood trauma.When he was 5 and the impossibly spoiled only child of wealthy bourgeois parents, he was caught one day by his governess as he was dressed in his mother's corsets. The governess scolds him, mildly, but Archibaldo is not the sort of child to take correction lightly. A few minutes later, using a music box he's been told has magical powers, he wishes the governess dead. No sooner wished than accomplished. The young woman is immediately killed by a stray bullet from a revolution raging outside.The sight of the boring, but very pretty, governess lying dead on the carpet, her skirts in a tangle around her upper thighs, makes a lasting impression on the boy, who thereafter goes through life confusing love, death and sexuality. Through a series of outrageous coincidences, the objects of Archibaldo's sexual desires and sadistic impulses are dispatched by circumstances over which he has no control but for which he feels increasingly guilty.As played by Ernesto Alonso, an actor who has the charm and the wit that Fernando Rey has displayed in similar roles in more recent Buuel films, Archibaldo is a very polite, considerate and wise nut, aware of almost everything except that he is the inevitable (in Buuel's view) product of religious and sexual repression.Archibaldo is innocent of the crimes he tries to confess to the chief of police but though this film is high comedy, his innocence is not much different from that of the delinquents of Buuel's ""Los Olvidados""the slum kids who commit unspeakable atrocities but feel no guilt whatsoever. Archibaldo and the slum children inhabit very different kinds of films though the social orders are equally bankrupt in both.In ""Archibaldo,"" Buuel's mood is light-hearted, benign and extremely funny. Archibaldo's salvation eventually is brought about by an act that might be described as a surrogate murder of the beautiful young woman he loves, and whose waxen effigy he happily burns up in his pottery oven.Miroslava Stern, who was billed simply as Miroslava in American films (""The Brave Bulls""), is cool and self-possessed as the beautiful model and tour-guide who finally is responsible for bringing Archibaldo out of his fantasy world. Unbilled is the excellent child actor who plays the young Archibaldo. Eva Calvo is the brat's mother, the sort of woman who, when she's told she can't go to the theater because of the revolution, stamps her pretty little foot and whines, ""It would have to be today.""",1977-09-16T05:00:00+0000

First, it was the acceptance of tanning gels as a way of frankly looking good. Then came the great hair explosion, with its attendant sprays, blow dryers and the need for regular styling. Now, men are starting to accept what women have recognized for years. That moisturizers and skin care products are important for a healthy skin not just a good looking one. Michael Gibbons, vice president and general manager of Aramis Inc., a division of Estee Lauder, knows that men are buying moisturizers. In March we introduced a Moisture Care System for men in department stores, he says. Less than four weeks later those stores were sold out.

us,'Joy Reign' Makes History Live,"""Let Joy Reign Supreme"" ""(Que La Fte Commence""), the second film by Bertrand Tavernier, the young French critic and film scholar who turned director with the excellent ""The Clockmaker,"" reminds us of the special pleasures of what Hollywood used to call the ""historical picture,"" when the historical picture was done well and wasn't just a lot of waxy-looking actors walking around in oddly cut trousers or writing with feathers instead of pens.The title is purposely ironic. ""Let Joy Reign Supreme"" is a witty provocative, visually dazzling re-creation of French political and social life during the crucial last years of Philippe d'Orlans, regent for the young Louis XV, who was 5 years old at the death of his great-grandfather, Louis XIV.When the old Sun King died in 1715, France had been at the peak of its power and glory. Before the end of the century, though, it would be swept by the greatest, bloodiest revolution the world had yet seen. It is the idea of Mr. Tavernier and Jean Aurenche, the veteran French filmwriter who collaborated with the director on the screenplay, that some of the factors that made the revolution inevitable were more or less locked into place by events that took place during Philippe's regency.For the benefit of those of us who may not be quite as up on French history as they are, the writers have provided us with a brief introduction that sets the scene and the time (1720-23) for the film that follows. Some references in the movie remain obscure, but mostly it is a tumultuously vivid evocation of people, place and period, with particular emphasis on three men.The first is Philippe, the regent, superbly played by Philippe Noiret, an intelligent, civilized, sophisticated man who says, when he remembers that his daughter is an abbess, ""I don't get along with my son-in-law."" Philippe is not an unenlightened ruler but he is limited by his fondness for epic debauchery and by his noble birth. He really cannot think of the lower orders except as abstract beings.The second is Philippe's principal foreign minster, the Abb Dubois, a cynical, ambitious, sardonic man, the son of a peasant, a churchman who has absolutely no knack for saying Mass and who schemes to be made an archbishop because the power of archbishops comes from God and need not depend on the passing fancies of any temporal rulers. It's a marvelous role that Jean Rochefort plays with great style, especially in the Abb's scenes with Philippe, the lifetime friend he faithfully attends but who can say, when the chips are down, ""I hope you die a painful death.""The third key figure is a Breton nationalist, the short-tempered, rugged but doomed-to-fail Marquis de Pontcallec (Jean Pierre Marielle), who has grand dreams of seceding from France to establish the Republic of Brittany. Pontcallec writes insulting letters to Philippe, negotiates for aid from the Spanish King but, when the time for rebellion arrives, find himself alone on the field.""Que La Fte Commence"" (""Let the Party Begin""), the film's original French title, could be the cry that begins one of Philippe's exhausting, all-night orgies, as well as one that heralds the beginning of the end of the French monarchy.As much as he delights in the interplay of power and personalities, Mr. Tavernier delights in re-creating the look and sound (soundtrack music is by Philippe himself) of the period. ""Let Joy Reign Supreme"" is one of the handsomest, most densely detailed color films I've seen since ""Barry Lyndon.""The movie, which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is so rich in referencesto everything from the boom in New World real estate and reforms in French banking procedures to the toilet habits of the aristocracythat it might send you to the library for more information. The panorama that Mr. Tavernier sets before us is alive. It's also seen through the bifocal lens of a moviemaker who, though fascinated by the closeup incident, never loses the long view. A fine film.",1977-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The only good news lies in what the bill does not include. Organized labor wanted, but failed to get, a formula linking the minimum to an index of manufacturing wages; it would have automatically raised the minimum wage in the future without additional Congressional action. The House also rejected an attempt to exempt teenagers from the increase; this would have meant more work for youngsters but less for older breadwinners.

Altman's has just opened what it calls a trend shop that is filled with home accessories in the Art Deco style, from tumblers frosted with a single opulent flower to a photosilkscreened gardenia print covering throw pillows and a huge pouf. Many of the items, in glass, ceramics, metal and fabric, come from Milan and Paris. Some, like the few pieces of furniture, are domestic, and even Japan makes a contribution with roundcornered, rectilinear dinnerware. Not only motif and line, but color gives these things the spiritif not the letterof Art Deco. Colors in the shop are cool, clear grays, buff and all the variations of pink, from salmon through apricot to peach and up again through rose. Prices are from $3 for placemats to $550 for then pouf; most, however, are in the $25 to $35 price range. The shop is on Altman's fifth floor.",1977-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Varda's 'One Sings',"THE 15TH NEW YORK Film Festival gets very fashionably under way tonight at Avery Fisher Hall with a woman's picturea movie by, for and about women. These are women who haven't exactly done away with men but they have successfully established an emotional strength thatunintentionally, I thinkmakes the men around them look superfluous for everything except for the reproduction of the species and singing in the kind of harmony that requires a soprano, an alto, a tenor and a bass.The film is ""One Sings, the Other Doesn't,"" written and directed by Agns Varda, who, over the years, has made so many interesting, original, surprising films (""Le Bonheur,"" ""Lion's Love,"" ""Daguerreotypes,"" among others) that critics no longer feel compelled to make a big sexist deal out of the presence of a woman in a field dominated by men.In a peculiar way, now, ""One Sings, the Other Doesn't"" wipes all that away. It's as if Miss Varda had become fed up with the old integration bit and had switched to a new separate-but-equal line and, instead of demonstrating a woman's right to be taken seriously as a film artist or even as a person, had begun her own propaganda campaign.""One Sings, the Other Doesn't"" has some good sequences in it, is beautifully acted by two actresses who are new to me, is handsomely composed but, at key moments, it's as phonyas relentlessly schematic and upbeatas Soviet neo-realist art. It's of less interest as a movie than as a statement of position.The film, which opens its commercial engagement tomorrow at the Plaza Theater, is about two women and their friendship over approximately 15 years when each in her own fashion achieves some kind of liberation from the chains that bind one exclusively to kitchen, kids and kaffeeklatsch.Suzanne (Thres Liotard), the more conventional of the two, and also the more interesting, is a pretty brunette who lives with an unsuccessful photographer named Jerme (Robert Dadis) who gives her babies and love, but whose wife refuses to divorce him. Jerome appreciates women but he cannot cope. His studio is filled with pictures of women of all ages, shapes and dispositions. ""I'm after women in their naked truth,"" he says at one point, but though he loves and admires them, he's incapable of doing much more than making them pregnant. Jerme commits suicide.Pauline (Valrie Mairesse), nicknamed Apple, several years younger than Suzanne, sees Suzanne's impossible position and resolves not to be similarly caught. She becomes a successful street-singer and women's rights worker and suddenly, to her surprise, falls in love with a young Iranian student. Darius (Ali Raffi), her lover, appears to share her ""radical"" views, that is, until they go home to Iran where he's as much of a chauvinist as the next fellow.Suzanne, abandoned by Jerome through his suicide, takes her children to the farm of her disapproving parents in the south of France. During the day she tends the stock. At night she teaches herself to type and, in the kind of transition that is typical of this film, she suddenly becomes a successful family-planning counselor whose own children are models of adjustment.Pauline/Apple, who has given up her singing career to follow her husband home to the picture-postcard scenery of Iran, has a child and feels she must get on with her own life. She and Darius reach an agreement: he can keep the first baby if he makes her pregnant again so that she can have one of her own, which is how they work out their problems.Throughout all these adventures, Suzanne and Apple keep up a correspondence whose principal theme is how each misses the other, feels a deep womanly kinship to the other, and longs for a reunion so that they can talk about women and women's problems.Somehow, I never particularly believe in this friendship, nor do I believe in the sunny resolution to the various problems.It all has the air of whistling in the dark, or maybe of positive thinking. When Apple and her all-woman combo sing in public squares, the repeated refrain is ""I'm a womanI'm me!"" The self-absorption is intense. It's also abstract. If we were more aware of the toll taken of the two women in their struggles, the film would carry more emotional impact. As it is, it has a sort of high-toned perfunctoriness to it.The two leading actresses are appealing in ways the material is not, and Miss Varda obtains some attractive performances from the children in her cast.I admit that my tepid reaction to ""One Sings, the Other Doesn't"" is biased. I'm no more or less interested in ""women's"" pictures than in ""men's"" pictures. I am interested in good movies, which transcend sex.",1977-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Two Documentaries Depict Erosion of Ideals by Time,"History recollected by the people who made it and the inevitable erosion of ideals by time are the themes shared by a pair of American documentaries, ""Men of Bronze"" and Children of Labor,"" which will be shown at the 15th New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 6 and Monday at 9:30 P.M.Of the two, ""Men of Bronze,"" which is about the exploits of the largely black 369th U.S. Infantry Regiment in World War I, is the most moving and finished, if only because the film makers have somehow scaled their subject to the dimensions of film. ""Children of Labor"" examines the social and political history of Finnish immigrants to this country beginning at the turn-of-the-century, with emphasis on the radical Finnish-American tradition. The film is effective as far as it goes but the subject appears to be too big and complex to fit neatly into a 53-minute movie.William Miles, who directed ""Men of Bronze,"" and Paul Killiam who produced the film with Mr. Miles, have constructed their film out of old newsreel footage and stills and, most importantly, from interviews with three excellent subjects.The first is the patrician Hamilton Fish Sr., who was a captain with the 369th and who seems to represent the best of an American aristocratic tradition long gone. Another is Melville T. Miller, is still wonderfully garrulous, witty Brooklyn man who enlisted in the 369th when it was still a part of the New York National Guardit didn't receive its Federal designation until it was attached to the French Army in 1918.Mr. Miller, now in his mid-seventies, appears to remember everything clearly but with the particular detachment of time that can make even the most hair-raising memories funny.The most interesting interview, even though he says less than the other two, is the comparatively taciturn Frederick H. Williams, a grizzled old black man whose memories are not entirely sweet, and whose silences and pauses suggest that, in his case, time may not have healed all wounds.""Men of Bronze"" is a fine tribute to the history of the 369th, whose spectacular battle records proved that black soldiers were fit for considerably more than stevedore duty. This is a lesson that apparently wasn't even understood by World War Two, when the United States Navy would pressure black enlistees to take mess dutythough, of course, there was no doubt in anyone's mind by the time Vietnam came along.""Children of Labor"" is no less sincere but the subject is too vast to be covered by a short film except in a sort of textbook style that touches names, dates and places so rapidly that at the end you suspect you might be subjected to a spot quiz.",1977-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,A French Silent of 1913 Holds Up,"""L'Enfant de Paris"" is an exceptionally well-photographed 1913 silent film that has been included in the New York Film Festival partly because it was a personal favorite of the late Henri Langlois, founder of the Cinemathque Francaise. Directed by Leonce Perret, who made or appeared in an estimated 600 films (21 of them in America) before he died in 1935, the movie tells the story of an almost inhumanly sweet little girl who is kidnapped by scoundrels.The story is unexceptional, and so is Perret's general approach. But his technical sophistication is quite impressive, particularly during a long sequence in which the kidnapper has the good taste to cart his captive off to Nice. ""L'Enfant de Paris"" is well worth seeing on the strength of its location footage alone.As the film begins, the little girl is rich and happy, safe in the bosom of her loving family. Half an hour later her father, a soldier, has disappeared in battle, and her mother has died of grief. The sweet little girl is sent to an orphanage???, where the other girls laugh at her and the teachers take her favorite doll away.When she escapes from the orphanage and faints as a result of her exertions, a crook comes along to steal her gold locket, which of course contains pictures of her poor, lost parents. As an afterthought, he steals her???, too.The little girl, who is carried through the film like a human suitcase, winds up in the predictable den of iniquity, living with a drunken shoemaker and his hunchbacked assistant. The assistant falls in love with the little girl, rather unwholesomely, and eventually returns her to her father, who is, of course, not dead after all. In movies as treacly as this one, fathers who disappear in battle seldom are.The little girl, Suzanne LeBret, has a strangely middle-aged face and an acting range that allows for little more than her extending her arms joyfully or staring tragically at the floor. The crook, played by Louis Leubas, is more interesting, because he oozes crookedness from every pore, as do his very amusing henchmen. ""L'Enfant de Paris"" has no dialogue subtitles, only a few printed telegrams and newspaper articles, and would seemingly lend itself to overacting of the most painful kind. Fortunately, many of the performances are as unexpectedly forth???-right as the stunning pre-World War I landscapes.",1977-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Femmes Fatales' Opens:Movie Falters After Getting Off to Fairly Good Start,"For a while, ""Femmes Fatales,"" the French film that opened yesterday at the Columbia II and Quad 3 theaters, gives indication of accomplishing the considerable feat of being a successful comedy about misogyny.But about halfway along it stops deriving its strength from the portrayals of Jean-Pierre Marielle as a jaded gynecologist and Jean Rochefort as an irrisistible pimp who is his companion in flight from women. Instead, it shifts abruptly in mood and focus from their new lives in a tiny village where they loaf, cook, eat, drink, befriend the local clergy and counsel a young boy against the consequences of sex.In a jarring transition from reality into fantasy, ""Femmes Fatales"" transforms its two principals into leaders of a horde of like-minded refugees. Pursued by a uniformed army of lubricious women, the pair are taken prisoner and turned into scientifically monitored studs before they are turned outbroken, terrified and prematurely agedto a bleak life-on-the-run that brings them to an ironic and unexpected final destination.The effect of the transition is very much as though Bertrand Blier, who also directed ""Going Places,"" had lost his footing on the most slippery high wire he could find. Certainly these are not the times when the making of a movie that makes women and their sexuality the objects of scorn and revulsion can be deemed anything less than an exercise in risk and an invitation to condign condemnation.But thanks to the credibility of Mr. Marielle as the gynecologist, Paul, and to Mr. Rochefort as the pimp, Albert, director Blier manages to teeter about halfway toward success on his own terms before turning cosmic and plunging into artistic failure.""Femmes Fatales,"" sexually graphic, foul-mouthed, intermittently funny, initially deft and ultimately clumsy, is neither witty enough nor strong enough to override the current of social history. Narrow and likely to offend many, it stands like a bigot at a conference on brotherhood, capable of generating laughter, yes, but chiefly remarkable for insensitivity to time and place.",1977-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Brazilian Story of a Saint Puzzles,"""Tent of Miracles"" is to be commended on a couple of scores: It condemns racism and it was made in Brazil; a country whose films don't receive much representation in this country. It's also the story of a very saintly man; and certainly such stories are rare these days. That said, ""Tent of Miracles"" is also too messy and jumbled to have many other selling points.The subject of the film is Pedro Archanjo, a black Bahian sociologist who is also supposed to have been a brilliant philosopher, his principal theory being that miscegenation is necessary and healthy for Brazilian society. Unfortunately, his story is told and discussed by a bunch of hip young film makers, supposedly at work on a biographical movie, who aren't properly equipped to explain his genius. Their story, which takes up almost as much time as the movie-within-a-movie about Archanjo, is uninteresting and at times almost unintelligible.Archanjo turns out to have been a man who enthusiastically practiced what he preached. In the film's best sequences, he appears as a young man, involved with women of all shades and persuasions and merrily outraging the supposedly white upper classes. One of Archanjo's theories is that everyone in Bahia is of mixed blood anyway, and one of his supposedly most daring acts is to publish a booklet naming black ancestors of all the fanciest white families.Nelson Pereira dos Santos is a well-established Brazilian director, but the film is surprisingly clumsy, almost amateurish at times: for instance, it is at first difficult to tell whether the footage of Archanjo's story is meant to be a series of flashbacks or excerpts from the film being made. A white American scientist, who yells things such as ""May I have my money?"" at the top of his lungs, is supposed to be a Nobel Laureate but looks more like a freshman quarterback. Sonia Dias is a great beauty, but her ubiquitousness in the film goes entirely unexplained.",1977-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Miss Loren and Mastroianni Light Screen as a Team in 'Special Day',"Antonietta and Gabriele make an extremely unlikely couple. She's an overworked, barely literate housewife, the mother of six, a woman with a drawn face and the haggard expression of someone who's long since given up on what she looks like, but she accepts her lot, which includes a talking mynah bird that can't even get her name right. She is, however, an enthusiastic supporter of Mussolini, who is, for Antonietta, both a savior and a sex symbol. She keeps a scrapbook on his life.Gabriele is a fastidious bachelor, intelligent, sensitive and sardonic, and he's at the end of his rope. He's been cashiered from his job as an announcer on the government-sponsored radio station because he's suspected of being degenerate, that is, homosexual, which he is. In Italy in 1938, homosexuals were rounded up and packed off to Sardinia, where they couldn't contaminate the Fascist culture.In Ettore Scola's funny, humane ""A Special Day""an acting tour de force for Sophia Loren and Marcello MastroianniAntonietta and Gabriele are never really a couple, but their brief encounter lights up the screen with the kind of radiance you get only from great movie actors who also are great stars.""A Special Day,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, takes place on the day of Hitler's 1938 state visit to Rome, where he was given a gigantic, hysterically enthusiastic reception by Mussolini, the King, the diplomatic corps, leading Italian industrialists (whose names are still familiar) and 90 percent of the city's population and a military parade that lasted almost as long as Mussolini's campaign in Ethiopia.After packing off her six children and her husband (all properly uniformed) to attend the rally, Antonietta sets about to clean up the debris within the cramped apartment when Rosamunda, the mynah bird, escapes and flies to the other side of the courtyard of the now-empty apartment block. This is the device that brings Antonietta and Gabriele together for almost two hours of comic and touching confidences, arguments and self-searching that lead, eventually, to a love scene that is simultaneously ecstatic and forlorn. It's something, I suspect, that only Miss Loren and Mr. Mastroianni could bring off so triumphantly.""A Very Special Day"" is pure theatrical contrivance, and this is part of the pleasure as we watch two extraordinary performers test themselves, take risks, find unexpected pockets of humor and pathos in characters that one doesn't easily associate with the public personality.Miss Loren is magnificent in the best role she's had since ""Two Women,"" for which she won an Academy Award. Of the two stars, she has a slightly easier time of it in that in the film's earlier scenes the character is presented to us in context, within the bosom of her uproarious family and in relation to her self-important, macho, peanut-brained husband, played by John Vernon.Mr. Mastroianni has a somewhat more difficult time of it if only because we seem him isolated from any social-psychological landscape that might define the man he is. We have to take him at his word, but because we bring to any Mastroianni performance the memories of so many earlier ones, it's initially difficult to accept Gabriele as the distraught, suicidal homosexual he is supposed to be.Once the two characters have been brought together, though, and the revelations revealed, the movie takes off in the sort of breathtaking display of teamwork I associate with Hepburn and Tracy, Lunt and Fontanne and, of course, Loren and Mastroianni in ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" and ""Marriage, Italian-Style.""They don't do it all by themselves. Mr. Scola, who was responsible for ""We All Loved Each Other So Much"" earlier this year, has provided them with good, sometimes quite extravagant material to work with. The screenplay, which he wrote with Ruggero Maccari and, say the credits, ""in collaboration with Maurizio Costanzo,"" is full of wit and feeling even when we're aware of facile ironies.But for all the facility, which certainly isn't bad in itself, ""A Special Day"" has a solid foundation in honesty. This is no middle-aged ""Tea and Sympathy."" The encounter doesn't turn Gabriele into a straight or Antonietta into an anti-Fascist bomb-thrower. It enriches their lives, which, on a somewhat smaller scale, is what this film does.",1977-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Kane), Hernando Cortez, Juliet, Adam, Jesus Christ and a team of football players cavorting under one roof to the music of Anton Dvorak, Edvard Grieg, Antonio Vivaldi, Richard Wagner and Giaccomo Puccini, among others.And perhaps that's reason enough to run off to the 15th New York Film Festival tonight at 6:15 P.M. or next Sunday at 3 P.M. to see the Mexican movie ""Pafnucio Santo,"" which may be the most eclectic extravaganza to play Lincoln Center since ""The Night of the Scarecrow"" by the Brazilian director Srgio Ricardo made the festival lineup in 1974.But audiences in search of films of less reach and greater grasp are best advised that ""Pafnucio Santo"" iswhile admirable in some respectschiefly a curiosity.The work of Rafael Corkidi, perhaps best known as the cameraman on the Alejandro Godorowsky films ""El Topo"" and ""Holy Mountain,"" this movie mixes religion, politics, Mexican history and opera.At its simplest, it deals with the search for a woman to bear a new Messiah, undertaken by a small, football-helmeted boy, Pafnucio, at the behest of a sinister-looking, black-caped heavenly emissary who has borne witnesswe seeto the flight from Paradise, cross burnings by the Ku Klux Klan, the march of Jewish children into Nazi death camps and the crucifixion of Jesus.The search undertaken by Pafnucio carries him back and forth in Mexican history from Cortez to modern revolutionaries, with Patricia Hearst thrown in as Patricia Kane, obviously a descendant of the cinema Citizen of the same name. Everybody sings, and in the case of classic compositions, the original lyrics are retained, although the subtitles on the screen have the characters saying such things as ""Don't you see the Empire is crumbling?"" or ""Your God killed our godsour temples, our art all lie in ruins.""""Pafnucio Santo"" is at its best visually. Mr. Corkidi has a keen eye for the visually striking: figures set against desolate landscapes, football players in full uniform drilling in the ruins of a cathedral, banner-waving peasant armies. But his ambitious movie is a bit like a homemade backyard shrine, admirable for what it says about the builder's capacity for compassion, regrettable in its confusion of prettiness for high art.",1977-09-27T05:00:00+0000

The truck, seen intermittently, rolls inexorably along highways and byways. There is no other action.The script is about a woman possessed of ""the noblesse of banality,"" to use Miss Duras's phrase. The woman is given a lift by a young truck driver. ""He's exercising his profession,"" Miss Duras explains, ""and she, she's tranported by him.""In the truck, as the script has it, the woman sings and talks a great deal. Mr. Depardieu's character asks her. ""But what are you talking about?"" ""She says, 'I'm talking,'"" is Miss Duras's reply.""The Truck"" is full of exasperatingly banal interchanges, which are in no way improved or illuminated by Miss Duras's admission of her character's banality. It is also rather coyly self-pitying, because Miss Duras and her character seem to overlap, and the character is at times made to seem pathetic.But the scenes of the truck take on an eerie grandeur after a while, and Miss Duras's disdain for her audience's expectations becomes perversely transfixing. It's a pity that her script is not as stern and unrelenting as the film's visual style.On the same bill, and on quite a different note, is ""Grandpa,"" a 29-minute short by Stephen Forman and Paul Desaulniers, an affectionate and admiring portrait of Mr. Forman's feisty grandfather. The talkative grandfather says more in this film's first five minutes than Mr. Depardieu says during the entirety of ""The Truck.""",1977-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Without seeming to try, without straining, the movie is less a story of prison life than it is the story of a segment of modern American urban society that's on the bottom but refuses to recognize the fact, if only because there are shadowy figures even further down the scale of values.The film will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 9:30 and repeated there tomorrow evening at 6:15. It will begin its regular commercial engagements Friday at the Sutton and Paramount Theaters.""Short Eyes"" has had a long and fascinating history, having begun life as a workshop production staged by Marvin Felix Camillo and the Family, the resident company at the Theater of Riverside Church, where Mr. Piero was a playwright in residence. It was subsequently picked up by Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, and presented at the Anspacher/Public Theater, from which it was moved to the Vivian Beaumont Theater in May 1974. Along the way it won two Obies and the New York Drama Critics' Award as the best play of 1973-74.Its theatrical origins are quite apparent in this furious but controlled screen version directed by Robert M. Young, who made a number of award-winning television documentaries in the 60's. He also collaborated, with Michael Roemer, on the fine feature film, ""Nothing but a Man,"" shown at the Film Festival in 1964.In this case, though, the theatrical origins contribute to the claustrophobic atmosphere that is essential to the point of ""Short Eyes,"" which is about a kind of overcrowding that is the physical equivalent to emotional desperation. There's no way out. As lines of dialogue overlap in that supercharged way of a theatrical production, so do Mr. Piero's characters fight for space in the single cellblock where all the action takes place.The blacks have staked out one section, the Puerto Ricans another and the white minority still another. The one person who has no territory is the new man, a nice-looking, mild-mannered, WASPy fellow named Clark Davis (Bruce Davison), who, once the word gets out that he is a ""short-eyes""prison jargon for child molesteris subjected to the systematized torture that gives shape to the story.Although there are only four members of the stage production in the film, the acting has the balance and the ferocity to be found in a group of actors who have been playing withand againstone another for years. This is ensemble playing of the first rank.Among those you'll remember are Jose Perez as the father-confessor figure among Puerto Rican prisoners, a man who tries unsuccessfuly to maintain some order in the ranks; Don Blakely as an angry black nationalist who, when the chips are down, is unable to commit a race murder; Shawn Elliott as a Puerto Rican prisoner whose viciousness has both grace and charm to it; Tito Goya as the ""kid"" who is the object of apparently unwanted attentions, and Joseph Carberry as the leader of the white prisoners, who initially befriends ""Short Eyes"" and then becomes his most relentless judge.Curtis Mayfield, the singer and composer, makes a brief, very effective appearance as an older prisoner who wears ""granny"" glasses and believes there should be some decency even among people fighting to hang on to the bottom rung of the ladder. If Mr. Davison stands outwhich he doesit's not only because of his position within the film as the victim of the victims, but also because he gives a performance so intimate it's almost painful to watch.There is something of this quality about the entire film. ""Short Eyes"" is cough and depressing but it's also remarkably effective film making, which relieves the gloom at bit.",1977-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Bresson Takes Stock,"""THE DEVIL PROBABLY"" (""La Diable Probablement"") is the 12th feature film by Robert Bresson, the rigorously original French film maker who was 70 years old last Sunday. This fact should be mentioned immediately because this latest Bresson is very much the work of a man taking stock, which is not to say that it's by any means sentimental or gently autumnal.Time hasn't softened the Bresson esthetic. The world he perceives still looks unlike that of any other director. Objects, people, placeseverything is seen with a clarity so fine that his images achieve something beyond realism, as if clarity so intense could distort truth, at least as we have come to accept it.The film will be shown at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 9:30 and tomorrow evening at 6:15.""The Devil Probably"" has the air of something out of the 1960's in that it recalls a time when dropping out was so fashionable it was virtually epidemic among the young of the bourgeoisie. But Bresson is not a film maker of fashion. Fashions rise and fall around him like tides around a continent.This film, Bresson's first to be based entirely on his own screenplay, is about a young man who, realizing that he cannot support the world as he finds it, nor hope to change it through revolution or religion, nor even to adapt to it through psychoanalysis, chooses the way of the ultimate dropoutsuicide. In telling you this, I'm not giving away a plot point because Bresson, as is his custom, refuses to allow us to watch his movies in anticipation of what's going to happen next.He reports this suicide in newspaper headlines in the opening sequence, then proceeds backwards from there as he coolly presents us with the picture of an age that, like his hero, Charles (Antoine Monnier), whose androgynous beauty is a directorial position, is systematically destroying itself, though in preposterous arrogance and innocence. Charles's choice is an intellectual statement.So, too, are all Bresson films, which may explain why they are so difficult on a first viewing and become, with repeated showings, increasingly rich and rewarding. One of the difficulties, as others have noted, is that Bresson films simply do not operate on the same senses that most other films do. There's no easy identification through primary emotions. His actors don't act. They exist to be moved around and so lighted and photographed to fit the director's line, which is simultaneously instinctive and stern, like a poet's.Two recent Bresson films that have given me more and more pleasure over the years are ""Lancelot of the Lake"" (1974) and ""La Femme Douce"" (1969), both of which I found almost impossible when I first saw them. I didn't find ""The Devil Probably"" at all impossible, which makes me wonder whether I'm tuning into Bresson or if ""The Devil Probably"" doesn't really measure up.The new film looks and sounds like a Bresson work, but it's not especially difficult. Furthermore, though no one comes close to smiling within the film, there are times when it's almost funny. At one point Charles and a friend, riding on a bus, argue about the responsibility for the world's dreadful state, involving suddenly the other passengers and finally the bus driver who, when he turns around to speak, rams into something. Only Bresson would have the nerve to keep his camera on the feet of the passengers instead of showing us what then happens in the street.The pollution of the contemporary worldintellectual as well as physicalis the apparent subject of the film but a contemplation of idealized beauty is the method, which is why the looks of the actors are so important. It's no accident that the actor who plays Charles looks startlingly like Tina Irissari, the girl Charles sometimes lives with, or that they both look like Dominique Sanda, who had never acted before she made ""La Femme Douce.""No other director I can think of has come as close as Bresson to molding his players into what are, in effect, variations on a continuing personality, much the way a painter might.What sets apart ""The Devil Probably,"" though, are social concerns that are sometimes expressed with irony and wit. ""Isn't there a limit to doing nothing?"" asks Charles's friend Michel. ""Yes,"" says Charles, ""but after that there's extraordinary pleasure.""When Charles and his friends go on a picnic, ordinarily blas Parisians exclaim when they see an old man catch what one of them describes with wonder as ""a live fish!"" In the world that Bresson shows us in ""The Devil Probably,"" the catching of a live fish has become not only very rare, but also a crime.",1977-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Good Buddies,"MOST OF THE PRINCIPALS in Jonathan Demme's ""Handle With Care"" have citizens' band radios, and these people careen into one another's lives just as easily as they interrupt one another's broadcasts. The visual editing of the film is very much like its sound editing, so scenes become short and fragmented, like loosely overheard snatches of conversation. The radio conceit also provides the film with a unifying notion, because each character has a real name and a C.B. ""handle,"" with separate identities for each. One of the characters even spells this out, though the point is hard to miss: ""Everybody in this town is somebody they're not supposed to be.""""Handle With Care,"" which was originally released in other cities under the title ""Citizen's Band,"" is so clever that its seams show. Mr. Demme's tidiest parallels and most purposeful compositions are such attention-getters that the film has a hard time turning serious for its finale, in which characters who couldn't communicate directly come to understand one another at long last.The film will be shown tonight at 9:30 in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center as part of the New York Film Festival and again tomorrow at 3 P.M.Even though the film's energy and its intelligence are at war with each other all the way through, their incompatibility is eminently engrossing. The structure is thoughtful, and some of the imagery is so calculated it seems chilly; on the other hand, the film's surface is flippant and funny, full of talented performers in whimsical, open-ended roles. It's easy to see why ""Handle With Care"" was too scrambled to succeed during its first go-round. It's even easier to see that the film deserves a second chance.The characters include a bigamous trucker (Charles Napier) and his two wives (Marcia Rodd and Ann Wedgworth), who first meet on a bus in one of the funniest sequences here; after comparing family photos and then weeping their eyes out, the wives begin to wonder if they aren't related. Another triangle includes two competitive brothers (Paul Le Mat and Bruce McGill) and their mutual sweetheart (Candy Clark), who is fored, by an otherwise-graceful screenplay, to tell one of them ""I'm a woman, not a trophy.""There is also a squealy, roly-poly hooker who operates out of a mobile home, and who laments ""Now with that gol-darned 55-mile limit, nobody's got time for nothin.'"" There is the brothers' drunken old dad, who is forever threatening to eat the family dog. And there are a wide variety of crackpots on the airwaves, who become Mr. Le Mat's prey after he decides to do his civic duty by eliminating all improperly used C.B.'s with a baseball bat.The plot may operate on the premise that wackiness is its own reward, but Mr. Demme's direction is decidedly, almost jarringly, on the serious side.

You might think that the next morning the fellow, using some discretion, would ask the young woman how she's feeling, or maybe whether or not she's been in chemotherapy or if she's recently come into contact with a lead-based paint. Is her ceiling flaking?Not Bobby Deerfield, the title character in this big, expensive, ultimately ridiculous movie that appears to have been constructed to be a ""Love Story"" on wheels.""Bobby Deerfield"" may turn out to be the year's most cynical movie made by people who know better, including Sydney Pollack, the director, and Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay. It stars Al Pacino as a self-centered, remarkably uninteresting (and uninterested) international race-car driver and Marthe Keller as his doomed, soon-to-be-bald beloved, a girl whose manic behavior is supposed to indicate a love of life but suggests rather more strongly that she's in desperate need of a Valium.The film, which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Coronet Theaters, starts with a good deal of promise, that is, with a mystery: In a race in France one of Bobby's colleagues is killed when his car, a duplicate of the one Bobby is driving, cracks up for no apparent reason. Bobby, a boy from Newark who's hit the big time (French mistress, apartment in Paris, product-endorsements), sets out to find out what's wrong with the car. His hunt takes him to a fancy Swiss clinic where he interviews a man who has survived the crash. He also, unfortunately, meets Miss Keller, also a patient and someone clearly to be avoided even if you don't mind loose hair.The would-be tragedy of their love story, which is supposed to resurrect Bobby's humanity, is neutralized by just about everything the film's makers think they have going for them, incluing the scenery (the Swiss Alps, Bellagio, Florence, Paris) to which the lovers gravitate as if they were travel agents. It's so relentlessly picturesque you may come out of the theater and walk directly to 42d Street to become reoriented.There's also something off-putting about the lovers Mr. Pacino and Miss Keller play, sometimes coyly and sometimes with such intensity you can't believe they're in a movie of such essential fatuousness. They rattle around the script, saying its lines as if they were touching bases, but they succeed in creating not a single moment of genuine pathos.It says something about the sort of film ""Bobby Deerfield"" is that the audience is inclined to applaud at the sight of hot-air balloons. It also says something about me, I suppose, that this is the first film about automobile racing I've ever seen when I wished the movie would get back to the track. I'd put up with just about anything to avoid watching Mr. Pacino doing an imitation of Mae West and hearing Miss Keller, who is supposed to be Italian describe things as ""bowing"" when she means boring and blab on endlessly about death.""Bobby Deerfield,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some vulgar language and partial nudity that will be seen by those members of the audience who are not taking a snooze.",1977-09-30T05:00:00+0000
