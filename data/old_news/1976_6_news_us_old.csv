Claude wants to kill Isabelle, but he doesn't. Because he loves her he contents himself by knocking her around a bit and then by brooding. As he tells his best friend, as if describing an irretrievable loss, ""She was everything to me, a mother, a sister, a wife, a whore. . . .""All this happens a year before the start of Claude Berri's French comedy, ""Male of the Century,"" but it adds substantially to Claude's worries when Isabelle becomes one of three hostages taken in the course of a bank holdup. Claude worries less that she will come to some physical harm than that she will fall in love with the bank robber.""Male of the Century,"" which opened yesterday at the Juliet 2 Theater, is so humanely conceived and nicely cast that the principal target of its comedymale arrogance of an almost prehistoric orderis a lot more genial and fresh than it has any right to be.Mr. Berri himself plays Claude with an epically oatish self-assurence that is very funny. Claude is no answer to any maiden's prayer. He's suspicious, pot bellied and mean-tempered, but he somehow transmits his own grand vision of himself to others. It's typical that Claude, who runs a tiny boutique specializing in men's trousers, should describe himselfon the side of his battered delivery truckas The Pants King.Juliet Berto, looking more than ever like a young Jeanne Moreau, is equally funny as the resolutely liberated Isabelle, and Hubert Deschamps, who might remind you of a French version of Richard Haydn, has a surprising staunchness as Claude's best friend, a mild-mannered tailor with a ferocious hold on life, no matter what the disappointments.Unlike such earlier Berri comedies as ""The Two of Us"" and ""Marry Me, Marry Me,"" ""Male of the Century"" does not deal in autobiography. It's a sort of humorous ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" though it does display a strong Berri appreciation for family ties. Mr. Berri's mother plays the mother of Claude in the film in such a way that her lack of professional experience is both moving and comic, as when she visits Claude in the hospital and brings him, in her large shopping bag, one small orange and one hard-boiled egg.Mr. Berri also has a marvelous way of dealing with children, including his small son who plays that role in the film. The children remain un-self-conscious and light-hearted, and as totally self-absorbed as the character that Mr. Berri plays.""Male of the Century"" is not the greatest comedy of the year, but you probably won't see many comedies in the near future, containing a scene as firmly planted in life as the one in which Claude's two sons, eating a dinner consisting entirely of mashed potatoes, look up from their plates suddenly to recognize the television image of their mother in the bank holdup.

Like a meadow that has been turned into a parking lot, nature has been cemented over, effectively sealed off. But there are cracks, and it's these cracksterrible crevasses, reallythat are the subject of Mr. Ferreri's initially buoyant and erotic comedy that becomes, at the end, a satire of such literal brutality that most people may want to be warned. The film opened yesterday at the Fine Arts. Like ""La Grande Bouffe,"" which was about four bourgeois gentlemen who gorge themselves to death. ""The Last Woman"" is, finally, easier to talk about than to watch, especially on a full stomach. It may be the year's most ferocious satire, a film that only a very sophisticated society could support, but it's also full of brilliance, especially in the performance of Graid Depardieu, who has quite suddenly emerged as France's most talented young actor.As Grard in ""The Last Woman,"" Mr. Depardieu is the thinking man's lug. Built like a truck driver who drinks too much beer, a slob with a good deal of wit, he is a primal force too powerful to be controlled by the system of checks and balances he's been equipped with. He's not stupid. He's a bunch of outmoded attitudes that can't survive in the kind of concrete landscape that is Mr. Ferreri's comic metaphor.Grard is a factory engineer by profession and a colossally self-assured male supremacist by nature. He lives with Pierrot, his young son who doesn't yet walk, on a high floor of a spanking-new apartment house in a flat furnished with stereos, hip posters and all sorts of superfluous time-saving gadgets, including an electric carving knife.Some time before the start of the film Grard's wife has walked out on him to find her own identitywhich is all right with Grard, who doesn't mind playing mother as well as father to his son and who has no trouble finding temporary mistresses. In fact, he rather likes the temporariness of his sex partners. They don't question his ego nor invade the territory he rules as a fatheruntil the appearance of Valerie.Valerie (Ornella Muti) is ""The Last Woman,"" a voluptuous green-eyed beauty who teaches in the factory's nursery school. One night when Grard goes to pick up Pierrot, he also picks up Valerie and takes her home for what he expects will be another limited liaison. But Valerie is different. Between bouts of furious love-making she begins to settle in.In the way no other woman ever has, she also begins to invade his consciousness, which, to a Narcissus like Grard, is somehow to diminish him. When she tells him that he never succeeds in giving her an orgasm, she says it matter-of-factly, without accusation, but the effect is eventually devastating.When she tells him that Pierrot needs to be touched, cuddled and loved, he sees it as a threat to him. ""I need to be loved,"" he yells at her. Finally Valerie, sweet, beautiful, apparently passive, persuades Grard his sex is the root of his egocentricity.""You are nothing without it,"" she says, which prompts Grard to make the ultimate gesture to prove her wrong. What is Mr. Ferreri up to? Sometimes I think I know and sometimes I'm not sure I want to. Then again I suspect that he may be the most passionately wicked satirist since Jonathan Swift. His satire is an electric carving knife that cuts two ways at once. Grard is part buffoon, part tragic hero. Valerie is Eve, and the film, which begins as an uproariously erotic comedy, concludes as a spectacle so bloody it could send eroticism back to the closet forever.The film is immaculately played by Mr. Depardieu, Miss Muti, Zouzou (as Grard's first wife) and David Biffani, a little boy who apparently learned how to act even before he learned how to walk.",1976-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Jackson County Jail,' Fine Melodrama With Yvette Mimieux, on Local Screens","""If you are who you say you are,"" the small-town sheriff tells the young woman, ""you won't have any trouble."" The young woman (Yvette Mimieux) is Dinah Hunter, who has just thrown over her job with a Los Angeles advertising agency, as well as her lover of two years, and has been driving back to New York. However, all her identificationalong with her money and her carhave been stolen by a pair of pill-popping hitchhikers she picked up earlier in the day, thinking she was doing a good deed.When the hitchhikers pulled a gun on her and threw her out of the car somewhere in southern Arizona, they dropped Dinah into a nightmare land from which she probably will never emerge. ""If you are who you say you are . . .""the line becomes the theme of a fine, tough little melodrama called ""Jackson County Jail,"" which opened yesterday at the Embassy 49th Street and other theaters in New York.It isn't the film's very dismal view of Bicentennial America that gives ""Jackson County Jail"" its vigor. The film lays on the ironies and hypocrisies so heavily that it sometimes seems to be the work of especially snobbish film makers, people who think that everything between Los Angeles and New York is the boondocks.""Jackson County Jail"" is film making of relentless energy and harrowing excitement that recall the agitprop melodramas of the 30's. It's not exactly in a class with Lang's ""You Only Live Once,"" but it possesses the kind of fury that can breathe life into a melodrama even when the point of view is simple-minded.The film was directed by Michael Miller and written by Donald Stewart, neither of whom I'd heard of before. Roger Corman, sometimes known as the king of the B's, was the executive producer, and it has the drive, movement and economy of narrative that are the marks of Corman films, good and bad.""Jackson County Jail"" shows how someone as self-aware, self-assured and secure as its middle-class heroine can, literally overnight, find herself in a landscape where nothing she has ever known or believed still holds.Unable to produce identification for the sheriff, Dinah is put into the county lockup for the night. She is raped by the jailer, whom she murders in self-defense, and the next mornnng is out on the road, sharing a get-away car with a young man who is an accused murderer and admitted truck hijacker.It's preposterous, and the movie works within its own terms, though one shouldn't overanalyze it for the wrong (political) reasons.Mr. Miller and Mr. Stewart picture a land of unremitting evil and brutality where everyone is corrupt, from the wise-cracking waitress, who attempts to shortchange Dinah the first morning out, to the policeman-rapist. The only good guy is the truck hijacker who admits to thieving because he likes it and who will rationalize his life only to the extent of saying, ""The whole country is a rip-off.""The film manages to stay clear of sentimentality of the conventional sort, though when the hijacker, nicely played by Tommy Lee Jones, says with a shrug just before the final shoot-out, ""I was born dead anyway,"" it's dealing in its own sort of sentimentality.Miss Mimieux is excellent in a role that subjects her to as many bruises, humiliations and indignities as she might get in the boxing ring. All of the performances are fine and to the point. I hesitate to say too much, thus to oversell a movie that is best come upon without great expectations. I would suspect that Mr. Miller and Mr. Stewar are new film makers to watch.",1976-06-12T05:00:00+0000

I remember reading a smuggled copy some 40 years ago and wondering even then if such superhuman delights as he described in ardent detail had actually been experienced. It turns out according to Philippa Pullar's exceedingly knowledgeable biography, that Harris, a minor but fascinating figure in modern literature, dictated them in his declining years when he was impotent and in need of money and drew liberally on his imagination and abundant fantasies. The lubricity of My Life and Loves, largely fiction though it was, nonetheless gave Harris an undeserved reputation as little more than a merchant of sex. There was indeed much more to Harris than this. In London in the last 20 years of the 19th century he was an imaginative editor who helped start the career of H. G. Wells and published Bernard Shaw on music and John Addington Symonds on art and letters. He wrote some excellent short stories, including Montes the Matador, that are still worth reading.

Like others of his age and education, Mao writes reflective and epistolary verses, in a classical language and style that he confessedly hesitates to encourage among the young.

us,Answers/Questions,"A: L.B.S., Kingston, N.Y. lives on a campus that has 100yearold ginkgo trees, two female and one male. The female produces odiferous fruit in fall. He asked if there was a way to prevent fruit, and also if the fruits are edible. We have checked with several nurserymen and tree specialists and there appears to be no way of preventing the old female ginkgo trees from setting fruit. Modern nurserymen, well aware of this undesirable fruiting habit, propagate only the male trees which do not fruit. In fact, female trees are difficult to obtain now for this reason. Although the ginkgo fruits are not edible, the nuts are a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. The nuts are about the size of jelly beans, and are cooked, never eaten raw. They can be obtained canned or sold by the pound in Chinese markets. Ed.",1976-06-13T05:00:00+0000
us,ART VIEW,"About the Andr Masson retrospective that has now come to the Museum of Modern Art, it is difficultperhaps impossibleto have anything but a divided response. Mr. Masson is now 80 years old, a veteran of the Surrealist epoch in French art who, during his wartime exile in the United States in the early 1940's, also played a role in shaping the formation of the New York School. His place in the history of modern art, though by no means a major one, is thus more or less assured, yet as an artist he is a curiously elusive figure. In the past, reading about him and seeing certain pictures, one had every reason to believe in his importance, yet these pictures were never quite numerous enough, and never quite powerful or definitive enough, to confirm that importance. One had to take a great deal on faith. It required, one felt, a fullscale retrospective to settle the matterto reveal the artist who somehow remained obscured by a distinguished career.",1976-06-13T05:00:00+0000

What would have happened had he stayed?

It is amazing that in New York, in the face of such an ego, American Ballet Theater has managed to survive!

us,Film: 'Boy and His Dog':L.Q. Jones Fantasizes a Postholocaust World,"""A Boy and His Dog,"" a fantasy about the world after a future holocaust, is, more or less, a beginner's movie. It has some good ideas and some terrible ones. The good ideas are marred by awkwardness; the terrible ideas are redeemed somewhat by being, at least, unpredictable.The world has become one great mudflat, a desert roamed over by armed men, sometimes alone, sometimes in bands. They build shelters out of scrap and old tires, eat stockpiled canned food and also use it for barter, and kill weak strangers. For recreation, they go to outdoor enclosures where pornographic movies are shown on an eight-millimeter projector.All this comes under the Good Idea heading. It is a spare, miserable world L. Q. Jones, director, has set up; mean, dry and barren, where everyone wears worn and dirty clothes because there is no way to make new ones and no water to wash with. The future is poverty.Vic, a young man, well-played by Don Johnson, is the protagonist. His companion is Mr. Jones's main Terrible Idea: Blood, a talking dog. There is nothing that can be done in a movie with a dog that talks. After only a few minutes, the old adage is modified to: He doesn't do it very well, and you're not surprised that he's doing it at all.Vic meets a woman, makes love to her, and lets her entice him down into the underground society from which she has emerged. Blood advises against it, and he's right.It is a weird, rural American community, bucolic to all appearances but run as the most savage dictatorship. The dictator is Jason Robards and he's splendida kindly, folksy farmer type who gradually becomes as frightening as Heinrich Himmler.Vic runs into all kinds of trouble before the film ends. The underworld part, brilliantly grotesque as it partly is, breaks the realistic vision of the beginning. The two parts don't really work together; their contrast, and a ridiculous ending, shatter the picture. And the talking dog chews up the pieces.This is the second film directed by L. Q. Jones, better known as an actor. It is not really a success, but I hope he goes on directing.",1976-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Harry and Walter',"""HARRY and Walter Go to New York"" is a movie based on an original story and screenplay, but it's so implacably cute that you might suspect that it was based on a coloring book based on ""The Sting."" It's big and blank and so faux naif that you want to hit it over the head in the way that used to bring people to their senses in true farce, of which this is no example.The time is 1892, which you can roughly guess because the men wear bowler hats and those stiff collars that become partially detached whenever someone is harried. The story is about Harry (James Caan) and Walter (Elliott Gould), a couple of third-rate vaudevillians who become sidetracked as would-be safecrackers.It's also about Adam Worth (Michael Caine), an elegant, internationally applauded safecracker whom Harry and Walter have met during a brief stay in a Federal pen, and Lissa Chestnut (Diane Keaton), the pretty, passionately committed editor of an anarchist newspaper who decides, for reasons that are perfectly unclear, to rob the Commercial Bank and Trust Company of Lowell, Mass.There are two funny moments in the entire film: Miss Keaton's stirring declaration that ""If that bank has to be robbed, let it be robbed in the name of decency!"" and a scene in which she attempts a genteel seduction of Charles Durning, who plays the bank's president, a furiously incompetent lecher.Miss Keaton, Mr. Caine and Mr. Durning are able farceurs, which means that they lower their sights so that their entire concentration appears to be on a space of approximately one cubic inch. This lunatic enveloping preoccupation with the trivial is one of the things that make farce funny as well as liberating. It's like watching the combat in an ant palace.Neither Mr. Caan nor Mr. Gould plays it this way, and I suspect that that was the intention of the director, Mark Rydell, as well as of the script writers, John Byrum and Robert Kaufman. If ""Harry and Walter Go to New York"" were to work at alland I'm not sure it couldHarry and Walter would have to be played straight, as believably bumbling innocents, not as a couple of leading men impersonating ineptitude and incompetence Mr. Gould can be a good comedian, but here he seems to have caught some of Mr. Caan's way of appearing to wink at the audience, as if to disassociate himself from the character.The two stars don't act, as they are perfectly capable of doing. Instead they cut-up in the desperate manner of performers appearing ""live"" on television talk shows, or of ""guest stars"" on television variety shows who can't help cracking up with laughter at jokey ad libs they've already heard 40 times in rehearsal.Tony Bill, the film's executive producer, was also one of the producers of ""The Sting,"" which makes comparisons between the two films inevitableand very unfortunate for ""Harry and Walter."" The new film, which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, features a lot of stylish interior decoration that you will see only in big-budget movies, but the comedy is inconsistent, diluted, the kind that seems to be television's unhappiest gift to theatrical films.""Harry and Walter"" has been rated PG, apparently because some of its language is what once was called bold, which isn't the same thing as obscene.",1976-06-18T05:00:00+0000

The battlehistorysurvives while the movie blows up harmlessly in a confusion of familiar old newsreel footage, idiotic fiction war movie clichs, and a series of wooden-faced performances by almost a dozen male stars, some of whom appear so briefly that recognizing them is like taking a World War II aircraft-identification test. Is that a single-wing Robert Mitchum? A modified Cliff Robertson? A rebuilt Glenn Ford?The film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, attempts to recreate the circumstances leading up to the battle of Midway Island, June 4-5, 1942, when a perilously small United States Navy task force decisively defeated Admiral Yamamoto's much larger Japanese fleet whose mission had been the invasion and occupation of Midway. It was the turning point of the war against the Japanese who lost four large carriers and never again seriously threatened American sea power in the central Pacific. It was also the battle that established beyond doubt the leading role that carriers were to play in the Pacific war.Most of these things are reported quite dutifully by the film, but for anyone seriously interested in Midway, I'd recommend a reading of the late Samuel Eliot Morison's fastidiously documented account in his ""History of United States Naval Operations in World War II.""As did ""Tora Tora Tora,"" that earlier movie disaster about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, ""Midway"" solemnly cross-cuts between the war councils, chart rooms and communications offices on the American side and those on the Japanese side, with characters, who often have to be identified by subtitles, laboriously trying to give us all of the exposition necessary to make the battle coherent.There's no way to act such roles, though Henry Fonda as Admiral Nimitz shows a certain amount of ease reading decoded messages and shaking hands with junior officers. Charlton Heston plays a fictional character who might have been stolen from some terrible movie made shortly after World War IIa Navy officer whose Navy pilot son has the bad judgment to fall in love with an American-born Japanese girl.Mr. Heston is given the movie's silliest lines, though the fact that there really was an Admiral Yamamoto doesn't exactly protect Toshiro Mifune from his share of duds. ""Ah,"" says the movie's Yamamoto when informed of Gen. Jimmy Doolittle's token air raid on Tokyo in early 1942, ""this is a blessing in disguise. There'll be no more foot-dragging by the general staff."" Small-talk among flag officers is one of the ""film's more minor problems.The major one is the battle, which is a badly edited and badly matched series of scenes made up of studio stuff, miniatures and actual battle footage that was much better used (if my memory serves me) in John Ford's 18-minute documentary, ""The Battle of Midway"" and Louis De Rochemont's ""The Fighting Lady."" Jack Smight, the film's director, and his editors also appear to repeat battle footage when it's really good. Maybe not, but it certainly seems that way.At many theaters, the film is being shown with sound effects in Sensurround, the system of low-frequency sound signals (used more effectively in ""Earthquake"") that are supposed to recreate the sense of the battle butheresimply annoy the ears. At the beginning of the movie, the producers warn that they will not be responsible for the audience's physical or emotional reactions to Sensurround. They say nothing about the audience's physical or emotional reactions to the movie itself. Producers aren't completely stupid.The film has been rated PG. It would be difficult to make a movie, even a bad one, about a battle like Midway and not show some violence or overhear some of the men using rude words to describe their occasional impatience.",1976-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Stage two softened the attitude a bit. It'd been noticed that every now and again during a Simon charade an honest observation, funny and yet not all that funny, might hit home and hit hard, that a flicker of despair, still funny and yet not all that funny, might cross the face of a figure we'd been thinking merely a cartoon. And so Simon came to be regarded as a man whose natural impulses led him to ask for a laugh at any price but who, when he tried hard enough, could rise a wee bit above himself. He could create something nearer people than parrots to deliver his yocks, could train his gags to attach themselves like creepers to the nearest solid, homely truth.

us,The Screen: Roman Polanski's 'The Tenant' Arrives,"Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) is a French citizen and he has a carte d'identit to prove it, but he has a foreign accent that puts off Parisian bartenders, concierges, policemen and landlords. Small boned and shortphysically vulnerable  Trelkovsky seems to be aware of having put off people all his life. Thus he goes to great lengths to avoid giving offense. He dresses with carea too-bright necktie might attract the attention of a small talkative child or of a friendly drunk. He answers the unaccountable rudeness of strangers with infinite patience.Trelkovsky exists. He inhabits his own body, but it's as if he had no lease on it, as if at any moment he could be dispossessed for having listened to the radio in his head after 10 P.M. People are always knocking on his walls.Trelkovsky, the hero of Mr. Polanski's striking new horror film, ""The Tenant,"" is a character who might have been invented by an Edgar Allan Poe who'd had the opportunity to read about Raskolnikov and Josef K. He's a particularly Eastern European kind of late 19th-century outsider set down in contemporary Paris. He is alsoby the end of the moviesomething of a joke, but an entirely intentional one.""The Tenant,"" which opened yesterday at Loews Tower East, is the most successful and most consistently authentic Polanski film in years, and in saying that I realize that a lot of people prefer the Polanski who turns out films more or less tailored to popular tastes, like ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby.""""The Tenant"" displays the clear-eyed narative discipline of his early ""Knife in the Water"" and ""Repulsion,"" but without the self-indulgent gimmickry that have made a lot of his later ""personal"" films, including ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""What?"", almost impossible to sit through even when the idiosyncratic talent behind them was visible.""The Tenant,"" adapted by Gerard Brach and Mr. Polanski from a novel by Roland Topor, tells the story of the strange series of occupations that take place when Trelkovsky, a filing clerk in what appears to be a library, moves into a two-room Paris apartment made vacant by the attempted suicide of the previous tenant.The previous tenant, a young woman not yet dead, was unknown to Trelkovsky, but he makes it a point to visit her in the hospital. He is fascinated by what he sees, a body swathed in bandages, one leg in a cast, only one blackened eye and the mouth visible. He has thoughtfully brought her some oranges to suck.During this visit he also meets one of the young woman's friends, an apparently sweet but enigmatic girl named Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Leaving the hospital together, they have a drink in a bar and go to a movie where, as best as one can in a theater balcony, they make love, then part.Little by little Trelkovsky becomes convinced that the other tenants in the building have somehow been responsible for the earlier tenant's suicide attempt. The concierge (Shelley Winters) either ignores him or insults him. The landlord (Melvyn Douglas) monitors his arrivals and departures. The tenants spy on him. One night a mysterious woman (Lila Kedrova) appears at his door with her crippled daughter to report that there's a conspiracy afoot to have her kicked out of the building.Little by little, too, the other tenants force Trelkovsky, against his will, to assume the identity of the now-dead earlier tenant. One morning he wakes up in full drag, missing the tooth that the dead girl was missing. At a party Trelkovsky says to a friend with a good deal of understatement, ""These days relationships with neighbors can get very complicated.""Movies about madness tend to lose me after a certain point. The tension vanishes when one realizes that any absurdity, any trick, is available to the film maker. The director and his audience must share a set of rules for what passes for ordinary behavior if suspense is to be maintained. These rules do not exist in ""The Tenant.""That ""The Tenant"" works so well is because it's not strictly about madness, though that is its narrative form. It's about emotional isolation that has become physical. The forces that occupy Trelkovsky's mind were invited in by him, the outsider.The film is superbly acted by Mr. Polanski, Mr. Douglas and Miss Winters, who might not be entirely convincing as a Parisian concierge in a realistic film, but who fits into this nightmare perfectly. The French actors, including Miss Adjani, sound as if their English dialogue had been dubbed by othersnot very intelligentlythe result being that the performances no longer seem to be strictly their own.Mr. Polanski also has a gifted collaborator in Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer whose camera plays the role of narrator, directing our attention to curious details, offering humble asides, as 19th-century authors once felt free to do without embarrassment or excuse.",1976-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,'Children of Paradise' Is Still Enchanting,"In the 1950's it seemed wonderfully complex; strange, and with a most liberating poetical ambiguity to it. I, for example, have never talked quite straight ever since.""Children of Paradise"" was the quintessential Foreign Film. Europe wasn't that close then, anyway; no cheap air faresan occasional freighter was the nearest equivalentand young people didn't travel so much. They worked for master's degrees.And there, already into its career of perpetual revival, came ""Children."" It was a ""Gone With the Wind"" of cobwebs. Its epic romance, instead of sweeping over miles of landscape was squeezed, Europelike, into the framework of a stage, the landscape all inward.These days some people are discovering, others rediscovering Marcel Carn's masterpiece. It is going through still another revival, this time at the Paris Theater. It looks to be as perennial as the Perseids.Expected and UnexpectedIt is in fact, both as expected as seeing a star fall and as unexpected. There is the scene where Jean-Louis Barrault, as the mime Baptiste in his white Pierrot costume, tries to hang himself, and surrenders his rope successively to a child wanting it for a skip rope and a woman wanting it for a wash line.Now that is a famous scene, quoted and recounted endlessly. Like some of the ""Magic Flute's"" arias it has a life of its own; and still it is impossible to watch without the small hairs' trying to walk off the back of the neck.After a quarter-century or so, a revisit to ""Children"" is cheerful and encouraging. Some things have grown fusty and cramped in it, but in general the damage of time is like the gilt flaking off a picture frame. It dates the picture within, but doesn't harm it.Some scenesthe opening street carnival, the drinkers and dancers in a smoky cafeare cluttered and overcharged. There is a certain slow and mechanical contrivance in setting out some of the characters.Not Garance, though, the fatal woman played by Arletty. We meet her protruding from a barrel filled with dark liquid. She is indeed bathing naked, as the sideshow barker has promised, but all the customers get to see is her head and shoulders, comical and stately.It is part of the film's lovely alternation of humanity and fantasy. Arletty is comic and of a practical sensuality; she is also a haunting beauty; at the end, as her carriage melts into the crowd, she has acquired some of Baptiste's elusive transparency.Baptiste goes the other way. At the start, as the drooping Pierrot on the balustrade, he is pure air. His rival, Lacenaire, says that to kill him ""would be like killing a ray of moonlight."" Gradually, passion subjects him to the laws of gravity. At the end he runs futilely after Garance's carriage like any stumbling lover with a churning gut.Even the cheerful, earthbound Fredericanother rivalhas his moment of rebellious genius. And Lacenaire, the murderer, thinks of himself as a literary figure.The main characters are both clear and shimmering. They have their particular attributes, as in any normal movie, but they also contain the possibility of being their own opposites. Reality in this film is never a matter of ""nothing but.""It is this that makes any memory of ""Children"" so complex. Complexity of this kind could fall into pretentiousness and incoherence, but it doesn'tand for a very simple reason.Mimes at the Top""Children"" is a perfectly classical and conventional story. Garance leaves her criminal protector to take up with Baptiste and work at his mime theater. His love at this point is tangled in fantasy and he loses her to Frederic, the talking actor. (A fascinating motif in the film is its theatrical hierarchy that places mimes at the top and speaking actors lower downand yet it is the mimes who are applauded by the workers in the cheap seats high up; the ""paradise"" of the title.)Garance, pressed by the police for her past associations, marries an aristocratic suitor for protection. Years pass, they all prosper, there is a brief reunion of Garance and Baptisteconsummated this timeand Garance leaves.There are side embellishments, of course, small mysteries and bits of fog. But they are scrollwork on a perfectly recognizable object. It is a big stagecoach of a movie  more than three hours along  that rumbles serviceably and creakily on a perfectly recognizable road.It is the passengers who are magic.",1976-06-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'Big Bus' Is Inexhaustible Film Comedy,"Movie comedies nowadays are like large airplanes with every conceivable flying feature except aerodynamics. They roar around the runways making the right noises, the jet engines go like a dream, the seat belts and ashtrays are flawless. And none of it lifts as much as an inch from the ground.For the first few minutes, ""The Big Bus"" gives every forced sign of being one more gag-stuffed, landbound contraption. Then there is a lurch, a bump and an almost forgotten lifting sensation. For at least three-quarters of an hour it is soaringly, achingly funny.Then it settles back down on the runway and bumps along more or less predictably. But the glow of startled gratitude lasts for quite a while.It seems evident from the start that we are in the presence of yet another genre parody or put-on. Not a mock-western or mock-detective movie this time, but a mock-Airport-Hindenberg-Grand Disaster Hotel movie.The parody involves the creation of a nuclear-powered giant bus that makes the first nonstop run from New York to Denver. Archfiends try to sabotage it, mechanisms fail, the crew is racked with personal and professional problems, the passengers are a menagerie of odd and problematical types.The conventional parody things start the movie off: the mock portentous announcements of the new invention, the heavy satire on Cape Kennedy-style launching preparations. A bomb goes off, disabling the crew and flooring the scientist in charge. Then comes the fist bump.The scientist (Harold Gould) lies there attended by a maniacally incompetent doctor. His daughter (Stockard Channing) runs up. ""He can't hear you,"" the doctor says, covering the scientist's face with a sheet. ""Of course I can hear you"" says a voice from under the sheet. ""Oh, I thought he was resting,"" the doctor says.A new driver must be found. The scene shifts to a bus drivers' bar. In comes Dan Torrance (Joseph Bologna). ""Hello, Whitey,"" he says to one colleague. ""Hello, Blackie,"" he says to another. ""Hello, Reddy, Hello Bluie, Hello, Greenie,"" he raves on. No one answers; Torrance, the best driver in the business, is ostracized. He is suspected of having eaten 110 passengers when his bus broke down in the desert.He denies it. ""I ate the seats. I boiled the floor mats like they taught us to,"" he pleads. At most, he insists, he might have eaten one foot by mistake.He is hired, in any case. The passengers assemble. They include Ruth Gordon as a housewife who has run away from home after ""50 years of cooking and cleaning and fixing the TV antenna,"" a couple celebrating their divorce, a disbarred veterinarian, a failed priest and so on.The busa successfully and comically inflated vehiclerolls off and the disasters begin. The disasters are of a more or less predictable humor. It is the characters, played with fine lunacy by such actors as Sally Kellerman, Lynn Redgrave and Ren Auberjonois, that provide the lift.In their lead roles, both Mr. Bologna and Miss Channing are fine. Miss Channing, who specializes in kooky roles, has the difficult part of straight woman, more or less. Even so, she manages to be funny just standing still and impersonating Elizabeth Taylor.The main credit for the picture, though, must go to the writers, Fred Freeman and Lawrence J. Cohen, and the director, James Frawley. They have unearthed a buried truth: Comedies can, in fact, be funny.""The Big Bus"" is playing at the Loews State I and the Sutton Theaters.

us,Simon's Breezy 'Murder by Death',"The dinner party takes place far from any point of reliable reference, on a foggy night, inside a vast, gloomy old house where one shouldn't trust the wine, the chandeliers, the thunder outside, or the oil portraits, whose eyes tend to follow the action below. The butler is blind and the cook is not only deaf and unable to speak, she also cannot read, which makes the food scarce and communication with and between the domestic help impossible.What's worse is that the host, an eccentric millionaire named Lionel Twain, is some kind of fiend. In the 1930's he was arrested for attempting to smuggle a truckload of rich white Americans into Mexico to pick melons.The guests look familiar, Strangely. They include Sidney Wang, the famous Chinese detective and a member of the Catalina police, who starts sentences saying something on the order of ""Treacherous fog, like mushrooms. . . ."" There are also Sam Diamond, the tough Frisco private eye and his secretary-mistress, Tess; the famous Belgian detective, Milo Perrier, and his chauffeur-companion, Marcel; the tweedy English amateur sleuth, Miss Marbles, and Dick and Nora Charleston, who are elegant, tall and very thin, and who act as if they invented the dry martini.The occasion is a murder, and the movie, ""Murder by Death,"" is for people who never quite remember who killed Roger Ackroyd. Neil Simon remembers enough to have written one of his nicest, breeziest screenplays, a parody murder mystery that appears to be the cheerful confession of a man who, more often than he should, has sat up until all hours of the night reading to find out who did it, and who has then promptly forgotten.""Murder by Death,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and other theaters, is Mr. Simon's fond send-up of the work of Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Earl Derr Biggers. By bringing Sam Spade into the comparatively genteel worlds of Hercule Poirot, Charlie Chan, Miss Marple and Nick and Nora Charles, Mr. Simon might appear to have mixed his genres with unforgivable lack of respect. Yet his creation, Sam Diamond, hilariously mugged by Peter Falk, is one of the principal joys of the film; he's the rude noise that shakes up the drawing room.All of the performances are good, and if some seem better than others, it may simply be the material. James Coco is very, very funny as the somewhat prissy take-off on Hercule Poirot, his toupee and his eating habits. David Niven and Maggie Smith are marvelous as Dick and Dora Charleston, though they haven't enough to do, and Eileen Brennan is an inspired hybrid of Joan Blondell and Lauren Bacall as Sam Diamond's secretary-mistress. If Peter Sellers is not quite as funny as we expect, it may be because we've seen him do his Oriental bit before. It no longer surprises.Alec Guinness is most welcome as the blind butler, but Nancy Walker isn't around long enough as the disadvantaged maid, though she almost brings down the house with one magnificent absolutely silent scream. Which leaves Truman Capote, which I suppose I can't because he plays the diabolical Lionel Twain. Mr. Capote possibly is acting, but it looks more as if he's giving us an over-rehearsed impersonation of himself as people see him on unrehearsed TV talk shows.Considering the tone and manner of ""Murder by Death,"" it would seem to be very much a Neil Simon work, but that may be to underestimate the contributions of Robert Moore, a talented theater director (""The Boys in the Band,"" ""Promises, Promises"") who is making his debut as a film director here. Whoever should get the credit, ""Murder by Death"" is as light and insubstantial as one could wish.The film has been rated PG. Naughty language did it.",1976-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'The Great Scout':Prospecting Trio Adds Fun to Western With Harmless Dirty Tricks,"""The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday"" begins well enough, with Lee Marvin winning barroom bet by picking up a rattlesnake and kissing it. It's not exactly Gable and Lombard, but the faces have the same mutual suitability.It ends well enough with a showdown punch-up between Marvin and the smoothie villain. Robert Cuip: lots of harmless dirty tricks and rolling around in the mud.Mr. Marvin is good at physical adversity. His features are shaped by a sandstorm, and it is in other moments, when the wind has blown out and it is time to register more subtle emotions that he seems excessive and out of place, like foul-weather gear slung over a drawing-room couch.The problem with ""Great Scout,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama and other theaters, is the long corrugated road between its beginning and end. So many clumsy examples of the funny western have gouged their way, square-wheeled, along it that we set our teeth anticipating each joke as if it were a pothole.There were once three partners who prospected a gold claim. The first, Jack Colby  played with likable deviousness by Mr. Culp  absconded with the proceeds, made a fortune and went into politics. The other two bumped along, scavenging a living.One is Sam Longwood (Mr. Marvin). The other. Joe Knox, is a loud-mouthed Indian half-breed whose idea of revenge on the white race is to infect it with syphilis. Knox, is not so much played as pillaged by Oliver Reed. He makes him winsome.The plot has these two trying in various ways to steal their money back from Colby: one of their schemes being to kidnap his wife. The wife has a foul tongue and low sexual habits, but, such is the power of graceful acting, Elizabeth Ashley makes her the movie's closest approach to civil comedy. Kay Lenz who plays Cathouse Thursday, a young camp-follower of Longwood's tries hard for the same thing but misses.Rough language, and feet sticking out of beds at non-missionary angels, earn this movie its PG rating.",1976-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Logan's Run,' a Science-Fiction Fantasy","It is the dubious premise of ""Logan's Run,"" the science-fiction fantasy that opened yesterday, that by the middle of the 23d century overpopulation and air pollution will have rendered life on the surface of this planet impossible and that the strictly controlled, drastically reduced number of survivors will live near Washington in a city that sort cf looks like the Houston Astrodome on the outside but inside is a Hollywood special-effects expert's dream.Within this huge bubble life is simple, automatic and perfect. Everything is ruled by a computer, including the weather. Babies are born from machines. Pleasure is the principle. At age 30 each citizen goes through ""the ritual of the carousel,"" thus to be reborn in a spectacular display of levitation and laser beams, though it's just a fancy way of executing the old-timers and getting rid of the ashes.If you know your science fiction at all, you know that no perfect world of the future is perfect. This one has a major flaw. A lot of people aren't convinced that the carousel actually renews them, and they try to run away to escape execution. ""Logan's Run,"" written by David Zelag Goodman and directed by Michael Anderson, is the story of one of the city's policemen, a man named Logan (Michael York), who himself becomes one of the ""runners"" who had earlier been his quarry.Just why and for what particular purpose Logan makes his run is anything but clear after you've sat through nearly two hours of this stuff. ""Logan's Run"" is less interested in logic than in gadgets and spectacle, but these are sometimes jazzily effective and even poetic. Had more attention been paid to the screenplay, the movie might have been a stunner.This ""Logan's Run,"" which is quite different from the novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton, is harmless fun enlivened by a couple of sequences that are as good as the entire film should have been.One, early in the movie, shows us the the carousel ceremony, which is a kind of aerial ballet, fireworks display and skeet shoot. The other is a sequence in which Logan and his girl, played by Jenny Agutter, explore the ruins of Washington, which, though overgrown by vines, could easily be restored to its ancient splendor with the help of a pair of pruning shears, a lawn mower and a little plaster and paint. Peter Ustinov shows up in this sequence giving a benignly fussy performance as a sweet old hermit whose dearest wish is to meet people.The film's PG rating apparently has reference to some nudity and a very blurry sequence in which Mr. York and Miss Agutter pass in slow-motion through a dimly lit pleasure palace whose patrons try to persuade the couple to join in. They emerge untampered with.",1976-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Omen' Is Nobody's Baby,"The best thing that can be said about ""The Omen"" is that very few viewers will want to walk out. They will stay, but they will feel foolish.A member of the ""Exorcist"" family, it is a dreadfully silly film, which is not to say that it is totally bad. Its horrors are not horrible, its terrors are not terrifying, its violence is ludicrouswhich may be an advantagebut it does move along.Movies about Satanic possession do not depend for their effectiveness on making their central device convincing. They should, however, make all the details surrounding this device so plausible that when the Thing appears the audience's skepticism has gone to sleep. It was this peripheral credibility that gave ""Rosemary's Baby"" its strength.""The Omen,"" which opened yesterday at the National, Loews Cine and other theaters, takes its details with no seriousness at all. It is not a put-onit is terribly solemn, in factbut it often seems like one.There are miles of plot. It deals with the problems of a rich and privileged Americanhe happens to be Ambassador to Great Britain, which is the source of a great deal of the movie's incredibility  whose wife gives birth to a dead baby. A devil-possessed priest slips them another baby who is destined to grow up to rule the world in the name of Satan.The baby becomes a lovely little boy, but when he is 4 years old or so, a mysterious black dog turns up. In quick order the boy's nursemaid hangs herself and a mysterious new nursemaid, a malevolent Mary Poppins, arrives to replace her.Things begin to go badly wrong and the Ambassador, played by Gregory Peck, can't figure out why. A mad-looking priest arrivesnot the one who supplied the baby and warns him that the child is the Antichrist. Soon the priest is impaled by a spire falling off a church.The Ambassador begins to be convinced. Joined by a photographer, played by David Warner, he goes to Italy to try to find the origins of his adopted child, and from that point the disasters begin to mount.From the moment Mr. Peck comes home after a hard day and tells his wife, played by Lee Remick, that they're off to be Ambassadors, the film's working-level reality is hopelessly scratched. This must be the most unattended American emissary to Great Britain since John Jay. Scenes in which he and his wife look for a housethe United States Ambassador in London has an official residenceor in which he runs around London by himself are quite impossible.Yet the movie is reasonably well-paced. We don't have time to brood about the sillinesses of any particular scene before we are on to the next. There is not a great deal of excitement, but we manage to sustain some curiosity as to how things will work out. ""The Omen"" is the kind of movie to take along on a long airplane trip.",1976-06-26T05:00:00+0000

We sometimes hear that essays are an oldfashioned form, that soandso is the last essayist, but the facts of the marketplace argue quite otherwise. Essays of almost any kind are so much easier for a writer to sell now than short stories, so many more see print, it's odd that though two fine anthologies remain which publish the year's best stories, no comparable collection exists for essays. Such changes in the reading public's taste aren't always to the good, needless to say.

I've always thought with the typical short  sightedness with which the present regards the pastthat this impulse to prettify arose from hypocritical piety or disdain for his audience on the part of the bowdlerizer. But now, after reading Herbert Lieberman's latest novel, City of the Dead, I understand little better that under certain circumstances it may prove necessary to draw the veil over particular developments in a story. For there are possibilities in Mr. Lieberman's plot that I regarded with a fear surpassing esthetic terrorthat is, while reading City of the Dead I became nervous not so much about the story he was shapingthough I was nervous enough about thatas about the kind of book he might be writing and the limits to which he would confine himself.

us,Film:'Old Gun' Misfires:French Doctor Turns Into Nazi Executioner,"In ""The Old Gun,"" a simple and possibly effective story has been ruined by mass of directional and acting self-indulgence.A French film, which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater. It is set in the last months of the German occupation of France. A doctor in a provincial hospital, a comfortable family man whose aid to the Resistance is a matter of careful balancing, turns into a one-man death squad after a group of drunken and demoralized German soldiers murders his wife and daughter.Prowling through the cellars and back halls of his chateau, where the Germans are bivouacked, the doctor exterminates them messily, one by one. His anguish and desperation are set in a framework of ironic futility: Even while he is going about his mission the Resistance has taken over the village.The movie has a cast, but for all practical purposes it seems to have only one actor in it: Philippe Noiret. Mr. Noiret is a decent actor; his performance as the soft, plump, comfortable doctor whose fire is betrayed only by tiny sparks until it bursts into conflagration is sometimes funny, sometimes moving. It is overdone at times.It is not, however, as horribly, crushingly overdone as the use of the camera by the director, Robert Enrico, makes it seem. The camera virtually never leaves Mr. Noiret's round; puffing face; when it does, it is only to take in a slightly larger view of his round, puffing figure. We are smothered by him.Mr. Enrico's major mistake, however, is in using what must be at least a dozen flashbacks to tell his story. Almost at the beginning, we meet Romy Schneider, as the doctor's wife, burned to a cinder. The flashbacks are a way of seeing more of her, but they are no way to make a movie.Once he has come upon his dead family, the doctor can hardly take a few steps or make a move without everything shifting back to scenes that range from a childhood hunt, to the courting of his wife, to a confusing moment during a village festival in which she takes refuge, for no apparent reason, in a cellar.Whatever coherence or interest the main action might have is shattered by the technique. The intention may be to render even more dreamlike and unreal the doctor's unaccustomed essay into violence; it becomes unreal, all right, and enormously irritating.",1976-06-30T05:00:00+0000
