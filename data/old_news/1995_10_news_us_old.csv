Her name was Gertrude Himmelfarb, but she was called 'Bea.' . . . I noticed her for some weeks before approaching her and asking her out. In truth, I was already in love with her without even knowing her. . . . Thus began what my friend Daniel Bell later described as 'the best marriage of our generation,' a judgment I have no quarrel with.

In this translation by Patrick Creagh, Mr. Vassalli glories in minutiae, describing in fine degree the superstitions and religious corruption of the era -- and what 17th-century provincial life looked, sounded and even smelled like. It was a crude, noisy, brutal world, one where ""human life bubbled and seethed,"" where ""the work in the fields was hard, grueling in fact, and entertainment was nonexistent,"" save for gossip and procreation and the occasional witch burning. Into the village of Zardino, in the flatlands of Lombardy, comes a beautiful girl named Antonia, adopted from an orphanage by a childless peasant couple. Resented by the local women, she is also desired by the local men. Appearing not long after is Don Teresio Rabozzi, a hysterical young priest who is determined to wring the devil out of Zardino through a fierce regimen of prayer and donations, and maybe buy himself a parish besides. Within this narrative, Mr. Vassalli distills his extraordinary story -- extraordinary not for what happens to poor, doomed Antonia, but for the intricate formula of events and attitudes that produces her fate.

us,AN END TO WRATH,"Euripides might have had a hand in this book. In 1942, Eric Lomax, a British signals officer in Singapore, became a Japanese prisoner and later was sent with others to Thailand, to build an impossible railroad into Burma, beyond the infamous bridge on the River Kwai. He was assigned to a shop crew, not to the rail laying that killed thousands. His mates built secret radios to keep abreast of the war, and he, a train enthusiast from youth, drew a detailed map of the planned rail route. Perhaps inevitably, as he says in THE RAILWAY MAN: A POW's Searing Account of War, Brutality and Forgiveness (Norton, $22), in late 1943 camp guards found the radios and the map. Mr. Lomax and other officers were savagely beaten with clubs for hours. Then, after days of grilling about his map, he was put through excruciating water tortures and spent the rest of the war starving and diseased, cooped in filthy cages. In later years he buried most of this in his mind, at hideous personal cost, but cherished real hatred for a Japanese interrogator who had acted as the translator. In 1989 a friend showed him a Japan Times story about one Takashi Nagase, a veteran who had spent his life atoning for Japanese war atrocities and who mentioned his own role in the water torture of a man who had drawn a map of the Burma-Siam railroad. Mr. Lomax, recognizing his interrogator in the newspaper's picture, felt an ""icy joy""; he might sneak up and kill him. In fact, almost 50 years after he was tortured, he and his wife arranged to meet Mr. Nagase and his wife at the bridge on the Kwai. Eventually, overwhelmed by the depth of Mr. Nagase's lifelong grief and knowing that this man's Buddhist beliefs made it imperative that he be forgiven before he died, Mr. Lomax wrote a letter forgiving him everything and handed it to him, and the two old men parted comforting one another. In Athenian tragedy there was a point, after the horror and pity passed, when for some viewers the presence of a god was manifest -- not seen on stage, but there, terrifying and exalting. A few plays of Euripides can still let you feel a hint of that sublimity. It is obvious that all this is far from Mr. Lomax's mind. He has a straightforward story and he tells it quietly and with dignity. But at the end one feels the old dramatic shock: an amazed, even fearful suspicion that the curtain on eternity was pulled back slightly, for a moment. D. J. R. BRUCKNER",1995-10-01T05:00:00+0000

She said I could have a gerbil, so I got a tarantula. Tell me what is the basic difference?

But she has a total attack and she has another total attack that I put eyeball stickers on my bed, IT IS MY BED BUT SHE HAS A TOTAL ATTACK, because it was her brother's bed or her cousin's bed or someone of her family's bed WHO IS OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER SON WHO JUST WANTS TO PUT HIS EYEBALL STICKERS WHERE HE WANTS EXCEPT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE LIVES IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP. Same goes for tape and nail holes in the wall. I go, ""Mom, how am I supposed to put up my posters, then?"" and she goes, ""Oh, I'll buy you a bulletin board."" THAT BULLETIN BOARD RIGHT THERE THAT I FILLED UP IN THREE SECONDS! I said, Forget it, man, this is boag, I'm using tape and then she has another total attack and makes me sign a Family Contract that when I leave for college I will personally paint my own room and sand down the tape marks or whatever it is you do with tape marks, which I will have to figure out because as you have noticed there is hardly no wall showing. That is my goal. Total posters. Including the ceiling. Oh, that's another thing. You notice the green light bulbs, right? At first when I bought them WITH MY OWN MONEY, MOM, she totally freaked because ""Green light bulbs, green light bulbs? The neighbors will think you are growing drugs!"" I go, Mom, what kind of drugs do you grow with green light bulbs? And she freaked and we had to have a family meeting where my dad was even there, which is totally weird because I think the total times my dad has even been in my room is like around zero AND NOW HE GETS A VOTE ON MY LIFE? Mom was freaking because she said it brought the value of the house down because my bedroom used to be in the front where the world could see it so that is how I scored this room that used to be my sister's. It smelled like a girl for around a month, during which I couldn't have no one over, but it was worth it for the green light bulbs. Don't they make you feel so peaceful? Wait. Listen to this song. Isn't it the perfect combination? I want to just listen to my station and lie in the peaceful green light and let my tarantula free. Its name is Dana, for this girl Dana Speers at my school who I swear to God looks just like a tarantula but in a cool way. No one I know knows I named it Dana. They think I named it Boris. It would be embarrassing if people knew. My mom would get all happy. ""Oh, a girl in my son's life!"" So if she comes in call it Boris. Actually, I snuck the actual Dana Speers up here to meet Dana Speers the tarantula. Dana Speers is a more interesting girl than normal. You wouldn't even think she's a girl from the way she is. She doesn't make no one nervous. I have sat right here and the actual Dana Speers has sat right where you are and we let the tarantula Dana Speers walk from my hand onto her hand, you know, that thing of letting a tarantula walk on you? And it was a trip because no hairs fell off the tarantula Dana Speers's abdomen when we did that. Which shows you what I said about the actual Dana Speers. And she, the actual Dana, has these superlong eyelashes and eyebrows, which some people think is freaky because it does look slightly monstery because there's hair all around her eyes, even right here in the corner par,t which I think looks insanely cool and you know that thing where if you get an eyelash from someone you can wish on it? And maybe even an eyebrow hair counts, too, I don't know. I just know for sure that one eyelash fell off of the actual Dana Speers when she was last over, but it would have been too weird of me to go for it while she was sitting there, so I waited until after she left and I am still looking for it because I got a really good wish I want to make and that's why I don't want my mom to vacuum in here. That and also she might suck up my tarantula.",1995-10-01T05:00:00+0000

The author is best known as a novelist, but he had a brief career as a politician. He explores both roles in this memoir, which describes his formative years as well as his 1990 run for President of Peru. The campaign was a debacle, but many predicted Mr. Vargas Llosa would use the experience to write ""a good book,"" Alan Riding said here last year. ""And he has."" HEADING WEST By Doris Betts. Scribner Paperback, $12. Nancy Finch, an unmarried librarian, is the kind of woman nothing happens to. That is, until her vacation in North Carolina is interrupted by an armed man, who kidnaps her and proceeds to drive toward the Grand Canyon. Issues of responsibility and accountability arise as Nancy realizes she has become a silent partner in her own abduction. Just restored to print, this 1982 novel offers pleasures ""infinitely more subtle, complex and memorable than being scared in your armchair,"" Beth Gutcheon wrote in these pages when it was published. She added, "" 'Heading West' is a book of great delights."" Ms. Betts's collection THE ASTRONOMER AND OTHER STORIES (Louisiana State University, $11.95) is also in print again. Many kinds of innocence are lost in these pieces, including, in the title novella, that of a retired man who has assumed he is beyond fantasy and desire. In 1966 our reviewer, Benedict Kiely, said the author ""displays equally a rich imagination and disturbing vision."" A NEW WORLD: An Epic of Colonial America From the Founding of Jamestown to the Fall of Quebec By Arthur Quinn. Berkley, $15. A historian details the many ways in which early America's idealism was either squelched or nonexistent. (John Smith's character, he notes, was not exactly as it is portrayed in Disney's ""Pocahontas."") ""His book is a scrumptious reminder of the pleasures of historical writing that rises to the level of literature,"" George F. Will wrote in the Book Review last year. ARABIAN NIGHTS & DAYS By Naguib Mahfouz. Translated by Denys Johnson-Davies. Anchor/Doubleday, $12. Many folk and fairy tales have a dark side, and this Egyptian Nobel laureate finds one throughout ""The Arabian Nights."" (Scheherazade's marriage to a lecherous murderer was hardly a happy ending.) His retelling can be read as a ""daring and biting critique of the corruption of power in the modern Middle East,"" one critic said earlier this year. The same publisher has reissued Mr. Mahfouz's novel THE HARAFISH, translated by Catherine Cobham ($11), which depicts the fate of numerous generations of a family whose roots are in what Americans might call the underclass (and Arabs call the harafish). In 1994 one reviewer described it as ""a whirling dervish of a good yarn."" More Arabian tales can be found in DAMASCUS NIGHTS, by Rafik Schami, translated by Philip Boehm (Scribner Paperback, $11). In 1959 a great Syrian storyteller, struck mute by witchcraft, can regain his voice only if he is given seven unique gifts -- which turn out to be stories. The author ""writes with wisdom, wit and lightheartedness,"" Malcolm Bradbury said here in 1993. TRUE NORTH: A Memoir By Jill Ker Conway. Vintage, $12. The author, who wrote of her childhood in the Australian outback in ""The Road From Coorain,"" turns here to her adult challenges in a different wilderness: academia. She ""has come a long way from the parched fields"" she grew up in, Carol Brightman wrote in these pages last year. A woman's journeys are also the basis of AN UNSPOKEN HUNGER: Stories From the Field, by Terry Tempest Williams (Vintage, $10). This Utah-based writer and naturalist explores her own connections to the earth and those of women like Georgia O'Keeffe and Rachel Carson. In 1994 our reviewer, John Hanson Mitchell, praised the book's ""dark strength and power."" ONE TRUE THING By Anna Quindlen. Dell, $6.99. The narrator, a young journalist named Ellen Gulden, has to confront both the loss of her mother and the accusation that she ended her ill parent's suffering. As the novel depicts Kate Gulden's final days, ""the reader cannot help caring about her, and mourning her death,"" Frederick Busch said in the Book Review last year. HENRY ADAMS By Ernest Samuels. Belknap/Harvard University, $16.95. This book, a revision and abridgment of the author's 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning three-volume work, shows its subject to be more appealing as a historian and writer than as a human being. ""It is a complete success"" and ""a remarkable feat of the biographer's art,"" Hugh Brogan wrote in these pages in 1989. OUT OF SILENCE: An Autistic Boy's Journey Into Language and Communication By Russell Martin. Penguin, $11.95. Speaking is so natural to most people that it is rarely remembered that every conversation is the result of a complex neurological process. The author writes of just how difficult it was for language to take hold in his autistic nephew's seething brain. The result is ""deeply moving,"" F. Gonzalez-Crussi said here last year. THE TRIBE OF TIGER: Cats and Their Culture By Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12. Felines, by no means all aloof or solitary, are revealed in their complexity by the author of ""The Hidden Life of Dogs.""

us,DIARY,"HOTSHOTS How to Lose a Billion What a glorious world they've made for themselves, those hotshots with fancy computers and sleek pocket phones and grim faces, juggling the world's billions with a deftness that chess masters would envy. No one would dare pester these Masters of the Universe with nerdy questions like, ""Are you, O Great One, by any chance making up those numbers?"" Apparently no one asked Toshihide Iguchi that question -- or at least looked very hard for an answer. For last week authorities charged that Mr. Iguchi, a bond trader at Daiwa Bank, had gone into an 11-year spiral of falsifying records in a desperate attempt to recoup trading losses -- and wound up a staggering $1.1 billion in the red.... So do bond traders tend to do things in a big way? It seems so. For while most baseball fans are content to grumble and munch if their boys let them down, on Thursday a Chicago bond trader ran onto the field and attacked a Cubs pitcher who'd just given up a home run. Ah, sports! INVESTIGATIONS Following Archer-Daniels Money The plot thickens at Archer-Daniels-Midland. Mark Whitacre -- you remember: the Archer executive who turned Government informant and raised cries of price-fixing -- has apparently admitted to crimes related to company money he received, and though no plea deal has been reached, he is cooperating with an inquiry. But what was this money? The company says it was embezzled, but some executives are offering another script entirely: that Archer paid millions -- illegally and off the books -- to a number of executives through foreign bank accounts. If that's true, the ""embezzlement"" becomes a scheme to let top executives indulge in that all-too-common pastime: evading income taxes. What's true? Stay tuned. EXECUTIVE PAY Ted Turner, Wage-Earner What made Ted Turner give up the power of running his own show? Surely it wasn't money. There's only so much one person can spend in this world. But at a certain level -- way, way up beyond paying the bills -- salary figures take on a life of their own. Mr. Turner's pay is clearly up in that never-never land -- especially for a No. 2 executive. With options and such corner-office goodies, he's said to be making more than $100 million over five years -- far more even than Gerald Levin, his boss at Time Warner. Then again, even that fantasy paycheck seems almost incidental, for Mr. Turner is getting $2.6 billion in Time Warner stock. BUDGET CUTS They're Saying the 'S' Words No, that rumbling you heard last week was not an earthquake, or New Jersey being replaced by a golf course. It was -- brace yourself -- the budget-cutters saying the ""S"" words. Normally, politicians would kick babies before they'd cut Social Security, but these are not normal times -- austerity is such a passion that babies across the land are surely being named ""Newt Smith"" or ""Budget Cut Jones."" So sure enough, senators from both parties suggested shaving cost-of-living increases -- a panel of economists just said, after all, that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Pat Moynihan said $281 billion could be saved over seven years that way. ""The money is sitting there,"" he said, ""asking to be picked up."" If they pick it up, though, will they be pummeled by retirees? DEBT COLLECTION Your Taxes or Your Kneecaps If Congressional Republicans have their way, it won't just be the I.R.S. knocking on your door wondering if, pretty please, you could pay your taxes. It could be practically anyone. The legislators want to turn over some dunning tasks to private bill collectors to see if they can do it better -- raising all sorts of nasty privacy issues. It's all, of course, part of the whole budget mess -- the Administration wanted to increase the I.R.S. budget nearly 10 percent; Republicans want to cut it. To Margaret Milner Richardson, the I.R.S. Commissioner, this budget-trimming is misguided, for it's accepted wisdom that tax enforcers bring in far more than their salaries. ""No sound business person,"" she said, ""would not spend money to make money."" TRANSPORTATION A Slippery Road There must be a better way, drivers mutter as they inch through exhaust-fouled air, past perpetual construction, to drop coins in a state toll basket. But are we ready for private highways? Well, ready or not, they're here, with a 14-mile road linking Dulles Airport and Leesburg, Va., opening this weekend -- the first privately financed toll road built this century. With the public sector ""just tapped out,"" as one executive put it, this may sometimes be the only way to build a road. But just think what today's maniacal marketers could do with this. There could be rival thruways, each bombarding drivers with ads for, say, wider lanes, smoother surfaces, better views, free meals, toll sales -- perhaps even drive-by movies, but that sounds risky. EDUCATION Cheaper Than a Luxury Car The bad news: college costs keep rising faster than inflation -- 6 percent last year, the College Board said last week. With total costs at top colleges nearing $30,000, and with Federal grants and loans tight, students face ""a deeply mortgaged future,"" said the head of the College Board. But there's good news too. ""There are some tremendous bargains out there,"" said an official of the American Council on Education. Two years ago, ""61 percent of all American college students spent less than $3,000 in tuition and fees."" EXECUTIVES An 'Odd Meal' at I.B.M.? It takes a tough man to make a tender computer? No, that doesn't work. A PC in every pot? Oh, never mind. Let I.B.M. figure it out. Louis Gerstner certainly knew what he was doing last week when he picked J. Bruce Harreld, president of Boston Chicken, as chief strategist. Still, one analyst couldn't resist saying, ""That's an odd meal -- cookies with chicken, sprinkled over silicon chips."" THE PAPAL VISIT The Priceless and the Profane You can't put a price on something like seeing the Pope, an experience presumably far beyond worldly matters.

But Mom always comes in with the bogus excuse of ""Here are some clean socks and underwear, I'll put them in your drawer."" As if I can't get my own socks and underwear from the laundry room. But no, she just needs any excuse to come into my room and yell, ""This room looks like a tornado hit it!"" As if she has ever seen anything hit by a tornado. And then she's coming back dragging the vacuum cleaner, as if she has the right to vacuum my room! I go, ""MOM, NEVER VACUUM IN HERE!"" I got too many important things of life on that floor. Stuff that dropped that I'll need later. And my tarantula, which I swear to God hates my mom so much that the hairs fall off its abdomen, which is what happens to tarantulas when they get freaked, and Mom is always freaking my tarantula with the vacuum. She said I could have a gerbil, so I got a tarantula. Tell me what is the basic difference? I use the same fish tank that leaked all over the dresser and wrecked it, which I had to hear about for 5,000 years because that was her dresser when she was a kid. LIKE IT'S MY FAULT THE FISH TANK LEAKED AND I DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL ALL THE WATER WAS OUT! WHAT ABOUT MY FISH, MOM, HUH? So that's why the dresser is all warped. It took a while for the water to leak out. I just thought it was evaporating superfast. I thought it was like a freak of the environment of my bedroom. CAN I HELP IT IF IT WAS LEAKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE DRESSER I NEVER LOOK AT, MOM? And then you'd think that if it was already wrecked she wouldn't care if I put my eyeball stickers on the mirror and the wood, right? A normal person would normally think, It's Already Wrecked So What's the Dif. But she has a total attack and she has another total attack that I put eyeball stickers on my bed, IT IS MY BED BUT SHE HAS A TOTAL ATTACK, because it was her brother's bed or her cousin's bed or someone of her family's bed WHO IS OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER SON WHO JUST WANTS TO PUT HIS EYEBALL STICKERS WHERE HE WANTS EXCEPT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE LIVES IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP. Same goes for tape and nail holes in the wall. I go, ""Mom, how am I supposed to put up my posters, then?"" and she goes, ""Oh, I'll buy you a bulletin board."" THAT BULLETIN BOARD RIGHT THERE THAT I FILLED UP IN THREE SECONDS! I said, Forget it, man, this is boag, I'm using tape and then she has another total attack and makes me sign a Family Contract that when I leave for college I will personally paint my own room and sand down the tape marks or whatever it is you do with tape marks, which I will have to figure out because as you have noticed there is hardly no wall showing. That is my goal. Total posters. Including the ceiling. Oh, that's another thing. You notice the green light bulbs, right? At first when I bought them WITH MY OWN MONEY, MOM, she totally freaked because ""Green light bulbs, green light bulbs? The neighbors will think you are growing drugs!"" I go, Mom, what kind of drugs do you grow with green light bulbs? And she freaked and we had to have a family meeting where my dad was even there, which is totally weird because I think the total times my dad has even been in my room is like around zero AND NOW HE GETS A VOTE ON MY LIFE? Mom was freaking because she said it brought the value of the house down because my bedroom used to be in the front where the world could see it so that is how I scored this room that used to be my sister's. It smelled like a girl for around a month, during which I couldn't have no one over, but it was worth it for the green light bulbs. Don't they make you feel so peaceful? Wait. Listen to this song. Isn't it the perfect combination? I want to just listen to my station and lie in the peaceful green light and let my tarantula free. Its name is Dana, for this girl Dana Speers at my school who I swear to God looks just like a tarantula but in a cool way. No one I know knows I named it Dana. They think I named it Boris. It would be embarrassing if people knew. My mom would get all happy. ""Oh, a girl in my son's life!"" So if she comes in call it Boris. Actually, I snuck the actual Dana Speers up here to meet Dana Speers the tarantula. Dana Speers is a more interesting girl than normal. You wouldn't even think she's a girl from the way she is. She doesn't make no one nervous. I have sat right here and the actual Dana Speers has sat right where you are and we let the tarantula Dana Speers walk from my hand onto her hand, you know, that thing of letting a tarantula walk on you? And it was a trip because no hairs fell off the tarantula Dana Speers's abdomen when we did that. Which shows you what I said about the actual Dana Speers. And she, the actual Dana, has these superlong eyelashes and eyebrows, which some people think is freaky because it does look slightly monstery because there's hair all around her eyes, even right here in the corner par,t which I think looks insanely cool and you know that thing where if you get an eyelash from someone you can wish on it? And maybe even an eyebrow hair counts, too, I don't know. I just know for sure that one eyelash fell off of the actual Dana Speers when she was last over, but it would have been too weird of me to go for it while she was sitting there, so I waited until after she left and I am still looking for it because I got a really good wish I want to make and that's why I don't want my mom to vacuum in here.

us,COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT,"KEY GAMES OF TOP TEAMS No. 2 Ohio State (4-0) at Penn State (3-1) Penn State could not run or protect the passer or stop the pass in last Saturday's 17-9 loss to underdog Wisconsin, and its 20-game winning streak died. Ohio State is good, and its defense is opportunistic. No. 3 Florida (4-0) at No. 24 L.S.U. (3-1-1) L.S.U. struggled against South Carolina before it tied the score on a touchdown pass with 66 seconds left. Florida was good but not overwhelming against Mississippi, but its offense had a possession advantage of 39 minutes 20 seconds, and it has the edge here. No. 11 Northwestern (3-1) at No. 4 Michigan (5-0) Two teams that did not figure to be among the Big Ten's elite. Michigan has too many weapons, including quarterback Brian (son of Bob) Griese, who made his first start last week and passed for two touchdowns. No. 9 Iowa (3-0) at No. 19 Michigan State (2-1-1) Two more Big Ten contenders. Todd Schultz, starting for Iowa because Tony Banks was injured, passed for two touchdowns against Boston College. Michigan State rolled up 610 yards against New Mexico State, a soft touch. EAST Pittsburgh (2-3) at Boston College (1-3) Pitt is in deep trouble because Billy West, its heavy-duty tailback, broke his left leg and is lost for the season. Princeton (3-0) at Brown (2-1) An even game matching Marc Washington of Princeton (219 yards and 3 touchdowns rushing last week) and Jason McCullough of Brown (324 yards and 5 touchdowns passing). Penn (3-0) at Columbia (1-1-1) Penn, with 24 straight victories, has too many weapons, and Columbia's defense is too inconsistent. MIDWEST No. 22 Oklahoma (3-1) at Iowa State (2-2) Even if Troy Davis of Iowa State reaches his nation-leading rushing average of 228 yards a game, his Cyclones should be blown out. Missouri (2-2) at No. 21 Kansas State (4-0) Kansas State has beaten Temple (0-4), Cincinnati (1-4), Akron (1-3) and Northern Illinois (2-3). Missouri seems no threat, either. SOUTH No. 10 Virginia (5-1) at North Carolina (2-2) Both teams like to pass, but Mike Groh of Virginia (335 yards last week) is too good. Mississippi State (2-3) at No. 18 Auburn (3-1) This game was postponed from Thursday night because of Hurricane Opal. Auburn has a 223-yard rushing average and a four-wideout passing attack. North Carolina State (1-4) at No. 20 Alabama (3-1) In shutting out Georgia, Alabama scored on returns of a blocked field goal (90 yards), interception (26 yards) and fumble (25 yards). No. 25 Maryland (4-1) at Wake Forest (1-4) This should be easier for quarterback Scott Milanovich of Maryland, still rusty from a four-game gambling suspension. Mississippi Valley (0-4) at Grambling (2-2) Eddie Robinson of Grambling goes for his 400th coaching victory in his 54-year career. SOUTHWEST No. 8 Texas A&M (2-1) at Texas Tech (1-2) Texas Tech lost to Penn State by a point and Baylor by 2 points, both on the road, but the Aggies should be too much. No. 15 Tennessee (4-1) at Arkansas (4-1) Tennessee should win if it stops Madre Hill, who rushed for 200 yards and two touchdowns last week. FAR WEST Kansas (4-0) at No. 1 Colorado (5-0) Colorado has beaten Wisconsin, Texas A&M and, on backup John Hessler's five touchdown passes, Oklahoma. Kansas has not played a tough team yet. No. 16 Notre Dame (3-2) at Washington (3-1) In losing to Ohio State, Notre Dame dropped punts, muffed snaps and fumbled on a kick-return reverse. Washington gave up 488 yards in beating weak Oregon State. No. 8 Southern California (4-0) at California (1-3) Southern California has too many weapons, notably Keyshawn Johnson with 12 straight 100-yard receiving games. No. 13 Stanford (3-0-1) at Arizona State (2-3) Stanford has no big rusher or passer or defense, just good timing and special teams that have returned two kickoffs for touchdowns. MISMATCHES Miami (1-2) at No. 6 Florida State (4-0) In recent years, this game often had bearing on the national championship. Florida State's offense is frightening (59.5 points and 634.5 yards a game), and Miami is small, young and inexperienced. Temple (0-4) at No. 17 Syracuse (3-1) Syracuse's freshman quarterback, Donovan McNabb, is becoming a sophisticated option runner. Temple has lost 12 straight.

The island itself -- a Japanese colony before World War II, then controlled by the Nationalist Chinese with violent repression during the cold-war years -- has come to seem his most treasured character. ""City of Sadness,"" shown at the New York Film festival in 1989, tells Taiwan's story as a family saga. The poetic ""Puppetmaster,"" shown at the festival two years ago, layers Taiwan's history with the biography of an aged puppet maker. Now, in ""Good Men, Good Women,"" Mr. Hou depicts Taiwan in an even more complex way, blending history with fiction, and juxtaposing the present with recent memories. He even includes a fact-based, black-and-white movie within this elegantly shot film. ""Good Men, Good Women"" will be shown as part of the New York Film Festival this afternoon at 2.

What I and the other grandchildren knew was that even though our grandfather indulged us with candy bars, teased us by grabbing our legs under the table and exclaiming, ""Snakes! Snakes!"" and taught us everything from diving to poker playing, he was quick to anger and a little unpredictable. It was therefore with horror that I watched my 9-year-old friend Susan Clayton rip one of the bridge cards while we were playing a forbidden game of slapjack. The point of the game was to slap one's hand down on the pile whenever a jack was turned over, and thereby claim the pile. The game was forbidden because we'd torn a card before. I had, in fact, climbed on a chair, and then the dining-room table, in order to get the cards down from the dish rail near the ceiling where my grandfather had put them. Now another card, from the deck bought to replace the damaged one, was torn. My grandfather believed in corporal punishment, and my grandmother, too. I was not too old to be switched, at 9. I had recently been switched for leaving my glasses in the mailbox, where they were broken by a heavy package. I gathered up the cards, including the torn one, and stuffed them back in their case beside the second, similar deck that was also ruined, then I climbed the chair and the table, and set them on the dish rail, exactly in the spot and the position where I'd found them. It was the middle of the afternoon, late summer. My friends and I went outside to find something else to do.",1995-10-08T05:00:00+0000

As a boy he was apprenticed to a local clockmaker, and when he had learned his trade, he moved to Waltham, Mass., to work at the watch factory there. A few years later, he opened his own shop, where, for the rest of his nearly century-long life, he repaired fine watches and heirloom clocks, manufactured and adjusted scientific instruments for professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and even set Admiral Peary's chronometers for his North Pole voyages. A rigorously ordered, meticulous man of exceptional intelligence, he was a widower after 1934, and by the late 1940's he seemed a solitary survivor of a long-gone time, when moral standards were stricter, clearer and somehow more easily kept than now. He was like one of his own handmade mahogany grandfather clocks, while the rest of us -- his four daughters, three sons-in-law and dozen grandchildren -- were mass-produced, unreliable tin wristwatches that had to be set and reset constantly against his perfect movement.",1995-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Corporate America is appropriating health care in this country with the sole purpose of making profit, by brutally squeezing doctors and hospitals financially and by restricting, and even denying, high-tech care to patients. The irony of H.M.O.'s aggressively seeking Medicare patients is evident from the fact that Medicare pays less than 70 percent of actual cost.

us,STILL AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT,"In a sense, all of life -- every action -- is a transgression. A child's undulled sensitivity picks up the cosmic background of danger and guilt. A child is in constant danger of doing something wrong. I was most severely punished, as I fallibly recall it, for being late in getting back home. At least once and perhaps several times my mother, her face red with fury, pulled a switch from the stand of suckers at the base of the backyard pear tree and whipped me on the backs of the calves with it, when I had been, let's say, a half-hour late in returning from the playground or some friend's house a few blocks away. Fear for my safety was, I suppose now, behind this stinging discipline, but at the time it seemed mixed up with her fear that, by playing late with some other boy, I would be on the road to homosexuality. She didn't like to see me wrestling with other boys, even on our own property. No doubt she was right, taking ""homosexual"" in its broadest meaning, about young male roughhousing, but to my prepubescent self her anxieties seemed exaggerated. She didn't like to see my father, a 6-foot-2 schoolteacher with, as far as I could see, normal tendencies, put his hand on his hip either. But whatever the psychological roots of her (as I saw it, with eyes full of tears) overreaction, it did its work on my superego: I have an unconquerable dread of being late for appointments or returning home later than promised, and what modest heterosexual adventures were mine in adulthood received the slight extra boost, from deep in my subconscious, of my mother's blessing.

As a boy he was apprenticed to a local clockmaker, and when he had learned his trade, he moved to Waltham, Mass., to work at the watch factory there. A few years later, he opened his own shop, where, for the rest of his nearly century-long life, he repaired fine watches and heirloom clocks, manufactured and adjusted scientific instruments for professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and even set Admiral Peary's chronometers for his North Pole voyages. A rigorously ordered, meticulous man of exceptional intelligence, he was a widower after 1934, and by the late 1940's he seemed a solitary survivor of a long-gone time, when moral standards were stricter, clearer and somehow more easily kept than now. He was like one of his own handmade mahogany grandfather clocks, while the rest of us -- his four daughters, three sons-in-law and dozen grandchildren -- were mass-produced, unreliable tin wristwatches that had to be set and reset constantly against his perfect movement.

us,The Trials of Dr. Sheppard,"Early on the morning of July 4, 1954, in the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village, Marilyn Sheppard was beaten to death as she slept in an upstairs bedroom of her lakefront home. Around dawn, her husband, Sam Sheppard, called the Mayor, a family friend, and reported the crime. Sheppard claimed he had fallen asleep downstairs, was awakened by an intruder and knocked unconscious twice: once upstairs, and again as he struggled with a man fleeing along the beach. There was no sign of a break-in. The police caught Sheppard, an osteopath, lying about an affair with a lab technician, and he refused to take a lie detector test. Prosecutors were goaded by a shrieking press. One Cleveland newspaper ran 399 stories in six months, with headlines like ""WHY ISN'T SAM SHEPPARD IN JAIL?"" The trial judge failed to screen the jury from such reports and allowed the news media to pack the courtroom, with 20 reporters sitting in front of the bar. After a two-month trial, Sheppard was convicted of murder. In 1966, condemning the ""carnival atmosphere,"" the United States Supreme Court granted Sheppard a new trial. He was represented by F. Lee Bailey, and he won acquittal. In MOCKERY OF JUSTICE: The True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case (Northeastern University, $24.95), Cynthia L. Cooper, a lawyer, and Sam Reese Sheppard, the Sheppards' son, provide a slanted but comprehensive review of this cause celebre. Nothing here proves Sam Sheppard's innocence. The authors soft-pedal his alcoholism and increasingly bizarre behavior. Mr. Sheppard even briefly raises a discredited theory that his mother was killed by a lover of her own. That's more than irresponsible; it's sad. ALLEN D. BOYER",1995-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,STILL AFRAID OF BEING CAUGHT,"In a sense, all of life -- every action -- is a transgression. A child's undulled sensitivity picks up the cosmic background of danger and guilt. A child is in constant danger of doing something wrong. I was most severely punished, as I fallibly recall it, for being late in getting back home. At least once and perhaps several times my mother, her face red with fury, pulled a switch from the stand of suckers at the base of the backyard pear tree and whipped me on the backs of the calves with it, when I had been, let's say, a half-hour late in returning from the playground or some friend's house a few blocks away. Fear for my safety was, I suppose now, behind this stinging discipline, but at the time it seemed mixed up with her fear that, by playing late with some other boy, I would be on the road to homosexuality. She didn't like to see me wrestling with other boys, even on our own property. No doubt she was right, taking ""homosexual"" in its broadest meaning, about young male roughhousing, but to my prepubescent self her anxieties seemed exaggerated. She didn't like to see my father, a 6-foot-2 schoolteacher with, as far as I could see, normal tendencies, put his hand on his hip either. But whatever the psychological roots of her (as I saw it, with eyes full of tears) overreaction, it did its work on my superego: I have an unconquerable dread of being late for appointments or returning home later than promised, and what modest heterosexual adventures were mine in adulthood received the slight extra boost, from deep in my subconscious, of my mother's blessing.

The promised waiting time at this fancy new garage: 2.5 minutes PUBLISHING Those Business Week Papers Let's see. First Procter & Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which seemed to bolster P.&G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts. CHARITY Throwing Big Money at Cancer It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift ever to medical research. ""It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon,"" Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. AUTOS Speaking Out at Chrysler The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to ""trash"" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler, ""has no real knowledge"" about what's happening and is merely out for ""personal gain."" He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control.",1995-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Corporate America is appropriating health care in this country with the sole purpose of making profit, by brutally squeezing doctors and hospitals financially and by restricting, and even denying, high-tech care to patients. The irony of H.M.O.'s aggressively seeking Medicare patients is evident from the fact that Medicare pays less than 70 percent of actual cost.

Crew, arrived from Tacoma, Wash., like a politician on a carefully choreographed victory lap, doling out bear hugs at a Queens elementary school in front of television cameras he had invited to record the visit. And the city provided its own inimitable kind of welcome. [ Page A1. ] The Republicans who control the State Senate joined Governor Pataki in endorsing much of Mayor Giuliani's plan to abolish the New York City Board of Education. [ B3. ] Dr. Crew's decision to spend $1.6 million on motivational training for teachers in Tacoma was the subject of debate, and drew charges of conflict of interest. [ B3. ] As he made one last visit to the schools he would be leaving behind, friends said that Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines was having some regrets about leaving. [ B3. ] Police officials told a special commission set up by the Mayor that the school system's security division was unequipped to protect students. [ B2. ] NEW YORK CITY POLICE RECONSTRUCT SHOOTING OF OFFICER A police officer who was shot four times in an East Village bodega was caught in a hail of gunfire between the police and drug dealers, the police said, and two of the bullets that struck him were fired by fellow officers. Investigators are trying to reconstruct a robbery gone awry. [ B4. ] ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE CORRUPTION DROP Allegations of police corruption in New York City fell by 17 percent the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1994, according to a Police Department survey. But officials said they were still troubled by the high concentration of complaints in minority neighborhoods plagued by drug dealing. [ B4. ] TURNING TABLES ON CITY WELFARE ADVISER Most of the questions were taken directly from the pages of a new city handbook for welfare inspectors. But the questioners in front of the apartment of Richard J. Schwartz, the senior adviser to Mayor Giuliani on welfare reform, were not with the city. [ B4. ] BRONX DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOCUS OF SIT-IN Family members of two young men killed in confrontations with the police staged a boisterous sit-in outside the Bronx District Attorney's office, demanding prosecution of officers in the deaths of their loved ones. [ B4. ] CHINATOWN LEADER SENTENCED IN MURDER The powerful former president of a Chinatown fraternal and business organization was sentenced to life in prison for a murder and racketeering conviction that prosecutors called their first victory against the top ranks of Chinese organized crime in New York City. [ B4. ] ADDRESS BOOK NAMES TERROR SUSPECTS An address book belonging to the wife of a Palestinian political leader being held in New York City contains the names of several suspected terrorists in the Middle East, an F.B.I. document says.

us,COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT,"KEY GAMES OF TOP TEAMS No. 1 Florida (5-0) at No. 16 Auburn (4-1) In drubbing Mississippi State, Auburn got 274 yards passing from Patrick Nix and 162 rushing from Stephen Davis. It has upset Florida the last two years, but Florida should have too much now. No. 2 Ohio State (5-0) at No. 17 Wisconsin (2-1-1) Another big test for Ohio State, which faces one almost evey week. Last Saturday, the Buckeyes upset Penn State on Bobby Hoying's passing (24 of 35 for 354 yards), Eddie George's rushing (105 yards) and big plays. No. 4 Northwestern (4-1) at No. 19 Minnesota (3-1) For 23 years, Northwestern has averaged two victories a season. This year, it has beaten Notre Dame and Michigan. As Coach Gary Barnett said after the upset of Michigan, ""I dream of those things, but it's hard to pull them off."" No. 10 Tennessee (5-1) vs. No. 20 Alabama (4-1) at Birmingham, Ala. Peyton Manning should be the difference. In beating Arkansas, Tennessee's sophomore quarterback completed 35 of 46 passes for 384 yards and 4 touchdowns. EAST No. 11 Notre Dame (4-2) vs. Army (1-2-1) at East Rutherford, N.J. The Irish needed three big plays in the last three minutes to beat Washington. This should be easier, even with its two best tailbacks injured. Eastern Michigan (4-1) at No. 21 Syracuse (4-1) Although Syracuse's injured tailback, Malcolm Thomas, will not play, the Orangemen will be the toughest foe of the season for Eastern Michigan. This looks like a blowout. West Virginia (2-3) at Boston College (2-3) Boston College plays a tougher schedule than its Big East rival and moves the ball better (199 yards rushing against Pitt). It held Pitt to minus 11 yards rushing. Lafayette (1-3-1) at Princeton (4-0) Princeton can run the ball (132 yards a game for Mark Washington alone) and stop the run, allowing only 100.3 rushing yards a game. Lehigh (3-2) at Columbia (2-1-1) Columbia upset Penn with an opportunistic defense. Now it must stop the passing of Bob Aylsworth (21 of 31 for 291 yards in beating Bucknell). Dartmouth (2-2) at Yale (2-2) Dartmouth's defense is fine, and it can win unless its shaky offense keeps turning the red zone into a dread zone. MIDWEST Indiana (2-3) at No. 6 Iowa (4-0) Iowa should win, especially since Indiana's quarterback, Chris Dittoe, is out for two weeks with an injured knee. Penn State (3-2) at Purdue (2-2-1) This could be easy for Penn State, but the Nittany Lions are not the smooth powerhouse of last year. Iowa State (2-3) at No. 8 Kansas (5-0) Kansas by a ton. After Mark Williams had passed for 299 yards in a 40-24 upset of Colorado, he said, ""We knew we would win, so it wasn't an upset."" SOUTH No. 18 North Carolina (3-2) at Georgia Tech (3-2) Is Carolina really better than Virginia, its upset victim last week? Probably not. It should get tested here. Penn (3-1) at William & Mary (4-2) The Quakers's 24-game winning streak is over, and they face a buzzsaw in a stronger Division I-AA foe. Rutgers (1-3) at Miami (1-3) Two big disappointments in the Big East, but Miami has better prospects short range and long range. SOUTHWEST Texas (4-1) vs. No. 22 Oklahoma (4-1) at Dallas As usual, a nice matchup, with the edge to Oklahoma. Texas gave up 428 yards to a poor Rice team. No. 12 Kansas State (5-0) at Oklahoma State (1-4) Although Kansas State has been playing patsies, it has three straight shutouts and has allowed only six possessions inside its 20 yard line. FAR WEST Washington (3-2) at No. 15 Stanford (4-0-1) Stanford, a prospective doormat in the Pacific 10, is off to its best start since 9-0 in 1951. This should be a real test. Washington State (3-2) at No. 13 Southern California (5-0) Chad Davis of Washington State beat Oregon State, completing 21 of 28 passes for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns. Not this time. Arizona (3-2) at No. 24 U.C.L.A. (3-2) U.C.L.A. can pass. The last time out, its freshman quarterback, Cade McNown, went 18 for 22 for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns against Fresno State. MISMATCHES Missouri (2-3) at No. 5 Nebraska (5-0) Nebraska has won 16 straight from Missouri. The Huskers are six-touchdown favorites and may win by more. Wake Forest (1-5) at No. 7 Florida State (5-0) Florida State has won 12 straight, and Warrick Dunn is averaging 184 yards rushing. Look for a blowout by six or seven touchdowns.

Jerome (Corky) Corcoran, an Irish-American businessman of modest means, has never felt at home in the world since the murder of his father when he was 11. In this novel he seeks the meaning behind another death, the suicide of a young black woman. The result is ""an engrossing, moving study of desperate, lonely and lost souls,"" James Carroll said here last year. LOUISA MAY ALCOTT: A Modern Biography By Martha Saxton. Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15. There was much more to Louisa May Alcott than can be gleaned by reading ""Little Women."" Although this book, originally published in 1977, portrays her as eager to sacrifice for her peculiar parents, it also reveals her as a person whose emotional needs had little to do with self-denial. It is ""an absorbing, powerful interpretation of a tormented woman,"" Patricia Meyer Spacks wrote in the Book Review. More of Alcott's complexity emerges in THE SELECTED LETTERS OF LOUISA MAY ALCOTT, edited by Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy (University of Georgia, $19.95). In her correspondence she is strong, spirited and cheerful, able to write prolifically despite the demands placed upon her. This is ""a brave and vivid life in letters,"" Barbara L. Packer said in these pages in 1987. Just how brave and vivid can be seen in A MARBLE WOMAN: Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott, edited by Madeleine Stern (Avon, $11). The two novellas and three stories in this volume, originally titled ""Plots and Counterplots,"" represent the Gothic adult fiction Alcott wrote for added income and, one suspects, pleasure. As our reviewer, Diane Johnson, put it in 1976, ""The heroines are forceful, independent, sexually demanding, smoke dope and don't do housework.""",1995-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Then only a decade or two out of prolonged isolation, the little kingdom seemed to invite the visitor to step back a few centuries. There was the pristine green of the Katmandu Valley, a shade more luminous than even that of English meadows. There were the street scenes that, set against a backdrop of medieval buildings, possessed the color and vitality of a Bruegel painting. The air, a heady cocktail of wood smoke, incense and farmyard aromas, betokened adventure; and such was the visibility that come October and the retreat of monsoon clouds, the high ranges of the Himalayas materialized beyond the valley's rim as a white wall of splendor.

They and 40 other adolescents appear in Adrienne Salinger's IN MY ROOM: Teenagers in Their Bedrooms (Chronicle, paper, $16.95). For most of them, life seems as narrow as their twin beds. Ms. Salinger, who teaches art media studies at Syracuse University, met them at malls, restaurants or gyms, but photographed them in their bedrooms because, as she writes, bedrooms ""become the repository for our memories and the expression of our desires and self-image."" All the teen-agers are pretty weirded out (unlike, of course, previous generations), as the grown-up world seeps down into theirs. Take Krissy P., a cherubic-looking girl who rambles on about ganja cookies. Many of the young people have suffered because of their parents. Carlos C.'s divorced when he was a child and his father died of AIDS. Then Carlos moved in with his ""Uncle Bill,"" a family friend who is gay and has a male roommate. Yet Carlos is one of the few adolescents smiling in the book (his room is a comfortable mess) and the only one who seems approachable and kindly. ""I grew to love my uncle, and I can relate to him better than anybody,"" he says. Adult problems may be stumbling more and more into teen-agers' lives, but at least the young people can still retreat to their rooms. DULCIE LEIMBACH",1995-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN THE WELL-MADE PLACE,"AS we approach the millennium bombarded with forecasts that the electronic revolution is poised to dematerialize the world into byte-sized digital signals, our instinctive response is to reach for an antidote in the intense physicalities of the home. In fact, the home may be evolving into the last preserve of the well-made object. Whether it is through the geometry of a perfectly proportioned window or through the texture of a worn leather sofa, well-made things reassure us that the material world still thrives. While we moderns are more accustomed to mass-produced than custom-made, we still crave the luxury of richly realized spaces and things. The following interiors share an attitude about excellence that guarantees that traditional or contemporary, spare or layered, they are exciting to experience. In a Manhattan apartment, the interior designer John Saladino applied his knowledge of classical proportions to manipulate and enrich every surface. With their craftsmanlike obsession with details at every scale, Peggy Deamer and Scott Phillips introduced a high level of conceptual integrity to a modern house in the Hamptons. Layers of brilliant color and texture endow the home of Christine Van Der Hurd and David Hurd with visual depth and complexity. Johnny Grey, a designer-philosopher, has brought ideas about furniture and finishes from the ateliers of 18th-century craftsmen into the kitchen. These homes proclaim and celebrate the many ways it is possible to live in a well-made place.",1995-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,DIARY,"OMERTA, JAPANESE STYLE Who Knew What When? The Daiwa Bank's loss of $1.1 billion because of one employee's unauthorized trading in U.S. Treasuries left egg all over the bank's top executives. Now the stain has spread: six weeks weeks before Daiwa notified American regulators of its problem, it told the Japanese Government -- which decided this was not information it had to share with Washington. At best, Tokyo's secrecy was a serious breach of protocol at a time when the two Governments were trying to sort out various financial issues -- and when concerns about the shaky underpinnings of some Japanese banks had reached the point that American institutions were charging a premium for lines of credit extended to Japan. A phone call between Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Japan's Finance Minister, Masayoshia Takemura, seemed to do little to mend the fence: Treasury officials said the Japanese had expressed regret; the Japanese insisted that they had not apologized and that American regulators were upset because of ""cultural differences."" In any event, said the Vice Minister of Finance, Kyosuke Shinozawa, it was Daiwa's responsibility to inform the United States, not the ministry's. THE HIGH-TECH YO-YO Which Way to Jump? In the latest pang for all those heavily invested in high technology, the sector took a nose dive on Monday, with the Nasdaq composite down 2.7 percent, precipitated by Novell's announcement of anticipated lower earnings, followed by Motorola profits that disappointed some investors. By Tuesday's opening, the Dow had been dragged down 65 points. But then investors dived back in, and yet again The Selloff had become The Buying Opportunity. By week's end the markets were setting or flirting with records. LABOR Flight Attendants Win a Round In a rare success for organized labor, arbitrators awarded the flight attendants union at American Airlines a 17 percent salary increase over four years and maintained vacation time at current levels. The 20,000 flight attendants at American struck just before Thanksgiving 1993; they returned to work five days later after President Clinton twisted the arm of Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of AMR, which owns the airline, until he agreed to arbitration. The arbitrators did grant American the right to reduce staffing on some flights. GOODBYE Manzi Bails Out at I.B.M. In the credit markets, three months is short term. But that's not how Jim P. Manzi, chief executive of Lotus Development, sees things. After quickly giving in to I.B.M.'s takeover offer last summer, Mr. Manzi pledged to stay with Big Blue for ""the long haul."" Ninety-nine days later, he has walked away, saying he was not ""the right person"" to run a division at I.B.M., where no one seemed to be crying at the news. If Lotus's software geniuses were to follow Mr. Manzi out the door, that could change quickly. CYBERSPACE Roadworks Ahead Weaknesses in the structural integrity of the Internet could allow a criminal to divert documents or transactions transmitted over computer networks, researchers at the University of California warned. The problem requires more than a hot patch on the information superhighway, the experts say, urging businesses to contain their enthusiasm for digital commerce until adequate safeguards are in place. BANKING New Week, New Merger Forging a combination that would dominate banking in metropolitan Philadelphia, Core states Financial agreed to acquire Meridian Bancorp for $3.2 billion in stock. As banking mergers grew to fever pitch earlier this year, Meridian held out. But Corestates turned up the heat after an unsuccessful pass at the Bank of Boston. Corestates said the combined company would close or sell 115 branches and trim nearly 2,000 jobs, about 10 percent of its staff. BORDER WAR Coffee Exchange to Stay Put Grabbing the gold ring offered by New York city and state officials, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said it would remain in Manhattan and build a new home, rather than move to Jersey City as it had planned.

We live in a country where the worst of human traits -- laziness, violence and irrationality -- are seen as defining characteristics of those of African descent. This makes my being a mixed-race person whose ethnic identity is black somewhat complicated. There is a dissonance between who I say I am -- a proud black man trying to do something positive with his life -- and who society says I am. Yet I feel strong, and I embrace my black heritage.

us,A Shoe Of One's Own,"WHAT: The Air Swoopes basketball shoe for women from Nike Inc., the company that brought Air Jordan to American locker rooms. Named after Sheryl Swoopes, the former Texas Tech all-American, 1993 Collegiate Player of the Year and a member of the 1994 Goodwill Games gold-medal basketball team. Arriving in stores this week, for the suggested retail price of $85. THE BIG DEAL: Nike last named a shoe for an athlete 10 years ago, when it introduced the Air Jordan basketball shoe for men, named after Michael Jordan. The shoe propelled Nike to dominance in the athletic-shoe market. Ms. Swoopes, considered one of the best college players ever, man or woman, is the first female athlete to have a shoe named in her honor. Robin Carr-Locke, a spokeswoman for Nike, said the line was part of the company's commitment to women's sports. ""And we thought the name was cool,"" she said. But there is also a growing interest in women's basketball and a new generation of Sheryl Swoopes and Rebecca Lobo wannabes. HER AIRNESS: Born March 25, 1971, in Brownfield, Tex. Nicknamed the Texas Tornado, Ms. Swoopes (rhymes with hoops) scored 47 points to lead the Red Raiders to the N.C.A.A. championship in 1993. She averaged 23 points a game with a professional women's team in Italy, but left after three months -- homesick and unpaid. Ms. Swoopes, a six-foot shooting guard, is a member of the United States national team that has been in training for the 1996 OlympicGames. Shoe size: 10 1/2. THE HARD SELL: To promote its latest commodity, Nike set up a toll-free number -- (800) 650-6936 -- so that fans can call to hear Ms. Swoopes talk about her new shoes and life on and off the courts. A sample: ""It's probably one of the same old stories you heard before -- only girl in the family, growing up, playing with my two older brothers, got beat up all the time, they didn't want me to play because I was a girl."" THE LOOK: No delicate pinks or baby blues here. The shoe comes in black with a white stripe and red Nike logo for winter, and white with black stripe and red Nike logo for spring. (""Black is a symbol of toughness to me,"" Ms. Swoopes said.) Designed with input from Ms. Swoopes, the shoe has a basketball encircled by a signature S at the top of the tongue and a big ""S"" on the sole. A midfoot stability strap with structural stitching was specifically designed with Ms. Swoopes's flat, narrow feet and weak ankles in mind. HANG TIME: When Ms. Swoopes skies for a slam dunk, her opponents on the hardwood will see only the bottoms of her shoes. That ""S"" in your face stands for Swoopes.

Thirty or forty other contestants must have also sung it, and always, at the bravura finish, there was a whopping surge of delight at the sheer power-theatrics of the song.

Still, no matter how far into weirdness Mr. Gifford wanders, his characters often remain less bizarre than those we see in the tabloids.

Many short chapters later, it closes with talk about an elderly woman decapitating her daughter. In between, characters lose limbs and lives and say things like ""You don't cry over anything you have to give up, because you eventually must give up everything."" Much of the narrative makes little sense, a trait for which Mr. Gifford is commonly criticized. Sailor and Lula, the lead characters from his best-known novel, ""Wild at Heart,"" randomly appear: ""To be 18 years old zooming along in a terrific car with an almost perfect girlfriend who can't hardly get enough of you on a breezy spring afternoon in the South was just about it, thought Sailor Ripley. . . . And he was glad as hell he had the good sense to realize it."" Indeed. Mr. Gifford's characters face the ridiculousness of life with existential gusto -- and in this, at least, there is perfect sense. MARK LINDQUIST",1995-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Most of the 4,700 employees losing their jobs will start getting notices today. In January 1994, GTE said it would cut 17,000 jobs -- nearly a quarter of its telephone operations workers -- over three years, mostly through layoffs. By the end of this year, about 12,000 will have been cut. Telephone operations employment has dropped from 100,000 in 1988 to 68,000. The company took a $1.8 billion charge because of the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 1993. GTE has said it expects to save $1 billion a year in expenses. (AP) HEALTHSOUTH AGREES TO ACQUIRE CAREMARK UNIT The Healthsouth Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the orthopedic rehabilitation business of Caremark International Inc. for $127.5 million. Healthsouth said Caremark Orthopedic Services Inc., has more than 120 outpatient centers in 13 states. The company expects revenues of nearly $80 million this year. Healthsouth, based in Birmingham, Ala., had revenues of $1.1 billion last year and currently operates nearly 600 outpatient and rehabilitation centers. Caremark is based in Northbrook, Ill. (Dow Jones) S.E.C. REVIEW DELAYS GENENTECH's RESULTS Genentech Inc., a unit of Roche Holding Ltd., said yesterday that it had delayed the release of its third-quarter results as a result of discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the accounting for its severance agreement with G. Kirk Raab, a former president and chief executive of Genentech. In July, Genentech announced Mr. Raab's ouster, citing his attempt to secure a $2 million personal loan guarantee from Roche, which owns 66 percent of Genentech's stock and has the option to buy the rest. In August, Roche extended its option for shares of Genentech. Genentech previously said it expected to incur charges against third-quarter earnings for its agreement with Roche and for its severance with Raab. ""We don't want to have to change these again, so we decided to conclude the discussions with the S.E.C. before we report our earnings,"" a spokeswoman said. (Reuters) PENTAIR TO BUY FLECK CONTROLS AND FRENCH UNIT Pentair Inc., a maker of power tools and lubrication systems, agreed yesterday to buy Fleck Controls Inc. for about $130 million. Fleck Controls, based in Brookfield, Wis., makes valves for residential water softeners and water-conditioning systems for businesses. The deal includes Fleck Europe, the privately held company's subsidiary, based in France. Pentair, based in St. Paul, did not disclose Fleck's annual sales but said the company was profitable. Pentair sold its paper operations in the second quarter to focus on other businesses. It had 1994 sales of $1.3 billion and has about 8,700 employees. Pentair's stock rose $1.875 to $47.875 in Nasdaq trading. (Reuters) AMERICAN EXPRESS TO KEEP GLOBAL BANKING UNIT The American Express Company has ended talks with potential buyers for its global banking unit and has decided to keep the operation, which caters to wealthy clients, the company said yesterday. The company said it had been in talks with several large United States and foreign banks about selling American Express Bank. The unit also serves other banks around the world. Its revenues have lagged behind in recent quarters. American Express shares slipped 25 cents yesterday, to $44.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. (AP) LEVITZ LOSES MONTGOMERY WARD INVESTMENT OFFER The Montgomery Ward Holding Corporation has decided against investing in Levitz Furniture Inc., the companies said yesterday, leading to a selloff in the stock of Levitz, the nation's largest furniture store chain. Levitz's shares tumbled $1.375, or 24.4 percent, to $4.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Montgomery Ward, the privately owned retailer based in Chicago, concluded that its goals and objectives could not be achieved with an investment in Levitz, the companies said in a joint statement. Levitz, based in Boca Raton, Fla., has cut about 1,000 jobs since January. Savings are expected to reach $20 million a year. Levitz has 132 furniture stores in 25 states. (Reuters) TEXAS UTILITIES STOCK RISES AFTER DIVIDEND CUT Shares of the Texas Utilities Company jumped yesterday after the company took an expected dividend cut and wrote off $802 million in impaired assets when it announced its third-quarter earnings on Friday. The electric utility's stock climbed $1.375, to $36, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company cut its quarterly dividend to 50 cents from 77 cents a share and at least four Wall Street firms raised the company's ratings. Texas Utilities, an electricity provider based in Dallas, reported a quarterly loss of $441.7 million, or $1.96 a share, because of the write-off of uncompleted coal-fired generating units, coal reserves and other assets. (Reuters) MICROSOFT TO TEST PRODUCT SALES ON INTERNET The Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that it was starting a pilot program to test sales of software over the Internet. The company said it was in negotiations with a group of several retailers for a test of electronic sales that will begin shortly and run through the end of the year. Microsoft products that will be for sale at wholesale prices as part of the program include Microsoft Word and Microsoft Flight Simulator. But analysts said the experiment would have little appeal, because of the long download time required for most programs on standard telephone modems. ""The reality is that very few people buy software electronically, especially the first copy,"" said Jeffrey Tarter, editor and publisher of Softletter, an industry newsletter. (Reuters) SYMS SHARES DIVE AS BUYBACK OFFER WITHDRAWN The Syms Corporation's stock fell nearly 17 percent yesterday after its chairman and chief executive, Sy Syms, withdrew his offer to take the company private, saying it would cost too much. Shares of Syms, a discount apparel retailer based in Secaucus, N.J., fell $1.50, to $7.50. On Aug. 30, Mr. Syms and the other shareholders, including his daughter, Marcy Syms, president of the company, agreed to buy company shares they did not already own for $8.75 each. At that price the buyout would have cost about $31 million. The Syms family owns about 80 percent of the company.

us,MOVIES THIS WEEK,"Some of the choice films on television this week are sleepers. Hollywood isn't depicted as the usual jaded jungle in Jack Sher's FOUR GIRLS IN TOWN (1956). The sensible, balanced tone of this unpretentious yarn about aspiring starlets was a mild jolt back then; it's a nice surprise now. The appealing quartet are Elsa Martinelli, Julie Adams, Marianne Cook and Gia Scala, flanked by George Nader and Sydney Chaplin. There's a super, haunting score by Alex North -- Monday at 4:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics. Fans of the occult should pounce on Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), a strange, riveting mystery sleeper set in Kansas (of all places) with no stars and not much of a budget. A pretty young woman (Candace Hilligoss) drives off a bridge, into a river. Next, she's calmly walking toward a distant, large tent with lights and music. Your move -- Tuesday at 9 P.M. and 1 A.M. on SCI-FI. James Stewart's strong performance is the reward of Andrew V. McLaglen's SHENANDOAH (1965). He's a widowed southern pacifist caught up in the Civil War through his family. The persuasive cast includes Doug McClure, Rosemary Forsyth, Patrick Wayne and Katharine Ross -- Monday at 9 P.M. on the movie map with a small boat and a cast of exactly three: Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka (in photo) and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Hang on; Polanski makes very little go a long way -- Sunday at 9 P.M., Friday at midnight on CUNY. For amusing nostalgia, try a blissfully brisk and tacky old Fox musical spotlighting Alice Faye -- a spoof of radio glory titled SING, BABY, SING (1936) which she does, nicely. The songs are neat and her colleagues are game: Adolphe Menjou and Gregory Ratoff. And Patsy Kelly and Ritz Brothers never hurt any picture. Sidney Lanfield directed -- Wednesday at 8 A.M. on Cinemax. HOWARD THOMPSON",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,They're Speaking English Up There Now,"All the characters in Thomas Mann's masterpiece THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (Knopf, $35) come considerably closer to speaking English in John E. Woods's version than they did in its predecessor, by H. T. Lowe-Porter, first published by Knopf in 1927. Lowe-Porter's apology -- ""better . . . an English version . . . done ill than not done at all"" -- was exaggerated, but his vocabulary was wholly Victorian, and he missed Mann's voice. Mr. Woods makes Mann talk much as we do, if always more intelligently, and he captures the irony and humor in all but a few passages. Little things count greatly. Here the words chosen for medicines, food, furniture, gestures and sounds put us in familiar surroundings, which makes the artificiality of Hans Castorp's situation in the sanitarium even more ominous. When despair breathes on his neck as he lounges in a loggia (Lowe-Porter) we hardly notice; when it startles him as he sits on a balcony (Mr. Woods) we are shocked. For a larger comparison, look at the ""Operationes Spirituales"" section at the center of the novel -- the historical, theological and philosophical argument that opens the fatal battle between Leo Naphta and Settembrini. Mr. Woods captures perfectly the superior but not malicious tone of the author; Lowe-Porter gets little of it. Of course, the pleasure of going through any translation is to catch lapses, and in a work so long and learned there are chances to mock any version. For instance, do we know more about Settembrini's appearance when Mr. Woods has him wear an ""ineluctable petersham coat"" than we did when Lowe-Porter clad him in an ""inevitable pilot-coat""? This garment is meant to reveal something of the man's politics and philosophy; it was often the garb of free thinkers in European cartoons and drawings early in this century. We would know it instantly if the translators just called it a peacoat. D. J. R. BRUCKNER",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Most people would choose Fagles's, not merely because his work is admirable in itself but because they feel there is more in all the others that comes between us and Homer: they interpose Jacobean, Augustan, Victorian opacities.

us,F.Y.I.,"Do Trains Wait? Q. I take the 1/9 train from the Upper West Side to Times Square every day. Sometimes the 2/3 express seems to wait for passengers from the local in the morning, sometimes not. When am I most likely to find a train waiting? A. Nighttime is the right time, said Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority. During the morning and evening rush hours, train operators are instructed not to wait for incoming locals or expresses on the opposite track. But at night the schedule is designed to allow transfers between trains. It may seem as though the trains are waiting in the morning simply because there are more trains, Mr. Seaton said. There is no communication between trains regarding a transfer, so if you catch one at rush hour, you can chalk it up to luck. Only Temporary Q. I noticed a new bright blue street sign at the corner of 52d Street and Fifth Avenue reading ""Liz Claiborne Avenue."" I thought honorary street names were saved for great benefactors. A. You can't notice it now because it's gone. The sign was put in place Aug. 17, opening day for the new Liz Claiborne store at that corner. It came down last month. Liz Sherfin, a spokeswoman from the Mayor's office, said that such temporary signs are often put up to mark ""significant"" events, including business events. The honoree pays the $250 cost, which includes the sign's production and installation. Most temporary signs are granted a shelf life of one month. Jury Duty Calls Q. Each time the two-year grace period for jury duty ends, and sometimes before, I start getting summoned to duty -- two, three, four times a year. In spite of all my letters to Centre Street, I keep getting called for the wrong times: I'm a graduate student and cannot serve during the school year. Am I just randomly unlucky? Is there no limit to the number of times I can be called? A. Right on both counts. You may be randomly unlucky, and as long as you maintain permanent residency in New York, there is no limit to the number of times you can be summoned for jury duty. But if your letters have yielded no satisfaction, your best bet may be to go to the New York County Clerk's office and deal with the situation in person.",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

English translators of the Bible in our century have concentrated on two related and equally misguided goals: to make the ancient text more accessible to modern readers and to make its meanings perfectly transparent. In an effort to achieve the former aim, translators have repackaged the idioms and syntax of the Bible in a pedestrian English style that wanders uncertainly between the language of the daily newspaper and that of a bureaucratic manual. In pursuit of clarity, what is pungent and concrete in the Hebrew is made bland and abstract, and the mystery and purposeful ambiguity of the original evaporates in explanatory paraphrase masquerading as translation.

us,F.Y.I.,"Do Trains Wait? Q. I take the 1/9 train from the Upper West Side to Times Square every day. Sometimes the 2/3 express seems to wait for passengers from the local in the morning, sometimes not. When am I most likely to find a train waiting? A. Nighttime is the right time, said Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority. During the morning and evening rush hours, train operators are instructed not to wait for incoming locals or expresses on the opposite track. But at night the schedule is designed to allow transfers between trains. It may seem as though the trains are waiting in the morning simply because there are more trains, Mr. Seaton said. There is no communication between trains regarding a transfer, so if you catch one at rush hour, you can chalk it up to luck. Only Temporary Q. I noticed a new bright blue street sign at the corner of 52d Street and Fifth Avenue reading ""Liz Claiborne Avenue."" I thought honorary street names were saved for great benefactors. A. You can't notice it now because it's gone. The sign was put in place Aug. 17, opening day for the new Liz Claiborne store at that corner. It came down last month. Liz Sherfin, a spokeswoman from the Mayor's office, said that such temporary signs are often put up to mark ""significant"" events, including business events. The honoree pays the $250 cost, which includes the sign's production and installation. Most temporary signs are granted a shelf life of one month. Jury Duty Calls Q. Each time the two-year grace period for jury duty ends, and sometimes before, I start getting summoned to duty -- two, three, four times a year. In spite of all my letters to Centre Street, I keep getting called for the wrong times: I'm a graduate student and cannot serve during the school year. Am I just randomly unlucky? Is there no limit to the number of times I can be called? A. Right on both counts. You may be randomly unlucky, and as long as you maintain permanent residency in New York, there is no limit to the number of times you can be summoned for jury duty. But if your letters have yielded no satisfaction, your best bet may be to go to the New York County Clerk's office and deal with the situation in person.",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'Things Nobody Else Would See',"Paradoxes abound in UNTITLED (Aperture, $50), the third volume of Diane Arbus's photographs and the only one devoted to a single subject -- the mentally retarded. Most of these pictures have never been exhibited or published before. Arbus began taking them in 1969 and continued until her suicide in 1972. Of this work she once wrote: ""They are blurred and variable, but some are gorgeous. FINALLY WHAT I've been searching for."" These images are gorgeous, if gorgeous can be defined as both unsettling and ecstatic. Arbus's daughter Doon Arbus (who edited the book with Yolanda Cuomo, a designer) explains in an afterword: ""She believed there were things nobody else would see unless she photographed them. . . . She wasn't talking about who or what she saw, but about the experience of seeing it and the power of her photographs to make the experience visible."" Every image is a variation on that theme -- whether it's a pouty little boy sticking his thumb in his eye or a line of dumpy masked women looking as if they're waiting to get past the gates of hell. Nobody photographed less ""beautifully"" than Diane Arbus; nobody photographed more memorably. Such pictures give us an unyielding sense of our own limits -- limits that can be raised only by death.

From the age of 12, Wilson wrote, he felt that he was ""outgrowing that form of literature.""

Like a microwave oven, the sun just as quickly re thaws the highlands each day. But for the Incas, who considered themselves direct descendants of the sun, there was more to the sun's power than just its warmth.

So my sense of the verbal, intellectual and sonic fidelity of Everett Fox's profoundly informed new version is hardly authoritative, but I can at least compare his work with the voluminous suggestions of my own early guides.

The sensible, balanced tone of this unpretentious yarn about aspiring starlets was a mild jolt back then; it's a nice surprise now. The appealing quartet are Elsa Martinelli, Julie Adams, Marianne Cook and Gia Scala, flanked by George Nader and Sydney Chaplin. There's a super, haunting score by Alex North -- Monday at 4:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics. Fans of the occult should pounce on Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), a strange, riveting mystery sleeper set in Kansas (of all places) with no stars and not much of a budget. A pretty young woman (Candace Hilligoss) drives off a bridge, into a river. Next, she's calmly walking toward a distant, large tent with lights and music. Your move -- Tuesday at 9 P.M. and 1 A.M. on SCI-FI. James Stewart's strong performance is the reward of Andrew V. McLaglen's SHENANDOAH (1965). He's a widowed southern pacifist caught up in the Civil War through his family. The persuasive cast includes Doug McClure, Rosemary Forsyth, Patrick Wayne and Katharine Ross -- Monday at 9 P.M. on the movie map with a small boat and a cast of exactly three: Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka (in photo) and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Hang on; Polanski makes very little go a long way -- Sunday at 9 P.M., Friday at midnight on CUNY. For amusing nostalgia, try a blissfully brisk and tacky old Fox musical spotlighting Alice Faye -- a spoof of radio glory titled SING, BABY, SING (1936) which she does, nicely. The songs are neat and her colleagues are game: Adolphe Menjou and Gregory Ratoff. And Patsy Kelly and Ritz Brothers never hurt any picture.

Allaying Wall Street's biggest fear, Microsoft reported that Windows 95 was selling very well indeed and that its earnings were up 58 percent. Intel, Sun Microsystem, Silicon Graphics and I.B.M. were also strong performers; Apple Computer was the major disappointment, down 47.6 percent. Pharmaceutical companies and brokerage houses also had strong quarters, and General Motors beat expectations. But Ford Motor took a stiff loss, its profits down 68 percent as costs rose and overseas sales slipped. The Dow, the S. & P. 500 and the Big Board composite rode the news to record highs. ALARM BELLS So Much for Oversight The Federal Reserve and Daiwa Bank's management won no applause for their review of trading problems at the bank's New York branch. A former Fed official disclosed that nearly two years before Daiwa disclosed its $1.1 billion loss from unauthorized trading, the president of the New York Fed had met with Daiwa to discuss the employee, Toshihide Iguchi, and his trading practices. Clearly the followup left a lot to be desired. As Mr. Noguchi pleaded guilty in Federal court to a variety of charges, both he and prosecutors said two senior executives at Daiwa conspired to conceal the loss. Daiwa said only that it was continuing its own investigation. SAFETY NET Dialing for Dollars Concerns about Japanese banking go far beyond Daiwa. The Federal Reserve put in place a system to provide Japanese financial authorities with billions of dollars in cash, almost instantly, in exchange for U.S. Treasury bonds and bills held by the Japanese. The goal is to avert a catastrophic bank collapse that would ripple around the globe. And because the Treasury would receive its own issues in exchange for the cash, the safety net appears to be risk free. TAXES Stumbling on the High Wire First President Clinton told a group of business executives that he had raised taxes ""too much"" in his first budget, providing comfort to Republican critics and infuriating Democrats who had stood by him at the time. A day later, he backtracked and said he was ""very, very proud of what I did.""",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

In my own efforts, I've worked from scholarly word-by-word translations and from the nearly verbatim fourth-century Latin Vulgate translation of St. Jerome. So my sense of the verbal, intellectual and sonic fidelity of Everett Fox's profoundly informed new version is hardly authoritative, but I can at least compare his work with the voluminous suggestions of my own early guides.

English translators of the Bible in our century have concentrated on two related and equally misguided goals: to make the ancient text more accessible to modern readers and to make its meanings perfectly transparent. In an effort to achieve the former aim, translators have repackaged the idioms and syntax of the Bible in a pedestrian English style that wanders uncertainly between the language of the daily newspaper and that of a bureaucratic manual. In pursuit of clarity, what is pungent and concrete in the Hebrew is made bland and abstract, and the mystery and purposeful ambiguity of the original evaporates in explanatory paraphrase masquerading as translation.",1995-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Presidents, kings and ministers from every continent gathered to salute the United Nations on its 50th birthday in an atmosphere of hope and heartbreak. A1 WELCOME TO NEW YORK As the anniversary sessions began, New York City's idiosyncracies bloomed larger than life, from its talent for pomp to its labyrinthine traffic detours. A1 Yasir Arafat at the United Nations for the first time in 21 years. A9 President Clinton ordered a freeze of Colombian drug assets. A11 LOW TURNOUT IN IVORY COAST Few turned out to vote in the first presidential election in the Ivory Coast since the death of the country's long-governing founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny. A5 HUNGARIAN REBELLION'S ROOTS Old tapes may shed light on whether the 1956 Hungarian uprising was spurred on by provocative broadcasts of Radio Free Europe, then financed by the C.I.A. A6 Berlin voters dealt a blow to Social Democrats. A6 Damascus Journal: 10,000 mobile ""mice"" rout buses. A4 National A12, A16, B8-10 MISSISSIPPI'S WELFARE BATTLE Liberals warn that a Republican plan to eliminate the Federal entitlement to welfare will encourage states to ""race to the bottom."" But Mississippi, where one of every three children lives in poverty, is already there. A1 THE ON-LINE POLITICAL DEBATE The Internet is a rip-roaring, if chaotic, new forum for political debate, with the 1996 election shaping up as a dress rehearsal for a serious on-line battle in 2000. A1 RUNOFF FOR LOUISIANA GOVERNOR Louisiana voters put a conservative white Republican and a liberal black Democrat in a runoff to become the state's next governor. Analysts said they expected state Sen. Mike Foster, the Republican, to easily defeat U.S. Representative Cleo Fields. A12 DEAL-MAKING IN LABOR ELECTION In the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidential election, the lead of the insurgent candidate, John Sweeney, showed signs of narrowing because of eleventh-hour deal-making by his opponent, Thomas Donahue. A12 POLITICS AND THE NAZI CARD With increasing frequency, candidates from both political parties have used comparisons to Nazis, Nazi behavior and the Holocaust to call attention to some imagined political act of horror. A12 WHO WILL SAVE THE CHILDREN? After weeks of attacking the Republican budget in the name of the elderly, the Democrats now will argue that the country's children will suffer from spending cuts. But Republicans say their plans will work long-term. A16 TOUGH FEEDBACK ON MEDICARE After passing a bill to curb Medicare spending, House members returned to their home districts to find constituents less accepting of a plan many elderly people fear will hurt their medical services. B8 GINGRICH'S 10 PERCENT FACTOR The House Speaker has said that ""ninety percent of me does not think I am going to run"" for President.

""We're on the right track,"" President Clinton declared, trying to take advantage of the sunny report for his budget negotiations with the Congress. [ Page 1. ] Stock prices rebounded after Thursday's selloff as money managers took heart that inflation appeared to be under control. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 37.93 points, to 4,741.75. Bank stocks and technology issues were strong. [ 37. ] Bond prices swung widely as traders first feared that the strong economy would keep the Fed from lowering interest rates further, then tempered their reaction, seeing hope for a budget accord. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.35. [ 36. ] Allied Signal to Cut 3,100 Jobs Allied Signal reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter net income but said profit in its automotive parts unit was off. The company said it would cut 3,100 jobs in that division, or about 3.7 percent of its total work force, and quit the car anti-lock brakes business. Allied's shares rose $2, to $43.375. [ 35. ] Aetna Earnings Jump 42% Aetna Life reported an unexpectedly large 42 percent gain in third-quarter earnings from operations, to $212.6 million, citing reduced costs for pollution cleanup. [ 35. ] Look Out Coke, Arizona Is Coming The small but feisty Arizona iced tea company is entering the cola wars. It is now making three flavored colas and a root beer. The line is being watched closely because of Arizona's record for smart product innovations. [ 35. ] Oil Partners Press Moscow Kazakhstan and its partner Chevron are trying to win Russia's agreement to ship more oil from their Tengiz fields. They are also planning to build a pipeline to connect to the Black Sea. If successful, Chevron could finally cash in on its $1 billion investment. [ 34. ] Airbags Tied to Childrens' Deaths Eight children may have been killed by airbags, according to a Government official, who said a redesign may be needed. [ 6. ] For TV Industry, a Cut-Rate Sale Buried in the budget bill is a plan to sell off a chunk of the nation's airwaves over the next seven years for an estimated $14 billion. It would give broadcasters licenses for ""advanced television service,"" such as high-definition or interactive television, that Government economists say could be worth $70 billion. [ 9. ] The Senate veered away from the House in approving several changes to the bill to balance the Federal budget by 2002. It killed a provision to let corporations withdraw billions of dollars in surplus assets from their pension funds, retained the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for a variety of poor people and kept regulations on nursing homes. [ 1. ] Tougher Limits on Lobbyists House Republicans plan a vote in November on tighter registration rules for lobbyists and on banning gifts to representatives and their staffs. The Senate adopted similar measures during the summer. [ 8. ] No Comment to the Japanese In an unusually tart exchange, the State Department told the Japanese Ambassador that it would not explain or confirm reports that the C.I.A. spied on Japanese negotiators during tense economic talks this year. [ 4. ] Japanese regulators accused Merrill Lynch Japan of violating a rule meant to prevent brokerage firms from manipulating stocks during new-securities sales. Some analysts saw the move as a retaliation for American criticism of the big loss at Daiwa Bank.

Hanging Gardens","This month, the Coast Guard said it will close its base on Governors Island, in New York Harbor, off the southern tip of Manhattan, and the Federal Government has given New York City and the state the first option on buying the land. The 175-acre island, which the Manahatas Indians sold to the Dutch for two ax heads, a string of beads and some nails, has been valued at $500 million. The Op-Ed page asked urban planners, historians and writers to suggest ways in which the city might develop it. Here are their responses. New Yorkers don't have enough shaggy places. Sure, we have weedy lots in all five boroughs but not wild parks like Rome's Campagna, the Buttes-Chaumont in Paris or London's Hampstead Heath. Why not make Governors Island into New York City's Ninfa? In Ninfa, a ruined Italian village transformed into a garden, every roofless building is walled with roses. Gut the Governors Island Burger King, bowling alley, movie theater, beauty salon and hospital. (Contemplation of ruins is the best and healthiest recreation.) Shag up the abandoned buildings with rambler roses, porcelainberry vine and sweet autumn clematis. Turn naked interiors into walled courtyards. To cover maintenance and security, copy Britain's Landmark Trust, which rents out gazebos, hermits' huts and other garden follies. Governors Island, likewise, could rent out its motel, clapboard cottages and fancy brick houses at rates to suit every pocketbook.

The protagonists include baffled children and men struggling to hold together uneasy marriages and uncertain careers, as well as two very different yet equally resilient women taking stock of their long lives. But while these 16 stories are in most ways insistently diverse, they do share one central feature: each turns on a sudden moment of self-revelation, inspired by accident, violence or loss. In ""A Boy and His Dog,"" which takes place during the Vietnam War, a marine given an impossible job betrays with fatal consequences the one figure he can depend on -- the dog he uses to clear booby traps from jungle trails. ""Defender of the Faith"" is a bittersweet sketch of what happens when a naive adolescent discovers the irrational sway of desire. In the title story, Mr. Flynn traces with subtlety and humor how a widow, thinking back over her stifling history while visiting her husband's grave, is stunned into a realization of the possibilities that are still open to her. It's an exhilarating moment, entirely convincing. And it perfectly demonstrates how these wise, artful stories catch the ways in which we accept or deny what we see when the unexpected casts a bright light on our lives. RICHARD E.

us,"Once Again, Huskymania","IT is an October afternoon and Jen Rizzotti is on the court at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs diving for a loose ball, shoving her way through traffic under the net and making a basket, then reaching in and grabbing a rebound. The new players on the UConn team, freshmen and transfers, stop momentarily as this whirling dervish called Rizzotti does her thing, then Rizzotti says, ""This is basketball, let's move!"" and everyone does. Jamelle Elliott, her co-captain, urges her teammates on, scolds them when they miss a shot but more often, like Rizzotti, shouts encouragement. ""That's it baby. Good, Kara,"" Elliott says to Kara Wolters when she makes a graceful hook shot. It's only a scrimmage among teammates; it is four days before real practice can begin -- and the women's basketball season officially opens -- but Rizzotti goes after the ball with her trademark abandon. And Elliott has her game face on, a scowl that could strike fear in the heart of any opposing player, a scowl that doesn't leave her face until the nearly two-and-a-half-hour scrimmage is over, until her T-shirt is soaking wet, until she's exhorted all the other players to do their best. Only then, when she and Rizzotti share a few light-hearted words, do the lips turn up in a smile, does Rizzotti actually sit down and rest. ""Nice work, J. J.,"" Rizzotti says to Elliott. Elliott nods her head. This is the follow-up to the 35-0, national championship dream season, the follow-up to the Hartford parade, the White House trip, the Letterman show, the season that brought Husky-mania to an all-time high, when fan mail arrived by the grocery cartful. But it is also the season without Rebecca Lobo, the National Player of the Year, the team leader who ""did the work of three people on the court,"" said Kelley Hunt, a 6-2, sophomore. Lobo is now on the United States Senior National Team, gearing up for the Olympics. She will play for that team in an exhibition game against UConn next Sunday. ",1995-10-29T05:00:00+0000

The new players on the UConn team, freshmen and transfers, stop momentarily as this whirling dervish called Rizzotti does her thing, then Rizzotti says, ""This is basketball, let's move!"" and everyone does. Jamelle Elliott, her co-captain, urges her teammates on, scolds them when they miss a shot but more often, like Rizzotti, shouts encouragement. ""That's it baby. Good, Kara,"" Elliott says to Kara Wolters when she makes a graceful hook shot. It's only a scrimmage among teammates; it is four days before real practice can begin -- and the women's basketball season officially opens -- but Rizzotti goes after the ball with her trademark abandon. And Elliott has her game face on, a scowl that could strike fear in the heart of any opposing player, a scowl that doesn't leave her face until the nearly two-and-a-half-hour scrimmage is over, until her T-shirt is soaking wet, until she's exhorted all the other players to do their best. Only then, when she and Rizzotti share a few light-hearted words, do the lips turn up in a smile, does Rizzotti actually sit down and rest. ""Nice work, J. J.,"" Rizzotti says to Elliott. Elliott nods her head. This is the follow-up to the 35-0, national championship dream season, the follow-up to the Hartford parade, the White House trip, the Letterman show, the season that brought Husky-mania to an all-time high, when fan mail arrived by the grocery cartful.

What startling beauty of phrase, twists of thought, depths of sorrow and bursts of wit! -- this was a rainbow prose that made most others look flat and gray. ""Lolita"" sensationally followed in 1958, and I settled into an enraptured readership as, capitalizing upon this breakthrough into best-sellerdom, the exquisite but industrious author mingled new productions in his adopted English with lovingly supervised translations from his large oeuvre in his native Russian. The publication now, 18 years after Nabokov's death, of his collected stories, under the editorship of his son and favorite translator, Dmitri Nabokov, offered a threat as well as a treat: a threat, that is, to dull and dampen a faithful reader's old ardor with a ponderous assembly of short fiction originally consumed in the four handy collections, of 13 items each, which the senior Nabokov had issued while alive.",1995-10-29T05:00:00+0000

Slowly but inexorably, the disease destroys William, attacking both his body and his identity, and at the end he dies.

He insisted that he was a middle-class guy, with middle-class values -- and a middle-class income. ""I'm not rich,"" he said again and again. So imagine my surprise when, a few days after interviewing Mr. Marcos on the campaign trail last winter (he was defeated in his Senate race in May), I found him relaxing on the powdery white beach of what is without doubt the most luxurious and expensive beach resort in the Philippines: Amanpulo. Mr. Marcos and his wife were living in sybaritic splendor in one of the $500-a-night beachside cottages, while his infant son and a nanny slept in another $500-a-night cottage. He recognized me. ""Pretty place,"" he said, without a trace of caught-in-the-act embarrassment. Yet while I might question Mr. Marcos's truthfulness about his bank balance, I do not question his taste in holidays. Amanpulo is one of those magic destinations in Southeast Asia that defy any common definition of luxury. It is a beach resort so comfortable, so beautiful, so secluded, so culturally and environmentally sensitive, and yet so understated and unstuffy, that you leave it with the fear that no place else will ever quite live up to its standards.",1995-10-29T05:00:00+0000

But for three days each summer, newfangled games are forgotten and all attention focuses on the town of Edirne, where rollicking spectators watch greasy wrestlers lathered with olive oil (the better for reaches to exceed grasps) compete at the Kirkpinar festival. Edirne's glory dates from the Ottoman Empire's first thrust into Europe. As legend has it, a commander, Suleyman Pasha, decamped in a field near the town, and his squad of 40 men began wrestling to pass the time. Whether the warriors used oil is unrecorded, but as they competed, two wrestlers collapsed and died.

A1 CAMPAIGNING FOR QUEBEC VOTES Volunteers from both camps are working hard in Quebec, if one town is an example, to claim the undecided votes, in the referendum over separation from Canada. A3 ELUSIVE BOSNIA ARMS PARITY The United States lacks a plan to give Bosnia military strength to match that of the Bosnian Serbs, which is seen as essential to withdrawing peacekeepers eventually. News analysis. A8 SIGNIFICANT CROATIA VOTE Legislative elections in Croatia are likely to reverberate in the Bosnian peace talks in Ohio because of a decision to let Bosnian Croats vote and what that might mean for Croatia's ambitions. A8 A suggestion that Serbs destroyed evidence in Bosnia killings. A8 WARNING FROM ISLAMIC GROUP After the killing of its leader in Malta, widely believed to be the work of Israeli intelligence agents, the Islamic Holy War movement said it would carry out new attacks against Israelis. A9 Leaders gathered to turn Arab-Israeli peace into business deals. A9 OPPOSITION SPOTLIGHT IN MEXICO A former mayor of Mexico City who has figured in the great dramas in the country recently has split from the governing party and has become an opposition leader. A7 A subway fire in Azerbaijan killed some 300 people. A8 Accusations are straining the United States' ties with Colombia. A5 South Africa will arrest former officials for 1987 killings. A6 San Carlos de Bariloche Journal: Nazi ties taint Argentine town. A4 National A10-15 BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN House and Senate Republican leaders said they would begin ironing out differences on the budget and promised to send a final bill to President Clinton in three weeks. A1 SURPRISINGLY HAPPY DAYS At a time when Democrats should be dispirited, some House and Senate members seemed optimistic as the first phase of the budget debate came to a close last week. A1 CONTROLLING TROUBLED PRISONS Corrections officials across the country said that controlling prisons was becoming more difficult because of spiraling inmate populations, longer sentences and widespread drug trafficking and addiction. A1 LUCRATIVE 'CHRISTIAN THRILLERS' A lucrative literary trend is developing with a genre loosely called ""Christian thrillers,"" in which potboiling adventure is combined with a conservative theology. A1 POLL: A LARGER G.O.P. TENT While political wisdom holds that Republican primaries are dominated by right wing voters, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll showed that these voters are a disparate group. A11 IN ATLANTA, SWEET JUSTICE Ever since Atlanta was burned, the city has been carrying a grudge. But with one swing of a bat by a right-fielder named Justice, the Braves finally knocked the chip off the city's shoulder. A10 HEARTLAND EMBRACES RUSSIANS Kansas residents have greeted the first Russian military exercise on United States soil with sophistication and no public protests. A10 25,000 TO PATROL DETROIT STREETS At least 25,000 residents responded to Detroit's call to rise up against the Halloween ritual known as ""Devil's Night"" and help the city catch arsonists who try to burn the city down each year.

us,Pequots' Foxwood Casino,"PLAYER: The Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe, Ledyard, Conn. PRODUCER: Robinson & Cole, Hartford, and Direct Response, Tolland, Conn. SCRIPT: Foxwoods -- the world's most successful casino. But that's only part of the story. The Mashantucket Pequots' Foxwoods Resort and Casino has become one of Connecticut's largest employers, providing jobs to over 10,000 people, strengthening thousands of additional jobs throughout Connecticut, while purchasing over $1 billion in construction, goods and services from large and small businesses and contributing over $300 million to the state. A success story born in the woods of Eastern Connecticut. Coming soon to the the city of Bridgeport: a new world-class casino, bringing over 9,000 new jobs to Connecticut. Mashantucket Pequots, committed to Connecticut's future and Connecticut's people. VISUAL: The commercial opens with an aerial view of Foxwoods, then cuts to 17 images of workers. After another scenic shot of Foxwoods, it cuts to a bleak shot of the Bridgeport skyline, followed by an artist's rendition of the proposed casino. It ends with a construction worker on a steel beam, accompanied by the tribe's logo. ACCURACY: The commercial accurately states the economic contributions Foxwoods has made. Its assumptions about the future in Bridgeport, however, are subject to debate. The ad says flatly that a casino will open soon, without acknowledging that the plan faces an uphill battle in the Legislature and that construction would take more than three years. Some legislators have questioned the claim that the casino will mean 9,000 jobs. SCORECARD: Facing intense opposition in the legislature, the tribe is trying to take the debate outside the Capitol and use Foxwoods's accomplishments to encourage support for the Bridgeport proposal. Such image-building advs are common at the start of electoral and legislative campaigns. But it may be too late to mobilize support to influence the Legislature.",1995-10-31T05:00:00+0000
