Four of the five band members were in the English group Heavenly, and Marine Research retains Heavenly's old combination of cleverness and modesty. In genially imperfect voices, Amelia Fletcher and Cathy Rogers sing about the yearnings of the unglamorous and about romances that aren't quite working out, as lovers strive for ''the pretense at calm with the chaos inside.'' Meanwhile the tunes lilt through blithe, unaggressive pop, from early Merseybeat to syncopated French ye-ye.

Born in New Haven on June 25, 1915, Mr. Jackson was the son of the late John Day Jackson and Rose Herrick Jackson, and was the sixth of a family of eight children. Mr. Jackson graduated from Kent School in 1933. One of his fondest memories of his years there was his membership on the rowing crew that brought the school its first ever to win in the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in England. For fifty years prior to his retirement in 1987 Mr. Jackson was the CEO and publisher of the Jackson Newspapers based in New Haven, Connecticut. Mr. Jackson's father, John Day Jackson, purchased The Register in 1895 launching a publishing operation that was to become the New Haven region's dominant newspaper concern. Those who worked for Mr. Jackson recall him as a considerate boss who cared deeply about the newspapers, his employees and his community. ''Lionel Jackson was a gentle and thoughtful man'', said Walter J. Nester, former Vice President and General Manager at The Register, who knew Mr. Jackson for more than 40 years. ''He was devoted to the newspapers and the community they served. He enjoyed the challenge of publishing good newspapers. I know I share with many current and former employees who knew Lionel a deep sense of loss.'' Mr. Jackson was active in a wide variety of businesses, civic and cultural organizations. A list of organizations in which he served as a Director or member at one time during his life would include: the former Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, The Connecticut Public Expenditure Council, The President's Advisory Council of Quinnepiac College, Yale-New Haven Hospital, The United Way of Greater New Haven, The Salvation Army, and the Connecticut Blue Cross. Mr. Jackson also served as a Director of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the Central Housing Committee and the Connecticut Action Committee. He was also a strong supporter of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, and was named as an honorary director of that organization. Mr. Jackson was an accomplished pianist who once soloed with the New Haven Businessman's Orchestra. An avid boater, Mr. Jackson often commuted alone between his summer home on outer Long Island and Connecticut. He captained his small diesel powered yacht along Intercoastal waterways between Long Island Sound and Florida on almost an annual basis. Mr. Jackson was a member of several yacht clubs, including the Devon Yacht Club of East Hampton, Long Island and one in Delray Beach, Florida. Mr. Jackson was also one of the strongest supporters of New Haven Boys Clubs, Inc. Private services will be held on Tuesday in Montecito, California.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Bad Trip,"Mistreated adolescents have often squirmed at the center of the cartoonist Lynda Barry's strange universe, but never so disturbingly as in CRUDDY: An Illustrated Novel (Simon & Schuster, $23). The book, named for the favorite adjective of the 16-year-old Roberta Rohbeson, tells two intertwined stories set five years apart. We first meet Roberta -- a girl who claims she is so ugly that boys bark at her and offer her dog biscuits awhen she is 11, and she begins to recount a home life so unrelentingly horrific as to seem a hallucination. But we really come to know her only through a diary in which the teen-age Roberta, suicidal and seeking acceptance from a whacked-out girlfriend and a wan hippie called the Turtle, details, with an eerie calm, a nightmarish (and involuntary) cross-country road trip with ''the father,'' a man who addresses her as ''Clyde.'' This man may or may not be her actual father; Roberta is never quite sure. He's an out-of-work meatcutter who carries the tools of his trade -- a terrifying set of butcher knives, each with its own name (''Little Debbie'') -- and who goes insane while on the search for the three suitcases of his swindled inheritance, leaving a litter of bodies in his wake. How Roberta reacts to these events -- and to the psychological battering that precedes them -- is the crux of this story, which is populated with a cast of depraved (and often very funny) secondary characters. ''Cruddy'' can be uncomfortable to read -- Barry spares no repulsive description of the dark doings here, and a rotting stench and the swarming of flies seem to follow everywhere. But the author's ability to capture the paralyzing bleakness of despair, and her uncanny ear for dialogue, make this first novel a work of terrible beauty. Alanna Nash",1999-09-05T05:00:00+0000

My wife, Mindy, also wanted some of her natal wild surf and, in an effort to recapture her childhood fantasy of owning a pony, riding. Unspoken was the desire for serious downtime. Anywhere else but Hawaii, the odds would have been against us. But here it was not only possible to find everything we wanted, and then some, but all within the confines of one resort -- although, at 54,000 acres, the word ''confines'' is not one I'd use in describing the Molokai Ranch. In our three-day visit to this environmentally friendly adventure travel resort, which opened three years ago, we not only rode horses and mountain bikes and body boards but also slept on a firm bed in a safari-style tent with a full moon overhead, axis deer nibbling shrubs outside, and giant surf crashing on the beach below.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Hot Wheels in Rockingham,"Craig McDean was born in Manchester, England, and grew up near an automobile race track. Living so close to such danger and excitement instilled in him a tremendous respect and admiration for race car drivers and their sleek, powerful machines. In I LOVE FAST CARS (Powerhouse Books, $40), McDean, now a fashion photographer in New York, goes back to the track and rekindles his youthful passion for speed with terrific results. Instead of focusing on the popular and glamorous worlds of NASCAR or Top Fuel drag-racing, McDean visits places like North Carolina's Rockingham Dragway, better known as the Rock, where he concentrates on the decidedly unsophisticated world of do-it-yourself drag-racing. His shots have a wonderful fly-on-the-wall quality, especially a picture of a group of shivering race fans passing around a bottle of Jack Daniel's, and a hysterical shot of a man crammed halfway down the rocketlike tail pipe of an enormous dragster. McDean treats man and machine with equal reverence. In his pictures, cars ooze raw power: a menacing shot shows a dragster peeling out so violently that all but its very tip is shrouded in an enormous billow of cottony white smoke. McDean shoots in both black and white and color, but it is in the latter that he achieves his best results -- some of the shades of orange, yellow and pink he captures have a brilliantly rich, cartoon quality that seems to soak the page.

She was born in Richmond, Virginia, to William and Florence Goggin. Resided in Beverly, Mass. graduating from Beverly High School in 1953. Graduate of Leslie College, Cambridge, Mass. in 1957. Taught in Newton, Mass. and Wallenford, Connecticut schools. Married Eugene G. McCarthy in June of 1958. Children, 3 boys, Joseph Gregory, 1959, John Ignatius, 1960 and Paul Eugene, 1963. Accompanied her husband who was Chief Health Advisor for the Alliance for Progress in Paraguay 1961-1964, appointed by President John F. Kennedy. Professionally she was an Innkeeper on the Maine seacoast-Smugglers Cove Motor Inn and the 1820 House Restaurant, Boothbay Harbor, in the late 60's and 70's. She established a nationwide Panel of Board Certified physicians for a national referral program for second opinions in the 70's and 80's. Her eldest son Joseph Gregory succumbed to schizophrenia in 1984 at the age of 25. The focus of her attention was the development of the gift of poetry - easy to read collections - exploring the basic human themes...solitude, love, pain, womanhood, aging and underlying it all, a call to faith. Her two books of poetry ''Catching the Spirit,'' 1994 and ''Prelude to Passion,'' 1999, address the fact that a lot of people are afraid of the intimacy with God. ''They are frightened.'' She felt that she had been given a gift to not only become aware of an intimacy but relish it. As a result of Joseph's death her activities were directed toward assisting the psychotic single homeless through the Franciscan Fathers in New York City, Visiting Professorships in Theology at Boston College, Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblicum University. Her spiritual life was continually nourished by her close association with the Trappist communities of St. Joseph in Spencer, Mass and St. Mary's in Wrentham. Likewise, she benefited from her nomination as a Dame of the Knights of Malta. She is survived by her husband Dr. Eugene G. McCarthy, Clinical Professor of Public Health, New York Weill Cornell Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Consultant to a number of Joint Trust Funds, John Ignatius McCarthy of Brunswick, Maine, two grandchildren, AnyaRose and Matthew Joseph, Paul Eugene McCarthy of Martinsberg, West Virginia, a sister, Sheila Goggin of Lowell, Mass.

In 1998, he co-founded the Connie Hogarth Center for Social Action, which is located at Manhattanville, and he was instrumental in the creation of a Latin American Studies minor at the College.

He held a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University, conducted research at El Colegio de Mexico, and held visiting associate professorships at North Carolina State University, Iona College and Purchase College (SUNY).

I bought it, went to lunch and started flipping through the pages, waiting for something to jump out at me. My eye fell on this passage: ''Some art has a very open meaning, and can be written about in terms of this meaning; but the chances are that if the meaning is the most interesting thing about it, it does not stand alone, it does not assert itself. It leans on what it means. An implied meaning is richer.''

Norman D. Vaughan says that besides his caribou parka, the most useful piece of clothing he wore on Byrd's 1928 expedition was long woolen underwear. ''When you perspire in wool, it gets wet!'' Vaughan says. ''We'd change our underwear every three weeks, all at once. It was like a Saturday night bath. We'd make five more miles on the sleds, and I'd like to tell you, it was because of the underwear.'' Prada's silk and cashmere long underwear (pictured, $670 for a crew-neck top, $710 for a polo neck, and $600 for the bottoms) can be found at Prada, 841 Madison Avenue. 5. No styling products were used on this shoot, at the request of the photographer, Richard Burbridge, who wanted his subjects to ''look like themselves.'' One product that explorers use is Dermatone, a frostbite/sunburn protector. 6. Fred McLaren was part of the first baseball game played at the North Pole. ''It was late August in 1960,'' he says. ''We took great care to make sure the pitcher's mound was on the Pole. If you hit a home run, you'd circumnavigate the globe; if you hit into right field, you'd hit into tomorrow, and if the right fielder caught the ball, he'd throw it back into yesterday. Sliding took on new meaning, and I'm still not sure what day the game ended.'' 7. Interest in adventure has inspired ideas for everything from books (like ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''Into Thin Air'') to cars. Detroit's contributions include the GMC Denali (the Indian name for Mount McKinley). 8. Marcelo Mendez has been on an expedition on Easter Island. ''The island hasn't been contaminated,'' he says. ''It's like a microcosm of Earth, and we can use what happened there to think about what the future holds.'' On an expedition, Mendez is most concerned with what goes on his feet. On Easter Island, he wore Teva-type sandals. ''I'm more of a practical guy than a fashion guy,'' he says. An alternative might be these sandals ($140).

Juliet, the novel's narrator, is a practical-minded veterinary student who moves in with a group of eccentric strangers: Petruchio, a secretive, deadpan pharmacologist; a sexy drama student named Billy; Chris, an aging hippie; and Kerry, who Juliet says is ''just the kind of girl that I most disliked -- a kind of hysterical wild child.'' A clever, unstable, promiscuous actress, Kerry is also a gifted liar. Despite herself, Juliet falls in love with Kerry, who starts making sordid, questionable confessions: that she was until recently a professional dominatrix; that she's avoiding her new high-profile agents, a handsome married couple, because they want her to act in a porn film. Juliet ignores Kerry's tales, until one morning she stumbles across a woman's corpse in their front closet; before Juliet can get help, the body disappears. Then Kerry's agents go missing -- and Juliet suspects that Kerry is somehow involved. What evolves is less a traditional mystery than an engrossing mind game between Juliet and Kerry, who are polar-opposite personalities: as Kerry's compulsive lying couples with Juliet's sexual jealousy and increasingly wild paranoia, the truth in ''SchrRated PG-13dinger's Baby'' proves a very tricky thing to predict indeed.

us,Wild Boys,"1. During the Great Depression, there were 250,000 teen-agers riding the rails in America. In 1933, Warner Brothers -- as part of its series of ''social conscience'' films of that period -- released ''Wild Boys of the Road,'' the action director William Wellman's vivid depiction of young itinerant men who hopped freight trains in search of work. 2. ''Riding the Rails,'' a 1997 documentary, put a new spin on the romantic vision of that time. By interviewing survivors, the filmmakers Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell retold the old hobos' stories. The film won several awards, including a Best Documentary Director prize from the Directors Guild of America. 3. These photographs were taken at the Black River & Western Railroad, a tourist and freight train operation running between Flemington, Ringoes and Lambertville, N.J. (908-782-6622). The attractions here include 10 diesel engines and some boxcars on an R.I.P. track. Depending on the day, explains a volunteer, R.I.P. means either ''repair in progress'' or ''rust in place.'' 4.

Ken Leach, an owner of Gallery 47, a vintage perfume bottle store at 1050 Second Avenue (55th Street), said that even men are becoming avid collectors. ''Now guys are buying them and putting them in their offices,'' he said. Last week, Coty, the cosmetics giant, unveiled its collection, dating from 1904. On view at www.coty.com on the Web or by appointment at the corporate headquarters, 1325 Avenue of the Americas (53d Street), are designs by Baccarat and Rene Lalique, as well as kitsch classics like Jovan's Man and Woman interlocking bottles from the 1970's.

In the 1960's, James Bond made pubescent boys and girls want to mature and play with the adults. How better to express a middle-aged American's failure to find excitement as a grown up than by having him yearn for nonstop Bond on cable television?",1999-09-12T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Faces of the Nation,"The nearly 200 images in AMERICAN CHARACTERS: Selections From the National Portrait Gallery, Accompanied by Literary Portraits (Yale University, $45) represent the scope of American portrait painting and popular illustration, including photographs and daguerreotypes, posters, sheet music, silhouettes, caricatures and sculpture. These, in the words of the editors, R. W. B. Lewis and Nancy Lewis, are men and women who have '' 'made a difference' in our history'' -- a wide blanket for a book that opens with Pocahontas and Cotton Mather and ends with Tallulah Bankhead and Walt Disney. Facing each portrait is a page of commentary, with a capsule biography by the Lewises. Some prose portraits were written for this book -- Edward Hoagland on John Muir, John Updike on Ernest Hemingway, Robert B. Parker on Dashiell Hammett, among others. But it is the range of comments that gives this book its particular flavor -- most historical, some hostile, all enhancing the impression made by the portrait itself. John Adams's snide appraisal of Benjamin Franklin is followed by Franklin's physician's description of Franklin's ''art of living'' in Paris. Franklin, in a striking 1785 portrait by Joseph Siffrede Duplessis, stares from the opposite page unsmiling, unabashed. A heavy-browed portrait of Nathaniel Hawthorne more than matches the words of Henry James Sr.: ''He had the look all the time, to one who didn't know him, of a rogue who suddenly finds himself in a company of detectives.'' The portrait selections are witty and full of surprises: a childhood painting of Edith Wharton, a photograph of Mathew Brady looking away from the camera, self-portraits in oil by George Gershwin and E. E. Cummings, a terrific photo of a smiling John F. Kennedy walking toward a wall of outreaching hands. This is a book you can get lost in for hours. Even the notes on the portraits and the commentary make fascinating reading. David Walton",1999-09-12T05:00:00+0000

For 66 years, Ms. Karagheusian was President of the foundation founded by her parents, Mihran and Zabelle Karagheusian, in 1921, in memory of their son, Howard, who was stricken by influenza during the worldwide epidemic of 1918. Her father was a successful manufacturer of carpets under the name of Gulistan. In 1922, Ms. Karagheusian was graduated from Barnard College, and subsequently pursued social work at the Columbia University School of Social Work. Many charitable organizations in New York City were on her list for contributions, she was most active in this regard and established an endowment at Columbia University School of Social Work. Upon her being elected president of the foundation in 1933, she continued what her father had started in 1921, that is, Mr. Karagheusian established an orphanage in Constantinople for Armenian orphan children: Leila began to emphasize more intensive attention to health, medical and social programs for Armenian refugee children and their families residing in Greece, Lebanon and Syriavictims of the Turkish massacres that took place during the First World War. Pediatric clinics, social centers and school health programs were established in those countries. This was all done without regard to the race, religion or ethnic group of any needy children, and that credo exists to the present day. Low income housing was initiated in Greece, Lebanon and Syria in order to uplift the families of refugee Armenians. The Foundation, was the first to provide vaccinations to children and be concerned with their nutrition. In 1988, Ms. Karagheusian made a substantial donation for Armenian relief immediately after the devastating earthquake. In 1992, she approved establishing dental clinics for children in Armenia. Up to that time, preventive dentistry did not exist in the countries of the former Soviet Union. But she insisted that all dental supplies, equipment and technology be American. Tens of thousands of children, over the years, have been treated, clothed, fed and housed. She was a very modest person, shunning all publicity, and was intolerant of those who did a lot of talking but did nothing. Her motto was ''Get it done.'' She was a lifelong member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union, and was a member of the Jinishian Memorial Program. She never married.",1999-09-13T05:00:00+0000

The members, counsel, associates and staff of Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green, P.C. note with profound sadness the death of our long-time member and friend, Heidi B. Duerbeck, who passed away on September 15, 1999. Heidi was born on July 19, 1947 in Duisberg, Germamy. She attended the University of Goettingen in Germany in 1967-68 and graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, Cum Laude, and in 1969 with a Master of Arts degree before earning her Juris Doctor degree in 1972 from Stanford University. At Stanford Law School she was the Articles Editor of the Stanford Journal of International Studies and the 1972 recipient of the Carl Mason Franklin Prize in International Law. In the late 1980s Heidi served on the Board of Visitors of Stanford Law School and was President of the Stanford Law Alumni Association. After practicing law with the firm of Sullivan & Cromwell for several years, Heidi joined our firm in 1977 and became a member in 1979, the first woman partner of the firm. Heidi will be remembered as a skilled and sophisticated corporate lawyer specializing in German American legal transactions. She represented a large number of prominent German industrial companies in their acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and product distribution matters. Heidi's clients included many well-known names in the computer software, chemical, fashion and hotel industries. In addition to her law practice, Heidi was President of the German American LAw Association since 1982 and the first head of the Internation Section of Commercial Law Affiliates, one of the largest worldwide affiliations of independent law firms in the United States and around the world. Heidi also was a legal adviser to the New York State Department of Economic Development and to the New York City Chamber of Commerce with respect to the promotion of economic develpment through foreign investment in the State and City of New York and a lecturer on the legal aspects of foreign investment for the National Association of State Development Agencies.

us,The Great Mall,"Whatever harsh judgments history may render on Mao Zedong, he transformed China into a modern industrial nation, and at an amazingly rapid rate. Production, consumption, literacy, health care and much else multiplied exponentially within only a few years of the Communist takeover, in 1949. Even so, other aspects of Maoism proved disastrous. His neglect of agriculture in favor of industrialism led to widespread famine and the death of millions. Millions more perished in the 60's during the Cultural Revolution, which burned a wide swath through Chinese culture. And while Mao effectively abolished capitalism, he never correspondingly established anything that could be called Socialism either. China under his regime was a pure example of rule by the state, in which there was no private ownership of the means of production, and no bargaining power for workers. It took Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, to fully transform China's economy. Though Deng will most likely be remembered for having sent in troops to mow down the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989, he did much to encourage the pragmatic private market system that has rapidly changed the face of China. That new reality radiates from the two suns shown rising in this lacquer-on-wood panel creation by the three Luo Brothers of Beijing -- Wei Dong, Wei Guo and Wei Bing -- who are best known for blending images from Western culture and Chinese New Year calendars into their art. The larger sun rises over the young people who make up the country's consumer society. Western skylines, soft drinks and boomboxes meld with traditional dress of past centuries and inspirational Socialist realism of past decades. The smaller sun that casts a hopeful new light on Tiananmen Square is technological, appearing on 55 television monitors.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Drug Wars,"Tea could be called the original gateway drug. Approximately 30 million pounds were consumed annually in the British Isles in the early 1800's. All of it came from China, shipped to England by the British East India Company. When inflation overwhelmed Europe in the 1820's, the firm was unable to raise the hard currency demanded by Chinese tea merchants. Faced with ruin, it hit upon a devious but lucrative solution. In India, the company controlled the cultivation of opium, a drug banned in China since 1729. Parties officially unaffiliated with the company simply took opium shipments to Canton and secretly traded them for silver coin. The money was sent to London, laundered and returned to China, where it was used to buy tea. Quickly, the volume of opium coming into China increased a thousandfold. When China tried to stop the traffic, Britain blockaded Canton. The conflict escalated into war, with other Western powers, eager to colonize China, joining in.The Opium Wars began in 1839, continued on and off for more than 20 years and resulted in the fall of China's empire. The wars also sparked the drug epidemic that plagues us today. It is the modern consequence of a long-ago act that the fashion photographer David LaChapelle highlights in this photomontage. Models lie dazed in an opium den transformed into a steam room. They are in thrall to a giant syringe, which reminds us that profits grew even larger when the lowest grade of opium was converted into heroin. Of course, tea, which nominally started it all, is only mildly addictive. But then, perhaps, no substance is as addictive as money.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Accidents Will Happen, Repeatedly","Echoes of Muriel Spark (''The Driver's Seat'') and John Fowles (''The Collector'') sound throughout COLLECTORS (Random House, $19.95), Paul Griner's nevertheless distinctive literary thriller. Its protagonist is Jean Duprez, an art director for an advertising agency in Boston and a collector who cruises flea markets seeking (her specialty) antique fountain pens. When she attends the wedding of her cousin Claudia, and meets an attractive widower named Steven Cain, Jean's carefully managed life starts to unravel. After a satisfying day aboard Steven's sailboat, he accidentally slams her hand in a car door, then sends Jean, alone, to the hospital. Somehow, Claudia's disclosure that Steven ''has a lot of accidents'' only deepens Jean's fixation on her charismatic new lover. He is also a collector (binoculars), and it turns out that his former wife died in an accident Steven refuses to discuss. ''Collectors'' builds tension swiftly and skillfully, layering in ominous foreshadowings (a wrong-number phone call by someone seeking a funeral parlor, a smell of burning coal detected while at sea) as it teases us with conflicting explanations of its central mystery. Is Steven Cain a suave psychopath? Is Jean compulsively drawn to the danger he poses? Or is he the avenger calling her to account for the sins of her youth, the most flagrant being a house fire accidentally set during one of her childhood ''games'' with Claudia? Paul Griner, who is also the author of a short story collection titled ''Follow Me,'' juggles such alternatives ably, in a first novel whose deftly sketched characters and frissons of surprise and menace elevate it beyond simple imitation.

us,Engine of Change,"The Industrial Revolution was no sudden eruption. It occurred in fits and starts over more than half a century, starting in the 1700's. It was a revolution nevertheless, overturning many rooted assumptions. One was about work: before the Industrial Revolution, the word ''industry'' referred exclusively to an attribute of character. Another was about man's place in nature. Gregory Crewdson's photograph pays homage to O. Winston Link's railway photography. But while Link's pictures of trains celebrate the power of technology, Crewdson presents a darker outlook. Here, the animals have erected a blockade to stop the train. They are wise to be fearful, for the railroad did far more than speed up travel and commerce. Previous means of transport had followed nature's rules: the boat navigated currents, the carriage adapted its journey to the landscape and to the strength of its four-legged engines. The railroad, however, required a level surface. For it to work, nature had to be reconfigured. So hills were shaved, gaps filled in, tunnels blasted. The contract between humans and nature was suddenly voided. There was a paradox, though. As humans were besting their environment, they were also subjecting themselves to the rule of machines. Cotton gins and steam engines only briefly lightened laborers' tasks before creating new burdens, among them widespread pollution. The Industrial Revolution itself is now being superseded by the information revolution, which will inevitably create its own burdens. There is, however, no turning back.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Many Faces of Islam,"Based on the form of a Persian miniature, this work by Shahzia Sikander, a Pakistani artist who now lives in the United States, shows some of the paradoxes that attend Islam today. As Sikander and her collaborator, Sameer Butt, observe, despite political and cultural differences, Islam is one faith the world over. Islam, the law that the prophet Mohammed revealed in the seventh century, governs all aspects of life and, unlike Christianity, does not admit any dichotomy between church and state, between sacred and secular. Islam overrides nationality; Western notions of political left and right do not apply. Difficulties, of course, arise from interpretation and behavior. The Judeo-Christian world today has only a partial and deeply distorted view of Islam. For one thing, we tend to forget the vast contributions made by Islam in the Middle Ages -- the philosophical writings of Averros and Avicenna, advances in astronomy and mathematics, the preservation of ancient Greek manuscripts.For another, we overlook the religion's contemporary strains of thought and practice, a point Sikander makes by constructing a galaxy of Islamic leaders. Packed into her picture are mystics like the Pakistani qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, politicians like Hanan Ashrawi, the Christian Palestinian activist, and religious leaders like Ayatollah Khomeini. The artist included Menachem Begin to signify what she regards as Israel's role in uniting Muslims against a common foe. (See identifying diagram, page 146.) Non-Muslims often think that a jihad is meant to be carried out by force of arms, but many of the faithful believe, rather, that it consists of following the path of righteousness and setting a good example. Indeed, it is this side of Islam, not the extremism so prominent in recent years, that Sikander's visualization suggests will prevail.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The workday was determined by light; in Paris, tanners worked until two coins of similar appearance but different denomination could no longer be told apart. All measurements were vague and subjective then - an inch was the width of my thumb, which was not the same as yours - but time was the most indeterminate category of all. The calendar was equally fluid. For a long time Venice and Florence did not observe the same year. Even literate nobles dated their letters by the year of the king's reign. Few people had more than a rough idea of their own age. The mechanical clock, a complex contrivance of toothed wheels and weights, began what was to be a long and laborious process of standardization as the world slowly agreed to hold certain conventions in common, like time zones. (Less than a century ago, noon in New York fell a bit after noon in Hartford and a bit before noon in Newark.) In this clocklike sculpture built by Arthur Ganson, an engineer, inventor and artist in residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, time runs on an electric motor. But it is the gears, pulleys and springs that direct the nervous dance of the figures on top. As we learned to master time, the sculpture reminds us, we also fell under its yoke.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The other is the wars for colonial independence that dominated Latin America later in the 19th century and continued on in Asia and Africa in the 20th. In this painting, the noted Haitian artist Ernst Prophte reimagines the proclamation of Haitian independence on Jan. 1, 1804, in the town square at Gonaives, by Gen. Jean-Jacques Dessalines. American schoolchildren remember Haiti's liberator as Toussaint L'Ouverture, but that extraordinary man, who led a population of ex-slaves to victory over French, Spanish and British armies, had by then died of pneumonia in a French prison. Since the revolution, Haiti's example has been alternately inspiring and dispiriting. The success of its popular uprising against overwhelming odds demonstrated to the world the mettle and power of a race barely accorded human status at the time. That Haiti was just the second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere deepened the triumph. Haiti's achievements, however, were overshadowed by formidable difficulties. The country was instantly plagued by economic problems. Warfare, for example, had ruined the irrigation system that made the island France's richest agricultural outpost. Furthermore, while its new leaders subscribed to the revolutionary ideal of liberte, they dispensed with fraternite and egalite. Democracy was not part of the program. Dessalines soon named himself Emperor; two years later he was killed by his own generals. Subsequent regimes did not fare much better. In recent years, Haiti has sought to renew its democratic promise. Whether it will remains an open question -- a fact underscored by this painting, which reminds the viewer that Haiti's most hopeful moments have only been preludes to disappointment.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Look of Fear,"Many authoritarian movements have darkened the 20th century, and the word ''Fascism'' has been hurled at most of them. But Fascism is a specific phenomenon. It is a form of totalitarianism that is antiliberal and anticonservative as well as anti-Communist -- a form of populist ultranationalism of a racist and militaristic character. It is not, strictly speaking, reactionary. It pursues modernization by summoning up mythic images of a grand and heroic past. The ultimate aim is a hyperefficient state machine, with citizens as its cogs, held in place by private fear, collective rage and tribal enthusiasm. Benito Mussolini, probably the first effective popularizer of Fascism in this century, began as a socialist, but his brand of socialism brimmed with violence and vanguard action. Even he could pass for a moderate, though, in comparison with Adolf Hitler, whose national socialism surpassed every other version of the Fascist ideology in mechanization, cruelty and mad horror. There have been other forms of Fascism and other campaigns of extermination and racist hysteria -- millions were killed and terrorized in Stalin's murderous Soviet Union, for example. But the savagery of the Nazis leaves the bloodiest stain of the century. Aware of Fascism's greatest weapon, its atavistic lure, the photographer Gerald Slota consciously avoided creating a picture ''that could be interpreted as heroic.'' Instead, he blurred specific images to make them universal, and then centered attention on the silent, fearful vigilance of the victims' eyes.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Hello, Columbus","When Christopher Columbus made landfall in the Bahamas on Oct. 12, 1492, he set in motion a vast ecological transformation. The tide that conveyed Europeans to the New World also brought their cattle, horses, cats and pigs; their wheat, oats, grasses and nettles; their rats, insects and bacilli. Because the Americas had stood in splendid isolation for millenniums, the continent's diverse life forms were no match for the invasion-hardened genes of the Old World. While Europeans lacked the knowledge to carry out biological warfare intentionally, Cortes's conquest of Mexico and Pizarro's conquest of the Inca empire were made easier by smallpox, which preceded their armies and decimated the native populations. Meanwhile clover and thistles, peach trees and dandelions, opportunistic species all, conquered the fields and forests of the untrammeled continent. Christianity, firearms, the Roman alphabet, European styles of clothing, housing and protocol were imposed with minimal difficulty on the dazed and weakened natives. And what did the Old World receive in return? As punishment, only syphilis; very few American weeds were sufficiently aggressive to win retribution on foreign soil. The rewards that traveled east, however, were great: vanilla, maize, tobacco, potatoes, sunflowers, peanuts, tomatoes, indigo, chocolate. European diet and life style were altered profoundly; what started out as novelty quickly became immemorial tradition. These works by Catherine Chalmers depict one of the shock troops of the European invasion, the cockroach, fastening upon the bounty of the New World, represented by the tomato. The insect shown in these photographs, painted with an image that festooned Columbus's sails, did so well in its new home that it is now called the American cockroach.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; 'Calculated Nonchalance',"Like the wealthy subjects of his famous portraits, Anthony Van Dyck (1599-1641) was no stranger to good fortune. Almost everywhere he went, success followed. In Genoa he became the darling of a thriving merchant class who sought not only his skills as a portraitist but his amusing company and refined ways. In England, he lived in royal luxury as court painter to Charles I. Even in his native Antwerp, Van Dyck made a small fortune supplying grand altarpieces to a clergy in the throes of a redecorating frenzy brought on by the Counter-Reformation. For most of his life Van Dyck lived, as one early biographer put it, ''more like a prince than a painter.'' Success impaired neither Van Dyck's prodigious output nor his flair with a paintbrush. VAN DYCK: 1599-1641 (Rizzoli, $75), with essays and analysis by nine art scholars, contains more than 100 reproductions of the artist's paintings, including religious masterpieces like ''The Lamentation Over the Dead Christ,'' as well as the remarkably sensitive portraits of Europe's elite, on whom Van Dyck bestowed what Hans Vlieghe, an art historian and expert on Flemish art, calls a ''calculated nonchalance.'' One chapter, which is devoted to the milieu of 17th-century Genoa, scarcely mentions Van Dyck, but gives one a welcome understanding of how an artist of his talents could take an entire city by storm. An introduction by Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, gives a succinct account of Van Dyck's life: his childhood genius, his apprenticeship to Rubens, his obsession with Titian, which led Van Dyck to Italy and to the refinement of his lush, highly Baroque style. And then it's on to England and the court of Charles I, where in one seven-and-a-half year period Van Dyck produced some 400 portraits; when we envision the age of Charles I, it is most likely through Van Dyck's eyes that we see it.

us,New Found Land,"This tranquil scene at the water's edge is probably what Norse seamen saw around the year 1000, after sailing west from Greenland. Vinland, they called it; Newfoundland, we call it today -- a haven where the Vikings lived for a while until chased away by harsh winters and unfriendly natives. Where, exactly, did they come ashore? Geoffrey James's photograph shows Epaves Bay at L'Anse aux Meadows, in northernmost Newfoundland, where in 1961 the remains of six sod houses were found, the first hard evidence of a Norse presence. The site, James notes, ''is remarkable for its lack of drama,'' which is precisely what the Norsemen would have been looking for: an easy place to land, with room to graze their cattle. As demonstrated by the telltale rivets, nails, bits of iron and soapstone and a bronze pin found there, L'Anse aux Meadows was indisputably a Norse settlement. But it was probably not the only one in North America. The sagas describe Vinland as a place of great forests, where wild grapevines had to be cut down before ax men could get at the trees, and where salmon also thrived. Salmon and grapes coexist only in a narrow geographic corridor along the Atlantic coast between the Hudson River and northern Maine. Recent scholarship suggests that Vinland may have been off Passamaquoddy Bay, between Maine and New Brunswick.

us,Proof Positive,"Abelardo Morell's photograph shows a camera obscura, a simple lens-and-box device, reflecting upside down the image of the Englishman William Henry Fox Talbot, who might be considered the inventor of photography. Talbot successfully exposed his first negative in 1835, although he then waited four years before announcing the fact, thus allowing himself to be upstaged by Louis Daguerre of France. Talbot is, however, credited as the inventor of the fundamental negative-positive process, which permitted multiple prints to be made of a single exposure, as well as of calotype, the first method for producing images on sensitized paper. He therefore has a greater claim to the title of father of all subsequent photography than Daguerre. Though the Frenchman's method was refined more quickly, it was more cumbersome (it required a silver plate) and fell into disuse long before the end of the century. Talbot was a polymath who patented a linear motor and translated Assyrian cuneiform. He was also an artist of considerable stature. The image of leaves here comes from his 1844 book, ''The Pencil of Nature.'' It is ostensibly a showcase demonstrating the many uses of photography, from copying manuscripts to documenting architecture. Beyondthat, the book remains valuable for its quiet, carefully composed scenes of English country life. In its best-known image, ''The Open Door,'' a broom leans against the frame of a darkened cottage doorway. The picture has an austere but inviting beauty. It is both a record of a time and place -- and an appropriate metaphor for photography's ability to sweep the cobwebs away from vision.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

Here, an affable Bill Gates appears as a Renaissance grandee and Michael Eisner of Disney stands genially beside a cartoon creature in an illuminated page from ''Les Trs Riches Heures du Duc de Berry'' (1413-16), by the Limbourg brothers. At one level, the towers of Disneyland evoke those of the Duke's castle; in 1994, Gates made the celebrated acquisition of Leonardo da Vinci's ''Leicester Codex'' (1506-10). At a deeper level, the Renaissance was a time, like ours, of capital building and trade expansion. Europe's kings and nobles, for all their outward show of wealth and power, were often hugely in debt to merchant bankers like the Medici family of Florence and Jacob Fugger of Bavaria. Culture rode the coattails of money: vain patrons commissioned monuments that have endured, in some cases much longer than any memory of the patrons themselves. Paintings dazzled the eye not only with their genius but also with the richness of their settings and the rare ultramarine and gold of their pigments. The fortunes made in the spice trade allowed for cultural exchanges between East and West, opening doors -- in the Ottoman Empire, for example -- that the Inquisition tried unsuccessfully to slam shut. The materialism of the Renaissance justified itself by the splendor of the artwork and by the vigor, depth and solidity of the humanist ideas it permitted to flourish.

us,We've All Got Mail,"Our descendants will inevitably find their own name for what we now call, somewhat misleadingly, the Information Age. For the focus today is less on information itself than on the rapid profusion of devices for exchanging, storing and manipulating it. Multiple strands of technological development, some many decades old, have been coming together in ever more advanced incarnations, with complex results. The computer has a dense genealogy, going back to Joseph Marie Jacquard's punch-card loom (1804), Charles Babbage's Difference Engine (1833) and Herman Hollerith's census-data calculator (1890), before achieving a preliminary synthesis in the work of Alan Turing and John Von Neumann during World War II. Similarly, vacuum tubes gave way to transistors, which led to integrated circuits and, finally, to microchips. Satellites now draw on older technologies like television and the telephone to form another weave of relays and terminals for communication. These technologies affect almost every aspect of life, in ways that still appear radical, perhaps exhilarating, perhaps threatening. Nam June Paik, the electronic-multimedia artist, here suggests a cave painting for the present era: Samuel Morse's dots and dashes change into binary zeros and ones, satellites hover overhead and, down below, humanity remains, blissed out and plugged in.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Out of Africa,"The first African slaves arrived in the Americas, in Hispaniola to be exact, in 1502. In 1619, ''20 and odd'' black people disembarked in the Jamestown colony in Virginia, the first slaves in the future United States. Over the next 250 years, about 14 million Africans survived the ''middle passage'' and were consigned to forced labor in the fields of North and South America. They came largely from tribes on the west coast of Africa: the Ibo, Mandingo, Yoruba, Fulani, Wolof, Ashanti, Whydah and Coromantee. Somehow, despite overwork and disease, beatings and murder and the enforced breakup of families, their cultures managed to survive. This survival was patchwork, granted, but profound. Some of its manifestations were local: the Gullah language, the raked dirt yard, the cultivation of the yam. Some -- in dialect, in the style and employment of clothing and in religious practice -- had a national or hemispheric range. In music, the influence was global. We can hear it in blues, jazz, gospel, samba, rumba, merengue, reggae and zouk, of course, but also in styles of syncopation, instrumentation and vocalization that have infiltrated other musics high and low, east and west. If the African influence were somehow removed, what we think of as American culture would be unrecognizable. Kara Walker, who practices the art of cutting silhouettes out of paper (a technique that reached its peak in the early 19th century), has here made a complex tableau, which pointedly mimics the usual perception of the African diaspora. Though the viewer's focus is initially drawn to the reverse-cut white male at center, it quickly becomes clear that blacks are at the four corners of the world and that, as Walker puts it, the character in white is simply ''being reshaped by an African hand.''",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

We don't know whether such daubings were common and intended for viewing by all, a census of beasts or a record of hunts, or ceremonially esoteric and restricted to the purposes of a particular caste. Their mystery prefigures the tension between documentation and transcendence that marks art of more recent centuries.

us,"Big Brother's Eye, Mother Russia's Tears","This piece by Rimma Gerlovina and Valeriy Gerlovin, conceptual artists who left Russia in 1980 and are now American citizens, is an allegorical description of the Soviet Union. The hands are painted with the laurel crown that the Soviet empire awarded itself in grandiose emulation of its Roman antecedent. The three figures on the woman's face signify the three judges of the tribunals that consigned millions to the gulag or the grave: the central figure represents the all-seeing eye of the state; the two that flank it depict tears running down the face of Mother Russia. The history of the Soviet Union is a chronicle of disastrous failure on a monumental scale. Lenin's ambition in 1917 of turning feudal Russia into a modern industrial state, while establishing Socialism and simultaneously collectivizing agriculture, was the very definition of hubris. With the war against Hitler and several hard winters thrown in, it was a wonder, in retrospect, that the nation's collapse was not total and immediate. Nineteenth-century thinkers had imagined the triumph of Socialism as an apotheosis of human possibilities; the Soviet state saw things quite differently, for it tried, in effect, to reduce people to machine parts. Stalin, cruder than the wily Lenin, sought to rid his world of all the parts that didn't fit, at the cost of countless lives. Right up to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the state was still trying to watch, control and shape individuals, as if subjugation and fear could bring about the same results as consent. Communism's legacy is a modern Russia afflicted by a volatile, despairing mix -- a country whose structure is in ruins and where chaos is in the wind.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Great Leap Forward,"At the dawn of this millennium, China was centuries ahead of the West in science and technology. The Chinese, after all, had already invented paper, printing, gunpowder, the magnetic compass, the wheelbarrow, the kite, the crossbow and the sternpost rudder. But because of China's geographic and cultural isolation, it was centuries before its intellectual and technological bounty reached Europe. It took 600 years for the clockwork escapement, for example, to reach the West; the iron chain suspension bridge and the rotary fan took more than 1,000 years to make the trip. Doug and Mike Starn's scroll-like installation, which is meant to be read from right to left, represents the transmission of knowledge from scroll to book, from East to West. The scroll is laid out on two translucent tables, one of Chinese design, the other European in style. The work begins with Chinese drawings and calligraphy from the seventh century, accompanied by a portrait of Taizong, a renowned emperor of the period. These images then blend into a painting of a tree branch from 1360, titled ''A Breath of Spring,'' which stretches up and into a Western book. This volume, in turn, is composed of detailed medieval illustrations of fabled Western travelers who ventured to the East: Marco Polo, William of Rubruck and Giovanni Carpini. These 13th-century pioneers, who made their journeys during the reigns of the Great Khan Mangu and Kublai Khan, opened Europe's eyes to Asia. On first glance, what the West saw were silks and spices. It took longer for China's deeper store of wisdom to unfold and be revealed. Doug and Mike Starn's installation is about 17 feet long, 14 inches tall at the short end and 3 feet high at the book end. The Western-style manuscript table is acrylic, as are the two tables of Chinese design that the scrolls rest on. The luminosity of the piece, a trademark of the Starns' work, is the result of more than a dozen lamps placed beneath the scroll. An electronic scanner was used to transfer the images to the scroll, which is made of Mylar. It took four months to complete the piece.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Plague Years,"Epidemics have been a part of the human story since settled populations first attracted parasites and then trade conveyed them to other vulnerable places. The plague that fell on Europe in the 14th century was distinguished by its ferocity and its longevity. From its origins in central Asia, it was carried by rats aboard ships, reaching Italy in the fall of 1347 and quickly spreading as far as Britain and Scandinavia. The Black Death killed about a quarter of Europe's population and recurred periodically over the next three centuries. (The 17th-century plague that Daniel Defoe chronicled was essentially the same beast.) The concept of germs was unknown then, and the virulence of the contagion was beyond all experience. To speak with an infected person, to attend the sick, to bury the dead virtually guaranteed death. Whole cities were emptied; houses stocked with riches stood undisturbed; crops rotted in the fields. The plague's contemporary parallel is AIDS, which came out of nowhere, apparently, around 1979 and decimated a generation. Gay men, hemophiliacs, needle users and people living near the major trucking routes in Africa were among the most affected; to date, 14 million people have perished from the disease worldwide. AIDS is a deadly mystery, and its threat has provoked panic, blame and superstition. Joel-Peter Witkin's illustration, which juxtaposes the bones of a 14th-century plague victim with a living sufferer from AIDS, is a reminder that the threat remains. As sophisticated as our medical science may be, a cure continues to be out of reach. Even more dispiriting, perhaps, is this: another plague doubtless lies in wait, though no one knows where it will come from or when.",1999-09-19T05:00:00+0000

He returned to Aix and from there visited Les Baux, St. Remy and Avignon. He took a trip through the Canal du Midi to Toulouse, and then back to Paris via Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. He loved practically every moment. Jefferson kept extensive notes of this trip, with observations on everything from Roman antiquities to the price of dung, but Roy and Alma Moore, the authors of THOMAS JEFFERSON'S JOURNEY TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $29.95), choose to lean heavily on his enthusiastic letters to his friends. Jefferson's words are balanced by the Moores' photographs of the sites and cities Jefferson visited. There is a charming, informative introduction by Lucia C. Stanton, a historian at Monticello. The book, however, makes no pretension to scholarship. There isn't an index, for example, and some of the recipients of Jefferson's letters are cursorily identified. The photographs seldom show people, which makes sense; even so, there is something predictable about them. The juxtaposition of period prints and maps with modern-day photographs is effective, however. This book is a simple and easy introduction to this dazzling interlude in Jefferson's life.

us,'I Did Not Join the Hebrew Faith -- I Returned',"I grew up on the island of Monserrat, and my parents were supposed to be Christian. But in the years that I was home I always wondered why my people were so particular about what they did. We did not eat pork. My uncles were all circumcised. We ate challah bread on Friday night. If we had an animal that died by itself we did not eat it -- we would kill an animal by tying the hind legs, cutting the throat and allowing the blood to fall back to the earth where it came from. All of that we did, and we did not know why we were doing it -- because they told us that we were Christians. But I knew something was wrong, see? My grandfather told my mother we came from West Africa. And many years later I heard that the people on Monserrat were Hebrews that were taken as slaves from Ghana and carried to the island. So that's why this was. ",1999-09-26T05:00:00+0000

There are bear-trimmed nylon shells ($275), pressed pink crocodile jackets ($300), knee-length leopard skirts ($250) and a Persian lamb peacoat ($550). The owners, Jenny Green, 28, and her stepmother, Susan Green, 38, opened the shop for people who think fur is easier to wear when it's fake. ''Even though people think it's luxurious, they are self-conscious about it,'' Jenny Green said. ''Ours you can wear and never think twice. It'll never be a conscience issue.'' And as she pointed out, a fake mink vest is more practical at a rock concert. Most designs are by Shannon McLean, on the Trufaux label. But there are also giraffe skirts by Uniform ($175), burgundy ultraleather motorcycle pants by Trina Turk ($295) and leopard cowboy hats by James Coviello ($240). The shop, which also offers custom clothes, is convincing.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Armed and Crazy,"Michael Blaine's first novel, THE DESPERATE SEASON (Rob Weisbach/Morrow, $24), is a literate thriller about a what happens when a young mental patient named Maurice Coleman dismisses himself from an institution, throws away his medication, buys a semiautomatic rifle and holds his family hostage in a secluded cabin in the woods. Blaine tells this story from a variety of perspectives. Among the voices are Maurice's mother, Moira, a topiary gardener who sometimes dreams of escaping her past into a ''sudden, new life''; his younger sister, Crissie, whom Maurice desires carnally; and Nathan, Maurice's father, who loves him unconditionally. For much of the novel, these narrators describe scenes that take place before, or on the periphery of, the crisis at the cabin, so that we dangle over the drama's center with a sense of vertigo. That center might best have been seen obliquely; this novel's more subtle virtues are trampled by scenes of unbridled madness and violence. But this fault does not negate this book's strengths, especially Blaine's consideration of how a family feels complicit when a member goes astray. Nathan's lover, Julia, is fascinated by the idea of what she calls ''referred pain''; she thinks that the aches between Nathan's shoulders ''may have nothing to do with their own muscles,'' but might be reflecting grief elsewhere. Crissie realizes that pain can also be transferred between closely related people because ''everybody in a family with a kid like Maurice feels like it's their fault.'' Later, she confesses: ''Even when I think about myself I think about him.'' Charles Wilson",1999-09-26T05:00:00+0000

A reimagining of Vladimir Nabokov's ''Lolita'' from Lolita's point of view, the novel, by Pia Pera, comes out next month after narrowly avoiding an expensive and divisive lawsuit. ''Lo's Diary'' was originally published in Italy in 1995, but it was not until Farrar, Straus & Giroux announced plans for an English-language translation last year that Dmitri Nabokov, the author's son, sued. He claimed copyright infringement, maintaining that Pera's novel borrowed unacceptably from ''Lolita,'' that fewer people would buy Nabokov's masterpiece as a result, and thus that the new novel would ''inflict immeasurable losses'' on one of the ''towering literary works of this century.'' Farrar, Straus backed down, and there the matter stood until Barney Rosset, head of Foxrock Inc., stepped in. As the attorney representing Foxrock, I argued that Pera's work was transformative in nature, and thus encouraged under the law. In the end, we worked out an agreement that allowed Pera to publish her novel in the United States and Britain, with a preface by Dmitri Nabokov and half the author's share of royalties to be donated to PEN.

The appetite in the print trade is presently for real stuff  the dirt, the poop, the nitty-gritty  and not for the obliquities and tenuosities of fiction. A writer is almost never asked to write a story, let alone a poem; instead he or she is invited to pen introductions, reviews, and personal essays, preferably indiscreet. (Pen them, then fax them. Instant modemed communication and rapidly overlapping semes are a la mode.) Human curiosity, the abettor and stimulant of the fiction surge between Robinson Crusoe's adventures and Constance Chatterley's, has become ever more literal-minded and impatient with the proxies of the imagination. Present taste runs to the down-home divulgences of the talk show  psychotherapeutic confession turned into public circus  and to investigative journalism that, like so many heat-seeking missiles, seeks out the intimate truths, the very genitalia, of Presidents and princesses. It is as if, here at the end of a millennium, time is too precious to waste on anything but such central, perennially urgent data. And so it has come to pass that, in the 1990s, as I turned sixty and then reached sixty-two (senior discount at the movies!) and then passed retirement age, instead of devoting myself wholly to the elaboration of a few final theorems and dreams couched in the gauzy genres of make-believe, I have cranked out, in response to many a plausible request, the mass of more or less factual matter, of assorted prose, which Knopf has herewith heroically, indulgently printed and bound, my fifth such collection and  dare we hope?  my last.

For over 50 years, as the Chief of Head and Neck Surgery at Saint Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, Dr. Conley cured thousands of patients with cancer, ameliorated pain for countless others, and educated several generations of surgeons who were inspired by the artistry and precision of his surgical technique and his remarkable medical insights. Dr. Conley was a masterful surgeon and also a prolific poet, artist and in recent years, a leader in the emerging and critical endeavor of medical ethics. Through Dr. Conley's generosity and mentoring, and in partnership with the Sisters of Charity whom he loved and respected, the John J. Conley Department of Ethics was established in 1998 at Saint Vincents. In his life, Dr. Conley achieved well deserved international recognition and acclaim for his pioneering advances in surgical oncology. More important to him, as he wrote in one of his books of poetry, ''Vocal Painting'', Dr. Conley was completely ''dedicated to the hope that man will survive his evolution and carry the ethic of respect as part of his equivalents''. We will miss him greatly but will try to emulate him through all the years of our lives. We extend our deepest sympathies to Dr. Conley's wife, Monika, other members of his family and so many others who were close to and enriched by knowing him.

The stamps, which celebrate German design, feature a 1958 television by Herbert Hirche, a 1969 ergonomic water bottle, a monorail designed by Alexander Neumeister, and Mono-A, a stainless steel place setting from 1959 that seems timeless. Peter Raacke, who designed the flatware, said Mono-A was ''ecologically friendly,'' because it minimized the waste of stainless steel in production. Its minimalist look keeps the focus ''on the food, not the flatware,'' he said. Moss sells Mono-A for about $103 a place setting (note that the Germans do not use a salad fork) but, alas, does not carry the stamps.
