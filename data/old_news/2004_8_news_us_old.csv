From the glowing pastels, sockless loafers and stubble of ''Miami Vice'' to Tom Cruise's gray hair in ''Collateral,'' Mann has evoked a revolutionary kind of cool. He has a precise instinct for how his men want to dress and live, and that sensibility, that particular code of tough guys who know how to wear a suit, pick a perfect bottle of wine and shoot a gun, has shaped a generation. Mann is prickly about this idea -- he doesn't want his work reduced to shoes and architecture.

Per joined the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Utah in 1971 and remained there, with brief interruptions as Visiting Scholar at the University of Copenhagen and Cambridge University (Robinson College). Per was a social anthropologist initially interested in cognition, but whose restless mind soon wandered to the classic topics of social structure and kinship. He pioneered the use of graph theoretical models in anthropology to greatly enhance our knowledge of the human mind, human society and human history, especially in his beloved Polynesia. The three books he wrote (co-authored with Frank Harary), Island Networks, Exchange in Oceania, and Structural Models in Anthropology, have been the cornerstones of a new appreciation of kinship in all of social science. Always generous with his time for students and colleagues alike, he was most often found in his office quietly reading in one of a number of languages in which he was fluent or writing another article or book.

Miguel de Unamuno, the relentlessly idealizing Spanish philosopher, considered Don Quixote a ""profoundly Christian epic"" and the true Spanish bible, and correspondingly managed to write about the novel as if not a single comic episode occurs in it. W. H. Auden thought that Don Quixote was a portrait of a Christian saint; and Unamuno's unlikely American supporter, Harold Bloom, reminds us that although "" Don Quixote may not be a scripture,"" it nonetheless contains us all as Shakespeare does-which sounds more like religious lament than secular caution.

At the time, Rilke, fastidious and recently married, was equipped with only halting French; Rodin, unable to read Rilke's lyrical German, was an imperious 62, his creative drive matched only by his skill at seducing the women who posed nude for him. Combining Daniel Slager's elegant translation from the German of Rilke's writings on Rodin with Michael Eastman's photographs of Rodin's sculptures, AUGUSTE RODIN (Archipelago, $30) offers a fresh look at an unlikely mentorship. Adopting the rapturous tone of a new disciple, Rilke finds in Rodin's sculpture much of his own ideal of the solitary genius -- ''sheltered behind the efforts that sustained him'' and ''filled with the animating burden of his vast knowledge.'' But he may be closer to the mark, as the evocative photographs suggest, in portraying Rodin as a keen student of the flesh.

us,Technology Briefing | Software: Synopsys Income Is Below Forecasts,"Synopsys Inc., a maker of computer software, said yesterday that third-quarter net income and sales were below its forecasts because of lower-than-expected bookings. In a preliminary release of results for the three months ended July 31, the company said net income was 15 cents to 19 cents a share, below its forecast of 20 cents to 25 cents. Sales fell to $279 million to $283 million, below a forecast of $300 million to $320 million. Synopsys said its book-to-bill ratio was 0.7 to 1, compared with an expected 1-to-1 ratio. A ratio of 1 or more implies that orders are expanding. Synopsys, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., scrapped a plan in April to acquire Monolithic System Technology Inc. and paid Monolithic a $10 million breakup fee after the developer of semiconductor technology sued. Third-quarter profit excluding some items was 31 cents to 34 cents a share, the company said. Shares of Synopsys fell $4.20, or 16.7 percent, to $21.05.",2004-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The agency requested that Yukos provide documents for the inspection, the Prime-Tass news agency reported. Yukos already owes $3.4 billion in taxes for the year 2000 and is expected to pay a similar amount for 2001. Earlier yesterday, a Russian court ruled that Yukos, the country's largest oil producer, did not have to pay a late fee of 6.7 billion rubles ($223 million) to court bailiffs for a delay in paying its original tax bill. Yukos failed earlier this summer to meet a deadline to pay 99.4 billion rubles ($3.4 billion) as part of a battle with the government over its tax bill. Analysts have said the final tax bill for Yukos could approach $10 billion. The government's pursuit of Yukos is continuing as its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, is on trial for fraud and tax evasion; both are considered to be politically motivated investigations. Erin E. Arvedlund (NYT)",2004-08-03T05:00:00+0000

Godwin Austen, a 28,250-foot Himalayan peak which had never before been climbed. K2, as the mountain is known to climbers, ranks second only to Mt. Everest, which was scaled for the first time by a British expedition in May, 1953. But it has always been considered the more difficult ascent due to the precipitous character of its final approaches. A message from the expedition's leader, Prof. Ardito Desio, heard by the Pakistan radio, said the group fought its way to the summit last Saturday [July 30] after several months of battling up jagged slopes which claimed the life of one member of the party. Dr. Desio did not give the names of the men who actually reached the summit. He was apparently acting in accordance with the precedent set by the ill-fated American expedition which tried to conquer the peak last year. The American leader had announced that if it were successful the names of the actual men to reach the summit would be withheld. ",2004-08-04T05:00:00+0000

He also acknowledged falsifying a document authorizing the manuscript to leave France. But the French daily Libration quoted investigators as saying that as many as 100 manuscripts may have been stolen. Officials at the library said that while they were aware of many missing documents and books, an anonymous letter tipped them off to Mr. Garel's alleged involvement. Mr. Garel, who joined the library in 1976, was arrested in his office last Thursday and released on Friday after he was formally charged. Officials said the investigation was continuing.

Yet, beyond the state-owned Port of New Hampshire, Market Street leads to a charming downtown filled with eccentric and upscale galleries, restaurants and bars. That's the Portsmouth paradox: It's a seacoast town without a beach, an escapist retreat with a decidedly real-world spin. Settled in 1623, Portsmouth grew to importance as a shipbuilding center making wood-masted ships for the King's Navy. Four fires in the first half of the 1800's led the residents to build with brick, creating a legacy of remarkable 19th-century city architecture. For most people heading north to Maine, Portsmouth is simply an exit off Interstate 95. But anyone who takes the time to stop and explore will undoubtedly be charmed by this working-class town that has expanded to comfortably include cozy inns, unusual boutiques and a stylish vacation attitude.

us,ENRON SEEKS TO BLOCK FEDERAL PENSION FUND TAKEOVER,"The Enron Corporation has asked the court overseeing its bankruptcy case to block efforts by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to take over four of the company's retirement plans. In court papers filed Wednesday, Enron accused the agency of frustrating its reorganization efforts and usurping the bankruptcy court's authority to consider claims against the company. The pension agency's objection to Enron's reorganization plan was overruled by the bankruptcy court, and the plan was confirmed on July 15. The pension agency is trying to proceed with an action it filed June 3 in the federal court in Houston to terminate the four underfunded pension plans. Separately, a former Enron trading executive pleaded guilty yesterday to charges he manipulated energy markets during California's power crisis in 2001. John Forney, 42, is the third Enron executive to plead guilty to manipulating electricity prices from the company's trading office in Portland, Ore., which is now defunct.

They said that ''similarly false and scientifically unsound'' reports and testimony might have been offered in many other cases and they called for a comprehensive audit. Chief Hurtt, who came to the department this year, said that problems that occurred in testing in the past were ''an embarrassment'' and that the laboratory, now under a new director, was determined to ''right any wrongs.''

And there are few better places to fulfill that revelation than Ob-Co's Donuts in Toms River. My friend Sal Principato says that in the 1960's his family went there every Sunday after church. Choosing didn't take long, as there were only two varieties: plain and powdered. As I pulled into Ob-Co's gravel parking lot recently, I worried about what I'd report back to Sal. A sign on the sloping roof announced ''Ob-Co's Ice Cream.'' My fears subsided as I stepped up to the walk-up window of the building with red aluminum siding. Ob-Co's had merely added ice-cream treats to the menu; its raison d'tre is still doughnuts.",2004-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Born Nancie Harriet Brown on October 12, 1917, in Milwaukee, WI, she was the daughter of Victor L. Brown and Harriet Z. Brown, longterm residents of Milwaukee. Her father Victor, an immigrant from Denmark, graduated in the very first class of Harvard Business School and became a successful financier. His Milwaukeebased firm, Motors Acceptance, pioneered automobile finance in the United States. Nancie attended Downer Seminary in Milwaukee, Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, CT, and Vassar College. In 1938 she was married to Thomas Nichols of New York, NY, then an executive with E.I. DuPont and subsequently a member of the U.S. Government War Production Board and the Harriman Mission to London. They were divorced in 1944 and in 1947 she married George J. Stewart of London, UK, and New York, NY. Mr. Stewart was a wellknown Lloyds underwriter and broker, whose firm Stewart, Smith maintained offices in many countries. From 1956 to 1974 Mr. Stewart was the owner of Sam Lord's Castle in Barbados. They lived in New York City and London. Mr. Stewart died in 1975 and Nancie married Harold C. Palmer. The couple lived in New York City and Indian Wells, CA. Palmer died in 1988. For many years, Nancie played a very prominent role in numerous New York City charities. In addition to being a vice president of the Junior League, from 1956 to 1970, Nancie was Chairman of the Day Care Council of New York City, a pioneering agency for early childhood care and education, and subsequently became a national vice president of that agency. She was also active with the International Social Service and the Hunger Task Force. For many years Nancie had been a member of the Colony Club and Cosmopolitan Club in New York City, and the Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells, CA. She is survived by her four children: Timothy Nichols of Annapolis, MD, and Jamaica, VT, George J. Stewart of San Francisco, CA, Victor E. Stewart of Ridgewood, NJ, and Caroline Nation, of New York City, as well as three grandchildren. An older sister, Victoria, died in 1958.

us,Rhythmic Gymnastics," In the late 19th century, a new form of gymnastics developed, combining conventional gymnastics and dance - with a twist. Rhythmic gymnastics required the agility and grace of artistic gymnastics, but used props: a rubber ball, a nearly 20-foot satin ribbon attached to a baton, a hula hoop and two clubs resembling bowling pins. The women gymnasts leap, contort and flip while incorporating the props into their routines. It made its Olympic debut in 1984 in the individual all-around. In 1996, the group events, which feature five gymnasts at once, were added to the Games. At Athens, Russia is favored to win the group event. In the all-around, Alina Kabaeva of Russia, the 2000 bronze medalist and 2003 world champion, is the top contender.

us,Trampoline," Primitive versions of the trampoline first bounced into the world long before the sport made its Olympic debut in 2000. Eskimos used walrus skins to catapult their friends into the air by lifting and lowering the skins. In circuses, trapeze artists used springy nets for safety. In 1936, after seeing those circus nets, a University of Iowa student, George Nissen, a diver and a gymnast, fastened a piece of canvas to a steel frame with pieces of rubber inner tube. His invention was used for exercise in universities, then for more serious pursuits like training American pilots in World War II. Now, the sport of trampoline, part of the International Gymnastics Federation, consists of a routine of twists and somersaults, some done at more than 30 feet in the air. The gold medalists from 2000, Aleksandr Moskalenko and Irina Karavaeva of Russia, will be back at the Games, but last year's world champions, Karen Cockburn of Canada and Henrik Stehlik of Germany, are two of the favorites.

In great classic novels -- ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Madame Bovary'' and ''The Age of Innocence'' are three Gornick mentions -- choosing love over marriage was momentous; the hero or heroine would have to sacrifice ''everything'' (that is, the bourgeois respectability that defined his or her existence) for passion.

But Fed officials predicted last month that the recent ''soft patch'' would be temporary, and they are almost certainly loath to change gears after having warned investors for months about the need to raise rates gradually from their lowest levels since the 1950's.

us,"Anthony Mann, Hollywood Soldier","THE Film Society of Lincoln Center is calling its gratifyingly large retrospective of the director Anthony Mann ''Dark Streets and Vast Horizons,'' a rubric that pretty accurately evokes the elusive, almost self-contradictory nature of this remarkable filmmaker's career. Those dark streets and those vast horizons refer to the genres in which Mann did a good deal of his most striking work, more or less successively: film noir in the late 40's, westerns in the 50's; the horizons, it should be said, are also on the vast side in his big-budget historical epics of the early 60's, ''El Cid'' and ''The Fall of the Roman Empire.'' But even the Film Society's attractive binary formulation can't quite account for the weird volatility of Mann's work. The 25 pictures screening at the Walter Reade Theater in Manhattan between Wednesday and Aug. 29 reveal a filmmaker who is, in every sense, all over the map.",2004-08-08T05:00:00+0000

The reader was the second secretary of the district Party committee, Pyotr Klimovich Porosyaninov, a plump, well-nourished, red-cheeked, bald man with thick, moist ears covered in whitish bristles-his surname, with its obvious resemblance to the Russian word for ""piglet,"" suited him very well. In fact, in Dolgov there were many people with names that had meanings. There was even a period when the town possessed simultaneously a head of militia called Tiuryagin (an obvious hint at the word ""tiuryaga,"" or jail), a public prosecutor called Strogii (meaning ""strict"") with a deputy who rejoiced in the name of Vorovaty (""light-fingered""!), a judge called Shemyakin (reminiscent of the seventeenth-century hanging judge Shemyaka) and a head of the department of public education called Bogdan Filippovich Nechitailo (a surname which could be interpreted to mean ""illiterate"").

It made its Olympics debut in Atlanta in 1996 as a two-on-two event. In Athens, the tandem of Dain Blanton and Jeff Nygaard are favored to win a third consecutive gold medal for the American men. The women's twosome of Misti May and Kerri Walsh are the world champions, but had their prospect of winning the first women's medal for the United States jeopardized when May sustained an abdominal sprain in late May.

The case is being closely watched in Hartford because, depending how the court rules, state ethics laws may be re-examined. With Hartford slowly extricating itself from the tangled scandals of former Gov. John G. Rowland's administration, the New Milford case threatens to sidetrack a Legislature trying to restore public trust in government. Judge John Pickard of Litchfield Superior Court, who is hearing the case, said last month that his initial research had found nothing in state statutes that give local commissions much enforcement power. If he rules that way, lawmakers say it could set precedent throughout the state, keeping the commissions from publicly investigating or recommending sanctions against public officials who violate ethics rules.",2004-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Before O. J.,"Fatty Arbuckle was one of the brightest stars of the silent film era -- at least until 1921, when he was accused of raping and murdering a young actress named Virginia Rappe in a San Francisco hotel room. Though he was tried three times and found not guilty, the notoriety wrecked Arbuckle's career. In I, FATTY (Bloomsbury, $23.95), a novel by Jerry Stahl, the author of the memoir ''Permanent Midnight,'' Arbuckle tells his own story, beginning with his birth to a poor family in Kansas and ending with the alcohol- and drug-induced haze of his post-scandal years. Despite Stahl's aggressive wordplay, ''I, Fatty'' resembles more than anything one of those Hollywood rise-and-fall biographies on television, a collection of short episodes united by the protagonist's determination to explain himself, usually as a victim of circumstance. Comedy was Arbuckle's response to his abusive father, his drug addiction the fault of a crooked doctor and the Rappe scandal happened because of a combination of heartless studio heads, a puritan establishment and an insatiable tabloid press. It all sounds familiar, and that's perhaps the principal insight of ''I, Fatty'': that in 80 years, Hollywood hasn't changed all that much. Campbell Robertson",2004-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Her name disappeared from print until a few years ago, when it began appearing in New York theater reviews (although not too many critics showed up when she and her friends produced ''No Exit'' in the Times Square subway station at midnight). Ms. Howard made film industry news last year when the Danish director Lars von Trier chose her to star in ''Manderlay'' after Nicole Kidman dropped out. (Set in a town where slavery has lingered into the 1930's, it is the second film in his proposed American trilogy, which began with ''Dogville.'') And now that M. Night Shyamalan's eerie new costume drama, ''The Village,'' has opened big, she's in the public eye for good.

It is said that the gang leader's prison mates had become jealous as a result of the large number of visitors whom he has received since he was sentenced two months ago. The transfer was ascribed officially to the over-crowded condition of the Holmesburg jail. It has been learned from other sources, however, that prison officials felt that ""perhaps Capone would be safer at the Eastern 'Pen' than at Holmesburg."" It is reported that Capone had been a model prisoner, but that the attitude of others had caused alarm for his safety. His bodyguard, Cline, who was convicted at the same time, remains at Holmesburg. Each is serving a one-year sentence on charges of carrying concealed weapons. ",2004-08-10T05:00:00+0000

Officials said Ms. Yates had been charged with endangering the welfare of a child because she baby-sat in the apartment where her son, Antoine, 37, kept a tiger named Ming. Mr. Yates pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment last month and will be sentenced on Sept. 16. Ming was given a new home in October on a wildlife preserve in Ohio.

""The direct cause of suicide is the awareness of the frustration of ideals or ambition, said Dr. Moloney. This may be either real or imagined.

At the same time, he admitted forging paintings and selling them as valuable ""old masters."" Three others were implicated: Dietrich Fey, an art dealer; Dr. Bruno Fendrich, architect of the ancient Marienkirche here, and Theo Dietrich, a fellow artist. In a pre-trial statement, Mr. Malskat declared that 15th-century frescoes, almost erased by age, were uncovered in the Marienkirche after it was burned out by an Allied air raid. Mr. Fey was commissioned to restore them, Mr. Malskat said, and hired him and Mr. Dietrich as artists. After examining the frescoes the four decided that they had deteriorated too much to be restored. So brand-new frescoes were painted on the walls.

It is perhaps a measure of the continued challenge that Brakhage poses to our habitual ways of thinking about art and its various media that his films, which are mostly without dialogue, text or words of any kind, are more often compared to poetry than to other, presumably nearer forms of visual expression.",2004-08-13T05:00:00+0000

The surplus, which was well above the forecasts of economists, resulted from increased demand worldwide as well as the economic recovery in the United States, the agency said. The government agency said that exports from Canada rose 4.4 percent during June. At the same time, imports fell 3.7 percent. Much of the decline in imports reflected reduced imports of machinery and other equipment, particularly from the United States. Over all, Canadian exports to the United States rose 2.9 percent while purchases from the United States declined 3.6 percent. Canada's trade surplus with the United States stood at 10.7 billion Canadian dollars, its second-highest level in history. Ian Austen (NYT)",2004-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Shouting in Color,"After a divine visitation in her kitchen in 1934, Gertrude Morgan, then 34, left her family in Georgia; eventually she arrived in New Orleans, where she sang and preached the Gospel in the streets. Some two decades and several revelations later, she was instructed to become the bride of Christ and to add the making of art to her activities in the service of the Lord. The image of the black missionary dressed in bridal white (a uniform that she wore every day until her death at 80) and holding hands with Jesus recurs in Morgan's inspired paintings, blending biblical stories and autobiography. In TOOLS OF HER MINISTRY: The Art of Sister Gertrude Morgan (American Folk Art Museum/Rizzoli, $35), the art historian William A. Fagaly, who knew Morgan personally, gives a terrific portrait of this self-taught artist, who looks to us both endearing and egotistical, a bit spooky and as loud and commanding as her art. With no more than a third-grade education, Morgan achieved considerable fame in her lifetime for her paintings -- which she used as teaching aids and advertisements for her ministry -- thanks both to her fanatical drive and the efforts of an art dealer, Larry Borenstein, who discovered her shouting through her paper megaphone on a street corner around 1960 and invited her to perform and show her work at his gallery in the French Quarter. Of her miraculous talents, Morgan said: ''Just be sure and give Jesus credit for what I do. . . . He's the one that made me do it.'' Hilarie M. Sheets",2004-08-15T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Milliken's 50 years of service with the National MS Society began with the Chicago Chapter, where he served on its Board of Trustees from 1954 to 1980. In 1980 he became a Trustee of the Maine Chapter. He was elected to the Society's National Board of Directors in 1973, and in 1996 was named an Honorary Life Director. Mr. Milliken had a long career as an insurance executive, and was Vice President of Alexander & Alexander, Inc. in Chicago. He is survived by his wife; their children, Amelia Rowell, Alida Zimmerman, John Jr, MD, Mark and Scott; 14 grandchildren; and one greatgrandchild.

They have in common a respect for the sensual end of disappointment and resignation, for the erotic implications of the stiff upper lip. Dusty Springfield presides over them all; Chrissie Hynde, Beth Gibbons, Tracey Thorne, Aimee Mann and Beth Orton are her descendants; and the newest is Erin Moran, who performs as A Girl Called Eddy. (She's not to be confused with the actress from the old ''Happy Days'' series.) Ms. Moran comes from Neptune, N.J., and recorded ''A Girl Called Eddy'' (Anti-), her first full-length album, in England, produced by Richard Hawley of the band Pulp.

The impact has been swift. Struggling with 30 percent support last year, Mr. Chavez now has the backing of about 50 percent of Venezuelans.

Then he let go a spiel which involved some loud bits of news and a few announcements. The bellowing was much better than Bill Cruttenden, of Hastings, could put out and the local crier took second place. Each crier wore his costume of office. It usually started off with a three-cornered hat, wig, lace collar, velvet coat, waistcoat, knickers, tight socks and silver-buckled shoes. Everyone had a big bell and clanged away to draw attention. They performed in front of William the Conqueror's castle, which was built soon after the Battle of Hastings in 1066. ",2004-08-16T05:00:00+0000

It ends with comments by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, condemning the Swift boat group's advertisement and calling on Mr. Bush to do the same. The White House says that Mr. Bush met all of his military requirements and received an honorable discharge and that it has nothing to do with the Swift boat group.

The discount carriers flew 20 percent more seats in May than four years earlier, according to a report by the Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General, while the network airlines capacity was down 16 percent. Reflecting the relentless pressure that low-cost carriers have kept on their bigger competitors, average air fares for a 1,000-mile trip dropped to $116 from $147 over that period. Underlining the trend toward driving rather than flying short distances, the report said that there were 27 percent fewer scheduled flights of under 250 miles in May than in May 2000, but there were 9 percent more flights of over 1,000 miles. Southwest had a 59 percent share of the low-cost market in May, followed by America West with 12 percent and Air Tran with 8 percent. Meanwhile, the propeller-driven airplane is rapidly becoming scarce on commercial flights. Flights by turboprop and piston-engine aircraft fell 63 percent in May over May 2000.

Speaking to a backyard gathering in the farming community of Willard, Mo., above, Mr. Edwards said a Kerry-Edwards administration would work to bring venture capital to small towns with a $1 billion initiative over four years that would help finance small businesses and double financing for a program that helps small and midsize manufacturers adopt new technologies. In addition, he called for full financing for a federal program that provides for the hiring of law enforcement officers to combat the increasing production of methamphetamines, and he promoted further extension of broadband Internet into rural areas. ''There are many places in rural India where Internet makes it easier for an international business to do business than in rural Missouri,'' he said. Mr. Edwards, who was raised in small towns in the Carolinas, is seen by the Kerry campaign as potentially bolstering the ticket in rural areas. Thomas Crampton (NYT)",2004-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Irwin began his relationship with the Modern in 1960, when David Rockefeller introduced him, and his wife Xenia, to the Museum's then curator, Dorothy Miller. Miss Miller suggested some galleries to visit where the couple was introduced to and began collecting works by Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, and Milton Resnick. Ten years later, Irwin was elected to MoMA's Board of Trustees and served for five years, after which he became a Life Trustee. Of course, Irwin's greatest legacy is the very town in which he lived. Through the Cummings Engine Foundation, Irwin turned Columbus, Indiana into a living repository of modern architecture by commissioning public works from masters such as Eliel and Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, and Richard Meier. He embodied corporate responsibility as one of the first executives to believe that corporations should engage in the communties where their businesses were located.

The irreverent show, which imagines the talk show host in hell, is to open on Broadway in October 2005. As was originally reported in The New York Post, Allan McKeown, one of the producers, said the show should not be mounted for more than $7 million, considerably less than the $11 million that his partner, Avalon Promotions Ltd., is aiming for. ''I believe that we have to reduce its scale for it to be a success,'' Mr. McKeown said. He added that the cast of 33 would need to be trimmed to 15. ''I hope we reach an agreement, but until such time, the New York production will not go on,'' said Mr. McKeown, who has two other Broadway shows in the works for next year, including the musical ''Lennon,'' featuring John Lennon songs, and a star vehicle with Tracey Ullman, left. A representative for Avalon Promotions said they didn't need Mr. McKeown to mount the show. ''Avalon Promotions holds the American rights to 'Jerry Springer -- The Opera,' and Allan McKeown is not involved,'' said a spokesman for the production.

In an order Tuesday, the S.E.C. denied the request without identifying the security. The rejection means Berkshire may have to file amended disclosure statements for the quarters. The S.E.C., which denied a similar request by Berkshire in 2002, said the company had failed to show how disclosing the holding would hurt it. Berkshire's chief financial officer, Marc D.

The bank sold about 11 billion euros' worth of government debt over the course of a few minutes that day, most of it through electronic trades, then bought some of it back at much lower prices less than an hour later, bond traders say. Though Citigroup's activities were not illegal, they angered rival bond houses, who said the bank violated an unspoken agreement not to flood the market to drive down prices. The regulator said the investigation might lead to disciplinary proceedings. Citigroup said it was cooperating in the inquiry. Heather Timmons (NYT)",2004-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Software: Intuit Says Loss Widened To $42 Million,"Intuit Inc., the world's largest maker of tax preparation software, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter loss widened as the introduction of products for small businesses increased costs. The net loss widened to $42.1 million, or 22 cents a share, from $24.7 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales at the company, based in Mountain View, Calif., rose 13 percent, to $275.9 million in the quarter, which ended July 31. Expenses rose 16 percent, to $331.9 million. Intuit, the maker of TurboTax software, gets most of its sales during the United States tax season of January through April and typically reports a loss in the fourth and first quarters. The company is expanding its QuickBooks software products to tap small businesses, many with fewer than 100 workers, that do their own accounting and bookkeeping chores. Shares fell 29 cents, to $38.80, in extended trading. They rose 4 cents, to $39.09, in regular trading. Intuit said its loss this quarter would be 25 cents to 29 cents a share, compared with a 24-cent average estimate by 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. The company said sales would be $251 million to $263 million, compared with the $265.5 million average estimate of nine analysts. For the fiscal year 2005 ending on July 31, 2005, the company said it expected a profit of $1.82 to $1.90 a share on sales of $1.97 billion to $2.02 billion.",2004-08-19T05:00:00+0000

His proposal was one of several recommendations in a report calling for greater coordination between city and state licensing agencies. Retailers, wholesalers and distributors who sell cigarettes in the city are required to have both a city and a state license. The city's license -- which must be renewed every two years -- is issued by the city's Department of Finance and Department of Consumer Affairs. The state certification -- which must be renewed annually -- is issued by the state Department of Taxation and Finance. The report noted that more than 3,500 cigarette retailers have a valid state license but not a city one; of the surveyed city vendors, 153 -- or 48 percent -- had underpaid state taxes for a total of nearly $613,000 in 2002.

Irwin Miller, a businessman, philanthropist, and advocate for exceptional design. Irwin began his relationship with the Modern in 1960, when David Rockefeller introduced him, and his wife Xenia, to the Museum's then curator, Dorothy Miller. Miss Miller suggested some galleries to visit where the couple was introduced to and began collecting works by Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, and Milton Resnick. Ten years later, Irwin was elected to MoMA's Board of Trustees and served for five years, after which he became a Life Trustee. Of course, Irwin's greatest legacy is the very town in which he lived. Through the Cummings Engine Foundation, Irwin turned Columbus, Indiana into a living repository of modern architecture by commissioning public works from masters such as Eliel and Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, and Richard Meier. He embodied corporate responsibility as one of the first executives to believe that corporations should engage in the communties where their businesses were located. In doing so, Irwin forever changed the face of a city. He will never be forgotten, but he will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathies to the entire family.

It was a crucial reform, but in many places the ballots aren't working out the way they are supposed to because of poor procedures and overly technical regulations.

The glands were used to make human growth hormone, which is now created synthetically, and hospitals received just a few dollars for each gland.

Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said an approval notice posted on the department's Web site had led contractors to believe they had a scaffold permit and could begin the already-approved rooftop work at the church, St. Thomas the Apostle, on West 118th Street just off St. Nicholas Avenue. He said that the archdiocese expected to acquire a scaffold permit today and would apply soon for a permit to demolish the church.

Only son of Martin and Grete Breslauer of Berlin, he joined his father's firm of antiquarian booksellers in 1935, fleeing the Nazis in 1937 to settle in London, where after voluntary military service during the war he became the leading binding expert in the book trade. He advised and represented at auction the greatest private collectors and many institutional libraries in Europe and America. In 1977, he moved to New York to his apartment overlooking the Metropolitan Museum which became the inevitable port-of-call of visiting European bibliophiles. In 1978, he established a worldrecord price for a printed book by purchasing the Gutenberg Bible on behalf of the State Library of Wuerttemberg. He was the author of several authoritative monographs and a long series of scholarly and well-written catalogues. In 1997, the Free University of Berlin conferred on him an Honorary Doctorate of Letters for his contributions to bibliophily and bibliographical scholarship. Dr. Breslauer formed unmatched private collections of medieval manuscripts, illuminations and, most originally, of historical bibliography in finely bound association copies. He was also a discriminating patron of contemporary artistic bookbinders. In 1996, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a rare distinction. In 1998, the London quarterly journal, The Book Collector, devoted a special issue to mark Dr. Breslauer's 80th birthday. He will be greatly missed in the world of rare books.

Grant went to Galena in 1860 to be a clerk in his father's leather store, he was at the lowest point in his life -- a West Point graduate out of the Army and working far below his potential -- and the town was at a high. A few years later their positions reversed. While Grant soared as a war hero and two-term president, Galena, a Mississippi River boomtown that had 15,000 people at a time when Chicago claimed only 1,200, went into decline as steamboating gave way to railroads, its lead mines played out and its tributary to the river began to silt in. Galena today has just 3,500 residents, but, after another reversal of fortune beginning in the 1960's, it draws 1.3 million visitors a year. They come for festivals, for easy kayaking along the gently flowing Galena River, above, and the Grant history, but above all for the well-preserved 19th-century beauty of the town itself. The tourists crowding the shops, restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts that now occupy many of the old buildings come from far and wide, but most are from that one-time swamp village called Chicago.

Hudson, publisher of the conservative Roman Catholic magazine Crisis and until this week a top adviser to the Bush campaign, paid $30,000 to settle accusations of sexual misconduct brought by an 18-year-old student when he was her professor at Fordham University in 1994, according to an article on the Web site of The National Catholic Reporter and a person involved in a university investigation. In papers filed with Fordham at the time and quoted in the paper, the student said that after she became drunk with Mr. Hudson and a group of students at a Greenwich Village bar, he took her to his office, where at his suggestion they exchanged sexual favors. She accused him of sexual harassment, and the university revoked his tenure. On Wednesday, Mr. Hudson resigned as a Bush adviser in anticipation of the article.

Irwin Miller, a businessman, philanthropist, and advocate for exceptional design. Irwin began his relationship with the Modern in 1960, when David Rockefeller introduced him, and his wife Xenia, to the Museum's then curator, Dorothy Miller. Miss Miller suggested some galleries to visit where the couple was introduced to and began collecting works by Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, and Milton Resnick. Ten years later, Irwin was elected to MoMA's Board of Trustees and served for five years, after which he became a Life Trustee. Of course, Irwin's greatest legacy is the very town in which he lived. Through the Cummings Engine Foundation, Irwin turned Columbus, Indiana into a living repository of modern architecture by commissioning public works from masters such as Eliel and Eero Saarinen, I.M. Pei, and Richard Meier. He embodied corporate responsibility as one of the first executives to believe that corporations should engage in the communties where their businesses were located. In doing so, Irwin forever changed the face of a city. He will never be forgotten, but he will be sorely missed. We extend our sympathies to the entire family.

The court upheld a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit by a mother and son who had sued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because they said they were each sexually abused by the same man as children. According to the ruling, which was issued on Thursday, the church received several complaints from members from 1966 to 2002 that the man, George Tilson, was sexually abusing children. Mr. Tilson was a ''high priest'' in the church, but not a member of the clergy. The appeals court noted that the reported abuse had not occurred at the church and was not related to church activities. Mindy Sink (NYT)",2004-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Exports drove expansion, rising 27 percent, year on year, fostering growth in capital spending of 5.7 percent. Analysts said a slowdown in exports is expected because of faltering growth in Japan and the United States, leaving Korea increasingly dependent upon China, where demand has been strong. Domestic demand growth was 2.2 percent, reversing a decline in the previous quarter.

Searle Pharmaceutical Company until 1985, has died of complications from lung cancer at Lake Forest Hospital on August 19. Bill Searle was 76. Mr. Searle made his permanent home in Elko, Nevada where he owned Maggie Creek Ranch. He was an avid sportsman and actively involved in support of numerous environmental and educational organizations. ''I am the luckiest man I know. I can spend what time and talent is given me to try to make the world around me a little better place,'' Mr. Searle once said. Mr. Searle served on the boards of the Field Museum and Chicago Symphony Orchestra as well as the ShikarSafari Club International Foundation, the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, the Boone and Crockett Club, and the Western Folklife Center, Elko, Nevada. He was also the founding supporter of The Island School, an environmental and educational institution in South Eleuthera, Bahamas. He was a member of The Grand Island Lodge in Bath, Illinois. A University of Michigan graduate, Bill Searle was the manager of the 1951 Rose Bowl team. He was also a graduate of the Advanced Management Program of Harvard University. He served in the Army Chemical Corps during the Korean War. His wife, Sally Burnett Searle; his daughters Marion S. Searle, Elizabeth B. Searle, and Louise S. Klarr; his brother D.C.

Leading eight men in an Army squad on a patrol of the war-torn city, I got a taste, however approximate, of why Iraq is such a hard place to be a soldier these days. My job, as squad leader, was to order my soldiers where to go and what to do. First, I sent half of my men into an alleyway, where they immediately came under fire from insurgents hiding nearby. Scrambling for safety, I ordered us to duck into a building, pausing to marvel at the detail of the architecture. I then led us back out onto the street, directing my team to crouch behind a car while we tried to locate the snipers. This was a bad idea. Despite what you see in action movies and other video games, cars do not provide good cover from bullets. The snipers cut loose, and my troops crumpled to the ground. It was surprisingly distressing.

Poor people are kind to him, especially a plain, lonely Salvation Army worker (Kati Outinen) who tells him, ''It's all about mercy.''

He was 74. Mr. Titus was born in East Haven, CT and raised in Branford, CT. He served in the U.S. Army Air Force from 1947-1951. He graduated from Georgetown University and became a memer of the Physics Honor Society. He settled in Sudbury in 1970. Mr. Titus (Joe) was a major contributor to our nation's defense through inventions in space systems. He was a leader and an innovator, publishing many technical papers and holding many patents, and was a nationally recognized expert in cryogenic infrared optical sensors. Joe was a founder of the New England Research Center (NERC) and Sensor Systems Group (SSG, Inc.). Sensor systems engineering is an interdisciplinary skill - spanning optics, electronics, communications, and computing. Few practitioners of this art have ever achieved the level of performance, even briefly, that Joe was able to sustain throughout his career. A generous and compassionate man, Joe was often referred to as ''the smartest guy I've ever known.'' His many interests included cooking, fishing, boating, reading, tennis, and gardening. He was an avid skier, spending most winters at his second home in Steamboat Springs, CO, where his goal was to ski at least 100 days every year. Husband of Norma Jean (Mulder) Titus, he also leaves behind his five children: Robert W., Elizabeth A., Amy J., James M. and Daniel J.

From 7 to 11 (according to the schedule posted daily on the call board) he had ''Carps'' duty at the Williamstown Theater Festival's scenery shop. That particular evening, he wound up cutting wood into long strips of molding for the elaborate set of ''Design for Living,'' which would play for two weeks at the Adams Memorial Theater, starring Marisa Tomei, Campbell Scott and Steven Weber. It was not the worst assignment Mr. Rubin might have drawn. As an apprentice at the festival -- one of 70 -- he would be given, over the course of his 10 weeks there, a little taste of everything. Sometimes even that was too much; the job called ''Super'' meant picking cigarette butts and other garbage from the brilliant green lawn in front of the theater. Other jobs were hit or miss. ''Run Crew'' might mean operating a spotlight for the new musical ''R Shomon'' at the festival's smaller stage, the Nikos; or dressing its star, Audra McDonald; or mopping the deck or setting the props or filling actors' glasses with too much ice and getting upbraided for it. The best assignment was ''Lines,'' which meant helping one of the Equity actors (perhaps Ms. Tomei?) memorize her part.

us,The State of the George W. Bush Joke,"IN December 1992, just weeks before departing office, President George Herbert Walker Bush invited Dana Carvey to the White House. Mr. Carvey had spent the previous four years impersonating Mr. Bush on ''Saturday Night Live'' as a patrician wimp, and turning Bushisms like ''it's ba-a-ad'' and ''wouldn't be pru-dent at this juncture'' into national punch lines. But as Mr. Carvey performed from behind a podium in the East Room, the president, according to press accounts, laughed and looked happier than he had in weeks. It wasn't hard to see why: the humor was gentle and apolitical, making light of minor personal foibles. Speaking with reporters afterward, Mr. Bush recalled a conversation with the comedian: ''He said, 'I hope I've never crossed the line.' And I knew exactly what he meant. And as far as I'm concerned he never has.''",2004-08-22T05:00:00+0000

The library, founded in 1850 by Millard Fillmore, the 13th president, and his wife, Abigail, a schoolteacher and librarian, had some 270 books and 260 periodicals, including standard texts like a Bible, an atlas and a Webster's dictionary, along with George Catlin's ''North American Indian Portfolio'' and George Bancroft's ''History of the United States From the Discovery of the Continent.'' Other volumes included the Federalist Papers and a collection of law books. The National First Ladies' Library and the Bibliographical Society of America want to compile a complete catalog of the library that will include a history and an annotated list of its contents, reconstructed from surviving invoices, correspondence and memoranda, said Pat Krider, the executive director of the first ladies' library. But the group's final goal, Ms. Krider said, is to find as many of the 19th-century imprints in the library as possible -- exact editions or very close -- and display them in its library in Canton, Ohio.

The driver of the S.U.V., identified as Keith Haigbea, 38, of 166th Place in Jamaica, was charged with second-degree manslaughter, said a spokesman for the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. The authorities said that Mr. Haigbea had been drinking and that additional charges were possible pending the results of a blood alcohol test.

The first tire mountains to be tackled will be Pinnacle Tire in West Monroe, Oswego County, and Mohawk Tire in Waterford, Saratoga County. Each contains at least eight million tires collected by failed recycling businesses. Initial funding for the new recycling projects will come from a $2.50 fee collected on tires sold since 2003. Old tires are considered an environmental threat because they harbor mosquitoes and can emit hazardous smoke if they burn. About one million will become fill for construction of an overpass on Interstate 87 in Clinton County. Other priority sites are Hornburg Tire in Sinclairville, Chautauqua County; New York Tire in Smithtown, Suffolk County; and Cycletech in Hudson, Columbia County.

Mr. Vernon, who died in Virginia in 1996, heard Lester Flatt and Curly Seckler's song ''We Can't Be Darlings Anymore'' when he was 14, and told friends that he knew right then that bluegrass would be his calling. His family, however, urged him to follow his father into corporate tax work, and Mr. Vernon worked on Wall Street for 12 years. He moonlighted as a disc jockey on WBAI in New York, and left the city in 1970 for full-time radio jobs in Delaware and Virginia. ''If you asked Bill a question about old-time music, he always gave you the right answer,'' said Sonny Osborne of the Osborne Brothers. ''I miss him a whole lot.''

The benefits fund receives more than $120 million a year from the city and helps pay for prescription, optical and dental services for the union's 121,000 members. Ms. Roberts assumed control of the benefits fund board after the executive board dismissed four of its seven trustees and was about to name their replacements.

The show, with more than 200 20th-century masterworks from the Museum of Modern Art, is on view through Sept. 19. Writing in the national daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the historian, Werner Spies, a former director of the National Museum of Modern Art at the Pompidou Center in Paris, said the exhibition minimized the impact of European artists on new American painting in an ''outrageous way'' that ''seems to be downright colonialist.'' He argued that the failure to include European artists like Matisse, Max Ernst, Dubuffet and Giacometti in the part of the exhibition that focuses on the last 50 years of 20th-century art suggests that ''the Americans who chose the selections are engaging in cultural politics.'' His accusations were rebuffed by Peter Raue, the president of the Friends of National Gallery, who helped take the exhibition to Berlin. He said: ''It is completely exaggerated to talk about American colonialism in this context. Every visitor can easily figure out by himself that this is an American exhibition.''

Packer, and Maile Meloy. On the other hand John Updike's ''Early Stories: 1953-1975,'' which came out last year, a monumental collection by one of the form's great masters, earned glowing reviews and never cracked the New York Times best-seller list. Except for books by Louis L'Amour and Stephen King, the last short story collections to spend time on that list were Adam Haslett's ''You Are Not a Stranger Here,'' a Today show book club pick, and Lorrie Moore's ''Birds of America,'' published in1999, which may have been lofted there on the strength of a single piece, the knockout, heartbreaking ''People Like That Are the Only People Here,'' about a children's cancer ward. --",2004-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Prices Need To Fall 20%,"The Samsung Electronics Company, the world's largest maker of liquid crystal displays, said yesterday that L.C.D. prices need to fall 20 percent in the third quarter for demand to pick up in the final three months of the year. ''Prices, particularly for L.C.D. televisions, are too high for the average person,'' said Lee Sang Wan, president for the flat-screen display business of the company, based in Suwon, South Korea. ''The second-half outlook for the market looks soft.'' Demand will probably pick up in the fourth quarter, led by monitors, said Mr. Lee, who spoke to reporters at the International Meeting on Information Display in Daegu, south of Seoul. His comments underscored concern that producers might have overestimated consumers' willingness to replace glass tube screen televisions with slimmer L.C.D. versions at a premium. On Monday, the market researcher DisplaySearch cut its global L.C.D. sales outlook for 2004 by 13 percent, to $36 billion, citing rising inventories that are cutting the prices of flat televisions and computer monitors. The industry had 2003 sales of $24 billion. Shares of the world's five largest L.C.D. makers have fallen 13 percent to 31 percent in the last three months, amid concern that growth in demand will not live up to expectations. DisplaySearch said a 17-inch monitor that sold for $459 to consumers in the second quarter could fall as low as $299 to $349 by this holiday season in the United States.",2004-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,World Briefing | Europe: Vatican City: Icon To Be Returned To Russia,"A 12-by-10-inch Russian icon, the Mother of God of Kazan, plated in gold, bedecked in precious jewels and embroiled in a dispute between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches that has impeded Pope John Paul II from visiting Russia, is to be returned to Russia today on a military plane. The Vatican hopes that Russia will appreciate the return of the icon -- actually an 18th-century copy of an image that first appeared 200 years earlier in Kazan -- as a gesture of unity and reconciliation, and that it will help pave the way for a visit by the Slavic pope. John Paul has long desired to go to the country that he is often credited with helping to free from Communism, and to mend the centuries-old schism between the Orthodox and Catholic faiths. The icon disappeared from Russia sometime after the Bolshevik Revolution. It was bought by a Catholic group in the 1970's and later given to the pope. Jason Horowitz (NYT)",2004-08-27T05:00:00+0000

In brief, from 2001 through 2003, poverty increased, income stagnated and the ranks of the uninsured grew, while the United States spent some $400 billion on tax cuts, which mainly benefited wealthy families. The Bush administration seemed intent on minimizing the political impact of the report, releasing the data on Thursday, instead of the usual date in late September, to get it done before the convention. But the numbers spoke for themselves. Since Mr. Bush came to power, 4.3 million people have fallen below the poverty line, set at $18,660 for a family of four in 2003, bringing the total number of people living in poverty in 2003 to 35.9 million, or 12.5 percent of the American population.",2004-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The starting price for a 1.5-mile stretch of the estate, including five huge buildings, beaches and forest land, is a modest 125,000 euros ($151,000), because the German government has been trying to sell it for several years.

Troops are being rushed to the storm centres, but owing to the lack of communications, no sooner is one attack dealt with than another begins elsewhere. The situation is admittedly serious and today [Aug. 27] the Consuls of all nations held a meeting to urge the British authorities to take stringent measures to protect their nationals. Although no doubt is expressed that order will eventually be restored, it is admitted that this may take some time owing to the countryside character which the uprising has taken. Several more warships carrying troops and airplanes are reported to have arrived at Jaffa, and today two British battalions and several contingents of armed sailors and marines were dispatched in haste to the storm centres. Airplanes are also reconnoitering and landing troops wherever urgently needed. ",2004-08-28T05:00:00+0000

They are less apt to be married, own a car or a sport utility vehicle, and speak only English at home. Despite the differences, their median ages are similar: 34.2 (N.Y.C.) & 35.3 (R.O.A.), and average household size (2.6 persons) is the same. ANDREW HACKER",2004-08-29T05:00:00+0000

''A woman wrote in asking if we sold muzzles for children.'' They don't, but they do sell Tangee lipstick ($13), which changes color according to mood.

After all these years, Becky carries with her the aura of her many spiritual daughters: Scarlett O'Hara, Madonna, even Elle Wood, Ms. Witherspoon's smart dumb-blonde character from the ''Legally Blonde'' comedies. And while ''Vanity Fair'' remains essentially true to the setting of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 novel, it also offers a Becky Sharp for today, a 19th-century heroine who appeals to contemporary attitudes about class, ambition and women fending for themselves.",2004-08-29T05:00:00+0000

Loving husband of Mabel U, devoted father of June, Kay (Leighton Chen), Cynthia (Daniel Sedlis), Geraldine, and Newton, and proud grandfather of Christine, Stephanie and Lucy. In his autobiography, ''My Nine Lives'', NT wrote of his lives as number one son, traditional scholar, foreign student, public servant, instructor, international servant, advisor, academician, and immigrant. NT was born in Shanghai on July 25, 1917. Initially trained to be a Confucian scholar, he received a classical education at home, where he was tutored in Chinese poetry, painting, the Classics and other literati skills. Math, science, and languages were introduced later by his father, Pai Yuan (PY) Wang, a sophisticated banker when he decided to school his four sons in Western ways when they were teenagers. In 1937, NT went abroad to study at the London School of Economics and Germany. He transferred to Columbia where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with honors in economics in 1941, and went on to receive an M.A. and PhD in economics from Harvard. NT will be remembered throughout the international community for his dedicated efforts in advising businesses and governments around the world on ecomonic development. He made many contributions to his homeland of China, the U.S., his home since 1939, and to countless countries which he helped through his work at the U.N. Economic and Social Council. After retiring from a 28 year career at the United Nations, as the Director of the Centre on Transnational Corporations, he returned to Columbia Univ. to teach at the School of Business and the School of International and Public Affairs. He thoroughly enjoyed his time with his students, organizing seminars, creating training programs for Chinese academic and business leaders, and working tirelessly as the Director of the China-International Business Project. In his final days, he was polishing his keynote speech as part of Columbia University's 250th anniversary celebration. He was an honorary professor of ten universities, a fellow of the International Academy of Management, and a recipient of many awards, including the New York Governor's Award for Outstanding Asian American. In addition to his many professional achievements, his passions included dancing with his life partner of 62 years, Mabel, and playing tennis. NT exhausted his daughter Kay playing two and a half hours of tennis after celebrating his 87th birthday just one month ago. Throughout his life, he took time to compose classical Chinese poems, which his family will compile as the tenth chapter in his life, 'The Poet'. A memorial service will be announced later. Contributions may be made to Community Funds Inc. for the N.T. and Mabel Wang Charitable Fund, which will continue the mission of the China-International Business Project he established at Columbia University, c/o Community Funds Inc., 2 Park Avenue, NY, NY 10016",2004-08-29T05:00:00+0000

There is no age limit to this look: girls from 6 to, yes, 60 are donning pastel workout clothes and exposing their thongs when they bend over in their jeans. The look is all too often accessorized with DayGlo flip-flops and, lest anyone doubt the wealth of the casual dresser, a ridiculously enormous Birkin bag from Herms that screams money. Even when this ensemble looks, technically, good -- as when the body is tanned and toned and the sports bra is filled to bursting -- I always think anything else would look better.

''I Vitelloni,'' not even released in this country until after ''La Strada'' had made Fellini an art-house celebrity, nonetheless managed, by the beginning of the 70's, to work its way deep into the consciousness of several of the best young American filmmakers.

Since then I've been pulling out all my Guided by Voices albums. I once spent a month studying Doug Gillard's guitar parts before playing a show in a Guided by Voices tribute band. Figuring out the guitar solo for ''I Am a Tree'' made me feel more confident about using guitar solos in my music. And the album ''Bee Thousand'' blew me away from the first spin. I couldn't believe how many undeniable hooks they were cramming into a minute-and-a half tune. Robert Pollard is the most naturally charismatic frontman I have ever seen.

With a chance to become the Senate's only African-American member, Obama, a Harvard-educated civil rights lawyer, has been called ''the new Tiger Woods of American politics.'' Obama's memoir, reissued with a new preface, traces his unusual family history. His father, a black Kenyan, and his mother, a white American from Kansas, met and married in Hawaii (his father returned to Kenya when Obama was still young). Paul Watkins, writing in the Book Review in 1995, said Obama's memoir ''persuasively describes the phenomenon of belonging to two different worlds, and thus belonging to neither.''",2004-08-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BERKOWITZ, WILLIAM","BERKOWITZ--William. Age 62, died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Sarasota, FL, on Sunday, August 22, 2004, after a long battle with cancer. Mr. Berkowitz, as President of one of the nation's first and largest retail Money Market Mutual Funds, Dreyfus Liquid Assets, helped to transform the way Americans save. As he told ''Forbes'' in 1980, ''...the savings public is becoming more sophisticated. It will not stand for this 5% rate on passbooks (savings accounts).'' He fought against the regulation of the money market industry and welcomed competition from banks by testifying in favor of lifting Regulation Q--which prevented banks from paying prevailing high interest rates on savings accounts. In 1964 a twenty-three year old William ''Bill'' Berkowitz came to work at The Dreyfus Corporation, the New York based investment management firm. By 1974 Bill Berkowitz had become an officer of The Dreyfus Corporation, and soon thereafter he created and became President of Dreyfus Liquid Assets, one of the first retail oriented Money Market Mutual Funds. Dreyfus' money market services and assets grew to a top industry position under his leadership. By 1981 most of Dreyfus' $12.4 billion of assets under management was in short-term money in over 300,000 accounts. Bill became President of the Reich & Tang, L.P. Mutual Funds Group and Executive Vice President and Director of Reich & Tang L.P. in 1982. The Mutual Funds Group grew rapidly under his leadership until 1994 when Reich & Tang, L.P. merged with the asset management division of the New England Companies, creating one of the largest investment management companies in the world. He was also a VicePresident and Board member of various third party mutual funds like Gabelli Asset Growth, Equitable Life's money market mutual funds and Speers, Benzak, Solomon and Farrell Funds. He was born September 20, 1941, in Bronx, NY. Before receiving his Bachelor of Science in Finance from New York University in 1963, he attended Syracuse University and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan in 1959. He lived in Middletown, NJ, and commuted to New York City for 16 years before moving to Sarasota, FL, in 1982. He retired from Reich and Tang, L.P. in 1994. Through the William and Dale S. Berkowitz Family Foundation and through invididual efforts, Bill supported the Flanzer Jewish Community Center of Sarasota, FL, and its Maccabi Games. He also supported the Florida Studio Theatre and the Sarasota YMCA Foundation. Bill was an avid art collector and a patron of a number of local Sarasota artists. Survivors include his beloved wife of 41 years, Dale S.; a daughter and son in law, Dana B. and John Snyder of Columbia, MD; sons and daughters in law David L. and Patti C. of Middletown, NJ, Barry J. and Chrissy of Potomac, MD, and Jeffrey A. and Susan of Sarasota; a sister Harriet Fortgang of Atlanta; and six grandchildren, Matthew, Dylan, Daniel, Bryce, Anna and Alexandra.

Will they soon find it difficult or impossible to run or swim faster, jump higher or throw farther than their predecessors? A glance at the world record tables in swimming and in track and field, the central events of the quadrennial Olympics, yields a mixed answer. It looks as if the world's best swimmers are still surging ahead while the top track and field competitors are already stuck in the Dark Ages, unable to match records set years or even decades ago. One plausible explanation for the falloff is that many past records may have been artificially inflated by performance-enhancing drugs.

After more than 15 years in the wholesale eyewear business, Ken Finneran and Stan Blackmer, the owners of Fanny's, have amassed an absurd number of dead-stock, never-been-worn frames, from 18th-century spectacles to oversize 80's sunglasses. Besides the 4,000 pairs on display in their East Village shop, 335 East Ninth Street, 30,000 more are packed in a New Jersey warehouse. In the store, the glasses are organized in drawers: fancy readers; metal frames; tortoise rhinestone; blue cat's-eyes. Pricier items, like the very first designer glasses (gold Christian Dior frames, from around 1950), are in the window. Prices generally range from $35 to $135, but can run as high as an eye-popping $3,000. Finneran says he's always amazed by what's suddenly deemed cool again. Recently, a young woman in stiletto boots tried on rhinestone-encrusted green plastic frames that Finneran called ''very Elton John.'' ''Yeah,'' she said. ''They're for when I need to bling.''

Coast Guard officers initially stopped the boat, the My Way, in the harbor near Governors Island, because it was cruising without navigation lights, the authorities said. Under questioning, the owner and captain, Frank Mele, 52, of Weehawken, N.J., admitted having a 12-gauge shotgun, a .30-caliber rifle and an AK-47 on board, the authorities said, adding that they do not believe that the guns were part of any plot. The boat was escorted to a New York Police Department pier in Brooklyn, where its 22 passengers disembarked. The police said the captain had a license to carry the guns in Florida, but not New York. Mr. Mele was charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Shaila K. Dewan (NYT)",2004-08-30T05:00:00+0000

Loving husband of Mabel U, devoted father of June, Kay (Leighton Chen), Cynthia (Daniel Sedlis), Geraldine, and Newton, and proud grandfather of Christine, Stephanie and Lucy. In his autobiography, ''My Nine Lives'', NT wrote of his lives as number one son, traditional scholar, foreign student, public servant, instructor, international servant, advisor, academician, and immigrant. NT was born in Shanghai on July 25, 1917. Initially trained to be a Confucian scholar, he received a classical education at home, where he was tutored in Chinese poetry, painting, the Classics and other literati skills. Math, science, and languages were introduced later by his father, Pai Yuan (PY) Wang, a sophisticated banker when he decided to school his four sons in Western ways when they were teenagers. In 1937, NT went abroad to study at the London School of Economics and Germany. He transferred to Columbia where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with honors in economics in 1941, and went on to receive an M.A. and PhD in economics from Harvard. NT will be remembered throughout the international community for his dedicated efforts in advising businesses and governments around the world on ecomonic development. He made many contributions to his homeland of China, the U.S., his home since 1939, and to countless countries which he helped through his work at the U.N. Economic and Social Council. After retiring from a 28 year career at the United Nations, as the Director of the Centre on Transnational Corporations, he returned to Columbia Univ. to teach at the School of Business and the School of International and Public Affairs. He thoroughly enjoyed his time with his students, organizing seminars, creating training programs for Chinese academic and business leaders, and working tirelessly as the Director of the China-International Business Project. In his final days, he was polishing his keynote speech as part of Columbia University's 250th anniversary celebration. He was an honorary professor of ten universities, a fellow of the International Academy of Management, and a recipient of many awards, including the New York Governor's Award for Outstanding Asian American. In addition to his many professional achievements, his passions included dancing with his life partner of 62 years, Mabel, and playing tennis. NT exhausted his daughter Kay playing two and a half hours of tennis after celebrating his 87th birthday just one month ago. Throughout his life, he took time to compose classical Chinese poems, which his family will compile as the tenth chapter in his life, 'The Poet'. A memorial service will be announced later.

Reports from aid workers and African Union monitors have made it clear that the government has not reined in the militias, which are held responsible for the deaths of 30,000 Darfur villagers and the displacement of more than a million others. A July 30 Security Council resolution promised punitive measures in the absence of major improvement in 30 days, but United Nations diplomats do not believe the votes are there for imminent sanctions.

Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has made the first working memory chip that uses so-called 65-nanometer technology to shrink the circuits inside chips, an Intel researcher, Mark Bohr, said on a conference call. The method lets Intel pack twice the number of transistors into the same space. Chip makers including Intel and I.B.M. are racing to design production methods that let them cram more transistors into chips, resulting in more powerful devices that cost less to make. By being the first to use circuits measuring 65 nanometers, Intel is as much as 12 months ahead of competitors, said a Gartner Inc. analyst, Martin Reynolds.",2004-08-31T05:00:00+0000
