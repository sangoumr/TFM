Kids rebel because their parents don't trust them enough to let them breathe, not because they happen to know one boy with the wrong haircut. We in the Denver area recently witnessed what can happen when kids feel isolated and cornered. Unfortunately, the response of your parent interviewees, like that of the Denver school authorities, can only exacerbate the problem. More control, more restrictions and pointing a finger at such trivialities as eccentric costumes can only increase paranoia and isolation. Young people need more choices, not more rules, and a broad base of socializing experience; unless, that is, we want to continue the trend toward living in walled-in communities where schooling and shopping will take place via cable television and where individual difference and the urge to experience the world outside are criminalized.",1999-08-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Pass the Tums,"If there's such a thing as a socially acceptable food snob, Robert O. Williams is it. Williams is a diner snob, and in his quest for the best pie, the friendliest waitress, the shiniest expanse of neon and tin, he seems to have covered every inch of the Northeast, from Pennsylvania, where he works as a photographer for The Philadelphia Inquirer, all the way up to the Maine border. As his first book, HOMETOWN DINERS (Abrams, $29.95), demonstrates, Williams has very particular standards. The building itself is crucial. (It helps to have a pedigree from one of the classic manufacturers like Silk City or O'Mahony.) Size counts too, though not in the usual way. (''My take on what makes a hometown diner would exclude any diner that could seat that whole hometown.'') And then there's the ineffable question of atmosphere; even in this age of political correctness, he's nostalgic for ''the mingled smell of coffee and cigarettes.'' Williams does full justice to the finest diner exteriors, but it's his glimpses of the people inside that ice the cake. True to the spirit of across-the-counter banter, he provides detailed captions to tell their stories: the state representative who doubles as a short-order cook at the Capitol Diner, the amateur Santa who climbs on top of Daddypop's Diner every Christmas, the Cordon Bleu chef with the Super Duper Weenie Truck, the folks at the Deerhead Diner in Queens who look as if ''they've just answered a call for a Scorsese movie.'' Williams appreciates the illogic of diners: the Nite Owl is only open from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M.; the garbage at the Melrose is refrigerated. He's judicious on the subject of the great hamburger war between two New Jersey diners and amused by the reactions of the regular patrons at a Massachusetts diner who rebelled every time more ''healthy choices'' appeared on the menu. His own preferences are best suggested by a sign he photographed from the Tick Tock Diner: ''EAT HEAVY.'' Alida Becker",1999-08-01T05:00:00+0000

It is set in a wartime hospital in Milan, and its central characters are the narrator, a young American soldier, and an Italian major. Both have been injured, though not fatally. The right hand of the major, who had been Italy's greatest fencer, has been shriveled to the size of a small child's, while the American, a former football player, has lost his calf entirely and can no longer bend his knee. In the hospital are machines that a doctor assures them will heal their damaged limbs. And so the two men meet every day at the machines, the major teaching the American the subtleties of Italian grammar.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Apocalypse Now,"Laurence Cosse's witty and casually profound new novel, A CORNER OF THE VEIL (Scribner, $23), is about what happens when a hastily scrawled six-page manuscript lands in the mailbox of a French priest named Bertrand Beaulieu. No ordinary letter, this manuscript contains miraculous, irrefutable proof of the existence of God. Those who read it are instantly transformed, and there is hope that the good news will ''lift both human consciousness and human liberty to their highest level.'' Cosse's novel, deftly translated from the French by Linda Asher, takes us on a tumultuous ride through the Machiavellian worlds of modern French theology and political maneuvering. Cosse skillfully reduces the drama to its bare bones; she brings together a group of French Government ministers to represent the various fields of human power and shows us how they react to this startling document. The Finance Minister fears people will have no reason to work and the economy will collapse; the Justice Minister frets about how the absence of evil will affect the legal system; the Foreign Minister foresees international upheaval as other religions denounce Christian fanaticism and the denial of their own theologies. The Prime Minister, who has read the letter, is more interested in roses and his much-neglected wife, certain ''a world of harmony is about to come into being.'' While the politicians haggle, Beaulieu and his fellow priests try to decide how to handle the document, how best to spread the message while at the same time keeping it under wraps until the perfect moment. That the conflict is resolved by a deus ex machina is only fitting; the irony of a greater -- but not the greatest -- agent's intervention is a spectacular capstone for this fin de si cle romp in the fields of the Lord.

It also provides public infrastructure to residential developments in ever more remote exurbias. In a ''free market,'' equally informed consumers make choices among a number of options.

Many comment on the abundance of wildlife, among them, in 1829, John James Audubon, who should know. And wild life: Stephen Crane in 1892 describes an ''observation wheel'' in Asbury Park ''filled with maniacs.''

Though its World War I story unfolds among French and British soldiers and their German captors at prison camps, ''Grand Illusion'' is extraordinary in refracting the battles raging outside through the apparent civility of the prisoners.

But few novels in any genre are as lucid, or as memorably spooky, as Jerome Gold's new book, SERGEANT DICKINSON (Soho, $20); it belongs on the high, narrow shelf of first-rate fiction about battlefield experience. The novel's laconic narrator is Ray Dickinson, a radioman with a Special Forces unit in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. His camp is encircled by the North Vietnamese Army, and a full-scale assault is expected any day. What little information Dickinson can glean about the war, or about his unit's hope for reinforcements, arrives over his radio, and much of what he pulls in sounds like madness. (''Plei Mrong reports seeing an elephant bombed and strafed by six sorties of American aircraft, wants to know what that was about.'') All around him, Dickinson sees madness, too: some American ground troops, for example, have begun to shoot at their own planes -- they're that envious of ''men who could just fly away from it all.'' Gold, who served in Vietnam as a Special Forces sergeant, writes spare and elegant prose that belies the brutality and the claustrophia he evokes here. His slim novel is a carefully chosen assortment of details and impressions; he expertly dismantles the myth -- dear to civilians as well as to soldiers -- that if you do everything right no harm will come to you.''

''We lost about 10 acres of corn in a spot that we couldn't irrigate, and we lost about two acres of pumpkins in another,'' Mrs. Carville said.

us,Sharper Images,"The daguerreotype, a photographic image made on a small, highly polished silvered copper plate, was the first popular form of photography. The process was invented, patented and disseminated in Europe and exported to the United States in 1839. Before long Americans improved the new technology by eliminating the need for the deadeningly long exposure times, and daguerreotype portrait studios spread and prospered across the country. AMERICA AND THE DAGUERREOTYPE (University of Iowa, paper, $37.95), a generously illustrated collection of essays, portrays photography as both the reflection and the builder of 19th-century America's self-image. The book focuses for the most part on portraiture, starting with an essay by its editor, John Wood, on the power of the face to inspire and captivate. Wood, a professor of English at McNeese State University in Louisiana, argues strongly for the importance of daguerreotype art and ascribes great potency, sexual and esthetic, to this fragile and miniature photographic form. Two hundred handsome reproductions, 28 in color, show images not often seen in daguerreotypes -- cats, cattle, sleeping children, gold miners, towns, landscapes and even a scalp photographed in St. Paul. Nudes, still lifes and landscapes by contemporary artists are also included. Daguerreotype photography, reputed to have produced some 30 million images in the United States between 1840 and 1860, became obsolete as soon as photography advanced to the point where multiple images could be made. Wood would argue that this is America's loss. Rosemary Ranck",1999-08-08T05:00:00+0000

That means the winners have fast fingers -- but mainly they own a computerized speed dialer programmed to provide the right information in the right order. To foil the speed dialers, the county is following other public systems in upgrading its reservations software: starting Oct. 1, callers will get a time randomly distributed within a three-hour period, rather than first call, first served. The county is also considering requiring dialers to provide the Social Security numbers of all members of their golfing groups, to keep each player in a foursome calling to see who gets the best time.

She was a designer in an architectural office, designed fabrics for a textile company and worked at CBS in her early career designing advertisements for the network. Later, as an art director, she designed album covers and liner notes for CBS records for everything from pop to classical. Ms. White won many awards for her work from AIGA, The Art Directors' Club of New York and had her work shown in Graphis magazine. Her later career experience was in pharmaceutical advertising. She began as an art director at William Douglas McAdams Inc., and included career moves to L.W. Frolich Intercon., Levey/ Wolff/Swift and Grey. She rose to the position of Vice President, Art Group Supervisor, supervising four art directors. She designed and organized campaigns for the introduction of new pharmaceutical products. She was a pioneer in her profession, blazing the way for younger women in the field of advertising. She retired from full time advertising in 1988 and went into business as a dealer in French and English antiques at Le Vieux Monde Antiques on Lexington Avenue. Ms. White left the antique business in 1990 to devote herself full time to painting, her first love. Early along in this pursuit she had shows at Katarina Rich Perlow Gallery, and most recently showed her work at the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton. Ms. White became involved in philanthropy in 1992 through her interest in establishing a place for young artists to develop their work. She was in Vermont painting and met John Gregg and was enamored with the idea of building and expanding his vision of a retreat for artists at all levels in their careers. The concept of a place where artists, poets and writers could work uninterrupted by the everyday demands of family and work appealed to her greatly. She was the Chairman of the Board of the Vermont Studio Center. Ms. White openly acknowledged her battle with breast cancer and decided to dedicate her energies to helping other women in a position similar to her own. Her artistic vision led her to establish an in-patient floor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering that would have a personal and gracious environment. She was involved in the design and decoration of the floor, from choosing carpeting and fabrics to adorning the walls with her own photographs and paintings. She was similarly involved in an out-patient facility for women at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. At the time of her death, Ms. White was on the advisory board of the Sloan Kettering Institute, was a trustee and Board member at the Cooper Union School of Art, a Board member of the Friends of LaGuardia High School (formerly the High School of Music and Art), and a member of the Board of the Parrish Museum in Southampton. Ms. White leaves her sons Neil, Leslie and Daniel, her devoted companion Jack Talan, and her sister Mimi Inorio.

us,"Pony Skin, Now Tamed","Pony skin may be the rage, but some tidier types find the fabric too shaggy and unkempt. This could explain the unexpected popularity of Frederic Fekkai's new pony skin tote, with its neat black-and-white windowpane pattern. ''Conventional pony skin with big black splotches can look messy,'' said Lucy Sykes, the fashion editor of Allure magazine, who owns the Fekkai bag. ''The graphic pattern brings order to the disorder of regular pony skin.'' Part of his fall collection, the $595 bag hit Mr. Fekkai's boutique at 874 Madison Avenue (71st Street) at the end of July. All 35 bags in the original shipment sold out the day they arrived. A second shipment, mostly already sold, is expected this week, and a third is due in late August. Although the tote also comes in chestnut and gray, the crisp black-and-white version is the most sought after (888-333-5524 to order).

It is doubtful that Mr. Furrow would have prospered as a campus recruiter for Aryan Nations. It is also unlikely that he could have done much to further the supremacist movement's growing presence on the Internet, except, of course, as hero and, if convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Joseph Ileto, as martyr. Mr. Furrow embodies the attributes, amounting nearly to stereotype, that have made it all too tempting to regard white supremacy as a fading, peripheral irruption within normal society.",1999-08-15T05:00:00+0000

DANCE FOR A CITY: Fifty Years of the New York City Ballet (Columbia University, $50), alas, is not a comprehensive catalogue but a companion volume containing six essays, transcripts of a group of vivid interviews with George Balanchine conducted by Nancy Reynolds in 1974 and 1975, a complete list of the stage works of Jerome Robbins and, last but not least, some of the black-and-white photos on display in the exhibition (as well as several others not seen there). The illustrations range from a 1952 magazine cover depicting Maria Tallchief's legs to three witty drawings from Edward Gorey's ''Lavender Leotard; Or, Going a Lot to the New York City Ballet.'' Some of the best images in the show are inexplicably omitted -- I especially missed Robbins's harrowing portrait of Tanaquil LeClercq, Balanchine's last wife and the company's greatest and most photogenic ballerina, made not long after polio forced her to retire from the stage in 1956 -- and certain of the essays that take their place, including Jonathan Weinberg's apologia for George Platt Lynes's soft-core porn dance photographs, seem beside the point. But others are first-rate, particularly Charles M. Joseph's ''Making of 'Agon,' '' while the pictures are so good that you may want to buy two copies of ''Dance for a City,'' one for reading and the other for clipping and framing.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Sex and Oxygen,"Sex doesn't equal love -- or does it? If it doesn't, then why do we expend so much energy on merging our bodies with others' while we so rarely connect in spirit? If it does, then why isn't sex enough to bind two people together against the world's insistence on ripping them apart? Such questions are among the chief preoccupations of PRAYERS OF AN ACCIDENTAL NATURE (Coffee House, paper, $13.95), Debra Di Blasi's arresting second book of fiction. Her characters struggle with the dichotomy of body and soul, the clash between the urges of the flesh and the desires of the heart and the inequalities of class, ethnicity, sex and age that magnify these conflicts. In ''An Interview With My Husband,'' an American woman marries a younger man from Argentina. Their lovemaking is perfect, they are in love -- surely this will last a lifetime? A year later, she finds herself on a rooftop, begging him not to leave her. In ''Where All Things Converge,'' an extraordinary beauty gives up sex when it fails to bring her love; the lonely heroine of ''Blind'' recalls a past love even as she realizes that the passing of youth and beauty will now rob her, too, of sex. The pull of the flesh can't be denied: at times, sex may be only a surrogate for love, but it can be as essential to that emotion as oxygen is to life. In clear, resonant prose, laced with bittersweet humor, Di Blasi imparts her understanding of love's multiple ironies. Zofia Smardz",1999-08-15T05:00:00+0000

Yes, he is a best-selling millionaire author who has been deified by Robert Redford and satirized by ''Dick'' on-screen, but even millionaire authors sometimes must cry all the way to the bank. With each passing year, Woodward gets less respect. The reviews of his books have become more dismissive, with this summer's best seller, ''Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,'' even coming in for harsh criticism on the op-ed page of his own newspaper, The Washington Post. Woodward's previous book, an account of the Dole-Clinton race titled ''The Choice,'' was deconstructed by Joan Didion as ''political pornography'' in The New York Review of Books. Other critics routinely argue that while Woodward's facts almost always hold up, they are spun and slanted by his sources or distorted by you-are-there re-creations of ''actual'' dialogue that is as human as the audioanimatronic Presidents at Disney World. Woodward's most hyped recent revelations -- Hillary Clinton communing with Eleanor Roosevelt, Bill Clinton's anguish over his daughter reading the Starr report -- are hardly smoking guns to rival those with which he and Carl Bernstein nailed Richard Nixon back in the heady era of ''All the President's Men'' a quarter-century ago.",1999-08-15T05:00:00+0000

Bond in 1915, it might not be so shabby a souvenir. Long a staple of blue-collar closets in Australia, Bond's T-shirts, which are often stocked by hardware stores next to the latex paint, have been adopted by New York's high-style circles. ''The fit is so sexy and the cotton is so beefy,'' said the designer John Bartlett, who discovered the shirt, which he called the ultimate white T-shirt, last fall on a trip Down Under. ''I ended up buying five in every color. Now I order them in bulk over the phone and have a drawer devoted to them.'' They will be easier to get later this month, when Barneys New York brings Bond's T-shirts to American shores, along with their cartoon spokesman, Chesty Bond, an Australian icon on a par with Mr. Clean or the Fruit of the Loom guys. Barneys is to stock Bond's A-frames, crews and V-necks for both men and women, at $15 to $20 each. Mr. Bartlett isn't thrilled. ''They were my little secret,'' he said, ''until now.''

Joan began her committment to philanthropy in 1974 with a volunteer position behind the Information Desk at the American Museum of Natural History. She became one of the Museum's most devoted advocates. Working at the museum, she recognized problems she could help address for both the public and the staff. Her gifts to the Museum helped to fund foreign language floor maps, new drinking fountains, office equipment, and air conditioning units. In 1997, she made a gift to fund the Hayden Edition Zeiss Universarium MKIX projector for the Space Theater in the new Hayden Planetarium, which will open in the Spring of 2000. In recognition of her quarter century of dedicated volunteer service to the Museum and her generous support of so many important museum projects, Joan was inducted as a Trustee in 1997. Up until the last year of her life, she continued to work behind the Museum's Information Desks, dispensing maps and greeting visitors. In addition to the Museum of Natural History, Joan also generously supported the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Guiding Eyes for the Blind, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the American Foundation for the Blind, and the Red Cross.

In 1965 he joined WPIX as Chairman of the Board. Innovations for which he will be remembered include the Christmas Eve ''Yule Log'' telecast, WPIX multi awardwinning editorials and the impact of his single slide that said ''Shame'' that appeared on the screen for several hours after the death of Robert Kennedy.

The space may be only 200 square feet, but since opening his sky-blue door a few weeks ago, he has already drawn models as customers, among them James King, Kiara Kubakuru and Leilani Bishop. That's in part because Mr. Steinberg is a celebrity downtown, known for emceeing karaoke night at the Elbow Room on Wednesdays and for performing in bars around town as Johnny Fayva, an over-the-hill lounge singer. The quirkier the better for Mr. Steinberg, whose shop window reads ''Steinberg & Sons, since 1999,'' even though he is a bachelor and has yet to produce an heir. The items range from Diane Von Furstenberg halter-top wraps ($115) to lesser-known designs, like Yu Jeans' sparkly pastel camisoles ($130) and a bandana print skirt ($150) by his girlfriend, Tatiana Von Furstenberg, from her Bait 'n' Tackle line. The best-seller so far is an Olga Kapustina cocktail dress with frayed sleeves ($200). ''The sleeves on most of Olga's pieces are roughly cut,'' he said recently, while Ione Skye tried the dress on. ''So some people might think, 'Hey, it's not finished.' But the models understand that it's a look.'' BILL POWERS",1999-08-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Books In Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Sainthood Is Out of Reach,"In Susan Dodd's new book, O CARELESS LOVE: Stories and a Novella (Morrow, $22), love sometimes fails the characters but it always reigns supreme among their preoccupations. ''So Far You Can't Imagine'' is a graceful, glancing investigation of E. M. Forster's maxim, ''Only connect!'' Set in Boston, the story illuminates the obscure threads of fear, loneliness and longing that link strangers together as a man named Schachter, a successful banker, searches for someone who can help him feel more human. In ''Lady Chatterley's Root Canal,'' as in several of the other stories, we see a character at a moment of spiritual crisis that occurs in the most mundane of circumstances -- here, a series of visits to the dentist. In ''Ethiopia,'' a novella, a woman named Nola becomes as ascetic as the saint she is writing about, only to discover that holiness is ''an inhuman thing.'' Her platonic but highly charged friendship with Marcus, a novelist and academic, finally teaches her about her capacity to breathe life into her literary creations and to take the risks that intimate relationships require. At times, the territory of these stories feels too superficially explored; a novel might have allowed Dodd's vivid, wisecracking characters the stretching room they need. One of the stories, ''Lokey Man,'' contains the most breathtaking courtship scene I've ever read. Another, ''What I Remember Now,'' is about the ways in which people don't connect -- and the failure of love to mend wounded lives. The moral of all these stories could be: ''Love would, but simply cannot, conquer all.'' Barbara Quick",1999-08-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books In Brief: Nonfiction; High Life, Grim Work","''In a painting that's even worth looking at, the image must be twisted if it is to make a renewed assault upon the nervous system,'' Francis Bacon (1909-92) once quipped, hinting at the core of his brutal, visceral, distorted portraits of man and beast and shrieking popes. His friend and biographer Michael Peppiatt and two art historians, Dennis Farr and Sally Yard, build a revelatory composite portrait in FRANCIS BACON: A Retrospective (Abrams/ Trust for Museum Exhibitions, $65). Yard's cogent essay gives essential biographical information: Bacon was thrown out of his home at the age of 16 by his father after being caught in his mother's underwear, and thereafter moved peripatetically among the homosexual underworlds in Berlin, Paris and London, where he finally settled. He was a notorious high liver and an atheist who found in subjects like the Crucifixion a way to convey man's butchery. Farr points out that Bacon, who was assigned to clear corpses from bombed houses during World War II, had plenty of ready-made examples for his Crucifixion studies. He also underscores how fiercely Bacon controlled his images, destroying any he thought unsatisfactory and forbidding written commentary on specific paintings (Farr provides such analysis here, with each color plate). In rousingly animated prose, Peppiatt recounts how Bacon was able ''to transmute paralyzing amounts of drink into creative energy,'' rising at 6 each morning to grapple with his canvases while his companions (including Peppiatt) were incapacitated. And while Bacon excoriated religion, Peppiatt trenchantly observes his near-religious fervor about painting, belying nihilistic statements Bacon was prone to make like: ''I have nothing to express.''

The bloody mess had started to send shivers up my spine when I glanced a bit ahead and saw another one. It was equally eviscerated and motionless. Abruptly, the shivers stopped and my suspicions rose. I knew that two dead squirrels within a short stretch of road could mean only one thing -- more woodland in the area was being clear-cut. Determined to find it, I looked quickly to my right. It was still somewhat hidden behind a shallow line of trees, but I was able to see the freshly turned dirt and piles of downed trees.

Mr. White and his partner, Dr. Rich Bailey, an Illinois dentist, also make Deliverance Teeth and in the spring signed with New Line Cinema to market Austin Powers Teeth. At the premiere party for ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the actor-director Ed Burns wore a pair to kiss Heather Graham, his girlfriend, who stars in the film. Absent from the endorsement list, however, is Billy Bob Thornton.

us,Allegro City,"New York served as a songwriters' muse long before Billy Strayhorn advised us to take the ''A'' train or Rodgers and Hart told us they'll take Manhattan. In NEW YORK: Songs of the City (Billboard/Watson-Guptill, $35), Nancy Groce, an ethnomusicologist, has collated almost 1,000 songs about New York spanning three centuries. The city has had its poets laureate for every era: the 19th-century musical comedy-writing duo of Harrigan and Hart; George M. Cohan, ''The Man Who Owns Broadway,'' at the turn of the century; the Gershwin brothers; Cole Porter; Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who oriented us during the World War II years with ''New York, New York.'' The book is chockablock with historical information, rare songs and lyrics, but is confusingly organized geographically and thematically, rather than chronologically, so that Billy Joel is lumped in with Depression-era songs. The text is often plodding (''New York City has always been a unique place''), but the illustrations provide a visual feast of sheet music covers and tinted postcards that evoke the lost world of Schrafft's, Childs and Horn & Hardart. Although the book attempts to be comprehensive, music from the latter half of this century is treated cursorily.

It happened again last February in Los Angeles, at the Grammy Awards. By then both singers had built huge Spanish-speaking audiences and were looking to invade the Anglo market. Anthony's star was ascendant; Martin was, at best, a shadowy blip on the pop-culture radar. But it was Martin who was invited to perform that night, and he did so with such pansexual verve that the world was left panting for more. He also took home a Grammy.

us,A Butterfly on the Floor,"Rahna Reiko Rizzuto's first novel, WHY SHE LEFT US (HarperCollins, $24), is broad in scope, yet its greatest pleasures are small ones. Rizzuto follows three generations of a Japanese-American family, deftly counterbalancing the dramas of World War II (the American internment camps, specifically) and of home life (most crucially, the relinquishment of a child born out of wedlock). The book's structure is equally ambitious: the story is told by four different narrators in several time periods, jumping between past and present tense and third and first person. This method can be intriguing; reading the book is akin to assembling a jigsaw puzzle as the picture gradually emerges. But the multiple voices render the narrative choppy, at odds with the simple, lyrical beauty of the language itself: words ''dropped individually, like stones into dust,'' lips ''arched like a bird's wings,'' a bellicose brother turning on his heel ''left the form of a butterfly in the dirt on the floor.'' A subtly persistent longing for security pervades all the characters and is most poignantly present in Eric, the boy who was given up for adoption and then reclaimed by his grandmother, but never by his mother. Two scenes are rendered all the more moving, and significant, by being parallel -- in 1925, a little girl watches her mother give birth; 17 years later, she bears her own daughter as her mother looks on. The real news in ''Why She Left Us'' resides in the intimate moments. Sarah Saffian",1999-08-29T05:00:00+0000

(Trish), R.N., Ph.D., FAAN, age 50, Senior Vice President, Patient Services, Leukemia Society of America, an internationally recognized leader in oncology nursing, died peacefully on August 27, 1999, at her home in Stamford, CT, after a valiant struggle with cancer. Born in Gainesville, FL, on December 26, 1948, she was the daughter of Joel Greene and the late Marion Hodges Greene. Dr. Greene received her BSN and MSN from the University of Florida. Her doctorate was awarded by Georgia State University. She was the first Robbie Simpson Fellow at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, an honor that enabled her to promote advanced nursing roles in pediatric oncology throughout the country. She was a founder of Cancer Practice, the American Cancer Society's (ACS) first multidisciplinary practice journal and an original co-editor of Oncology Nursing Update. She authored 32 publications and lectured widely in the United States and abroad. Her contributions were recognized by her election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing. Dr. Greene's clinical career emphasized the care of children with cancer. She held advanced practice clinical positions at Shands Teaching Hospital in Gainesville, FL, Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill, and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. She was a founding member and the first president of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses. Her leadership guided the formation of pediatric oncology nursing as a specialty. In 1981, Dr. Greene became the ACS's National Nursing Consultant. She left the ACS in 1996 with the title of National Vice President, Patient Services. During her time at the ACS she developed critically important scholarships and professorships for oncology nurses and scholarships for oncology social workers. This program enabled hundreds of nurses and social workers to pursue graduate studies. She had a key role in bringing programs such as Look Good, Feel Better and I Can Cope to national distribution. She guided national and international revisions of Reach to Recovery, the ACS's program of support for women with breast cancer. She worked with Lane W. Adams, then the Chief Executive Officer of the ACS, in creating a program of national awards recognizing excellence in clinical practice and caring. In 1996, Dr. Greene joined the Leukemia Society of America (LSA). She developed the LSA's Patient Services Program at the national level and throughout the LSA chapters. She created the school re-entry program, began First Connections, and established the LSA's National Information Resource Center. Volunteer work was an important value in Dr. Greene's life. She served the Oncology Nursing Society in several key roles. Her work with the State Cancer Pain Initiatives was pivotal in the establishment and dissemination of that program throughout the United States. She chaired the International Union for Cancer Control Nursing Education Project and was involved in bringing educational programs on cancer nursing to five developing countries. Dr. Greene received many awards including an honorary Lane W. Adams Award, and Distinguished Service awards from the Oncology Nursing Society, the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses and the Association of State Cancer Pain Initiatives. She was selected as a Distinguished Alumna during the University of Florida's School of Nursing 50th Anniversary Celebration. Besides her father of North Carolina, Dr. Greene is survived by her companion of 14 years, David Lingren of New York City, two sisters, Terry Cox of Athens, GA and Janet Bailey of Greensboro, NC. A memorial service will be held at a later date. There will be a private interment service in Florida.
