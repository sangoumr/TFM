Innovations during her tenure as Chief Nursing Officer included the development of a nursing research program, the launching of team nursing, the founding of the East Harlem Nursing Council, and a restructuring of the School's curriculum.

Clinton's ""My Life"" is holding at No. 10 in its 26th week; Carter's ""Sharing Good Times,"" which made its first appearance here last week, is at No. 8. As writers go, these men are pretty different. In his memoir, Clinton took a Norman Mailer-like swing for the bleacher seats. Carter, on the other hand, has been mostly content to crack out singles and doubles in his literary career, and he has even dropped the occasional bunt. (His book of poems, ""Always a Reckoning,"" had a six-week run here in 1995.) In the process, Carter has become the Joyce Carol Oates of American ex-presidents. He has published no fewer than 19 books, 17 of them since he left office, and more than half have made the Times list. ""Sharing Good Times"" is a fairly unassuming piece of work. It puts forward the not-exactly-controversial thesis that ""experiences are more deep and lasting sources of pleasure when they are shared with others."" What gives ""Sharing Good Times"" friction and depth is Carter's sometimes bracing understanding of his own flaws. (""True sharing of my personal life with others has not come naturally to me,"" he admits.) One thing Carter does not like to share, at least with his wife, Rosalynn, is the editing process. The couple once wrote a book together, he says, and while her edits of his work were ""drastic,"" she considered her own sections ""to have the same status as the Ten Commandments brought down by Moses from Mount Sinai."" Rosalynn Carter may know what she is doing.

He was 55 and a resident of Huntleigh, MO. Mr. Bergmann was an experienced venture capitalist and investment professional. In 1992, he co-founded Advantage Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity firm focused on raising investment capital for entrepreneurs in states and communities historically underserved by venture capital. Mr. Bergmann's tireless work through Advantage contributed dramatically to the growth of many entrepreneurial businesses and the creation of thousands of jobs at these firms. Reflecting his keen interest in small business capital formation, in 1995 he served as a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business. In 1998, Mr. Bergmann was presented an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for being a supporter of entrepreneurship. In 1999, he received a Financial Services Advocate award from the U.S. Small Business Administration. In addition to enjoying his family and his Welsh Springer Spaniels, Mr. Bergmann was active in the St. Louis community, giving his time and energy to the Old Newsboys Charities and other organizations. Born and raised in St. Louis, Mr. Bergmann attended Northwestern University in Evanston, IL., and Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned an MBA degree. Mr. Bergmann began his professional career with the investment firm of Halsey, Stuart & Co. in Dallas in the 1970s and subsequently joined the local office of Drexel Burnham Lambert. While in Texas he married the former Peggy Timmons in 1979 and four years later they moved to Los Angeles, where Mr. Bergmann joined Drexel's High-Yield Securities Department. In 1991, Mr. Bergmann returned to St. Louis and soon afterward partnered with Steven T. Stull to found Advantage. In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Katherine A. Bergmann, and a son, John D. Bergmann, both of the home; a sister, Susan Bergmann Calhoun of St. Louis, MO, and a brother, J. Stephen Bergmann, and his wife, Nancy, of Jamestown, R.I.

Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia on May 2, 1925 he was the son of Dr. Oskar and Marketa Glaser, both of whom perished in the concentration camps. Miles survived three brutal years in the camps and upon being liberated in May 1945 returned to Prague. When the Communists came to power in 1948, he was smuggled across the border into Austria and resided in Vienna before immigrating to the United States in 1949. Miles held various jobs in Chicago and New York City before moving to Houston in 1954 as the representative of a foreign owned steel exporter. He became an American citizen in 1955, and for the next twenty years continued as an executive in the steel business, eventually becoming the owner of Global Steel. It was during this time that he met John de Menil and his wife Dominique, from which grew a life long friendship. He was invited to become a member of the Menil Foundation Board and served as the Chief Financial Officer of the Menil Foundation until his retirement in the late 1990s. He remains the Emeritus member of the board. Miles is survived by his wife, Slavka, to whom he was married for ten years. She and his friends will remember him as an extraordinary man, filled with a passion for life and an unwavering belief in the rights of each individual. He suffered no fools and defended fiercely the principles of loyalty, ethics, and freedom. He did not bend to the particular winds of the day, but steered his own course with humor and wisdom.

Many of her essays were meditations of a sort, in which she brooded over something -- the nature of camp, say, or the seductive power of photography -- and then worked out her own thoughts and feelings. In the end, they were almost the same thing. Her ideas were deeply felt, her feelings deepened by reflection. She was by nature a fusionist -- someone who could link high art and low, Patti Smith and Nietzsche -- and a distruster of false or easy connections, like our way of using metaphor to talk about sickness.

With these credentials, at the age of 15, the determined ""slip of a girl"" convinced the Minister of Education to allow her admission to the Royal College of Medicine in Baghdad, as the first and only Jewish female student. She completed her MD, traveled widely in the region with her colleagues, and practiced medicine in Baghdad. In approximately 1946, Semha traveled to England and Scotland pursuing post-graduate training, and in 1948 accepted an invitation to sail on the Queen Mary to the USA. In New York, she was introduced to the fledgling Iraqi Jewish community, and met and married George Nathaniel, also of Baghdad. They became US citizens, raised three children and remained together until George's death in January of this year.

He was 82. Dr Greene was a professor of anesthesiology at Yale University School of Medicine and on the staff of Yale-New Haven Medical Center for 32 years. Founder of the Department of Anesthesiology at Yale, Dr. Greene was its chairman and Director of the Department of Anesthesiology at Yale Medical Center for 18 years. He was honored in 2002 by the establishment of the Nicholas M. Greene Professorship of Anesthesiology, an endowed chair. Dr. Greene served 26 years as editor and editor-in-chief of ""Anesthesiology"" and ""Anesthesia and Analgesia,"" the two major journals in the specialty in North America. Dr. Greene wrote several books and over 200 articles reflecting his interests in education and physiologic changes associated with anesthesia, especially those produced by regional and local anesthesia, an interest formed while a fellow at the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1950. He also was a member of surgical and pharmacological advisory committees at the National Institute of Research in Bethesda, Maryland, in the 1960s and 1970s. Dr. Greene served as president of the Association of University Anesthesiologists and the New England Societies of Anesthesiology. A member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the Connecticut Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Society of Regional Anesthesiologists, and the International Anesthesia Research Society, Dr. Greene was awarded several medals for his contributions to anesthesiology, including Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeon's silver medal on the occasion of its bicentennial, as well as medals from the Swedish Society of Anesthetists and the Koller gold medal from the European Society of Regional Anesthesia. He was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree by Yale University and honorary Fellowship in the English Royal College of Anaesthetists.

Greene and Nanine Pond Greene Pervere, Dr. Greene was born July 11 in Milford, Connecticut in 1922. Dr. Greene graduated from Yale College in 1944 and received his medical degree from Columbia University in 1946. After serving as a surgical house officer at Presbyterian Hospital in New York City and as a medical officer in the U.S. Navy, he became a resident in anesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, later becoming a member of the staff of that hospital as well as faculty of Harvard Medical School. From Boston, Dr. Greene went to the University of Rochester School of Medicine where he served as a chairman of its Department of Anesthesiology before moving to New Haven in 1955. Dr. Greene was a member of the New Haven Lawn Club, the Yale Club of New York City, Christ Church parish in New Haven, Elihu, and the Ladies Aid at Yale.

And why haven't I got one? A look at ""Nixon"" shows that producer inflation isn't just a matter of massaging executive egos. The makers of the film (which stars Sean Penn as the would-be assassin Sam Bicke) used their producer credits -- including glossy Hollywood names like Alfonso Cuarn, Alexander Payne and Leonardo DiCaprio -- as thank-you notes, as book-jacket-like endorsements and even (in Mr. Cuarn's case) to identify the actual producer.

This was never really effective, but to understand how truly futile it is these days for the upper classes to try keeping the masses in their sartorial place, you need to know what a chav is. ""Chav"" -- the champion buzzword of 2004 in Britain, according to one language maven there -- refers to something between a subculture and a social class. Experts disagree about the slang term's origins, but the unofficial definition sounds rather condescending or even cruel: a clueless suburbanite with appalling taste and a tendency toward track suits and loud jewelry. Still, as with ""redneck"" in America, a term that is imposed as a marker of scorn can be embraced as a marker of pride; at the very least, a certain humor and irony lace many of the discussions about chavs on Web sites and in books like ""Chav!

They are always on. One is tuned to Al Arabiya itself, and depending on where the cameras are placed, Al-Rashed sometimes catches a glimpse of himself, pacing around his desk on his cellphone. Another shows Al Jazeera, the channel's main competition. A third is tuned to a new Saudi government satellite channel, and a fourth displays CNN. Al-Rashed likes to flip around on the other two -- from Al Hurra, the widely ignored news channel that the United States government started last February, to the BBC and then to Al Manar, the Hezbollah-owned station that was banned by the French and American governments last month for broadcasting anti-Semitic slanders and what a State Department spokesman called ''incitement to violence.''

The man, David Banach of Parsippany, was shining a new laser pointer about 5:30 p.m. Friday, said his lawyer, Gina Mendola Longarzo. Mr. Banach returned home on Saturday after his questioning, but the laser pointer was seized, Ms. Longarzo said. The police inside the helicopter were investigating reports that a laser beam had been shined on a small passenger plane as it flew over Parsippany on Wednesday, the day after federal officials announced that they would investigate reports of lasers being shined into the cockpits of airplanes as they were about to land. No one has been hurt, but federal officials have said that laser beams can temporarily blind pilots. Patrick O'Gilfoil Healy (NYT)",2005-01-03T05:00:00+0000

A longtime Greenwich resident, died December 29 at the Nathaniel Witherell Nursing Home in Greenwich, CT. He died of complications of Alzheimer's disease, according to his wife of 44 years, Judy Finneran of Stamford. Jerry was born February 16, 1937 in New York City to John Finneran and Dorothy Buckley Finneran, both of whom are deceased. He grew up in Larchmont, NY, and graduated from Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, NY in 1955. He then became part of the first graduating class from the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, graduating in 1959. Subsequently, the Air Force sent him to the University of Michigan Graduate School of Business. After leaving the Air Force, Jerry took additional graduate courses at the N.Y.U. School of Business and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard University School of Business. While in the Air Force, Jerry was stationed in Germany and Greece until his retirement in 1965 as a Captain. He joined Citibank's European Division in 1965 and was sent to London in 1966. He was then put in charge of opening and managing Citibank's subsidiary in Jersey, Channel Islands. In 1973, he returned to New York to set up and run Citibank's Latin American Investment Bank, which included investment banking offices in the major latin american countries. In 1983, he assumed responsibility for the North American Investment Bank for Citibank.

In 1990, Trust Company of the West acquired the fund, changing the name to TCW America's Development Association, LP. In 1991, the charter of the fund was changed to encompass emerging markets debt and equity worldwide, and he also assumed responsibility for the co-management of the Argentine Investment Company, a private equity fund. In recent years, he volunteered with the South Forty Corporation, a non-profit organization that assists newly-released convicts in finding employment and reestablishing their lives. Jerry was involved in sports all of his life, lettering in football, baseball, basketball and diving in high school, and received sports scholarships to over 15 colleges. He was also the first person to receive the Con Edison Sportsman of the Week Award in two sports, football and diving. At the Air Force Academy, he was a quarterback for the football team and a member of the diving and baseball teams. As a member of the Millbrook Club for over 31 years, he enjoyed golf, tennis and paddle tennis.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: TiVo Introduces Mobile System,"TiVo, the box that has become synonymous with digital recording of television programs, now has a mobile companion, the TiVoToGo service, for more restless viewers. The service, announced yesterday, allows subscribers to transfer programs to laptops as long as copyright protections are in place. TiVo, the maker of the digital video recorder, is now promoting a no-cost automatic software update to its stand-alone Series 2 devices, except those belonging to subscribers with DVD recorders. The company plans to get TiVoToGo to DVD recorder subscribers later this year. But subscribers will not be able to watch just any show on their laptops. TiVo has designed the service to shun content that uses Macrovision copy protection technology, including pay-per-view and video-on-demand programming and commercial DVD's. To transfer television programs onto a laptop, a subscriber must install the TiVo Desktop software on the portable computer. The system encrypts the program during the transfer, so subscribers must use a password to decrypt and play back the show.",2005-01-04T05:00:00+0000

The last 30 minutes of an exciting Rose Bowl, below, followed by the entire Fiesta Bowl, filled ABC's prime-time hours and drew an average of 14.71 million viewers, according to the Nielsen overnight ratings.

On Sunday, ABC's made-for-television movie ""Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure"" flopped, and the network placed third behind CBS and NBC, which tied for first place. CBS was given a boost by an extended National Football League game and a strong performance by ""60 Minutes."" And without ABC's ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Boston Legal"" as competition, NBC was able to win both 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., as the crime shows ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" and ""Crossing Jordan"" were No. 1 in total viewers and among the 18-to-49 audience.

In its early stages, corporate online booking was all about saving a few dollars on each fare, with little regard to the traveler's control. Now, because of better technology, that situation is changing, says David A. Falter, the president for corporate travel solutions for the Cendant Corporation. ""We think 2005 will show a rapid expansion for online booking in the corporate space,"" Mr. Falter said yesterday. Many business travelers complain that online corporate travel systems severely limit their choices on the road, but Mr. Falter said technology was advancing to go beyond ""commoditization"" air fares. ""The next generation in travel through online services is going to be, 'how do I give the traveler the self-serve opportunity throughout the travel experience' -- self-service with regard to changing travel plans"" using personal digital assistants and other devices while traveling. ""Online booking has changed the nature of how travel is started, but it has not changed the nature of how travel is conducted,"" he said.

The trade minister, Luiz Fernando Furlan, said the country finished the year with a trade surplus of $33.7 billion, up 36 percent from a surplus of $24.8 billion in 2003. Exports and imports both climbed to all-time highs last year, with foreign sales surging 32 percent, to $96.48 billion, far beyond forecasts. Imports rose 30 percent, to $62.78 billion, as Brazil's economy, which is South America's largest, grew at its fastest pace in a decade.

The woman, T.J. Myers, was in ""Seduction of Innocence,"" which was rated R for nudity and sex scenes but is sold in an unrated version. Ms. Myers has her own Web site on which she invited visitors to see her on the Fox program. The 90-minute reality special, in which Ms. Myers, who had been given up for adoption, correctly identified her biological father and won a $100,000 prize, drew relatively few viewers, despite heavy promotion and wide press coverage. Only 6.34 million people tuned in for the show, putting Fox in fourth place in the evening's Nielsen ratings competition. This wasn't the first time a contestant on a Fox reality show has turned out to have an interesting real life. Sarah Kozer, a finalist on Fox's ""Joe Millionaire"" in 2003, starred in bondage and fetish films, and Rick Rockwell of Fox's 2000 ""Who Wants to Marry a Multi-millionaire?"" had once been under a restraining order issued by a California judge after his ex-fiance said he had assaulted and threatened her. The series premiere of NBC's mystery program ""Medium,"" starring Patricia Arquette, above, was a success, attracting an audience of 16.13 million. The big numbers for ""Medium"" caused ""CSI: Miami,"" also in the 10 p.m. slot, to post its lowest ratings for a new episode this season, though it still had the most viewers that evening, with 18.17 million, and anchored a first-place finish for the night for CBS. In the late-night race, Craig Ferguson had a disappointing showing for his debut as the host of ""The Late Late Show"" on CBS.

Augusto Pinochet, is competent to stand trial on charges of murder and kidnapping stemming from his role in Operation Condor, a joint campaign set up by South America's right-wing military dictatorships in the 1970's. In 2001, General Pinochet, 89, was charged in connection with another case of human rights abuses but escaped a trial when his lawyers maintained he was mentally and physically unfit and the Supreme Court upheld that argument after doctors determined he was suffering from what they called ""mild dementia,"" or senility.

Last year the European embassies began inviting opponents of the government of Fidel Castro to their diplomatic cocktail parties, and Cuba cut off relations with them. Spain, which has extensive investments in Cuba, worked to broker a truce between Mr. Castro and European leaders. President Castro released 14 of the 75 jailed dissidents, and a European Union panel recommended this month that the practice of inviting dissidents to parties be dropped in favor of more discreet contacts.

The 55-19 Trojan victory in this season's college football title game drew an average of 22.1 million viewers over the night. NBC came in second among the also-rans on the strength of a special episode of ""Dateline"" at 10 p.m., which featured an interview with Amber Frey, an ex-girlfriend of Scott Peterson, who was convicted of murdering his wife and her fetus. Its audience of 15.9 million made that ""Dateline"" the most-watched episode of the newsmagazine in nearly two years. And the series premiere of NBC's sitcom ""Committed,"" which was in the slot usually occupied by ""Scrubs,"" performed much better than that hospital comedy has this season.

Informer,"A federal judge dismissed a $120 million suit against the F.B.I. by two former owners of a South Boston liquor store who said a gangster and informer, James Bulger, had extorted the business with the knowledge of his handler at the bureau. The plaintiffs, Stephen Rakes and his former wife, Julie Dammers, said they were forced to sell the store at gunpoint in 1984 to Mr. Bulger, who turned it into his gang's headquarters. The owners said a former agent in the bureau, John J. Connolly Jr., had been aware of the extortion but was more concerned with protecting Mr. Bulger. Chief Judge William G. Young of Federal District Court in Boston said he dismissed the suit because the claim was not made until 2001, two years after the bureau's troubled relationship with Mr. Bulger became public.

The Rockefeller University community mourns with deep sadness the loss of our beloved colleague and friend, Maclyn McCarty, an eminent physician - scientist who served the university with enormous distinction for sixtythree years. A member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, and recipient of the 1994 Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science, Dr. McCarty was a microbiologist best known for his seminal contributions to DNA research. In the 1940's, in association with Oswald Avery and Colin MacLeod, Dr. McCarty determined that genes are made of DNA, a landmark discovery that opened the gateway to the modern era of molecular biology and molecular medicine. From 1946 to 1981, as head of the Laboratory of Bacteriology and Immunology, he pioneered investigations of streptococcal infections and their complications including rheumatic fever. In 1960, he accepted appointment as physician-in-chief of The Rockefeller Hospital and for fourteen years fostered clinical research and clinical care on our campus. From 1965 to 1978, he also served the university as vice president. Dr. McCarty held one of the university's John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Professorships. Throughout his distinguished career, he was a forceful and articulate spokesperson for the importance of patient-based research and the need for medically trained investigators in biomedical inquiry. With uncommon insight and dedication, he was an exemplary model for many generations of investigators. His greatness as a scientist was matched by a wonderful humanity. A warm, wise and caring friend to many, he will be profoundly missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved Marj, a cherished member of our community, and to his sons and daughter.

At Luxor on Wednesday, researchers removed the king's mummy from its tomb and placed it in a CT scan for the first three-dimensional images of its skull and other bones. When simpler X-rays were taken 36 years ago, bone fragments were detected inside Tut's skull. This prompted speculation that the pharaoh, who died at 17, had been murdered, probably by a blow to the head. Other evidence pointed to death by illness. Dr. Zahi Hawass, Egypt's chief archaeologist, said that results of the CT scan would be announced later his month in Cairo. John Noble Wilford (NYT)",2005-01-07T05:00:00+0000

One is the all-female, Butoh-inspired SENNICHIMAE Blue Sky Dance Club. Based in Osaka and three years old, the troupe performs at shrines, schools and other alternative spaces. Here, in ""Natsu no Utsuwa"" (""Container of Summer""), it will portray the living welcoming deceased ancestors for several days before sending them home again. The second is BATIK, above, which will be seen in its American debut. Founded in 2002 by Ikuyo Kuroda, a member of the Kim Otoh + The Glorious Future company, BATIK will perform ""Shoku"" (""Touch""), a dance that promises a raw portrayal of the frustration and fury unique to Japanese adult women.

Seven Vietnamese have survived the infection during that time, including a 16-year-old girl reported ill last month who remains in critical condition. The three new cases were in southern provinces, where the disease has infected thousands of birds. A common risk factor in those cases has not been found, and international health officials have raised concern because they occurred at the start of cooler weather, when the more common human influenza strains usually strike. Epidemiologists have for months expressed fears that avian and human strains could swap genes to create a new influenza virus that could rapidly spread through the world. Lawrence K.

The snow is feather-light, the skies are turquoise, and the closest Wal-Mart is 65 miles away. With a series of elevator-shaft steeps spilling down the front side of the mountain, it has long been known as an expert's playground. In 2002, the resort's image was softened with the 733-acre expansion into Prospect Bowl, which added a dose of intermediate and beginner terrain. But thrill seekers continue to get their adrenaline fix. This season Telluride is offering guided hike-to skiing down Mountain Quail, an 1,100-foot chute below the imposing crags of Palmyra Peak. When you're not turning knee cartilage to Jell-O on the igloo-size bumps of Kant-Mak-M, you can cruise the 19th-century gold-mining town of Telluride. A free gondola links the historic town with the newer Mountain Village at 9,540 feet. Pushing the development of luxury hotels and multimillion-dollar log cabins uphill has enabled the town to remain relatively unchanged since miners came here to drink, gamble and liquidate their $3-a-day paychecks in Popcorn Alley, the red-light district, named for the continuous opening and closing of doors.

There, on the occasion of the Met's lavish survey of natural and man-made booty accumulated by successive electors of Saxony, Georg Laue, a dealer and amber expert from Munich, has mounted a dense display of more than 100 small, exquisite wunderkammer objects dating from the 16th to the 19th century. The show feels like a somewhat oppressive living room, thanks to the intimate size of the gallery and the relative absence of Plexiglas and the use of small exquisitely crafted cabinets for some displays. Nearly everything on view is a kind of marvel, usually one that combines an exotic and beautiful natural material with a triumph of human skill. This applies to several chalices and tankards and one small monument carved from serpentine or rock crystal, a silver-mounted emu egg and a small box made of blocks of amber, as well as a beautiful Asmat ancestor skull, decorated with seeds, feathers and shell; three bronzes of tiny lizards cast from life; and a model boat from the Spice Islands (Indonesia) made entirely of dried cloves. Also arresting are several tiny carved ivories of double-sided heads in which living faces alternate in different ways with vermin-infested skulls. These objects, one of which is a cane handle, above, manifest a theme that haunts the wunderkammer: vanitas, or the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death, against which all collecting is an unusually materialistic form of resistance.

us,The Listings; GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS/TV ON THE RADIO,"Through countless samples and imitations, hip-hop has made George Clinton's riffs familiar again, but great bass lines are only the beginning when he leads his P-Funk All-Stars. It's a big, motley band; through the years, it has been costumed in everything from glitter to denim to diapers. Under Mr. Clinton's watchful direction, the band treats funk as long, molten jams, preaching subversion through pleasure and togetherness without uniformity. In the course of a set, he's likely to get to hits like ""Atomic Dog"" and ""Flash Light,"" but Mr. Clinton's funk is both manifesto and musical marvel. It keeps up with hip-hop, but Mr. Clinton, above, has been making music since his Parliaments were a doo-wop group in the 1950's, and P-Funk's vamps take in gospel and be-bop, salsa and soul, doo-wop and heavy metal. Tight and loose at the same time, Mr. Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars insist by example that sweaty, unpredictable humanity is more fun than any machine. TV on the Radio puts its own history of rock -- especially New York rock -- into a pressure cooker of speed-strummed tremolo guitars and implacable mechanical drumbeats. Its songs incorporate noise-guitar squalls, droney Minimalism and something like a cappella doo-wop, while its vocals stay high and gentle, almost wistful. On its album, ""Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes"" (Touch and Go) -- one of the best albums released in 2004 -- the lyrics contemplate desolation and fear, collapsed romance and crumbling dreams: in ""Ambulance,"" the band sings, ""I will be your one more time if you will be my one last chance."" Frenzy and stasis combine in songs that make introspection an adventure. (Tonight at 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets are $20 to $45.) JON PARELES",2005-01-07T05:00:00+0000

He also propagated poplar trees for environmental remediation and at the time of his death, was exploring the medical uses of hops. Born in NY and raised in Great Neck, he attended Westtown School in Westtown, PA and Bard College in Annandale, NY.

""We thought it was an interesting way to cast an incredibly broad net,"" said Jeanne Lutfy, president of the BAM Local Development Corporation, which issued the request for expressions of interest. The proposals, due Feb. 7, will be evaluated by the BAM L.D.C., the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. The development corporation is seeking ideas for the north part of the district, a 60,000-square-foot area. The Theater for a New Audience and the Brooklyn Public Library for the Visual and Performing Arts are to be on the south portion. The district's intent is to convert vacant parking lots and other underused property into affordable, desirable space for a variety of arts groups. The district is also to include arts education activities, mixed-income housing, restaurants, stores, underground parking and open public space.

Domestic sales rose 10.5 percent in 2004, to 1.58 million vehicles, benefiting from a drop in interest rates early in the year and a flurry of year-end sales. In December alone, sales in Brazil shot up 28 percent, to 178,000 vehicles, even though automakers scaled back production by 8 percent from November, to 185,200 units. Exports, meanwhile, soared 51.8 percent last year, to $8.3 billion, surpassing forecasts by more than 10 percent. For 2005, the auto industry is forecasting a more modest increase in output, 5.4 percent, to 2.3 million vehicles, as Brazil's economy begins to cool. Todd Benson (NYT)",2005-01-08T05:00:00+0000

In ""Big Brother,"" four men and four women share a specially designed house; they have no contact with the outside world until viewers vote them out after fellow housemates nominate them for dismissal. This edition of the show, which began Thursday, consists of highlights from the 24-hour-a-day filming of the group, who are required to perform challenging tasks, like running a physically demanding obstacle course. Ms. Greer, 65, above, is competing against actors, soap opera and pop stars, a model and broadcasters, the youngest being Kenzie, a 19-year-old member of the band Blazin' Squad. Ms. Greer, who admits that she is bossy -- ""I'm supposed to be terrifying"" -- said, ""I've got to strike a blow for the old ladies."" The last celebrity housemate standing will receive a prize of about $93,500, to be donated to a charity of his or her choice. Contestants are charged about a dollar for each vote for eviction; a portion of that sum also goes to charity. PAM KENT",2005-01-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"THE NEOCON NOVEL: The best book-related feature in any of this planet's English-language newspapers is surely ""The Digested Read,"" which appears in The Guardian of London. The premise of ""The Digested Read"" is pretty straightforward. Each week, The Guardian asks a writer to regurgitate the contents of a newly published book in 500 words or so, preferably in the style of its author. A few weeks ago, Michael Crichton's new novel, ""State of Fear,"" was fed through The Guardian's microcompressor, and the results were predictably hilarious. (One bit of dialogue went like this: "" 'Give me Morton's money,' yelled Drake. 'I can't,' replied Peter. 'His estate is in probate.' "") ""State of Fear"" seeks to debunk climatologists' dire predictions about global warming, and the book includes appendixes, a hefty bibliography and an author's note that bolster the book's arguments. The Guardian had even more fun with this material, capturing Crichton's tone this way: ""I'm very, very clever and have read a lot and you're all stupid wishy-washy liberals."" Is Crichton's book, as Steve Wasserman has claimed in The Los Angeles Times, ""the first neocon novel""? Seems unlikely. Either way, ""State of Fear"" has certainly not been hurt by the controversy it has generated. The book is No. 3 on this week's hardcover fiction list. On ABC's ""20/20,"" Crichton had to dodge John Stossel's attempts to kick up even more dust. ""What's with the four wives?"" Stossel asked the frequently divorced writer. To which Crichton replied: ""Where I come from, in Hollywood, four wives is sort of like the average. . . . I'm halfway to Mickey Rooney.""",2005-01-09T05:00:00+0000

He is survived by his wife of fifty years, Esther Shava; daughters, Ruth, Beth (son-inlaw Scott Fithian), Jane (partner, Lynette Jackson), and Naomi; grandchildren, Sam and Sarah; sisters Sylvia Breeders and Mimi Cooper. Alan was President and CEO of Saxon Paint & Hardware, which was founded by his paternal grandmother in 1914. He developed the company to a 50-store chain across three states and in 1996 he sold off and closed the company. Alan and Saxon became known for pioneering the concept of the ""do it yourself trend"" in wallpaper, paint and home furnishings. He was a co-founder of the Business Executives Movement Against the War in Vietnam in the 60s. Their activism against the war earned Alan and Esther the distinction of being on Nixon's Enemies list. In the early 1970's he was a founding member of BPI (Business and Professional People for the Public Interest) and a past president and board member up until his death. He spent approximately 20 years on the board of Columbia College of Chicago, and served on the boards of the ACLU and most recently on the board of JCUA (Jewish Council on Urban Affairs). Alan grew up on the near west side of the city and always felt passionately about Chicago. As a child, he shared with his father a love and fascination with the diverse neighborhoods of the city. Consequently, as an astute businessperson and a social activist, he believed in the diversity, ethnicity and vitality of the city. He was committed to the communities beyond being a local retailer and participated in neighborhood-based initiatives, local public schools and chambers of commerce. At a time when there was rapid urban flight, he opened stores in neighborhoods which were being abandoned by the national chains, food stores, and banks. All of these neighborhood stores remained open until 1996. Alan was a lover of nature, jazz and a world traveler with his wife. He spent many weekends and holidays with his family at their beach house in the Indiana Dunes hiking, sailing, biking, swimming, and horseback riding. He was also an avid skier since 1965. His great energy, humor, generosity, enthusiasm for life and tenacity will be remembered and missed by many people. Please call Goldman Funeral Group at 847-478-1600 for information regarding visitation. Per his request, there will be a party to celebrate the life of Alan Saks scheduled in the near future, date and time to be announced. Call Goldman Funeral Group for information after January 10, 2005. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution in Alan's name to one of the three following organizations: 1.

It is entirely lost, for good reason, on Alice Glendenning, a 34-year-old widow who has been having a hard time of it since her husband was lost at sea eight months earlier in a boating accident. The insurance company is hedging on paying out on the double-indemnity policy, and although Alice has found a job with a real estate firm, she has yet to make her first sale.

If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively support their efforts."" Neither Palestinian nationalism nor Palestinian suffering any longer justified the political enfranchisement of the Palestinians. Instead the Palestinian question was folded tidily into the Bush administration's catechism about democracy, which it has raised into the solution to all of the world's significant problems. Tyranny, terrorism, poverty, disease: the administration's answer to all these evils is elections. About the moral and political superiority of democracy, and about the disqualification of terrorists from politics and diplomacy, the president was correct; but there was something doctrinal, even magical, about his formula.

Wise's ""Though the Heavens May Fall"" and Adam Hochschild's ""Bury the Chains."" For Robinson, whose fiction and essays revive the classic 19th-century themes of conscience, duty and moral awakening, abolitionism is a compelling subject. As she recalled in an e-mail message: ""About 20 years ago, a minister who knew I was interested in American literature gave me an old book, 'The Lives and Deeds of Our Self-Made Men,' by Harriet Beecher Stowe,"" which told dramatic stories about early heroes of the antislavery crusade. ""Over the years I read what I could find,"" she explained, ""and put together a web of interacting people and settlements. I wanted to look at a reform movement that actually took root."" Her research animated her novel ""Gilead,"" one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2004, and informs her belief, stated in her review, that slavery was met with indifference by many ""in a world where the appropriation of lives and the extortion of labor were astonishingly commonplace.""

Breast milk helps disarm salmonella and E. coli. Its unique recipe of fatty acids boosts brain growth and results in babies with higher I.Q.'s than their formula-slurping counterparts. Nursing babies suffer from fewer infections, hospitalizations and cases of sudden infant death syndrome. For the mother, too, breast-feeding and its delicate plumbing of hormones afford protection against breast and ovarian cancers and stress.

A graduate of Hunter College High School, Wesleyan University, and Columbia Law School, Laurie began as a litigator at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. She then turned her attention to the public sector, where she spent the remainder of her career dedicated to serving the people of New York. In positions with the Attorney General's Office, the NYC Human Resources Administration, the NYC Comptroller's Office, and as counsel to the Governor's Office under Mario Cuomo, Laurie's work affected everything from campaign finance legislation to welfare reform, the state budget to charities fraud. Laurie's contribution as an activist in the gay and lesbian community was, if possible, even more profound. She was a founder and board member of the Empire State Pride Agenda, and was instrumental in their work to pass both the Hate Crimes Bill and the Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Act. She also served as a Director of the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York, and was, until her death, Vice President of the Stonewall Community Foundation's Board of Directors. The vast legion of people who counted her as their very good friend will miss her, and they would agree: her enormous love of life was surpassed only by her generosity of spirit.

Laurie is survived by her brother Robert, her longtime companion, Murphy, and a host of beloved friends. Laurie was a native--and devoted--New Yorker. A graduate of Hunter College High School, Wesleyan University, and Columbia Law School, Laurie began as a litigator at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. She then turned her attention to the public sector, where she spent the remainder of her career dedicated to serving the people of New York. In positions with the Attorney General's Office, the NYC Human Resources Administration, the NYC Comptroller's Office, and as counsel to the Governor's Office under Mario Cuomo, Laurie's work affected everything from campaign finance legislation to welfare reform, the state budget to charities fraud. Laurie's contribution as an activist in the gay and lesbian community was, if possible, even more profound. She was a founder and board member of the Empire State Pride Agenda, and was instrumental in their work to pass both the Hate Crimes Bill and the Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Act. She also served as a Director of the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York, and was, until her death, Vice President of the Stonewall Community Foundation's Board of Directors. The vast legion of people who counted her as their very good friend will miss her, and they would agree: her enormous love of life was surpassed only by her generosity of spirit. A memorial service will be held Wednesday, January 12, at 9:30am at ""The Riverside,"" 76 St & Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, Laurie wished donations to be made to the Stonewall Community Foundation.",2005-01-12T05:00:00+0000

In 1942 he joined the RCA laboratory facility in Princeton where he worked until retirement in 1981. His first assignment, in collaboration with Dr. Albert Rose and Dr. Harold Law, was to develop a new type of television camera tube called the ""Image Orthicon"". This tube, which proved to be 100 times more sensitive than its predecessors, was used for the first 20 years of television broadcasting in the United States. Dr. Weimer was made a Fellow of the Institute for Radio Engineers in 1955 and was later awarded the IRE Television Prize for his work on camera tubes based on photoconductivity. In 1963 he received an individual RCA David Sarnoff Outstanding Achievement Award in Science for his work leading to extended applications for evaporated thin films. His leadership in the development of the thin-film transistor (TFT), and its use in integrated circuits led to his receiving the 1966 IEEE Morris N. Liebman Memorial Award. Other honors included election to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1981, and the 1986 ""Kultur Preis"" award of the German Photographic Society for his early work on solidstate television cameras. While working at RCA, Dr. Weimer was granted over 90 U.S. patents. In 1991 he shared with Dr. Albert Rose (then deceased) a Pioneer Award by the New Jersey Inventors Congress and Hall of Fame. Dr. Weimer was born in Wabash, IA. He received a B.A. in math and physics from Manchester College (1936), an M.A. in physics from the University of Kansas (1938) and a PhD in physics from Ohio State University (1942).

CBS, which broadcast a night of repeats, had the most households; NBC had the most total viewers and won the 18-to-49 demographic; Fox lost the 18-to-49 by a hair and was a close third in total viewers. These numbers represent improved outlooks for Fox and NBC, both of which spent the fall season flailing. In NBC's case, the Monday turnaround can be pinpointed to the network's new psychic friend: ""Medium,"" starring Patricia Arquette, above. An audience of 16.29 million watched the supernatural mystery's second episode, making it the night's biggest draw. Fox's prime time hours were devoted to another two-hour episode of ""24,"" which attracted a smaller audience than the splashy premiere the previous night: 12.57 million against 14.85 million.

Beloved husband for 57 years of Anne Gibson Clark Washburn, and loving father of Constance Clark Washburn of Lagunitas, CA, and Lynn Washburn Hanke of New York. He leaves five grandchildren: Andrew and William Castle and Leigh, Randall and David Hanke. Mr. Washburn was born in Reading, PA in 1914. During the Depression, he worked his way through New York University (Class of 1936). During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945 on patrol in the North Atlantic with experimental subchasers and later in command of the Destroyer Escort USS Vammen, which saw combat in the Okinawa invasion. Managing men, arms and supplies prepared him for the responsible leadership he would later demonstrate during a forty-plusyear career as a pioneer of the mutual fund industry. He managed the first mutual fund department on Wall Street at Kidder Peabody from 1949 to 1953. By 1961 he formed the Sales Training Institute to prepare a fast-growing sales force, and served as the first President of the National Mutual Fund Managers Association in 1967. He was a partner at Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis from 1963 to 1971, and later with Loeb Rhodes & Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette he continued to advance the development and marketing of mutual funds. From postwar years in Forest Hills where he joined the West Side Tennis Club to The Maidstone Club in East Hampton and The Bath & Tennis in Palm Beach, Mr. Washburn was a fixture on the tennis court and the dance floor. A lifetime of skiing, skating, sailing, golf and ocean swimming made him a tireless ballroom dancing partner. He also had a passion for sailboat racing where he often served as both cook and navigator on Bermuda races. A gracious gentleman who could never be found without his warm smile and engaging sense of humor, George Washburn will be missed by all who knew him.

us,'THE LEOPARD',"Luchino Visconti's 1963 masterpiece ""The Leopard"" opens in 1860, soon after Garibaldi has landed in Sicily and a year before Victor Emanuel II has been crowned the first king of a unified Italy. Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, played with magnificent grandeur by Burt Lancaster (alas, badly dubbed), reigns over a house teeming with relatives and servants, all of whom tremble in his wake. At once disturbed by change and existentially resigned to it, the Prince is facing his future as stoically as one of the age-beaten marble statues in his garden. Lancaster based his character on Visconti, a Marxist from an aristocratic family who had a sensuous appreciation for the glories of the un-unified Italy, evident here in the mansion's frescoed ceilings and the lace curtains billowing with winds of change. Visconti had an eye for sumptuous detail, but his triumph in ""The Leopard"" was how he tapped into the human core of this political story. It is the Prince's nephew, Tancredi (Alain Delon, above, with Claudia Cardinale as his love interest), who delivers the film's famous line, a crushingly cynical observation about power: if we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change. The Prince helps save Tancredi -- and, by extension, the decadent breed to which they both belong -- but does nothing to save himself, which makes him not just the subject of ""The Leopard"" but also its hero. The film will be shown at Film Forum in the restored version, complete with inadequate subtitles. (Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8110, through Jan. 20.

In her case, that presence is big, strong, warm and colorful; and it's coupled with an artistry flexible enough to take her, it seems, just about anywhere she wants to go. In the last 12 months, New York has heard her in Handel's ""Rodelinda"" at the Met; in Meyerbeer and Berlioz with the New York Festival of Song, and in Wagner, Strauss and Mahler on her latest album. For her next trick -- a recital at Alice Tully Hall -- she's offering something completely different: three songs by Frank Bridge and Ralph Vaughan Williams's ""Songs of Travel,"" coupled with seven melodies by Faur and ""Songs Parodying Advertisements"" by the irreverent musical polymath Nicolas Slonimsky.

On Wednesday, in response to a request by The Detroit Free Press, a federal judge in Detroit released the six pages of medical information. Gregory Reed, the lawyer who filed two lawsuits on Ms. Parks's behalf contending that members of the music industry had used her name in a song without permission, said her medical records should not affect the two related lawsuits, filed in 1999 and 2004. The suits, which named Ms. Parks as the plaintiff, accused the rap group OutKast, BMG and several record companies and music distributors of defamation.

The figures from Jalisco have a dynamically human presence, like the male dancer standing with his right leg crossed over the left, head cocked, one hand to mouth, the other at his hip, clad in the briefest of garments. Those from Nayarit seem more stolid, like the ""Standing Female Figure,"" above, with vertical stripes painted on the lower half of her face, who holds up a cup in her right hand, her miniskirt half concealing a pair of thick legs firmly planted on two flat feet. From Colima come more stylized figures with large noses and animal imagery, like a well-armored turtle in the form of a vessel from whose upper shell a large spout emerges. The collection, a promised gift to the museum by the Andrall E. Pearson family, will give welcome exposure to a little-known ancient American art.

Pretax profit in the year ending in March will exceed 100 million ($189 million), beating an earlier prediction, the chief financial officer, Roger W. Taylor, said in an interview. In the 13 weeks to Dec. 25, the company connected 23 percent more people and increased retail sales 25 percent from a year earlier.

When ""Naked Boys Singing!"" opened at the Actors Playhouse in Greenwich Village in July 1999, the reviews were affable enough but hardly high praise. Yet five and a half years later, the show is still around (it moved uptown in March) and going strong. Once every gay man in New York had seen it, apparently, the so-called bachelorette parties started arriving. Productions are also running in Chicago and Atlanta, and a 39-city European tour is to begin in March. ""Naked Boys Singing!"" is just what the title suggests: a lineup of good-looking, young men nude most of the time -- doing musical numbers, lots of them slightly naughty and largely forgettable. But between the songs about masturbation, unwelcome erections and pornography, the show sometimes reveals a soul. Its finest musical moment is Mark Winkler and Shelly Markham's ""Mitchum,"" a tribute to one young man's favorite 1950's movie star, ""a perfect 10 back in the days of real men."" With the accompaniment of life-size dancing Mitchum cutouts, Frank Galgano (fully clothed) laments the era of bottled-water-drinking boys with perfect gym bodies and longs for the days when guys came in all shapes and sizes, smoked and drank gin. ""I know he was a little beefy and soft,"" Mr. Galgano sings (Tom Gualtieri originated the number in New York). ""But when he took it all off . . . "" One likes to think that Mitchum, who died in 1997, would, rather than rolling over in his grave, just raise a brow and narrow those bedroom eyes, suggesting that hey, he might try anything once.

us,World Business Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Annual Inflation Within Target Range,"Inflation in Brazil was within the central bank's target range last year for the first time since 2000. The government's statistics agency said its consumer price index, the central bank's main gauge in setting interest rates, rose 7.6 percent in 2004, compared with a 9.3 percent increase in 2003. While that was higher than the central bank's target of 5.5 percent, it fell within a 2.5 percentage point tolerance band that allowed for an inflation rate of up to 8 percent. Though inflation eased on an annual basis, it accelerated in December for the third consecutive month, with a larger-than-expected rate of 0.86 percent. The central bank is expected to raise its benchmark lending rate next week for a fifth consecutive month to curb the increase in monthly inflation. Todd Benson (NYT)",2005-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Soon after beginning his term in 1999, the Republican-controlled Legislature adopted a retention policy as part of an education overhaul that also created a voucher program. But loopholes, it turned out, allowed the vast majority of failing students to be promoted anyway. Lawmakers added teeth to the policy in 2002, and 14 percent of the state's third graders -- about 27,000 -- were retained the following year, a much higher number than under the earlier policy. Of those, about 30 percent -- 8,300 -- failed the reading portion of the state test for a second time and many are repeating the grade yet again this year (exact figures are not available).",2005-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Beloved husband for 57 years of Anne Gibson Clark Washburn, and loving father of Constance Clark Washburn of Lagunitas, CA, and Lynn Washburn Hanke of New York. He leaves five grandchildren: Andrew and William Castle and Leigh, Randall and David Hanke. Mr. Washburn was born in Reading, PA in 1914. During the Depression, he worked his way through New York University (Class of 1936). During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945 on patrol in the North Atlantic with experimental subchasers and later in command of the Destroyer Escort USS Vammen, which saw combat in the Okinawa invasion. Managing men, arms and supplies prepared him for the responsible leadership he would later demonstrate during a forty-plusyear career as a pioneer of the mutual fund industry. He managed the first mutual fund department on Wall Street at Kidder Peabody from 1949 to 1953. By 1961 he formed the Sales Training Institute to prepare a fast-growing sales force, and served as the first President of the National Mutual Fund Managers Association in 1967. He was a partner at Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis from 1963 to 1971, and later with Loeb Rhodes & Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette he continued to advance the development and marketing of mutual funds. From postwar years in Forest Hills where he joined the West Side Tennis Club to The Maidstone Club in East Hampton and The Bath & Tennis in Palm Beach, Mr. Washburn was a fixture on the tennis court and the dance floor. A lifetime of skiing, skating, sailing, golf and ocean swimming made him a tireless ballroom dancing partner. He also had a passion for sailboat racing where he often served as both cook and navigator on Bermuda races. A gracious gentleman who could never be found without his warm smile and engaging sense of humor, George Washburn will be missed by all who knew him.

The directors of the Partnership for New York City, concerned about relying on century-old infrastructure for getting their employees to work, decided late last year that the proposed tunnel should be a priority for government financing, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the partnership. Before that, Ms. Wylde said, the city's business leaders were not convinced that New York needed another hole in the ground. But after hearing from officials of New Jersey Transit as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the partnership changed its priorities for 2005, saying that the tunnel is as critical to the economy of New York as a new transit hub downtown and an extension of the No.7 subway to the Far West Side.

Legal secretaries need 7 of 10 job skills at a particular minimum level: a 5 in listening (scale 1 to 5), in observation (scale 3 to 6) and in reading and math (both 3 to 7). They also need a 3 in applied technology and in teamwork (both 3 to 6) and a 4 in writing (1 to 5).

Mr. Hartog was born in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, on December 18, 1910. He married Ada Menko in 1937, and they had five children, of whom four are surviving. Mr. Hartog served in the Dutch Army in World War II, and then fled the Nazi occupation with his wife and child. He served the balance of the war in Surinam as an Army artillery officer. He and Ada immigrated to the United States in 1948 and settled in Westchester County, where Joseph resided for the next 56 years. He lived in Scarsdale for 54 of those years. His wife Ada died in 1965, and Joseph subsequently married Lotte Smith; they were married for 32 years until her death in 1998. Joseph was an entrepeneur and successful small businessman until his retirement. He was a hard bargainer who believed that ethical business practices inevitably led to professional success. Joseph was a member of the Community Unitarian Church at White Plains for nearly 55 years. He served as an officer of the congregation in numerous capacities for multiple terms. He helped build the present facility, and participated in the employment of more than one clergy member. He was a man of diverse interests, with a keen curiosity and a continual desire to expand the breadth of his knowledge and experience. Of all the aspects of his life his family was the most important. He was a patriarch in the best sense of the word, standing at the ready for his children and grandchildren, nephews and nieces, as the need arose.

us,How Did He Become the Government's Favorite Architect?,"Ariving through Los Angeles, pointing out the large public buildings he has designed, Thom Mayne is getting glummer and glummer. On the outskirts of town is the acclaimed Diamond Ranch High School, a succession of angular shapes clad in corrugated metal, marching dynamically up a steep ravine. Down in tough South Central lies the Science Center School, which combines a lofty renovation of a historic armory with a tilted bar of a new building that sinks to the ground and is protected from the street by a planted berm. Not far away, at the corner of First and Main in the heart of downtown, sits the powerful, brooding Caltrans District 7 building, a headquarters of the California transportation department; it is a collaboration with the artist Keith Sonnier, whose embedded fluorescent tubes evoke car taillights caught in a long-exposure photograph. Sharp-edged and off-kilter, wrapped in corrugated or perforated metal, these three high-profile projects were all completed in Mayne's home city in the last few years. So why is the architect looking so unhappy? ""It seems like a moment in time when I am getting architecture out of projects, and I can't be complaining,"" he says unconvincingly. Then he immediately adds, ""If I wasn't actually dissatisfied, I wouldn't be me."" A little while later, he is still musing: ""It's what it could have been, in your own brain. I don't know why it's so painful. Maybe it's something that's not attainable. Maybe I'll know it when I get there.""",2005-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Interment: Arlington National Cemetery. Memorials: Gifts in his honor may be made to The National Space Society, 1620 I Street NW, Suite 615, Washington, DC 20006. Glen P. Wilson was born in Waco, Texas, on December 10, 1922. He lived in Houston until moving to Austin to complete his education at the University of Texas with three degrees: a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering, 1943; MA, 1948 and Ph.D. in Psychology, 1952. He served honorably in the US Navy during World War II. In 1955, he came from Austin, where he had done research and taught at the University of Texas, to work as assistant to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson in Washington, DC. In 1957, as the result of Sputnik, and because of his background as an engineer and scientist, he was transferred to the Armed Services Committee's Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Johnson, and later transferred to the Special Committee on Space and Astronautics, also chaired by Senator Johnson. This is the committee that wrote the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 and created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In 1958, the standing Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences was also created and Glen Wilson was a key staff member of this committee until it was abolished by a Senate reorganization in 1977. He was the only staff person to serve on the committee throughout its entire existence. This committee played a crucial role in supporting NASA's Apollo program and post-Apollo Space Shuttle development. In 1978, he became a member of the senior executive service at NASA, where he developed the Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) for the agency. This innovative program is designed to increase students' interest in mathematics and science by encouraging them to compete by proposing experiments to fly on the Space Shuttle. Since its inception, several million students have used materials developed for this program and more than 20 experiments have actually flown. For this outstanding work, he was awarded NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 1981. He retired from NASA in 1982. In 1982 he also established the Marie D. and Glen P. Wilson Foundation, which served as a supporting organization to the National Space Institute at a crucial time in its development. The Foundation also established and provided financial support for the Space Educator Award, awarded annually by the National Space Club, to an outstanding high school teacher who has had a national winner in the SSIP program. In 1984, he became Executive Director of the National Space Society (formerly Institute), an advocacy organization devoted to promoting research, exploration, development and habitation of space. In 1985-87 he played a key role in the negotiations with the L5 Society which led to the merger of the two organizations in 1978. By the time of his retirement from NSS in 1988, he had more than doubled (to 20,000) the membership of the organization and laid the foundation for its continued growth. Upon his retirement, he was given the title of Executive Director Emeritus and served on the Board of Governors until his death. He received AIAA's Special Presidential Citation and had also been honored by being elected to the International Academy of Astronautics and to the Cosmos Club of Washington, DC. He was selected by the Engineering Foundation Advisory Council as one of five alumni to be honored as a Distinguished Engineering Graduate for 2000 of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He is in numerous Who's Whos, including the 48th and subsequent editions of Who's Who in America. Glen Wilson had more than 45 years of experience in Washington and had been continuously involved in the Nation's space program since its inception in 1957. He was preceded in death by his wife, Marie. He is survived by his brother, Thomas W. Wilson, M.D., and his wife, Jean, and their family.

Because the Newbery is open only to American citizens or residents, one enormously popular writer who isn't in the running is Cornelia Funke, who lives in Germany and whose books appear here in translation. Funke has long been a phenomenon in her native country, where she has published some 40 books; she popped onto the radar screen in the United States in 2002 when her first novel to be issued here, ""The Thief Lord,"" made her, many young readers have said, the closest thing we have to a ""new"" J. K. Rowling. (Funke's latest book, ""Dragon Rider,"" is No. 1 on this week's children's chapter book list, which appears on Page 16 of this issue.) Books in translation by living writers have rarely made it onto The Times's children's list, and Funke's popularity shows no signs of dimming: both ""The Thief Lord"" and ""Inkheart"" are being made into big-budget films. Funke, who is 46, began her career as a children's book illustrator. She began writing her own books, she has said, because she was rarely fond of the stories she was hired to illustrate. Funke -- her name is pronounced FOONK-eh -- may not be at the Newbery ceremony, but she does like to spend time in this country. As she told The Buffalo News, she gets a thrill out of the way American children say her name: ""funky.""",2005-01-16T05:00:00+0000

After Julius Freund's death in 1941, his widow was forced to sell the paintings at auction, the German government said in a statement released last week. The paintings were bought by a special Nazi emissary in 1942 on the direct order of Hitler for his planned Fhrer Museum in Linz, Austria. The recommendation to return the paintings was the first ruling by the mediating commission, which includes the former German president Richard von Weizscker as well as legal and art history experts.

Jackson, below, in the true story of a tough-love high school coach from Richmond, Calif., opened this weekend at No. 1 with an estimated $23.6 million in box-office receipts as of yesterday morning. Released by Paramount Pictures and produced by MTV Films and Tollin/Robbins Productions, the feature is the division's third film to have reached the No. 1 spot at the box office during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend (following ""Save the Last Dance"" in 2001 and ""Varsity Blues"" in 1999). Universal's ""Meet the Fockers,"" in the No. 1 spot for three weeks, was No. 2, with $19 million and a cumulative take of $238.8 million to date, enough to place it in the Top 50 list of all-time blockbusters. Appealing to family audiences was Warner Brothers' ""Racing Stripes,"" a film about a lovable talking zebra that combines live action with computer-generated animation and features the voices of Frankie Muniz, Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg and Snoop Dogg. It took an estimated $14,030,000 in three-day box office receipts to capture the No. 3 spot. Universal landed No. 4 after widening its release of the romantic comedy ""In Good Company,"" starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson, from only three theaters in its third week to 1,566 nationwide, adding $13.9 million worth of tickets (or $8,870 per screen average) to its cumulative take of $14.4 million. The popularity of Jennifer Garner, star of television's ""Alias,"" couldn't quite shake the poor reviews of Fox's comic-book adaptation ""Elektra"" (a spinoff from the 2003 ""Daredevil,"" with Ben Affleck), about a female assassin who has special powers after she is brought back to life. The film opened this weekend in fifth place with $12.5 million at the box office, nearly tied with last weekend's No. 2, ""White Noise,"" which took in $12.2 million.

Over at the House of Representatives, this steadfast support of a more humane immigration system has made some anti-immigration folks very unhappy.

The judges ruled that because the commander, Col. Vidoje Blagojevic, above, knew the mass murder was being planned and helped transfer the captive men to where they were killed, he was guilty of complicity in genocide, one step short of the full weight of the charge of genocide. His co-defendant, Maj. Dragan Jokic, was found guilty of murder, extermination and persecution and was given a nine-year sentence. The judges said that while he did not take part in the massacre, he sent equipment and men to dig mass graves. Prosecutors had asked for a term of up to 20 years for Mr. Jokic and 32 years for Mr. Blagojevic. Marlise Simons (NYT)",2005-01-18T05:00:00+0000

The move follows a report last week in The New York Times that Entercom Communications Corporation, the station's corporate parent, had fired WKSE's program director amid an internal inquiry into whether he had improperly accepted travel packages or other gifts directly from record label executives. The former programmer, Dave Universal, has stated that any trips he took with record executives were never based on promises to play songs on the air.

""The 62nd Annual Golden Globe Awards"" put NBC in third place in Nielsen's overnight ratings both in the total number of households and among 18-to-49-year-olds. Anchored by a football spillover into primetime, CBS was No. 1 over all on Sunday, but ABC posted stronger numbers in the younger demographic that advertisers covet. In Saturday's ratings game, Fox's broadcast of the Atlanta Falcons' lopsided victory over the St. Louis Rams won easily. NBC's network showing of ""Tsunami Aid"" (its cable channels also broadcast this charity show) came in fourth. And on an unusually competitive Friday night, the CBS lineup -- ""Joan of Arcadia,"" ""JAG"" and a repeat of ""CSI: Miami"" -- prevailed in households. But the 18-to-49 demographic preferred ABC's two-hour block of sitcoms, followed by Barbara Walters's return to ""20/20"" to interview President Bush and Laura Bush -- and to spend a large part of the hour walking with, and talking about, the Bushes' dogs.

The researchers ran computer simulations of the earth's climate and water cycles with and without increasing levels of smokestack and tailpipe emissions linked to rising temperatures. Only simulations that included man-made greenhouse gases generated rising Arctic river flows similar to those actually measured since the 1960's, said the researchers, from the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research. Their findings, described in the next issue of Geophysical Research Letters, are significant because freshening of Arctic waters in millenniums past has sometimes caused abrupt changes in climate around the Northern Hemisphere.

In April 1999, scientists fixed tiny locaters to the albatrosses in a cohort breeding on Bird Island, near South Georgia. The data retrieved -- a map of the migratory patterns of 22 birds -- will help scientists understand where albatrosses are most likely to cross paths with fishing boats, which often hook and kill the birds with baited hooks floating just under the water's surface.

In trying to treat his death as virtually a state secret, China's current leaders reveal more than they intend about their own profound feelings of political insecurity. Powerful as they are, China's rulers have let themselves be spooked by a ghost, even to the point of defying the tradition of granting full official funeral honors to ranking former leaders, regardless of ideological differences. It may be possible to airbrush Mr. Zhao temporarily out of official Communist iconography. In the long term, China's people will surely reclaim a more honest history.",2005-01-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings; ASHLIE ATKINSON,"In one of the many poignant moments in ""Fat Pig,"" the unpoignantly titled new play by Neil LaBute, Ashlie Atkinson stands before an imaginary mirror, trying on a series of wraps as she prepares for a day at the beach. Since Ms. Atkinson, and the character she plays, are -- euphemism alert! -- plus-size, the moment could be played for maximum pathos. Refreshingly, it isn't. In Ms. Atkinson's scrutinizing look can be seen everyday doubts and dissatisfactions, maybe a mild grimace at a shape-hiding muumuu, but nothing like shame or fear or despair. The moment beautifully encapsulates the character's clear-eyed, hard-won approach to her life. She has reckoned long with the diminishments and insults that overweight people have to endure, accepted the possibility of compromise but retained a sustaining belief that good things may still be in store. (Guess she doesn't know who wrote the play.) Ms. Atkinson's entirely winning performance has itself not diminished a jot in its appeal since she has acquired a new partner. Steven Pasquale has joined the cast of this Off Broadway hit, replacing Jeremy Piven, off to HBO's ""Entourage."" No worries: Mr. Pasquale is both brashly funny and affecting as a young man struggling to keep a clammy grip on the courage of his convictions.

us,The Listings; 'ARNESON AND THE OBJECT',"Robert Arneson (1930-1992) was the most adventurously ambitious ceramic sculptor of modern times. The father of California Funk was not the only artist to give clay a bigger-than-pedestal-scale life; Peter Voulkos and Viola Frey did, too. But no one brought to clay the range of imagery, themes and purposes that Arneson did, from the surrealistically personal to the ferociously political. ""Arneson and the Object,"" an exhibition organized by the Palmer Museum of Art at Pennsylvania State University, might sound as if it would sample only a narrow slice of his oeuvre, but it is a measure of his dauntless imagination that while focusing on things like shoes, flowerpots and household appliances, Arneson could explore a wondrous variety of conceptual and expressive concerns. The show includes a misshapen sixpack of green, gold-capped Coca-Cola bottles; a lustrously glazed bathroom scale with footprints and five disembodied toes pressed into its surface; bronze bookends commemorating the death of Jackson Pollock; and a portable television filled by the head of Ronald Reagan. The most striking piece is the ceramic sculpture of a pair of bulbous, pink shoes (above), each over a yard long. The sole of one shoe bears the inscription, ""Hommage to Philip Guston 1913-1980."" The reference is, of course, to the darkly comical shoes that frequently piled up in Guston's late paintings and to the visceral pink color he favored. Arneson's poignantly affectionate funerary monument asks in effect, ""Who could ever fill these shoes?"" (George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665, through Feb. 26.)

The conductor and new music champion Joel Sachs seeks to remedy this with help from his New Juilliard Ensemble. Juilliard's annual Focus Festival will be exclusively devoted to the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers. Tonight's opening concert will feature New York or American premieres by Valentin Silvestrov, Giya Kancheli and Alfred Schnittke, above, as well as ""Pro et Contra,"" an early and raw cello concerto by Arvo Prt that predates his shift toward a more prayerful and serene style. The festival continues with five other concerts through next Friday, featuring works by by Tigran Mansurian, Sofia Gubaidulina, Peteris Vasks, Oleg Felzer, Vladimir Tarnopolsky, Valentin Bibik and many others. (The conductor has admirably stocked his programs with plenty of works from the non-Russian Soviet Republics.) On Tuesday night, a panel will discuss the music and its historical context. One can't help but wonder, for example, whether it was in spite of -- or because of -- the conditions of their daily reality and artistic life, that these composers created music of such expressivity and depth. Or was it some ever-shifting combination of both? (Tonight at 8, Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406.

In conjunction with the New York Film Critic's Circle, the Museum is playing host to a continuing series called ""Breaking Boundaries."" Future screenings will include such beloved exercises in cinematic transgression as ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Belle de Jour."" Tomorrow, though, Nathan Lee, the fearless chief film critic of The New York Sun, will introduce Pier Paolo Pasolini's uncompromising ""Salo"" (1975), which brings the visions of the Marquis de Sade into Mussolini's Italy, and reveals the deep, unsettling connections between libertinism and fascism.

Moscow is flooded with glossy magazines about fashion and luxury goods, but there had been nothing to meet the needs of upper-middle-class intellectuals bored by musty Soviet-era literary journals. The demise of Novy Ochevidets, whose title translates as New Eyewitness, was predicted by many media critics, who said it was doomed to publish at a loss and found the contents too staid and derivative.

Enron, which is selling its assets to repay creditors, estimates that employees will ultimately receive about $16.8 million in bonuses. The company, which is based in Houston, will cease to exist once the asset sales are finished. Judge Arthur Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court in New York authorized the payments after the company said it needed to give employees an incentive to stay with Enron until the liquidation was complete. Enron estimates proceeds from the remaining asset sales will total $1.1 billion, which would mean employees would receive $16.8 million, Brian Rosen, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said. Judge Gonzalez authorized bonuses of as much as $45 million if the proceeds reach $3 billion or more.",2005-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Born on April 1, 1950, in Rockville Centre, NY, Carley was a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Business School. She began her career at Dillon, Read & Co. and, after brief stints at Harry Winston and Warburg, Paribas, Becker, joined Ruane, Cunniff & Co. in 1983, where she was serving as executive vice president and director of both the firm and The Sequoia Fund upon her retirement in 2002. Carley had been diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2001. Famously generous with her time and energy, Carley sat on the Board of Managers at Swarthmore College, the Overseers Visiting Committee at Harvard Business School and the executive committee of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Most recently, she served on the board and as director of the investment committee of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Ct. Though Carley was a sharp-eyed investment analyst, she always had time to share with younger people in the investment business and at her firm. A number of her former associates have gone on to found their own successful firms and credit Carley's advice, support and friendship as critical to their success. Upon her retirement at the end of 2002, Carley and her husband Andy spent most of their time at their home in Lyme, Ct. Carley's natural creativity came to the fore as she spent much of her time landscaping and planting glorious gardens which surrounded her during her final years. She derived enormous pleasure from the radiance she created after she left the world of finance. Carley was a great beauty with impeccable taste, and a creature of unsurpassed kindness. She was a doting aunt and godmother, her husband Andy's perfect mate, a peerless friend and the best possible sport. She will be deeply missed by a wide circle of friends, former associates, and by her dear family. She is survived by her devoted husband, Andy of Lyme, Ct.; her parents, Richard and Marilyn Cunniff of Lloyd Harbor, NY; sisters, Hilary Cunniff of Pennington, NJ, and Jeanne Foussard of St. Paul, MN; brothers, Richard, Jr. of NYC and Peter of Harrington Park, NJ, and her stepdaughter, Eliza Riley of Mill Valley, Ca. A memorial service will be announced shortly. In lieu of flowers, Carley's family would appreciate contributions to The Carley CunniffPeter S. Dixon, M.D. Foundation, a charitable trust in formation, in memory of Carley. Its principal mission is to further understand the power of the human spirit during health and illness as it relates to the practice of medicine. Contributions may be directed to P.O. Box 800, Essex, Ct. 06426. CUNNIFF--Carley, on January 16, 2005, at home in Lyme, CT, of breast cancer at age 54. Until her retirement in 2002, Carley was Executive Vice President of Ruane, Cunniff & Co., Inc., and a Director of the firm's flagship Sequoia Fund. She joined the firm in 1983 and over the next 19 years worked diligently to make it a better place. All who knew her respected her integrity and judgment and admired her warmth and good will. She was a perceptive and skeptical analyst who proved a wonderful mentor. She was a trusted adviser who spoke to clients with clarity and wisdom about our investment philosophies and results. We were proud to have her as a colleague, but prouder to know her as a friend. We extend our affection and condolences to her family. Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc. CUNNIFF -- Carley Baxter.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   WRISTON, WALTER B.","WRISTON--Walter B. On January 19, 2005 in New York City after an 18 month fight with pancreatic cancer. He was 85. Mr. Wriston was one of the most innovative financiers of our time. Mr. Wriston was born in Middletown, CT, and graduated from Wesleyan University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Following a year's service as a U.S. State Department officer and a four-year tour with the U.S. Army during World War II, Mr. Wriston joined Citibank in 1946. He held numerous positions at Citibank and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp for 17 years before retiring in 1984 after 38 years with the company. Mr. Wriston was a visionary who saw the future of the banking industry and the important role it would play in the global economy. He is credited with jumpstarting the electronic banking revolution with the introduction of the ATM as well as the expansion of Citibank's international franchise. At the time of Mr. Wriston's retirement, Citibank had bcome the world's largest bank with branches in 79 countries and its investment in computers and software surpassing $1.75 billion. An outspoken advocate on the need for the deregulation of the banking industry and the free flow of capital, Mr. Wriston was also a powerful voice in Washington and was named chairman of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board in 1982. Widely quoted for his forward thinking remarks, his most famous quote, ""Information about money has become almost as important as money itself,"" is inscribed in the lobby of the New York Library of Science, Industry and Business. Mr. Wriston served as a director of several corporations including General Mills, General Electric, J.C. Penney, Pfizer and ICOS. In June 2004, Mr. Wriston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. He is also the author of two books, In the Twilight of Sovereignty and Risk and Other Four-Letter Words. He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; daughter, Catherine Quintal; son-in-law, Richard Quintal; two grandchildren, Christopher and Barbara Catherine; and his sister, Barbara Wriston. Burial services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date in February. In lieu of flowers, contributions should be made to The Lust Garten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer, 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, New York 11714. WRISTON--Walter B. The Trustees, Life Trustees, Physicians and Staff of NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Overseers, Faculty and Staff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Walter B. Wriston. A financier, philanthropist and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, Mr. Wriston championed the democratizing effects of globalization and information technology. A member of the Board of Trustees of the Hospital since 1975, he lent his uncommon vision, keen intellect and leadership skills to furthering our mission of excellence in patient care. We especially appreciate his early and prescient efforts to bring the benefits of information technology to the Hospital and Medical College as a member of the institutions' Joint Board. We also remember him as the co-founder of ""Cabaret!,"" NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center's annual fund-raising event. He leaves an outstanding legacy of stewardship and benevolence. We will miss his wisdom, kindness, and friendship, and join with all those who knew him in mourning his loss.

ABB's stock fell on the news as investors were concerned that the company's attempt to free itself of pending asbestos claims could take up to a year and cost ABB more than the $1.2 billion it has budgeted. In addition, analysts said, a delay could make it more difficult to complete its plan to sell Lummus and Basic Industries.

Meadow, in New York City on January 19, after a brief illness. She brought to her work an extraordinary ability to engage others in the psychoanalytic experience. She demonstrated her commitment to the field of psychoanalysis as a student, analyst, supervisor, teacher and researcher and advocate for analytic training. She fought for the recognition of psychoanalysis as a distinct discipline and for its establishment as an academic specialty. A most significant achievement, won with her colleagues' collaboration, was to secure accreditation to grant doctoral and master's level degrees in psychoanalysis at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and its affiliates, becoming the first in the country to do so. She was also founder and editor of the journal Modern Psychoanalysis established in 1976. Her published works include Emotional Education: The Theory and Process of Educating Psychoanalysts; Selected Theoretical and Clinical Papers; she was co-author of Treatment of the Narcissistic Neuroses; her most recent book, The New Psychoanalysis, appeared in 2003. She was Chair of the Board of Trustees for the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies and former President of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis. She was also founder and former President of the Society of Modern Psychoanalysts. She served on the Board of Directors of the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis as Membership Director, and was a founder and past president of the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. We will miss her contagious enthusiasm, her creative mind, and her boundless energy. Her singular gifts as a psychoanalyst were revealed in her profound attunement to our emotions, in her uncommon understanding of our psychic conflicts, and in her ability to say the words that never failed to reach our unconscious. A memorial will be held in New York City at a later date.

But it's really sleepy only in the summer, when withering heat forces cafe owners to switch on their mist machines and even the rattlesnakes seek shade. Come winter, mild weather brings the outdoors into play, and Palm Desert shows its active side. Just two hours from Los Angeles, Palm Desert serves as a weekend escape for urbanites seeking inland adventure. Hikers and cyclists take to well-marked trails that wind for miles through the surrounding desert. Open-top Jeep tours make off-road excursions into the lonely, lunar landscape of nearby Joshua Tree National Park. And there is golf, of course, on many of the same fairways where pros compete, and scores of available tennis courts. Though often confused with Palm Springs, its trendier neighbor, Palm Desert has character of its own, with its swank El Paseo shopping district and a range of fine restaurants. The best places draw crowds well into the evening, which is to say that life goes on in Palm Desert, long after the last early-bird special is served. JOSH SENS",2005-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Born on April 1, 1950, in Rockville Centre, NY, Carley was a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Business School. She began her career at Dillon, Read & Co. and, after brief stints at Harry Winston and Warburg, Paribas, Becker, joined Ruane, Cunniff & Co. in 1983, where she was serving as executive vice president and director of both the firm and The Sequoia Fund upon her retirement in 2002. Carley had been diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2001. Famously generous with her time and energy, Carley sat on the Board of Managers at Swarthmore College, the Overseers Visiting Committee at Harvard Business School and the executive committee of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Most recently, she served on the board and as director of the investment committee of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Ct. Though Carley was a sharp-eyed investment analyst, she always had time to share with younger people in the investment business and at her firm. A number of her former associates have gone on to found their own successful firms and credit Carley's advice, support and friendship as critical to their success. Upon her retirement at the end of 2002, Carley and her husband Andy spent most of their time at their home in Lyme, Ct. Carley's natural creativity came to the fore as she spent much of her time landscaping and planting glorious gardens which surrounded her during her final years. She derived enormous pleasure from the radiance she created after she left the world of finance. Carley was a great beauty with impeccable taste, and a creature of unsurpassed kindness. She was a doting aunt and godmother, her husband Andy's perfect mate, a peerless friend and the best possible sport. She will be deeply missed by a wide circle of friends, former associates, and by her dear family. She is survived by her devoted husband, Andy of Lyme, Ct.; her parents, Richard and Marilyn Cunniff of Lloyd Harbor, NY; sisters, Hilary Cunniff of Pennington, NJ, and Jeanne Foussard of St. Paul, MN; brothers, Richard, Jr. of NYC and Peter of Harrington Park, NJ, and her stepdaughter, Eliza Riley of Mill Valley, Ca. A memorial service will be announced shortly. In lieu of flowers, Carley's family would appreciate contributions to The Carley CunniffPeter S. Dixon, M.D. Foundation, a charitable trust in formation, in memory of Carley. Its principal mission is to further understand the power of the human spirit during health and illness as it relates to the practice of medicine. Contributions may be directed to P.O.

Although the actors' unions failed to win a larger share of DVD sales, the proposed agreement, worth about $200 million, includes a 9 percent minimum pay raise over three years and more employer money into the unions' health and pension plans. It also puts in place the framework of a so-called banking system to provide health coverage for series regulars after shows are canceled. Melissa Gilbert, president of the Screen Actors Guild, said: ""We met the expected obstinacy from producers on DVD's and fought the issue until the very end. But it would be neither wise nor responsible to pursue our only alternative, shutting the town down and risk losing the historic gains we achieved."" The agreement, reached late Thursday night, must now go before a joint union board for approval, and then before the full memberships for ratification.

Born on April 1, 1950, in Rockville Centre, NY, Carley was a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Business School. She began her career at Dillon, Read & Co. and, after brief stints at Harry Winston and Warburg, Paribas, Becker, joined Ruane, Cunniff & Co. in 1983, where she was serving as executive vice president and director of both the firm and The Sequoia Fund upon her retirement in 2002. Carley had been diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2001. Famously generous with her time and energy, Carley sat on the Board of Managers at Swarthmore College, the Overseers Visiting Committee at Harvard Business School and the executive committee of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Most recently, she served on the board and as director of the investment committee of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, Ct. Though Carley was a sharp-eyed investment analyst, she always had time to share with younger people in the investment business and at her firm. A number of her former associates have gone on to found their own successful firms and credit Carley's advice, support and friendship as critical to their success. Upon her retirement at the end of 2002, Carley and her husband Andy spent most of their time at their home in Lyme, Ct. Carley's natural creativity came to the fore as she spent much of her time landscaping and planting glorious gardens which surrounded her during her final years. She derived enormous pleasure from the radiance she created after she left the world of finance. Carley was a great beauty with impeccable taste, and a creature of unsurpassed kindness. She was a doting aunt and godmother, her husband Andy's perfect mate, a peerless friend and the best possible sport. She will be deeply missed by a wide circle of friends, former associates, and by her dear family. She is survived by her devoted husband, Andy of Lyme, Ct.; her parents, Richard and Marilyn Cunniff of Lloyd Harbor, NY; sisters, Hilary Cunniff of Pennington, NJ, and Jeanne Foussard of St. Paul, MN; brothers, Richard, Jr. of NYC and Peter of Harrington Park, NJ, and her stepdaughter, Eliza Riley of Mill Valley, Ca. A memorial service will be announced shortly. In lieu of flowers, Carley's family would appreciate contributions to The Carley CunniffPeter S.

us,Inside the List,"COVER STORY: Tom Perrotta's fourth novel, ""Little Children,"" had a short run on the hardcover fiction list last April -- one of this page's happier surprises in 2004. ""Little Children"" is a lovely book about frazzled young suburban couples trying to cope with adultery and child-rearing, and it arrived with a perfect cover image: a pair of crisp Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers, those iconic childhood munchies, facing off against a green lawn. Pepperidge Farm, alas, did not appreciate the homage. The company told Perrotta's publisher, St. Martin's Press, to lose the crackers. St. Martin's complied, substituting a pair of chocolate chip cookies (baked by Dori Weintraub, Perrotta's quick-thinking publicist) in later press runs. ""The cookies were a great fast compromise, but they didn't have the same impact,"" Perrotta said in a telephone interview. ""Little Children"" is out this month in paperback, and seems destined to hit the paperback fiction list in coming weeks. Best of all, Perrotta reports, the goldfish are back -- a photograph of live ones this time, stranded in a plastic sack. ""I love that it's not just a terrific cover but kind of an in-joke,"" he says, ""a way to reclaim the image."" Perrotta -- his previous books include ""Election,"" which spawned the Reese Witherspoon movie -- is also happy that the new cover captures some of the book's darker undertones. ""Isn't there something just a little bit dire,"" he asks, ""about a bag of fish just lying there on the grass?""",2005-01-23T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Wriston was one of the most innovative financiers of our time. Mr. Wriston was born in Middletown, CT, and graduated from Wesleyan University and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Following a year's service as a U.S. State Department officer and a four-year tour with the U.S. Army during World War II, Mr. Wriston joined Citibank in 1946. He held numerous positions at Citibank and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp for 17 years before retiring in 1984 after 38 years with the company. Mr. Wriston was a visionary who saw the future of the banking industry and the important role it would play in the global economy. He is credited with jumpstarting the electronic banking revolution with the introduction of the ATM as well as the expansion of Citibank's international franchise. At the time of Mr. Wriston's retirement, Citibank had bcome the world's largest bank with branches in 79 countries and its investment in computers and software surpassing $1.75 billion. An outspoken advocate on the need for the deregulation of the banking industry and the free flow of capital, Mr. Wriston was also a powerful voice in Washington and was named chairman of President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board in 1982. Widely quoted for his forward thinking remarks, his most famous quote, ""Information about money has become almost as important as money itself,"" is inscribed in the lobby of the New York Library of Science, Industry and Business. Mr. Wriston served as a director of several corporations including General Mills, General Electric, J.C. Penney, Pfizer and ICOS. In June 2004, Mr. Wriston received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. He is also the author of two books, In the Twilight of Sovereignty and Risk and Other Four-Letter Words. He is survived by his wife, Kathryn; daughter, Catherine Quintal; son-in-law, Richard Quintal; two grandchildren, Christopher and Barbara Catherine; and his sister, Barbara Wriston.

He knew that you were suffering, He knew you were in pain, He knew that you would never get well on earth again. He saw the road getting rough and the hills were hard to climb, so He closed your weary eyelids and whispered, ""Peace be thine.""

Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of Federal District Court in Manhattan conducted separate hearings with the two defendants, Carlos Goiry and Luz Marina Munoz, in what is known as the robing room. A panel of five judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the judge to hold new hearings in her courtroom for both defendants, who were convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

us,"Arts, Briefly; Radio Hosts' Song Mocks Tsunami Victims","While ordinary people and celebrities around the world have rallied to raise money for victims of the Asian tsunami, the stars of Hot 97's morning program in New York are mocking those who died or lost relatives in the disaster, which has killed more than 150,000 people. In ""Tsunami Song,"" a parody of the 1980's famine relief number ""We Are the World,"" the WQHT-FM show's morning cast, led by the cantankerous D.J. Miss Jones, right, sing the following lyrics: ""Go find your mommy, I just saw her float by/A tree went through her head, and now the children will be sold to child slavery."" Several racial slurs are also used throughout the song, which went on the air early last week, bringing outraged reaction. In a news conference at City Hall yesterday, Councilman John C. Liu, a Democrat from the 20th District, in Flushing, Queens, denounced the song. ""This is a piece of garbage,"" he said in a telephone interview afterward. ""This is degrading to the more than 200,000 people that perished in this disaster. It's insulting to the thousands of New Yorkers and people around the world engaged in relief efforts, and it's just offensive to all of humankind."" Hot 97 has already pulled the song from its Web site. A person familiar with the situation said executives from the station's parent company, Emmis Communications, had had angry meetings with station executives. A statement now on the Web site, www.hot97.com, reads, ""HOT 97 and 'Miss Jones in the Morning' regret the airing of material that made light of a serious and tragic event,"" adding, ""As an additional sign of HOT 97's commitment to the cause, 'Miss Jones in the Morning,' along with her entire staff, have agreed to contribute one week's pay to tsunami relief efforts.""

We are profoundly saddened by the passing of this extraordinary man-respected, admired and loved by all those privileged and honored to know him. Reared in Fort Worth, TX, he attended Meadowbrook Elementary/Jr. High and Eastern Hills High School. He earned a BA degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1967 where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. He then went on to earn an MBA degree from University of Texas at Austin in 1974. Prior to receiving his graduate degree, he served as a pilot in the Air National Guard Tactical Fighter Squadron in San Antonio, TX and earned the rank of Captain. It was there that he learned three of his favorite words: ""unrestricted climb approved""-that would prove to be a guiding philosophy of his life. In 1970 Mr. Means began his career with Lincoln Property Company in Charlotte, N.C. In 1980 he went on to become one of the founding partners of Paragon Group, a Texas-based, national real estate development firm, and served as CEO of its Central Region and a member of its board of directors. From 1996 to 1998, he was founder and sole shareholder of Means Interests, a Dallas - based commercial real estate company and predecessor to Means-Knaus, LLP, of which he was CEO. He is past chairman of the Urban Land Institute and cofounder and past chairman of the Dallas Real Estate Council. He also co-founded the Dallas Real Estate Council's Unsung Heroes annual event honoring great volunteers in Dallas. His board activities included the North Texas Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks, The Hockaday School, The Science Place, The First Tee of Dallas, and the construction management committee for the Dallas Center for Performing Arts. He was a member of the Sons of the Republic of Texas. Jack London said, ""The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time."" Steve Means was a man who lived-""a dreamer, doer, and pyramid builder."" Having traversed continents from Africa to Asia, he believed that personal travel was part of the richness of life. He was an avid and accomplished tennis player and golfer and had recently won the Senior Club Championship in both at the Dallas Country Club. He raced cars, flew fighter jets, rode motorcycles, and loved to do it all fast. He was a wine connoisseur and seeker of knowledge. Above all, he loved his family who thought he was the ""coolest, funniest, smartest, most generous man in the world.""To cherish his life's memories he leaves his beautiful and loving wife of 34 years, Susan Lancaster Means, his five beloved daughters, Courtney Hester Means of Washington D.C., Blake Lancaster Means of New York, NY, Loren Winslow Means of Dallas, TX, Sutton Lawrence Means of Athens, GA and Chandler Sinclair Means of Boston, MA, his wonderful and adoring mother Lottie Hester Means of Denison, TX , his brother Donald Bert Means of Sausalito, CA, and two sisters, Gerry Means Hairgrove of Colleyville, TX and Gaye Means O'Neill of Santa Monica, CA, two nephews, Landon Barrett Hairgrove and Logan Patrick Hairgrove of Colleyville, TX and many devoted aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws. He was preceded in death by his father, Dr. Bert Leonard Means of Denison, TX. We will all live to carry on his passion for life and remember him in our hearts forever. He was our Hero. A memorial service in celebration of his life will be held Wednesday, January 26 at The St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church at 4:00pm.

us,Story of Jamaican Immigrants Wins Whitbread Award,"Andrea Levy's novel ""Small Island,"" the story of a Jamaican immigrant couple struggling to adjust to life in 1950's London, was selected as the winner last night of the Whitbread Award for the best book of year, one of Britain's most prestigious literary awards. The award, which carries a prize of $47,000, goes to the ""best and most enjoyable book of the year"" by a writer based in Britain or Ireland. The winner is selected by a panel of nine judges from among the previously announced winners of best book in each of five categories: novel, first novel, biography, poetry book and children's book. Sponsored by the hospitality company Whitbread, the parent of hotel, restaurant and fitness brands including Marriott U.K. and T.G.I. Friday's, the award is considered more of a populist prize than the more established Booker, and the Whitbread winner sometimes goes on to outsell the Booker winner by a wide margin. Though Ms. Levy was considered by British bookies to be the favorite to win the Whitbread, she is the first novelist to win both the Whitbread and the Orange Prize, an annual prize for a novel by a woman of any nationality published in Britain, in the same year. ""Small Island"" will be published in the United States in April by Picador. EDWARD WYATT",2005-01-26T05:00:00+0000

Congress appropriated $34 million this year to the United Nations Population Fund, which specializes in prenatal and maternity care. But the White House refuses to release the money because it says that the fund has cooperated with activities in China that promote abortion. With few maternity hospitals in the areas affected by tsunamis, the need is especially acute for pregnant women, said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Long Island. Mr. Israel visited the region with Representative Joseph Crowley, above, whose district in Queens and the Bronx includes the nation's second-largest South Asian community.

The Sept. 11 terrorists totaled 19, which security experts say is about three times more than defined in the current rule. The wording of the rule itself, made tougher after 9/11, is classified. The state officials wrote in support of a petition by a Los Angeles-based group, Committee to Bridge the Gap, which wants shields built to protect reactors against hijacked jetliners.

The four -- Feroz Abbasi, Moazzam Begg, Richard Belmar and Martin Mubanga -- were arrested to face questioning by law enforcement officials. It is unclear when, or if, they might be freed; the government has the option of putting them on trial on terrorism charges. Lawyers for the men have said that Mr. Begg and Mr. Abbasi were held in solitary confinement for nearly two years. The four were arrested in 2001 and 2002 in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Zambia. Their release came after months of high-level talks between the British and American governments and pressure from British advocacy groups. Mr. Begg said late last year in a declassified letter that he had been the victim of ""vindictive torture"" at Guantnamo and that he had witnessed the deaths of two other detainees there.

But in the lineup's debut, the union appeared to work. As expected, the third episode of ""American Idol"" mowed over all competitors, drawing an estimated 27.7 million viewers, according to the overnight Nielsen ratings, and winning in every demographic that advertisers like. In the hour that followed, ""House,"" lost more than half of the ""Idol"" audience, but it still managed to be No.1 in total viewers and among 18-to-49-year-olds, beating original episodes on all the other networks for the first time. One of the shows in its wake was NBC's ""Scrubs,"" which has recently moved to 9 p.m. and continues to do poorly in the overnight ratings.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   JOHNSON, PHILIP","JOHNSON -- Philip. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of our esteemed Trustee Philip Johnson, whose devotion to the Museum spans its entire seventy-five-year existence. A leading member of the circle of young aesthetes who both supported and were nurtured by the vision of Alfred H. Barr, Jr., MoMA's founding director, Philip passionately devoted his energies to the institution throughout its history. A great number of its critically important milestones bear his imprint. Philip was present at the opening of the Museum, in 1929; he was the first director of MoMA's Department of Architecture -- unique among museums at the time--in 1931; with Henry-Russell Hitchcock, he organized the Museum's first architectural exhibition, the landmark ""International Style"" show, in 1932; and he organized ""Machine Art,"" the Museum's first major exhibition on industrial design, in 1934. In 1949 he was appointed the first director of the recently unified Department of Architecture and Design, stepping down in 1954 to become the first Chairman of the Trustee Committee on Architecture and Design, a position in which he served for thirty-seven years. He joined the newly formed International Council of The Museum of Modern Art in 1955 and was named a Trustee of the Museum in 1957. Philip's devotion to Barr and to MoMA helped shape the institution not only intellectually but physically. Having returned to Harvard at the age of thirty-four to train as a professional architect, he became the Museum's principal adviser in its building programs and often served as its architect himself. Beginning in 1949, with the Grace Rainey Rogers Annex, he designed numerous structures and spaces that visually enhanced the Museum, including the beloved Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, for fifty years the institution's very heart--a cherished restful space within the metropolitan bustle of midtown Manhattan. The south facade of his 1964 East Wing, now beautifully restored as part of the Museum's recent renovation and expansion, stands as a tribute to his midcareer devotion to the International Style architecture of Mies van der Rohe, whose reputation in America was largely built upon Philip's faithful support. Philip not only gave of his energies and talents but also bestowed upon the Museum an astounding munificence -- in works of art as well as financial support--that will long be remembered in an institution that is known for the generosity of its leaders. Instrumental to the extraordinary breadth of the collection of the Department of Architecture and Design, his giving also touched every other curatorial department, from drawings by Marcel Duchamp to prints by Donald Judd to photographs by Lionel Feininger. The experience of visitors to The Museum of Modern Art would be decidedly diminished without the magnificent paintings Philip gave it, including Oskar Schlemmer's ""Bauhaus Stairway,"" Mark Rothko's ""Number 10,"" Jasper Johns's ""Flag,"" Andy Warhol's ""Gold Marilyn Monroe,"" and Roy Lichtenstein's ""Girl with a Ball."" While crisscrossing Europe with Henry-Russell Hitchcock in 1930 to see the new architecture they would soon dub the International Style, the twenty-four-yearold Philip wrote to his mother of what had become a notable event: ""Last night I hardly dreamt of buildings at all. It is a strange fact that not one night has gone by but that I have had some dream of architecture."" Indeed, Philip never stopped dreaming of architecture, and for this, the staff, the Department of Architecture and Design, and the Trustees of The Museum of Modern Art will always be grateful. We extend our sympathies to David Whitney, his partner of forty-two years, to Mrs. John B. Dempsey, his sister, and to his entire family.

Ilse Helene Bretschneider was born December 22, 1906, in Buffalo, New York, and moved to Oakland, California with her family following her high school graduation at 15. She later graduated with Great Distinction from San Jose State College, where she was elected to Phi Kappa Phi. A gifted teacher, Ilse taught elementary school first in Modesto, California, beginning in 1956, and then on the Monterey Peninsula until her retirement in 1974. In 1978 she moved to New York, where she served as a tutor in the public school system, a reader for Lighthouse International, and a founding member and treasurer of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma International, a professional honorary society of women educators. She is also survived by a brother, Herman Schleusener, of Lake-of-the-Pines, California. Ilse was a wonderful, positive presence, a loving individual who possessed an appreciation of both children and adults, a youthful enthusiasm - for books, ideas, new experiences - a generous heart, an enduring love of life and a great capacity for laughter.

Philip was present at the opening of the Museum in 1929. He organized the Museum's first architecture and design exhibitions: ""The International Style"" in 1932 and ""Machine Art"" in 1934. In 1949 he was appointed the first director of the recently unified Department of Architecture and Design, stepping down in 1954 to become the first Chairman of the Trustee Committee on Architecture and Design, a position in which he served for thirty-seven years. Beginning in 1949, Philip designed numerous structures and spaces that visually enhanced the Museum, including the beloved Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. The south facade of his 1964 East Wing, now beautifully restored as part of the Museum's recent renovation and expansion, stands as a tribute to his mid-career devotion to the International Style architecture of Mies van der Rohe. Philip bestowed upon the Museum an astounding munificence--in works of art as well as financial support--that will long be remembered in an institution that is known for the generosity of its leaders. Instrumental to the extraordinary breadth of the collection of the Department of Architecture and Design, his giving also touched almost every other curatorial department. The experience of visitors to The Museum of Modern Art would be decidedly diminished without the magnificent paintings Philip gave it, including Oskar Schlemmer's Bauhaus Stairway, Mark Rothko's Number 10, Jasper Johns's Flag, Andy Warhol's Gold Marilyn Monroe, and Roy Lichtenstein's Girl with a Ball.

In 1953, divorced and the mother of two children, she met the artist Hans Bellmer, 14 years her senior, with whom she began a long, fruitful but tormenting relationship. She moved with him to Paris, where she met members of the Surrealist circle, including Henri Michaux, then immersed in his decadelong experiments with mind-altering drugs. Zrn called their encounter a ""miracle,"" but it marked the onset of the mental illness the plagued her for the rest of her life. Despite repeated confinements to psychiatric hospitals, she wrote books of poetry, fiction and autobiography, and during a brief period in the 1960's produced the extraordinary drawings on view at Ubu Gallery. Inspired in part by Surrealist automatic techniques and by Asian and African objects that she remembered from her childhood home, the pictures are a cross between extravagant doodles and minutely controlled images of fantastic beings: human and bestial; figurative and abstract; composed of webs of delicate pen strokes in red, black or white ink. Like run-on nightmares, they are at once grippingly varied in detail and almost crushingly similar in overall tone. In 1970, with an autobiographical novel, ""Dark Spring,"" completed, Zrn once again left a clinic to return to Bellmer, who, paralyized from a stroke, ended the relationship. Having nowhere to go, she jumped from the window of his apartment to her death. (Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212)753-4444, through April 16.) HOLLAND COTTER",2005-01-28T05:00:00+0000

For this emotionally rich interpretation of Shakespeare's comedy of cross-dressed courtship, Sir Peter movingly emphasizes how scary it is to be young, romantic and thin-skinned in a treacherous world. Rebecca Hall (Sir Peter's daughter) has received plenty of well-deserved acclaim for presenting a Rosalind as notable for her insecurity as for her cleverness. But spare a few plaudits for a recent graduate of Cambridge University named Dan Stevens, who plays Rosalind's gawky, moony suitor, Orlando. Mr. Stevens, above, tempers his teen-idol good looks with a vibrant, appropriately Shakespearean sense of how love makes fools of even the heartiest young men. His tongue-tied wonder upon Orlando's first encounter with Rosalind provokes guaranteed laughter, even as it makes many of those watching him feel a bit like the old rou played by Maurice Chevalier in ""Gigi,"" who sang, ""I'm glad I'm not young anymore.""

Orphaned by mother France, dominated by Britain (after what Qubcois still call the Conquest) then for years by majority-Anglophone Canada, the people of Quebec have followed Voltaire's advice to tend to their own garden. This is especially true of Quebec City, the provincial capital. Proudly dated, lovingly maintained, Quebec City has charm to spare, particularly within the walls of the Old Town and in the Lower Town tucked between those walls and the St. Lawrence River. Winter brings comically low temperatures that linger well into March, but in a somewhat manic variation on ""If God gives you lemons, make lemonade,"" Quebec puts on a raucous carnival, which this year starts today and runs through Feb. 13. Travelers with a retro lifestyle will find the city especially welcoming: at pretty much any hour you can find a drink, smoke indoors, wear fur and eat wild game. This backwoods vigor coexists with serious refinement that can be seen in the quality of the restaurants and hotels and the profusion of art galleries. To a Yankee it all seems European. But there is no place like this in Europe; there is nothing else like it in North America, either. And that's reason enough to celebrate. SCOTT L. MALCOMSON",2005-01-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings; JANIE TAYLOR,"Ms. Taylor is one of those dancers you keep rediscovering, season after season, seeing her expressive mix of slyness, aplomb and technical pizazz as if for the first time. Where has she been all this time, you wonder, sometimes because Ms. Taylor, above, seems to disappear or dance eccentrically. But then you remember feeling the same surprised delight the last time you saw her dance. This weekend New York City Ballet will present a sort of Taylor mini-feast, with performances in Jerome Robbins's glowing, formalistic ""Goldberg Variations"" tonight; in George Balanchine's ebullient ""Who Cares?"" tomorrow afternoon; and in Peter Martins's ""Eros Piano"" tomorrow night. They've given the girl the day off on Sunday. From Houston, Ms. Taylor finished her training at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, graduating in 1998 to become a company apprentice for a month before moving into the corps. Lead roles came to her the next year. Only 18 then, she also brought a distinctive perfume and abandon to the doomed young heroine of ""La Valse."" Last week she was named a principal. There is something of Suzanne Farrell's suspect innocence in Ms. Taylor's performing. But mostly, there is the caviar pleasure of her smooth reconciliation of opposites: recklessness and serenity, bold incisiveness and dreaming amplitude. Steps, gestures and characterizations fall away before the immediacy of her dancing. And for hardcore or distant Taylor connoisseurs, there is always the 2003 video ""Barbie in 'Swan Lake,""' for which she served as the model for Carlita the Skunk. (Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, Manhattan, (212)870-5570. Tickets: $30 to $83.) JENNIFER DUNNING",2005-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Prosecutors had claimed that the defense was improperly striking whites from the jury. But Judge Johnson found that the defense had reasons unrelated to race for trying to exclude the men. One was the apparent political conservatism of a military driver that might render him unsympathetic to the defense. William Glaberson (NYT)",2005-01-28T05:00:00+0000

It is the first time that the disease, clinically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has been found in a goat under natural conditions. It was widespread in cattle in Europe in the 1990's and has more recently appeared in Canada. Experts originally believed that the goat, from a farm in Als, in southern France, was afflicted with scrapie, a disease common to sheep that is similar to mad cow. The goat and its herd of about 300 animals were destroyed, and officials said there was no danger that their meat had entered the human food chain. French farmers raise about 1.2 million goats, most of them to provide milk for dairy products like cheese. John Tagliabue (NYT)",2005-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Against that lineup, NBC was able to win at 8 and 10 p.m., but an original ""Apprentice"" came in second to a ""CSI"" repeat for the second week in a row. On Fox, ""The O.C."" continued to benefit from the absence of CBS's ""Survivor."" The soap opera drew 8.07 million viewers, its best numbers since early November.

us,Up Front,"After her first book, ""A Return to Modesty,"" appeared in 1999, it seemed Wendy Shalit was everywhere. Only two years out of Williams College, where she earned a degree in philosophy, she was suddenly the media's favorite -- or at least its most frequently cited -- defender of what she called ""the lost virtue"" of modesty and a proponent of the view that the sexual revolution has done American men and women more harm than good. Then, just as suddenly, Shalit dropped out of the culture wars. What happened? As Shalit mentions in her essay, ""The Observant Reader,"" which begins on Page 16, she spent about three years in Israel, at first satisfying her curiosity about her religious heritage and then committing herself to it. Her Torah studies didn't lead her to become a rabbi -- much to the disappointment of her grandmother -- but they did lead to marriage and family and the traditions of Orthodox Judaism. Shalit and her husband and infant son now live in Toronto, where she's at work on a second book, based on the letters she exchanged with young readers after the publication of ""A Return to Modesty."" Does her essay for us on Orthodox Jews in contemporary American fiction signal her return to the culture wars? ""Some may treat it as a war,"" Shalit responds, ""but to me it's just about challenging the norm, offering ideas and approaches that help people find their own authentic voices.""

With his turban rakishly tufted, his black sirwal trousers rolled up, his belt-loop silver dagger, he called to mind a pirate, if a kindhearted one.

Zane's good-natured books are filled with smart, believable and self-deprecating young and middle-aged black characters; they are also filled with sex scenes that will smoke your fingerprints off. (Upon learning that Zane's novels were being issued in Japan, The Guardian of London took pity on the translator who had to render faithfully lines like: ""No matter how hoochie I tried to be, she out-hoochied me every single time."") Zane is the pseudonym of a suburban mother of three -- she refuses to divulge her real name -- who is in her late 30's and lives outside Washington. She began writing erotic stories in the late 1990's when, as a single mother, she was looking for something to do after her children went to bed. The stories became popular after she posted them on the Web, and she later self-published her first book, ""The Sex Chronicles,"" which sold more than 100,000 copies. Zane is well on her way to establishing herself as a habanero-hot global brand. She has founded her own publishing house, owns a bookstore, has film deals in the works and hopes to start a line of lingerie.

Philip was present at the opening of the Museum in 1929. He organized the Museum's first architecture and design exhibitions: ""The International Style"" in 1932 and ""Machine Art"" in 1934. In 1949 he was appointed the first director of the recently unified Department of Architecture and Design, stepping down in 1954 to become the first Chairman of the Trustee Committee on Architecture and Design, a position in which he served for thirty-seven years. Beginning in 1949, Philip designed numerous structures and spaces that visually enhanced the Museum, including the beloved Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. The south facade of his 1964 East Wing, now beautifully restored as part of the Museum's recent renovation and expansion, stands as a tribute to his mid-career devotion to the International Style architecture of Mies van der Rohe. Philip bestowed upon the Museum an astounding munificence--in works of art as well as financial support--that will long be remembered in an institution that is known for the generosity of its leaders. Instrumental to the extraordinary breadth of the collection of the Department of Architecture and Design, his giving also touched almost every other curatorial department. The experience of visitors to The Museum of Modern Art would be decidedly diminished without the magnificent paintings Philip gave it, including Oskar Schlemmer's Bauhaus Stairway, Mark Rothko's Number 10, Jasper Johns's Flag, Andy Warhol's Gold Marilyn Monroe, and Roy Lichtenstein's Girl with a Ball.

More than 20 young women from a Canadian hockey team were on the bus, which split in two. Three women were in intensive care yesterday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, and nine people were listed in satisfactory condition. The dead were identified as the hockey coach, Richard Edwards, 46; his son, Brian Edwards, 13; and Catherine Roach, 50. All were from Ontario, Canada. Ernest D. Zeiset, 42, of Pennsylvania, the driver of the tractor-trailer, was also killed. He had stopped to let out his dog, said Trooper Mark J. O'Donnell. The bus driver, Ryan Comfort, 25, was hospitalized with a leg injury. The Livingston County district attorney, Thomas E. Moran, said it would be days before investigators reached a conclusion on what caused the wreck. Michelle York (NYT)",2005-01-31T05:00:00+0000
