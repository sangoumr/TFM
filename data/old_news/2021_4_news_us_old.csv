He kept his hair longer in the front so that a thicket of bangs swept just past his left eyebrow. He was tall, and if you looked closely, he was attractive.

She translated the announcements and told me when it was my turn to be fitted. That woman was HoYeon Jung  she was a year older than I was, and it was her third New York Fashion Week. In Korean culture, we take care of each other, especially when were working overseas. We commute to fittings and eat together between shows.

But lightning doesnt always strike on initial acquaintance.

But when you immerse yourself in the shifting perspectives of CATHEDRAL (Europa, 624 pp., $28), what you also discover is a clever (even postmodern?) commentary on the ironies of history. As he traces the fates of a lively scrum of characters, Hopkins shows how the seemingly firm hierarchies of one era can be grounded in the social strife  and sometimes sheer luck  of those that came before. In this nimble mesh of stories, a trading empire can have its roots in something as simple as the theft of a wig.

Can I Reprogram His Feed?,"For nearly his entire life, my 80-something-year-old father has been a quiet, gentle and deeply religious man who went to Mass and said the rosary daily. Although his political views have always been conservative, he has also always believed in kindness and fairness. Since the start of the pandemic, his social interactions have become severely reduced, limited to daily calls from me (I live across the country), weekly visits from my brother and the occasional shopping trips and church attendance. As our mother passed away before the pandemic, his one loyal companion has been his iPad and YouTube. Because of his viewing of religious programs, YouTube has increasingly steered him toward conservative media, so that he is now obsessed with right-wing extremist politics and is absolutely against taking the Covid vaccine. Every time my brother or I have a conversation with him, he talks politics and pushes his views, and even after we asked him to stop, he tries to get the last word in by sending us angry emails or texts. Now both of us try to avoid having any interactions with him. I have the password to his YouTube account from a year ago when I helped him with a tech problem. In order to preserve our relationship, Im thinking about going into his account to delete and pause his viewing history, and perhaps put in some links to more wholesome entertainment such as music and soccer to counter the constant bombardment of extremism. My justification is that if he is being brainwashed by an algorithm, then I might as well use the algorithm to steer him back to his old self so that we can at least have a normal conversation.

And its not just about Greece. There are Turkish flatbreads and lamb meatballs. The executive chef is Rob Lawson, who was with Mr. Fraser at 701West in the Times Square Edition. With his beverage director, Amy Racine, Mr. Fraser has assembled a wine and spirits list that includes many selections from Greece and Turkey. In addition, Ms. Racine manages a roving cart of sweet and digestif libations from Greece and Turkey that are served with typical sweets.

Though Zauner, 32, grew up in Eugene, Ore., she was born in Seoul, and revisiting the food of her childhood  particularly dotorimuk-muchim, or seasoned acorn jelly, which she ordered often from a noodle restaurant near the apartment  caused new emotions to surface. Traditionally made from foraged acorns that are shelled, dried, ground into a powdery starch, cooked in water and served cold as banchan, or a side dish, its gelatinous texture and earthy flavor triggered a visceral response, first at her fingertips, then on her tongue.

Tudor kings and queens cavort cartoonishly across 16-foot-wide, unprimed canvases. Disembodied mouths chomp through exploding cookies.

Among them are the myriad atrocities perpetuated against Indigenous people in what we now call America (and beyond), individuals whose experiences are to this day too often distorted or left untold. Lately, though, there have been some hard-won gains on that front, from professional sports teams finally changing their names to the Metropolitan Museum of Art hiring Patricia Marroquin Norby as its first curator of Native American Art. It is not necessarily the job of the artist to shine a light where others have not, but self-expression  especially that of individuals who, whether because of their race, gender, sexuality or any other marker of identity, some might seek to deny  can be an inherently radical act, one to which attention should be paid. For this story, we asked 10 queer Indigenous talents from different parts of North America to share one of their artworks and talk about its genesis, and about their practice at large. Like the selections themselves, the conversations, which touched on materials, color schemes, gender fluidity, decolonization, oral history and more, were testaments to the strength  and beauty  of a multiplicity of voices.",2021-04-23T19:35:06+0000

He closed Lupulo more than three years ago and Aldea a little over a year ago after a 10-year run, because he felt that he needed a break. Now, he will be the chef and a partner at this new SoHo restaurant. He will be running it with David Rabin, a hospitality veteran who is also a partner in the Lambs Club, the new Sona and others. I always knew Id be back, Mr. Mendes said. Ive spent the past year cooking at home, baking sourdough and exploring new flavors, and Im ready to translate them to a restaurant. Veranda is in the new ModernHaus hotel, a property that was the James, and has been completely reconfigured. Verandas main dining room is up from the street, and designed in greenhouse fashion with a retractable ceiling. Its surrounded by outdoor seating on an upper terrace and a multilevel garden. Mr. Mendess menu is global but lightly strewn with Portuguese touches. Think flor de sal (fleur de sel) and olive oil for the sourdough bread, salt cod croquettes, Goan curry for shrimp, and a piri piri marinade used on grilled chicken. Chicken rice is his take on paella. He also delivers seasonality with all the green stuff you hunger for right now. Ive been cooking farm-to-table since I worked at Bouley and in France, he said. The bounty is incredible now. A number of products, including the sourdough bread, are sold to take home. (Opens Friday) ",2021-04-27T16:44:25+0000
