us,Early Swedish Movies at the Modern,"Ingmar Bergman's father was a clergyman. On Sundays after the service he would show movies, generally Swedish ones.Predestination is hardly necessary with a background like that. Bergman's films are modern sermons, plotted in an empty church and shapedmore than most of us realizeby the shadow and light, the bleak revelry, the sense of ghosts in the land and the mind contained the early Swedish films shown on those Sunday afternoons.This weekend, and lasting until early April, the Museum of Modern Art will be showing some of Bergman's Sunday afternoons: a collection of the best surviving examples of the Swedish silent film.Not that the program is set up that way. The show, organized by the Museum's Film Department with the help of the Swedish Film Institute (which is supplying the prints), sets out to present a body of work with a value of its own; one little known in this country. The show centers mainly around the work of two major directors, Victor Sjostrom and Mauritz Stiller.Yet take Sjostrom's ""The Phantom Chariot,"" (March 5 and 7). It is framed in blackness, as if the light were dark and the highlights were fugitive shadows. It starts with a wild drunken brawl in a churchyard. The protagonist, played by Sjostrom himselfwho so many years later would play the old rememberer in Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries""is knocked on the head. The rest of the picture is a mixture of delusion and reality: fantasies about a chariot sent to collect the souls of the dead, interwoven with flashbacks of the protagonist's own life and loves.Complex, savage and with a half-fraudulent mystery. Coarse, half-rustic figures propelled or led on by a ghostly illumination. It is a film Bergman particularly remembered being impressed by; and it is impossible to see it now without getting a new perspective upon the harsh originality of ""The Seventh Seal.""Sjostrom organized his films with the entrances and exits, the playing to a motionless camera, that is clearly derived from the theater. The plays, furthermore, are melodramas, and the acting has all the eye-rolling and underlined gesture common to films made between 1910 and 1920.The figures scurry and posture in a fashion that is too obsolete to be interesting. But there is something more. In ""Terje Vigen,"" which is playing on Sunday, the movement is more poetic than dramatic. It is, in fact, the recreation of a poem by Ibsen; the legend of a man who lives by the sea and loses wife and child in a famine.The reality in this still and moving film is not the plot, but the landscapes. The landscape of rock and water, and of the gray unchanging sky. The landscape of Terje Vigen's face. Suffering is as unmovable on that face as the seams on the rocks or the waveswhich move but are replacedon the sea. The motionless camera stretches out time in such a fashion that none of these things are static but simply proceed at the speed of the earth.In contrast with the work of Sjostrom is the more agile and witty style of Mauritz Stiller, a director who inspired Lubitsch, for example. In ""Love and Journalism,"" also playing Sunday, the plot cavorts suitably as farce. A handsome explorer returns home. A woman reporter, barred from an interview, gets a job as a pretty incompetent maid. Pretty and incompetent, that is. Love strikes, etc., etc.The real movement is not in the plot, though, but in the faces and stances of the lovers. It is a dialogue of gesture; Karin Molander as the journalist has a face that is an epigram, a bodyrelaxing and going tautthat is a retort.Another Stiller comedy, considerably more sophisticated, is his ""Erotikon, (March 3 and 5); a witty, perhaps ambiguous mockery of the rich, it tells of a series of shifting relationships, among a professor, his wife, a sculptor who loves her, and others. Temptation is a game more than a reality. The mind dabbles in it; what the bodies do is almost beside the point.The more dramatic side of Stiller's work is also shown. ""The Treasure of Arne"" (Feb. 20 and 22) is an elaborate epic tragedy, taking place in the 16th century, and based on a novel by Selma Lagerlof. Snowbound landscapes and the sea are used to frame the small figures and their struggles.The balance of the program includes other works by Sjostrom and Stiller, and some by lesser-known directors. In particular, there is ""The Prisoner of Karlsten's Fortress,"" which was shown yesterday. It is a knotty and silly melodrama about a man who steals a scientist's secret formula for making explosives, and hides the professor's daughter in a castle. The filmappropriately, by the Hasselblad Studios, which in those days made films as well as camerasis mainly about deep focus.One short film, ""Peter the Tramp,"" (March 12 and 18) used Greta Garbo when she was still known as Greta Gustaffson.At every conceivable opportunity people are photographed through doorways, down passages and on the other side of windows, in order to show off the technique. It is an early example of technological follywe have the movie for the sake of the camera instead of vice versa.For programs and times on the day of a show, call 956-7078.

It's a documentary, photographed in black-and-white and, I suspect, it's designed principally for television; but it's one of the more moving, more cheering theatrical experiences available in New York this weekend.It can be seen at noon tomorrow and Sunday, this weekend and next, at the Elgin Theater, on a double bill with ""On the Line,"" a more elaboratein color and longer by five minutesdocumentary that, like ""Union Maids,"" deals with cooperative social action, which is sometimes but not always trade-unionism.""Union Maids"" is very much about trade-unionism but it's even more about three extraordinary women, Kate Hyndman, Stella Nowicki and Sylvia Woods who, in the course of three separate interviews, which are intercut with each other and with period newsreel footage, recall their lives as women laborers and union organizers in Chicago in the late 20's and 30's.It was a sometimes brutal, bitter, mingy time for all labor and especially for women who didn't believe their places were necessarily in the home. Yet it was also a time of terrific hope, when one could believe in social and political progress and measure it by the concessions won through group action.Kate, who appears to be the oldest of the three, has the face of an elderly schoolmistress whose seeming severity is constantly denied by her comic self-appraisals and by the warmth and the passion with which she recalls her life as a labor militant and feminist. That didn't always go down too well with the labor militants who were male.Stella grew up on a farm in Michigan and, as a young woman, moved to Chicago to work in the stockyards. Sylvia, a black woman who was born and bred in New Orleans, also moved to Chicago at an early age. There, she was active in organizing the laundry workers who, as she remembers with biting humor, were mostly women who worked seven days a week and had to provide written explanations to their bosses when they were absent.Largely because of Sylvia this requirement was eventually dropped. Her ploy: to persuade every woman to give as the reason for her absenteeism, ""just tired.""Julia Reichert, James Klein and Miles Mogulescu, who jointly directed and produced ""Union Maids,"" never get in the way of their subjects and never put words in their mouths. They don't have to Sylvia, Stella and Kate are three naturals, characters whose hearts and minds leap off the screen with a kind of grace and nobility I haven't seen in a documentary since Jerry Bruck's ""I.F. Stone's Weekly.""""On the Line,"" directed and produced by Barbara Margolis, has no comparable focal points and, indeed, I'm not quite sure if it has any focal point at all. It looks rather like a documentary whose material failed to provide the film maker with the kind of drama and narrative shape that Barbara Koppel found in her ""Harlan County, U.S.A."" Its material includes interviews with workers at the Ford Motor Company in Mahwah, N.J., with rent-striking residents at Co-op City in the Bronx, an engineer at an RCA plant who feels the company no longer values him and with a Medicaid worker.Their common complaint is that contemporary America is running amok with rising prices, unemployment, and a generally heedless attitude on the part of the people who might be able to control the economy.There's nothing especially wrong with the vision the film presents, but the vision is too diffuse to have much impact on the screen. The film maker wants it to say more than she does, to which end, I suppose, Miss Margolis uses an off-screen narrator (Rip Torn), which gives ""On the Line"" the feeling of an industrial film. The best, most effective, documentaries tend to speak for themselves, not through off-screen mouthpieces.",1977-02-04T05:00:00+0000

The setting made a thematic point that the escalating bombardment of North Vietnam flouted the U.N. Charter. For King, who had been agonizing over his proper role in the peace movement, the demonstration was full of hazards: It involved him in a momentary alliance with angry radicals who saw the war as an ultimate expression of American wickedness. King saw it as a detour, a regression, even a sickness, but he did not want his protest to be construed as antiAmerican. So he turned to the most effective negotiator in his entourage, the Rev. Andrew Young. Working quietly behind the scenes, the youthful Congregationalist minister set the terms for King's involvement in the protest, making sure Vietcong flags would be kept at a distance and radical rhetoric restrained. The protest, he insisted, had to appeal to the country's better instincts.",1977-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,'Dick and Jane' in Screen Romp,"When Dick Harper (George Segal) loses his job as a Los Angeles aerospace engineer, he and his wife Jane (Jane Fonda) find themselves in the classic bind of the once-upwardly mobile. They have no bank balance, owe $72,000 on their house and have already borrowed the limit on their life insurance. Their swimming pool is still an ugly hole in the ground Jane hopes they can finish it and then economize by not heating it. When they are two months in arrears, the landscape company sends around a crew to remove their plants and trees, and, while they're at it, to roll up the lawn. What to do?Dick and Jane take to crime, which is the point at which you have every right to expect that ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is going to stumble over the cuteness of the gimmick that, from the opening credits, has been shadowing the film like a gloomy bill collector. The good news is that it doesn't. ""Fun With Dick and Jane,"" written by David Giler, Jerry Belson and Mordecai Richler, and directed by Ted Kotcheff, is a deceptively sunny, sometimes uproariously funny comedy about the bad taste, vulgarity and awful aimlessness of a certain kind of middle-class American affluence.Buried not very deeply within the film, there is a small flaw. We are asked to like and to sympathize with Dick and Jane, played by Mr. Segal and Miss Fonda with a fine, earnest kind of intensity I associate with good schewball comedy of the past, and we do like them enormously, even though the characters are completely dedicated to maintaining all-wrong values. In this respect, the film seems to want to stand on both sides of the fence at once, to take credit for having a social conscience while not really honoring it. It's not enough for us to be told that Dick and Jane are really ripping off the system. They aren't that believably cynical.This may be taking the film more seriously than anyone intended, though I doubt it. Mr. Kotcheff and the men who wrote ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" are so aware of what it's about that they haven't hesitated to employ bad taste in their attack on it. There is no other way to explain, for example, a throwaway comedy bit that features a man whose vocal chords have been removed and who must talk through a transistorized amplifier. On the surface this has nothing to do with social satire and everything to do with callousness, but then it may be argued that ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is about the callousness of the system. I'm not convinced it works.What does work are the series of scenes that are virtually blackout sketches that define, first, the degradation to which Dick and Jane are brought by their poverty, and, second, their criminal escapades, whether holding up the telephone companywhile all the legitimate customers cheeror stealing the offering at a church whose pastor preaches the profit motive""Remember,"" he tells his flock, ""the cross is a plus sign.""I never have trouble remembering that Miss Fonda is a fine dramatic actress but I'm surprised all over again every time I see her do comedy with the mixture of comic intelligence and abandon she shows here. One sequence in particular, in which she makes a botch of an attempt at fashion modeling in a crowded restaurant at lunchtime, is a nearly priceless piece of modern slapstick. Another is Dick's brief appearance as a supernumerary in the opera chorus. Old stuff and still good.The members of the supporting cast, headed by Ed McMahon as Dick's alternately smarmy and sozzled former employer, are excellent. Among those who come to mind first are John Dehner and Mary Jackson, as Jane's rich parents who, when Dick loses his job, congratulate her on the opportunity life has provided to demonstrate her self-reliance. ""Oh,"" says mom, tears in her eyes, ""I'm so happy for you!""""Fun With Dick and Jane,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes a lot of vulgar language and gestures that are perfectly in keeping with the point and method of the movie.",1977-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'Twilight's Last Gleaming': No Star,"""Twilight's Last Gleaming"" is Robert Aldrich's deadly solemn, gadgety suspense-melodrama about a disgruntled, liberal-thinking United States general, a Vietnam veteran whose out-spoken antiwar views got him railroaded to prison on a trumped-up murder charge.The general, played by Burt Lancaster, breaks out of the slammer with three other Death-Row prisoners to take possession of a Titan missile base in Montana. With his finger on the button, the renegade general demands $10-million in unmarked bills, the use of Air Force One to take him and his associates to the country of their choice, the President of the United States as hostage and, most important, a full disclosure of ""the facts"" about the war.These ""facts,"" unfortunately, are fully disclosed in the course of ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"" and immediately ridicule the movie's claims to importance contained in its publicity. Instead, the facts suggest that Mr. Aldrich, who directed the film, and Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch, who wrote the screenplay, set in 1981, haven't yet caught up even to 1975.The facts are contained in a Top Secret memo reporting that a former President of the United States agreed to continue the Vietnam War at the insistence of his military advisers and cabinet members who argued that the senseless slaughter was the only way the Soviets would understand that the United States meant business. Good grief! All of the characters in the film, whose minds are so tiny they've totally forgotten the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, are convinced that such a move toward ""open"" government would result in the collapse of the American way of life and death.In ""Twilight's Last Gleaming,"" this memo is what Alfred Hitchcock likes to call the ""McGuffin,"" the secret thing or information that heroes and villains battle for in any Hitchcock espionage film. Mr. Hitchcock knows enough never to tell us what the McGuffin is, since nothing can seem as important as it's been built up to be. I've gone into it at some length here because the McGuffin of ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"" is a measure of the movie's wooly-headedness.Otherwise, the film has the appearance of a rather classy television show in which people are forever picking up and putting down telephones, buzzing secretaries, and getting into and out of various means of transportationautomobiles, jet airplanes, helicopters and elevators.Mr. Aldrich obtains a good deal of suspense from idiotic material, though his use of the split-screen doesn't double suspense as often as it Cuts it in half. There also are two decently straight performances by Mr. Lancaster and Charles Durning, who plays the President as the sort of man who has adequacy thrust upon him.The other actors are mostly terrible, including some who look as if they'd passed through old age and gone on to the embalming room.I suppose that ""Twilight's Last Gleaming,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, might also claim to be important in pointing out how close nuclear destruction always is, but this is important the way that a sign, ""Don't Walk On The Tracks,"" is important as literature.",1977-02-10T05:00:00+0000

This was the approach taken by President Carter this week in his first postinauguration news conference. When asked his attitude toward vetoing an economic stimulation package if Congress sent it to him in a form significantly different from what he had proposed, Mr. Carter said that, while he reserved the constitutional right to veto legislation that he considered contrary to the best interests of the nation, he thought the best way to avoid vetoes was for him to work intimately with Congressand that he intended to do. He said his sense was that Congress was likely to append amendments to the fiscal package, which is to total $31 billion over the next two years, but that he could accept Congressional changes, provided that they did not drastically alter the size of the package.",1977-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Terrorists try to steal it and are shotwhat are United States Marine guards doing inside the W.H.O.?but one escapes to hide in the Geneva-Stockholm Express.Gray and sweaty, the terrorist goes through the train, breathing in the passengers' faces and retching over the rice in the galley. Burt Lancaster, the United States Army Intelligence chief in Geneva, learns he has a problem. Instead of getting the Swiss authorities to stop the train and quarantine everyone, he manages in some unexplained fashion to have the train sealed and dispatched to Poland.(Questions: Why doesn't he want to tell the Swiss authorities? Embarrassment? Why is it less embarrassing to tell the Polish authorities? And how does an Army Intelligence colonel manage to reroute a train without getting the national railroad officials to help?)But the border-crossing bridge is known to be fatally deficient. The conductor knows it, and so do the 1,000 passengers on board. They try to reach the engineer and tell him to stop the train. They engage in a wild machine-gun battle with American soldiers placed on the train to prevent this.(Questions: Would American soldiers really shoot down passengers so they could all go over a worm-eaten bridge together? If the conductor knows the bridge is rotten wouldn't the engineer know, too? Why doesn't the conductor simply pull the emergency signal? Why . . . oh, never mind.)Except for the photography, which is rather good, the film, which opened yesterday at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, carries out its ridiculous premises with uniform incompetence.Burt Lancaster bears his totally incomprehensible role as if it were a toothache.

us,'Fellini's Casanova' Is New Revel,"The initial sequence says it all. It is carnival time in Venice. Fireworks are raining down on the citizens, the young and the old, the beautiful and the misshapen. Suddenly, with the help of an elaborate system of weights and pulleys, the giant head of Venus begins to emerge from the Grand Canal. The crowd cheers as the master of the revels extols the goddess of love. The head rises creakily to eye level and a cable breaks. Slowly she sinks back into the dark waters. A mother screams to a child, ""Cross yourself!""Using as his text Giacomo Casanova's ""The Story of My Life,"" Federico Fellini has created another revel of a moviespectacular, but singularly joylessthat has the effect of celebrating the absolute end of romance and eroticism. There's nothing left but sex, and sex is a terminal disease. Love is a placebo.""Fellini's Casanova,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1, is much less about the self-proclaimed 18th-century philanderer, his life and his times, than it is the surreal, guilt-ridden confessions of a nice, middle-class Italian husband of the 20th century. This fellow, on reaching middle age shortly before the sexual revolution, is still tormented by fantasies that seem to him to be wicked and to the rest of us merely exhausting.I don't know how else to interpret this strange, cold, obsessed film, which I find fascinating, because I find the man who made it fascinating, a talented mixture of contradictory impulses, and as depressing as an eternal hangover. Other people, less convinced of the Fellini genius, may be driven up the wall.With ""Juliet of the Spirits"" in 1965, Mr. Fellini seems, in retrospect, to have entered his Roxy Theater-Radio City Music Hall period by making a series of films in which he has steadfastly insisted on giving the customers more than their money's worth of movement, color, sound, light, costumes, dcor, specialty acts, sideshow freaks, quick changes and dazzling, theatrical artifice.""The Clowns"" and ""Roma,"" documentary variations on themes close to Mr. Fellini's heart, were virtually meditations upon his methods. In ""Amarcord,"" his best film since ""8,"" the superabundance of style was given purposeful shape by benevolence and good feelings.""Fellini's Casanova"" recalls ""Fellini's Satyricon."" Though its concerns are narrower, it's as otherworldly as that nightmare vision of the pre-Christian Roman Empire. Like that film, too, ""Casanova"" makes no attempt to recreate an identifiable era, but, rather, to create a completely subjective impression.Nothing is real. Mr. Fellini, who now works exclusively within a studio, creates everything himself. The studio is the locus of his interior world. It's not for him to go on location to shoot a tree or a sky when he can choose the sort of tree or sky he wants from the scenic designer. Never for a moment does he ask us to believe that any tree or sky ever looked this way, only to understand that this is how he feels about them.Now, in ""Casanova,"" Mr. Fellini has gone one step further by, in effect, constructing his leading actor. He has molded the features of Donald Sutherland, who plays Casanova, much as if he were constructing a set, adding an imperial forehead and extending the nose and chin so that no matter how the actor turns, no matter how he is photographed, they define a grotesque absurd condition.In one of the more chilly sequences of the movie, Casanova becomes infatuated with a beautiful, life-sized mechanical doll, which he takes to bed with him. The always chastely, almost prudishly photographed sexual encounter that follows has no more, or less, meaning than any of Casanova's other affairs. It's all close-ups of Casanova's sweating forehead, accompanied by panting of the sort that suggests a critical shortness of breath. In these encounters, the orgasm is a death rattle.The closing image of the film is the aged Casanova dreaming of his youth, dancing with this mechanical doll across the frozen waters of the Grand Canal, where, below the ice, we can see the head of Venus with its empty eyes.The image is daring and beautiful, but it is repeating the film's single note for one more time than is easily supportable. Like ""Satyricon,"" ""Casanova"" has the form of a frieze that ends by meeting itself where it began. With the exception of a casual reference to Casanova's father, and a sequencethe best in the filmin which he runs into his aged mother in Germany, Casanova is less characterized than he is presented as if he were someone in a pageant.""Fellini's Casanova"" is a Dispassion Play that inventories Casanova's conquests, one after another, in Venice, Paris, London and the courts of Germany, as his lechery leads him to lonely, cranky old age.There is, I'm afraid, a terrible puritanism at work here, for though the film is often witty, it is without much humor. There's one curious moment when Mr. Fellini has Casanova defend the intelligence and strength of women, and another in which the director shows us that poor Casanova is as much the faceless sex object to his mistresses as they are to him.The production is gigantic, but the ideas and feelings are small. One longs to go home and listen to Mozart's ""Don Giovanni.""",1977-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Thieves,' Gulliver Among Brobdingnagians","A film comedy is a windup toy that performs, when released, at its own eccentric and quirky gait. ""Thieves,"" an expensive-looking romantic comedy, is like a windup toy whose movements are being forced by a jaded and impatient child.It has some good notions, some good jokes and some good performers. But, with rare interludes, it is wrenched and graceless. It seems to be made for an audience whose humor and emotional receptiveness have gone deaf and astigmatic. It shouts and writes extra-large; we feel like Gulliver among giggling and sighing Brobdingnagians.A dozen years ago Herb Gardner wrote ""A Thousand Clowns,"" a play that became a movie. It was about the comic and successful effort of an eccentricplayed by Jason Robardsto live in a pleasantly nonproductive manner with his nephew and a social workerBarbara Harriswho came to reform him and stayed to join him. It was sometimes preachy and longwinded; but, in general, it was a winning and very funny defense of nuttiness in the big city.With ""Thieves,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater, mr. Gardner has tried to do the same thing. He even uses a ukulele, once again, to pluck out the musical theme. His kook, this time, is a woman and she is played by Marlo Thomas. The descending distance from ""Clowns"" to Thieves"" is as the distance between Mr. Robards, who mostly surmounted the squashy bits, to Miss Thomas, who wallows in them and makes them bigger.""Thieves"" starts with an enormous East Side apartment house. It is nighttime and the camera scoots along the windows while the microphone picks up a collage of rich urban murmuring, largely having to do with sex and lack of purpose. We go through a window. It belongs to Martin Cramer (Charles Grodin), principal of a flossy private school, and Sally Cramer (Miss Thomas), teacher at a public, slum school.They've been married 12 years; their fortunes are rising and their morale is sinking. He is not the fearless and funny young rebel he was when they married. She is; and to prove it she wakes him up nights and asks what his name is. Furthermore, she has just sent all their valuable furniture away to be stored in the one-room cold-water flat they first lived in.They argue, she walks out, she comes back a week later because she has decided to have an abortion, they argue some more, she walks out again. This time she goes to the apartment of an admirer and they discuss their way into bed. Next morning she is up at dawn and off to see her septuagenarian, taxi-driving father. This father, played by Irwin Corey, is a boorish, loud-mouthed street philosopher. He comes on with the effect of 10 fingernails scraping a blackboard.The husband, meanwhile, has slept with a lonely neighbor but doesn't like it. He goes back to the Lower East Side to visit the furniture, finds it's gone, has a brush with some policemen and two bums, and returns uptown. Filled with rediscovered romance, he rejoins Sally and fires off a pistol in the air to prove he is no longer stuffy, they join hands and run twinkling up the street.The ukulele plays.There are some good, parodic touches in the film. One of Sally's small pupils steals a set of passkeys and a hand-truck and collects typewriters and television sets from every apartment in the building to offer to her. In exchange, he proposes, she is to let him pass into the seventh grade. There is a doorman who does nothing but sleep, or seems to: In fact, he's dead.The best character in the film is a mournfully choleric downstairs neighbor who is being beaten into anomie by noise, soot and urban discomfort. Hector Elizondo plays him beautifully. As Martin Cramer, Mr. Grodin is fairly characterless, but considering some of the lines he has to say, this may be a virtue.The other day John Leonard mentioned a German author who wrote delightedly that cats have two holes in their coats coinciding neatly with their eyes. Miss Thomas has holes in her skin for eyes and mouththose devices used by actors for expressiveness. But the holes don't coincide: they are much larger.""Thieves"" has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). The symmetrical adulteries of Sally and Martin, though not actually shown, are probably responsible.",1977-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Sentinel,' Less a Horror Film Than Dull","If the movie industry is going to go on turning out works about Satanism, perhaps some of the larger film schools should consider adding a course in Theology, or at least Pastoral Protocol.It is the kind of nagging thought that arises at a viewing of Michael Winner's ""The Sentinel,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli, Columbia II and other theaters.Nagging thoughts are not supposed to arise in horror pictureslast summer Mr. Winner predicted that this picture would be extremely horrifying  but ""The Sentinel"" has long stretches where there is nothing to do but notice things.For example, the film's thesis is that there is a tiny unplugged passageway to Hell in Brooklyn Heights. The Roman Catholic Church periodically chooses, by lot, some unfortunate nonvolunteer to sit by the hole and make sure the devils don't get out.I'm not saying that this is totally impossibleunlikely, of course, but not impossible. There are a lot of holes in Brooklyn Heights. But the film shows us an assemblage of what look like cardinals and canons-major meeting to choose the next nonvolunteer: in this case a New York fashion model played by Cristina Raines. We all know that such decisions are not made by the top brass but by strange old priests on pension in Cape May.Then again, the inscription on the chink comes from Dante. It is the line about ""abandon all hope ye who enter."" Now it is not generally held that Dante actually visited Hell. He stayed around Florence, pretty much, and worked from second-hand reports. What is quite certain is that he never got to Brooklyn.Are these pedantic objections, considering Mr. Winner's strenuous effort to remind us of ""Rosemary's Baby""a magnificent old apartment, a hopeful young couple, sinister neighbors and so on? The point is he has not given us much else.There is Miss Raines as Alison Parker, looking sicker day by day. There is her crooked lover, Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) and just whose side he is on isn't clear until the end, and then he switches. There is a great deal of latex and makeup.The film's plot need not be revealed much further, other than to say that it is a struggle. On one side is the Church trying to get Alisonwho has rented the apartment simply because it has a nice view of New Yorkon the job as the sentinel. On the other side are a lot of devils, in the form of reincarnated murderers, who try to persuade her to kill herself first.This is where the latex comes in. At first, the devils simply take the form of odd neighbors. As the movie goes on, they reveal their real shapesgaping wounds, absent noses, melted features and so on. Her own father, an unpleasant man given to orgies in the upstairs bedroom, is one of the gang.The confrontations are supposed to be terrifying but the most they offer is some mild creepiness. Miss Raines does a pretty good job as the distraught woman in a no-win situation. Mr. Sarandon and actors such as Burgess Meredith and Sylvia Miles, who are devils, drop by to collect their pay. Mr. Winner has sweetened the mess with some nudity, a little masturbation and a dash of lesbianism.",1977-02-12T05:00:00+0000

Berlin not only survived World War II and the Cold War era but continues to thrive under duress. The war left the city in ruins, with 80 percent of its housing and public buildings damaged or destroyed. Life postwar EastWest conflict wrenched Berlin in two, the strife culminating in the erection of the Wall, that modern anachronism of barbed wire and concrete, as the dividing line between West Berlin, showcase and Western outpost, and East Berlin, capital of the Communist German Democratic Republic. Since the Communist sealoff in 1961, West Berlin has been ringed by a 100mile perimeter of fences, wire and border fortifications, with just a few outlets for travel. But in the five years since the Big Powers concluded their Berlin pact, tensions have gradually subsided and the city has ceased being one of the world's perennial trouble spots. Berlin affords, tourists the opportunity of seeing East and West almost at a single glance. Visits to East Berlin from the Western half are possible and worthwhile. Firsttime visitors need valid passports, and the East Germans have since the beginning of this year required tourists to obtain visas on crossing to East Berlin. Visas are available for $2 at the border checkpoints. No visas are required for Americans or other Westerners*entering West Berlin.",1977-02-20T05:00:00+0000

As in the past, it did not have enough seats in Parliament to form a majority and, once again, had to woo smaller political entitles to form a coalition Government.

Born in Auvergne, France, in 1881, this gifted and distinguished paleontologist participated in the 1930's digs and discoveries of the Peking Man. He got along well with his secular fellowscientists but left most of them variously confused or disturbed by his persistent religiosity and his odd theories about a kind of qualitative, spiritual evolution. A man of great social, grace, he was lionized by hostesses in Paris, Peking and New York; but he managed to keep the look and temperament of an ascetic. He could not be called a happy manforbidden by his superiors to publish his life work and condemned by an uncomprehending theological bureaucracy to virtual exile from his beloved Paris. Yet he communicated a remarkable kind of serenity to those around him, wherever he was.

us,Film: History of Newsreels,"THE NEWSREELS died on American screens in 1967, but they were in poor shape for 10 years or so before that. There was no way they could compete with television news footage, either in speed or convenience. Nor, generally speaking, in quality. Most of the time they were patchy views of a rather scatterbrained reality. Sneezing contests would alternate with politicians cutting ribbons and South Americans rioting.But once in a while there was something unforgettable: the Hindenburg floated loftily into sight and suddenly settled on the ground like burning tinsel; a middle-aged Frenchman wept at Toulon when the fleet was scuttled. The newsreel cameras and the big screen provided an authority to these things that television equipment couldn't manage. Also there was the effect of waiting a day or two to see a disaster you had read of. World events were discrete, individual, weighty. They did not flood us.A diffuse, somewhat unsatisfactory but reasonably interesting retrospective of newsreels in America is provided by ""Yesterday's Witness,"" which opened yesterday at the Film Forum.Starting with the logos of the different companiesthe Warner-Path rooster, the globe circled by the word ""Universal,"" the Paramount cameraman standing in profile and turning his camera to the audienceit goes on to show the newsreel's history and format.Some of the footage is worth remembering. There is the sinking of the United States gunboat Panay by the Japanese in the 1930's. A cameraman was aboard and got the whole thing. There is the execution of a Cuban by firing-squad, again in the 30's; and a lovely scene of Bess Truman trying unsuccessfully to break a champagne bottle on a new airplane.The film does not try to show the best footage, however. It tries for a mix of the devastating and the trivialas any ordinary week's newsreel might have shown. The result is authentic, but sometimes tedious.Intercut with this are interviews with the old, organ-toned commentators, and with some of the principal cameramen. Unused footage from the crash of an airplane into the Empire State Building shows the charred bodies inside the office where the plane struck. After it we are shown a touching interview with Max Markman, who was the photographer. He breaks down recalling the scene and mutters ""Cut, cut,"" as the camera captures his tears.There are several short items on the same program. One is a take-off on the newsreel style. Called ""The Ritz Newsiola,"" it is funny for a few minutes, but turns fairly pointless. There is a tiny film about a rudimentary portable movie projector in a Pakistani market; and one about a mobile movie-showing team in Cuba.",1977-02-25T05:00:00+0000

There is, an Amin spokesman said yesterday, no problem regarding the Americans here. Perhaps Americans would see no problem either, were they as inured as Ugandans must be by now to intimidation, disappearances, mysterious killings or crocodile tears over improbable auto accidents. To us, it looks as President Amin is holding some 200 United States citizens as hostages in his country, even if only for a few days. That is very much a problem.

us,"Hot Time on Ice, Newman's 'Slap Shot'","Charlestown is a middle-sized New England mill town where things are going from bad to worse. The mill is laying off 10,000 workers and the Charlestown Chiefs, the city's professional hockey team, once a source of pride, has become a third-rate club in a league of the second rank. Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman), the team's player-coach, is getting old and feeling it. He knows it's his last season. He's about to be junked.Things are so bad that at one point we overhear the Chief's manager, Joe McGrath (Strother Martin), trying to unload some of the team's equipment, including its massage table. The Chiefs are nice guys. Though they don't win many games, they play clean and only talk dirty.George Roy Hill's unruly, funny new comedy, ""Slap Shot,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, dramatizes the age-old contest between good and evil as clean vs. dirty, and it's dirty that wins, hands (and pants) down.""Slap Shot,"" which follows the fortunes of the Chiefs through their last, dizzy season, was written by Nancy Dowd, a Smith College graduate with a master's degree from the University of California School of Cinema Arts. She's a young woman who appears to know more about the content and rhythm of locker-room talk than most men.She knows the favorite word that can be used as a noun, verb or adjective, sometimes all in one sentence. She also knows the favorite sexual image that haunts the language of these hockey players as if all living had been reduced either to committing a sexual act or to preventing one, which is more or less a reflection of what the guys are doing out there on the ice with their hockey sticks and the puck. If you don't invade the enemy territory, the enemy will invade yours.I don't know enough about professional hockey to judge how accurate a picture ""Slap Shot"" is, but it does seem a stretch of the imagination to ask us to believe in this day and age, that neither the Chiefs' manager nor coach would have known that a dirty, violent game, accompanied by a lot of publicity hoopla, would bring in the crowds. Which is pretty much what happens to the Chiefs, first by accident, then on purpose, as the team goes onward and upward to the top of the league.The film's point of view also appears to be ambiguous, for though it seems to want to be on the side of the clean, old-fashioned game, played by the rules, ""Slap Shot"" itself, like the Chiefs, largely triumphs by exploitingsometimes uproariouslythe brutality of the game and the protective vulgarity of the players.Mr. Hill, a director of real sensibility, is certainly aware that people as thick-headed and slow-witted as are most of these characters aren't very interesting when seen in close-up for very long. Seen as a collective spectacle in a long-shot, though, they make a sometimes bitterly comic comment on one aspect of the industry that is professional American sports.The performanceswhich have a lot to do with the right casting, particularly in the smaller rolesare impeccable. Paul Newman maintains an easy balance between star and character-actor. The leading-man authority is there, but it's given comic perspective by the intensity of the character and by its tackiness, evident even in the clothes he wears.Michael Ontkean, a young actor I've not been aware of before, is equally good as the film's one unequivocal good guy, a Princeton graduate turned pro, which may be one of the nicest things Hollywood has said about the Ivy League in years. Jennifer Warren, who was so good in Arthur Penn's ""Night Moves,"" plays Mr. Newman's estranged wife, a self-reliant beautician, and Lindsay Crouse is seen as Mr. Ontkean's heavy-drinking wife, a role that doesn't make too much sense as written.There isn't space to credit all of the vivid supporting performers but, in addition to Strother Martin, you're likely to remember Jerry Houser as a goalie who thinks of himself as a mystic, and Andrew Duncan as a hilariously phony-talking radio announcer.""Slap Shot,"" which has been R-rated as much for its language as for the violence on the rink, has a kind of vitality to it that overwhelms most of the questions relating to consistency of character and point of view. Much in the manner of ""Network,"" you know that it's an original and that it's alive, whether you like it or not.",1977-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Before photojournalism the typical photographic portrait was carefully posed in the studio or some selected corner of the sitter's own environment.

Kaufman. Nevertheless, a cult of Progress can sometimes be found at opposite ends of the literary spectrum; just as certain avantgarde poets expect praise merely for breaking the molds of the past, so do certain sciencefiction writers.
