He performed autopsies on non-combatants to assess the diseases that GIs were exposed to, Dr. Kimball and his men tried to provide comfort to the death camp survivors. He said, ''Sadly that first day, all we were able to do was to help them to get warm. Food did not arrive until a few days later.'' Dr. Kimball was amazed at the vitality of the young babies throughout ravaged Europe. Noting while their emaciated mothers were suffering from malnutrition, their breast-fed babies were relatively healthy. When Dr. Kimball returned to the states, he settled in Evanston and Glenview, IL, Marthas Vineyard, MA. and later retired to Jacksonville with his wife of 61 years, Alicia Barber Kimball, who died March 15 of this year, in Jacksonville.

The cardoon is related to the artichoke and looks like celery you would not want to buy -- grayish, with a kind of matte finish. It tastes of celery and artichokes, with a hint of licorice. The stalks should be peeled and cooked before using in gratins, pasta sauces or grilled with a buttery glaze.

Now, new ones from Tangiers, Morocco, are completely glazed, but accomplish the same purpose with a tiny air vent for the escaping steam. They are also sturdier and have ridges in the dish to prevent food from sticking. The drawback is that the evaporation can happen too rapidly. ''Moroccan cooks put a sprig of thyme in the hole to reduce it,'' said Kim Koenig-Ouassil, above, with her husband, Rachid Ouassil. The couple sell the tagines at their Moroccan store, Sheherazade.

In the 110 years since, West Palm Beach has had its ups and downs -- and plenty of each -- but lately it has come into its own. It has flourishing historic residential neighborhoods, many dating to the early 20th century, and its downtown, popularly referred to as Clematis Street, offers shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. A stone's throw away is the new City Place, a complex of shops and restaurants that avoided the enclosed-mall clich by straddling city streets. And south of downtown is Antiques Row, with a variety of restaurants. The Row attracts a range of shoppers, from well-known decorators, who fly in from New York and Los Angeles, to avid bargain scroungers. Downtown Lake Worth is just seven miles from Clematis Street, and the two make perfect bookends for a trip.

Under Mr. Staples, Amey overstretched its balance sheet by bidding aggressively on new projects, including an effort to modernize the London subway system. But when Amey was unable to raise the 60 million ($95.6 million) needed to provide funds for the consortium that won the subway contract, it was forced to borrow money from the group's other two members, the Bechtel Group and Jarvis. Amey has said it intends to raise enough money by June to replace that temporary financing with its own funds. In December the company lowered its profit forecasts and wrote down the value of some assets. In October, Michael Kayser, the finance director, resigned after five weeks on the job.

A few weeks ago, this pattern began to take shape. The Ralians are led by a prophet, Claude Vorilhon, who says he encountered scientist-aliens in 1973 on a volcano crater in France. The aliens renamed him Ral; they told him that they had created earth people in their own (genetic) image, and they gave him a task. No, it was not to clone a human. That feat, which the group, without providing evidence, proclaimed a success on Dec. 27, simply illustrates a truth of the universe, as expressed in one of the organization's founding tenets: ''The created will one day become creator.''",2003-01-05T05:00:00+0000

It also recounts the survival of Lt. Cmdr. Charles M. Cooke Jr. and his crew from drowning, asphyxiation and chlorine gas poisoning. With the help of trapped crew members, William Grace, an engineer from the merchant ship General Goethals, created more than 160 holes in a 15-foot section of the stern that was above water with a sledgehammer, allowing all 40 men to be rescued.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Masters of the Keyboard,"''It was never my intention to turn my typewriter into a heroic figure,'' Paul Auster writes. ''That is the work of Sam Messer, a man who stepped into my house one day and fell in love with a machine.'' The charming STORY OF MY TYPEWRITER (D.A.P., $17.95) details the shared obsession of Auster and the painter Sam Messer with the writer's 40-year-old Olympia portable typewriter. Once state-of-the-art but now obsolete, Auster's well-used and oft-repaired machine has served him steadily, through more than a dozen books, and will continue to do until he can no longer find the increasingly scarce replacement parts and ribbons it requires. In more than 30 paintings and drawings, Messer demonstrates his fascination with the typewriter as an artifact and with the connection that he perceives between Auster and the mechanical tool of his trade. One fanciful painting, for instance, portrays Auster juggling the letters of the keyboard. Another depicts Spider-Man-like webs emanating from his hands and leading directly to the typewriter. Several provide a droll dramatization of Auster's daily writing routine; in these, a many-armed author simultaneously smokes, drinks, moodily puts hand to head in dour concentration, and all the while keeps typing away. But Messer's focus always remains on the typewriter itself, in paintings characterized by thick layers of bright, vibrant colors. Successive pages demonstrate just how many varied ways there are of looking at a typewriter, especially when painted in bold contrasting hues of white, yellow, purple, red, orange, and black. Messer, who teaches at Yale, displays a similar humor and affection in his Expressionist-flavored caricatures of Auster. The result of their collaboration is a whimsical delight Diane Cole",2003-01-05T05:00:00+0000

But a group of rebels, led by conspirators within the government's space program, plans to hijack the transport spaceship and replace the government's hand-picked colonists with 100 leading dissidents and their families.

Although he was a man of prodigious energy who was hardly sick a day in his life, Mayer Mechanic, D.D.S., died on Saturday, January 4, 2003, of complications from a sudden stroke. He was 85 years old. He attended University of Michigan, where he graduated with honors. He went on to do the same at Temple University Dental School, where he received a special award for pediatric dentistry. He served two years as a dentist in the US Navy during WWII. Dr. Mechanic was a third generation Patersonian, whose grandfather, Cantor Jacob Landman, founded the first Jewish cemetery in the Silk City. However after practicing dentistry in his hometown of Paterson for over twenty years, Dr. Mechanic moved his home and dental practice to Ho-Ho-Kus. There, while shifting his reputation as the gentlest dentist in Passaic County to the gentlest dentist in Bergen County, he also caught the real estate bug. He began moonlighting from dentistry with his wife Bernadine, who was also moonlighting from her automotive parts business. Together they formed a joint partnership called Maybern Realty and went from their first project of renovating a defunct supermarket into an IBM headquarters to building many other office buildings and retail centers in Ho-Ho-Kus and surrounding towns. Dr. Mechanic earned a reputation as a great landlord by treating his tenants more as friends than tenants. He would always pick up his rental checks personally, just for the opportunity to chat with his tenants, since he was ever interested in people and their businesses. He was also a famous storyteller and would regale everyone with wonderful stories about his own life and colorful stories about the depression era. In fact, he knew so many people in town from his years as a dentist, realtor and member of the Ho-Ho-Kus Chamber of Commerce that many people fondly referred to him as the ''Mayer of Ho-Ho-Kus''something he always joked about with the real Mayor, Rusty Thompson. Dr. Mechanic is survived by his beloved wife of 59 years, Bernadine Mechanic, and by his three children: Leslie, Jonathan and Louis. He is also survived by six grandchildren: Max, Suzanne, Karen, Marc, Adam and Ross. The family requests that any doantions be sent to: The Alzheimer's Association, 919 N.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  SWARTZBACK, RAYMOND H., REV.","SWARTZBACK - Raymond H., Rev., D.D. Pastor Emeritus First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, New York. Raymond H. Swartzback, 79, an urban pastor who was a champion for social justice and was active in the struggle for civil rights died December 14, 2002, after a brief illness. He was a man who loved Jesus, ''the man'', and genuinely loved people, preaching, and listening to other people's stories. Ray set about to make friends of his neighbors. In this he was aided and abetted by a rare and genuine ability to practice Christian love. ''When God says, 'love thy neighbor,' he means for us to love him no matter who or what he is. The whole Christian message becomes irrelevant unless we put into action these beliefs, we say with our lips.'' Ray was one of the first leaders of Urban Ministry. In 1975 he accepted a call to the First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, Queens, the oldest continuously worshiping Presbyterian congregation in the country. Prior to 1975 the membership of this church was 1500, but ''white flight'' had reduced the membership to 89 people. There was talk of Relocation, Abandonment, Sell-Out; however, that small band of members said, ''We will not be moved,'' and they opened their doors to the new immigrants who were moving into Jamaica, Queens. Today First Church Jamaica has a membership of over 800 from 33 birth nations. At the 333'rd Anniversary and Sanctuary Rededication in 1996 Ray counseled the congregation , ''Do not adopt a Sanctuary mentality. Do not allow this beautiful Sanctuary to become a place to play church, a soul gymnasium to practice spiritual exercises, but let it be a fueling station for involvement in the world out there.'' Mr. Swartzback was born in Baltimore, MD to John and Florence Swartzback. He graduated from City College, Baltimore, Maryville College, Maryville, TN, and McCormick Theological Seminary, Chicago, IL. Upon graduation from seminary in 1950 he was drawn to the churches of the inner-city. His first parish was a two-point mission field in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1956 he went to Calvary Presbyterian Church, Detroit, MI, a struggling congregation in a changing neighborhood. Here he trained eleven seminary graduate interns for work in urban ministry. Later he copastored Glenville Presbyterian Church in Cleveland, OH before going to Jamaica. During the Viet-Nam War years, he accepted a call to Westminster Presbyterian Church on the College of Wooster campus, where he extended his ministry to counseling students during those turbulent years. During WW II Ray served in Europe from 1942 to 1945 as a platoon leader of the 30th Division, 117 Infantry, where he received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Ray received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from Alma College, Alma MI, and The College of Wooster, Wooster, OH. He taught New Testament Literature at the University of Cincinnati, and for eleven years was a lecturer at the Presbyterian Institute on Industrial Relations at McCormick Seminary in Chicago. He has been identified with many ministerial, labor, and civic organizations. He is survived by his devoted wife Jane Hays Swartzback of 55 years, and three daughters Linda Pratt (Jeff) of Millersburg, OH; Carol Kirk (John) of New Marshfield; and Susan Quinones of Athens, and nine grandchildren. A scholarship fund in his name has been established at McCormick Theological Seminary, 555 S. Woodlawn, Chicago IL. The Celebration of his life will be held on January 11 at 4:00 p.m. at the First Presbyterian Church in Athens, Ohio. The Session and congregation of First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica thanks this fearless leader for his outstanding service to the church of Jesus Christ.",2003-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Most Jews emigrating are between 16 and 35 years old, and roughly two-thirds have college degrees, the agency said. The agency's director in Paris, Menahem Gourary, attributed the trend more to Jews' desire to assure the future of Israel than to increased insecurity resulting from a spate of recent attacks on Jewish sites. Last year, Jews were frequently the target of violent attacks. In recent days, a leader of the French liberal Jewish movement, Rabbi Gabriel Farhi, was stabbed and his car was destroyed by fire.

Siggi Wilzig was born in 1926 in Krojanke, West Prussia. He was forced into the Auschwitz concentration camp at 16 years old. After the war, where he was the only survivor of his Jewish grade school class of 1,500, he came to the U.S. in 1947. In 1965, he was elected President and Chief Executive Officer of Wilshire Oil Company of Texas. Under Mr. Wilzig's leadership, Wilshire acquired a large interest in The Trust Company of NJ. He became a director of the Trust Company of NJ in 1969, and two years later was elected Chairman and President. In January 2002, Alan Wilzig was elected President and Chief Executive Officer of The Trust Company of NJ.

Mendocino is a stage set of pioneer California, a cluster of low white frame Victorian buildings and old water towers nestled in the curve of a cove high above the crashing waves of the cold Pacific. Somewhere between a New England fishing village and an Old West frontier town, little Mendocino (population 1,200) looks much as it did in the 19th century, when it was a thriving logging town, shipping redwoods down to an expanding San Francisco. Today's visitors typically arrive after a drive through Sonoma and Napa Counties, with their vineyards, cheese- and snack-laden tasting rooms and many wines that cannot be found elsewhere. The last part of the drive to Mendocino is an exhilarating hairpin-turn coastal road through what remains of the ancient redwood forest, where huge evergreen trees obliterate the sky before opening suddenly onto a five-mile stretch of ocean road that leads directly into the village.

The name of the man, 17, was not released because of his age. He identifies himself as a female and is considered legally disabled; a psychiatrist said the diagnosis was gender identity disorder. The judge ordered the Administration for Children's Services to exempt the youth from male-only dress. Facility officials had argued that the women's clothing he wore was sexually provocative in an all-male environment. A spokeswoman for the children's services agency said yesterday that it had not yet received the decision but had already moved the youth to another facility, where he can dress as he likes.

Bulgaria agreed to a European Union demand to shut the No. 3 and No. 4 reactors at the Kozlodui power plant to avoid derailing accession talks last year. Ruling on an appeal brought by the opposition Socialist Party, the Supreme Administrative Court said the agreement ignored a vote in Parliament that the reactors should be kept on line until Bulgaria's entry into the European Union, planned for 2007. Brussels wants the reactors shut in 2006 for safety reasons, despite the fact that the plant produces half of Bulgaria's electricity. The government is likely to appeal the decision.

Passed away Thursday night after braving Parkinson's disease for over three decades. Mortimer Eugene Bader, M.D., worked his way from humble roots to lead a distinguished life and career. First in his class at both Stuyvesant High School and Columbia College, he was graduated with honors from Harvard Medical School. Sent to the Arctic by the United States Armed forces during the Second World War, he co-authored three landmark papers on the effects of cold environment on human metabolism. Following his return to civilization, he worked in the laboratories of Nobel Laureates Cournand and Richards, producing significant papers on the work of breathing. At 24, he began his career at Mount Sinai hospital, co-founding the hospital's first pulmonary function laboratory and continuing research and publication relating to collagen - vascular diseases, basic pulmonary physiology, and occupational lung disease. Renowned as a superb clinician and lecturer, he saved countless lives in his private practice with his twin brother Richard. Associate Editor of the American Journal of Medicine, Clinical Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and lecturer at the University of Bologna medical school, he was awarded the Jacobi Medallion for distinguished achievement in the field of medicine and extraordinary service to Mount Sinai Hospital in 1983. Not just a legendary diagnostician, he was a charismatic man with a generous heart and sweet soul who was deeply dedicated to his family. A devoted chess player, he once defeated a Russian grandmaster in a simultaneous exhibition; a lover of puzzles and games from backgammon to bridge, he regularly completed the Sunday Times of London Crossword in addition to other less challenging puzzles. Possessed of an exceptional memory, he was a lifelong student of languages, history, philosophy, and mathematics. He held fast to his ideals and always valued honor and wisdom. Selfless and committed always to doing the right thing, he was a dear friend to many, loving father to John and Jenny Lyn, grandfather of William and George, brother of Richard, husband of Pauline.

Since 1995 she has been Director of the Fryer Research Center, a healthcare organization that offers a biochemical-nutrional treatment for mental disorders. Her serious avocation was singing. She performed in a series of concerts at The National Arts Club in New York, the Amato Opera and in the Opera in Central Park. In her teenage years, Dr. Fryer was afflicted by a severe thryoid deficiency that went undiagnosed and nearly led to an early demise. After encountering little success in New York, a simple country doctor in Florida finally identified the problem and prescribed medication that saved her life. This ordeal became the subject of a book authored by her mother, and simply titled ''Kathy.'' Dr. Fryer is survived by her three sisters, Dr. Judy Shedden, a financial planner in New York City, her twin sister, Anne Eddis, a violinist with the New York City Opera, and Dr. Sarah Fryer Leibowitz, a Professor of Neurobiology at The Rockefeller University.

The curtain itself is a notch above ordinary -- a scrap of fawn-colored linen -- but the way the 22-year-old Williams studies it, you'd think it was the key to some faraway kingdom, a piece of a large and scintillating puzzle.

Nina wore new baby clothes for visits to her 16-year-old father, Toney, in a juvenile detention facility not too far from their Bronx neighborhood. As Nina grew, Lolli dressed her daughter for the rarer afternoons in faraway New York State maximum-security visiting rooms. The gaps between visits gave Lolli time to save and shop for the brand-new outfits on layaway. In the inner city, being ''dressed'' has always been important: it means you are provided for, a part of bigger things. Sloppiness and stains were physical evidence of failure, of poverty winning its battle against you. The night before visits, Lolli would spend hours doing Nina's hair in her father's favorite style -- Shirley Temple curls. Nina groaned and grimaced. Lolli tugged and yanked. Nina winced whenever Lolli cleaned her ears (Toney sometimes checked). In prison, as on the street, a well-dressed family enhanced Toney's stature.

A new ordinance sets aside about 2,500 spots that are reserved 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for holders of residency permits in this town of 38,000 people. But desperate parking-hunters are choosing to ignore the telltale green signs. Since enforcement began on Oct. 21, the town says, 800 cars have been booted, costing the owners $100 each. Not everyone agrees that the new ordinance is tough enough. ''People who come here to go out in the evening shouldn't get street parking,'' said Cregan Cooke, a resident since 1991.

A man larger than life itself, Dr. Leibman was dedicated to humankind and was instilled with empathy for all who touched his life. A native of South Africa, he emigrated after completing medical school at the University of Pretoria where he was an avid squash player. He saw an ad in the Lancet medical journal and took a oneyear position in New Jersey's Englewood Hospital. He met and fell in love with Felicia Lipchez of New York City. They were married that summer in Englewood. Theodore and Felicia Leibman returned to South Africa and settled in Klerksdorp where he maintained a general practice. The United States beckoned and they returned to New York City a few years later. His three brothers soon followed and settled in the Houston area. Dr. Leibman completed a residency in OBGYN at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He practiced on the faculty at that institution, but gravitated back to Englewood Hospital, where he practiced for many years. Dr. Leibman's son Michael joined his practice in 1999 and they worked together until his retirement in February of 2002. Dr. Leibman delivered thousands of children, and in many instances, the children of those children. One of his most gratifying experiences was volunteering his medical skills through the Indian Health Services. He served the Native American populations in Arizona and New Mexico. His interests included fishing and boating as well as collecting decoys, sculpture and Native American art. He was a longtime subscriber to the ballet and opera and enjoyed Broadway theater. His second home was Chamberlain, Maine, which always reminded him of the shores of Capetown, South Africa. A world traveler, he had recently completed trips to Antarctica, Portugal, fishing in Guatemala as well as the game reserves of his native South Africa. He is survived by his wife Felicia, three sons, Dr. Michael, Peter and Marc, three brothers, and daughters-in-law, and nine nieces and nephews.

us,Lugging the Dummy,"Never mind the pornographic passages that appear every few pages in 69 THINGS TO DO WITH A DEAD PRINCESS (Canongate, paper, $13); the British writer Stewart Home, champion of ''proletarian'' postmodernism (which means forget about character and plot), is a surprisingly easy read. The graphically described couplings are among the novel's many sendups, as Home sets out to undermine the role of books as commodity (another of his obsessions) with the sort of goings-on you can't describe without sounding foolish. For instance: the efforts of the main characters, Alan and Anna, to test the ''credibility'' (ha!) of an obscure text called ''69 Things to Do With a Dead Princess,'' whose author claims to have taken Princess Diana's corpse on a tour of the local Neolithic stone circles ''as a means of luring tourists to the prehistoric delights of ancient Aberdeenshire.'' The pair retrace the journey, lugging a ventriloquist's dummy as a princess stand-in. Between sex scenes, Alan sounds off on a range of authors, with charming disregard for their relative prominence or obscurity. Home makes an agreeably deadpan ventriloquist himself, venting intellectual spleen through his transparently thin characters. It's only when he points out the illusion -- having Alan disappear into Anna, or letting the dummy narrate a chapter -- that the joke falters, and his absurd picaresque reveals itself as that tamer thing, a novel of ideas.

Mr. Campbell had asked the group, the Metropolitan Television Alliance, on Dec. 12 to explain why it favored Bayonne.

The tower, which the alliance says would be the world's tallest free-standing structure, would replace antennas that stood atop the World Trade Center. The alliance says it would restore quality TV reception for about 700,000 people in the metropolitan area, including many poor and elderly, who do not have cable television, and would be a boon to construction workers in the region.

Tracy plays the title character, a sober, respectable Midwestern bachelor judge who marries a sexy, not entirely virtuous young blonde (Lana Turner) from the wrong side of town. Unfortunately, Timberlane's stuffy middle-aged friends have never heard of the trophy-wife concept (or just don't think it applies to a man's first marriage) and do not welcome her into their circle with open arms.

(He has since been reinvited.) Paulin is also famous for having led the attack on T. S. Eliot for his anti-Semitism -- he argued in a passionate review of a book on the subject that you can't separate the poetry from the poet's malignity. So do we read Paulin as he has read Eliot, scouring his poems for evidence of his hatred of Jews? Or do we disdain the journalistic trick of turning a writer's statements against his own work and entertain the possibility that Paulin is a misunderstood philo-Semite, as he says he is, whose poetry is on the whole sympathetic to Jews?",2003-01-12T05:00:00+0000

RadiSys, which is based in Hillsboro, Ore., makes equipment used in telecommunications switches and other products by companies including Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. The company has not made a profit since the fourth quarter of 2000, when sales were $82.5 million, compared with $47.9 million in the third quarter of last year. The company said 58 of the jobs will be eliminated because it is shifting more production to an outside manufacturer.

An economist and Southeast Asia expert who also advised the Saudi government in the 1970's, died December 10, 2002 at age 77. Dr. McHale was born on March 20, 1925, in Waterbury, Connecticut. He won a scholarship to attend Yale University, which he entered in 1941. In 1943, his studies were interrupted by World War II. Mr. McHale enlisted in the Naval Air Corps and served in the Pacific Theater, including the Philippines. Thus began a connection to the Philippines which lasted more than fifty years. After demobilization in 1946, he returned to Yale and finished his B.A. He was later awarded a doctorate from Harvard University in political economy in 1959. Dr. McHale's life and work spanned disparate worlds. He was a businessman (specializing in developing economies) who had a long connection to academia. He was an expert on Southeast Asia who also worked in the Middle East. He published books on rubber in Malaysia and (with his spouse) on Nathaniel Bowditch, who served on the first American vessel, the Astrea, to engage in trade with the Philippines.

Higher oil prices can dampen demand and make crude more costly to process. Slimmer margins at the oil-refining unit, which accounted for about two-thirds of BP's revenue last year, will be partly offset by wider margins at BP's drilling unit, which gains when prices rise, because it can charge more for the oil it pumps from the ground. BP's warning opens the door to the possibility that other large oil companies may see lower profits. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2003-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Slimmer margins at the oil-refining unit, which accounted for about two-thirds of BP's revenue last year, will be partly offset by wider margins at BP's drilling unit, which gains when prices rise, because it can charge more for the oil it pumps from the ground.

The copyright owners won, and yesterday they won again when the Supreme Court, by a vote of 7 to 2, decided that Congress was within its constitutional rights when it extended copyright.

Now a mally, sprawly city of 48,000, spawning suburban housing developments, it offers not only warmth and sunshine, but boating, beaches, spring-training Minnesota Twins and Boston Red Sox games, and a pedestrian-friendly downtown historic district with restored buildings and diet-busting restaurants. There are frequent downtown festivals, where retirees can impress their visiting families with their new outdoor lifestyle and rub shoulders with tourists and longtime Floridians. The largest is the Festival of Light, celebrating Edison's bulb, which began last week and runs through Feb. 15. For its big parade (Feb. 15 this year), people reserve viewing spots a week in advance along Cleveland Avenue by positioning their folding chairs, which no one disturbs.

And the governor now says that as many as 1,000 more state workers could face layoffs if the unions do not accept his package of concessions. Today's layoffs -- the last of the 2,800 that Mr. Rowland ordered in December -- mean that about 5 percent of the staff members of each state agency and department have been let go.

He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Yale University in 1965, receiving a B.A. in Italian Studies. Fluent in three languages, he had a passionate interest in Italian medieval and humanist literature, in particular Dante and Boccaccio, which inspired an impressive career as a scholar. In 1971 he received a Ph.D. from Columbia University, where he received the Woodbridge Distinguished Fellowship and a Fulbright Fellowship. After living in Milan, Mr. Wheelock joined the faculty of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and became the youngest department chair in the university's history. In 1980 he made a significant shift in his career, leaving academia to focus on real estate development, in particular historic preservation in the Capitol Hill section of Denver where he lived. Mr. Wheelock was also a founding board member of Opera Colorado and co-founder and board member of the Colorado Wagner Society. Mr. Wheelock returned to New York in 1986. After years of full-time volunteer work at the GMHC, he became Assistant Director of the Legal Department and then director of both Intake and Client Services. In 1996 he began JTSW Consulting, specializing in data management for not-for-profit medical organizations. Among his clients was the AIDS Institute of the New York State Department of Health, for which he developed, under the federal Ryan White CARE Act, an electronic records system to improve medical care and treatment for children with AIDS.

Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid, said that he and some other Polaroid specialists had mounted a letter-writing campaign to have the sale price re-examined. He said Polaroid had ''salted away money'' in its overseas operations by selling them film at very low prices, and then buying back instant cameras at very high prices. Mr. Yannas also complained that the profitable and debt-free overseas plants were assigned no value in the bankruptcy proceedings and that Polaroid had played down the value of its Massachusetts real estate. ''Their cash and receivables alone were worth more than $255 million,'' Mr. Yannas said. A Polaroid spokesman said the re-examination was a routine move as part of the bankruptcy. Claudia H.

For creatures so large, they are uncommonly graceful, not to mention sweet-natured, so it's gratifying to learn that a team of scientists, writing in the journal Science, has recently certified them as ''cultured'' as well.

A few miles away, in the stormy waters of the North Sea, William had at great cost and even greater risk assembled an armada of 225 ships, ostensibly to come to the rescue of his fellow Protestants in England. Winter was fast approaching, and with it the prospect that William would not only have to call off his invasion of England, but also leave his own country vulnerable to being invaded by the French. The following day, however, the storms that had been buffeting the Dutch fleet lifted; two days later William set sail; and four months later, with James II now in ignominious exile in France, William was crowned along with his wife Mary.

us,Take Another Madeleine,"''Around 7:30 a pale young man with doelike eyes would arrive at Weber's. . . . Pretty soon his lips would let fall, pronounced in a hesitant, hard-pressed tone, exceptionally refreshing remarks and diabolically accurate perceptions. . . . It was Marcel Proust.'' These observations come from the writer and bon vivant Lon Daudet, who, with other decadently ornamented figures, stares out at us from THE WORLD OF PROUST: As Seen by Paul Nadar (MIT, $34.95), a collection of photographs by Nadar, who in his fashionable portrait studio recorded the same aristocratic figures that Proust drew upon for his exquisitely etched characters in ''Remembrance of Things Past.'' The book was edited by Anne-Marie Bernard, who provides extended captions detailing each sitter's relationship to Proust and his prose. We meet, for instance, the possible model for the Duchesse de Guermantes in the several pictures taken between 1883 and 1900 of the Comtesse Greffulhe, whose beauty intoxicated Proust as it did the Comtesse herself, who wrote: ''I don't believe there is in the world a pleasure comparable to that of a woman who is aware she is the center of everyone's attention.'' There is also a shot of the resigned face of Proust's grandmother, recalling a description in the novel: ''Her cheeks . . . unconsciously assumed an expression of their own, livid, haggard, like the expression of an animal that feels that it has been marked down for slaughter.''

The Museum and especially its President and founder, Hon. Luis A. Ferre, lament the loss of this great collaborator and friend. He contributed to the creation and development of the Ponce Museum of Art for more than forty years, with his expertise and connoisseurship. Dr. Held shared with Hon. Luis A. Ferre, Puerto Rico's former Governor and philanthropist, the dream of establishing the first fine arts museum in Puerto Rico that would present to the public fine samples of European art. In 1962, Dr. Held's initiative made possible a donation to the Ponce Museum of early renaissance paintings from the Kress Foundation in New York. That same year he collaborated with the planning of the new building designed by renowned architect Edward Durell Stone that opened to the public in 1965. In 1967 he published the Museum's first catalogue, followed by the second in 1984, with the collaboration of Dr. Rene Taylor. His dedication to the Ponce Museum of Art was uninterrupted. Over the years he advised the Museum on the acquisition of the finest examples of European paintings, such as Rubens, Van Dyck, Teniers, Joos van Cleve, Luca Giordano, Murillo, Rivera, Claude Lorrain, Gerome, Vigee-Le Brun, Gainsborough, among others. He also was the reason for the Museum's fine collection of 18th and 19th century sculptures as well as an excellent Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood collection, renowned among the American collections. He was instrumental in achieving the Museum's 1987 AAM accreditation, making it the first museum accredited in Puerto Rico. In his last letter sent to the Hon. Luis A. Ferre, he expressed: ''tell me more about our museum,'' showing his undying devotion for this museum. We will never forget his love, passion, and hard work for the Ponce Museum of Art.

He was a loving young man who brought such immense joy and happiness into the lives of his parents and siblings. Michael had many dreams and did so much in his time here. At the early age of 12, he was already a master of four languages. Michael dreamed of being the best at all he attempted and always succeeded. His brothers and sisters loved him deeply, and he was the life of every party. Michael's intellect was surpassed only by his kindness. He changed this world for the better and will be greatly missed. In addition to his immediate family, Michael is survived by a loving extended family: his paternal grandparents, Arnold and Audrey Fisher of Pine Plains, NY, and Lyn and Jack Schwartz of Manhattan; his maternal grandparents, Vincent and Assunta Gerard of Marco Island, FL, formerly of Rutherford, NJ. Michael is also survived by his uncle Kenneth Fisher, his wife Tammy, and their children Crystal, Brittany and Joshua; his aunt Karen and Thomas Misisco and their children Jonathan, Nicholas and Dylan; his aunt Helene and Ted Brois and their son Brandon; his aunt Tina and Douglas Cuveron and their sons Douglas, James and Evan; his aunt Pamela and Terek ElGammal and their sons Omar and Adam.

us,Agassi and Venus Williams Advance," MELBOURNE, Australia, Jan. 21  It was clear midway through the second set on Tuesday that Sebastien Grosjean was in dire need of presidential intervention. Andre Agassi was slicing and kicking his serves with conviction; huffing along the baseline and smacking groundstrokes with the sort of been-there-won-that precision that just about always means corner-to-corner disappointment for the foil on the other side of the net. Perhaps only Bill Clinton could have saved the talented Frenchman. Not that Agassi likes that line of reasoning. He has always testily denied that the former American president had the slightest bit to do with Grosjean beating him in the quarterfinals of the French Open in 2001. But anyone who was in the stadium for that schizophrenic match had to view it differently. Agassi was up a set in Paris and cruising until Clinton arrived fashionably late in the front row of the president's box, and Grosjean then won the second set in a hurry. When Clinton stepped out for a few games, Agassi broke the Frenchman and rallied, only to lose his grip for good when Clinton returned. Even Clinton said he felt responsible (not always his specialty), but though the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam event he has yet to attend, he was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday, and though this match was not quite as straightforward as the score looks in newsprint, there was no external or internal force capable of keeping Agassi from his appointed round. That would be the semifinals, but there may be no good reason for him to stop there after his 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 dismissal of the 12th-seeded Grosjean, who did not serve well enough to keep the American at bay. Already in excellent physical condition, Agassi should be fresher than usual after playing precious little tennis over the last 10 days. He has lost just one set in five matches, two of which were mismatches: his 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 victory over Lee Hyung-Taik and his abbreviated encounter with Guillermo Coria, which was stopped because of Coria's sore feet after just 11 games. ""Getting through is the first priority,"" Agassi said. ""But getting through with fuel in your tank would be the second. That's where I feel like it's been a good tournament for me up to now: It's not so much that I haven't played at night, but that when I have got out there, I haven't spent any unnecessary energy."" It gets better for Agassi. Though it appeared he was on a collision course with No. 4 seed Juan Carlos Ferrero, who has beaten Agassi twice in three matches, Ferrero was surprised 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 in Tuesday's second quarterfinal by the unseeded veteran Wayne Ferreira of South Africa. Ferreira, just one year younger than the 32-year-old Agassi, has never beaten the American in 10 matches and has won only one set. ""He has a certain game that brings out the worst in me,"" said an otherwise delighted Ferreira, whose only previous Grand Slam semifinal was here in 1992. ""I do feel that I have improved my backhand considerably. I'm taking it a lot earlier. I'm more aggressive on it. I'm missing it a lot less, and that's always been a very, very big factor against him: that he has absolutely dominated me on the backhand side and given me no opportunities to hit any forehands."" Whoever wins will also have the benefit of two full days of rest before playing the final, while their opponent will have to make do with one. To summarize: tennis is a routinely surprising game, but the omens don't get much better than this for Agassi, and there is another good reason for tennis fans to cheer him on. He said that he and wife Steffi Graf have made a pact: If he wins this tournament, she will play mixed doubles with him at the French Open in May. Graf, the winner of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, has not played competitively since 1999. But then let's not get ahead of ourselves. The other second-seeded American in Melbourne has been nearly as efficient. Venus Williams arrived here with doubts swirling about her form and motivation in the wake of her younger sister Serena's dominant season in 2002. It remains unclear whether Venus has the game to restore family order, but after dropping the first three games of her opening match against Svetlana Kuznetsova she has still not dropped a set. She is still erratic, yet she is playing with enthusiasm, resourcefulness and sometimes startling power. In a sure sign of engagement, she is also externalizing her displeasure with her mistakes: a rare concession for the usually regal and self-contained Venus. On Tuesday, she had just a bit too much of everything for the tall and elegant Slovakian baseliner Daniela Hantuchova, beating the No. 7 seed 6-4, 6-3 and cracking a first serve that was clocked at 201 kilometers per hour: just short of her record of 205 kilometers set in 1998. ""I think right now it's all about power,"" Hantuchova said. ""Because I think my tennis is there, but it's just sometimes so fast that I can't do anything about it. I mean, especially the serve."" Venus will face No. 5 seed Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium in Thursday's semifinals. Henin-Hardenne shrugged off any emotional or physical side effects from her dramatic victory over Lindsay Davenport on Sunday, proving too forceful and complete for unseeded Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual and winning 6-2, 6-2. This is Henin-Hardenne's first trip to the semifinals here, and it looked most unlikely at 7-7 in the third set against Davenport when she fell to the ground in agony with leg cramps after a first serve. But after resting on Monday, she practiced lightly on Tuesday morning. ""I was a bit nervous this morning, because I was very tired, and I didn't feel the ball very good,"" she said. ""But in the match it was much better."" Agassi, seeded second this year, might not have felt the need to grace Melbourne with his presence until fairly late in his career - something he now says is ""one of my biggest regrets"" - but he has done his best to make up for lost tournaments. Tuesday's romp was his 19th consecutive victory in Melbourne Park, although he missed last year's event with a wrist injury. ""It's remarkable,"" Grosjean said. ""Both his physical condition for his age and his motivation, too. He's been on tour for years, and he's won everything and yet he's still finding new challenges. I think that's his real strength."" Perhaps Agassi's longevity is giving ideas to some of his contemporaries. If 31-year-old Younes Aynaoui defeats Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, there will be three players over 30 in the semifinals: quite a statement considering the increasingly physical nature of men's tennis. To make matters even more mature, Aynaoui, Agassi and Ferreira are all fathers of young children and are juggling those responsibilities with the nomadic life of a tennis professional. Agassi's son Jaden Gil is here with him and Graf; Aynaoui's two sons Ewen and Neil are home with his wife in Barcelona; Ferreira's son Marcus is at home with his wife in Berkeley, California. Agassi was winning Grand Slam events long before fatherhood, but both Aynaoui and Ferreira believe the change has helped them play more relaxed and effective tennis. ""My son has changed my whole attitude,"" said Ferreira, who was close to retiring in 1999. ""Before it was more of a life-and-death situation, and there was nothing worse than losing a tennis match."" He was expected to lose this one, but Ferrero, for all his speed and baseline talent, is still clearly a fragile character: witness his collapse in the final of last year's French Open. Though the Spaniard won the first two games of the first and second set, Ferreira immediately closed the gap and was able to more than hold his own from the backcourt when he wasn't slashing forward to volley away winners at the net. Eleven years later, Ferreira is an Australian Open semifinalist once more. ""When I was younger, I went to sports psychologists,"" he said. ""I read these books. I listened to these tapes. I listened to this person and did that and this. None of it ever really seemed to work. I haven't done anything in the last two years, and all of a sudden it's changed."" ",2003-01-21T05:00:00+0000

Simon Property had joined last week with Westfield America, which is controlled by the Australian mall owner Westfield Holdings, to make its latest bid of $20 a share, up from its previously rejected offer of $18 a share. Robert S. Taubman, the chief executive of Taubman Centers, reiterated yesterday that the company was not for sale. Simon Property and Westfield responded by saying ''that the Taubman board has offered no credible alternative to their $20 offer.'' Simon Property and Westfield are now counting on shareholder support for their bid in an effort to pressure Taubman Center's board to capitulate. Simon Property has also filed a lawsuit to challenge the way the Taubman family obtained its voting control, giving it the ability to block any deal.

The petition, signed by several lawmakers and organizations, was filed in June by Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. Unlike Mr. Brodsky, Mrs. Clinton does not advocate shutting down the plant, but she has said that state and federal officials and Entergy, which owns the plant, must take steps to ensure its safety.

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: A Gathering On Net Taxes,"Lawmakers and tax officials from more than 30 states have gathered in Tampa, Fla., in an effort to create a groundwork for setting taxes on Internet sales and services. R. Bruce Johnson, head of the tax commission in Utah, said officials intended to try to define, in legal terms, how digital products like downloadable music, movies and software and other Internet services could be fairly taxed while the Web continued to evolve. States would have to update their tax codes to accommodate e-commerce, and Congress and the White House would have to approve legislation before a plan to tax online sales could be carried out. Internet retailers have opposed such taxation plans. Congress passed a ban on Internet taxes in 1998, and legislation is pending in the House and Senate to extend indefinitely a moratorium on such taxes. Governors and state officials argue, though, that millions of dollars are lost in taxes every year to online shopping.",2003-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Casting Out the Inner Buppie,"The heroine of Benilde Little's ''Acting Out'' (Free Press, $23) has a problem, and it seems all too apparent what that problem is. When her real estate broker husband announces that he's leaving, Ina must figure out how to reconstruct a life that has come to revolve around car pools and the P.T.A. Initially, it's hard to empathize with her Buppie ennui. All Ina wants to do is ''go upstairs and get into my big, feathered bed, feel the smooth 380-thread-count sheets against my body,'' and that's before she reads about his new girlfriend in a gossip column. The revelation that she was once dedicated to photography, but gave it up when she married, suggests she'll go through a fairly straightforward process of reinvention. Soon, though, ''Acting Out'' loses its prefab momentum and Ina's journey becomes far less predictable. Little begins to really work the first-person voice, blurring time frames and verbal styles to evoke the inner world of a woman who has lost her core -- or, perhaps, never had one. In the novel's most arresting passages, Ina relates her lack of identity to her own family's history and the historical legacy of all African-Americans. Black people ''have to be somewhat self-defining, because accepting what the culture hands us is unacceptable,'' she muses. ''But some people can change the markers, change things around -- names, backgrounds and faces -- and fit into ruling society. . . . Simple as that, well, till you have to look in the mirror.'' Ina's journey may not look like much from the outside, but Little's expressive prose lends it substance. Etelka Lehoczky",2003-01-26T05:00:00+0000

Next month, Dippity-do, the iconic bright pink or blue hair gel, will rerelease its original formula, along with the new Dippity-do Techno, a tweaked version for teenagers ($2.99 at CVS). In the higher-end cosmetic arena, Delux Beauty named its Tintsticks, sheer lip colors for spring, after 50's waitresses -- Flossie, Darling, Dot and Betty. And Stila's spring makeup line is based on the corals and reds of the classic 50's palette. ''The 50's look is very appealing right now because it's so cinematic,'' said Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila.

Mr. Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1937 to Joseph and Yetta Schwartz. Raised in Williamsburg, he attended the New York School of Printing during his high school years. Upon graduation, he was awarded a full graphics arts scholarship which he chose to forego in order to support his family during his father's severe and protracted illness. He proudly took on this responsibility and landed a job at The New York Times where he would work in varying capacities for the next forty years, until 1996. His career at The Times began as a proof press operator and he would eventually move on to become assistant supervisor of the Cut Department in the Composing Room. His final years at The Times were in the Advertising/Production Unit. On May 24, 1964 Seymour was married to Elaine Negrin at the Parkside Plaza in the Bronx. Following their honeymoon in Miami Beach, Florida, the couple settled on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. On September 6, 1967 they were blessed with their first of two children, Joseph David. The family moved to CoOp City in the Bronx in February 1970, where a second son, Mitchell Brian, was born to them on July 25, 1972. In October 1989, the family moved to Riverdale, New York. Seymour Schwartz is survived by his wife, Elaine, and his two children, Joseph and Mitchell, as well as by his three grandchildren, Jake, Chloe and Benjamin.

us,'Interracial Intimacies'," Slavery constituted the principal backdrop against which whites and blacks encountered one another for over two hundred years, from the 1660s to the 1860s. The overwhelming majority of slave owners were white, and the overwhelming majority of slaves black. There was probably more black-white sex during this period than at any other time (thus far) in American history. Most of it was unwanted sex, stemming from white males' exploitation of black women-the subject of many pages to come.? But what about mutually desired sex or what I refer to as sexual intimacy? Some commentators insist that there can have been no such thing as sexual intimacy between a black enslaved woman and any white man-a slave owner or overseer or even a mere stranger-because mutually desired sex requires choice, a power denied to slaves by bondage. According to this view, slavery created an extreme dependency that precluded the possibility of chosen as opposed to unwanted sex. As a result, all of the sex that took place between enslaved women and white men constituted some form of sexual assault. Professor Angela Davis is among those who make this argument. Criticizing the notion that a slave woman could consent to have sex with a master, Davis maintains that ""there could hardly be a basis for 'delight, affection and love' as long as white men[,] by virtue of their economic position, had unlimited access to Black women's bodies.""; Proponents of this view are right to stress the cruel coerciveness of slavery. While the specifics of bondage varied widely over time and from place to place, the condition itself always endowed masters with despotic personal power over their human property.

us,Neck Warmers Lighten Up,"For women who are weary of last fall's milelong mufflers in heavy, hand-knit yarns, designers are providing warmth for the second leg of winter in less bulky crochet. The crocheted mufflers, which evoke the granny-made afghan blankets and potholders of yore, come in a variety of yarn weights and patterns, and serve as a transition into spring, when crocheted capes and tops will take their place. At Saks Fifth Avenue, delicate scarves by Sophie Digard have floral, circle (left) and petal-shape patterns in rich pastel wool ($175). A dark plum scarf by Justine Brooke (center) does away with fringe and tassels and sports a slit in one end through which the other end can be fed ($150 at Bergdorf Goodman). Henri Bendel offers protection in the form of an extralong neck warmer, which appears to have been inspired by crocheted potholders (far left, $148). At Barneys New York, there are leaf-pattern shawls by Yadi Knits in metallic pastel cottons ($395). And on the other end of the disposable-income spectrum, American Eagle Outfitters has put its fringed muffler of crocheted squares on sale. It rings in at just over $7 at www.ae.com.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  HUDSON, EDWARD JOSEPH","HUDSON-Edward Joseph, 98, born on March 13, 1904, died on January 23, 2003. A long-time resident of Houston, Ed Hudson was born to Marion Dooley Hudson and Wilbur E. Hudson in Newark, New Jersey, the youngest child and only son in a family of five children. In 1926 Mr. Hudson graduated cum laude from Stevens Institute of Technology from which he held Mechanical Engineering and Doctor of Engineering degrees. He founded Hudson Engineering Corporation in Houston in 1933 and operated the company along with Hudson Products Corporation until its merger with J. Ray McDermott and Co., Inc. in 1969. Mr. Hudson continued as Chairman of the Board of McDermott for five years until his retirement in 1974. Between 1940 and 1969, Mr. Hudson organized and headed various corporations primarily to construct, own and operate gas processing plants and pipelines. These included Distillate Production Corporation, Acadia Corporation, Egan Oil Purchasing Company, Carthage Corporation, and Port Processing Corporation, all of which were merged into Hudson Gas and Oil Corporation, and sold to Continental Oil Company in 1963. Mr. Hudson served on the boards of McDermott, TransOcean Oil Corporation, Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation, and Texas Commerce Bank. Mr. Hudson also developed and operated the Hudson Cattle Company on the Broken Triangle Ranch near Bay City, Texas, where he bred registered American Brahman cattle. While involved in ranching, Mr. Hudson also established a stable of thoroughbreds, and in conjunction with Lane's End Farm, he enjoyed breeding and racing horses in Kentucky. While successful in business, Mr. Hudson pursued many other interests. New York was among his favorite cities. During the late 1940's to 1970, Ed Hudson was a generous contributor to the New York City Ballet. He was among the early and avid supporters of George Balanchine and Barbara Horgan. He served as a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and he was an active participant in building the Republican Party in Texas. He spent many years flying his own Beechcraft airplanes. He enjoyed backgammon and baseball, and he loved birds, gardens and flowers, particularly orchids. Through his life, he was blessed with remarkable good health and energy, and until age 98 he continued to visit his office each day where he managed his post-retirement interests. Ed Hudson's commitment to learning never wavered; he was an enthusiastic and generous contributor to education. Along with supporting Stevens Institute, he and his wife founded the Edward J. and Josephine G. Hudson Endowed Scholarship Fund at Baylor College of Medicine. To date the Hudson Scholarship fund has sponsored the training of more than 24 physician scientists through graduate and medical school. He also supported numerous other charitable organizations. Mr. Hudson is survived by his beloved wife, Josephine Gill Hudson, his two sons, Edward Joseph Hudson, Jr. and his wife, Lynne, of Houston, and Robert Lee Hudson and his wife, Becky, of Napa, California, five grandchildren, Sarah Hudson of New York, Wilhelmina Hudson of Houston, Edward Joseph Hudson II, Claire Hudson, and William Campbell Hudson of Napa. He is also survived by his three stepsons, Christopher Gill, Peter Gill and Richardson Gill, and their families, all of San Antonio, by Stacy, Wade and Colin Head of Houston, and by his nephew, Edward Joseph Toohey, and his wife, Phyllis, of South Hampton, New York. Mr. Hudson is mourned and will be missed greatly by his staff at home, Michael Lance and Victoria Loehr, and by his office staff, Cynthia Hughes, Mary Harris, Janette Burch, Lynn Einkauf and their familiies. The Hudsons wish to thank Dr. Michael DeBakey, Dr. George Noon, Dr. Mohammed Attar, Dr. John McCarthy, Dr. Peter Jones and the exceptional nursing staff of the CICU at Methodist Hospital for their dedication and loving care. A memorial service will be held for Mr. Hudson at St. Martin's Episcopal Church, 717 Sage Road, Houston, Texas on Monday, January 27 at 2 P.M. The Reverend Doctor Laurence A. Gipson will officiate. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Edward J. & Josephine G.

So it seems only fitting that in his final case, in Bartholomew Gill's DEATH IN DUBLIN (Morrow, $24.95), he should take on ''the most culturally heinous crime possible in Ireland,'' the theft of that medieval talisman of Irish civilization, the Book of Kells, from its place of honor in the library of Trinity College. All the evidence points to the New Druids, an anti-Christian, neo-pagan group of zealots who promote ancestor worship and maybe do a little drug dealing on the side. But McGarr is too wise to the defiantly contradictory Hibernian character to settle for the obvious; and indeed, the political plot proves more devious and its resolution much bloodier than anyone could have predicted.",2003-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Love Is an Engineered Thing,"It doesn't have quite the romantic grip of ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' but a new book on 35 historic bridges over the Delaware was no less fervently inspired. The author, Frank T. Dale, 77, an Essex County native, says in a forward to ''Bridges Over the Delaware River: A History of Crossings'' (Rutgers) that his ''principal and most rewarding inheritance'' is a love for these bridges. The book, $47 cloth and $19 paperback, is expected in stores in March. Divided into ''Downriver,'' ''Midriver'' and ''Upriver,'' it describes the original construction and subsequent lives of the 35 bridges, some dating back almost two centuries. The Riegelsville suspension bridge (pictured), more than 100 years old, is a successor to a wooden covered bridge built in the 1830's for $18,900. . Mr. Dale, a local historian specializing in Warren and Sussex counties, says he favored those old covered bridges. But the last of them over the Delaware was swept away in floods long ago. The most heavily trafficked Delaware bridge, at the Water Gap, is too new (1950's) to be called historic. Mr. Dale began crossing his beloved Delaware as a child, to visit relatives. He is still doing so, about 100 times a year. ''I crossed it today,'' he said last week. Kris Wells",2003-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Struggling Canada Looks for Answers," The last time BRUCE WILSON wore a jersey sporting a red maple leaf was also the last time Canada played in a major international tournament. The date: June 9, 1986. The place: Irapuato, Mexico. The result: a 2-0 loss to the Soviet Union. Canada went home after three losses in the first round without scoring a goal. Wilson went home to western Canada, where he has since been the men's coach at the University of Victoria. Wilson was once considered a candidate to coach the national team right after that World Cup, when Tony Waiters stepped down. He would probably like to be considered again, particularly after Canada's dismal 4-0 loss to the United States on Jan. 18. (Next up for Canada is a trip to Libya for a game in Tripoli on Feb. 12.) The generally opinionated Wilson was careful to measure his words, to a point. ``It's tough because there is nothing for our players at home,'' Wilson said, echoing recent comments by the current coach of the national team, the German HELGER OSIECK. ``The coach does not have a deep pool of players he can count on.'' Canada's largely developmental squad was without European-based players like TOMASZ RADZINSKI, who plays in England with Everton, and JASON DeVOS, also in England with Wigan of the Second Division. But perhaps the worst slap in the face was the decision by OWEN HARGREAVES (Bayern Munich) several years ago to play internationally for England, not Canada, where he was born to an English father and a Welsh mother. ``The reason for Canada's success when I was playing was the North American Soccer League,'' said Wilson, who played for Vancouver, Toronto, Chicago and the Cosmos during his 14-year professional career. ``Now with M.L.S., Canadians are considered foreign players, so our best players go overseas, where they can get a bit more money. I have to give M.L.S. credit. They don't want Canadian teams, and they have said they want to help develop American players. They have been brilliant. In the N.A.S.L., Canadian and American players were equal. It was super for us.'' Only one Canadian, DWAYNE DeROSARIO (San Jose), plays in Major League Soccer, which has considered expanding to Canada but has yet to find suitable investors. Several Canadians play in the A-League, the second-tier operation that has clubs in the United States and Canada. Canada did not qualify for the 2002 World Cup and will probably have a better chance in 2006 since the Concacaf region could have four teams in the tournament. Canada is currently ranked 70th by FIFA, tied with Jordan, one place behind Venezuela, one ahead of Cuba _ hardly world-beaters. Canada's only claim to modest success was winning the 2000 Gold Cup, but only after it advanced past the first round by the toss of a coin. ``Winning the Gold Cup was really such a nonevent,'' Wilson said. ``By the reaction from some people, you would think we had won the World Cup. Being the national coach was a big issue for me at one time. Maybe it is again, I don't really know. But I don't understand how a coach fails to take a team to the World Cup and gets a new contract. Anywhere else in the world he would be gone.'' ",2003-01-27T05:00:00+0000

In what is becoming a major trade war, American catfish farmers have persuaded Congress to bar Vietnam from using the name catfish for their exports and then filed the suit that led to yesterday's decision by the Commerce Department. For their part, the Vietnamese have condemned the suit as ""an unfair, protectionist act"" and a violation of the new trade agreement with the United States. They said their fish were priced lower because Vietnamese labor costs far less than American labor. In the last three years, Vietnamese catfish exports have soared from $13 million to $55 million, capturing 20 percent of the American market. A final decision is expected in June.

The murdered haulers had been credited with helping the authorities break a Mafia stranglehold on the Long Island garbage industry. The fugitive, Frank Pearl Federico, 75, disappeared in 1993, shortly before he was scheduled to provide blood and hair samples for comparison with samples found where the garbage carters, Robert M. Kubecka and Donald Barstow, brothers-in-law, were fatally shot. Yesterday, the authorities said that it was not clear where Mr. Federico, described as a soldier in the Luchese family, had been for the last 10 years, but that they believed he had spent time hiding in Europe. Mr. Federico was arrested in the Bronx, where he had planned to meet a former associate, officials said.

Issues Rules For Satellite Companies,"After more than two years of review, the Federal Communications Commission issued rules yesterday allowing satellite communications companies to set up land-based networks to carry their service in urban areas and indoor sites where satellite signals are obstructed. The agency also canceled the licenses of three small companies that had not met deadlines to construct satellites for proposed systems. It also reclaimed 30 megahertz of spectrum that had been assigned for satellite service but not used. That spectrum will be auctioned off to land-based cellular companies. The rules appear to be a victory for satellite companies like ICO Global Communications over the opposition of land-based cellular carriers like Verizon and AT&T, but the agency has not yet published crucial technical specifications covering devices like handsets. Such details, which could be delayed until next week, will affect the cost and convenience of any expanded satellite service. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2003-01-31T05:00:00+0000

The government decree also singled out prostitution and other antisocial offenses. The decree is the first public acknowledgment that some farmers were growing marijuana in the countryside. Although the government has always maintained that domestic drug use is lower than in surrounding islands, it has grown in recent years, at least partly because of Cuba's increased flow of tourists.

New Valley, an investment banking and real estate company, offered this month to invest $55 million in Globalstar. The financing would have given New Valley a majority stake in the reorganized company, with creditors including Loral Space and Communications Ltd. owning the rest. Members of the creditors committee, which represents holders of Globalstar bonds, indicated that they planned to provide debtor-in-possession financing, a Globalstar spokesman, Mac Jeffery, said in an interview. Globalstar filed for bankruptcy protection last February after spending more than $4 billion to build a satellite telephone network.
