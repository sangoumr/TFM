us,Screen: 'Virgin and the Gypsy' Opens,"""The Virgin and the Gypsy,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is an immensely romantic movie that minds its old fashioned manners with style and critical intelligence. It stars Joanna Shimkus, who has the face of a fair, slightly wacky Madonna, and Franco Nero, who has very black hair, intensely blue eyes and an insolent gaze, and it is the first feature film to be directed by Christopher Miles, a 31-year-old Englishman who knows exactly what he's doing. There's not a bad or really pretentious moment in the movie.The film is an adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence novella, published after the author's death in 1930, about a rector's independent minded daughter, Yvette, and the lower-class male, a spin-off from Lady Chatterley's confident lover, whom fate, in the form of a flash flood, turns into the instrument of her sexual emancipation.Although ""The Virgin and the Gypsy"" was apparently written near the end of Lawrence's life, it can be read as seminal Lawrence. The gypsy is little more than a spinster's daydream, described mostly in terms of what his loins and his hips are up to. (They are, variously, ""quick,"" ""alert"" and ""fine."" Yvette's spirit of rebellion, fed by some mysterious (at least, to Lawrence) desire to be sexually conquered by a male who can never be possessed, is not so different from Gudrun's in ""Women in Love,"" which the author began in 1913.At the same time, however, in ""The Virgin and the Gypsy"" Lawrence created a cast of complex, proper, inhibited middle-class characters, as well as a specific time (the mid-1920's) and place (North Country England) with an economy of exposition and dialogue that probably was out of reach of the younger writer.Miles and his screen writer, Alan Plater, have used the novella almost as if it were a scenario, and because the original is so direct and slim (120 pages), they have gotten most of it on film, with the exception of some ironies that separate the novella from more ordinary women's fiction.For a film whose narrative line depends largely on suppressed passion, hurt feelings and inarticulate longings, the movie is remarkably straightforward. Yvette and her older sister, Lucille (Harriet Harper), return from school in France to live at the rectory with their father, made impotent years before when his wife eloped with a younger man; their old-maid aunt, who eats a single potato at each meal, and their terrifying grandmother, who, when she isn't doing crossword puzzles or screaming for her Horlick's, is reminding the girls of the bad blood they inherited from their mother.The movie is one of lovely, funny vignettes of life at the rectory, of outings and country dances and amateur the-atricals, all punctuated by Yvette's fantasies about the gypsy, whom she has met, quite by chance, and who never exists in the movie as a character with a name, but only as a presence. A key difference between the novella and the film is that, at the end of the novella, there is every indication that Yvette will stay on at the rectory, quietly chipping away at pillars in the middle-class temple that confines her, until it comes falling down around her ears and her (by that time) bobbed hair. In the movie, she literally escapes.Miles never forces his presence on the film, shooting most of it in conventional long-shots, medium shots and medium close-ups, seldom using the sort of tight close-ups that might allow us to see the essential blandness of it all. The performances are completely true to the sense and spirit of the pieces, especially those of Miss Shimkus and of Honor Blackman as Mrs. Fawcett, Yvette's rich, outcast divorce friend who is horrified by Yvette's dreams of a gypsy lover. Mr. Nero has to glower quite a lot, and he glowers with conviction.""The Virgin and the Gypsy"" is satisfying because it realizes its goals, which are modest. I trust people will not stay away under the impression that it is, in some way related to ""The Lustful Turk.""",1970-07-01T05:00:00+0000

Arthur (Ken Howard) is tall, blond and very handsome, but aside from the fact that he has an occasional seizure and sort of lopes when he walks, you'd hardly know that he suffers from a progressive neurological disorder that is turning his body into mush.In some ways the most pathetic member of the trio, perhaps because he seems the most resolutely self-contained, is Warren (Robert Moore), a red-bearded, barrel-chested homosexual who likes to make brownies and to use words like ""divine"" to describe things on the order of swimming trunks. Warren has been confined to a wheel-chair ever since he was 17 when, during a hunting trip, he made a pass at a friend who promptly shot him in the spine.In the course of Marjorie Kellog's tiny, moving novel, Junie Moon, Arthur and Warren, abandoned by their families, their friends and, to a large extent, the world, discover self and love so quietly and unobtrusively that the reader feels he has made the discovery himself. In the film, based on a screenplay by Miss Kellogg, there is never any doubt that the process of discovery is being led by Preminger.Much like one of the dispassionate doctors in Junie Moon's state hospital, who displays his patients to visiting medical men without ever listening to the patients' complaints, Preminger displays his characters without ever revealing them, or letting them reveal themselves. In ""Junie Moon,"" the people never seem more important than the things Preminger places around them, like the hoot owl and the scroungy old dog Arthur befriends, or more important than the theatrical lighting, which makes real locations look like studio backdrops, and the clever techniques (flashback scenes are printed from unsqueezed anamorphic footage).This sense of display, which is not to be confused with visual spectacle, works quite well in movies of melodramatic event (""Hurry Sundown,"" ""In Harm's Way,"" ""Anatomy of a Murder""), but it is completely inappropriate for movies dealing with such private emotions as loneliness, embarrassment and suddenly recognized friendship. These things are difficult to see when you look at them directly; they have to be discovered out of the corner of the eye.Preminger doesn't direct movies as much as he makes frontal assaults on them. It's no accident that the most vivid moments in ""Junie moon"" are either the most cruel or the most bizarre, not because Preminger is cruel and bizarre, but because they fit into his melodramatic view of things. Junie Moon, shivering and feeling slightly silly, being forced to do a strip tease in a cemetery, in the dead of night, for a kinky boyfriend, while the soundtrack alternates between delicate Bach and something that sounds like old Stan Kenton.If anything, however, Preminger has been too sparing of our feelings. Miss Minnelli's Junie Moon is an exuberant, appealing misfit, but she really doesn't look very badly mangled (at one point in the novel Miss Kellogg describes her nose as a trench). Ken Howard's Arthur is so nice and healthy, if a bit shy, I couldn't believe he suffered from anything worse than a bad charley horse. By softening these edges, Preminger has, ironically, denied his characters the terror that is their right, and the affection that is ours.The most appealing person in the film is a beautifully commonplace fishmonger, played by James Coco, an aging bachelor who befriends Junie Moon and her friends and, much to his own surprise, falls in love with the very odd girl. I also liked Moore, who speaks his lines (fast, theatrically) like a director of Broadway comedies, which he is ""Promises, Promises,"" ""The Last of the Red Hot Lovers"").""Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon"" is not an unintelligent film, but it is so cool and ordinary that it almost made me nostalgic for ""Skidoo,"" which was epically bad but the obvious work of a brazenly gifted director.",1970-07-02T05:00:00+0000

Except for a few moments of Polanski's ""Knife in the Water"" and the lovely flotilla of Cal 20's that Preminger uses during the closing credits of ""Skidoo,"" I've almost never seen anything good about boating in a movie. And in general, despite world-shattering advances in the art and politics of the cinema, movie boating remains at the level of that 30-year-old masterpiece (I forget the name) in which Bette Davis takes her sloop into a storm and sails through several complete circles without ever jibing or coming about.Norman Tokar's ""The Boatniks,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld, isn't a good movie about boating, and it doesn't really try to be. It isn't good situation comedy either, though it does try to be. The only advantage of its assumed subject (weekend boating) and particular locale (Newport Beach and Balboa, a crowded southern California yachting inferno) is that there are a lot of small boats to look at to help you pass the time between the depositing and the withdrawal of each verbal or visual gag.""The Boatniks"" concerns a young Coast Guard ensign (Robert Morse) who does nothing right but who nevertheless wins a beautiful marina maiden (Stefanie Powers) and foils the overwater and underwater escape plans of three comic jewel thieves (Phil Silvers, Norman Fell and Mickey Shaughnessy).Along the way, he also enrages his commander (Don Ameche), resists the profferred temptations of an aging playboy (Wally Cox) and his sybaritic power cruiser, and alternately sinks and swimsalways with the aim of provoking the nervous laughter that in the view of the amusement brokers seems to pass for good clean fun.I'm sure that good, or at least bearable, movies have been made along the lines of ""The Boatniks,"" and probably with casts less competent than this rather attractive one. The trouble is not that Phil Silvers' dialogue, for example, consists 98 per cent of one-liners, but that they are such dull one-liners, so obvious and without sustaining wit.And the young lovers, who never make love; and the plot windfalls, which rarely make senselike the many humorless vignettes and all the plastic pleasure craft on Newport Baypoint toward that moment in mass production when the forms are still imitated, but the spirit has been lost.",1970-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,What's New in the Theater,"BOESMAN AND LENA, a play by Athol Fugard, was hailed by two critics, turned down by four and approved with reservations by four. Clive Barnes: Athol Fugard has written some fine plays, but certainly none better than the amazing Boesman and Lena, which on its opening instantly became the bestacted play in New York. In both The Blood Knot and in Hello and Goodbye, Mr. Fugard has suggested a more than common talent. In Boesman and Lena he is through suggesting: he is shouting from the roof. It is a strange, bitter, disturbing and, in a sense, beautiful play about human deprivation and human survival. Boesman and Lena are Cape Coloreds, neither white nor black, and fairly low down in South Africa's racial hierarchy. Mr. Fugard is constantly holding our atten tion with fresh insights into these two derelicts, making us care desperately, about them. John Berry's staging is wonderfully telling. Ruby Dee as Lena is giving one of the finest performances I have ever seen. Her eyes, her voice, her manner, her entire being have a quality of wholeness that is rarely encountered in the theater. James Earl Jones is almost as remarkable as Boesman. South African authorities have refused Mr. Fugard a passport to leave his native land. However, nothing better than Mr. Fugard's writing has come out of South Africa in years. For Walter Kerr, see Page 1.",1970-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"History, or at least the reading of history, can be a consolation. Jon Kimche's review of events in the Middle East from the end of World War I to the present puts the daily reports of bloodletting in that area into perspective. It puts a distance between these daily accounts and the reader. The intensity is lessened. The story on the front page that sounds so full of disaster (and may well be) is scaled down and takes its place in the unhappy history of that region. Eis book makes for grim reading. Yet because the book increases our understanding, its effect is buoyant as if understanding sets the spirit free. It is not another history of the ArabIsraeli conflict, though that contention figures, as it must, in the latter flair or me book. A British journalist and editor of the magazine The New Middle East, he deals rather with the major Arab countries and the European powers with which they were and areenmeshed. The current troubles, he says, can be traced back directly to the political arrangements worked out for the Middle East after World War With the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Britain especially saw herself as taking over the places where the Turk had once been.

Here we have a group of people in a steam bath, we learn their stories, and one by one they pass through the door that leads to heaven, hell, infinity or backstage. Mr. Friedman's concept of God as a man trying to divert himself with party games and the exercise of his power is amusing. But it is a remote joke and one that cannot build within the play. The play has been staged by Anthony Perkins firmly and vigorously. The acting was good from top to bottom. Mr. Perkins is fine as the hero, Tandy, but perhaps a little too Wasplike (if you'll pardon the expression) for the play. Hector Elizondo played God with wit, charm and the right offhand, will ful grace. For Jay No vick's opinion see Page 1.",1970-07-12T05:00:00+0000

It is not only that I don't want to be blown up while stepping out of the ele vator to go read for an enzymedeter gent commercial in the Pan Am building, it's also that I guess I believe in systems, generally, and I know that na matter whose it is, there will always be one. For me, it's largely a matter of how much room in the middle they give the sane ones to do their thing. To me, the theater is a sane thing. Considered in the abstract, it stands on the delicate middle ground between action and reac tion, subtly shadowing both. I remember a photograph in The Family of Man of a dead soldier, lying on his face in a ditch. He is American and the war is Korea, but he could be Viet Cong, Ibo, or Persian.

us,Screen: 'Darling Lili' Sets the Stage for Pure Comedy of Roman Gestures.:'Cowards' Gives War Views at the Carnegie Julie Andrews in Title Role at Music Hall,"""Darling Lili"" is a movie of heroic attitudes and romantic gestures, about a World War I British musical comedy star named Lili (Julie Andrews), who also happens to be a German spy, and the Eagle Squadron ace (Rock Hudson) whom she seduces in the cause of the Kaiser's victory.However, because the film is the work of Blake Edwards (""The Party,"" ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?""), you may be sure that the heroic attitudes have been assumed for all the wrong reasons (if, in fact, they've been assumed for any reasons at all), and that the romantic gestures go disastrously awrywhich is what pure comedy is all about.There is, for example, something sweetly, intelligently insane in the sight of Lili, who spends a good deal of her time passing military secrets to men off of U-boats, leading a terrorized London theater audience through some patriotic choruses of ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" during a German air raid. This one brief moment is wiser, funnier and more sardonic than anything in last year's lugubriously well-meaning ""Oh, What a Lovely War!""""Darling Lili,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is, in many ways, a pure if not perfect comedy. It is big, long, overproduced, but it has a lot of perverse charm and real cinematic beauty, especially in its scenes depicting the graceful, courtly dogfights between the Eagle Squadron ace and the notorious Red Baron.Its sense of humor moves easily from hilarious, potentially lethal slapstick (a plane crashing drunkenly through a tree) to satire of the conventions of movies. I particularly cherish a London newspaper headline that appears towards the end of the movie (and after the war), ""Notorious Spy Sings for War Relief,"" an event that turns out to be a loving welcome home (to London) of the spy the boys had left behind them. Among other things, it's the sentimental, absolute end of the Mata Hari legend.Although Miss Andrews (the film, not stage, star) has always struck me as a very mitigated delight, she may be the perfect centerpiece for this sort of fantasy. That is, her angular, aggressive profile, combined with her coolness and precision as a comedienne and a singer, give the immediate, comic lie to the adventures of a supposedly irresistible femme fatale. She thus is immensely funny with Hudson in an extended bedroom scene in which she makes her lover, who is exhausted, try to carry her to the bed (he can't figure out how to put her down so that she faces in the right direction). If she really were sexy, it wouldn't be funny.Edwards sometimes goes too far in his admiration for the star. The film opens with a totally dark screen, in the center of which Miss Andrews slowly materializes in a stage spotlight, all glistening jewels and looking as awesome as Anapurna at sunrise. Later he gives her a comic striptease, which only goes to prove that when you take the clothes off a Girl Guide, you've got a very naked Girl Guide.She is, however, an often lovely comedienne, whether playing straight man to Hudson, when he cuts short a midnight rendezvous with a stoic reminder that ""I fly at dawn,"" or making the regrettable decision to confess her espionage activities to the French police (a heroic gesture that only puts her lover in worse trouble).She is beautifully supported by Hudson, who is beginning to look a bit tired and overweight, and especially by Lance Percival, as a disconnected, always drunk, British flier who says thinks like ""I'm glad to see you up and around, even if you're sitting down,"" and Andr Maranne and Jacques Marin, as two French investigators from the world of ""A Shot in the Dark.""Edwards has spared no expense in the film, which he shot all over France and Belgium, as well as in Hollywood. At one point, he apparently rented the chateau at Chantilly and hired 1,000 extras just for one quick, ironic scene of Lili being presented the Legion of Honor. The film grows weary from time to time, and the old, fine, schmaltzy World War I songs have been supplemented by some new, not-so-fine, schmaltzy Henry Mancini songs. It still is fun, however.As a historical note, I might also point out that ""Darling Lili"" is in itself the kind of romantic gesture we're not likely to see again for a very long time. It's the last of the mammoth movie musicals (""Dolly,"" ""Paint Your Wagon"") that were inspired by the success of ""The Sound of Music"" (and each of which cost two or three times as much as Alaska).

us,Screen: 'You Can't Win' Em All' Proves a Cliche:Collinson's Caper Film Written by Gordon,"If you pay close attention, near the middle of ""You Cain't Win 'Em All,"" a new Post-World-War-I Turkish caper movie at the Loew's State II and Loew's Orpheum theaters, you will notice with an unpleasant shock, that the reckless troop of cavalry being decimated before your eyes are falling off their horses and gamely biting the dust in exactly the same manner and with exactly the same gestures as were another supposedly quite different reckless troop of cavalry being decimated scarcely a minute before. From this you may learn that an action film director assaying the Valley of Death should make sure that the extras to the right of him are not recognizably also the extras to the left of him. And that, I fear, is all you will learn from this film, which tries every other trick of its dull trade, and fails at all of them.Peter Collinson, whose career until now (for example ""The Penthouse,"" ""The Italian Job"") does not inspire confidence, has directed ""You Can't Win 'Em All"" for clichs not only of the adventure movie and the caper movie and the warfare nostalgia movie (biplane bombers, and armored train, old staff cars, etc.), but also of the exotic picturesque. Lacking a plot of any interest, it settles instead for spectacular scenerywhich it keeps revealing by drawing back or up and away from the file of mercenaries or the speeding train or whateveras if the matter in view were to become less uninteresting the further you get from it  which in the case of ""You Can't Win 'Em All"" is pretty much true.Tony Curtis plays one adventurer and Charles Bronson plays another adventurer and Michele Mercier plays the sex interest (not much) and a cast of hundreds (or maybe dozens; that cavalry charge puts me on my guard) plays the last of the Ottoman Empire, the Young Turks, the Greek army, and, providentially, the United States Marines. But for that sweet sense of male companionship that in one form or another has sustained the best of the genre from Ford through Peckinpah, the film discovers no resources. It is therefore aimless in its energies, lost in its landscapes, and hopelessly wasteful of its ancient conventions.",1970-07-25T05:00:00+0000

Twentyfive people wit nessed some terrifying earlier event, and of these only four still live. To them it becomes apparent that many of the 21 deaths were arranged. The sur vivors, driven together by fear but no mutual trust or affection, inquire, strike tender nerves, provoke and commit violence, react in different ways accord ing to their psychological frameworks (guilt, zest), and plunge toward a fatal inevita bility.

us,Screen: Kadar's 'The Angel Levine':Belafonte Is the Angel of Malamud's Tale Zero Mostel Portrays a Troubled Tailor,"Bernard Malamud's short story, ""Angel Levine,"" about how a black Jewish angel comes to earth to save the health, the wife, and the fortunes of a New York teller, is a charming, if slightly sensational, success in a minor genre. Jan Kadar's new movie. ""The Angel Levine"" (the article added, perhaps, so you shouldn't think it's about a Puerto Rican-Jewish angel), is, given the reputations of the talents involved, a failure of major proportions. I have seen worse movies. But I cannot remember having seen a movie so nervously at odds with itself, so timid in its impulses, and so mistaken in its choices.The Malamud story is very brief, as befits the limited potential of its cheerful anecdote. Like other Malamud fiction of the 1950's, like many of the stories collected with it in ""The Magic Barrel,"" (New York, 1958), it plays with a certain parochial pride in the notion of being Jewish. When the tailor finally recognizes the angel and thus preserves his universe, his pleased reaction is: ""A wonderful thing . . . Believe me, there are Jews everywhere""and you must accept the attitude behind this punch line as somehow completing an ethnocentric world-view in which miracles are second nature.The movie accepts very little though it adds a lotincluding two useless characters and an unhappy ending. Actually, it seems to add three or four endings, repeatedly stopping and starting up again, and the ending on the screen, when the houselights come up, happens to be unhappy.For the Malamud sense of community it substitutes an improbable tenement surrounded by gleaming apartment houses in the high-rise 60's. And for the Malamud world-view (really, a somewhat too mystical cozy cosmology), it substitutes a scattered sociology much influenced by current events.Not only does the film provide naturalistic death for Levine, but also once it has him dead it keeps doubting his immortality and even then saddles him with a sullen, soulful girl friend (the silliest role and, from Gloria Foster, the worst performance in the movie) whom, for reasons that he seems too embarrassed to explain, he can't marry. Levine says he is Jewish but he acts angry black, and for the tailor's ethnic protectionism there are many humiliating words. The effort to produce a now ""Angel Levine"" seems misguided at best, and Kadar's film generally falls with the worst.Nobody in the cast escapes unscathed, but Harry Belafonte, by dint of sheer ordinariness, suffers least. Milo O'Shea, as the friendly Jewish family physician, struggles pointlessly through an international variety of accents, mostly Irish. Between Zero Mostel and Ida Kaminska (the tailor and his wife) it is difficult to say whether the greater misplaced energy has been expended in making his miserable old age seem shabby, or in making hers seem grand. I admire the calculations of neither performance.Mostel's ancient orthodoxy is more Old Testament than old country, and you can pretty well sense each shamble in the characterization clicking into place. But Miss Kaminska plays the noble dying matriarch with an inappropriate elegance that might challenge the histrionic ambitions of a coven of Jewish grandmothers, and it is her performance that chiefly pushes ""The Angel Levine"" into sentimental idiocy.She is amply assisted by Kadar (""The Shop on Main Street,"" also with Ida Kaminska) whose tricky, inexpressive directing offers no discoveries but many well-worn clichs.Kadar's ideas about the fiction are diffuse and simplistically humanistic (as Malamud's really are not), and he seems afraid of each necessary hint of a super-nature. To make up the deficiency there is a dreadful musical background, a kind of middle-European choir of heavenly voices that sings loudly and insistently and almost all the timeas if the spirit that moved upon the face of the waters were standing off the set, waiting for the services to begin.",1970-07-29T05:00:00+0000

us,John Wayne Rides Again in 'Chisum',"As ""Chisum"" opens, there sits John Wayne on his horse, both of them frozen in profile by a lonesome pine. ""Chisum, Chisum,"" thunder a chorus and orchestra, ""he'll still keep goin' on."" And you'd better believe it, especially with the same business repeated at the fadeout. In between, there are few surprises.In this typical range-war exercise for Big John he plays his tough, laconic self of yore, a settled-down rancher who watches a New Mexico community slide under the heel of the villainous Forrest Tucker. It takes a lot to rouse Wayne, but the climax is a deafening tribute to justice triumphant, with a town leveled by a cattle stampede through a blazing gun were in the streets. You'll never be able to tote up the corpses.Essentially, this is a conventional Western, not the kind that such directors as John Ford and Henry Hathaway have pulled up taut with sharp character components. As such, it has a couple of things in its favor, such as the excellent, panoramic color photography by William H. Clothier. A large, sprawling cast, trotting at the heels of Wayne, performs vigorously. And under the direction of Andrew V. McLaglen, it looks as Western as all get-out. It may ramble but it does move.Tucker, for instance, comes across with snap and bite. Patric Knowles conveys the same, as an altruistic Englishman on the prairie. Young Geoffrey Deuel cuts a personable swath as Billy the kid, and several other hardies such as Ben Johnson, Glenn Corbett and Richard Jaeckel pitch in accordingly, with Pamela McMyler and Lynda Day as fetching ornaments.Forget substance.

It is a touching fact, they write, that the King realized earlier than those around him that he was losing control over his body and mind.
