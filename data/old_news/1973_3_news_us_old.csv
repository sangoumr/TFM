But the date could have been Jan. 30, 1972, and the number of dead 13, because in its external trappings, Mr. Friel's play is a bitterly ironic documentary on Bloody Sunday, on disastrous overreaction by security forces, on the subsequent Widgery tribunal of inquiry and on the response to the killings by churchmen, politicians and people.",1973-03-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Movies: 'Thief Who Came to Dinner':Movies: 'Thief Who Came to Dinner' Jacqueline Bisset and Ryan O'Neal Star The Cast,"Bud Yorkin's ""The Thief Who Came to Dinner"" is about a based young computer analyst named Webster (Ryan O'Neal) who chucks the straight life to become the best adjusted, most successful jewel thief in Houston, nicknamed the chess burglar because of his fondness for leaving chess pieces at the scenes of his crimes.In the course of his upward movement Webster falls perfectly in love with an amused society girl (Jacqueline Bisset), befriends the sober-sided insurance investigator (Warren Oates) who tries to trap him and causes the nervous breakdown of The Houston Chronicle's chess editor (Austin Pendleton). Webster suffers a superficial gunshot wound at one point.It would be difficult to name any contemporary film with less sense of consequence than ""The Thief Who Came to Dinner,"" yet it's this quality that gives the comedy its buoyancy even when its sense of humor fails. It's the quality of a lot of old Hollywood comedies that one is inclined to remember as being funnier than they were simply because they were cheerfully mindless of awful possibilities.It's also the quality that Peter Bogdanovich almost exhausted himself to achieve in ""What's Up, Doc,"" and while ""The Thief Who Came to Dinner"" is not so funny, Yorkin, the director (""Start The Revolution Without Me""), and his screenwriter, Walter Hill, haven't tried so hard.The film, however, has been carefully castthe principal roles as well as the supporting characters. By being almost too beautiful to be either true or good, O'Neal and Miss Bisset further remove the comedy from the sort of reality in which jewel thieves are probably hopeless neurotics. Both Oates and Pendleton are maniacally serious about themselves and therefore extremely funny, as are Ned Beatty, as a Houston jewel fence, and Jill Clayburgh, as O'Neal's first wife, who, remembering how bored she was with O'Neal as a computer analyst, wants to return to the man who has become a jewel thief. ""I was short-changed,"" she says curtly.""The Thief Who Came to Dinner,"" which opened yesterday at Loew's State 2 and the Beekman, is no avalanche of hilarity, but it respects a kind of comic make-believe that is rare in movies these days. You can like it without laughing a lot.",1973-03-02T05:00:00+0000

In variety of test cases he contended that judges could not simply dispose of mentally ill defendants by declaring them incompetent to stand trial and incarcerating them in hospitals for the criminally insane; that the state could not hospitalize a person if less drastic forms of treatment were feasible; that mental patients who had been committed on the grounds that they needed treatment must be offered meaningful treatment or discharged. He also contended that hospitals could not force medication on unwilling patients or exploit them in menial jobs rationalized as therapy; that employers and educational institutions could not automatically reject applications from former inmates.

In the nineteensixties, eclectic meant a traditional room with an occasional glassandsteel accent. Today it's just the opposite. Modern furnishings, natural woods and textures dominate; period objects have become the accents. Designer Bob Patino heartily approves the whole (undoubtedly fleeting) new status quo, which is reflected in his small apartment. His former color scheme spiced with bright red and yellow has been replaced by a cool offwhite with accent colors of palest pastels in subtle textures. There's a thirties echo in the living room's pyramidbased ottomans, in the mirrored foyer archway, and the plump rounded bed that doubles as a sofa in the bedroomstudy. Accent pieces are authentic to the period, such as the chromelegged console and Art Deco mirror off the foyer.

us,"Slither, 'Film of Illogical Events.:The Cast:","One week after he has been let out of prison after serving two years for car theft, Dick Kanipsia (James Caan) is ready to go back in. Clearly prison is sanity's sanctuary. The straight world has been occupied by lunatics.First off, there is the assassination attempt when persons unknown storm the farmhouse where Dick is visiting a former prison mate. Dick, an aging athlete, has the sweet, uncomplaining resilience of the none-too-bright but things like that worry him. So, too, does the kindly truck driver who gives him a ride and then, for no apparent reason, threatens to break his arm.The most ba???fling creature??? however, is Kitty Kopetsky (Sally Kellerman), who offers to give him a lift to the beach and proceeds, among other things, to hold up a lunch counter. Kitty, a pill-popper, confides: ""There's this battle going on inside me. The forces of evil against the forces of light."" She pauses, then adds with a beatific smile: ""I'll swing with the winner.""All of this is just the beginning of ""Slither,"" a comedy-melodrama about America going to the madhouse in mobile homes, or specifically, about a cross-country trailer chase by Dick, Kitty, and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Fenaka (Peter Boyle and Louise Lasser) to locate what someone describes as ""wealth beyond your wildest dreams."" Actually it's $312,000 (which is not quite beyond my wild-were embezzled seven years earlier by Barry Fenaka and Dick's now-dead prison friend.For almost three-quarters of the way (which is about one-quarter of the way furest dreams) in funds that the???r than most films of this sort), ""Slither"" is as funny and bizarre as it means to be. A sort of wet-blanket of reason eventually is thrown over the narrative when W. D. Richter, who wrote the original screenplay, feels compelled to supply explanations for a lot of the perfectly illogical events we've accepted earlier. Until then, ""Slither"" is a most entertaining, thoroughly anarchic morality play about an innocent who wakes up to find that his land has been taken over by greedy but mostly ineffectual body-snatchers.Because few American comedies are ever bothered by such visions, I may have enjoyed???""Slither"" somewhat more than is warranted by the bright but inconsistent material. The movie is the first directorial effort of Howard Zieff, who is credited as the man who thought up those comic Benson ??? Hedges TV commercials, which, one might think, would be no guarantee that he could make a feature film as good as this one. As short as they are, however, commercials do depend on a sense of timing and casting, both of which are obvious here.Miss Kellerman, Mr. Boyle and Miss Lasser do the sort of thing they've done before, though better, but Mr. Caan (""The Godfather""), one of our best young leading actors, is a real surprise as the Candide-like ex-con.

us,"Harris Stars in and Directs 'The Hero,' Twilight of an Athlete:The Cast","Forty years old, fading star of the Tel Aviv soccer team, not much to show for a life of hard play except slowed reflexes, rich in feelings, of courseand frustrationsbut with nothing you could call a brain, he marshals his meager resources to face his greatest crisis: his Last Big Game. He is pursued by his past and haunted by his future. His fans are fickle, his apartment's a mess and his car won't go.He is Eitan, played by Richard Harris and the subject of Mr. Harris's ""The Hero,"" and I've only begun to list his problems. Perhaps the biggest is Nira (Romy Schneider), beautiful sculptor with a burgeoning career and a fine new car. Eitan loves Fira, and after six years of courtship still doesn't know what to do about it. But his worst problem may be the littlest: Nimrod (kim Burfield), a kid from a kibbutz who lives for soccer and idolizes Eitan. He is a constant reproach. While Eitan drowns his sorrows in vodka Nimrod refuses ice cream conesso as not to break training.Anyone familiar with the tradition of the Last Big Game can supply the rest: the careless friends, the callous owners, the fears of age against the demands of youth. It all comes too easily, a kind of prepackaged drama with the fatal distinction that not only is the story formula, but the emotional response must be formula as well.As a director, and as an actor, Mr. Harris isn't about to deny himself indulgences. His performance is full of too many emphases, appeals to sympathy, expressions of imprecise rage. But his movie is equally mannered. And it is simply the nature of the medium that it can survive an excessive performance better than a gratuitous camera angle or a passage of lyrical slow-motion intended to force a feeling.When Eitan faces his team's managers (he is being offered a contract that will effectively put him out to pasture) he sits on a low stool in the center of an almost bare roomlike Joan of Arc before the ecclesiastical court at Rouen. A crooked gambler who bribes him to throw the game (you thought you'd escaped that?) materializes out of the shadows, and tempts Eitan with a convertible that almost glows in the dark. But the game itself is thrown away in a confused mess of fancy editing, and whatever might have shown the meaning in an athlete's life is lost in an attempt to make cinematic points.Through this movie, as through so much of her mature career, Romy Schneider moves like a bemused enigma, beautiful, mysterious and unexciting. The boy, Kim Burfield, is an accomplished actorbut he is directed very broadly, for a style to match Mr. Harris's. But there are no career predictions to be made from ""The Hero."" Though it opened here only yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, it is not a new film, and it played at European festivals three years ago under the name ""Bloomfield.""",1973-03-09T05:00:00+0000

It was by a young writer named Thomas Pynchon, of whom we knew virtually nothing, and it was, to say the least, oat of the more remarkable first novels to be published in this country in several decades. Four years later came a sort of postscriptural squiggle, a short but mysteriously beautiful novella called The Crying of Lot 49 (whose title could also be read in a number of different ways), but we still knew very little about Pynchon except that he could write. Then a long silenceno surfacing, no interviews, no rumors, no word. And now, seven years later, like the screaming ... across the sky with which it begins (It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.), comes Pynchon's third novel, Gravity's Rainbow (the number of ways you can read this title are practically infinite). And though we still have learned nothing of Pynchon's extraliterary life, we now know he is one of our literary treasures.

us,"Screen: 'Ludwig,' a Study in Depravity, Arrives","Ludwig II became king of Bavaria in 1864, at the age of 19, and more or less misruled until he was certified insane, three days before his suicide in 1886. He was not a good man. Like A. A. Milne's King John, Ludwig had his whims and ways, only a few of which have put posterity in his debt: he was Richard Wagner's friend and patron through thick and thin, and he was responsible for the construction of some of Bavaria's maddest castles, including the spectacular Neuschwanstein. Yesterday's fiscal scandal is today's tourist attraction, but Ludwig was mostly a rotter.It's this aspect of Ludwig that seems most to fascinate Luchino Visconti, the great Italian director whose preoccupation with things Germanic is resulting in films of progressively less importance.""The Damned"" (1969), as operatic as it was, was a hugely effective evocation of a civilization's collapse as detailed in the terrible deeds of a Krupp-like munitions family. Visconti's adaptation of Mann's ""Death in Venice"" (1971) failed, but it failed with such consistent intelligence that one was always aware of a system of ideas within it.""Ludwig,"" which opened yesterday at the 59th Street Twin 2 Theater, is opera buffa that doesn't know it. Visconti and his writers give us the story of Ludwig's reign (or, at least, the outline of it) in a manner that is meant to be grand but actually is just a frantic inventory of what historians usually call his excesseshis rather superficial appreciation for art and architecture, his love of sweets (which resulted in his teeth falling out) and especially his love affairs with a series of grooms, actors and other pretty fellows.Visconti has been such an intelligent film maker in the past that it's difficult to believe that ""Ludwig"" could be quite as bereft of ideas as it is. Is it about kingship? About the genesis of the Second Reich under the domination of the Prussian dynasty? About family? I don't think so. All of these things are touched upon at one point or another, in the almost three hours of running time, but always in what would be called telephone scenes in a contemporary dramathe sort of get-it-over-with scenes designed to give us necessary information as quickly as possible.Mostly ""Ludwig"" consists of the spectacle of Ludwig (Helmut Berger) getting more and more depraved, from the early scenes in which he delays his coronation to drink champagne from a goblet (in movies about depravity, people always drink from goblets, not glasses) to those in which he spies on one of his grooms bathing nude in the castle lake, until, toward the end, there's a full-scale, though fairly lethargic orgy. We've seen most of these things done better in other Visconti films.It may be one of my biases, but movies about royal personages, usually trike me as being essentially comic. It has something to do with a lot of ordinary folk trying to act like royals, and usually succeeding in looking only like stage extras. The royals in ""Ludwig"" all seem a little second-rate, even Romy Schneider, who plays Ludwig's cousin, the Empress Elizabeth of Austria, with whom he thinks he is sort of in love. It also has something to do with the rhythm of drama in which so much emphasis is placed on the arrivals and departures of royal carriages, on entrances up grand staircases and on people walking regally through doorways.These things give ""Ludwig"" an air of self-importance that it doesn't deserve, any more than it deserves the almost nonstop Wagner and Schumann on the soundtrack. The images can't compete.There is one interesting performance in the entire film. Trevor Howard makes a rather British Wagner, but he is a profoundly interesting combination of self-absorption, craftiness, genius and vision. Because everyone else acts as if trying to make an impression during the eruption of a volcano, the comparative understatement of Howard's performance rivets the attention.",1973-03-09T05:00:00+0000

A nice analysis then ensued to show how the evening would be a success only if Mailer made a fool of himself, for that was what people had paid to see. It was Mailer's pride, Leonard assumed, to manipulate that relationship, and he was right. He had put his finger on the precise pride. There had been the little hypothesis that when people wholly unaccustomed to paying their way into any party's were required to pay their way into mine, a concentration of attention would be then produced upon the founding of a Fifth Estate which could not be equaled in a year of quiet serious responsible conversations with responsible and serious people, particularly since one's hardearned Jamesian sense of stroke suggested that the most useful party ingredient in a city so evil as New York is curiosity. So it was declared by the invitation that one would make an announcement of national importance (major)this last parenthesis naturally opposed to anything of national importance which might be minor, a useful distinction. New York, I knew, would not come to the birthday but to the secret. And that was wellkept. (The woman nearest to one's life asked naturally for the secret. I'll tell you, but if the night doesn't turn out, you're bound to catch the blame. Tell me no secret.)",1973-03-11T05:00:00+0000

He is a shill for the novelist; he holds up the applause sign, endorses cosmic significance. Even the harsh landscape barns it up: windmills, tornados, whatever, have an emblematic outline. The visual arts can chance this; muteness may be accepted as objectivity, selfeffacement before the event. A novel has other, more garrulous, business: to assert, to think, to take judgmental risks.

I should have known better. There have been White Sisters on film beforetwo, in fact: Lillian Gish in 1923 and Helen Hayes in 1933and though their stories haven't much to do with Sophia Loren in the nineteen-seventies, they, like she, were nursing nuns.Expelled from her African home and duty by the revolutionary government of Libya, Sister Germana (Miss Loren) is assigned to a hospital in Italywhere, immediately, she takes charge. It is a happy-go-lucky hospital, unusual, and with two doctors, two lay nurses, two orderlies, a cook, several hundred patients, and Sophia Loren.Miss Loren controls the wards, keeps the records, tastes the food, supervises the nurses and assists in the operating room. She is without peer and without competitionexcept from one patient, Annibale Pezzi (Adriano Celentano), atheist, communist and amorous young malingerer who wants to run the hospital his way. It is immediately obvious that he and she will fall in love.Each in his own way, Annibale and Sister Germana, are forces for good. And from the combination of two such forcesat least in a movie like ""White Sister""  there can come only supergood.Beyond a spell of pouting for Annibale and a bit of heartbreak for Sister Germana, there is not much relief from the goodness, though a hospital always provides emergency cases, terminal cases, hair-breadth recoveries and malpractice mortalitiesthe whole day-to-day life-and-death routine of the place to make up for real dramatic action.Annibale and Sister Germana have a momentary spiritual union maybe, but no affair. Once they hold hands and, under extenuating circumstances, they kiss (she is devout, but no prude). But the general aura of sentimental piety is never dispelled, not even by the presence of Sophia Loren.For those who feel, as I do, that if there were no cinema Sophia Loren would be sufficient reason for inventing it, ""White Sister"" will offer very little more than a beautiful but unanimated mask of their heroine.Adriano Celentano, a good actor (scarcely known here), is made to portray a kind of sullen rough-edge cuteness. And Fernando Rey, as the hospital's chief of staff, plays straight the quality of distinguished gentleness that he has so brilliantly parodied in the films of Luis Bunuel.Alberto Lattuada directs down for drama and up for emotion with a sometimes-appealing innocence. When a young man expires in a hospital bed to the accompaniment of violins and cellos, and a heavenly choir (I swear) just at the moment of his passing overit seems less like film than like archaeology, like unearthing the world's oldest clich, long dead but with its heart still gamely beating.""White Sister"" opened Saturday at the Columbia I Theater.",1973-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Ross Hunter's Version of 'Lost Horizon' Opens:The Cast,"To a small boy in 1937, Frank Capra's film adaptation of James Hilton's ""Lost Horizon"" did not seem as naive as it did the last time I saw it, four or five years ago, but it remains an example of romantic Hollywood filmmaking at its best. It has the style of Ronald Colman, the wit of Robert Riskin (its screenwriter) and its sets, costumes and special effects are superb. In those days, there was virtually no place or thing that could not be reproduced bigger than life on any Hollywood backlot.One can even accept the Capra film's rather smug, ostrichlike attitudes toward world problems, if only as a souvenir of the decade that gave us, among other things, the Reichstag fire, Munich and World War II. Shangri-La  Hilton's secret Tibetan valley where poverty, illness and age are unknown and the only excesses are those of moderation  is an almost perfect expression of the wishes of a very specific time  one that is long-since past, at least to me.Not so to Ross Hunter, the producer (""Airport,"" ""Imitation of Life,"" ""Magnificent Obsession"") who has devoted a lot of his career to trying to preserve the glamour that once was Hollywood's by ransacking its old movies. With his updated, musicalized remake of ""Lost Horizon,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State I and the Tower East Theaters, Hunter persists in his mad if harmless mission with the fanaticism of someone trying to build sandcastles at the water's edge.This ""Lost Horizon,"" with Peter Finch at the head of a not-quite-all-star cast, is a big, stale marshmallow, notable, perhaps, in that most of it was filmed in and around Hollywood at what is reported to have been a rather large budget. Money apparently doesn't go very far in Hollywood these days, for the film, in addition to packing all of the dramatic punch of a Moral Re-Armament pamphlet, is surprisingly tacky in appearance.When we aren't seeing the magical valley of Shangri-La in long-shot as something painted through trick photography, we see it in close-up as a couple of seedy backlot sets, one of which, the High Lama's palace, looks like Pickfair remodelled as a motel. The old Hollywood craftsmanship is as dead as the arch attitudes and philosophizing of Larry Kramer's screenplay, which replays most of the memorable moments of the original film, with sometimes hilarious results.""I am Chang,"" says John Gielgud, his eyes slightly taped for an Oriental effect, but you are not meant to snicker. ""Can this be the skin of a 100-year-old woman?"" asks 20-year-old Olivia Hussey who plays the remarkably well-preserved Maria, whom we all wait to turn into an ancient peanut once she goes beyond the Shangri-La pass.The most hilarious moments, however, are the original contributions of Hunter, Charles Jarrott, his director, and Hermes Pan, who choreographed some of the great Astaire-Rogers musicals but is out of his element here.With the exception of Bobby Van, who plays a second-rate comic who is hijacked to Shangri-La along with Finch, the British diplomat, nobody in the film can dance very well, not the chorus boys (featured in a pricelessly ill-suited number celebrating the joys of fatherhood) nor poor Sally Kellerman, who plays a Newsweek correspondent fed up with life. It's extraordinary how Miss Kellerman successfully maintains her appeal even while failing as a singer and dancer. Dancer? What she does is try to keep time.The second-rate auspices just about destroys everyone in the film, with the possible exceptions of Finch, Van and Michael York. Liv Ullmann, who is the world's most beautiful woman when photographed by Ingmar Bergman, is stiff and uncomfortable as a Shangri-La school mistress. Charles Boyer, as the High Lama, dressed in a sheet, looks like the ghost of Hamlet's father emerging from a steam-bath. And how long has it been since you've seen the soul of a dying man depart through a window? You'll see it again here.The music written by Burt Bacharach is often pleasant, but it's too sophisticated for both the movie and the lyrics, written by Hal David. The lyrics, when not silly, have a way of attracting attention to the ersatz nature of the entire enterprise. ""Look inside yourself,"" Miss Ullmann sings to Finch, ""that's where the truth always lies."" The conjunction of truth and lies hardly seems accidental in a film that sets out to recall a kind of filmmaking now lost, but succeeds only in denting pleasant memories.",1973-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Vivid 'Soleil-O':Mel Hondo Makes Dramatic Outcry in Film Debut About Blacks in France,"""Soleil-O,"" which opened yesterday at the Olympia Theater, is sharply direct about some of the darkness that has enveloped immigrant, African blacks in France, particularly in Paris.In his first film, the young, black Mauritanian stage actor-director Mel Hondo makes a pitiable and often dramatic outcry even if his dramatization of injustices is open-ended and inconclusive.Mr. Hondo is presenting the sad, frustrating existences of his black brother workers in an alien country through the experiences of one educated, gentle immigrant from Mauritania.While his obvious anger seems biased on occasion, he is meticulous in stressing that white employers and other citizens are fearful of the ever-increasing numbers of black people in France, who were ""only a handful"" in 1946 and are in the hundreds of thousands now.If he is elliptical in his use of symbolism and a stream-of-consciousness approach, his total portrait, like the film, is stark black-and-white. A white entrepreneur blandly outlines the need for work aptitude tests to the tall, bearded, young hero at the beginning of his quest for a better life in Paris.But the civil, religious and educational principles inculcated in African blacks by French colonialists are, however, of little help in qualifying them for jobs in present-day Paris.The anomaly of people adrift is projected through the cold attitude of wary employers (and union leaders), menial jobs, lack of housing and varied forms of racism. Mr. Hondo, it must be underlined, also is unsparing in his view of black officials in their own country who, it says here, are merely giving the expatriates little but official doubletalk.One assumes that behind all the symbols, Mr. Hondo is looking for salvation that might come from the precepts of Malcolm X and other black revolutionaries whose portraits we glimpse toward the end of his film.Mr. Hondo and Robert Liensol, who plays the leading role forcefully and naturally, and the others in his cast of blacks and whites (simply listed by their proper names), have not solved the problem or come up with a prospective solution to it.But they and, particularly, Mr. Hondo, whose imagery tends to be arty and disjointed, have given us a drama that remains disturbingly vivid.",1973-03-15T05:00:00+0000

That is the scale, the only proper scale, to apply to Michael Tuchner's ""Fear Is the Key,"" a minor, rather satisfying entertainment that opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.It is based on an Alistair MacLean novel, and like ""Puppet on a Chain,"" the last Alistair MacLean novel seen on film here, it has a little of the look and something of the feel of a James Bond thrillerbut cheaper, more threadbare, with fewer gadgets and more nerve.This doesn't necessarily make for better movies, but it should make for different expectations. People seem to wear the same clothes all through the film. They chase economy cars, shoot from smaller arsenals. And sometimes second best, like virtue, is its own reward.So the film seems to need its locationsthe flat Louisiana coastline, the offshore oilfields, the sumptuous rain-swept mansion (this last shot in England)for use rather than just for exotic appeal. There is a car chase, ingenious, obligatory, overlong and rather dull, but there are also the tidal swamps, the mostly empty roads receding into a distance that make up in atmospheric emotion for what the story lacks in sense.The story, an incredible intrigue enacted by one John Talbot (Barry Newman) to revenge the murder of his wife and child and at the same time make the world safe for Western monetary systems, is sufficient for the movie but not for critical examination. It is enough that it provides some dangerous encounters and the particular kind of good-guy heroics that have become trade.Barry Newman's stock in No matter where he is courting danger (""The Salzburg Connection,"" ""Vanishing Point"") Newman always seems vaguely out of place. I've about decided that ""out of place"" is really where he belongs, and that he is not so much the hero as a fantasist (city-bred, nice Jewish boy, good-looking though a trifle cross-eyed) seeking heroism.When he goes ""Aaargh,"" near suffocation underwater in the film's climax, he is almost pure comic book  which is already a kind of sophistication, though perhaps not so intended. It is in terms of such comic-book sophistication that he meets the villain, Vyland (John Vernon), and will one day court the heroine, Sarah Ruthven (Suzy Kendall), waiting for him topsides with her oil-rich dad.We never really put away childish things, and when we pick them up from time to time it may be well that we can do it with games as gracefully innocuous as ""Fear Is the Key.""",1973-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Vault of Horror' Opens:The Cast,"If there is, as I believe, a natural hierarchy in horror films  then to the top rises the vampire movie, and at the very bottom creeps the scary omnibus vignette film, especially the scary vignette film with comic undertones. An example of the last, ""The Vault of Horror,"" opened yesterday at three local theaters.Actually, ""The Vault of Horror"" contains a brief vampire story, called ""Midnight Mess"" (that title happens to be the cleverest thing in the movie), that makes the mistake of equating vampirism with sustenance rather than sex. The hero of ""Midnight Mess"" (Daniel Massey), a thorough rotter who becomes dinner before his tale is done, meets each night with four other gentlemen to recount the dream, so he thinks, of his own violent demise.The others do likewise with miseries ranging from burial alive to a fatal rage for order. Everyone pretty much deserves his death (I'm not sure about Terry-Thomas who merely wants his house kept neat), and everyone gets it through one of those ironic twists of fate so dear to the soul of 10th-rate mystery fiction.Several distinguished performers  Anna Massey, Michael Craig, Dawn Addams, Glynis Johns, among others  appear in the film, and none is ever quite so bad as the material warrants.Except for the tacky optical effects in an episode called ""This Trick'll Kill You,"" where you can see the invisible wires supporting an unsupported vertical Indian rope, the film displays a surface proficiency that keeps suggesting better things. The director, Roy Ward Baker (""A Night to Remember,"" ""Five Million Years to Earth""), has made good movies in the past. But toward ""The Vault of Horror"" he displays a reticence approaching fastidiousness, which may be the cover for a well-concealed but very honorable distaste.",1973-03-17T05:00:00+0000

The most dramatic development has been the rapid transformation of Japan's ruined, partly handicraft postwar economy into a giant, hightechnical economy. Even today, moreover, with the example of Japan dramatically there to alert us, few have noticed how often impressive results seem to ensue whenever any unit of Asian society ultimately rooted in the ancient Chinese culture begins to do business in a fully modern way. Yet that lesson is abundantly plain from the examples of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and formerly impoverished South Korea, and it should also become plain in South Vietnam, if the South Vietnamese ever get the chance to do business in comparative peace.",1973-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Saladino interpreted the Williamsons' wishes by redesigning the space into a landscape for living. It has curves (a conversation platform, a bar enclosed in a well) that add another dimension to the standard apartment rectangles; sweeps of mirror and stainless steel that extend the magnificent view, and a color scheme of plum, berry red, taupe and sepia that provides an earthy warmth and an emotional lift. There was no need for the objects and art that usually form a counterpoint to the neoBauhaus clich of all white space, the designer points out.

There is, nonetheless, a continual tugofwar going on between singers and composers, and it has become clear in recent years that singers are once again, as at many moments in music's past, winning the tug. It may be that the comparative scarcity of composers who enjoy writing for the voice and who understand how to do it has helped resuscitate the bel canto era's showiest music and thus restored singers to the godlike prominence they enjoyed in older times.

I did support George McGovern, morally, oratorically and even financially, to the bitter end. Not even George knows whether that helped or hurt. My wife had $1,800 in hand or in prospect when we were married. In those days, before Mr. Nixon's economists who view me with such doubt took charge of the dollar, $1,800 was something. But it was hardly a fortune. Since then our asset position has improved, but for an economist that should be elementary. I settled upon Gstaad as a place to write some 18 years ago, well before it became fashionable. Maybe that is why it became fashionable, but this seems unlikely. I'd like to think I didn't come all that recently to a decent break for women. Gloria Steinem might even confirm that I encouraged her.

Some people don't ever have eight hours.""And so together they begin to waste those eight hours hand and hand, strolling down the dark and deserted boulevards past all the tourist attractions of Paris. Pausing before Notre Dame she grows bitterly philosophical: ""By the time you get out, that may have become a parking edifice!"" But eventually they do get to bed, and, through a night of blurred-focus passion, they make love. And if she does not say ""I never knew it could be like this,"" it is perhaps only because she could never be heard over the welling up of the music  the music that follows them everywhere on plucked and bowed strings and sounds nothing like so much as total submission to the last three bars of the ""Summer of '42"" theme.They have come to Parishe, she and the background musicfrom Marrakesh, and they are bound for New York. They are the central elements in Robert Wise's ""Two People,"" a very silly movie that opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater. He is Evan Bonner, high-principled Vietnam war deserter returning home to face the music (not this music, some other music). She is Deirdre McCluskey, high-fashion model and daughter of a West Virginia coal miner (what else?), returning home to her little illegitimate son, to at least $100,000 a year and to a life that has lost its meaning. Naturally, they fall in love.I am tempted to hang the movie with quotations from its dialogue  which would be unfair. It is really equally bad in all departments. It may even be most aggressively awful when its people stop talking and take the train from Marrakesh to Casablance or the plane from Casablanca to Paris (first class all the way) or just watch the streets from their hotel rooms. There has never been such appreciation for the poetry of Paris traffic patterns, and in general the esthetic program behind ""Two People"" seems to be: When in doubt, travel.Estelle Parsons plays a supporting role as a fashion editor accompanying Deirdre, and, though conventionally brittle, her performance comes closer to suggesting two sides to a person than does any other characterization, in the movie. As Deirdre, Lindsay Wagner, a newcomer, is pretty and solemn. But a tendency for her facial expressions to disintegrate into grimaces (perhaps occasioned by the lines she must speak) makes it difficult to accept her quality. Peter Fonda, as Evan Bonner, seems greatly withdrawn to some inward meditationa strategy, I believe, not of performance but of self-defense.Separate units are credited with filming in North Africa, in Paris and in New York City. But ""Two People"" is remarkably of a piecenot with the consistency of a movie director like Robert Wise, but rather with the consistency of something cooked up from the same package of synthetic soup.",1973-03-19T05:00:00+0000

us,' Painters Painting' Explores the Art Scene Here,"In the past, Emile de Antonio has made some fine documentaries, including ""Point of Order"" and ""Millhouse,"" each a scathing, highly biased attack against someone or something. His newest film, ""Painters Painting,"" represents a change of mood. It's a great big, cheerfully uncritical hug of a movie about a subject he adores, the contemporary New York art scene and the people who make it hustle.Watching it is like being at a cocktail party. Robert Rauschenberg is there. Andy Warhol is there (with Brigit Berlin taking Polaroid snaps of him). Jasper Johns is there. As are Barnett Newman and Henry Geldzahler and Kenneth Noland and Frank Stella and Larry Poons. Robert Scull and Ethel are there, looking pleased and modest and just slightly uncomfortable, as if waiting for the next attack by the Philistines who refer to him as the taxi tycoon when he is really the Lorenzo di Medici of pop.The movie is mistitled. It should be called ""Painters Talking."" Although we do see Larry Poons ripping a large color-filled canvas off his studio floor, and although we see old still pictures of the late Jackson Pollock at work, most of the movie is devoted to the painters talking about themselves and their work.A few make sense: Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Andy Warhol (at least, he smiles a lot and looks genuinely modest). At one place or another, some basic points are made about the various trends in American art that followed abstract expressionism. Much of it, however, is cocktail party conversation. Says Barnett Newman: ""Esthetics are for me what ornithology is for birds."",Mr. Rauschenberg says that to be an abstract expressionist one had to have time to feel sorry for oneself. He doesn't and didn't. Mr. Stella says that the kind of contemporary painting he represents is designed, among other things, to keep the viewer from ""reading"" the painting, and to make it difficult for critics to describe and thus difficult to carry out their function.A lot of ""Painters Painting"" is funny (intentionally), some of it is boring (unintentionally) and a great deal of it is somewhat less informative than is absolutely necessary. Hilton Kramer, art editor of The New York Times, is given rather short shrift when he tries to trace the European roots of American abstract expressionism. In the festive context of the rest of the film, his attempt amounts to a social mistake.I would assume that Mr. de Antonio has some opinions (not entirely favorable) about the parts played in the New York scene by various art dealers and curators. You wouldn't know it from ""Painters Painting."" It all looks like a warm, lovable rat race, even though one in which the stakes can be tremendous. Leo Castelli, the dealer, smiles benignly as he tells of the Jasper Johns that was bought for $2,000 and could be sold today for $200,000.Mr. de Antonio has been an observer of the scene for years, and is obviously as fond of the artists as he is fascinated by their work, which has been beautifully photographed in color and black and white by Ed Emshwiller, who is a first-class film maker in his own right.""Painters Painting,"" which opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, looks great. Like so much contemporary painting, however, it involves too much talk.",1973-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: '5 Fingers of Death':The Cast,"A kind of film new to most local audiences, a karate movie called ""Five Fingers of Death,"" written by Chiang Yang, directed by Cheng Chang Ho, and produced in Hong Kong by Run Run Shaw, opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.The hero, Chao Chi-hao (Lo Lieh), a promising student of the martial arts, enrolls in the school of Sun Hsin-pei (Fang Mien), where he is first put to menial tasks like scrubbing floors and chopping firewood  with the sides of his bare hands, of course. But soon he proves his worth, and Sun entrusts him with the secrets of the Iron Fist, a technique that should win him the All-China Karate Tournament.He does win, despite the vile trickery of a rival karate master, and the film's end sees him firm in the love of his hometown sweetheart, Sung Ying Ying (Wang Ping), and dispatching his enemies bodily into several inches of solid brick wallby means of the Iron Fist method, which he has learned to use for all it's worth.To those who will complain that I've given away the ending, let me point out that I've thoughtfully omitted the middle and that there is more than enough plot in ""Five Fingers of Death"" for everyone to share. But plot isn't what the movie is all about. It is all about fighting  kendo and judo, but mainly karate and in several styles. It is bloody and rather flashily spectacular  normally pitting one good guy against 20 bad guys, all armed to the teeth with knives, and with predictably happy results.I don't know much about karate, but I know what I don't like. And the karate in ""Five Fingers of Death,"" for all its slow-motion high leaps, its grunts, its whooshing fists, has the look of the bottom of the barrel. It is all too ??? too ???tously wildas if composed for show rather than for attack, defense or any real purpose.It is entirely possible, perhaps intentionally possible, to take the film as a joke. It has been dubbed into inappropriate English, and it is funny enough, say, when a character named Wan Hung-chieh accosts the beauteous Yen Chu-hung after her recital of traditional Chinese music with ""Hi there? I love the way you sing."" But humor at this level palls very rapidly; laughing at a movie is never fun for long.The net effect of ""Five Fingers of Death"" is to make me appreciate all the more the stylishness, the solemnity, even the gore, of all those doom-ridden Japanese samurai dramas that used to open so regularly a year or so ago at the Bijou.",1973-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,The Gospel According to 'Godspell' Comes to Screen:The Cast,"In filling in some of the narrative gaps in the Gospel according to St. Mark, St. Matthew took pains with the chronology, which, if you read him closely, makes it seem as if Jesus, on the day after He delivered the Sermon on the Mount and effected three healings, was in such good form that He made two lake crossings, healed five more people and held several lengthy discussions.It is this quality of nonstop busyness that is one of the chief assets of ""Godspell,"" both of the Off Broadway musical (still running at the Promenade Theater on upper Broadway) and of the film adaptation that opened yesterday at the Columbia 2 Theater. Especially of the film.This update ofand variation onthe Gospel according to St. Matthew is less a celebration of the life and teachings of Christ than it is a celebration of theater, music, youthful high spirits, New York City locations and the zoom lens. The movie amounts to one long, breathless production number (some of whose parts are considerably less effective than others), as well as a demonstrations that, in films, what is said is often less important than how it's said.""Godspell"" pretty much reduces the story of Jesus to conform to a kind of flower-child paranoia that was probably more popular three or four years ago than it is today: the only way to survive in this world is to drop out of it, which, if you think about it, effectively reverses Jesus' instructions to the disciples.That, however, is to mistake what I, at least, understand ""Godspell"" to be all about. It's not about religion or philosophy but show business, and its framethe life and death of Jesus re-enacted in contemporary Manhattan and environs  is hardly more than a gimmick to allow the show's authors to help themselves to some lovely original material never protected by copyright.At its worst, ""Godspell"" exalts a kind of simplicity and sweetness that are often the disguises of fierce anti-intellectualism. Luckily, the film constantly betrays itself through its highly sophisticated show-biz manners. Jesus is not simply the androgynous circus clown He looks to be. As played by Victor Garber, He's a tireless hoofer and a most engaging minstrel man. One of the finest production numbers I've seen in years is the exuberant and ironic ""All for the Best,"" which Jesus and John the Baptist (David Haskell) sing and dance all over New York, highlighted by a marvelous soft-shoe done in front of the Bulova Watch sign overlooking Times Square.After a certain point, all of Stephen Schwartz's music begins to sound the same, but there is a momentum in its pacing that carries us over the monotony. Almost every member of the cast has his or her moment of glory at screen center. I think particularly of Robin Lamont, a beautiful honey blonde, who sings ""Day by Day,"" and of several hugely funny parables acted out by virtually the entire company.John-Michael Tebelak, who is credited with having ""conceived and staged"" the Off Broadway show, is credited as associate director of the film, and David Greene as its director. I have no idea who did what, but the movie has the look of something shot by Richard Lester in an evangelical frame of mind. Ordinarily, this sort of fractured style is something I can easily resist, but it is the only way, I suspect, that ""Godspell"" could be made to work on film.Every song number is an amalgam of splintery shots against dozens of New York locations, and a lot of them are both funny and beautiful. I can't remember another film that seems to have caught the way New York appears on a lot of hot summer days, when its jagged outlines are softened by a golden smog. The atmosphere may be lethal, but it's also incomparably romantic.I have some of these same feelings of ambivalence about ""Godspell."" I like its music, its drive and its determination, even when it's pretending to a kind of innocence and naivet that I never for a second believe.",1973-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Exurban Horror:A Community Takes on Army in 'The Crazies',"The citizens of Evans City are in a fix, but they don't know it. The Army plane that recently crashed nearby was carrying some deadly bacteria that have poisoned the water supply. The symtoms of the illness: uncontrollable giggles followed by madness and probably death.Thus begins ""The Crazies,"" an inept science-fiction film from George A. Romero, the Pittsburgh man who established himself as the Grandma Moses of exurban horror films with ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" a movie whose stark, primitive style has made it into a classic of low camp.Like that earlier film, ""The Crazies"" was shot near Pittsburgh with a bunch of actors who perform with the kind of hysterical enthusiasm I haven't seen in 30 years, not since viewing a grade-school production of ""Six Who Pass While the Lentils Boil,"" in which one young actor fell off the stage into the orchestra pit.The film's real subject is not bacteriological weaponry, or the idiocies of the military, but the collapse of a community presented as a spectacle, prompted when the Army moves to quarantine Evans City without explaining what's wrong.The soldiers, who wear gas masks all the time (though the poison is in the water supply), shoot the citizens on sight. The citizens begin shooting soldiers on sight. Here and there, people go mad. A priest immolates himself, and the Army commander shouts: ""You must get the President on the phone! We've got to get a nuclear weapon over that town!"" The scientist who developed the bacteria despairs: ""Jesus Christ! This is so random!"" Toward the end, his beautiful lab assistant quietly asks: ""Just how would you rate our chances, doctor?""The film opened yesterday at the Forum, the UA Eastside Cinema and the UA East Theater.",1973-03-24T05:00:00+0000

All counterpointed by growing plants. The trend is most noticeable among young people on limited budgets who do not use the services of interior designers. New styles and new designs have never been the strong point of unpainted furniture, but this, too, may be changing. A new wall storage system (9) designed by architect Karlis Grinbergs of Cambridge, Mass., who works with Buckminster Fuller, is a bright spot in the usual jumble of lookalike chests and bookcases. And the style range in unpainted pieces has been expanded to include such fashionable items as chairs and armoires in simple provincial designs and many of the bentwood classics. There are even lineforline reproductions of Shaker furniture, sold by mail in kit form, that retain much of the charm of the museumquality pieces they are copied from. Pricerather than qualityis still the magnet that draws people to unfinished furniture. One has to shop around. And better  constructed pieces are more costly than crude ones. Traditional designs are more expensive than simple modern ones. On the whole, though, the savings may be as much as 30 to 50 per cent over the equivalent finished piece. Furniture in kits can be a real bargain.

At a highlevel meeting in the office of then Under Secretary of the Navy John Warner, the company's chairman submitted a letter drafted by its Washington lawyer (himself a former General Counsel of the Navy). The company, the letter said, was neither willing nor able to put up more money toward delivery of the destroyers. Therefore, it was incumbent on the Department of the Navy to come up with the needed cash or the shipyard would simply stop work. When the company officials had been asked to leave the room, the admiral in charge of shipbuilding told Warner the contractor's demand for an extra $10million on the spot and $4million soon afterward was reasonable and ought to be paid. There seemed to be general agreement. But then a ruddy, expensively but conservatively dressed civilian interrupted. Admiral, he said, over my dead body will you reform that contract and give them $10million.

Within the broad spectrum of political theory and practice which characterizes feminism in 1973, Betty Friedan stands at the most conservative and peripheral point, and her constituency among feminists has declined proportionately as the movement has extended its vision from reformism to revolutionary social change and has increased its numbers through consciousness of and relevance to the oppression of working class, Third World and lesbian women. Friedan's prediction in McCall's last summer of sexual McCarthyism, of sexist reaction to women's militancy, has come true: and in fact she has fulfilled her prophecy by becoming the prime reactionary voice.",1973-03-25T05:00:00+0000

He is also board chairman of the National Opera Institute, which finances opera projects and singers. The important aspect of spreading myself all over the place, Rudel said the other day in announcing his City Opera plans for next season, is the crossfertilization of opera ideas and productions that it allows.

Ever since the Byrds first started using electrified folk and country instrumental styles and vocal harmonies (around 1964), and from the time the pedal steel guitar and fiddle became regular components of many rock bands, it has become respectable to have a Nashville twang in your music. In 1969 Bob Dylan gave the Southern influence an additional push north with his album, Nashville Skyline. Currently, radio and television commercials are just dripping with the sounds and voices of the Grand Ole Opry's top performers, and movies such as Deliverance are using bluegrass tunes as the basis for their scores (Bonnie and Clyde did the same thing a few years back).*Recent indications around New York City also point to a rapidly increasing interest in country music. As Peter McCabe recently pointed out in these pages, radio station WEN is devoting all of its music programming to country. The first appearance at Max's Kansas City by a major, Nashville artist, Waylon Jennings, brought long lines of people for most of the shows. Tom T. Hall has been to Carnegie Hall.

us,"A Good, Tuneful Time With 'Tom': Tom Sawyer'","MARK TWAIN once described ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" as ""simply a hymn, put into prose form to give it a worldly air."" The new musical version, adapted by Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman, who also wrote the score together, may be just a little too worldly for some people. About half of the songs supplied by the Sherman brothers mightwith different lyrics and orchestrationshave turned up in any number of other, considerably inferior Sherman musicals from ""Mary Poppins"" to ""Charlotte's Web."" The small, ageless boy who plays TomJohnny Whitakeris a TV veteran, as well as a Disney graduate, and it shows. He looks right, but he has a practically Merman-like drive to please and the mannerisms of someone trying to time his actions to match a canned laughtrack.Yet with all of the worldliness of this ""Tom Sawyer,"" there remains the memory of a perfect innocence that is very much the sense of Twain's ""The Adventures of Tom ""Sawyer."" It's a memory prompted more by longing than by fact, and it's very much a part of the Hollywood movie tradition from which ""Tom Sawyer"" is derived. Carry that tradition back far enough and you'll run into the earliest Our Gang comedies, which were never about the way childhood ever was, but the way Mack Sennett and his gang knew that it should have been.Most of the movies that have come out of this tradition, and most of the child actors who became stars in them, have been awful. It is to the credit of the Sherman brothers and Don Taylor, who directed ""Tom Saywer,"" that they've made a film that manages to evoke the fears, joys, triumphs and disasters of childhood within a tradition that usually deals in forced anthropomorphosis, insisting that children act like small-scale humans with hormone deficiencies.There have been few intelligent American films about childhoodcertainly nothing on the order of Vigo's ""Zero de Conduit"" or Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" or even Reed's ""The Fallen Idol,"" and there have been few performances by children in American films to match those in any number of European films. Offhand, I can think of only Richie Andrusco in Morris Engel's ""Little Fugitive"" and isolated moments of Margaret O'Brien in Vincente Minnelli's ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" It's not that European children are naturally better actors, nor that European directors are better at directing children. Rather it has to do with the fantasy-feeding function (then as well as now) of American films aimed at mass audiences, as opposed to the more idiosyncratic aims of the better European directors, who probably sent their children to see American films on Saturday afternoons.Twain's ""Tom Sawyer,"" as marvelous as it is, is essentially Saturday afteroon fiction, at least compared to ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" which was published in 1884, eight light-years after the appearance of ""Tom Sawyer."" The two novels share authorship and character names, but fundamentally they have little else in common. ""Tom Sawyer"" is a timeless lark in a Hannibal, Missouri, remembered as Eden but called St. Petersburg. Tom is, at heart, a rather impossible little superman masquerading as a normal boy who plays hookey, beats up boys who wear clean clothes, tells small lies at his own convenience, worships women as creatures from another planet, captures villains and, generally, goes from triumph to triumph, improving a world that isn't so terrible to start with.The Huck Finn of the later novel is someone who barely survives, and the novel itself is an adventure in a world of greed, hunger, violence and arbitrary cruelty, in which even the buffoonery is never as innocent as it seems. To enjoy what the Shermans and Mr. Taylor have accomplished in ""Tom Sawyer"" is to remember that they weren't making ""Huckleberry Finn,"" but a kind of pageant glorifying an idealized time (boyhood) and place (the American Middle West in the first half of the 19th century). This they do with such immense verve and great high spirits that they effectively transform a tradition without ever breaking with it.The look of the production has a lot to do with the film's success. Mr. Taylor shot the film entirely on location in Missouri, mostly in and around the village of Arrow Rock, which serves as Hannibal, and on the Missouri River, which doubles nicely as the Mississippi. Everything is a little bigger, brighter, more colorful than life, but that's the way a pageant should be. Houses are roomy and spotless (the only shabby thing is the fence Tom must whitewash). Trees are perfect for climbing and the weather remains ideal. It is such a lovely spot that it doesn't seem at all odd that people might express themselves in song, nor that the big holiday picnicwhich precedes the cave confrontation of Injun Joe with Tom and Becky Thatchershould turn into a huge, exuberant production number. By golly, it really would have been good to be alive then!With the exception of Joshua Hill Lewis, who plays Tom's tattle-tale Cousin Sid with a very funny, pudgy sort of pushiness, all of the younger actors give standard though never horrid performances. The old folk, however, are fine, including Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly, Warren Oates as Muff Potter, and Lucille Benson as the Widow Douglas, the foolish lady whose mission in life becomes the reformation of Huck Finn.Although the Shermans' screenplay eliminates most of Twain's philosophizing about Tom's not-too-deeply hidden virtues, it retains the identify of Injun Joe, played by Kunu Hank, as ""that murderin' half-breed.""Twain was full of all kinds of prejudices that today would be insupportable, but Injun Joe, the outcast, is not one of them. He is a man with an evil heart, and that's all there is to it, though the film does make a case for how he got that way. Mostly, the people in the film are exactly the way they are because God made them so.""Tom Sawyer"" has little truck with psychological complexities and contradictions. It is as direct an expression of faith as ""Rock of Ages,"" which the Hannibal citizensin one of the film's best momentssing at Tom and Huck's funeral with a little more gusto than the apparent grief of the occasion should properly allow.",1973-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A New Truffaut: Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me' Arrives,"When Stanislas Previne (Andre Dussolier), a conventionally shy young sociollogist, arrives at the prison to gather material for his thesis, ""Criminal Women,"" the matron tries to dissuade him from interviewing Camille Bliss. Instead, the matron suggests that he talk to the inmate who cut her men victims into pieces or to the inmate who strangled men with one hand. Stanislas persists, and the haughty matron says of Camille: ""She's just a tramp.""The matron's absolutely right. Camille (Bernadette Lafont) is brassy, vulgar, talks in clichs, is not strikingly pretty and not in the first bloom of youth, but she possesses several other qualities that drive some men wild.Like poor tubercular Mildred in ""Of Human Bondage,"" Camille is so intensely self-absorbed that the selfishness amounts to a sexual challenge. Most important, perhaps, Camille has a smashing figure, one that seems to have little relation to the bird-brain that directs it, a figure that looks particularly great in slips and unbuttoned blouses and is seemingly impervious to assaults by men or time.Franois Truffaut's newest comedy, ""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me,"" is the story of Camille's wild rise to fame and fortune as a singing star of absolutely no talent, in a world that cares less for performance onstage than for achievements off. Camille's rue to success is littered with corpses, including those of her father and her mother-in-law and one marvelously manic suitor (Charles Denner), a rat exterminator who had known from the age of 9 what he wanted to be.Camille doesn't consider herself a murderer. She just sets up situations that can if she's lucky  result in certain disadvantages to others.""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me"" is a very curious and disappointing movie. It has wit, but it's not very funny. It is too schematically predictable ever to be surprising except in minor details. Its woefully comic attitude toward the triumph of second-rateness is not of an especially interesting order. Nor, I suspect, does it come naturally to Truffaut, whose films  even the so-called failures like ""The Soft Skin,"" ""The Bride Wore Black"" and ""Mississippi Mermaid""  posses a poetic complexity seldom achieved by other directors' successes.In the entire film, there are just two scenes that are worthy of anything in his earlier films: a moment that is almost shocking in its suggestion of recognizable feeling, when Stanislas takes his leave of Camille in prison, where he's been taping her story and falling in love with her, and another, purely comic moment toward the end when a scholarly 10-year-old film director refuses to let strangers look at his unedited ""rushes.""I have such admiration for Truffaut's intelligence that I can't believe that perhaps what I take to be failures in ""Such a Gorgeous Kid like Me"" might not be his purposeful decisions. Bernadette Lafont, who was in Truffaut's first short film, ""Les Mistons,"" is a singularly uninteresting actress. She's sort of horsy and loud, incapable of anything resembling a small gesture. But then (I think to myself), perhaps that is just the quality he wantedin order to make Camille's triumph that much more grotesque.The decision may be intellectually correct, but it squashes the comedy, which is not especially inventive to start with. It also puts a burden on the actors who play Camille's victims, only one of whom, Denner, catches the exuberant spirit of the piece, which is too often simply frenzied. One of Truffaut's great talents, especially evident in ""Shoot the Piano Player"" and ""Stolen Kisses,"" is his way of parsing any mood into its components of comedy, tragedy, put-on and poetry. ""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me"" is a single comic mood, repeated with variations, shrilly.",1973-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Lelouch's Sly 'Money' Is a Clever Satire,"Claude Lelouch's ""Money, Money, Money"" is such a bright, clever comedy-satire that the writer-director can be forgiven toward the end, when he almost beats the horse  his joke  to death. This is a sly, funny picture, but nothing like Lelouch's lyrical ""A Man and a Woman""whose sessiness and visual punctuation of slapstick outride patches of arid blandness and a fade-out when he simply pelts us with his point.It goes like this. Why shouldn't present-day pirates, banding together in Paris, pluck profit from a chaotic society jangling with ideologies, causes and trends? Materialism, spelled money, is at the root, and this is what the five knaves go after, with brash success and a few ironic snags.The first part of the picture is the most freshly inventive, with the blithe crooks converging, careening around in cars (Mack Sennett-style), heisting a corporation safe (in the neatest trick of the year) and kidnapping a pop singer, then an ambassador.This last stunt, overlapping a plane hijacking, involves the men with a bearded South American revolutionary, whose ideals are acutely hitched to the value of a dollar. This is the sharpest section but blandness sets in until Lelouch whisks the story and tone into broad, breezy comedy. The ending is a nimble surprise. If only Lelouch had let go.Technically, the movie is first-rate. As the brazen, carefree culprits, Lino Ventura, Charles Denner, Jacques Brel (toothsomely alive and well), Charles Grard and Aldo Maccione are amusing indeed.

us,Screen: Nurevev in 'I Am a Dancer:Beast/Classicist Aspect of Dancer Is Ignored,"Rudolf Nureyev  onstageis both magnificent beast and great classicist. It is this animal quality held in check by superb discipline that makes hs performances so exciting. No other ballet dancer has this tension of leashed power straining against schooled excellence.Yet this is not the Nureyev you will see in ""I Am a Dancer,"" a firm that attempts to show his versatility in four types of ballets, but perversely ignores the base upon which his reputation rests.For ultimately Nureyev will be remembered not only for the high technical standard of male dancing he brought to the West from Russia in 1961, but as a great clascial dancer in the 19th century ballet classics.Something of the excitement Nureyev can bring to these old ballets flickers through the last minute of this film. He is seen leaping around the stage in a performance of the Royal Ballet's ""Sleeping Beauty."" All the splendor and brilliance of the classical ballet tradition is there and Nureyev is part of it.This is what Pierre Jourdan, the French director of this French-British production, fails to demonstrate, perhaps because he does not really understand the one full ballet and three excerpts in which he presents Nureyev so uncharacteristically.The first sequence is from ""La Sylphide,"" an 1836 Romantic ballet by the Danish choreographer Auguste Bournonville, in which Nureyev and Carla Fracci, one of today's best Sylphides, establish no rapport whatsoever. ""La Sylphide"" has only recently entered Nureyev's repertory, and it was perhaps unwise to record him in a Bournonville ballet. This is a delicate work that depends on image more than on virtuosity, and the camera wrongly stresses footwork over atmosphere.A more tedious ballet, paradoxically, provides the film with moments of great interest. Nureyev, now quite anxious to move into the modern-dance field, is seen rehearsing a duet with Deanne Bergama from ""Field Figures,"" by the contemporary American choreographer Glen Tetley, and he brings to it an overwhelming physicality. Of course, all this huffing and puffing is unnecessary, but his refusal to spare himself or his body is absolutely fascinating.There is a hint of what makes Nureyev Nureyev in the complete filmed version of Sir Frederick Ashton's ""Marguerite and Armand."" Yet Ashton is too good a choreographer to be judged by this schmaltzy reworking or ""Camille,"" and Nureyev and Dame Margot Fonteyn, acting and dancing their hearts out, have more to offer in ballet than hand-wringing and cape-flinging. Having chosen a literary ballet, the film underscores its weakness by providing it with narration.In the fourth sequence, Lynn Seymour and Nureyev appear to be greeted with canned applause in dancing the grand pas de deux of ""Sleeping Beauty"" on an empty stage ordinarily filled with other dancers. This was Mr. Jourdan's chance to show Nureyev at his best. But the resplendence of a famous ballet showpiece is destroyed through a shabby and dark setting.The dance sequences are linked by offstage glimpses of Nureyev, replete with the nonsense non-Russians say about Russians (for instance, the idea that Nureyev's international bookings can be traced to the nomadic instinct of his Tartar ancestry). Nothing is to be gleaned about Nureyev's personal life here, but he does seem to be a regular fellow in Fonteyn's and Ashton's presence.There is one wonderful flash of spontaeity as he clears a way among his fans by swatting them with a long-stemmed rose. Nureyev is one of those people who make the world more interesting than it often is. Even a bad film about him can't all that bad.""I Am a Dancer"" opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater.",1973-03-29T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Phedre' Is a Graceful Homage to Racine,"Pierre Jourdan's adaptation of Racine's ""Phdre,"" with the French text translated by English subtitles taken from William Packard's alexandrine translation, is surprisingly interesting and unhackneyed for a film devoted to a kind of drama so completely at odds with what films are supposed to be about.Seventeenth-century French neoclassic drama requires a certain discipline even when you watch it in a legitimate theater, where the uncomfortable seats and bad sight lines help keep you awake. In a movie house, I would have expected instant sleep.This ""Phdre,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room (which has alarmingly comfortable seats and very good sight lines), is a graceful homage to a play and a style of performance that, under less attractive circumstances, might have reduced me to the kind of acute, uncontrollable high spirits I sometimes experience at the opera, when the tenor can't get his arms around the soprano.Marie Bell, who has been a star of the Comdie Franaise, of her own theater and of French films for longer than I can remember, comes to us as the unhappy Phdre, tragically in love with her stepson, Hippolyte, in the full bloom of what has alsions expressed in verse from which all easily identifiable passion has been distilledare so intelligently embraced that Miss Bell's age and theatrical mannerisms are less an intrusion than a means of emphasis.Racine's theater deals in emotions almost as if they were abstract principles. It asks us to think first, feel later. Everything about this production directed by Mr. Jourdan (brother of the actor Louis Jourdan) invites such a ready long passed middle age.Yet the artificialities of the filmfrom its Poussin-like painted backdrops to its preoccupation with grand pas-distancing of response. The effect, if you can overcome an initial resistance, is soothing and reassuring, as if you'd been taken away from time.The camera glides about the colonnaded interior of Theseus's palace with a kind of discreet insistence that we pay attention. Only occasionly does it move in for tight close-ups or take one of those ladder-high positions from which birds and movie cameras view the world. Mostly, however, the camera, the sets, the costumes and the actors are simply instruments used in the cause of the playwright, so designed as not to interfere with him grossly.At this point, Miss Bell is somewhat too majestic to be entirely convincing, even at the center of a tragedy of intellect, but she is a living landmark not easily denied. With the exception of Tania Torrens, a beautiful, truly young woman who plays Aricie, the real love of Hippolyte, all of the other actors seem a bit seedy, which may or may not reflect their inability to adapt to film a florid acting style that isn't all that interesting today, even on the stage.",1973-03-30T05:00:00+0000
