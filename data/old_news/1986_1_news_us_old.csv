No one had tried to bring these two things together in that way. So I started over.'' The result was ''The Rise of the Trading State,'' a book the author hopes will lend historical perspective to the trade-offs between economic and military power, and stimulate new debate on the alternatives now facing American policy makers. ''Nations have really always had a choice as they make their way in the world,'' he said.

Count 'em: ''Top Hat,'' ''Follow the Fleet'' and ''Swing Time.'' ''Top Hat'' (1935) takes off - and seldom subsides - Sunday at 4:30 P.M. on Cinemax and Thursday at 11 A.M. and 7 P.M. on WHT, with the peerless dancers in top form and that wonderful Irving Berlin score. His melodic batch for ''Follow the Fleet'' (1936) - Monday at 10 A.M. and 6 P.M. on Cinemax - doesn't match it, with a single, haunting exception: ''Let's Face the Music and Dance.'' It's one of the team's great terpsichore turns and not a bad theme song for a new year. The dance is a stately pantomime pairing two luckless strangers. At the end, they stroll away then suddenly dip forward, backs arched, for a high kick toward the future. It makes a thrilling coda.",1986-01-05T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"LIVES OF THE POETS, by E. L. Doctorow. (Avon, $3.95.) The six stories that begin the book seem unconnected, our reviewer, Benjamin DeMott, wrote in 1984. Yet the novella that follows, about a successful but estranged middle-aged writer, ''strikingly fuses them,'' and ''feelings that earlier were enigmatic are re-experienced as pointedly intense. And as preoccupations of the stories converge, like rays, in the novella's lens, they confirm the existence of levels of passion and idealism in the writer that were initially screened off by the witty surface of his monologue.'' The book's distinction ''lies in the gradual, patiently deliberated, austerely self-effacing unfolding of a moral core.'' THE QUALITY OF MERCY: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience, by William Shawcross. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) The British journalist William Shawcross turns his attention to the world's response to the catastrophic hunger and disease that engulfed Cambodia's people in 1979 after years of Khmer Rouge terror and an invasion by the Vietnamese. Aryeh Neier, writing in The Book Review two years ago, said ''The Quality of Mercy'' ''may well be the best account we have of the politics of international charity.'' This edition also includes a report on the Ethiopian famine. THE STREET, by Ann Petry. (Beacon, $8.95.) Ann Petry's novel of life in Harlem, first published in 1946, describes a young woman's valiant struggle to make a good life for herself and her young son despite the hunger, disease and violence around them. It is a story of ''memorable simplicity and power,'' Alfred Butterfield wrote in these pages, and he also called it ''a gripping tale peopled with utterly believable United States citizens, and overflowing with the classic pity and terror of good imaginative writing.''",1986-01-05T05:00:00+0000

The end of this long engagement with the excellent piano accompaniment of Wes McAfee, comes at a time when Miss Lea is putting a fine polish on an observant and probing singing career that has been developing, sometimes hesitantly, for 30 years. She has become one of the most knowledgeable interpreters and collectors of popular songs and her voice has grown to accommodate the increasingly demanding directions in which she has moved. Last Friday evening, which is her performing night through Jan. 24, her program included Lea interpretations of familiar songs, a little known Rodgers and Hart song (''Baby's Awake Now''), contemporary songs (''Twilight World,'' a moody, misty joint effort by Marion McPartland and Johnny Mercer), a song from Kurt Weill's unfinished musical version of ''Huckleberry Finn,'' as well as observations on the idiosyncrasies of singers, such as adding ''yuh'' to a line, as in ''I Loves You, Porgy -Yuh!'' Miss Lea resists stereotypes - she builds a sunny and surprisingly suitable sense of calm in the usually senuous ''Begin the Beguine'' and manages to create a real song out of the seemingly phony fluff of ''Limehouse Blues.'' Her voice, which has worn and husky overtones, opens up cleanly and fully when the occasion calls for it; in controlled, shaded fashion on ''I Never Has Seen Snow'' or rising to whooping exuberance in ''Applejack,'' a song of seduction by Weill and Maxwell Anderson.",1986-01-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Music/Noted in Brief; Lance Mulcahy Sets Shakespeare to Music,"Lance Mulcahy, the Australian composer of ''Sweet Will,'' has taken on the formidable task of setting some of the greatest verses ever written to contemporary pop melodies. ''Sweet Will,'' a musical revue whose text is based entirely on Shakespeare, is the composer's follow-up to his 1981 show, ''Shakespeare's Cabaret,'' which won a Tony nomination for best musical score. Though the new show further reveals Mr. Mulcahy to be a versatile, melodically inventive composer, his marriage of Elizabethan poetry and contemporary pop, is an awkward mismatch. ''Sweet Will,'' which opened Sunday at the New Silver Lining Theater (349 West 46th Street), sets lyrics from 11 Shakespearean plays, including four songs from ''The Tempest,'' three from ''Twelfth Night'' and two each from ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ''As You Like It.'' The 80-minute, two-act show also includes an adaptation of Shakespeare's early narrative poem, ''Venus and Adonis'' and musical settings of seven sonnets. Mr. Mulcahy's stylistic range encompasses delicate folk-pop (''Where the Bee Sucks''), Fats Waller-influenced pop-jazz (''All That Glisters''), Chopinesque ballads (''Take, Oh Take Those Lips Away''), country music (''O Mistress Mine'') and reggae (''Hey, Ho, the Wind and the Rain''). A cast of four actor-singers, including the pop-soul vocalists Keith Amos and Rosalyn Burrough, the tenor Stephen Lehew and the soprano Stephanie Cotsirilos, have strong enough voices to be able to sing without microphones, and Michael Ward's ingenious arrangements weave electric and acoustic keyboards, guitar and percussion into settings that scale contemporary pop sounds down in volume to Elizabethan proportions.",1986-01-06T05:00:00+0000

Larouche was the Rangers' leading scorer the season before last, and the Rangers, one of the lowest-scoring teams in the National Hockey League, desperately need a scorer. ''Pierre feels frustrated he's in the minor leagues,'' Patrick said yesterday. ''But he hasn't gone down and blown the American League out of the water. He has 34 points, but the leading scorer has 63. We sent Mike Allison down and he scored 7 points in 5 games. We need Pierre at a 50-goal pace because he does have other liabilities.'' Larouche, playing for Hershey, has 20 goals in 27 games, which would translate into a pace of 60 goals for an 80-game season. The center, who scored 48 goals for the Rangers in the 1983-84 season but dropped off to 24 last season, was demoted just before the start of the season.

Illustrated. 224 pp. Columbia: University of Missouri Press. $48. A dubious dividend of the current revival of Realism is the comeback of the Regionalist school, a group of painters who in the 1930's and 40's created on canvas their own cozy folklore of American life. Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975), who had once been a promising Modernist but vociferously renounced that credo, was one of the school's principals. His resuscitation is evident in the 1982 reissue of his autobiography, ''An Artist in America,'' by the University of Missouri Press, the big exhibition of his work organized last year by Bard College and the installation of his busy 10-panel mural, ''America Today,'' as the sole lobby adornment of the new Equitable Life Assurance tower on Seventh Avenue and 51st Street. And now we have ''Tom Benton and His Drawings,'' an expansive (and expensive) book whose folksy text by Karal Ann Marling, professor of art history and American studies at the University of Minnesota, accompanies some 200 of his working drawings.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

D., Knoxville, Tenn. Answer:A New Zealand tourist official explains that the Milford Track Walk and the Freedom Track Walk are along the same trail. The names distinguish the different hikers' huts - and different prices - that apply. Both walks are organized by the Tourist Hotel Corporation of New Zealand in cooperation with the Fiordland National Park, the site of the trail, in South Island. (The 3,761-square-mile park, which contains many sounds, mountains rivers and lakes, is the largest in New Zealand.) Hikers who go on the escorted Milford Track Walk, a five-day package, need only carry personal belongings. Meals are provided and linens are supplied during their three nights in huts along the 33-mile route, which runs from Te Anau Lake to Milford Sound. The fourth night is spent at a hotel in Milford Sound. The cost is about $275, and $188 for children under 15. The Freedom Track Walk is for hikers prepared to carry their sleeping bags, food and cooking utensils. They stay at three huts other than those used on the Milford package, and the huts are not equipped with linens. No guide is provided. The cost is about $30 a person. Whichever plan hikers choose, they must register at the T.H.C. Te Anau Hotel before setting out.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

In the plains of the Great Rift Valley now shared between Kenya and Tanzania, virtually all Masai boys grow to manhood tending the family cattle herds. Tepilit Ole Saitoti, a Masai in his late 30's, emerges as an unusual warrior in this short autobiography. Mr. Saitoti was marked by his father's decision to send him to a missionary school. The consequences of this act form the basis for a tale of remarkable separations and accommodations among several cultures. His African teachers pressure him to reject ''traditional'' points of view and he is even baptized against his father's wishes. Failing secondary school examinations, he returns to tribal life an uninitiated male, and the path to his becoming a warrior is hammered out within the emotional complexity of life in a family compound. Able to speak Swahili and English, he is in continuing contact with the edges of the world his father and elders refuse to comprehend. Even after he attains the rank of warrior by single-handedly killing a lioness, desire for knowledge of that world compels him to run off to the Serengeti National Park in Kenya where he becomes a ranger and guide and is eventually the subject of a National Geographic Society film. All of this occurs by the time he is 20 years old and is a prelude to a journey that takes him to Europe and the United States.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"HONORING THE NOVELIST Over a Century Ago The first United States geneal issue consists of two stamps, a 5-cent most commonly found in a red brown color and a 10-cent black. Authorized by act of Congress on March 3, 1847, the non-mandatory use of stamps to evidence prepayment of postage took effect July 1, 1847. As might be expected, these first United States stamps are avidly sought by collectors.   At the time the first stamps went into use, the 5-cent issue met the rate for single letters sent less than 300 miles. The 10-cent rate applied to longer distances. Single letters were those that weighed a half-ounce or less with every additional half-ounce being assessed an additional single rate of postage. If not prepaid, the postage fee was charged to the recipient of the letter.   Because the government did not have stamp printing facilities of its own, the work on the first stamps was contracted out to Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson, a New York City company engaged in Bank Note engraving. Production delays ensued and the first stamps were available only in the New York post office on their effective date. Because of this first day scarcity, no covers are known to exist with a July 1, 1847 cancel. Earliest known use of the 10-cent is July 2. The 5-cent has been found with a July 7 earliest known usage.   The 5-cent issue features a portrait of Benjamin Franklin, the first Postmaster General of the United States. The stamp was issued without perforations on a thin, bluish wove paper. ''The Unted State Postage Stamps of the 19th Century'' by Lester G.Brookman attributes to the late Dr. Carroll Chase the study which ''dates'' the first issue by color. The 1847 printings are orange brown, bright orange brown, dark brown and black brown, while the late (1851) printings are deep brownish orange and dark brownish orange. An expert can date the printing of a given example by its color and the sharpness of the printing impression The Brookman book provides an example of the growth in value of this issue. A rare piece described as a rejoined block of six of the 5-cent 1847 in used condition is noted as having sold in 1966 for $1,159. The same piece, which was rejoined around 1918 when the late Stanley Ashbrook discovered a mate for his vertical strip of three in the collection of Judge Robert Emerson, was last offered at auction in 1982. It realized $32,000 in the Daniel F. Kelleher United States Rare Samp Collection auction.   The 10-cent issue bears George Washington's portrait. The stamp is extremely rare in unused condition, carrying a Scott catalogue value of $18,500. Important usages include the 10-cent bisect on cover, used to meet the 5-cent rate, which catalogues for $15,000 or more. The 10-cent and 5-cent used on the same cover are assigned a catalogue value of $18,500.   There are no known dangerous fakes of the 5-cent 1847 issue. Counterfeits of the 10-cent produced by the famous forger Jean de Sperati can be identified by a diagonal line towards the bottom of the left frame line. Fake bisect covers have also been manufactured and are best left to independent experts for detection.   Other potential problems exist in the mis-identification of unused 1875 official government reprints as the more valuable 1847 originals and the passing off of used stamps as unused issues after attempts have been made to wash off the cancellation. The reprints are easily identified when compared with known originals. Verification of unused 1847's should be left to experts although close examination of the front and back of a 5-cent may reveal the cancel, usually a pen-manuscripted ''X'' or diagonal line in the center of the stamp. Because of the black color of the 10-cent stamp, detecting cleaned cancels of this issue is more difficult.   With the reduction in postage rates that took effect July 1, 1851, the 1847 issue was demonitized as of that date. In the four years of use, approximately 3,700,000 5-cent stamps and 865,000 10-cent stamps were sold to the public. This compares with the 120,000,000 copies of each commemorative that are sold.   As with all early issues in limited supply, condition varies greatly with this issue. Value follows directly. A used 5-cent in top condition with wide margins can sell for $1,000 or more, while a damaged, but collectible copy can be had for as little as $50. The 10-cent used can range from $200 to $2,000 or more.   For the budget-minded, attractive reproductions can be found on the 1947 Centenary International Philatelic Exhibition (Cipex) souvenir sheet that has a value of $1.50. The colors are different, but the designs are much the same as the originals.","The Postal Service issued yesterday a 25-cent stamp honoring Jack London. The stamp was issued in Glen Ellen, Cal., the author's home in his later life and now the site of the Jack London State Historic Park. Mr. London's biographer, Russ Kingman, and Nancy L.

Three days ago, I learned that such a unit had been vacated. I called the agent and was told the owner isn't transferring tenants to vacant apartments. Can he refuse such a request? . . . D. G., Manhattan Answer: Yes, he can. There is nothing in the state rent regulations that requires a landlord to allow tenants to move to larger units, according to Thomas Viola, assistant commissioner in the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Seepage in a Co-op Question: Water has seeped through the outside walls of my co-op apartment. The managing agent has agreed to replaster the affected areas, but has refused to repaint. He keeps quoting the words ''proprietary lease.'' Who should pay for painting? . . . J. A. S., Riverdale, the Bronx Answer: Most proprietary leases say a tenant is responsible for painting and decoration of his apartment and the co-op board is responsible for repairs to the building's structure.

us,"FROM THE PENTAGON, AN ULTIMATE BATTLE PLAN","THE military is rarely very explicit about how the United States would wage war with the Soviet Union. But now Adm. James D. Watkins, the Chief of Naval Operations, has provided an unusually candid glimpse of the tactics being considered in Pentagon war rooms. In an article published by the United States Naval Institute, he acknowledged that in a major nonnuclear conflict the Navy might seek to attack Soviet submarines carrying nuclear missiles. Such a strategy, conceded Admiral Watkins, the first nuclear submarine officer to rise to the Navy's top job, ''is not without risk.'' Some analysts maintain that the risks would in fact be considerable, and that the strategy could lead the Soviet Union to respond with nuclear weapons. Following are excerpts from the admiral's article, ''The Maritime Strategy'': The United States is inevitably a maritime nation, and the United States and its Navy have inescapable global responsibilities. A carefully designed strategy has always been an imperative, but the need for a sound strategy has grown all the more important as the Soviets developed a formidable blue-water Navy able to challenge U.S. interests worldwide. Accordingly, three years ago, we reviewed our extant strategy - a strategy with broad contours reasonably well understood, but one which had not been submitted to the rigor inherent in codification. The result of that effort was the Maritime Strategy.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

Small boats, which once were used largely as yacht tenders, are becoming the bread and butter of the boating industry. Both powerboat and sailboat manufacturers are thriving on small-boat sales. The National Marine Manufacturers Association, which is sponsoring the 76th edition of the show at the New York Coliseum, reports that an outboard runabout is the best-selling boat in the business. Part of the reason is the price. An 18-foot fiberglass boat with a 35-horsepower engine and boat trailer retails for about $6,600, the equivalent of a low-cost compact car.

By Charles Simic. 186 pp. New York: George Braziller. Cloth, $14.95. Paper, $8.95. A SENSE of specific place is essential to Dave Smith, but different times flow together in his work. As he says in ''Tide Pools,'' ''I duck under in time, holding my breath.'' So, when asked about poetic influence, he often tends to cite such medieval poems as ''The Seafarer'' and ''The Wanderer,'' gloomy 10th-century songs of isolation set in seascapes one imagines filmed by the young Ingmar Bergman. They are meditations on wyrd, or fate, spoken as darkness endlessly approaches over the hwaelweg (whale-way) by weary outcasts who are nostalgic for home and brood alliteratively over wintry waves. Such poems resound in Dave Smith's work, not only in his occasional use of the Old English alliterative line, but in the fatalistic conviction of isolation beneath his celebrations of familial love and masculine courage. He is sometimes blunt to a fault: ''The truth is we were alone, and are,'' while - he says in another wyrd-obsessed poem - ''unbearable stars yet wheel / in bright, ubiquitous malice.''",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

According to the company's co-directors, Carole Rothman and Robyn Goodman, these are plays they think ''deserve to be seen again - in a new and surprisingly different light.'' Often that ''light'' is not so much a radically altered production as simply a change in venue and in time. These are not necessarily rediscoveries but, rather, plays that might have been overlooked and should be performed again. A decade, or even a few years, can make all the difference in the public perception. At a certain point, a theme can seem overly familiar; a surfeit of family plays, for example, can cause a drama, perhaps even a serious one, to be slighted. A play can be victimized by coincidence. A world event can make a subject seem trivial in comparison, or a certain style of writing can become unfashionable, at least for a time. Attitudes can change toward playwrights.

On Shora, a water world with no dry land and no males, self-awareness and ecological awareness are so linked that the inhabitants refer to themselves as Sharers; whole-hearted participation in the planet-wide web of life is not an ideal or a goal for Sharers but a source of pleasure so intense that they have trouble believing that creatures who cannot ''share'' are human.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

us,A COMEDY OF WORLDLY SALVATION,"THE GOOD APPRENTICE By Iris Murdoch. 522 pp. New York: Viking. $18.95. AT the end of her first book, an enduring study of Jean-Paul Sartre published in 1953, Iris Murdoch prophetically lamented that Sartre's ''inability to write a great novel is a tragic symptom of a situation which afflicts us all.'' Her own inability has extended now through 22 novels, of which the best seem to me ''Bruno's Dream'' (1969), ''The Black Prince'' (1973), ''A Word Child'' (1975) and her latest, ''The Good Apprentice.'' So fecund and exuberant is Miss Murdoch's talent that many more novels may be expected from her. If ''The Good Apprentice'' marks the start of her strongest phase, and it may, then a great novel could yet come, rather surprisingly in the incongruous form of the 19th-century realistic novel. The age of Samuel Beckett and Thomas Pynchon, post-Joycean and post-Faulknerian, is set aside by Miss Murdoch's novelistic procedures, almost as though she thus chose to assert her own direct continuity with the major 19th-century Russian and British masters of fiction.",1986-01-12T05:00:00+0000

At the other extreme is the pedestrian account of the eminent, ranging from the founding fathers to women scientists. Dull, earnest chronology that reduces its subject to stereotype, that sort of biography relies on inflated cliche rather than authentic detail (Nobel Prize week ''passed like a dream'').

The first of these three novellas by the English writer Storm Jameson is the story of a seductress whose own amours provide material for the sexy novels she writes; the second explores a woman's love for a man who is socially beneath her, and the third is about a poor, lonely and embittered middle-aged woman. Harold Strauss wrote in The Times in 1933, ''So completely is she the master of her art, so instinctively the craftsman, so superlatively the selective artist, that a restrained evaluation of her work is difficult for a student of the novel.'' The same publisher has reissued Miss Jameson's 1934 novel COMPANY PARADE ($6.95), about a young woman who has come to London to find work after the Armistice. Reviewers praised its ''fastidiousness of phrase and tight emotional control.'' OLYMPIO: The Life of Victor Hugo, by Andre Maurois. (Carroll & Graf, $12.95.) This biography of the poet and novelist was hailed as a ''major achievement'' that ''stands high among biographies'' by our reviewer, Francis Steegmuller, when it appeared in Gerard Hopkins's translation in 1956. A general's son who grew up in near-palatial surroundings, Hugo led a turbulent existence. His tempestuous love life, Mr. Steegmuller wrote, ''is a veritable Decameron,'' and the triangle formed by Hugo, his wife, Adele, and the critic Sainte-Beuve was ''one of the most famous in French literary history.''

And despite the familiar complaint that there is no audience in New York for serious theater, let alone the classics, this season's schedules boast such illustrious names as Shakespeare and Ibsen, Gorky and Camus.",1986-01-17T05:00:00+0000

She has chosen nine pieces from the repertory of her company, Rachel Lampert and Dancers, with colorful names such as ''Bloody Mary Sunday,'' ''Me and Beethoven'' and ''Doing the Dance.'' Collectively, the evenings are titled ''The Choreographer's Album'' and represent a sort of guided tour of Miss Lampert's repertory. Several artists who have performed with the troupe will return for these reunion programs, among them Holly Harbinger, Michael Blue Aiken, Kenneth Tosti, Erica Eisenberg and Alyce Brochette. The newest work by Miss Lampert, ''Love It, Leave It, or Let It Be Lonely,'' will also be presented, to round out both the evening and the decade. The performances will take place tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8 o'clock at the Nikolais/ Louis DanceSpace, 33 East 18th Street, seventh floor. Admission is $7, or $2 with a Theater Development Fund voucher. Reservations are suggested, and the number for information is 219-1672.

As the curtain rises, we are confronted by an eerie reincarnation of the writer Lillian Hellman - complete with wavy blondish hair, elegant gray suit, pearl necklace, mountainous nose, lighted cigarette and, most unsettling of all, a fierce smile that seems more an invitation to hostilities than an offering of warmth. Makeup, of course, can do wonders, but so can a fine actress. Zoe Caldwell, one of the more estimable actresses around, has surely captured the seething physical presence of Hellman, a woman whose volatile political and personal battles were inseparable from her careers as playwright, screen writer and memoirist.",1986-01-17T05:00:00+0000

And it is especially not because patients today go free, though dependent on drugs, who yesterday were adjudged fit to be tied. The work of the sedated lacks the special quality that would make it Outsider Art -and is to the real thing what mission-school sculpture is to genuine tribal work. Rather, Outsider Art is a useful term because being clinically crazy is not necessarily a prerequisite for genius, although to judge from the recent traveling show of art from the Prinzhorn Collection it certainly helps.",1986-01-17T05:00:00+0000

In 1977 David E. Kaiser, now an associate professor of history at Carnegie-Mellon University, struck up a friendship with William Young, a rare book and art dealer who collected documents bearing on the murder trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the two anarchists whose executions in 1927 caused an international furor. Young was preparing a manuscript based on a huge cache of newly released evidence that the Massachusetts State Police had held for nearly 60 years. When Young died of cancer in 1980, Mr. Kaiser went on to complete the work. ''Postmortem'' is a plodding but persuasive study. Its cumulative effect is to affirm the reputations of ''two innocent men'' who ''most probably were framed for a murder they did not commit.'' The revelations of state police files, grand jury proceedings and prosecution notebooks, the authors conclude, ''show that virtually every piece of evidence against the two men ultimately rested upon falsehoods and fabrications.'' The case began in broad daylight on April 15, 1920, when a pair of payroll bandits gunned down two employees of a shoe factory in South Braintree, Mass., and made off with $15,000. Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian immigrants who had been known to dabble in radical politics, were arrested in May. The prosecution did not have a strong case, but the political climate was favorable for a conviction and the district attorney, Frederick Katzmann, was resourceful.",1986-01-19T05:00:00+0000

In 1885, when Susy Clemens was 13 years old and her beloved father, Mark Twain, was 50, she undertook the task of writing his biography. It begins ''We are a very happy family!'' and ends abruptly in midsentence about a year later. Twain, having just published ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' was at the height of his fame and powers, but the reader sees this only obliquely through Susy's fond but limited childhood gaze. Most of what she describes is domestic - Twain forced by his children to invent stories based on the furniture in the library (thus producing a romance about a fender, tongs and a ''shuvel''); Twain suggesting that Biblical names be used for the chess pieces so he could play on Sunday; Twain cursing while shaving; acting in family charades; writing letters in schoolboy German; and providing names for the many household cats. Susy, who died of spinal meningitis when she was 24, writes of all this with the unaffected warmth and charm of a child and with what her father called her ''frequently desperate'' spelling. After her death, her father annotated her work in his own unmistakable voice, here mellowed by loss and great affection. This is the first publication of Susy Clemens's ''Papa,'' which, as the title page says, has ''a Foreward and Copious Comments by Her Father.'' Twain's remarks, which are interspersed with Susy's, are explanatory, correcting and admiring.",1986-01-19T05:00:00+0000

A rather withdrawn and dour man, he became a hero to most of his colleagues, so much so that even today they scurry to position themselves under his heroic mantle.

Before they incorporated sliding glass doors, Japanese houses filtered the raw glare of daylight through translucent paper shoji screens, except when weather or the desire to admire the garden required exposing the interior to the elements. Even now, when a homeowner can afford them, wood-framed shoji screens mask glass doors and windows in their harsh and unattractive aluminum frames, lending a soft quality to the light, as if everything had been washed with a thinly diluted white pigment. The most characteristic atmospheric quality of outdoor light is similar, a misty subfusion of form and light that derives from the high humidity that Japan experiences much of the year.",1986-01-19T05:00:00+0000

So much for predictions.

Here is a guide to phrases that are commonly used in the classified job advertisements and what they really mean: 1. ''Include salary history'' (where no salary is mentioned in the ad) -The employer is looking to get you cheap. Don't, under any circumstances, include your salary history. If they're interested, they'll call. 2. ''Send resume with earnings history and compensation requirements'' - Not only do they want you cheap, they expect you to bid for the job. Advice: same as above. 3. ''Include salary history'' (where the salary they are offering is mentioned in the ad) - For what purpose? This indicates the employer may simply want to pry into your past. Again, don't give in. 4. ''Salary history a must!'' - No, it isn't. This indicates that many candidates have followed the advice given above and have refused to provide their salary histories. 5. ''Administrative assistant'' -Typist needed. 6. ''Para-professional'' - Clerk needed. 7. ''Strong organizational skills'' -Clerk-typist needed. 8. ''Records analysis specialist'' -File clerk needed. 9. ''Highly visible professional position'' - Receptionist needed. (If the position is so great, why is it advertised in two-point type under ''administrative assistant''?) 10. ''Attractive appearance'' -Euphemism for ''young.'' Those older than 22 need not apply. 11. ''Excellent communications skills required'' - Candidate should be able to read without moving lips. 12. ''People person'' - You will be expected to handle angry and abusive customers or clients without suffering a nervous breakdown. 13.",1986-01-25T05:00:00+0000

In his biography ''Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain,'' Justin Kaplan reports Clemens's version of what God was no doubt saying about Halley's Comet and Mark Twain: ''Here are these unaccountable freaks. . . . They came in together and they must go out together.'' Mr. Kaplan adds, ''Like his Connecticut Yankee, he was 'getting up his last effect': he was to die at sunset on April 21, one day after the comet reached its perihelion.'' Clemens did not exactly stop his breath and die; he was 75 years old and suffering from heart failure.

I swapped four rooms and a bath in 880 square feet for seven rooms and one-and-a-half baths in 2,100 square feet. I traded 7 acres of common property filled with 500 cars for a half-acre of greenery. Monetarily speaking, it was an almost even swap. I surrendered a 6-by-10-foot terrace, concrete with iron railing all around, for a 12-by-25-foot deck, natural wood all around. The terrace was suspended over the Stamford skyline, and for eight years I watched new buildings rise. At the beginning, I thought the development was exciting, but soon the glossy buildings jutted higher and higher and blocked my view of the sound on those moonlit nights when water shimmered with light. My new deck also juts, but over a lawn that slopes gently down into my own small and tangled forest. I counted my trees the other day; I own 78, and I will be adding a few blue spruces.

Someday Harold Robbins is going to wash his mouth out with soap and call it quits, but until then, here comes ''The Storyteller,'' his 19th novel. There are 10 things you need to know before you purchase or don't purchase it, according to your custom. (1) It is possibly autobiographical, at least in part, because when the hero, Joe Crown, an aspiring novelist, is asked what he expects from his career, he replies, ''I want money.'' (2) Most of the words in the book have only one or two syllables (and four or five letters), but in the case of adverbs Mr. Robbins will stretch it to seven syllables or even eight (''unenthusiastically''). (3) The book boasts some hilarious lines, such as ''A good pimp has to be born, not taught.'' (4) This is an adult book in the sense that for plenitude and monotony of sex scenes it could be stocked wherever ''Adult Books'' are sold. (5) As Joe Crown travels from the Brooklyn of 1942 to Hollywood to Europe and the top of his profession -buying his way out of the draft, managing a high-class West Side bordello, climbing in and out of beds and bathtubs, writing in spare moments - he meets few women but many ''girls.'' (6) The only honor observed in the tale is among racketeers. (7) Mr. Robbins's women - well, girls - get slapped around plenty; as Joe explains, ''She probably wanted it.'' (8) Facts are treated cavalierly - in 1949, Audrey Hepburn was not an American movie star, nor were Sophia Loren and Carlo Ponti gossip column fodder. (9) Lesbians abound, but there are no male homosexuals. (10) A more appropriate title, since there isn't much in the way of storytelling, might be ''The Draft Dodger,'' ''The Pimp'' or ''The Best-Selling Author.''",1986-01-26T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Canby asserts that the ''most important battles'' were fought by ''home-grown aristocrats'' in the legislatures, Continental Congresses and drawing rooms of the Colonies.

No subject was too small or personal for the Empress's nagging solicitude, from the consummation of Marie Antoinette's marriage (it took Louis XVI seven years) to her reluctance to wear a corset or read a book. Their 10-year correspondence - selected and impecca-bly translated by Olivier Bernier, a popular writer on the 18th century, under the lurid title ''Secrets of Marie Antoinette'' - is a behind-the-scenes peek at Versailles avant le deluge and an account of a fraught mother-daughter relationship.",1986-01-26T05:00:00+0000

THE GRANITE PAIL The Selected Poems of Lorine Niedecker. Edited and with a preface by Cid Corman. 111 pp. San Francisco: North Point Press. Paper, $11. LORINE NIEDECKER, throughout a literary career of some 50 years, both admired and wrote poems she hoped would stand up against a culture engaged, as she put it, in ''the armed avoidance of quiet.'' She once told the poet Cid Corman, who is the editor of ''The Granite Pail,'' a selection of her poems, ''I want to plant my poems in deep silence.'' Her masters and influences were meditative men and women - Jefferson, Darwin, William Morris, the botanist Asa Gray and more contemporary strategists of poetic silences like Mr. Corman, Basil Bunting and her sometime mentor and correspondent, the Objectivist poet Louis Zukofsky. From them she learned to use contemplation and the absence of noise not as a defense against the world, nor as a form of withdrawal, but as a compositional element, a way of forcing the reader's attention on the precision and subtlety of her verse. Trees, flowers and rivers, in particular those of her native Wisconsin, are among her favorite subjects partly because their growth and development occur without auditory fanfare. In one poem in ''From This Condensery,'' a collection of all her poetry and prose edited by Robert J. Bertholf, the poetic act is likened to the soundlessness of a bird in flight: I was the solitary plover a pencil for a wing-bone From the secret notes I must tilt upon the pressure execute and adjust In us sea-air rhythm.",1986-01-26T05:00:00+0000

IN his recent novel ''Act of Darkness'' (1983), the British author Francis King demonstrated a sure storytelling instinct, expertly using a murder mystery set in colonial India as the scaffolding for a precisely plotted moral tale about corruption and innocence betrayed. Those same gifts, when employed in the short story form, however, tend to point up Mr. King's limitations as a writer: Whereas the novel derived a kind of energy from the author's emphatic narrative drive, the stories seem to suffer from a surfeit of plot twists, melodramatic flourishes and authorial high jinks. Like old-fashioned works by O. Henry, the stories in this volume are continually jabbing the reader with an elbow, as though to say: ''Look at this! See how ironic this ending is. See how blind the characters are. See how superior you and I are for realizing what they will never know.''",1986-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Bruce Weber, the curator of collections at the Norton Gallery of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla. - where the show opened last October - tracked down around 80 paintings and drawings, some rarely seen, in order to provide a stylistic and thematic foundation for the Norton Gallery's ''New York Mural,'' a large and ambitious work painted by Davis in 1932. By including paintings done as early as 1912 and as late as 1960, four years before the artist's death, the exhibition also sets out to place the mural in the context of Davis's sustained artistic dialogue with New York City.",1986-01-31T05:00:00+0000
