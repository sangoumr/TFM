The author defines Louisiana cooking by lumping together Creole, or New Orleans style, and Cajun, country home style, because, he says, there is so little difference in what is served in restaurants today. He describes how he derives such a variety of tastes from so few seasonings: ''I often call for the same combinations of vegetables, such as onions, celery and bell peppers, or onions, celery, bell peppers and garlic. The secret of getting different tastes from these same combinations is in the amount of each you use.'' And he says, ''Something else I like to do with these particular vegetables is to add a portion of them in the early stages of cooking and then add the rest later; when you do this, you achieve levels of taste and texture.'' Mr. Prudhomme's recipes - the now famous blackened red fish and sweet potato pecan pie, or New Orleans Bread Pudding with its remarkable lemon sauce - lure cooks into the kitchen, even if it's too hot to cook.",1984-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Its title now shortened to ''Jane's Fighting Ships,'' the annual volume has become the leading reference book for people seeking to keep abreast of such strategic matters as the naval competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Other authoritative military annuals followed Jane's first volume. Since January, professionals and amateurs have not had to wait a year to find out what the world's military establishments are up to. Jane's Defence Weekly, published in London but circulated widely, has been among the first to report such things as Iraq's use of mustard gas against Iran and the Soviet bombardment of Afghan guerrillas with liquid firebombs.",1984-06-03T05:00:00+0000

On Tuesday, they will have a chance to show how succesful they have been, at least in helping to choose the Democratic nominee. The Democratic candidates have been devoting much of their attention to two populous industrial states, California and New Jersey, that hold primary elections Tuesday. Voters in West Virginia, New Mexico and South Dakota also go the polls. In California, where 306 seats at the Democratic Convention will be at stake day after tomorrow, it appears that the ''Hispanic vote'' - if in fact there is a homogeneous Hispanic vote - could be especially important. Hispanic registered voters in the state may exceed 1.2 million, or more than 10 percent of the total number of registered voters.

For centuries the soft, sturdy roots of the cottonwood trees provided raw material for local carvers. The Hopi and Navajo used the roots to make their kachina dolls, the small figures representing native American gods that were used for teaching religion. Learning from the Indians, the Spanish settlers worked the porous wood into santos - primitive religious images - for their homes and churches. Today's folk carvers still use cottonwood, but they no longer pick it from nearby river beds. The local supply has, not surprisingly, gotten pretty thin.

James W. Carey, the dean of the College of Communications at the University of Illinois, immediately went on the attack. Polls, he told the editors, are ''a dubious instrument through which to conduct our politics, our athletics or our moral life. I cannot imagine them an instrument for the evaluation or improvement of education.'' Polls are a staple of daily journalism, a source of information and analytical detail that newsgathering has embraced over the last 15 years. The attack by Dean Carey, who is a leading journalism educator, was typical of the tension that often characterizes relations between the people who practice journalism and the people who teach it. That tension is a key element in the new unrest over how journalism should be taught. In purely numerical terms, journalism education is a success. This academic year there were 75,000 undergraduate and graduate students in more than 80 programs, up from 15,000 two decades ago. The enrollment totals, however, can be misleading. Half the journalism students will go into public relations or advertising, and a quarter will drop out of communications work entirely. Of the students committed to journalism, there are substantial differences in needs and ambitions between those interested in broadcasting and those who want careers in print.",1984-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Having lived inside the fortress of a creed, they know where it is most vulnerable and can aim deadly blows at its softest spots.

George Rochberg is such a renegade, a composer who served his time as a respected soldier within the walls of Modernism but who deserted the citadel 20 years ago and has worked to undermine its dogmas ever since. His chief weapon in this effort has been his own purposely eclectic music, which sets out to make peace with the past and to contradict at every point the pseudoscientific systems on which most contemporary music is based. Not surprisingly, his later works have attracted automatic hostility from critics and fellow composers who set themselves up as defenders of the Modernist faith or one of its subcreeds, such as Serialism.",1984-06-03T05:00:00+0000

They will take you from the minute (snow flea) to the massif, packing - and backpacking - much flora and fauna, geologica and ecologica, in between. If you like your Nature dry but colorful, read the Sierra Club guide to the ''Desert Southwest.'' If you like it wooded and wildflowered, read ''The Field Guide to U.S. National Forests.'' If you like it vast but handy, read ''A Guide to Observing Insect Lives.'' And if you'd just like a fairly quirky, soul-stirring sermon on what really matters in your own small geological speck in time, read ''The Complete Walker III.'' The author of ''Walker,'' Colin Fletcher, states that ''The way to see important things (is) to walk.'' Each book describes important natural things. Now start walking. DUMMY HEADTHE COMPLETE WALKER III: The Joys and Techniques of Hiking and Backpacking. Even as the technology for packing your back gets lighter, Colin Fletcher's classic how-to-walk book gets more Falstaffian. ''This bloated third edition,'' Mr. Fletcher says, is a 75 percent ''old-new book,'' indeed a ''genuine, organic revision.'' He's ''restruggled'' to bring everything up to date - ''prices, practices, even prejudices.'' He's resucceeded. Mr. Fletcher, who in his no-tech soul maintains that walking is a ''simple, delightful, intended-to-be-liberating-from-the-straight-line-coordinates-of-civilizationpastime,'' finds himself in something of a peeve about ''the wilderness industry'' which has recently undergone both capitalism",1984-06-03T05:00:00+0000

TWO DESIGNERS ON THE MOVE","CLAUDE MONTANA BECAME A noteworthy Paris fashion force less than a decade ago. One of his first major collections - with Amazonian models in wide-shouldered, black-leather, ankle-length coats, their heads swathed in black leather helmets, moving to the sound of howling dogs and snapping chains - is still talked about. That collection defined the Montana woman: Valkyrie, not Earth Mother. There were always superb clothes in these collections, but they often were submerged by the show's theatrics. With his ready-to-wear collection for this fall, however, Montana stripped away much of the flamboyant showmanship, letting the good designs speak for themselves. The black-leather opening was gone. Instead, 15 models appeared in malachite and amethyst leathers, cashmeres, coats, jumpsuits, even a reversible satin trenchcoat in this sophisticated color mix. There was a new mood at Montana. From that sophisticated opening, he moved quickly into a luxurious sportswear group in butter-pecan whipcord, flannel and cashmere for ankle- length coats, oversize sweaters and pleated pants that flopped on the shoes. Then, that nonchalant glamour dissolved to a prim and proper nanny look in navy gabardine; staged a comeback in a group of jewel bright jackets and toppers, and took over the stage in the satin collared, paisley printed, long velvet evening coats, worn over silk men's-wear pajamas that have already inspired several American designers, whose fall collections offer variations of this theme. As with many young designers, Montana had trouble finding the right backers at first. Now, however, he says that that problem has been resolved.",1984-06-10T05:00:00+0000

Thousands of spectators and such officials as the United States Ambassador, Crown Prince Henri of Luxembourg, Luxembourg's Minister of Defense, the Mayor of Ettelbruck and high- ranking military officials of the two countries gather beneath weeping willows and among monuments for an occasion called Remembrance Day, originated by the citizens of Ettelbruck at the end of World War II.",1984-06-10T05:00:00+0000

By the 50's, readers' appetites - and writers' ambitions - had grown to Maileresque proportions. And in recent decades, the Great American Novel began to go to extremes.

This September, for example, Bergdorf Goodman will present the 32-year-old Paris designer's first major show in New York. Since l977, when he began designing on his own, Gaultier has demonstrated a talent for combining the classic and the eccentric in an amusing way. He also has been able to make new clothes look like old ones. ''I'm much more in tune with the London street scene than Paris,'' he says. ''Here the streets are no longer fashionable. In London, I always see a mix of the classic and the eccentric. I am much more inclined to eccentric. In Paris, French designers are concerned about 'chic.' They have the 1950's idea of 'chic is everything.' '' This is certainly the last thing Gaultier would ever be accused of. He is particularly fond of the current androgyny mood. For his fall show, he presented male and female models wearing variations of the same clothes. In fact, when he opens his own Paris boutique in January, he will mix men's and women's clothes together. ''I won't label them. I won't separate them,'' says Gaultier. ''Certainly, there are women who buy only men's shirts. There are men who may buy women's jackets because they like the fabric. There won't be any problem with sizes, because everything is already oversize.'' Not only is he an astute interpreter of the street scene, but, Gaultier says, ''I'm always studying people.",1984-06-10T05:00:00+0000

This monumental work, published in six parts between 1939 and 1954, is available for the first time in paperback and handily bound in two volumes. The Dublin-born playwright's re-creation of his long and combative life is one of the recognized masterpieces of our time. It was thus acknowledged even before Brooks Atkinson's rave review of the final volume, ''Sunset.'' Declaring that Sean O'Casey in his 70's was still ''thoroughly alive,'' The Times's veteran drama critic drew attention to the book's ''eloquence, passion, bitterness and force.'' O'Casey, who is best remembered for his antiheroic and antiwar plays of the 1920's (''Juno and the Paycock,'' ''The Silver Tassie''), was a militant patriot in private life, fiercely independent even as he was drawn to the utopian aspects of Communism in the 1930's. Unpopular with the Abbey Theater and eventually even with Yeats, he left Ireland in the early 30's for England, where he produced many more poignant and ironic plays while transcribing his life into this novel-like work.

In Princeton, on April 30, 1942, she signed the contract at Allen Tate's house where she, her husband Robert Lowell and I had stopped on our way to hear a lecture by Randall Jarrell. I was at the time an editor with Harcourt, Brace, and when Caroline Gordon (Mrs. Tate) learned that I had brought Jean's contract with me she made a ceremony of the signing with lighted candles on either side of the desk. A few weeks later I went into the Navy; the novel appeared in 1944 to an excellent press. Yet never in all the years of our friendship - I saw Jean at the hospital the day before her death in 1979 - did she even hint at something I've just discovered: She had written two novels prior to ''Boston Adventure.'' The first remained unfinished, because a publisher was afraid of a libel suit, and Jean abandoned it; she completed the second, for which she had a contract, and it was rejected. All this happened before her marriage to Lowell. It's perfectly understandable that Jean would not have talked about these early unsuccessful efforts while ''Boston Adventure'' was in the process of being published, but I'm surprised she never mentioned them later, since she enjoyed telling stories about her younger years.",1984-06-10T05:00:00+0000

us,LENDL WINNER OVER MCENROE,"Ivan Lendl won his first Grand Slam tennis tournament today, making a spectacular comeback in the French Open to defeat John McEnroe in a four-hour match that left 16,500 spectators dazzled and chanting the winner's name. The scores were 3-6, 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, 7-5. McEnroe raced to a two-set lead with his usual aggressive style, including a scorching serve, that seemed destined to turn the match into a rout. But when Lendl broke him in the sixth game of the third set, he also broke the tempestuous American's momentum. From there on, it was a sparkling, emotional endurance contest that seesawed until Lendl made the final break. McEnroe's last shot was a potentially easy volley that he tiredly knocked out of court. It seemed to symbolize the steady decay of his game. ''I saw hope as soon as I broke him,'' Lendl said of the crucial third set. ''I felt that once I could break him, I could do it again.'' A disconsolate McEnroe, who missed the chance to become the first American male to win here since 1955, said his game seemed to deteriorate as the match went on. He also said he had injured himself slightly when he fell in reaching for a shot. But he did not blame the injury for his defeat. ''I couldn't ask for any more chances,'' the 25-year-old left-hander said. It was his first loss of the year, after 42 victories. Lendl's remarkable victory complemented Martina Navratilova's singles triumph Saturday that completed her Slam - successive victories in the Wimbledon, United States, Australian and French championships. Today Miss Navratilova added another accomplishment by teaming with Pam Shriver to become the first women's doubles pair to win the Slam.",1984-06-11T05:00:00+0000

But people trust novels; you have only to mix a little public fact into your fiction and people will assume the worst - of your enemies. There is one problem; the public has to have heard of you first. The inside- great-events novel, as distinct from the older hidden- lives-of-celebrities novel, is a Media Age genre.

An uncommon reader herself, Virginia Woolf in this first collection of literary essays acknowledged ''the common reader'' (a term borrowed from Dr. Johnson), who ''reads for his own pleasure rather than to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of others.'' Some of these ''pleasures'' - like the Paston Letters, and the writings of the Duchess of Newcastle - may seem remote to the common reader of today. But Mrs. Woolf's most casual-seeming criticisms ''show an unwearying creativeness'' - as the unsigned review in our pages pointed out back in 1925, the year that also saw the publication of her first major novel, ''Mrs. Dalloway.'' Here we find her famous essay on ''Modern Fiction,'' exhorting novelists to convey ''the luminous halo'' and ''semi-transparent envelope'' surrounding reality. In writing about Jane Austen, the Bront""es or the Russian writers, Mrs. Woolf seems to apply her new prescription to criticism as well.

Then, as prices for air time soared, the 30-second ''spot'' became popular. Now, even as experts wonder if there might be a level of diminishing returns, 15-second commercials, known for the time being as ''split thirties,'' are being whizzed by viewers. Meanwhile, Madison Avenue has become almost spectacularly adept at cramming information into constantly shrinking spaces, and the television audience is being increasingly conditioned to the ''quick fix.''

The reasons reflect the wishes of his owners and race-track tradition. The two horses prominently buried in Belmont's infield are Ruffian and Timely Writer, crowd-pleasers who broke down on the track during races and had to be destroyed. Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif., is the final resting place of Lamb Chop and Quicken Tree. Lamb Chop was owned by William Haggin Perry, a co-owner of Swale, who wanted her to be buried at the site of her first stakes victory. Quicken Tree, who won the Jockey Club Gold Cup in 1968, had been the first California-bred to win that race, and his owners wanted him returned to his homeland. Pan Zareta, the great turn-of-the-century sprinting mare, and Black Gold, who became the only Louisiana Derby winner to win the Kentucky Derby, in 1924, are both buried at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. Native Diver, who won the Hollywood Gold Cup three consecutive times, from 1965 to 1967, is buried at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif., as is Landaluce, the great 2-year-old filly of 1982 whose 21-length victory in the Hollywood Lassie Stakes was the most lopsided stakes score in the track's history. Swale, Claiborne's first Kentucky Derby winner after 74 years of trying, was going to receive the traditional farm burial, which would have been the interment of only his head, heart, hooves and reproductive organs.",1984-06-23T05:00:00+0000

No one can condone the sexual abuse of children; it is a foul crime, in most times and places equated with sin. At the same time, crime or sin unexamined is crime or sin allowed to fester, perpetuated because there can be no remedial action. Television's dilemma, meanwhile, is that in trying to explain crime and sin, it may seem to be explaining them away. Without meaning to, television may sanction and legitimize, when supposedly it is trying only to warn. One problem with ''Something About Amelia,'' the ABC film about incest earlier this season, was that in its self-conscious urge to enlighten us, it removed moral opprobrium from the father who had committed the crime and made him the victim as much as his daughter. ''The Child Molesters,'' which examines a similar topic, and faces a similar problem, overcomes this. It also tells us a good deal about sexual aberrants.
