It sometimes seems that he labors for needs he himself understands better than he feels.

His point then was the benign paradox that the shrinking audience for fiction was really a good thing, because it left the novel only the best things: that exploration of the inner world's divisions and distinctions where no camera may follow, the fine, the difficult, the private.

us,Film: 'Pretty Baby' By Louis Malle,"IN a high panoramic shot we look over the roofs of a city at night. The opening title card tells us it's Storyville, New Orleans, 1917. From the far distance we hear a steam-boat's whistle, followed by a few notes on a blues trumpet. The mood is of impending loss, of the kind of bonedeep loneliness that is particular to the middle of the night.There's a sudden cut to the rapt face of a little girl. Just off-screen there are moans that could be either of pain or of ecstasy. Violet, the child, watches with both terror and excitement as her mother gives birth. The mother screams. The midwife gives reassuring instructions, and downstairs the nightly parties go on.The setting is Nell's place, one of the fancier brothels in the New Orleans tenderloin, and the bed might be the same one where Violet herself was born 12 years before, the daughter of Hattie, one of Nell's best ""girls,"" and of a father no longer known. Like her new half brother, Violet is what used to be called a ""trick baby.""In this fashion Louis Malle takes us inside the hermetic world of ""Pretty Baby,"" an almost incredibly romantic, autumnally beautiful movie that looks at life in a Storyville whorehouse with the unsurprised curiosity and boredom of a child who's never known anything else. Mr. Malle, the French director (""The Lovers,"" ""Murmur of the Heart"" and ""Lacombe, Lucien""), has made some controversial films in his time but none, I suspect, that is likely to upset convention quite as much as this oneand mostly for the wrong reasons.Though the setting is a whorehouse, and the lens through which we see everything is Violet, who, in the course of the film, herself becomes one of Nell's chief attractions, ""Pretty Baby"" is neither about child prostitution nor is it pornographic.The film, which opens today at the Coronet, is about the last days of Storyville, just before the New Orleans city fathers bowed to the reformers and closed down one of the most notorious redlight districts in the country. It is also a sad, essentially tender memoir about Violet's brief liaison and marriage with an obsessed photographer named Bellocq, a character basedbut very looselyon Ernest J. Bellocq, the physically misshapen, hydrocephallic photographer whose portraits of Storyville whores are now recognized as the work of a unique artist.Mr. Malle and Polly Platt, with whom he collaborated on the screenplay, have largely avoided judgmental attitudes by looking out at the world through Violet's eyes. They've also softened the contours of what was probably very sordid history by making a film of dazzling physical beauty. Sven Nykvist's camera is as obsessed as Bellocq's with texture, light, shade, line, expression.When one realizes that Keith Carradine's Bellocq is actually the center of the film, ""Pretty Baby"" becomes a parable about art and life, about the artist who makes the mistake of falling in love with his subject, a creature who is, in effect, his own creation. Mr. Carradine gives a haunting and haunted performance, as someone sentenced by his obsession always to be observer and interpreter, never a full participant.I've no idea whether or not Brooke Shields, the breathtakingly beautiful 12-year-old model who plays Violet, can act in any real sense, but Mr. Malle uses her brilliantly. As Gloria Swanson said of silent stars in ""Sunset Boulevard,"" ""We had faces then,"" and Miss Shields has a face that here transcends the need to act.She is, in quick succession, willful and funny, sly and stupid. At one minute she's a child with her first doll. Next she is grotesque in full makeup as she repeats by rote lines meant to excite a customer""Why, I can feel the steam inside me, right through my dress!""or pathetic as she excitedly awaits the outcome of a whorehouse auction, the highest bidder to win her favors.The consistent coolness of Mr. Malle's view prevents the movie from seeming to be exploitative. There is one key shot that, I think, defines this method, when, during the auction for Violet, the camera stays on the not quite impassive face of ""the Professor"" (Antonio Fargas), the black pianist who entertains Nell's drawing-room guests. As Mr. Fargas listens to the bids, we have, for just a fraction of a moment, a glimpse of what all this means in terms of life in the outside world, which is infinitely sad but far, far removed.Both Mr. Fargas and Susan Sarandon, who plays Violet's mother, give fully realized performances but Frances Faye, who plays old Nell, the madam, is so bad that you can't believe it's not intentional. Has her dialogue been postsynchronized? It has that disconnected sound. Miss Faye seems properly tough, but it's a toughness of another era. Toward the end of the film, too, the narrative continuity seems to go astray. Have key scenes been cut to assure the film's R-rating?These, though, are niggling questions to ask of something that is in every other way the most imaginative, most intelligent and most original film of the year to date.",1978-04-05T05:00:00+0000

But since last summer, when he first requested funds from Congress for its production, he has encouraged his Administration work toward getting other members of NATO to agree to its deployment as a deterrent against Soviet tanks.

us,Film: 'Calm Prevails':By VINCENT CANBY,"PETER LILIENTHAL'S ""Calm Prevails Over the Country"" is a German film made in Portugal about the gradual destruction of democracy in a South American country that resembles both Uruguay, where the German-born film maker lived for 20 years, and Chile. It's an intensely interesting film, very measured and clear at the beginning, full of the precisely observed details of daily life that in movies are the equivalent to life's small talk, and then, quite suddenly, a poetic parable of implications that extend beyond the political.The film will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 and repeated there next week Thursday through Sunday at the same time. Though ""Calm Prevails"" is not especially difficult, it makes no concessions to popular tastes and is thus a practically perfect presentation for the Film Forum, the most consistently successful showcase for offbeat films in New York.The film's central character is a remarkably resilient, intelligent old man, the owner of a small hotel in the capital city. This fellow, played with serene self-assurance by Charles Vanel, the veteran French actor who was 83 when the film was made three years ago, has lived long enough to have survived all sorts of political weather.At first he observes with passing interest the first signs of the state's suppression of the opposition. It doesn't immediately touch him. Then he's aware of the arrest of the children and grandchildren of friends. Finally his own grandchildren disappear.In the film's final sequence, there are no more able-bodied men left in the city. The old man makes some sandwiches, pays a young boy to take him to the city prison, where, after shouting a few vigorous denunciations of fascism to the guards, he enters the wails to rejoin his community.It should not spoil the film to be told its shape. In fact, I think it can increase one's appreciation for the manner in which the director works, beginning with the humdrum and escalating to moments that have the spirit of pure fantasy.Mr. Lilienthal's control of particular episodes sometimes is uncertain. An extended sequence about a jailbreak is total confusion in narrative terms. There's also a problem in that several of the younger men in the cast look so much alike that one can't always be sure who is supposed to be doing what or why.Mr. Vanel, though, is superb. It's very moving to see this fine old star, whom I first remember in Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear,"" lending the weight of his presence and his experience to such a venture.",1978-04-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Jane Since Tarzan:From Limb to Limbo,"A FAVORITE and rather tiresome assumption of a certain kind of sentimental comedy is that the only sane way to respond to the world is by being crazy. It is the small achievement of Walter Bockmayer and Rolf Buhrmann, who wrote and directed the new German film, ""Jane Is Jane Forever"" (Jane Bleibt Jane), that they can appreciate lunacy without mistaking it for a state of grace.""Jane Is Jane Forever"" is about a little old lady, Johanna (Johanna Konig), resident of a fairly luxurious home for the elderly, who firmly believes that she is Jane, the long-separated mate to Tarzan, who is pictured on her walls in the persons of Johnny Weissmuller, Gordon Scott and Lex Barker. Her deepest desire: to go back to Tarzan and to Africa, where, she knows, all her problems will vanish.The film, an entry in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, will be shown at the museum today at 11 P.M. and again Sunday at 8:30 P.M.Johanna is something of a burden to the other women at the home. She sets out to re-create the African jungle in her tiny room, filling it with plants, outlawed by the house rules, and taking as her companion a South American parrot named Loretta. One day she contemplates buying a python, but thinks better of it as she watches it digesting a small white mouse.The thing about Johanna that sets her apart is not her delusion but her awareness that it is a delusion, which is of no importance to her in view of the satisfactions of being crazy. Though Miss Konig, who really looks too young to be senile, has a tendency to play the character for charm, the movie itself is comparatively austere. It contemplates Johanna without tears as if accepting something as inevitable as death, the film's real subject.""Jane Is Jane Forever"" is a small, sharp movie, sometimes funny but more often decently understanding in the manner of someone who appreciates the privacy of another's terminal illness. Like the newspaper reporter (Peter Chatel) who befriends Johanna, and who accepts her fantasies without ridiculing her, the movie never patronizes its subject.",1978-04-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Quickie King And Man of Steel:Creators at Work,"""IN THIS FILM, we are combining the myth of Romeo and Juliet with high-speed car action and a plea for international weapons control in our time,"" says a young director, hard at work on a 10-day wonder for Roger Corman. Mr. Corman is the man whose New world Pictures gave work to directors like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola before anyone else would hire them; even now, after having distributed films by Ingmar Bergman and Franois Truffaut, he is still widely regarded as the king of the action quickie.""Roger Corman: Hollywood's Wild Angel"" chooses to examine Mr. Corman and his work obliquely, compiling laughably lurid film clips with brief revealing looks at some of Mr. Corman's protgs, who have been forced by New World's tight budgets and breakneck pacing to take a fairly cavalier attitude toward the esthetic possibilities of the cinema. As one of them puts it, ""The toughest thing about directing is getting up in the morning.""Although Mr. Corman is briefly interviewed here his employees' recollections of his advice are a good deal more telling than anything he says himself. Jonathan Demme, who made films like ""Caged Heat"" for New World before directing ""Handle With Care,"" explains that Mr. Corman likes to annotate each script he reads, scribbling things like ""breast nudity possible here?""Another Corman protg remembers a tidbit that proved invaluable: Try not to stand up when you don't have to, Mr. Corman told him. And don't stop to congratulate your crew after each shot is completed. If chewing the fat takes a minute each time, and you knock off 30 shots in a day, you can save yourself all of half an hour that way.Christian Blackwood, who directed this profile as part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Films/New Directors series, has assembled an amusing series of excerpts and trailers (""The Student Nursesenter their course!""). He has also lined up interviews with some of Mr. Corman's best-known and most personable protgs, among them Mr. Demme, Paul Barthel, Allan Arkush, Joe Dante, David Carradine, Ron Howard. Peter Fonda and Mr. Scorsese.Also on hand are a number of actors and actresses who aren't likely to work again anywhere, ever. Mr. Corman doesn't seem to care who his directors hire, as long as the performers can drive, scream, bleed, make horrible jokes and work for peanuts.In view of its subject, and of Mr. Corman's oft-repeated emphasis on speed and economy, Mr. Blackwood's generally frisky film goes slacker than it should at times. And it does seem a shame that after Mr. Blackwood cites Mr. Corman's prescient qualities and paints him as a man with his hand on the pulse of America's youth, the film never grills this entrepreneur about the current zeitgeist. A film about a man so clearly ahead of his time ought to explore his notion of the mood of the moment.The sculptor subject of ""Mark di Suvero: North Star,"" a film by Franois de Menil that shares the same bill, should have been a good match for Mr. Corman: Both men are playful, economical and quite purposeful about what they do. But Mr. di Suvero's work, huge metal sculptures, however eloquent they may seem when photographed from various angles and accompanied by Philip Glass's pulsating electronic score, loses something in scope and grandeur when captured on the screen. And Mr. di Suvero's observations about his work tend to undermine rather than amplify.Mr. di Suvero is clearly a man of enormous charm and vitality, but his conversation is every bit as vague as his work is streamlined. And Mr. de Menil's direction takes the sculptor's fuzziest observations at face value. ""The artist has to reject whatever society is doing around him in order to become an artist,"" Mr. di Suvero says. And: ""The United States is guilty of something like Chile#8212;that's incredible.""""Do any of your sculptures make a political statement?"" Mr. di Suvero is asked. He cites one called ""Mother Peace,"" explaining that ""if you really look carefully at it, it works in many different ways."" Later, the art critic Barbara Rose asks, in an insinuatingly intimate, Rona Barrett-like tone, whether Mr. di Suvero is afraid he's crazy. ""C'mon, I'm afraid I'm too sane,"" is his predictable reply.Mr. di Suvero's works are seen in many different settings, from bleak, industrial-looking cities to the Tuileries. However, the question of what relationship a large, outdoor work of art ought to have to setting is sniffed at rather than addressed. A few French people are shown to have mixed opinions about a huge sculpture in a public garden, and one American art commissioner sadly but smugly notes the general public's inability to understand contemporary avant-garde art.Footage of the 1975 opening of the Whitney Museum's di Suvero retrospective is much more revealing of what art loses in translation on its way to an audience, as well-dressed first-nighters view the show with an elitism fiercely incompatible with the work and all it stands for. The film's most piquant moment shows a woman reclining playfully on one of Mr. di Suvero's mobile pieces, drawling that it might be fun to have something just like this at the summer place in the Hamptons.",1978-04-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Homage to Garcia Lorca:In Museum Series,"""TO AN UNKNOWN GOD"" (""A un Dios Desconocido""), the second feature film by Jaime Chavarri, the Spanish director, is a handsome, densely packed, evocative movie that makes a lot of rather stern demands upon anyone who sees it. It's the sort of thing one should prepare for, like an uncut ""Hamlet,"" a full-length ""Die Meistersinger"" or a ""Blood Wedding"" in Spanish.The film, which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 8:30 P.M. and on Monday at 6 P.M., is one of three that today begins the annual New Directors/New Films series at the museum. The series is jointly presented by the museum's department of film and the Lincoln Center Film Society.Like the recent films of Carlos Saura and Victor Erice, ""To an Unknown God"" recalls the legacy of nearly 40 years of the Franco dictatorship but it does this in terms that are so special, so private, that one attends the film as if it were a meeting of cabalists. The movie is full of secret signs and mysterious associations. Over it all hangs the ghost of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Spanish poet and playwright who was murdered in 1936 by the Falangists who despised his homosexuality as much as his left-wing politics.Though most of the film is the contemporary memoir of a middle-aged, homosexual magician named Jos (Hector Alterio), the film opens in Granada in 1936 when Jos as a small boy, was seduced by an older boy who was living in the elegant old house where Garcia Lorca's murder, this opening sec-unfamiliar with the circumstances of Garcia Lorca's murder, this opening section makes no sense whatsoever. As it is, one never is exactly sure who Jos's young male lover is, or what his connection is to the famous guest, who is seen once in a long, shot, much as Christ is sometimes glimpsed in Biblical epics.Jos appears to be a successful magician, at least in bookings, but his life is fastidiously lonely. Though his somewhat younger lover, Miguel (Javier Elorriaga), a worker on behalf of radical causes, is open-hearted and generous, Jos devotes himself to the memory of his lost youth. At one point he returns to Granada for a reconciliation with a woman who, like Jos is obsessed by the memory of Garcia Lorca as well as by the memory of the boy, now dead, whom they both loved.For some peculiar reason, English subtitles, which adequately translate most of the film's Spanish dialogue, are denied us in two key sequences in which Jos as he's going to bed, plays a tape containing (I think) Jos himself speaking Garcia Lorca's poetry. Perhaps Mr. Chavarri thinks it would be sacrilege to translate the poet's lines as mere subtitles. In any case we are denied key information and must make out as best we can by recognizing, on the tape, references to ""Valt Vitmann"" and the Spanish words meaning ""sleep,"" ""dream"" and ""death.""Because of its Spanish origin, ""To an Unknown God"" has astonished a number of European critics for its frank, unhysterical treatment of homosexuality, but the truth is that Mr. Chavarri's particular preoccupations result in a movie that seems as self-interested, even arrogant, as poor, lonely Jos. ""To an Unknown God"" is lovely to look at, highly cultivated and poised, and very, very difficult to get to know.",1978-04-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Series: 'The Baker's Bread':West German Picture Shown At Museum of Modern Art,"""The Baker's Bread"" is as small-scale and modest as the West German village in which its story takes place. At the film's beginning, a young man arrives in town to begin his apprenticeship with a local baker, whose durable, family-run business is being threatened by the prosperity of a nearby supermarket and the prospect of a new shopping center. From then on, we watch the baker and his assistants worry about automation and begin to question the economic system that has made their kind of craftsmanship obsolete. We also watch the young newcomer evolve into a family member of sorts, and then become the gruff, blustery, lovable boss's right-hand man.Erwin Keusch, whose low-keyed but often compelling film is being shown as part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Films/New Directors series, occasionally jeopardizes the engaging plainness of his story to bring one character or another to the figurative podium, so that the obligatory speeches about the evils of modernization can he made. But for the most part the film proceeds as swiftly as a day in the bakery might go. Mr. Keusch's gift for being most communicative when his film seems to be saying the least is nothing to sneeze at, and his work is effective in eccentric, nicely unexpected ways.Mr. Keusch is the son of a baker; if you didn't know that before seeing his film, you would surely surmise it from the loving attentiveness with which he sketches bakery life. This is an absolutely spellbinding movie for anyone who likes watching dough rise, and even those who prefer to be on the eating end of the baking process may enjoy learning a thing or two. Werner (Bernd Tauber) the assistant, graduates during the course of the movie from simple kneading and sifting to inventing his own recipes. The camera doesn't dwell unnecessarily on his handiwork, but it follows his progress closely, as he takes ever-increasing pride in his work.Another baker, Kurt (Manfred Siepold), is meanwhile seen in the background, knotting pretzels in a split-second and performing other similarly magical feats. Mr. Siepold is a handsome fellow and a good actor, but if he doesn't actually bake for a living, it's a shame.When he isn't working or dragging himself out of bed hours before dawn, young Werner is pitching woo, but this aspect of his hero's life leaves Mr. Keusch strangely ill-at-ease. One affair, with a rich girl Werner meets when he delivers her birthday cake, seems present in the film solely to make a point about the class system, and the portion of the story that involves her has the feeling of an unexpected and unwelcome lecture. When Werner falls in love for real, the baking and spooning episodes are so clumsily integrated that the romance once again seems tacked-on.In another episode, a most disturbing one, Werner is pounced upon by a very attractive older woman who works in the shop. After they spend one night together, he becomes unaccountably hurtful and rude; she, even more unaccountably, decides life without Werner just isn't worth living. At times like this, Mr. Keusch's presentation of his young hero as a man of few words becomes problematic, and his trick of cutting away from tender moments almost before they happen makes his story hard to follow.""The Baker's Bread"" is being billed as a West German comedy, but viewers expecting belly laughs would be well advised to try to recall the last West German film they deemed even remotely amusing. In this case, let's just say that nobody dies, all ends reasonably well andhere's the funny partthe bakery crew one day confounds the manager of the supermarket by buying up all his breakfast rolls.",1978-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Redemption and Resurrection Are Themes of 'Barocco' Film,"Behind the opening credits of ""Barocco,"" Andr Tchin's second feature to be shown in New York (his first was ""French Provincial""), we see a series of distorted close-ups of such exotic fauna as crocodiles, giant snakes and horned lizards so ancient they might have witnessed creationimages designed to make the flesh crawl with primal fears.It's something of a disappointment, then, that when the film begins, we are in a neon-bright, busy, commercial European city. It's actually Amsterdam, though the film never specifically says so, which is one of the smaller affectations of this would-be thriller that cares less about the fundamental mechanics of murder, blackmail and physical intimidation than it does about such weighty subjects as redemption and resurrection.""Barocco"" will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 11 in the annual New Directors/New Films series, and again tomorrow evening at 6.Mr. Tchin, who was born in 1943, belongs to a second generation of French film critics associated with Cahiers du Cinema who followed Franois Truffaut, Claude Chabrol and others from criticism into film-making. On the basis of both ""French Provincial,"" which was about nothing less than the rise and fall of the French bourgeoisie, and now ""Barocco,"" Mr. Tchin remains more of a theorist than an artist.His films have a way of starting off very well and then slowly congealing into stiff, intellectualized attitudes that have less to do with art than with its interpretation. Only Mr. Chabrol, at the top of his form, and Wim Wenders, in his recent ""The American Friend,"" successfully manage to fuse the two disciplines.""Barocco"" means to be baroque, but it's about as baroque as a pedant's laundry list. It's a schematic tale of murder and blackmail during a municipal election. Its focal point is a nice dumb-lug of a boxer, played by Grard Dpardieu, who is paid a handsome fee to say he had a homosexual affair with one of the candidates, and the boxer's girl, played by Isabelle Adjani, who originally persuaded the boxer to take the bribe so that they could flee to more exotic climates.Something goes wrong, however, and the boxer is murdered and Miss Adjani finds herself falling in love with the hood who murdered her lover. This is easy to understand. The hood is also played by Mr. Dpardieu, though ""Barocco"" would have us believe that the girl's love redeems the murderer and, in effect, resurrects him. Nonsense. The miracle is in the casting.""Barocco"" is a very classy looking movie, with lots of fancy camerawork in lots of fancy, ultramodern settings. In addition to Mr. Dpardieu and Miss Adjani, the cast includes such superior performers as Marie-France Pisier, who has some funny moments as a hooker, Jean-Claude Briarly, and Claude Brasseur. They are most attractive, lively people, but their material is dead.",1978-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Mother and Daughter,' Film of Elegant Conflict","As ""Mother and Daughter"" begins, a wealthy Italian family is seen eating breakfast in an outdoor setting, smoothing exquisite-looking honey over perfect toast. The villa is spectacular, and the sunlight is dazzling; the maid tending to everyone's tiniest need is young and pretty, and she seems to enjoy being a maid. In the garden, flowers bloom and birds chirp, and at table, father complains jovially that mother never remembers to serve grapes. Just then, the teen-age son reaches over and plucks a bunch of grapes out of a bowl, tossing them playfully at his sister. So there isn't any trouble in paradise, after all.""Hah!"" director Giovanna Gagliardo means to say. All this wonderfulness is merely a sham. The beautiful mother (Carla Gravina), who wears pearls to chop carrots in her elegant kitchen, has absolutely nothing of consequence to do, so she pads about the palazzo in a near-stupor, occasionally stopping to prepare an elaborate meal.Though the mother expresses little, she is actually engaged in an age-old struggle with her young daughter, whom the mother would like to keep dependent forever. We know this because the daughter is symbolically crippled, walking gingerly with a cane that has a silver handle.The film, which is part of the New Directors-New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art, more or less takes place on one day. But the daughter is sometimes crippled and sometimes not, sometimes an adolescent and sometimes a child; figments of the mother's memory or imagination wander in at will.""Mother and Daughter"" never lets a scene go by quietly when an intrusive blast of directorial technique will do, and so it becomes impossible for the viewer to care a fig about either the sleepwalking mother or her half-imaginary child. Miss Gagliardo's insights into the mother-daughter struggle are so slight, and her direction so over-bearing, that the results suggest what might happen if an infantry unit were called in to kill a bat.As a director, Miss Gagliardo is distressingly insensitive to the relationship between style and purpose. As an interior director, however, she is formidable.

us,Joan Rivers 'Rabbit Test' Film Depicts First Pregnant Man,"As Woody Allen's career demonstrates, there's no good reason why a stand-up comic with a nervous, staccato delivery can't adapt that style to fit the demands of a feature-length film, provided that the comedy stems from a consistent, genuinely funny point of view. Joan Rivers's nightclub routines abound with the same kind of self-deprecation and misanthropy in which Mr. Allen used to specialize, and her premise for ""Rabbit Test""what would happen if a man became pregnant?sounds like it might be good for an hour-and-a-half's worth of bunny fluff.But like entirely too many comics before her, Miss Rivers has turned to directing without paying much heed to whether a whole movie constructed from one-liners is worth even the sum of its parts. In her case, it's notand the one-liners weren't all that sparkling to begin with.When it winds up on television, which is where a movie this visually crude belonged in the first place, ""Rabbit Test"" may improve slightly: Constant commercial interruptions may help distract attention from the movie's continuity problems, which are severe. And the coarseness of its comedy may not seem so insufferable to an audience willing to sit still for ""Laverne and Shirley.""Miss Rivers's jokes mostly have to do with racial stereotypes and the essential revoltingness of pregnancy, but a few of them are funny just the same. However, as a director, Miss Rivers is forever sandbagging her own scenes, throwing away a good chuckle in a sequence that desperately needs a punch line, or wasting something fairly subtle right after a broad, dopey joke about a urine sample. Whenever one does laugh, it's in spite of the movie, rather than because of it.At mechanically regular intervals, a variety of veteran performers wander by for wasted cameosthe cast includes George Gobel, Imogene Coca, Richard Deacon, Paul Lynde, Sheree North, Tom Poston and a lot of other players who are almost always funnier than they are here. Too many of them mimic Miss Rivers's breathless delivery, and in some caseslike Alex Rocco'sthe dialogue is so speedy it becomes almost inaudible.As for the world's first pregnant man, played by Billy Crystal, his predicament turns out to be a lot less curious than it sounds. Miss Rivers makes almost nothing of the role-reversal possibilities her premise suggests, and Mr. Crystal manages to convey neither astonishment nor acceptance of the impossible. He just becomes pregnant and has a baby, and that's the end of that. It's a lot easier to entertain the notion of a pregnant man than it is to understand why anyone would choose to end an alleged comedy with such a lead balloon.""Rabbit Test,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a number of bathroom jokes, mostly of an infantile nature.",1978-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,'Running Fence' Films Story of an Art Event:The Program,"As befits a documentary about a work of conceptual art, ""Running Fence"" has as much to do with the reception that greeted Christo's construction of a 22-mile fence as it does with the fence itself. Early footage of community meetings in northern California's Marin and Sonoma Counties where the fence was temporarily erected, indicates opinion in the area was sharply divided, and tempers ran high.One woman feared that allowing Christo to build the fencewhich he planned to remove two weeks laterwould open the region up to ""carnivals, rock concerts, motorcycle races, whatever."" One man was heard to mutter, ""I bet he can't even paint a picturehe's an idiot.""A friendly looking older woman compared the project to a well-cooked meal: ""Sometimes I go to a lot of work to prepare a masterpiece, and what happens? It gets eaten up."" Later, in a local cafe, one waitress explained that the completed fence wasn't ""pretty in the sense of pretty, but it looks different, and it's kinda nifty.""Directed by Albert Maysles, David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, the film records the most intriguing reaction of all, that of a herd of sheep seen running beside the fence on a silent, misty morning. The sheep dash towards the barrier so impetuously that they seem about to collide with it; watching them, one can't help wondering what they make of this unexpected obstruction on familiar terrain.The fence is extravagantly lovely, standing 18 feet high and made of a gleaming white fabric that ripples in the wind, but do sheep really care about such considerations? Who can say? In any case, these particular sheep finally find the opening that has been left for them and blithely pass through, as a rancher looks on with a wonderfully knowing expression.There is a great deal of shouting and arguing in ""Running Fence,"" but the hubbub is punctuated by wordless interludes like this one, brief sequences that suggest both the large issues and the tiny ones suggested by Christo's undertaking. Very deliberately, the film never explains either Christo or his intentions. But it demonstrates, wordlessly and at times almost magically, that what he hoped to accomplish was very like what he attained.Christo's Running Fence project, shown here in its planning, construction and completed stages, is about as ideal a subject as any documentary film maker could hope to find.Every participant in the process seems keenly aware of and vastly amused by his or her own role, and the camera becomes a welcome, openly acknowledged witness. The particular artfulness of the Haysles brothers and Miss Zwerin lies in their having taken the film beyond the golden opportunity Christo and his fence provided, and into the realm of keen, unerringly even-handed acuity. ""Running Fence"" presents its material clearly and impartially, yet it establishes and sustains a distinct point of view. The directors' influence is palpable, yet never meddlesome.""Running Fence,"" which is being shown at the Whitney Museum, is 58 minutes longan ideal length, but a commercially unwieldy one, unless the film later turns up on television or on a double bill. In any case, for all the books and posters Christo's exhilarating and audacious project will spawn, this is the next best thing to having been there.",1978-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Turks in Sweden:Stockholm Saga,"""THE BUS,"" a Turkish-Swiss coproduction filmed mostly in Sweden, is as sincere as a public-service ad on behalf of clean air but somewhat less engrossing. The film, which was written, directed and produced by Bay Okan, a leading Turkish actor who also stars in it, will be shown in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P.M. and again on Friday at 9:30 P.M.""The Bus"" is about a group of Turkish workers who are swindled by a compatriot who smuggles them into Sweden, takes their money and then leaves them sitting in their bus in the middle of Stockholm.For three days they remain in the bus, the curtains drawn, suspecting the worst. At night they sneak out to go to a nearby lavatory, forage for food and explore the cruel city.One fellow is picked up by a homosexual and goes mad, as if that were the natural order of events. All are hungry and not one of them is more articulate than a Labrador retriever. Though it's a sad story, Mr. Okan never makes it seem especially moving, maybe because his pretentions as a film artist get in his way.He has a fondness for starting scenes by having the image swim into focus, as if someone were awakening with a hangover. The camera is fascinated by the usual oddities and ugliness of urban living and by horizontal panshots, which make you feel as if your eyeballs had come loose. Mr. Okan himself plays the immigrant worker who goes to spectacular pieces. The only other easily indentifiable role, that of the swindling bus driver, a fellow who in turn is swindled himself, played by Ogur Arlas. The performances are not great.The film is meant, I suspect, to ???are so dense, so naive and so faceless???tion of the innocent, but the workers are so dense, so naive and so faceless that it seems more to be an indictment of native ignorance.",1978-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Sons and Fathers,"How silent men are about their fear of other men! How strangely silent they are about their fathers! Talking tc most men today about their fathers Is like asking Telemachus about his father, Odysseus (who abandoned him for 20 years of Homeric adventure), like asking a son about an absent and overwhelming and overromanticized figure. Too many sons actually believe Freud's Oedipal formulation, believe that they wished to kill their own fathersnever the opposite. If you ask a man about his childhood, he often says: Oh, you want me to tell you about my mother! When men talk about their fathers in public, it is usually to praise them. Sons, like daughters, have lower emotional expectations of fathers than of mothers. Children often remember liking fathers more, unconsciously excusing their absences, their emotional distance, or their physical violence and being automatically grateful for the slightest paternal approval or attention. Very few sons remember being fondled, held or kissed by fathers on daily basis. Fewer admit of being humiliated, belittled or rejected. We are unused to attributing responsibility to men for how children grow up. Our outrage is reserved for the facts of maternal child abuse. We find it easier to deny, explain away, or at least understand paternal child abuse, or emotional and physical abandonment. As I looked for the positive aspects of the fatherson relationship, I discovered the same tragedy of lost opportunity that characterizes most motherdaughter relationships. How sad that men base an entire civilization on the principle of male legal ownership of children, and then never really get to know their sons or daughters well and never participate, for whatever reason, in daily, intimate fathering. protectionenough to give up their mothers. To please fathers, sons obey the incest taboo; sons dissociate themselves from maternal traits; sons deny their shameful dependency on maternal nurturance. Sons rebel against motherrule and submit, mindlessly, to fatherrule. More, they blame mothers for whatever guilt or anguish they feel about this. I began to perceive the many displacements of sons wounded by fathers: away from stronger men, away from envied and feared men, away from fathers, and onto weaker men, children and women. Men name mothers and other women when they talk about feeling castrated. It is women, men tell us, who are bitchy, belittling, dangerous and demanding. Not other men. Never their fathers.",1978-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Reinhard Hauff, the director, in other words, seems to have scoured West Germany for unlovely settings, not picturesque villages and valleys or bright and bustling towns. The country is flat, the people coarse, the color photography dim. In short, we are mired in the ""realism"" into which young film makers are apt to stumble while seeking a shortcut to Parnassus. Or in this instance to the Museum of Modern Art, where the two films will be shown at 6 P.M. today and at 8:30 P.M. tomorrow as part of the New Directors/New Films series.The climax of ""Paule Paulander"" occurs when an outbreak of swine fevernot to be confused with swine fluruins the father and brings on an emotional breakdown. The youth knocks away the rifle that his father is threatening him with and clubs him briskly with a shovel. Leaving the stubborn old fellow moaning on a pile of dying piglets, he abandons the acres that his family has tilled for 300 years to seek his fortunes in the big city.In ""The Main Actor"" the youth is recruited to play the starring role in a film within a film, an unsparing quasi-documentary look into the horrors of rural life, as seen from the perspective of the film's director, who seems to be a socialist of some sort and it is hinted, a homosexual.Tired of dismantling old Volkswagens, encouraged by his father's kicks and cuffs, this youth abandons the junkyard. He follows the director to what may be the same city, possibly Cologne, where he turns out to be no happier.Mr. Hauff has made the mistake of stating his intentions in a credo distributed at the screening of the films instead of fulfilling them on the screen. For artistic ideological reasons that he fails to make entirely clear in the statement, he has amateur actors in ""Paule Paulander"" and professionals in ""The Main Actor."" Both perform at about the same level of plodding inadequacy, with the edge, perhaps, going to the amateurs.",1978-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Witty 'Joseph Andrews':Misadventures Galore,"HAVING had such a smashing financial and critical success with his screen version of Henry Fielding's ""Tom Jones."" Tony Richardson was, one suspects, a bit reluctant to make a film based on ""Joseph Andrews,"" Fielding's second greatest novel, a work that originated as Fielding's answer to what he saw as the hypocritical pieties of Samuel Richardson's ""Pamela.""In the mid-18th century, ""Pamela"" enjoyed the kind of success that today is had only by the work of Victoria Holt and those other Gothic novelists who continue to sell the idea that virtue is its own reward, often accompanied by a large fortune.In ""Pamela,"" which was published in 1740, Richardson told the inspiring tale of Pamela Andrews, a serving girl who tenaciously held onto her virginity until her employer, the rich Mr. Booby, came across with a marriage license. Several years later, Mr. Fielding turned this story wildly upside down in a novel about Pamela's brother, Joseph, a serving boy who is as innocent as his sister but not nearly as calculating, who must fight off all sorts of lewd advances and whose triumph is one of true virtue rather than greed.Not wanting to appear to be repeating himself, Mr. Richardson waited nearly 15 years before turning to ""Joseph Andrews."" The funny, stylish, infinitely cheerful film, which opens today at the Festival and other theaters, is well worth the wait. ""Joseph Andrews"" is not a sequel to ""Tom Jones"" in any literal sense, though it shares with that earlier movie its 18th-century period and its exuberant high spirits.In addition ""Joseph Andrews"" contains more great (and more greatly funny) character performances than any film I've seen in years. It's one of the few movies around now that truly lifts the spirits, not only because it is so good-humored but also because the humor is laced with so much wit and wisdom.Peter Firth, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in ""Equus,"" is marvelously earnest and innocent in the title role. He is the calm eye that is the center of a hurricane of extraordinary characters who tumble around him in all sorts of adventures involving mistaken identities, coincidental meetings on country lanes, stolen babies, lust, true love, gypsies, highwaymen, evil squires, urban corruption and rural pleasures.Foremost in this cast of characters is the single-mindedly lecherous Lady Booby, Joseph's employer, played by Ann-Margret at the top of her magnificent form, a lady who goes after the unsuspecting Joseph with something of the purpose of a warped missionary. She looks great and she is enchantingly funny, but so is almost everyone else in a cast so big I really don't know where to begin, since I'm sure to leave out someone important. It's one of those films in which even the smaller roles are as beautifully and as memorably done as the larger ones.There is, for example, John Gielgud's brief and hilarious appearance as the doctor who is called in at one point to minister to Joseph's wounds but who examines, instead, a corpse, taking some while to realize that the patient is, in fact, ""no more."" There are also Beryl Reid as Mrs. Slipslop, Lady Booby's servant, a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver attempting to be dainty; the incomparable Michael Hordern as Parson Adams, the well-meaning clergyman who defends Joseph at all costs; Natalie Ogle, as Fanny, Joseph's virginal true love, and Karen Dotrice, who is most comic as the prissy and successful Pamela Andrews.There is in the entire film just one shot that I wish someone had cut out, but I won't describe it since it may go unnoticed by others. The film is otherwise an almost perfect blending of beauty, romance and adventure, of landscapes too lovely to believe alternating with the kind of gritty period detail that prompts one character to say of a street jam in the resort city of Batti, ""The only things that move here are the bowels of the horses.""Mr. Richardson, as the director, and Allan Scott and Chris Bryant, who wrote the screenplay, based on Mr. Richardson's screen story, have captured the particular, very special charm of Mr. Fielding's narrative style, which never holds onto one adventure for a second too long. Thus Joseph's escapades open, one out of the other, with the effortlessness of a dream. Even the flashbacks, which we see through what seems to be a fish-eye lens, move the narrative forward at a breakneck pace that never falters.The movie year, which has not been great so far, looks a great deal richer today.",1978-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Rare Chaplin, 'A Woman of Paris':A Gilded Cage","MARIE ST. CLAIR, the heroine of Charles Chaplin's radiantly beautiful ""A Woman of Paris,"" is, at the film's beginning, locked inside her bedroom by her foul-tempered father. That same evening, after she has escaped by climbing out a window, her father reverses the trick and locks her out. A year later, fate has whisked Marie away from her simple country home and off to ""the magic city of Paris, where fortune is fickle and a woman gambles with life."" There, she is imprisoned, once again, but this time the cage is gilded and then some: Marie has become the expensively kept mistress of a very rich, very dapper, eternally bemused man. Almost obscenely wealthy by now, Marie isn't always happy, but she wasn't always happy as a simple country girl, either. Fate, as Mr. Chaplin understands it, works in endlessly ironic and enormously touching ways.The wisdom of ""A Woman of Paris,"" which was first released in 1923 but often feels as if it were made just yesterday, really does seem boundless; so do the affection and generosity with which Mr. Chaplin presents his characters. The film, described by an introductory note from Mr. Chaplin as ""the first serious drama written and directed by myself,"" has nothing of the Little Tramp about it, although the director does appear in a tiny cameo role as a railway porter. Consequently, it was a commercial failure in its day. After that, it stayed out of circulation for more than 50 years, until Mr. Chaplin prepared a new score and allowed the film to be screened at the Museum of Modern Art two years ago. Since then, the film has had the reputation of a lost masterpiece, and it more than lives up to its renown.The tale of a pampered woman who learns the hard way to value simplicity and honesty may not seem like big news, but Mr. Chaplin used that premise to string together an uninterrupted series of perfect vignettes. One of the best of these involves Marie (Edna Purviance), her lover Pierre Revel (Adolphe Menjou) and some pearls he long ago bestowed upon his mistress. Marie defiantly tells Pierre that she is leaving him to marry her provincial sweetheart, because all she really wants from life are a few children and the love of a good man. To prove her point, she rips off the necklace and flings it out a window. But when she looks out to find a hobo discovering the jewels, she races into the street and grabs them back. She is followed by a little dog, which appears just long enough to suggest a certain side of Marie's nature and is never seen again.Although ""A Woman of Paris,"" which opens today at the Cinema Studio, is a drama in many respects, it is at times extremely funny; Mr. Chaplin gets some wonderfully witty milage out of the incongruity of upper-class pretensions and the bestial side of anyone's nature. The film's most dazzling sustained sequence takes place in a posh restaurant, where Marie and Pierre dine elegantly on champagne and truffles. As a title explains, ""Note: truffles rooted up from the soil by hogsa delicacy for pigs and gentlemen."" The moment is wry, but not satirical, thanks both to Mr. Chaplin's complex sympathies and the enormously alluring performances of Miss Purviance and Mr. Menjou, Mr. Chaplin never forgets that the most effective way of sending up a life of ease involves exaggerating, not deflating, its sense of easiness.The stirring tableau that ends the film's Parisian segment ideally exemplifies Mr. Chaplin's care, compassion and economy. Marie, having re-encountered her country lover after she began putting on airs, commissioned him to paint her portrait in an elegant white gown. Instead, he chose to depict her in a simple, dark dress he remembered her wearing before.Long after the portrait is completed, Marie happens to be wearing the white outfit on a night that ends in tragedy, and destiny leads her to a spot directly beneath the dark portrait, where she weeps so honestly that an enemy is moved to spare her life. Nothing could be less melodramatic than the manner in which Mr. Chaplin presents this small epiphany. And nothing could be more rich with the eternal promise of redemption.",1978-04-14T05:00:00+0000

The fellow, who's named ???Morlar and is played gloomily by Richard Burton, possesses telekinetic powers to make those of the characters in ""The Fury"" look frail indeed. On the merest whim he can??? by simply willing it, cause a 747 to crash, ruin a m???oon-landing and shake a thousand-year-old Gothic cathedral to its corner???.The movie was directed by Jack Gold from a screenplay by John Briley and it's fuzzy on a number of key issues that possibly could have made it fun, had they been sharper. Morlar is neither an evil character nor is he pathetic in the manner of someone who has a terminal illness. We see him as if he had some sort of antisocial disease, which, coupled with his bad temper, makes him unpleasant to have around.Lino Ventura, the veteran French stars plays the detective called in to investigate a near-fatal attack on Morlar, and Lee Remick plays the psychiatrist who relates much of Morlar's life, which we see in flashbacks.Mr. Gold, who directed ""The Bofors Gun"" some years ago, displays a gift for comedy in some of the sequences, especially when we see how Morlar, as a 10-year-old, got rid of his mum and dad while picnicking on the white cliffs of Dover, but there's not a single really scary shock-effect in the entire film. Among the good actors who assist Mr. Burton, Mr. Ventura and Miss Remick, are Harry Andrews, Michael Hordern and Marie-Christine Barrault (""Cousin, Cousine""). A job is a job.""The Medusa Touch,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some vulgar language and, at the end, a not-very-convincing disaster.",1978-04-14T05:00:00+0000

The wonder is not that distortions occur in the writing of such art history, but that anything remotely resembling a coherent and persuasive chronicle ever sees the light of day. Everybody knows that a friendship or a love affair or a divorce, a move to the country or a decision not to, an altercation with a dealer or an affront to a critic or curator, can sometimes determine an artist's place in written history; yet, the history is written as if it were a completely objective account of objects and their attributes.

They are deterred by societal ethics that warn against involvement in another man's affairs, andhalted by their own uncertainty as to what does or does not constitute abuse. Factors twist together like the fibers of a rope and keep the helping adult from the hurting child. As a result, less than a third of the estimated one million American children abused each year ever reach the attention of childprotective agencies. If a greater amount of violent mistreatment is to be prevented, more must be understood about the dynamics of intervening, about why people don't come to the aid of such children.",1978-04-16T05:00:00+0000

The grand jury apparently believed they were not indicting a dead man, said District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, although he declined to provide any evidence to the contrary. According to the indictments Mr. Graiver and four other bank officials siphoned off funds from American Bank and Trust to a Belgian bank owned by the Graiver family and then to companies  some of them dummies  also owned by the family. The Belgian bank has since collapsed. The Argentine Government earlier had charged that Mr. Graiver was a financial adviser for the Montoneros, a leftist terrorist group, and they have suggested that Montonero money was used by Mr. Graiver to seek control of American Bank and Trust. Eight relatives and former employees of Mr. Graiver were sentenced to long jail terms in Argentina for allegedly helping the guerrillas. The Graivers are Jewish and their prosecution raised charges of antiSemitism on the part of the ultraconservative Argentine military Government. Mr. Morgenthau said the aid of Interpol, the international police organization, would be invoked in the search for Mr. Graiver; meanwhile, the Manhattan grand jury that indicted him has been extended through 1979; it is expected to investigate the possibility of other crimes, on the theory that if Mr. Graiver is indeed still alive, the pilots who died in the plane crash have been murdered.",1978-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Far Road,' Japan Film, At Museum","THE style and subject of ""The Far Road,"" a Japanese entry in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, are nicely consonant. The film's story, which spans 30 years and follows the life of a railroad worker and his family, is of course deeply concerned with the effects of modernization upon postwar Japan.Accordingly, the film's direction incorporates standard elements of both Japanese and Western film technique. ""The Far Road"" is the first feature film directed by Sachiko Hidari, who also plays the railway worker's wife, and it is often quite successful in mingling incompatible scenes and ingredients without generating a sense of clashing moods.For instance, an opening episode shows the railway worker (Ichizo Takinogami) and his wife traveling by train to attend a ceremony, during which the worker will be awarded a medal for his many years of service. His wife, donning a kimono for the first time in ages, is nervous and shy, and the other wives in the audience look similarly ill at ease. Meanwhile, the few young children in the crowd wear Western clothes and squirm with boredom. These different generations seem every bit as bewildered as they are divided.After the ceremony, the whole family is shown back home, carousing over dinner and drinking beer. Then it turns out that the couple's stunning daughter (Yoshie Shimo) has brought her suitor home for the first time, an act that enrages her father beyond all reason. In his day, he howls, marriages were arranged by families and that was that. The daughter is frightened by his out-burst, and sorry to have defied his wishes. But, saddened as she is by the episode, she just doesn't understand it.Miss Hidari's film, which was sponsored by the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, is full of change and upheaval, but it has an uneventful feeling. The railway scenes lend themselves to lovely blue-gray winter tableaux, as the smoke from the trains blends with falling snow, and the troubled history of the worker's family is of interest at times. But by and large ""The Far Road"" introduces a director of evident promise whose talents are more impressive than the material upon which she has concentrated them.",1978-04-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Bolivian:Antonio Eguino's 4-Episode Feature Shown at Modern,"This year's New Directors/New Films series, under the joint sponsorship of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the film department of the Museum of Modern Art, has not been much cause for celebration until now, with the showing of ""Chuquiago."" Antonio Eguino's fine Bolivian feature will be seen at the museum today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 8:30 P.M., to close the series.""Chuquiago,"" the Indian name for the capital city that the Spaniards named La Paz, appears to be such an even-tempered film that one is well into it before recognizing the fury with which it is charged. Its dominant expression is of inscrutable calm, much the way Indians look to those of us who don't know them.""Chuquiago"" is the second feature to be directed by Mr. Eguino, who began his career as a still photographer and then became a motion-picture cameraman. The movie displays the ease of someone far more experienced, however. Its themes of rootlessness and casual corruption are the connectives for the four separate though overlapping stories that present us with a cross section of contemporary Bolivian society.The film opens when Isico (Nestor Yujra), a young Indian boy, is brought into La Paz and apprenticed by his parents to an old woman who works in the peasant marketplace. Isico, without particular direction except the need to eat and sleep, drifts into the life of a street boy, probably to become, one day, much like the drunken Indians who torment him as he moves about the city.In the second story, Johnny (Edmundo Villarreol) is an upwardly mobile Indian teen-ager, the son of hard-working parents whose Indian ways now embarrass him. Johnny drops out of school and into a life of petty crime, is conned by an agency that promises to find him work in the United States and is last seen running, though no one is chasing him.The film's third episode is both funny and scathing. It's about Carlos (David Santalia), a vain, middle-aged fellow who works in government office where bureaucracy has been raised to a kind of art. Carlos is well on his way to joining the middle class. He has five children, debts up to his ears and parrots the government political line, though he seems to have been a committed radical in his younger years. His aspirations now have to do mostly with appliances and being able to spend Friday nights on the town with his friends.The last episode is about a pretty, intelligent university student, Patricia (Tatiana Aponte), who takes one brave last stand against her conservative parents, loses the fight and winds up willingly accepting marriage with a young man who promises to be just like her fatherand possibly worse.Though each narrative is essentially bleak, the film makes its points with such humane wit that it's far from depressing experience. Mr. Eguino's achievement can be measured in the superb performances he has drawn from his actors, both professional and amateur, and in the remarkable economy with which he evokes an entire cultural and economic system in four briefly touched-on lives.""Chuquiago"" is a spare, vividly impressive work.",1978-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Mama's Spaghetti:Five at the Forum,"WE KNOW Martin Scorsese is in his parents' dining room because we can see his dinner plate, which he has evidently emptied, and because his hand occasionally reaches across the table to spear some salad. We also know he's on the premises because his parents, whose recollections of Scorsese family lore take up most of the 45-minute running time of ""Italianamerican,"" at one point begin worrying about whether one of their famous son's teeth looks funny. But for the most part, Scorsese the Director prefers to keep Scorsese the Son safely off camera, and his parents prefer to behave as if they had just made the acquaintance of a very charming stranger.By deliberately attempting to limit his own influence, Mr. Scorsese backhandedly turns himself into the film's most important figure. His parents are a bit nervous, and they clearly aren't behaving the way they ordinarily might; to heighten the formality with which they present themselves. Mr. Scorsese invites them to tell stories they've told a hundred times before, but their carefully chosen words and expansive smiles speak volumes about the pride they take in their boy's success, and the momentousness they attach to his work. It's delightful to see how flattered they are by their Marty's making them a part of his professional life.""Italianamerican"" concentrates mostly on keeping up appearances, but there are occasional lapses and digressions, all of them welcome. Mr. Scorsese, sending his mother into the kitchen to make spaghetti sauce for the camera, uses a tone that would make a drill sergeant sound like the Easter Bunny by comparison. Later, the film's closing credits include Mrs. Scorsese's recipe.Of the five films on the Film Forum's ""Scorsese's Italianamerican & Other Family Portraits,"" Mr. Scorsese's is the only one made in a spirit of affection.""Album,"" an animated short by Linda Heller, concentrates on parental repressiveness, but Miss Heller's animation is so sweetly whimsical that the sting is minimal.Equally successful, and equally fish-eyed, is Lenny Lipton's ""Happy Birthday Lenny."" Footage of an apartment, presumably the director's, is interspersed with shots of lush tropical foliage and birds flying free. All the while, a woman sobs nonstop about her son's not being tidy enough, and about the various sacrifices she has made. The credits don't specify whose voice we're hearing, but if she isn't Mama Lipton, she must be the greatest actress in the world.Jan Oxenberg's ""Home Movie"" shows a group of lesbians merrily playing football, and Miss Oxenberg uses childhood films of herself, somewhat unpleasantly, to reinforce ideas about herself that came later in life, rather than to explore the attitudes that were evident years ago.""A Visit to Indiana,"" by Curt McDowell, uses the strangely self-destructive technique of combining rough, almost unwatchable footage of an Indiana family with a sardonic voice-over conversation. The dialogue is funny, but it distracts attention from footage that is already hard to follow, and the prevailing spirit is so sarcastic it turns sour.",1978-04-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Recapturing Day of the Beatles:Out of Sight,"THE GIMMICK behind ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" is the fact that you never actually see the Beatles???; the genius of the film is the fact that you never miss them. Their likenesses turn up everywhere, plastered on record jackets and tacked on doors and walls, and their music is continually in the air.At the end of the movie, which revolves around the group's first appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" the sneakiness with which the neophyte director Robert Zemeckis skirts the issue is positively dazzling. The Beatles are both there and not there, and the paradox hardly even matters. This movie is about the fans and their hysteria, and so it's the shouts that count.The premise of the screenplay, by Mr. Zemeckis and Bob Gale, might have lent itself to a wittier and less broad treatment, but ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" plays it safe, quite successfully. If there's a tray full of food within camera range, rest assured that somebody will knock it over. If a stuck-in-the-elevator-on-the-eve-of-an-important-event routine presents itself, rest assured that its staging will be tried and true.However, Mr. Zemeckis's taste in routines of this sort is very sound, and midway through the movie he begins juggling them with such speed and dexterity that perhaps he belongs on the Sullivan program, along with such memorable actswhose names are dropped here by Will Jordan, doing his Sullivan imitationas ""Topo Gigio, the Little Italian Mouse.""In addition to Mr. Zemeckis's impressive new hand with old tricks, the film's assets include the fortuitous ambience of Beatlemania. In an atmosphere rife with weeping and screaming, a climate in which one fan can sweetly announce that she hopes Cynthia Lennon will die in a plane crash so that she can marry John, anything goes. Some routines work a lot better than others, but the whole film sparkles with a boisterous lunacy that's perfectly in keeping with the frenzy of the fans.Of course, such infectious high spirits don't come without calculation: This is a film that's quite meticulous about its innocence. Nobody gets hurt??? and the jokes stay clean. The principals are typecast straight out of anyone's high-school year-book: Best Looking (Nancy Allen), Best Personality (Wendie Jo Sperber), Most Earnest (Susan Kendall Newman), Class Weirdo (Eddie Deezen), Class Creep (Marc McClure), Town Tough Guy (Bobby Di Cicco) and Most Likely to Succeed No Matter Whose Arm She Has to Break to Do it (Theresa Saldana).The bad guys are stock characters, too: grownups, With a wicked??? wicked smile, one hotel chambermaid shakes a dark dustmop out a hotel window and snickers while the fanswho know a monton haircut when they see onego wild. When the adorably unhinged Miss Sperber who looks like a slackjawed baby elephant in stretch pants bowls over a little old lady, it's an old lady who has had the audacity to badmouth the Beatles. When one boy's father refuses to give the kid his Sullivan tickets unless his son gets rid of his Beatle haircut. Mr. Zemeckis makes the barbershop look like Death Row.When the adults in the film aren't being nasty, they're stupid, hilariously so. ""How do I know which one's Ringo?"" asks one technician in the control room for the Sullivan program. ""He's the one who plays guitar another replies. ""What guitar? There's three guitars,"" is the reply, while a title reading ""JohnSorry Girls. He's Married"" flashes on one monitor screen.And then there is Miss Allen's fianc, a stiff in the plastic furniture-cover business, who tells her proudly that ""in a couple of hours you're gonna be Mrs. Eddie Lupus."" They plan to elope, but fate has some other, wonderfully funny adventures in store for Miss Allen, who winds up doing even lewder things to one of the Beatles' bass guitars than she did to John Travolta in ""Carrie.""Miss Allen, who manages to seem years younger here than she did in ""Carrie'"" does some of her best acting with her legs, squirming and flopping about with girlish glee as she finds herself delivered, quite by accident, into the Beatles' actual hotel suite. Nobody else is around, and Miss Allen spends a few delightful moments savoring every last cigarette but???. Needless to say, when the Beatles arrive she never sees them. She hides under a bed, catches one glimpse of their boots and passes out in ecstasy.""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" which is at the Rivoli and other theaters, is an A-plus B-movie, but it's a B-movie just the same. The fine points aren't fine, the clothes and makeup are anachronistic at times, the plot falters crazily in places, and a final car chase through the streets of New York very clearly takes place in California. The teen-agers appear to range in age from 16 to 30??? and one Beatle voice has an oddly American accent.Miss Newman, daughter of Paul Newman, plays a completely implausible Beatle-hater, a lover of folk music who would never have been caught wearing makeup in 1964, even though she has lipstick on here. When she complains about the Beatles in a record store, the proprietor sneers something unpleasant about ""Jane"" Baez??? but that's nonsense: ""Jane"" sold plenty of records in her day, too.""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" which is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), include one sequence involving a prostitute. However, the woman is merely seen rubbing mustard on her client's cranium.",1978-04-21T05:00:00+0000

I suspect that Mr. Passer means the film to be a comedy about Western decadence, though ""Silver Bears,"" in failing in the flat-footed way it does, becomes, instead, an example of it.It looks very much like the sort of picture made primarily to fulfill the obligations of an international movie deal designed to be somebody's tax write-off, a project that profits no one except the people who appear to lose money on it. This, I emphasize, is speculation based on the sloppiness of the film as art and on the extravagances of the production as a whole.The cast is headed by some very good actors, lots of boringly picturesque Swiss scenery and a number of exotic locales, including marketplaces in Morocco, which substitutes for Iran and where, apparently, poverty is pretty.Among the people who appear in the film are Michael Caine and Martin Balsam, who aren't diminished by the experience, and Cybill Shepherd and Stephane Audran (two of the screen's most glorious faces), and Louis Jourdan, David Warner and Tom Smothers. All of the roles are ridiculous, though poor pacing, foolish lines, unnecessary connective scenes and badly matched shots within scenes also work against them. I hope everyone was well paid.The film opens today at the RKO 86th Street Theater and other theaters.""Silver Bears"" which has been rated PG [""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some fleeting shots of nude old men, a couple of even more fleeting shots of a not-quite-nude young woman and some mildly vulgar dialogue.",1978-04-21T05:00:00+0000

(It is on view at 521 West 57th Street through May 6.) Mr. Tapies's work made a very emphatic impression here from its first appearance, and both New York and in Paris (where he enjoyed the sponsorship that energetic dealer and critic, Michel Tapie), he was quickly established as one of the leading international painters of his generation. In recent years, however, there has been little critical discussion of his work on this side of the Atlantic.

They have feared diluting their political influence in the United States, on which Israeli security depends. They have feared contributing to the pressures on Israel from a Western world obsessed with the need for oil.

Strangest of all, ""The Rubber Gun"" is a movie that can be enjoyed even when it isn't understandable.The director, Allan Moyle, whose film was part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series last year (it opens today at the Little Carnegie), is as careful to set and sharpen the film's mood as he is reluctant to explain it. His methods are irritating at first, but they are ultimately quite memorable.A prologue to the film introduces the principals, whose real names and screen names are the same, and presents them as Montreal's hippest bunch of drug-smugglers, members of a band that the narrator would very much like to infiltrate. This narrator, played by Mr. Moyle, is a shy sociologist, and his motives at first seem purely professional. But as the film progresses, he becomes more and more enmeshed in, and compromised by, what he sees.The central figure in the communal family Mr. Moyle so admires is an artist, glamourpuss and father hen named Steve Lack. Mr. Lack, who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Moyle and John Laing, and who co-produced the movie, presents himself as a young, high-adrenaline jokester, and his delivery is successful enough to make even the slangy or half-audible lines sound funny.But Mr. Lack also has his serious side, a side that is concerned with the commune's disintegration. The film means to use this family's breakup as a way of encapsulating the end of an era, and that's too tall an order. But it does succeed in careening unexpectedly from drug-haze episodes to important clashes of ethics and temperament, and Mr. Moyle's direction never turns maudlin or cute.Instead, his style suggests the probing and grittinss of John Cassavetes's films. Mr. Moyle's work is less passionate than Mr. Cassavetes's, but also a bit more crisp. In both cases, for every glowing moment there are a fair share of flat ones. And the technique is often much more overpowering than the material to which it is applied.",1978-04-24T05:00:00+0000

Lise Tanquerelle (Ann Girardot) is a pretty divorce, with a pretty young daughter, a pretty, youngish mother and a pretty youngish aunt, and they all live together in a pretty sylvan cottage that seems to be in the center of a very pretty Paris. Lise, who is a detective with the Paris police, also has a twinkle in her eye.If Philippe De Broca's ""Dear Detective"" does nothing else (and it doesn't), it proves that so much prettiness can be poisonous and that two twinkles are one too many for any movie not intended to make the viewer throw up.""Dear Detective,"" which opens today at the Sutton Theater, tries too hard to be pleasant. It has the manner of someone who grovels at one's feet. One's first reaction is not to smile but to kickwhich is the way I've felt about all of Mr. De Broca's recent films. There's nothing inherently wrong with pleasant movies except when they are as relentlessly phony as his have been.""Dear Detective"" pretends to be a comedy sympathetic to a liberated woman, the female detective, but it attempts to get most of its laughs by such things as having her worry about her hair, chase a suspected murderer with curlers still in place and deal with the professor's outrage when he learns she's a cop.Though Miss Girardot and Mr. Noiret have given fine performances in the past, neither has a single redeeming moment in this failed farce.

Most of the film is devoted to scenes (many splendid ones) taken from 17 Chaplin comedies, including ""City Lights,"" ""The Gold Rush,"" ""Modern Times"" and ""The Kid.""There's an attempt to recapitulate highlights of Chaplin's lifeboth good times and badwith newsreel footage, as well as with still photographs, some of which are accompanied by lofty quotations from Chaplin's book, ""My Autobiography."" The quotations, read by Laurence Olivier, come off worse on film than they do on the printed page: ""In Philadelphia I discovered Emerson,"" says Chaplin, meaning, I suppose, Ralph Waldo. As in ""My Autobiography,"" there's also a good deal of nameor photographdropping, to prove that Charlie hobnobbed with swells of his time, including Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and George Bernar Shaw.Some of the film is dreadful, as when we hear a gossip-columnist, who sounds like Hedda Hopper, as she attacks Charlie, but a lot of the comedy footage is still fun, even if out of context. The nicest moments, though, are the home movies in which we see the elderly Charlie and his wife, Oona. They seem to have been a truly happy couple.",1978-04-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Scorsese and the Band:Final Fling,"MARTIN SCORSESE had the makings of a better-than-average concert movie at his disposal when he made ""The Last Waltz,"" but the film is full of evidence that Mr. Scorsese had something more ambitious in mind. One exquisitely edited sequence of the Band performing ""The Weight,"" filmed on a soundstage by cameras that sway and rotate with the music, infuses the interaction of a rock band with more joy and lyricism than any other rock film has ever approached. A guest appearance at the concert by the singer Van Morrison, now paunchy and balding but triumphantly galvanizing just the same, makes for a moment rich with both euphoria and regret.Mr. Scorsese's decision to train his cameras more closely on the musicians' faces than on their instruments leads to an unexpected examination of the physical and emotional costliness of their craft, and of the element of acting that's an integral part of any kind of live performance. Indeed, Mr. Scorsese manages to turn Rick Danko, the Band's bassist, into a veritable double for one of the director's favorite actors, Robert De Niro.""The Last Waltz,"" which opens today at the Ziegfeld Theater, is Mr. Scorsese's record of a 1976 Thanks-giving concert given by the Bandand several of their most famous friends, like Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton and Bob Dylanto mark the group's farewell to live performing.However definite the show's raison d'tre may have been, though, its spirit remains strangely ambiguous. Members of the Band, interviewed by Mr. Scorsese afterward in footage that is interspersed among the songs, speak about the performance almost noncommittally, and their offhandedness is contagious.If this wasn't a particularly sad or celebratory occasion for them, it can't mean much to the viewer either, unless the one approaches the film with a full set of memories of the principals in better days. A peculiarly myopic view of the aging process is also required, if one is to find ""The Last Waltz"" unusually stirring. The life of a rock star may be more draining than the life of a Maytag repairman, but when the film tries to milk too much from every last sign of wear and tear, it comes dangerously close to self-importance and self-pity.One of the Band's most fascinating idiosyncrasies has always been its combination of a strong group identity with the virtual anonymity of individual members. The group identity has also been powerfully visual, reinforced by album-cover photographs that make the musicians out to be woodsy and austere, so deliberately antiquated looking that they summon up an impression of simpler times.""The Last Waltz"" takes pains to introduce them as individuals, in interviews that are slack at times but occasionally very winning. Other group members explain, for instance, that in their early days the bashful organist Garth Hudson demanded $10 a week from each of them, ostensibly for music lessons. Only later, they realized that the classically trained Mr. Hudson was too embarrassed to tell his family he was working as a rock-and-roller, and was instead claiming to have found a few teaching jobs.The interviews are uneven, but their function is to amplify. On the other hand, the setting for the concertan elegant stage backed by drapes and candelabra  is mightily incongruous with the Band's group identity, and the mismatch is more disruptive than illuminating. A guest appearance by the very Las Vegasy Neil Diamond, one of whose albums was recently produced by the Band's leader, Robbie Robertson, is so jarring and unwelcome that the movie takes minutes to recover. And Mr. Scorsese's efforts to stir up a distinct visual style for the film, a style that might somehow have compensated for the curious lack of sentiment that marks all but the film's final half-hour, are so half-hearted and sporadic they become almost maddening.Just think of the rich visual eloquence with which Mr. Scorsese was able to invest a simple Checker cab in ""Taxi Driver,"" and just notice that all he supplies here are a waltzing couple behind the credits and some smoke clouds. Given that, you can't help realizing that for all its impressive musical accomplishments, ""The Last Waltz"" is a great lost opportunity. There is a dazzling array of talent on display here, and the film surely has its memorable moments. But it articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints atand some of Mr. Scorsese's accomplishments have been so stunningthat it's impossible to view ""The Last Waltz"" as anything but an also-ran.",1978-04-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'F.I.S.T.,' Drama of Unionism:Stallone Returns","OF ALL THE STORIES of organized labor, the most fascinatingperhaps because it seems the most Americanhas been the rise to power and affluence of the corruption-riddled International Brotherhood of American Teamsters, whose one-time president, James Hoffa, disappeared in 1975 and is now presumed to have been the victim of a one-way ride ordered by his sometime gangland associates.Using material freely drawn from the Hoffa story, as well as from the recent history of the United Mine Workers of America, the director Norman Jewison has made ""F.I.S.T.,"" a pop epic that covers 30 crucial years in the life of the fictitious Federation of Inter-State Truckers, from feeble beginnings to its emergence as an organization as powerful and corrupt as any of the industries it did business with.""F.I.S.T.,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 1 and 2 and at other theaters, doesn't run especially deep but it runs long and, more important, it runs wide. It presents in the form of a diorama the story of F.I.S.T. from its origins in idealism and compromise, through its early successes, to the point in the late 1950's when a Senate committee, much like the one headed by the late Senator John L. McClellan, brought the nation's attention to bear on the union's extraordinary wealth, to the quixotic way in which that wealth was administered, and to its widespread underworld connections.Specialists in the history of the Teamsters may not be particularly pleased with ""F.I.S.T."" Being movie fiction aimed at the mass market, it sets its early scenes in the depressed 30's, with all of the poor-boy clichs so dear to hearts of movie makers. The central character, that of Johnny Kovak, is played by Sylvester Stallone with a combination of brute power and arrogance that are convincing, but with little of the shrewdness, charm and murderous cynicism that made Jimmy Hoffa so successful and such popular copy for so many years. Mr. Stallone's Johnny Kovak is a rat who's all heart.Yet once ""F.I.S.T."" disposes of the obligatory exposition that is the opening section of the picture, it becomes a compelling demonstration of a kind of power manipulation that is as integral to big capital as it is to big labor. The movie, which pictures the Depression in the golden glow of something sweetly remembered (as did ""Bound for Glory""), becomes increasingly tough as it gains momentum and, at the end, genuinely tragic, not because of the fate of Johnny Kovak but because of the social and political implications. If this system doesn't work, which one will?The screenplay, written by Joe Eszterhas and Mr. Stallone, based on a story by Mr. Eszterhas, is not great. There is, for example, a key scene early-on, in which we are supposed to be witness to the manner by which Johnny Kovak mesmerizes the union brotherhood, yet the speech itself simply isn't very rousing. We may not believe the way Johnny works his way to the top, yet the machinations by which he consolidates his power and exercises it brings the movie to real life.""F.I.S.T."" is a big movie that benefits more from the accumulation of small, ordinary detail than from any particular wit or inspiration of vision. It's also played with great conviction by its huge cast.There's never any doubt that Mr. Stallone is the star, but the other actors Mr. Jewison has collected are not overwhelmed by the Stallone mannerisms.Chief among these are Melinda Dillon as the Lithuanian sewing-machine girl Johnny Kovak courts and marries; David Huffman as his boyhood friend, a fellow who shares Johnny's rise to the top but refuses to compromise; Tony Lo Bianco as the mobster who makes Johnny's earlier successes possible and who stays around to collect his debts; Kevin Conway as another boyhood friend who provides Johnny with his introduction to the mob, and Peter Boyle as the crooked F.I.S.T. president Johnny eventually succeeds.They're all excellent. Even Rod Steiger, whose recent performances have not been memorable, makes us pay attention to the crusading senator whose mission to expose crooked union practices may or may not be for the highest of motives. The vanity is always visible.Like ""Fiddler on The Roof,"" ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Rollerball,"" Mr. Jewison's last three films, ""F.I.S.T."" is a massive, essentially shapeless film, but because it's about a terrifically interesting, complicated subject, shapeliness doesn't seem especially important. There's not a moment in it to compare with the intensity of feelings contained in such documentaries as ""Union Maids"" and ""Harlan County, U.S.A.,"" yet it's encouraging to hear Hollywood talking about such things at a time when play-it-safe is virtually industry policy.""F.I.S.T.,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some vividly accurate scenes of labor violence and some mildly vulgar language.",1978-04-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Ship wrecked With 'The Sea Gypsies':In Alaska's Wilds,"THE first fun filled minutes of ""The Sea Gypsies,"" the latest attraction at the Radio City Music Hall, are enough to fill anyone with nameless dread. Television news crews flock to a Seattle marina, to interview a handsome young widower who plans to sail his yacht around the world, accompanied by his two cute blond daughters, their cute tawny mutt, Mushroom, and (unbenownst to anyone but all 6,000 of us in the audience) a cute young black stowaway named Jesse.Just before sailing time, who should arrive on deck but a cute female magazine reporter, who has been assigned to go along on the journey in place of an (undoubtedly) cute male reporter who has conveniently broken his leg. Is there any doubt as to how this will end? Can anyone seriously question the likelihood of Dad's falling in love with the reporter? Isn't it a sure thing that everyone will live happily ever after, off the profits from the movie sale of the best-selling book Step-Mom will write about the cruise?Miraculously, ""The Sea Gypsies"" turns into smooth sailing, and a very agreeable children's film, not long after the yacht pulls prettily out of the harbor. The obligatory storm sinks the boat, and the family is marooned somewhere on the Alaskan coast, amidst caribou, sea lions, and some of the loveliest snow-capped mountains in the world.Since it is summertime, the elements don't pose any severe problems for this Seattle Family Robinson, and so they can sleep in a lean-to and bask in the sunshine. Foraging, for food is a more difficult matter. Question: How can a Dad kill a caribou or a musk ox with only a homemade spear for a weapon? Answer: He can't, in a family movie like this one. The best he can do is come close enough to slaughter something, look into its limpid brown eyes, melt into a puddle of sympathy and then go out and catch fish, whose eyes aren't nearly so compelling. Parents who plan to take small children to see the film should note that G rating notwithstanding, the one sequence in which Dad does actually hunt some meat ends with the carcass's being torn apart, in close-up by a pack of wolves.The scenery is spectacular, the Alaskan birds and animals are well photographed, and the film's various lessons in survival are memorable and well worth learning. After a while, one develops an unexpected fondness not only for the principals but also for their pelican, Pinocchio, and for the pet sea lion who goes ""arf-arf-arf"" in moments of merriment.And the acting, while unexceptional, is more than competent. Mikki Jamison-Olsen is perky and agreeable as the reporter, and Robert Logan is a good-humored Dad; together, they're a fun couple. Shannon Saylor, as the younger daughter, is so precious she makes the sea lion look like Greta Garbo. But Heather Rattray, as the older daughter, and Cjon Damitri Patterson, as the stowaway, are spirited, personable child actors with a mercifully clear understanding that less is generally more.",1978-04-27T05:00:00+0000

The strikers are the staff of Los Angeles's hippest radio station, and they are standing up against corporate hypocrisy, standing up for hipsters everywhere, telling the Establishment where it can get off. The throngs are so fired with admiration that they are on the verge of rioting, when suddenly the much-beloved station manager, Jeff Dugan (Michael Brandon), makes a plea for sanity and brotherhood. The strikers will give up, he says sadly. But, he promises, ""we'll give you what you want and if we can't do it here, we'll do it someplace else.""""No you won't!"" croaks someone in the audience. The someone proves to be the station's curmudgeonly old owner, and he has been so moved by his staff's honesty, integrity and general panache that he is now willing to let them do everything just as they please. Good vibes will prevail, and the profits will be damned. And so ends the sort of episode that one might have thought went out with Day-Glo paint and strobe lights.""FM,"" which opens today at the Criterion and 86th Street Twin 2 Theaters, turns into a preposterously self-serving variation on 1960's themes. It also falls into another grand tradition, that of the 70's movie-in-search-of-a-Jello-mold. These days evidently, it is possible to bankroll a film merely by suggesting a suitably hang-loose environment: car wash, hippie newspaper office, hippie radio station, country music town, high school, drugstore, musty old attic, whatever.If this sort of thing were only being done by the George Lucases and Robert Altmans of this world, it might amount to something. But since ""American Graffiti"" and ""Nashville,"" none of the bungled movies in this newly amorphous spirit have significantly broken ground.Instead, they wind up double-dealing, keeping up contemporary appearances with loud rock soundtracks while falling back on the hoariest movie devices. ""FM"" at various times comparesnot at all favorablywith ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" a wide variety of soap operas, ""Network"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""The film's premise has to do with the corporate co-option of hip enterprise. QSKY, a popular station evidently owned by a conglomerate, is under pressure to play more commercials and turn a bigger profit, and the station's personnel feel too responsible to their audience to let these changes take place without a fight. The problem is certainly a real one, for rock radio stations everywhere. But Ezra Sacks's screenplay manages, by taking this crisis so very, very seriously, not to take it seriously at all.One bone of contention, for instance, involves the staff's unwillingness to broadcast rock jingles advertising the new ""fun"" Army, jingles that turn up on real radio stations everywhere.Instead of sending up these ads gently or letting them work as automatic self-parody, Mr. Sacks insists on calling in the troops, quite literally, and machine-gunning a potentially stinging episode to death. His script introduces a giggling, unhinged, pot-smoking Army officer who merrily suggests that perhaps we went to Vietnam just to commandeer their marijuana supply.John A, Alonzo, the former cinematographer who directed the film, is still very much a cinematographer; he specializes in up-to-the-minute, very Robert Altman-ish, slow, pull-back shots that are slightly, piquantly out of kilter. The look of the film is convincing, and its soundtrack very well-chosen. The hair and costumes are particularly effective, rich with an amusingly studied casualness that seems apt. Mr. Alonzo has also assembled a number of gifted satirical actors to play the station's superstars. But his direction is so frequently slack, and Mr. Sacks's script so frequently dopey, that the players seldom have enough to do.Eileen Brennan plays the station's night-shift seductress, and her very tone of voice is enough to bring on a hoot or two. Mr. Sacks, however, gives her nothing more interesting to work with than the character's growing weariness with rock-and-roll. Michael Brandon, who was so appealing as the young groom in ""Lovers and Other Strangers,"" delivers the script's jiviest lines in a seductively deadpan style. Martin Mull, who is more or less playing Ted Knight, has some very funny moments, one of them a wonderful pantomime battle with Mr. Brandon, a battle so full of earnest sensitivity and psycho-hooey that Mr. Mull ends up tearfully sucking his thumb.""FM,"" which is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), is full of buxom, imbecilic women just dying to fling themselves at the station's superstars. Mr. Mull manages to catch most of them.",1978-04-28T05:00:00+0000

It turns out to be the rapidly growing fetus of an Indian medicine man who lived 400 years ago. How come? Don't ask.Surgeons try excision instead of exorcism only to have their scalpels turn in their hands. When they focus a laser on the enlarging protuberance, the beam goes out of control and burns holes all over the operating room.So, despite all the efforts of medical science, the medicine man is reborn, hideously deformed by the X-rays used in the diagnosis. Hunched over Miss Strasberg's corpse, he begins tuning up his malefic vibrations, and San Francisco, where the story takes place, begins to tremble again. The city and, for all we know, the world, seems to be on the verge of destruction until . . .The conflict in ""The Manitou,"" which opens today at Loews State 2, the Orpheum and other theaters, isn't so much between good and evil Indian spirits as it is between seasoned performers, among them Tony Curtis, Stella Stevens, Burgess Meredith, Michael Ansara and Miss Strasberg, and an absurd penny-dreadful script and a cheapjack production.

Last month's red ink  $2.8 billion  was a decided improvement over February's record $4.5 billion deficit, but it was 'still the fifth largest on the Commerce Department's books. Imports of oil fell to $3.1 billion, a $900 million drop that the department said was aided by increasing Alaska oil production. Steel imports also declined during March, when the Treasury Department's trigger pricing system for imports of the metal went into effect. ... Free trade won an hardfought first round when the House Ways and Means Committee rejected by a vote of 21 to 16 an attempt to overturn President Carter's decision to deny import relief to the American manufacturers of metal fasteners.

The four somersaults are not the risk for Tito; he has flown them innumerable times. But [at this writing] Tito has not yet been caught in public. Being caught is the risk. Here two elements seem to be operating dynamically. Tito has a fantasy that he will injure the catcher. His focus on this loss and the anxiety it produces prevents him from letting himself be caught. But this fantasy is linked subtly to yet another. A successful catch, as Culhane points out to Tito (who largely agrees with the interpretation), may lead to separation from his family and a confrontation with a decision to marry. Tito sees independence from family and involvement with a woman as a loss. As he turns into the fourth somersault, Tito enters the fear zone (which clouds the gains), touches the catcher and falls to the net. But my money is on Tito. One of these days I feel he will break through the fear zone, let go, that is, get caught by his catcher  and possibly by a",1978-04-30T05:00:00+0000

It is made of oil, vinegar, a trifling amount of egg yolk, plus a touch of heavy cream to thin it. It is, in fact, made like a mayonnaise. The heavy cream tends to give a smoothness to the dressing, and it also prevents the dressing from breaking down or separating once it is made.
