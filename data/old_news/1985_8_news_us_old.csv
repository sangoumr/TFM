Remodeling always meant fluorescent lights, fake pine paneling - it was the kiss of death. But on a bright, crisp Sunday morning in January when the snow was 20 inches deep, I saw this, and suddenly there was a sense of finding the right place.''",1985-08-01T05:00:00+0000

He labeled seven of his own books - including ''The Third Man'' and ''Our Man in Havana'' - ''entertainments,'' as if to tell the reader that these titles did not carry the full weight of his seriousness. Of course, they did; a fine writer cannot help doing his best, even when his subjects are designed to entertain. In recent years, Mr. Greene himself recognized this.

Wilbert Montgomery, the running back who had complained about austerity measures imposed by the Philadelphia Eagles' new owner, Norman Braman, withdrew his request for a trade.. . . Dan Marino, the quarterback who is seeking a renegotiation of his contract, told the Miami Dolphins' owner, Joe Robbie, that he would end his walkout and return to training camp immediately if Robbie would agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. Robbie, asserting that salary arbitration has ''done serious damage to major league baseball,'' said he would have no part in introducing the practice to professional football, but made a counterproposal. He said he would meet with Marino as soon as he returned to camp. . . .

Because the fire on March 25, 1911, in New York City's Triangle Shirtwaist Factory killed 146 persons who were mostly young immigrant women, it reached into homes in Russia, Austria, Palestine, Jamaica, Hungary, Rumania and England. The fire reached into most American homes, ultimately, through New Deal reform legislation. Leon Stein, of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union - whose organizing efforts were spurred by the fire - interviewed survivors while writing his 1962 book. Tom Brooks wrote in The Book Review that Mr. Stein ''recreate[d] the tragic events of the fire in all their dramatic intensity.'' MRS. MINIVER, by Jan Struther. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $3.95.) ''Mrs. Miniver'' is about the impact of World War II on traditional, prosperous English family life.

A topic is chosen - parents and teen-agers, say, or teen-age sexuality, which is the topic for today's program - and teen-agers discuss it. Mr. Cottle, a psychologist, moderates the discussion. He is a benign presence, perched on a wooden crate (the teen-agers perch on crates, too) and he allows the teen-agers to talk, while mostly he listens. Occasionally, he asks a question, and, once in a while, he makes a judgment. Beneath the discussions, meanwhile, is the assumption that when problems are talked about, light is shed in dark corners. Problems become easier to bear. This is also the assumption beneath psychoanalysis and, to an extent, confessions in church.

CAMUS said that Kafka's art consisted in forcing the reader to reread. The same holds true for Robert Duncan, if for opposite reasons. His work is difficult right on the surface. His sheer reach and range of associations and patterning are so complex that the reader is forced to scan the page as one scans a horizon and register some sense of a visual whole before proceeding to the parts. Since ''The Opening of the Field'' (1960), he has been engaged in a search for what Alfred North Whitehead calls ''the right chaos, the right vagueness.'' But for all his erudition and allusiveness, he is not a poet for scholars only. If his oeuvre can fairly be viewed as a grand collage, the leaps, gaps and juxtapositions stimulate the reader to uncover, in his words, ''resonances of meaning exceeding what we / understand, words freed from their origins.''",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

But analysts say Mr. Garcia's Government could find the new program politically impalatable, and Peru could find it more difficult to negotiate directly with Western bankers than with the I.M.F.",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

The title character in Miss Welty's short story, ''Why I Live at the P.O.,'' can seem ever so reasonable. How could Sister, as she is called, share a home with her spoiled younger sibling, Stella-Rondo, who stole her beau, Mr. Whitaker, ''the only man who dropped down in China Grove?'' Sister's jealousy and her anger at other members of her family lead her, headlong, to setting up residence in her place of business, the ''next to smallest'' post office in the State of Mississippi.'' Listening to her monologue, we realize that there is an obsessive personality at work. Sister is a single voice of honesty in a world of self-deceivers, whose guardian angel might as well be Cousin Annie Flo, who ''went to her grave denying the facts of life.''",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

By chance rescue and family heroics, they came to number themselves among the tiny minority of their schoolmates who survived the bomb, but they retained disfigurements so grotesque that they eventually huddled together in a sorority of pity.

Lubbock was particularly concerned with how the novelist handled his ''point of view,'' that is, the way his story was apprehended by the reader, and he considered James and Flaubert the masters of this technique and Tolstoy a lax practitioner. The last time I reread ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' in the splendid C. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin translation, I found myself wishing that Lubbock had included Proust in his study because, for the first time, I was conscious of a flaw in that great work that seemed attributable to a confusion in the point of view from which the story is told.",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

THE trouble with anniversaries, as President Reagan now has reason to know, is that they tend to call forth ghosts. Whatever his intentions in going to the military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany, that gesture only confirmed how much more difficult it is to bury the memory of the past than its victims. Ironically, though, the visit to Bitburg appears to have crowded out another specter that was hovering around the edges of our consciousness only a few months ago - the ghost of Yalta. The 40th anniversary of that conference moved the President himself to proclaim, this past February, that Yalta symbolized ''the dividing line between freedom and repression,'' a boundary that ''can never be made legitimate'' and that ''I do not hesitate to say . . . we wish to undo.'' President Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, seized upon the occasion to condemn Yalta in the pages of Foreign Affairs as ''a synonym for betrayal,'' and to call for a new effort to undo - peacefully, to be sure - the division of Europe. Both men thereby revived the tradition, once much in vogue among American politicians, of Yalta bashing.",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Big and rich and mouth-filling, with lots of body, color and alcohol? Or should it be lighter, leaner, more ''sculpted,'' which is a word Robert Mondavi likes to use for this newer style of wine. Ten years ago, cabernet was judged by its muscles. A great cabernet was characterized by inky dark color, bouquet that could fill a room and flavors that hit you right between the eyes. Alcohol content hovered around 15 percent and more, even if the label didn't always say so. It was closer to sippin' whisky than table wine. It turned teeth purple and imposed long siestas on anyone who drank it at midday. There were critics, a carping few, but no one to pay them heed.

Yet as if such natural endowments were not enough, there is also a cache of jewel-like parks and public gardens - all of which are ever so inviting, ever so cleverly planted and ever so astonishingly cared for. Herewith a potpourri for visitors. Queen Elizabeth Park, a former rock quarry of 130 sloping acres, is at the metropolitan area's geographical center. The requisite putting greens and tennis courts are there, of course, but so are sunken gardens with velvety lawns etched with serpentine beds of flowers. Seen first from the high spot - 500 feet above sea level - the cheerful patterns are a fitting foreground for mountainous views beyond.

IN 1975, when Richard J. Daley was re-elected to an unprecedented sixth term as Mayor of Chicago, there were many voters who could not remember a time when someone else had held that office. Presidents came and went; Daley endured, his power rooted in the vaunted political machine that he relied upon and controlled. His death in 1976 opened a decade of political instability and conflict. Jane Byrne's defeat of Mayor Michael Bilandic in the 1979 Democratic primary shocked the machine politicians who had anointed Mr. Bilandic Daley's successor. United States Representative Harold Washington's victory over Mayor Byrne and Daley's son Richard M. Daley, the State's Attorney, four years later in the Democratic primary and the Congressman's subsequent defeat of Bernard Epton, a Republican, in the general election were even more aston-ishing. What had once seemed impossible was, in 1983, a reality: Chicago had elected a black mayor.",1985-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Unfortunately, anyone who has seen Brandt's pioneering work of the 1930's in exhibition in the last 25 years has seen it only through the mediation of these prints, and probably has taken them to be faithful representations of Brandt's photography.

Famous for its early American charm, Emily Shaw's Inn in Pound Ridge has long been a popular spot for celebrating special occasions, entertaining out-of-town guests and holding small business meetings. Thus it is a pity that in the six years we have visited the restaurant, management after management and chef after chef haven't been able to meet the high standard set by this handsome building. Food aside, they have somehow failed to see what many diners must: badly chipped plates, bent utensils, wines listed without vintage, soiled menus, poorly paced service - elements that can be corrected without damaging the preserved status, the history of the place.

Standard fare at Paris cafes is the crusty buttered baguette with ham and Gruyere, the melted cheese sandwich known as the croque-monsieur, rillettes - a terrine of preserved pork - pates, crudites, omelettes, quiches and coffees that range from the frothy cafe creme to the more intense espresso.",1985-08-07T05:00:00+0000

The same might easily be said of every other character in this novel, as well as the author himself. Though enlivened by patches of nasty black comedy and splashes of nervous irony, ''Inner Tube'' - which opens with a suicide and then moves on to more depressing subjects - is one of the most relentlessly bleak works I've come across in a long time. Reading it is a lot like staying up all night, listening to a stranger you don't particularly like tell and retell the story of his life in stoned, didactic monologues. It's not something you're likely to forget right away. On the other hand, it doesn't make for a particularly pleasant - or illuminating - evening, either.",1985-08-07T05:00:00+0000

According to Harry Gamble, the club's general manager, the new owner, Norman Braman, who is on a campaign to hold down salaries, has no intention of giving in to the players' demands. ''We're absolutely not going to renegotiate contracts, especially those with several years to go on them,'' Gamble said. One of the five holdouts, Dennis Harrison, a defensive end, is entering the option year of his contract and wants a raise. The others, Wilbert Montgomery, a running back; Mike Quick, a wide receiver; Jerry Robinson, a linebacker, and Dean Miraldi, an offensive tackle, say that the Eagles' former owner, Leonard Tose, had promised to renegotiate their contracts. Under league rules, a team can put as many as five players on a reserve-left-camp list that prohibits the players from being reactivated until the following season. Gamble said that no deadline had been set, but that time was running out for the holdouts. ''There will come a time soon when we will have to make a decision,'' he said. . . . Ray Childress, the Houston Oiler defensive end who is staying away from training camp in an effort to force a renegotiation of his contract, said he was prepared to sit out the entire season if the Oilers didn't meet his demand for a four-year, $2 million contract or trade him to a team that would.",1985-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Much of it is closed, never to be reopened. 1974 - The Westway project is proposed to create a new West Side Highway and redevelop the West Side corridor. Opponents sue to block it. Hugh L. Carey, after winning the election for Governor, reverses his opposition to the project. 1977 - The State Transportation Department applies to the Army Corps of Engineers for a Hudson River landfill permit. 1978 - Edward I. Koch, after winning election as Mayor, reverses himself and backs the Westway project. 1981 - The Corps of Engineers issues a dredging and landfill permit. President Reagan presents the city with a symbolic $85 million check to buy rights of way, declaring that ''the Westway project begins today.'' 1982 - Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court blocks the permit, saying the corps did not adequately consider the landfill's effects on striped-bass hatcheries in the Hudson River. 1983 - A report commissioned by Governor Cuomo favors abandoning the Westway project and trading in the money for mass-transit funds. The Governor rejects the recommendation. 1984 - The Corps of Engineers holds public hearings on the project and its environmental impact, especially the effects on striped bass. 1985 - The corps issues a new permit, and the matter returns to Judge Griesa.",1985-08-08T05:00:00+0000

They don't have to be justified so much as propounded. Consider, for example, two television programs, one past, one yet to come, both dealing with roughly the same topic - the dropping of the atomic bomb and all that has happened since.

ALTHOUGH Henry VIII is best known for his radical solutions to his marital troubles, in Jasper Ridley's new biography Great Harry's tyranny pales in comparison with his genius for politically terrorizing an entire nation. With wry, cynical wit, Mr. Ridley, whose other biographies include ''Lord Palmerston,'' demolishes the characterizations of former biographers who portrayed a promising young humanist gradually corrupted by such powerful and evil bureaucrats as Cardinal Wolsey and Henry's secretary, Thomas Cromwell, later Earl of Essex. In Mr. Ridley's persuasive view, Henry was no fallen angel. He was always cruel, his eyes no less piggy in the golden opening years of his reign (when at 17 he befriended famous European intellectuals like Erasmus and Sir Thomas More) than when they look at us out of Holbein's famous portrait, where we see King Henry, legs apart, arms akimbo, the perfect picture of arbitrary and absolute patriarchal power, the huge tun of a man we know from the bloated shape of his armor in the Tower of London, the man who ended up as a plague to his people.",1985-08-11T05:00:00+0000

McC., Manhattan Answer: No. Only rent-regulated tenants age 62 or over who are not receiving public assistance, who have a disposable household income of no more than $10,000 and whose rent is one-third or more of their monthly income can apply for exemption from rent increases through a city program known as SCRIE - Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption. The landlord receives a certificate for a tax abatement equal to the amount of the exemption. For more information, write SCRIE, 17 John Street, 4th floor, New York, N. Y. 10038 or call 566-5541. Preferential Rent Question: I just heard of something called preferential rent. What is this? . . . J. W., Manhattan Answer: Preferential rents, which are usually for family members or friends of the owner, are rents lower than the Redinger legal maximum. A tenant with a preferential rent has all the rights and obligations of those under the rent regulations, according to Nathaniel Geller, assistant deputy counsel in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. When the lease expires or the tenant vacates, the maximum lawful rent can be restored. Previous Commitment Question: I have a three-year lease, written by a previous owner, with an option to renew for three more years because of improvements I made. Can the new owner refuse to honor my option? . . . L. B., Manhattan Answer: If you have an option in writing signed by the previous owner, this is a contractual right that the new owner cannot abrogate even though state law no longer obliges landlords to offer leases of longer than two years, according to Mr. Geller and other lawyers.",1985-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Now that libraries are no longer the main purchasers of children's books, publishers are becoming increasingly conservative about the titles they release. Knowing only what has sold, not what will sell, in the last five years they have been churning out a steady supply of illustrated gift editions of standard works in the public domain. Parents just cannot read every new story that comes out each year, so they generally buy the titles they enjoyed.

us,"PAYING BY DISEASE, NOT BY THE DAY","THE promise of medical science never seemed brighter - researchers are continually finding effective new drugs, devices and therapies. But the cost of it all is rising faster than the rate of inflation, and faster than the Federal deficit. With bipartisan agreement, Washington has imposed stringent cost controls on its biggest health program, Medicare, which provides insurance for doctor and hospital costs for 30 million elderly and disabled people. Medicare now pays hospitals a set amount for each case, depending on the diagnosis, regardless of how long the patient is hospitalized. This system, being put into effect over a three-year period that began in October 1983, has given hospitals new incentives to economize. But some members of Congress and many physicians say it has adversely affected the quality of care, prompting some hospitals to discharge patients prematurely. A recent study found that the system of fixed payment rates for each of 468 diagnostic categories discriminates against certain hospitals because it ''does not adequately reflect the complexity and severity of illness'' and the variations among patients with the same diagnosis. A spokesman for the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that runs Medicare, agreed some adjustment was needed. Private employers and insurance companies are also cracking down on costs. In the new competitive climate, doctors, hospitals and nursing homes are seeking new, more efficient ways to deliver care. To analyze these trends, The Week in Review called on two experts: Professor Karen Davis, an economist who is chairman of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, and Dr. Raymond Scalettar, a trustee of the American Medical Association who specializes in internal medicine in Washington, D.C.

There are worse things than giving good performances in films that get little attention - giving terrible performances in very popular films, for example - but tell that to Mr. Costner.

''Mitridate'' is a three-act opera seria in the most formal 18th-century style, with the usual royal despot who magnanimously relents and the tangled romantic plot typical of this genre. There is no way such a stylized work can be turned into a tongue-in-cheek parody without its essence being sacrificed. That, unfortunately, is what often happened in this otherwise welcome performance, which on the whole was beautifully sung but which had to bear the burden of a rib-poking narration that continually undermined the young composer's purposes.",1985-08-16T05:00:00+0000

This is the same form you would fill out if you operated a shoe repair or a greengrocer's, ran a shop that sold handbags or pasta or cameras or martial regaia. I've been filling out a Schedule C for some years now but this was the first time I saw the potential humor in a poet's applying its language to his own queer occupation. The form refers to accounting methods and bad debts, to inventory (''Let's see, I've got three poems I haven't yet sent out to magazines, or four if you count the one that's missing a middle quartrain'') and depreciation (''in retrospect, I suppose my 'Ode to Lunch' probably isn't imperishable'').",1985-08-18T05:00:00+0000

Its backpacking, mountaineering, sailing and other outdoor activities include courses for women only, some for the 35 and over age group. Tuition generally costs from $50 to $90 a day, including meals and accommodations but not travel to the course. There are about 25 Outward Bound schools in Europe, Australia, Asia and other parts of the world, and some of them, according to a spokesman at the national headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., offer expeditions specifically for women. The national office expects to complete the catalogue for its 1986 programs in the United States by the end of this month. (There are five Outward Bound centers in the U.S. and two in Canada.) It also has some details about courses in other countries and can supply the addresses of Outward Bound centers abroad.

Like the woman who wrote them, they are private, public, political and international. Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in these pages that Mr. Lash's book helps ''provide the proper context in which to understand those letters'' and offers ''new insights into Mrs. Roosevelt's sometimes puzzling personality.'' A companion hard-cover volume, ''A World of Love,'' collects Mrs. Roosevelt's letters from the 40's to her death in 1962. THE THIN RED LINE, by James Jones. (Laurel/Dell, $5.95.) James Jones's World War II novel is about the men of Charlie Company, fighting on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. In 1962 Maxwell Geismar wrote here that it ''moves so intensely and inexorably that it almost seems like the war it is describing. . . . The special magic of Jones as a writer is that, discarding all the cliches and slogans of patriotism, of heroism and of war itself, remaining so absolutely honest about his theme, he yet manages to make these typical American fighting men both universally human, and exceptional.''

The drama was not veristically represented, but the soloists were robed -Christus in white, the others in vaguely clerical garb - and moved about freely as they sang. The Evangelist, who delivers the basic scriptural narration, stood at the front; Jesus, the other characters in the drama and the aria soloists were on a raised platform behind the orchestra, with the chorus arrayed behind and above them. Over their heads was suspended an enormous ornamental cross, flush to the underside of the bank of acoustical panels on the ceiling of Tanglewood's shed.

But historians of popular culture rarely treat them as isolated events significant in themselves. The tendency is to put these moments in a context of a broader, more general understanding of the music's history. According to this point of view, Mr. Presley's triumph belongs entirely to the 1950's, though he gave one of the most inspired performances of his life much later, on his 1968 television special. This view makes up in coherence what it lacks in attention to detail -tracing popular music from decade to decade is much neater than following the messy, multidirectional flow of musical influences and inspirations as they occur in real life.",1985-08-22T05:00:00+0000

The 13 photographs by Judith Ross are part of a new exhibition of the work of four young American photographers at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, that will be on display until Dec. 3. The exhibition of 40 photographs includes still lifes, technical experiments, and an autobiographical portfolio by Antonio Mendoza, a Cuban-born photographer. The other photographers represented are Zeke Berman and Michael Spano. Admission to the museum is $4.50 for adults, $3 for students, and $2 for the elderly. Weekend hours are 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. today through Sunday. Information: 708-9400.

The museum is closing this Sunday after three years of exhibitions. A new Craft Museum is scheduled to open next year at 40 West 53d Street.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AFRO-AMERICAN FOLKTALES: Stories From Black Traditions in the New World. Edited by Roger D. Abrahams. (Pantheon, Cloth, $22.95. Paper, $11.95.) In this sequel to his 1983 volume, ''African Folktales,'' Roger D. Abrahams has culled stories from American and Caribbean collections. Taken together, these tales reveal a world view marked by a gritty sense of realism. The good do not often triumph; the bad are inevitably more interesting character types. From creation myths to coded tales in which plantation masters are outwitted, the stories range across the heritage of an African past planted and tilled in the minds of slaves and their descendants. Mr. Abrahams's introduction traces the history of the tale collectors themselves, paying special tribute to Joel Chandler Harris, whose Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit tales, he concedes, had racist undertones. Nevertheless, Harris rendered the exploits of animals with human qualities in a literary style quite close to the oral traditions out of which they came. Mr. Abrahams is not romantic about how the tales changed in their passage through the years and from Africa to the New World. Praise songs, epics and long genealogical recitations did not transplant. Perhaps this accounts for the more entertaining qualities of the previous collection; the immediacy of the mother culture gave the African folk tales more vivid moments. These Afro-American stories evince a survivor's sensibility, not without humor. The ones from urban America crackle with raw emotion. I was particularly struck by ''The Signifying Monkey,'' a trickster tale cast as a long tone poem.",1985-08-25T05:00:00+0000

''Walk long enough and far enough and we were sure to come to something in the end.'' This opening line from one of the stories in this first collection expresses the sense of infinity and loss that pervades the book. Set in New Mexico, the stories, although separate, are connected by the unfulfilled lives of several characters - in particular Summerfield, whose decline is echoed in the thoughts and actions of the others. In some ways, the various characters could be one, viewed at different times and from different perspectives. They are all engaged in the same bewildered search for what they want to become, and they are all bewitched by the vast, electrifying landscape that surrounds them, holding out the promise of a life that could be nobler, freer and more beautiful than it is. ''In summer piles of clouds, fierce and sunburned, are almost always adrift there, yet never seeming to consume the vastness of the blue they drift in, making you feel that you have forever.'' The people are dwarfed by this landscape, and they wander restlessly, searching to capture its nobility and absorb it into their own lives yet always failing to ''come to something in the end.'' This small collection contains a kind of beauty I have rarely come across in fiction. It exists not so much in the language, which is occasionally clumsy, as the atmosphere the stories create.",1985-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Four of the six candidates for City Council president were also ruled off the ballot and then ordered restored.

''New Year's Eve'' concerned a group of young writers and editors in New York City who decide to have a party on a grim winter's night in the 1930's. In the opening scene, the host and one of his cronies are engaged in a bitter dispute about who should be invited to the party. ''Since both of them were intellectuals,'' Schwartz noted, ''both resorted to theories about the nature of a party and about each other's characters.'' Intellectuals? ''New Year's Eve,'' I later discovered, was a portrait of Schwartz's gang on the staff of the Partisan Review, a magazine I read avidly in college - and not just the current issues, but the heavy, maroon-bound volumes from the 30's and 40's announcing the latest article by Lionel Trilling or Edmund Wilson, a new poem by Wallace Stevens or Allen Tate, a story by Saul Bellow or Bernard Malamud. To see the work of my literary heroes in its original form, the way it had appeared before most of them were famous, was a strange experience; it made them somehow less sanctified, more real.

us,  MAGAZINE SHOWS: A TIME FOR DECISION,"Television seems to be at a watershed, and even if this is not so apparent as the ascent of Milton Berle, say, or the birth of instant replay, it is likely to have a more far-reaching effect. The issue is television journalism; specifically, what is it? On one side of the issue are traditionalists, and on the other side are the new people, who may be identified not so much by their age as by their devotion to video. Loosely speaking, the traditionalists embrace a discipline, while the new people look to a technique. How well can they blend images, words and music? Traditionalists say that's not enough, and that in journalism the story must come first. This may seem like an academic argument; it is not. It centers on what television thinks about news. Does it think it's important? The argument broke out when CBS News presented ''West 57th,'' its new magazine show, two weeks ago. If it had been presented by CBS Entertainment, there would have been no argument. ''West 57th,'' however, was a triumph for the new people. Video won; journalism lost, and traditionalists wrung their hands. Fred Friendly, a former president of CBS News, said in a newspaper interview that ''West 57th'' was a ''piece of glitz,'' while William Leonard, another former president, said that it wasn't journalism ''by any stretch of the imagination.'' CBS News, in turn, defended its new program. It was ''solid journalism,'' ''good journalism,'' ''the product of a brand new generation of TV journalists.''",1985-08-25T05:00:00+0000

But 6 errors in 14 starts, combined with a batting average of only .242, sent him first to the bench and then to Nashville, Detroit's Class AAA affiliate, where he has not exactly prospered. With the season winding down, Pittaro is batting under .200 and is only occasionally in the starting lineup, splitting time between second and third. ''We may have brought him along too quickly,'' acknowledges Frank Franchi, Detroit's director of player development. ''But we won't be influenced by his stats at Nashville. We know he can play.

Well, of course he'd known that, but all at once it took his breath away. He saw how real those lives were to the people who lived them - how intense and private and absorbing.'' It is from just such private lives that Miss Tyler herself has spun her own minutely detailed art, rendering them with such warmth and fidelity that her readers, too, are startled into a new appreciation of the ordinary and mundane. Like John Updike, she has taken as her fictional territory that sprawling American landscape of the middle class, and in 10 novels now, she has claimed as her special province the family in all its contrary dimensions.",1985-08-28T05:00:00+0000

''To bore a hole in the skull,'' the doctor says cheerfully. ''One of man's oldest operations.'' A doctor's office furnished with such an array might inspire thoughts of time warp. However, in this case the doctor, a Manhattan ophthalmologist named Stanley Burns, practices medicine according to normal modern-day standards.
