It's also clever and confident and furiously energetic, and it has the two most sadly neglected selling points any movie could want right now: it's brief (only 88 minutes), and it looks inexpensive (it cost about $3 million) without looking cheap. ''Airplane!'' is more than a pleasant surprise, in the midst of this dim movie season. As a remedy for the bloated self-importance of too many other current efforts, it's just what the doctor ordered. ",1980-07-02T05:00:00+0000

Far from diminishing the movie's forcefulness, this low-keyed approach draws the audience close. The resulting footage is as warm as it is tuneful. ",1980-07-18T05:00:00+0000

us,'HONEYSUCKLE ROSE',"THE screenplay for ''Honeysuckle Rose'' is credited to three writers, and what they have created is dialogue, not conversation. The film's four editors have put together sequences, not scenes. The direction, by Jerry Schatzberg, aims for general impressions rather than simple ones, and its only clear focus is the redoubtable Willie Nelson, who commands attention absolutely whenever he appears on screen. In Mr. Nelson's performance, and in his singing turns, the film achieves a precision in sharp contrast to the vagueness that afflicts it otherwise. ",1980-07-18T05:00:00+0000

It's ironic that just as he's being recognized as one of the great primitives of American movies, he should come out with ''The Big Red One,'' a handsome, technically first-rate, almost leisurely recollection of the World War II experiences of five American soldiers, from the landings in North Africa in 1942 until the collapse of Germany in 1945.

More than possible, it's likely. This sedate, longish Swiss film concentrates on a middle-class country household where lives are changing. The father may soon pass the farm on to his son. The daughter may begin a joyless affair with an Italian farmhand. The mother is highly responsive to everyone else's troubles. Many of these threads are woven together at mealtimes, as the family members dine in silence and exchange weighty glances. ",1980-07-20T05:00:00+0000

Here are a series of sketches and tableaux that, through dialogue, music and spectacle, have the function of a series of essays on the nature and meaning of the life of Ludwig II of Bavaria (1845-86), the mad king who is now remembered chiefly as the patron of Richard Wagner and as the fellow who built all those crazy castles on the Rhine.
