She was in the first class to attend Smithtown High School West, where she played three sports. She was in the first graduating class and was awarded the scholar athlete award and most valuable female athlete. While a student at Smithtown High School she and her dear friend, Kathy Hanlon, chaperoned dances for the Junior League for developmentally disabled citizens for three years. She also volunteered as a camp counselor at Camp Wilton in New York State. As a young woman, Jean led a group of adults and children who, for several years, sang in the local nursing home during the holidays. She also brought out children from the city to spend ''weekends in the country'' at Smithtown. Jean travelled extensively visiting Africa twice to view the natural beauty and the wildlife. She was greatly concerned about the environment and found her joy in the outdoors camping, kayaking, and bicycling. As an adult, Jean completed four triathalons and although girls could not play soccer when she attended high school, she did manage, as a woman, to join the Bergen Kickers and later to play with Leitrim's team in the upper Bronx. Jean attended Stony Brook University graduating in 1980 from an accelerated program and earning a B.A. in political science and an M.S. in Urban Policy Sciences. In 1981 she completed an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Jean was initiated into Pi Sigma Alpha, the national Political Science honor society. Jean joined the Port Authority in April 1982. In December '83 she was assigned to the Fire Safety Section. In '85 she was elected into the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. She advanced through the P.A. and was presently the Operations Manager for Risk Management in the Treasury Dept. Jean was the kind of aunt every kid wished for. She loved her nephews dearly and certainly did dote on them. They are George and Michael Andrucki and Michael Devlin Izzo. We truly looked forward to her weekends at home in her beloved Smithtown; she never really became a full fledged ''city girl.'' We, her family, will grieve endlessly for her. Our lives and the lives of all her many friends will never be the same with the loss of her beautiful spirit and her compassionate, loving heart. The world will be a poorer place having lost this gentle and kind woman. Services for Jean will be held in Hoboken at Frank Sinatra park on Friday, October 5 at 6 P.M. and in Smithtown, St. Patricks Church, Main Street, 10:30 mass on October 11.

The company is expected to provide details of the deal, which would still require regulatory approval as well as the blessing of labor unions, during a news conference this morning at its headquarters in Leverkusen. For Bayer, which has struggled after the withdrawal of its cholesterol-lowering drug known as Lipobay or Baycol, the purchase of CropScience, the Aventis unit, would be a big step forward in expanding its agrochemicals operations. In swallowing CropScience, the third-largest player in the $33 billion agrochemicals industry, Bayer would jump from sixth to second, behind the industry leader Syngenta, analysts said. Aventis, the French-German conglomerate, has been eager to sell CropScience, which is 24 percent owned by Schering, a German rival, to concentrate on its pharmaceuticals business.

As a firefighter for 13 years, Edward (Eddy) Day, 45, loved his job as a member of Engine Company 28 and Ladder 11 on Manhattan's Lower East Side. He transferred there in 1989 after having been posted briefly at Engine Company 4, also in Lower Manhattan. The members of both firehouses knew him as a fun loving friend to all. Including Eddy, six members of Ladder 11 are missing as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center. Eddy was a life-long resident of Staten Island who enjoyed participating in many sporting activities. He was a thirddegree black belt in karate and enjoyed teaching children the discipline and respect associated with karate. He was an accomplished runner who ran in the NYC marathon several times. He was an avid golfer who enjoyed taking trips to Myrtle Beach, SC, with his golfing buddies. Eddy was very proud to have learned to swim at the age of 40. He attended St. John the Baptist de la Salle grammar school, Curtis High School, and Staten Island Community College. His love of the outdoors and nature held a large place in his heart. This love extended towards various animals that he and his wife cared for in their home: a dog, several cats, three snakes and a rabbit. He and Bridgitte (Gitta), his wife of 20 years, and the same group of friends always vacationed at least one week per year in the Adirondacks Mountains of upstate New York. ''His eyes would light up when he talked about vacationing at Pecks Lake,'' said his long time friend Margaret Duffy-Shanley. He had an appetite for learning new things. If a topic interested him, he would simply read a book on the subject and then do it. He enjoyed troubleshooting computers, he re-built his garage and added a deck and a new roof onto his house. He was a self-taught auto and motorcycle mechanic as well. He learned German so that he would be able to communicate with his wife's family. He very much enjoyed visiting Germany and spending time with his family and friends there who miss him dearly. ''He was my life,'' said his wife. Known for his love of fun and friends, Eddy enjoyed relaxing with the occasional beer and schnapps. ''He was always the life of the party, usually laughing the hardest at his own jokes,'' said his mother, Grace Day. The memorial service for Edward Day will be held on Saturday, October 6, 2001, at 2:00 PM on Staten Island at the Music Hall at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.

Mr. Breen, left, previously was head of Motorola's networks sector. He was chairman and chief executive of the General Instrument Corporation, which merged with Motorola in January 2000. The move was not unexpected on Wall Street. Mr. Growney, who underwent heart bypass surgery in May 2000, had announced his intention to retire in 2002, after more than 36 years with the company. He will become vice chairman until he retires on March 31, 2002. Mr. Breen has generally received praise for his energetic and no-nonsense management of the company's broadband-cable and network units. Shares in Motorola rose 12 cents, to $15.35.

Uner his leadership, the Yale Child Center became the gold standard for excellence in research, teaching and service. He made the connections between biology, psychoanalysis, and child development understandable and useful. In addition to his pioneering efforts in biological research of Autism and Tourette's syndrome, he was a training analyst and an expert in the development of social interaction in children. He was a founding father in the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has become a widely used paradigm for conceptualizing psychological well-being and impairment in children. He was at once a true visionary and practical efficient clinician. Using his talents and interest, he impacted the field of child development in everlasting ways worldwide. His singular influence will continue to be transmitted by his pupils in Korea, Turkey, many parts of the former Soviet Union, China and Brazil. He was a forceful, passionate social advocate for children's rights. Undoubtedly, his manifold achievements will be recounted again and again in the tributes paid to him. We, however, will be eternally grateful for two of his great loves: his Jewish heritage and Israel and mentoring the careers of promising young students. A major crystallization of these two passions stands now as the Feinberg Child Study Center at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel,...the culmination of over two decades of support and inspiration of young clinicians and his multifaceted approach to understanding children. Together with Dr. Alan Apter, Dr. Itamar Shalit, of Israel, and with the encouragement of Mr. Irving Schneider and the Feinberg family, he conceived the development of a center of excellence in Israel. Its mission is to enhance and serve the welfare of children in Israel as well as the entire troubled region. Our work has just begun. It will be an uphill task without Donald's leadership, but his everlasting inspiration will make the Feinberg Child Study Center a true legacy to this great physician.

He was a giant in this city-an extraordinarily successful businessman, a model philanthropist, a statesman concerned about the well-being of the city, and a caring humanist who dedicated himself to helping to provide the highest quality of health care for all the citizens of New York. Truly one of a kind, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of The Presbyterian Hospital in the City of New York beginning in 1988, and served as Chairman from 1989 to 1996. In 1989, he and his family gave the Hospital the single largest donation in its history. The Milstein Hospital Building was named in their honor. During his Chairmanship, The Presbyterian Hospital achieved financial stability, modernized its infrastructure, improved its community outreach, maintained its leadership in research and clinical care, and recruited distinguished clinicians and administrators.

The belief among those who use this relatively unfamiliar method (including Tom Colicchio , the chef from Craft and Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan) is that blanching the leaves will preserve the pesto longer (refrigerated) than if raw leaves are used.

But Percival Everett's new novel, ERASURE (University Press of New England, $24.95), cunningly pokes fun at such lofty sentiment. With equal measures of sympathy and satire, it craftily addresses the highly charged issue of being ''black enough'' in America. Meet Thelonious Ellison, a k a Monk, an extremely intellectual yet not very successful avant-garde writer who has recently returned to Washington to care for his ailing mother. While there, sifting through the detritus of his family drama, Monk finds himself obsessed with the overwhelming success of another African-American writer's best seller, ''We's Lives in da Ghetto.'' He is appalled that the novel's young, middle-class, Oberlin-educated author based her book's so-called authentic urban experience on a couple of days spent visiting relatives in Harlem. In a fit of pique, Monk fires off a parody entitled ''My Pafology.'' (That book is printed in its entirety here.) Raw and scathing, a suburban teenager's gangsta fantasy brought to life, it tells the story of Van Go Jenkins, a hard-as-nails narrator steeped in the anger and futility of his inner-city life. The rub, of course, is that the novel, written under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh, also becomes a critical and commercial success. What, then, is a self-respecting writer to do? Accept the six-figure advance and multimillion-dollar movie deal? It is only thanks to Everett's well-calibrated and witty handling of this material that Monk manages to think his way through such a sticky situation. Jenifer Berman",2001-10-07T05:00:00+0000

We asked them to conceive a memorial for the towers, and when they came back with their proposal, ''Phantom Towers,'' we were struck by its haunting beauty and knew immediately that it should be our cover image. It has now also helped inspire a movement to make the memorial a reality. LaVerdiere and Myoda have joined forces with the architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi, who had independently arrived at a similar notion, and together they have produced another image, called ''Towers of Light'' (shown below). Under the auspices of the arts group Creative Time, the idea has gained official support. The mayor's office has become involved, and research into lighting techniques is proceeding apace. The final form may not be known for sure until the moment it lights up the skyline. ''It's an impulse many people shared, and there's no one right way to do it,'' says LaVerdiere.

Cohen, Director of the Yale Child Studies Center. A true visionary, for over three decades Dr. Cohen steadfastly initiated and supported countless creative programs and activities designed to improve treatments and spur research into Tourette Syndrome throughout the world. His contributions to an improved understanding of TS treatment and the remarkable progress seen in scientific research have been seminal. For more than a quarter century, Donald mentored hundreds of physicians and researchers in the United States and in many foreign countries.

If you want barbecue, though, the Mason Jar is worth the trip to Mahwah. The Mason Jar is well north of the Mason-Dixon Line, but specializes in Southern-style hickory pit barbecue. The distinctive aroma of slow-cooked meat hits you in the parking lot. Or, if you've got a stuffed nose, you'll probably notice the giant pile of firewood out back. This is no ramshackle roadhouse, however. The Mason Jar is a large, pleasant family restaurant. You know the drill: wood paneling, hanging plants, ceiling fans. The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Employees must pass a 30-question quiz on menu item, sort of a BBQSAT. That's no easy task, for in addition to the Jar-B-Que items, the Mason Jar also offers brick-oven pizza, sushi and a Sunday brunch buffet ($18.95 for adults). I came for the meat. The combination platter ($11.95, including two sides and corn bread) allowed me to sample Texas beef brisket, Carolina pulled pork, and boneless pork loin, all tender and tasty. I slathered the meat in the Mason Jar's two homemade sauces: a thicker, tangy tomato-based variety, and a ''wet'' spicy style. Sandwiches, chicken and half-racks of Memphis spareribs ($9.95) and Kansas City baby backs ($11.95) complete the barbecue selections. Ah, yes, the name. My Coke came in a Mason jar. That made sense. The bill also arrived in a Mason Jar. That made less sense. At that point, though, I was too full to worry about it. Jack Silbert",2001-10-07T05:00:00+0000

The great unanswered question is whether the contamination was the work of terrorists, or a crime of some sort, or has a more benign natural explanation.",2001-10-09T05:00:00+0000

The most notable change is an extension of the customer deadline for upgrading to the program, called Software Assurance. Customers now have until July 31, 2002, rather than Feb. 28, 2002, to become ''current'' on Microsoft Windows, Office and other Microsoft software titles they use, a requirement for participation in Software Assurance. At the same time, Microsoft said customers running Office 2000 would not be forced to upgrade to the new Office XP to be eligible. Microsoft has faced a chorus of complaints since it announced the upgrade program in May 2001, mainly from corporate customers buying software in volume, who say the licensing program will sharply increase their upgrade costs. Microsoft, which views the new program as an important step toward its model of offering software as a service rather than a product, estimates that only 20 percent of customers will have a cost increase.

us,World Briefing | The Africa: Somalia: Protest Over Shaky Currency,"Thousands of Somalis staged a violent demonstration in Mogadishu demanding that business owners and money dealers accept 500-shilling notes, which are worth about two cents. With the Somali shilling at an all-time low -- 2,620 to the dollar -- many merchants turn away the notes because they are worth so little. Likewise, money changers demand 30,000 shillings to the dollar for those with 500-shilling notes, well above the 20,500 rate offered on the street. To protest the practices, demonstrators burned trash and tires, looted street vendors' stalls and smashed car windows. President Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, who heads Somalia's one-year-old transitional government, called for calm over the radio. Somalia lacks a central bank, so businessmen and faction leaders have been paying to have bills printed in Canada and Southeast Asia and then shipped to Somalia, where they can control the supply.

Procter & Gamble shareholders will own 53 percent of Smucker after the transaction is completed, the companies said. Adding the No. 1 peanut butter and shortening in the United States will increase Smucker's sales to about $1.3 billion a year, Smucker said. Procter & Gamble is selling the brands as part of a plan to reduce the number of products it carries to focus on faster-growing cosmetics and health care lines, including Cover Girl makeup. Procter & Gamble is spinning off Jif and Crisco first rather than selling them outright to take advantage of tax laws that allow it to avoid paying capital gains taxes on the sale.",2001-10-11T05:00:00+0000

The central bank kept its baseline interest rate at 3.75 percent, refusing to add to the emergency rate cut it made nearly two weeks ago. In holding rates steady, the European central bankers again diverged from the course of the United States Federal Reserve, which cut rates repeatedly before and after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Analysts said the European bank might be waiting for more signs of the fallout from Sept. 11, and they speculated that the bank had been put off by hints of strengthening growth in the last few days. But most experts still say European rates will be cut at least one more time before the year's end. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)",2001-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Afghanistan Can Learn From Its Past,"The people of Afghanistan, after a century of misrule, are in desperate need of a way to govern themselves that will offer some defense against the abuses of power that have marked Afghan history. Now that President Bush has acknowledged the need to help build a stable government in Afghanistan, perhaps under leadership of the United Nations, many are asking: Who should rule? Once the Taliban are defeated, several parties want to rule: the ex-king, Muhammad Zahir Shah; the Pashtun ethnic group; the opposition Northern Alliance; and of course the Taliban.

Sections devoted to the history of blues, country, gospel, folk, Cajun and zydeco, Tex-Mex and Native American sounds are followed by brief mini-biographies of a handful of key figures in the evolution of these vernacular American musical forms. The abundant illustrations, many in full color, are often familiar but still suggestive. The book's best moments evoke the larger cultural transformations of America during the last century, as the nation became a postmodern society struggling toward integration and hit by tidal waves of information. The folk revival, for instance, as Alan Jabbour points out in his fine essay, may have peaked in the 1960's but was made possible much earlier by factors like the ''surge of social and cultural activism during the New Deal era.'' These days, when the forgotten, far-flung musical shards for which collectors once trawled through attics and cellars are easily available on compact disc, a primer like ''American Roots Music'' may be more useful than ever. Though at times it lapses into dry musicology or repetitive superficiality, at its best ''American Roots Music'' offers a textured and expert guide to America's many musical subcultures.

Schweetz, the candy store in F. A. O. Schwarz, are opening Dylan's Candy Bar, a 5,500-square-foot sugar-coated emporium. It's a way to showcase the elegance of candy in a museumlike setting, said Mr. Rubin, who met Ms. Lauren through mutual friends. Located at 60th Street and Third Avenue, the sweet factory is a mix of art, fashion and candy, and the home of what the two say is the world's largest lollipop (44 inches tall), $5,000 collector's Pez dispensers, every type of Hasbro spin pop ever created and 21 exclusive colors of M&M's, as well as M&M cameras, desk lamps and karaoke machines. The shop itself, a duplex, is as colorful as the confectionary delights inside. Stairs are made of resin and embedded with all sorts of gummies. (Gummies are beautiful when you hold them up to the light, Ms. Lauren said.) A mountain of oversize Jelly Belly beans rises from the bottom floor to the main floor. An enormous lollipop sculpture is on the main floor, as is the cafe bar, which features candy-cane-inspired bar stools. A candy gallery doubles as a private party room. Television monitors throughout the store show old-school candy commercials (''Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't'').

The death of her father forced her to leave school at 14 to support her mother and 3 brothers, continuing to sustain them all throughout their lives. She had a beautiful voice and sang in the choir of Temple Beth-El in Bradley Beach, NJ. In the 1940's she had three high fashion stores in Miami Beach, FL. carrying haute couture in sportswear and evening clothes. In 1947 she was lauded by Women's Wear Daily as The Small Business Woman of the Year. After Mr. Cherry's death she closed the stores and opened a Barton's candy store in what is now the Bal Harbor shops in Miami Beach, FL. In the 1970's she went to work for a fledgling bridal designer in NYC & built the business from nothing to success. After working 5-1/2 days a week for 26 years she ended her career at the age of 85 when she decided that Alzheimer's disease was robbing her of the things she needed to work: memory & spatial logistics. She was a paragon, the epitome of everything generous and gracious, giving of herself unstintingly to anyone who crossed her path. She graced our lives with compassion, strength and boundless love.

us,'Aquagenesis'," There may be a place on Earth&#151;albeit somewhat inaccessible&#151;where we might be able to see conditions not unlike those that the earliest life forms saw. Where the sea floor pulls apart (a phenomenon known as &quot;sea-floor spreading&quot;), cracks or rifts are created in the crust of the Earth. This activity usually, but not always, takes place along the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile-long undersea series of mountain ranges that snakes around the planet like the seams of a baseball, and is the largest single geological feature on the Earth's surface. The rifts mark the edges of the lithospheric plates, which bear the continents in their inexorable movement on the first 100 to 250 kilometers of the surface of the planet. The plates such as those of North America and Africa drift over the less rigid athenosphere, much like giant icebergs in the ocean. The formation of the plates occurs at the mid-ocean ridge, and they are consumed at &quot;subduction trenches,&quot; where one plate slides under the lip of another. Where plates interact, earthquakes occur, volcanoes erupt, and mountains are pushed up. All three were manifest in November 1963, when the Icelandic island of Surtsey was born in a spectacular cataclysm of fire, lava, and steam. The rifts caused by the separation of the plates fill up with lava that wells up from within the earth, flowing outward from the center and moving across the ocean floor. As described by J. R. Heirtzler and W. B. Bryan (1975), &quot;Bizarre as the idea seemed at first, it was becoming evident that the mid-ocean-ridge system was nothing less than a vast unhealed volcanic wound.&quot; ",2001-10-14T05:00:00+0000

I love her nose-in-the-air self-satisfaction when a scheme is going right, her open-mouthed double take of disbelief when it's not, her curled-lip, scrunched-nose ''Yeeeuww!'' when she's finally caught. I love how Lucy always drags her doubting, dumpy neighbor Ethel Mertz along for the ride as part handmaid, part henchman.

us,QUICK BITE/Princeton; Thin Crust Worth a Long Walk,"Hungry and pressed for time on a beautiful fall day, I walked into the local pizza place near my office in the heart of Princeton. Then I left. The heavy smell of dough and cheese warned me that the fare was going to be as uninspired as the multitone Formica tables and benches. My feet took orders from my taste buds: ''Forget your deadline. Go to Old World Pizza.'' So I made the five-block walk to a storefront spot that has a fresher, lighter, more appetizing scent. The Old World crust -- thin and crunchy with a perfect balance of breadiness -- is wonderful support for a light, slightly peppery sauce and thin squares of fresh mozzarella. No heavy, sliding sheets of cheese here. The restaurant offers a variety of add-ons. I prefer to top it off with paper-thin slices of Old World's store-made sausage. Sometimes I pull a stool up to the paper-plate-deep counter, but mostly I eat on the walk back to my office. With less mass than some pizza, Old World slices tend to cool quickly, so there's no need for disciplined waiting for the first bite. And a warning: perhaps more than other pizza, Old World's thin crust suffers from even a few minutes of being boxed up in cardboard on the passenger seat of a car. So if you're ordering it to take home, be sure to be there to pick it up as they are sliding it into the box. But really, who needs to put pizza on a table?

But bats do live in the attic of the 1761 John Brearley House in Lawrenceville, a farmhouse restored by the township, whether people want them to or not. There have been several attempts to relocate the Brearley House bats to other places, but ''they keep finding ways to return to that attic,'' said Rick Dutko a zoologist with the state Deparment of Environmental Protection. They stream out at dusk, and visitors will probably see them starting around 4 p.m. Friday when it is ''Bat Night at the Brearley House.'' Mr. Dutko will be on hand for the family event, rain or shine. He will tell what bats are really like and will do so with a bat or two from the attic on his arm. The cost is $2 a person or $10 a family; reservations, (609) 895-1728. The Brearley House is at the end of Meadow Road off of Princeton Pike, beside the Princessville Cemetery.

There is broad support for this effort within different branches of government, across the political spectrum, and among the American public. The commitment to the fight against terrorism, which is often spoken of as a &#147;war,&#148; is reflected in the statements of national leaders about the persistence and fortitude that the fight will require. President Bill Clinton stated in 1998 that the United States was in &#147;a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and fanaticism, between the rule of law and terrorism.&#148; 1 The president later told the United Nations General Assembly that &#147;terrorism is at the top of the American agenda&#151;and should be at the top of the world agenda.&#148; 2 The breadth of the commitment has been reflected in the resources provided to counter-terrorism, including two supplemental appropriations for that purpose during the past five years.

James was last spoken to at work on the morning of September 11th. He was a lifelong resident of Staten Island, NY, where he attended Saint Adalbert's and Moore Catholic High School. An accomplished athlete, he lettered four years and was captain of the baseball and basketball teams. He earned a baseball scholarship to North Adams State College, Massachusetts, where he played for four years in his best known position as catcher. He graduated in 1982 and was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. James Ladley returned home to Staten Island where his love for baseball resumed with the TWYFord Muche Leagues. At the same time, he pursued his interests in Finance and Economics, which ultimately led him to a successful career. James P. Ladley began his career on Wall Street 17 years ago. He started as an assistant broker at Fundamental Brokerage, Inc. James spent many evenings entertaining clients and built strong business relationships as well as friendships along the way. He moved to Chapdelaine Corporate Securities, became a Partner and held a position within the corporate bond division. James continued his successes as he accepted a new position at Cantor Fitzgerald. For over six years he enjoyed working for the firm as a Partner and as a corporate bond broker, one of the top producers for the firm. James won the respect and admiration of his many friends and co-workers. He expected a lot from himself and out of life. He had a tremendous work ethic and a rigorous schedule that began at 5 AM and ended at 7 PM: it was just a day's work. James P. Ladley also loved the recreational game of golf. He truly enjoyed the friendships and the beauty it offered. These past few years on any given Saturday, he could be found on the Green at the Colts Neck Golf Club. He was the first club member to achieve a ''hole in one'' on the 10th. Settling in Colts Neck 11 years ago, he took great pride in being an active member of his community. James contributed throughout his life to many charities, funds and organizations. Being a New Yorker and having such great appreciation for athletics, he became a die hard Yankees and Rangers fan. He liked going to restaurants, concerts, shows and most of all, he enjoyed coming home to his family, to a nice meal and watching a ball game. James' motivation in life was the love for his family, instilled by his loving parents James and Dolores and siblings MaryAnn, Eileen, Daniel and Patrick. He was a respectful, caring son, and being the oldest, he was the perfect example of a big brother. He always took pride in himself and the importance of always trying to do what was right. James Ladley was loved by all who knew him, especially his family. Jim was a terrific husband and dedicated father, and was cherished by his wife, Sheri, and their two young children, Elizabeth and James. He is the heart and soul of a secure and loving home. Jim, Jimmy, Daddy and Uncle Jimmy will always remain in our hearts and will be missed deeply.

An author and educator with a special interest in children's play, sends her last adieux to the many relatives, friends, and colleagues who loved and admired her and to the much larger number of children who profited from her efforts on their behalf. Erma was discovered to have multiple myeloma in July 2001. She died of it on October 15th. Her long life was vibrant and full. A born story teller, she was author of ''A New Baby, A New Life!'' (Christopher Award, 1973), numerous children's stories, and a fictionalized memoir called ''Echoes.'' The crowning achievement of her later years was a children's program called ''Small House,'' a play program for children of elementary school age that served two functions. It brought joy into the lives of the children for whom it was designed and it was a highly successful means of crisis prevention for many children who were emotionally disturbed by current events in their lives. In April 2001 the Parent/Child Center of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute arranged a special meeting for the presentation and discussion of the ''Small House'' program. The meeting was largely attended and enthusiastically received. In addition, an ''Erma Brenner'' prize award was established by a generous friend and admirer for the best paper on children's play. At Erma's request there will be neither funeral nor a memorial meeting to celebrate her accomplishments. She said, ''I don't need a memorial meeting. The April meeting was the best tribute to my work that I could have wished for, and I was there to enjoy it as well.'' Those who wish may contribute to the Parent/Child Center of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, 247 East 82nd Street, New York, New York 10028.

If the doctor who heard them and, astonished, wrote them down, made no mistake, then we're left with a riddle, for in life Haussmann seemed incapable of regret. Regret is a backward-turning emotion, and the Baron was famous for straightforwardness; he made the boulevards and razed the crooked lanes where tanners' sheds fronted cracked courtyards and sewer ditches spilled over into the bins of wire and paper petals of the artificial-flower makers for which the city, before his arrival on the scene, was famous. To Haussmann's German name and the sense of order which, we can only assume, came with it, we owe the sidewalk caf&#233;s with their six tiers of wicker chairs, the public urinals and Morris columns for theatrical advertisements, the insane asylum of Sainte-Anne and the park at Boulogne; to him we owe the rows of plane trees which in summer catch dust and sunlight in their leaves, and the pastime of strolling that caught on as the sidewalk widened into the twentieth century. Stop a moment on the avenue Foch, one afternoon, and thank Haussmann; stop again on the boulevard Raspail on your way home, weigh the oblong package of dates tucked under your arm, and wonder why the Baron, having made all this, wished it undone? Was it selfishness? Or as death approached did he see for the first time that the Emperor had been wrong, the speculators had been wrong, the engineers had been wrong, he had been wrong&#151;did he see that, in all his work, there was something to regret?

us,Jihad's Women,"In some of the larger cities in Pakistan, like Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, many women work, go to the movies, eat at McDonald's, wear pants and otherwise live a modern, Western-influenced life. But in certain areas, particularly in the Northwest Frontier Province, which abuts Afghanistan, many girls and young women spend much of their time in one of the more than 100 religious schools, or madrassahs, for women. (There are about 10,000 madrassahs for boys and men throughout Pakistan.) Here they are steeped in Islamic fundamentalism -- reading and reciting the Koran many hours a day and learning Arabic grammar and pronunciation. At some of these madrassahs, like Jamia Khadijatul-Kubra-Lil-Binat, immersion is complete; students, who tend to come from poor or lower-middle-class families, board during the week and leave only on weekends to visit their homes. These madrassahs instill a religious ideology that is at the heart of the jihad now being waged against the United States.",2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Alone of All Her Kind,"Elena Michaels, the 30-year-old narrator of Kelley Armstrong's frisky first novel, BITTEN (Viking, $24.95), is a journalist with a devoted boyfriend and a dark secret: a decade earlier, she was bitten by a werewolf and survived, a rare feat that makes her ''the only female werewolf in existence.'' Every few weeks, preferably when her clueless boyfriend is out of town, she sprouts fur and claws and takes a furtive nocturnal run through the streets of Toronto. Passing in human society means disguising her ravenous appetite by devouring sausages and hunks of cheese on the sly and pretending to be demure and physically weak. And Elena is determined to pass. She spent much of her 20's living with a small community of civilized werewolves (known as ''the Pack'') in upstate New York, but has decided to break from her past because she can't give up her ''ordinary, mediocre dreams of a home, a family, a career and, above all, stability. None of that was possible living as a werewolf.'' The novel tells the story of what happens when Elena is summoned to help the Pack defend itself against a band of lawless werewolves (they're called ''mutts''), including several serial killers handpicked and recruited from the human population. (These newly-bitten werewolves are particularly savage.) The plot is that of a thriller, and it's a little shaky: there are too many villains and they are cartoonishly sinister. But the novel also tells a rather sweet love story, and suggests that being a wolf may be more comfortable for a strong, smart young woman than being a human. Jennifer Reese",2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Hope failed to become economically self-sufficient and church officials decided to end the venture. In 1808 the settlers held their last service before packing up, leaving behind a gristmill, a distillery, a meetinghouse and other buildings.

Members of the middle class in that era, made rich through trade and manufacturing, admired the plain-spoken and wanted to see their everyday lives recorded in paint. Contemporary viewers get pleasure from these paintings, not only because they are a look at how life was lived, but also because they show how art can transcend the ordinary while faithfully recording it.

While I felt the same way about the inauguration, I was taken aback by Gordis's assertion that this is to be expected because ''the U.S. . . . is simply a Christian country.'' It has always seemed to me that what distinguishes this country is not -- or not only -- its commitment to freedom: after all, there are many democratic nations that value freedom highly. Rather, it is our intentional diversity, our promise of liberty and justice for all. This is a promise that we have not always made good on, but to abandon it is to abandon what is best about the United States. Surely it is not an accident that in the days following the Sept. 11 attack many of the photos published in newspapers and magazines showed the still-standing Statue of Liberty, symbol of welcome to people of all cultures and creeds.",2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000

John Speed, tailor-turned map-maker and historian, must have had some idea, for in 1611 he published an atlas of sixty-seven maps of the English counties, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, loftily entitled The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine . An energetic opportunist, Speed was taking advantage of King James's widely advertised desire to be known, not as the Sixth of Scotland and First of England, but as monarch of Britain. The fancy of a British history had been given fresh authority by William Camden's great compilation of geography, the antiquarian chronicle, Britannia, already in its sixth edition by 1607. On its frontispiece sat the helmeted personification of the island nation, flanked by Neptune and Ceres, together with an emblem of British antiquity &#151; Stonehenge &#151; thought to have been built by the Romano-British hero Aurelius.

But in North Jersey it is a huge sandwich, which serves at least three, made with a variety of meats on three layers of thinly sliced rye, bound with Russian dressing and laced with cole slaw. These sandwiches are said to have originated at Town Hall Delicatessen in South Orange, and their highest expression is found there. There is nary a kreplach nor a blintz at Town Hall for it is an old-fashioned German deli, one that sells chicken  la king, macaroni and cheese and rice pudding topped with meringue. But the best reason to visit is the sloppy Joe. The most common sloppy (as they are known) is turkey and roast beef ($15.65), but they are made in any requested combination, which could also include tonque and corned beef, all made in the deli's kitchen. Another version is made with smoked salmon, creamed cheese and egg salad ($15.25). Town Hall has been making sloppies since the 1930's, according to one of its owners, Jack Burdorf, when a Maplewood politico, Thomas Sweeney, returned from a vacation in Cuba. There he spent time at a bar named Sloppy Joe's where the owner laid out fixings and patrons put sandwiches together. Mr. Sweeney asked Town Hall to cater his poker games with the same sort of sandwiches, and they caught on. Mr. Burdorf and his partner, Ron Joost, have put Town Hall on the market. They are hopeful that a new owner will keep on making sloppies, but you might not wait too long before ordering a sloppy for that poker game.",2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Close Reader; At War With the World,"Anyone who doubts that literary critics can play a part on the bloody stage of history should consider the example of Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, born in Egypt in 1906 and university educated, was a Western-style literary critic until he devoted himself to Islam after spending two years in the United States exposed to what he viewed as our decadence. He died in 1966, when he was hanged along with other Muslim radicals by the government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qutb's books of hard-line political theology have had a direct influence on the Saudi Arabian Muslim opposition; the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria; the Palestinian group Hamas; the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon; Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric jailed for several thwarted terrorist plots and linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and the Iranian writer Ali Shariati, who helped foster the Islamic revolution in Iran.",2001-10-21T05:00:00+0000

His quiet support of many causes and activities in the Town of Ridgefield, which he loved so well, has improved the life of its citizens. His spirit of adventure, keen intelligence, serene confidence, and sly humor will be deeply missed by us all.

us,Naked Under the Gold,"The protracted embraces of Gustav Klimt's dreamy figures and the opulent golden mosaics that adorn them have made him a popular favorite. But critics in his lifetime and scholars since have not always known what to do with him, as Colin B. Bailey, chief curator at the Frick Collection, explains in the vivid and substantial GUSTAV KLIMT: MODERNISM IN THE MAKING (Abrams/ National Gallery of Canada, $60). Born in 1862, Klimt, the son of a poor goldsmith, trained at Vienna's commercially oriented School of Applied Arts, where he learned how to integrate metalworking techniques with painting. Bailey emphasizes the importance of Klimt's often disregarded public commissions, particularly ''Philosophy,'' a mural at the University of Vienna that portrays the human condition as a chain of naked bodies entangled in ''the endless cycle of birth, procreation and death'' (this city was, after all, home also to Freud, Klimt's contemporary). The mural's pessimism and blatant sexuality caused an uproar in 1900, when it was first exhibited, and the scandal haunted Klimt until his death in 1918. In a bit of bravura scholarship, Bailey links Klimt's wounded retreat from public projects with the development of the dazzling patterns that he used to embellish -- and protect -- his human figures. These are literally cloaks -- there are fully realized nudes underneath, as we can see in one unfinished composition of a woman with spread-eagled legs, which Klimt had just begun to ornament. When viewed this way, Klimt's abstraction, derided by critics as too superficial, decorative and out of step with the avant-garde, seems loaded with psychological and erotic content. Hilarie M.

This is the high-tech briefing area where the show's main character, President Josiah Bartlet, huddles with the military brass when make-believe blips on the radar grow alarming. In the conspicuously insider patois of the show, the space is called ''the Sit Room,'' and this is roughly the Situation: for the last two years, ''West Wing'' has become one of the most popular shows in America because, among other things, Sorkin has been able to give his kinder, gentler, nobler White House enough verisimilitude to seem tantalizingly possible. ''The only reason it's not 'Touched by an Angel,''' Sorkin says, ''is that it imitates just enough the sounds and appearance of reality. And the way I do it is by saying words you don't normally hear on television shows, like 'Democrat' and 'Republican,' and having the place look real and the hardware look real and abbreviations be right.

Richard Nicholas Daniel, the former chairman and CEO of Handy & Harman, one of the world's foremost manufacturers of precious metals, and a 30-year resident of Briarcliff Manor, New York, and New York City, died on Thursday at Sleepy Hollow Country Club on the 6th hole after shooting a perfect game, of a heart attack. He was 66. Mr. Daniel retired from Handy & Harman in 1998 after 27 years. Known for his people oriented management style during his leadership, Handy & Harman became a highly respected multi-national diversified industrial manufacturing company. Prior positions included vice president of operations at Wheelabrator-Frye, vice president of finance at Laird Enterprises, Inc., and planning associate at Mobile Corporation. For the last several years Mr. Daniel worked in merchant banking and sat on various boards, including Keyspan Corporation Gabelli Funds. Mr. Daniel was a 1957 graduate of St. John's University and Wharton Business School in 1959. He was a member of Deepdale Country Club in Manhasset, Blindbrook Country Club in Ryebrook, and a past president of the Sky Club of New York City. Mr. Daniel was an inspiring individual who put his family, his friends and his work before himself. He always joked of going from ''Who's Who'' to ''Who's He?'' To friends, he was Dick; to the poker group, he was ''killer,'' and to all, he was an amazingly selfless man. Mr. Daniel is survived by his wife Elaine Sherman Daniel, his sons Matthew Daniel of Philadelphia and Jeffrey Daniel of Washington, DC, and his sister, Linda Llewellyn of Aiken, SC. Visiting hours will be held at Waterbury and Kelly Funeral Home in Briarcliff Manor, NY, on Sunday, October 28, from 2-4 PM and 7-9 PM.

The holiday is observed at family dinners at which the favorite food and drink of the departed are served and the table is set with ornaments mocking death like dancing papier-mch skeletons and breads in the shape of little people called muecos. Muecos are for sale now at Gaby's Bakery in New Brunswick, which also bakes ojaldres, round breads with sesame seed crosses on them, which are also traditional for the Day of The Dead and are also called pan de muertos. Both breads -- made of cinnamon, eggs, sugar, flour and sesame -- come in two sizes, the ojaldres 8 inches ($1.50) and 16 inches across ($4) and the muecos 4 and 16 inches tall, also $1.50 and $4. Gaby's owner, Gabriel Roman, who grew up in Mexico City, says the breads are handmade, and he is selling them again this year -- beginning thi8s weekend until Friday. ''People make a table at home, and on the table they put gifts for the dead, food, fruits, rice pudding -- if the dead maybe liked tequila, a shot of that -- beer and sweet drinks like hot chocolate,'' he said. ''The table is set with candles and marigolds in a half-circle, and we hang the little muecos on the marigolds.'' Mr. Roman likes to wash down his Day of the Dead breads with a cup of coffee of hot chocolate. If the souls of the dead don't want to travel, Mr. Roman said, Mexican families will deliver: it is also a tradition to go visit the grave sites of loved ones and leave food there.",2001-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DANNHEISSER, ELAINE (MRS. WERNER H.)","DANNHEISSER - Elaine (Mrs. Werner H.). The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art, along with the members of its International Council, join the art world in mourning the loss of Elaine Dannheisser. Elaine had served as a Trustee of the Museum since 1995, a member of its Committee on Painting and Sculpture since 1990, a member of its Committee on Photography since 1996, and a member of its International Council since 1991. However, these positions do not begin to convey the many ways in which she permanently influenced the Museum's collection, as well as the way in which we experience and study contemporary art. Just four years ago, we celebrated the opening of On the Edge: Contemporary Art from the Werner and Elaine Dannheisser Collection at the Museum. The works of art that entered the Museum's collection on this occasion were as crucial to the collection as the bequest that came to us from one of the Museum's founders, Lillie P. Bliss, whose gift was the basis of our permanent collection and included many works that continue to be most closely associated with the Museum. Our founding Director, Alfred Barr, believed that the Museum's collection should evolve ''as a torpedo moving through time,'' and Elaine's gift enabled it to do just that. Future generations will identify this Museum with works from the Dannheisser collection, such as those by Matthew Barney, Joseph Beuys, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Jeff Koons, Brice Marden, Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke, Robert Ryman, Richard Serra, and Cindy Sherman, just as current ones identify it with Water Lilies, The Starry Night, and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Beginning as a girl from Brooklyn whose mother brought her to the Museum to see Guernica, Elaine has now taken her place alongside such benefactors as Mrs. Simon Guggenheim, Harriet and Sidney Janis, Philip Johnson, William S. Paley, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Louise Reinhardt Smith, and Gordon Bunshaft. Elaine was a consummate collector (acquiring new work right up until the very end), but was also the most insightful benefactress. Over the years, Elaine formed a collection that was deeply personal and distinctly her own. When she decided to give it to the Modern, however, she was doubly generous: in addition to making a monumental gift, she allowed the Museum to accept the works that were needed to build a balanced collection. In some cases, she helped augment existing areas of the collection that were missing key pieces. In others, she gave us the collection's seminal works, such as the first major Barney. Thanks to Elaine, the Museum has the most important collection of Gonzalez-Torres anywhere, and arguably the most important collection of Nauman and Gober in any American museum. Elaine was ever a prescient collector who remained on the sharpest part of the cutting edge of the art world, understanding and appreciating works that were often difficult for those half her age to appreciate or even understand. It is impossible to think of Elaine without thinking of her husband Werner. She clearly had the eye that formed the collection, but she credited Werner with giving her the support (both moral and financial) to realize her vision. At the opening of the exhibition, Elaine described their partnership and her own transformation in these words: ''Werner is the one who created me. He took a young, curious girl and taught her to focus. He opened all the doors for me and made it all happen. In 1982, a young professor at Columbia heard I was collecting works from emerging artists at a furious pace. She called me up to ask if I would speak to her class. I said that I was not qualified, that I had nothing to say, but that I would be happy to answer her students' questions. We set up a date. The morning of our appointment, Werner and I were having breakfast, and he asked what I was doing that day. I said that I was giving a talk at Columbia. He said, ''This I have to see,'' and called up his secretary to cancel all of his appointments for the day. He came up to Columbia with me and sat in the audience with the students. They asked questions nonstop and I answered them all. Werner was so impressed with me that he raised my art allowance. And the rest is history.'' Elaine has passed from being simply a collector, patron, and friend into being a historical figure whose spirit and devotion will live on forever at The Museum of Modern Art.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DANNHEISSER, ELAINE (MRS. WERNER H.)","DANNHEISSER - Elaine (Mrs. Werner H.). The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art, along with the members of its International Council, join the art world in mourning the loss of Elaine Dannheisser. Elaine had served as a Trustee of the Museum since 1995, a member of its Committee on Painting and Sculpture since 1990, a member of its Committee on Photography since 1996, and a member of its International Council since 1991. However, these positions do not begin to convey the many ways in which she permanently influenced the Museum's collection, as well as the way in which we experience and study contemporary art. Just four years ago, we celebrated the opening of On the Edge: Contemporary Art from the Werner and Elaine Dannheisser Collection at the Museum. The works of art that entered the Museum's collection on this occasion were as crucial to the collection as the bequest that came to us from one of the Museum's founders, Lillie P. Bliss, whose gift was the basis of our permanent collection and included many works that continue to be most closely associated with the Museum. Our founding Director, Alfred Barr, believed that the Museum's collection should evolve ''as a torpedo moving through time,'' and Elaine's gift enabled it to do just that. Future generations will identify this Museum with works from the Dannheisser collection, such as those by Matthew Barney, Joseph Beuys, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Jeff Koons, Brice Marden, Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke, Robert Ryman, Richard Serra, and Cindy Sherman, just as current ones identify it with Water Lilies, The Starry Night, and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Beginning as a girl from Brooklyn whose mother brought her to the Museum to see Guernica, Elaine has now taken her place alongside such benefactors as Mrs. Simon Guggenheim, Harriet and Sidney Janis, Philip Johnson, William S. Paley, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Louise Reinhardt Smith, and Gordon Bunshaft. Elaine was a consummate collector (acquiring new work right up until the very end), but was also the most insightful benefactress. Over the years, Elaine formed a collection that was deeply personal and distinctly her own. When she decided to give it to the Modern, however, she was doubly generous: in addition to making a monumental gift, she allowed the Museum to accept the works that were needed to build a balanced collection. In some cases, she helped augment existing areas of the collection that were missing key pieces. In others, she gave us the collection's seminal works, such as the first major Barney. Thanks to Elaine, the Museum has the most important collection of Gonzalez-Torres anywhere, and arguably the most important collection of Nauman and Gober in any American museum. Elaine was ever a prescient collector who remained on the sharpest part of the cutting edge of the art world, understanding and appreciating works that were often difficult for those half her age to appreciate or even understand. It is impossible to think of Elaine without thinking of her husband Werner. She clearly had the eye that formed the collection, but she credited Werner with giving her the support (both moral and financial) to realize her vision. At the opening of the exhibition, Elaine described their partnership and her own transformation in these words: ''Werner is the one who created me. He took a young, curious girl and taught her to focus. He opened all the doors for me and made it all happen. In 1982, a young professor at Columbia heard I was collecting works from emerging artists at a furious pace. She called me up to ask if I would speak to her class. I said that I was not qualified, that I had nothing to say, but that I would be happy to answer her students' questions. We set up a date. The morning of our appointment, Werner and I were having breakfast, and he asked what I was doing that day. I said that I was giving a talk at Columbia. He said, ''This I have to see,'' and called up his secretary to cancel all of his appointments for the day. He came up to Columbia with me and sat in the audience with the students. They asked questions nonstop and I answered them all. Werner was so impressed with me that he raised my art allowance. And the rest is history.'' Elaine has passed from being simply a collector, patron, and friend into being a historical figure whose spirit and devotion will live on forever at The Museum of Modern Art.

Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Sir Brian Urquhart, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art",2001-10-31T05:00:00+0000

Imation, which has filed an unrelated antitrust lawsuit against Quantum, has been selling cartridges for DLT tape drives without authorization from Quantum since Oct. 1. In granting the preliminary injunction, Judge William J. Elfving of Santa Clara County said a preponderance of evidence shows that Imation had misappropriated Quantum's trade secrets, but he did not order Imation to stop selling the cartridges. Imation said it would continue to sell the cartridges, and a spokesman said the court's order for a 30 percent royalty payment exposed the unusually high royalties sought by Quantum. John Gannon, president of Quantum's DLT Tape Group, denied the antitrust claims and said Imation's products failed to meet Quantum standards. Chris Gaither (NYT)",2001-10-31T05:00:00+0000

us,Will Serbs Take a Chance on Kosovo?," PRISTINA, Kosovo -- More than two years after air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ended the harrowing of Kosovo by Slobodan Milosevic, Kosovo's Serbs remain beset by anxieties. Perhaps half of all Kosovo's Serbs have left for fear of retribution. Hundreds remain missing and unaccounted for. Half of the Serbs still in Kosovo live in small, fortified enclaves where they feel safe only thanks to the presence of NATO troops. Many Serbs cite these conditions, and the fear of Kosovar independence, as reasons for not voting, on Nov. 17, in the first free general elections Kosovo has ever had. But they are seeing the world upside down. These elections are the great opportunity for them, as they are for us, Kosovo's Albanians. ",2001-10-31T05:00:00+0000
