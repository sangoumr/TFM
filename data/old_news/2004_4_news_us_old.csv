Ericsson had predicted earlier that the margin, which measures profit against expenses, would decline. It left unchanged a first-quarter forecast of sales rising 5 percent to 9 percent from a year earlier, without giving any revenue or net income figures.

Mr. Sharon has promised the United States that Israel will not harm Mr. Arafat, though the Israeli cabinet voted in principle last year to remove the Palestinian leader. Israel's Channel 1 television reported that Mr. Sharon said it was not certain that Mr. Arafat could remain forever in his current position. In another development, three American envoys -- Stephen Hadley, Elliott Abrams and William J.

The finding is a blow to Medinol, which said last year that it was trying to stop Boston Scientific from selling stents around the world. Boston Scientific marketed Medinol's Nir brand stents after the Israeli company, which is closely held, won approval to sell them in Europe in 1996 and the United States in 1998.

It is also possible the women were brought in for questioning as the police seek to prevent any protests connected with the 15th anniversary of the crackdown. As part of Tiananmen Mothers, the women -- Zhang Xianling, Ding Zilin and Huang Jinping -- have pressed Chinese leaders to reconsider the 1989 army crackdown and ''rehabilitate'' their dead relatives.

A new biography, ''Baudelaire in Chains,'' insists that intoxication, far from being the wellspring of the poet's spirit, was ''the root of all his problems.'' And that's a lot of problems, observes the author, Frank Hilton, including Baudelaire's ''inability to manage his financial affairs, his unsatisfactory relationships, his bad health, his guignon'' -- the demonic misfortune he believed plagued him -- and, most important, his ''chronic difficulty in getting down to any prolonged creative work.'' All of this Hilton attributes to Baudelaire's opium addiction, which, he argues, other biographers have underestimated. Instead, they have blamed syphilis (a diagnosis that Hilton doubts) and other illnesses for his physical sufferings, the heartlessness of his intimates and the stupidity of the public for the rest.",2004-04-04T05:00:00+0000

The whole plan is expected to cost $320 million and stems from a settlement with Children's Rights Incorporated of New York, a group that sued the state over the treatment of foster children.

Today his 15 symphonies provide a harrowing index of a nation's collective memory; his 15 string quartets probe the private depths of a ruthlessly public era.

At this moment, I am living out of the city, away from the masses, in a bucolic little village with about the same number of inhabitants as my former city block. I wouldn't normally delve into my own personal matters, except that when I mention my rat experiences to people, they sometimes think I took extraordinary measures to investigate them, and I didn't. All I did was stand in an alley-a filth-slicked little alley that is about as old as the city and secret the way alleys are secret and yet just a block or two from Wall Street, from Broadway, and from what used to be the World Trade Center. All I did was take a spot next to the trash and wait and watch, rain or no rain, night after night, and always at night, the time when, generally speaking, humans go to sleep and rats come alive.

us,Detained While Young,"Stephen Elliott's HAPPY BABY (McSweeney's with MacAdam/Cage, $21) is surely the most intelligent and beautiful book ever written about juvenile detention centers, sadomasochism and drugs. Lesser writers might be tempted to milk such material for shock value, but one of Elliott's many gifts is his light touch. Nowhere in this, his fourth novel, does Elliott either overexplain or depict gratuitous brutality. Instead, in episodic chapters told in reverse chronological order, his guiding principles are precision and realism. Theo, the narrator, experienced sexual abuse, violence and occasional camaraderie during his adolescence as a ward of the state of Illinois (Elliot himself was also a ward of the state). As an adult, Theo feels most sexually and emotionally fulfilled when he is being insulted or punished. Seeking out, for example, a prostitute who ''makes'' him wear a diaper, Theo could appear freakish; but he is so fully drawn, and so honest about himself, that he seems touchingly normal. In deft, vivid scenes, other characters also come to life -- the dialogue is both natural-sounding and surprising -- and Theo's first girlfriend, Maria, is especially smart, complicated and, like Theo himself, matter-of-factly rather than self-pityingly unhappy. Though Theo sometimes longs for clarity or peace, both he and the book accept as a given that many people struggle almost all the time -- and that such struggling doesn't preclude moments of humor and comfort. The novel's backward structure means that rather than building momentum, it offers the sense of a mystery being slowly solved. That the mystery of why Theo, or anyone, turns out as he does is essentially unsolvable makes it no less satisfying, or, in Theo's case, less heartbreaking.

The warm odor of malt and corn flour rises from the boats landing at the wharves along the Thames. The stink of cured fish hanging in fishmongers' stalls mixes with the soft smell of bread in the bakeries. The smell of manure is everywhere, in the open sewers, on the town common where cows graze, in the streets where horses haul wagons and coaches. Sometimes a coach rolls through the narrow gate of one of Oxford's colleges, to be swallowed up behind a high, windowless stone wall. The chimneys of the college kitchens relay smoke signals to the surrounding neighborhoods, carrying the smell of roasting capon and mutton or perhaps a goose stolen from a nearby village by students.

There were, of course, several last-stand temptations he'd contemplated while staring at his laptop, and two he'd quixotically pecked to life even though he knew all along they'd never depart his study. The first composition was a blaze of fury, defiance and ""how-dare-you"" indignation. Jacked on coffee and Jonathan Edwards, he wasted an afternoon creating a fiery screed that would have him going out unbowed and bare-knuckled, every syllable a conflagration, every breath a test of will, the pulpit seething with brimstone and bit- ter jabs into the air. Then, on Friday morning, his wife called him a ""pissant,"" and by that evening, during a long, drab rain, a flamboyant collapse seemedfor an hour or so at leastlike a good choice. Midway through this one, he started to use a Pentecostal tongue, typed the word ""Gawd"" a lot and didn't worry about periods, just strung together sentences he could preach big-time, throwing back his head and squeezing his eyes shut, the snot and tears running on his cheeks as he finished his career with a sopping, over-the-top, tent-revival mea culpa full of biblical caterwauling and pitifully rococo pleas to the forgiving heavenly Father.

The prevalent use of drugs at Melville High School in East Setauket is no secret, as attested by the disturbing images of Jimi Hendrix, doves, peace signs and multiracial groups of children holding hands that adorn its walls. In past, drug use among students has led to devil worship, sexual deviancy, Marxism and boys' lacrosse. I am glad we have a school administration that finally appreciates this problem, for there is no greater or more immediate threat to our youth than the war on drugs. The fact that the canine inspectors have not yet found any evidence of contraband does not mean that this is a sweetheart-deal boondoggle. It means that we must give the inspectors more time and all the resources they require. The school is better off than it was a year ago, and local residents are safer because teenage lawlessness is being fought in the schools and not in suburban streets.

Jay Kernis, the network's senior vice president for programming, will hold a live, hourlong Web chat at NPR.org, beginning at 1 p.m. Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR's ombudsman, will be the host. Though Mr. Kernis, who was central in the decision to remove Mr. Edwards, has been responding to complaints through form letters and occasional phone calls, a spokeswoman for the network said it wanted to do more. ''We felt that we wanted to interact as directly as possible,'' said Jessamyn Sarmiento, NPR's director for public and media relations. ''It's not going to change the outcome of what has happened, but hopefully it will help paint the picture of why it happened in a clearer way.'' In addition to the Web chat, NPR has added a link on its Web site that synthesizes and provides answers to the flood of complaints -- more than 25,000 calls and e-mail messages, Ms. Sarmiento said -- that the network has received since announcing on March 23 that Mr. Edwards was being removed from his anchor post and reassigned as a senior correspondent. One of the most frequently asked questions was, ''Is there a chance you will change your mind and bring Bob back?'' The answer, delivered in wordy managerial speak: not likely. Mr. Edwards has negotiated and accepted a new contract and is scheduled to be host of ''Morning Edition'' for the last time on April 30. LYNETTE CLEMETSON",2004-04-05T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Bendixen joined the College of Physicians & Surgeons at Columbia in 1973 as professor and chairman of anesthesiology after serving in posts at the Harvard Medical School and the University of California at San Diego. He was also director of the anesthesiology service at Presbyterian Hospital. He served as acting provost and vice president for the health sciences at Columbia in 1980-81. He was named Alumni Professor for the college in 1984 and the E.M. Papper Professor of Anesthesiology in 1985. He served as vice president and dean from 1984-89 and then became senior associate vice president and senior associate dean in 1989. During his time as vice president and dean he ushered the medical center's schools into the information age. He supported creation of a medical informatics center (now a P&S department) and established the computer infrastructure that has evolved into a ubiquitous educational, clinical, research, and administrative resource. In anesthesiology he was a leader in intensive care, developed new information on the care of patients with respiratory disease, and created the medical center's first department-wide practice plan. When he was named professor emeritus of anesthesiology in 1994, a portrait was unveiled in the medical center library, where it hangs today to honor his contributions to information technology in education, clinical systems, and administration. We extend our condolences to his family and friends and pledge to continue to honor his legacy to Columbia University. Gerald D.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   HALPERN, NATHAN L.","HALPERN--Nathan L. died April 3 at home. A man of strong, agile intellect, life long excellence, high achievement and significant contributions to the quality of life in New York City. He was independent, original and a true American success story. Through his company, Theatre Network Television, he was the USA pioneer and successful business developer of three major areas of television--the multi-city live interactive video conference; the use of large screen TV image magnification for audiences at meetings of all types and special events; and large screen TV presentations of live sports, with replays in major arenas. A tireless, effective Trustee for the Central Park Conservancy, he was proud of being part of and seeing the renaissance of Central Park; as recognition of his efforts, he was made a Life Trustee. He was a benefactor and member of the corporation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was president of the International Center of Photography during an important period of its development; and because of the results, he was made an Honorary Trustee. Born in Sioux City, Iowa to Aaron and Lena Halpern, who had emigrated from Russia, his family finally settled in Los Angeles. Graduating from Theodore Roosevelt High School, he was a top student as well as the basketball scoring leader for the City of Los Angeles. Receiving a scholarship to University of Southern California, he graduated in 1936 with Phi Beta Kappa honors, as well as being a member of three Pacific Conference champion basketball teams. He then came east to Harvard Law School where he was a member and Treasurer of the Law Review. To help with the publication's finances, he developed the idea of publishing volumes of previous years' editions and selling them to interested professionals--a successful venture. Upon graduation, he went as a young lawyer to Washington, D.C. as Assistant to the Chairman of the SEC. While working with the SEC he was given an additional duty to assist in the drafting of the Lend Lease. Then served as Executive Assistant to the Director of WPB 1941-42. During WWII as a Navy Officer, he became Executive Assistant to James Forrestal. Seeking an active role overseas, he became part of the Office of Strategic Services. He participated in the planning of D-Day in London. Executive Assistant to Director of US Information Services (France), he went behind German lines in Belgium and later had duties that brought him all the way through and behind the lines of the advancing Russian troops to start negotiating repatriation of whole populations in Europe. In the course of his OSS assignments, he met William S. Paley, President of CBS and some of the people who worked for him. After the war, he went to work for CBS from 1945-49, becoming Assistant to Mr. Paley during the period. As he learned more about the new medium of television. he developed an innovative concept of closed circuit television--the ''special origination, distribution and display of television to a special audience.'' He left CBS to form his own company. His work over the next 45 years included the first pay-TV events televised live to theatre audiences; the first satellite television telecasts to Europe (Telstar), Japan and China; ten national political conventions in which he was part of changing the entire nature of the televised event through new staging of the rostrum, preparing speakers for TV and special TV presentations for the audience; providing new national private network TV marketing communication for major US companies; designing and providing the high resolution large screen TV technology which NASA used for management of its rocket launches as well as extensive application for all the images from the moon during Apollo 11; breakthrough medical television techniques with live broadcasts from hospitals into major medical meetings involving patient case histories, treatment techniques and live surgeries; many of the biggest sports events and concerts; major meetings of associations, religious denominations, corporations; flight simulator displays and air traffic control. He loved East Hampton and the beach. He became a founding member and president of the East Hampton Beach Preservation Society and, true to form, became an expert as he researched the facts on beaches and erosion/ build up patterns. He was an avid landscaper and tree planter and created a beautiful environment at his home. A voracious reader, a fine eye and appreciation for art and a collector in various categories, a punster, he swam in the ocean and shot baskets regularly until age 85.

Mr. Papadopoulos, left, said the plan would threaten the security of citizens by disbanding the Greek Cypriot army. Earlier, Mr. Denktash said he would campaign for a ""no"" vote in the northern Turkish third of the island, a breakaway state recognized internationally only by Turkey and occupied by 40,000 Turkish troops. He made it clear that he believed the plan would spell an end to that state. Under the plan, Cyprus would become a loose federation. If voters on either side reject the referendums, only the Greek Cypriot south will be represented in the European Union. Polls have pointed to a rejection by Greek Cypriots and approval by Turkish Cypriots by a thin majority. (Reuters) ",2004-04-08T05:00:00+0000

The boys, the eldest of who was ten, died shortly after they had been taken to the London Skin Hospital for treatment for ringworm. On their arrival at the hospital, the examining physician prescribed the rare drug thallium acetate, and he made his prescription out according to the metric system of weights. Consequently, it was necessary for the hospital pharmacist to convert the metric numbers to the apothecary system, not using metric weights but scales. In doing so she misplaced the decimal point, thus increasing the dose tenfold. Administration of the medicine had almost immediate fatal results, death occurring before the attendants realized or could determine the cause. ",2004-04-09T05:00:00+0000

In 2002, during a maintenance operation, the company, AmerGen Energy, shut down a transformer that helps cool hot water before it reaches the creek. The released water was 101 degrees Fahrenheit, or 14 degrees hotter than legally permitted. Nearly 6,000 fish and other wildlife were killed, including stripped bass, white perch and oysters. The state's Department of Environmental Protection said the settlement included an estuary-monitoring program that posts on the Internet the current temperature of nearby Barnegat Bay. Ann Mary Carley, a spokeswoman for AmerGen, said the company took ''full responsibility'' for the incident. She blamed the situation on ''miscommunications.''

In New York alone there have been over six thousand deaths since December 1. Statistics show also that the prevalence of the disease and the ratio of mortality are increasing from year to year in spite of improved sanitation and increasing attention to civic hygiene. This is in marked contrast with the conditions governing the spread of tuberculosis, inasmuch as that disease always flourishes in uncleanly and ill-ventilated quarters. There has been no end of theorizing as to the real causes of epidemic ""lung fever,"" but as yet no definite solution of the problem has been reached. It is so fashionably scientific to match every disease with its microbe that it is no wonder we hear more of the pneumococcus than we ever did before. ",2004-04-10T05:00:00+0000

Fittingly, Terrie Sultan, the director of the Blaffer Gallery, the art museum of the University of Houston, goes much deeper than the usual artist appreciation in CHUCK CLOSE PRINTS: Process and Collaboration (Princeton University, cloth, $49.95; paper, $35). After Sultan's introduction and an essay by Richard Shiff, an art professor at the University of Texas, Austin, whole chapters are devoted to each type of printmaking that Close has mastered. He is interviewed by his longtime collaborators about techniques both familiar (silk-screen) and less so (spitbite etching). Close has called himself ''an artist looking for trouble'' because, as Sultan writes, ''extricating himself from a technical corner becomes a catalyst for his creativity.'' Close is never sure how he will achieve the desired result; part of his talent lies in being up for anything.

The double-decker buses, with their open tops in the spring, where romantic tourists ate their picnic lunches, were scrapped. The old Lafayette restaurant in Greenwich Village was demolished. Schrafft's, with its Irish waitresses in their black dresses, white aprons and lace tiaras, with its date-nut bread, creamed chicken with bright green peas and pineapple sundaes, was dying as if in sympathy with the afflicted cityscape itself. A developer seriously proposed tearing down Carnegie Hall and replacing it with a vertical crate the color of tomato soup. He was thwarted. But another developer got away with wrecking the glorious Pennsylvania Station and erecting in its place a grimy glass and concrete box, the mortal twitch of a dying modernism. Sprouting along Sixth and Third and Lexington, these morbid boxes were like the detritus of an intergalactic invasion.

Since we use our home only about 60 days a year, I feel this requirement is excessive for us. The association is attempting to levy a fine of $250 per year for noncompliance.

But way up on the highest shelf was a thin little text that, every now and then, would catch my eye because it seemed so out of place, like Gulliver among the Brobdingnagians. In hindsight, I'm not quite sure why I waited so long before taking a look. Perhaps, as the years went by, the books seemed less like material you read and more like family heirlooms you admire from afar. Ultimately, such reverence gave way to teenage brashness.

A 90-year-old federation of the state's local boards, the association has criticized Governor McGreevey for saying in his state of the state address that he planned to eliminate nonoperating districts because ''they oversee nothing but their own existence.'' Each such district has a part-time administrator who handles tuition and transportation bills and makes $10,000 to $15,000 a year. The Department of Education plan would dissolve the districts and transfer their duties to their respective municipal governments at an estimated savings of $750,000 statewide.

He retired in 1993 as Senior Vice President and as a member of the Sears Roebuck and Co. Management Committee after a forty year career with Sears. Most recently he was Chairman of the Board of Denny's Corporation, and President of the Homan Arthington Foundation, which was responsible for redeveloping the original Sears headquarters location on Chicago's West Side into affordable housing for threehundred families in the North Lawndale neighborhood. Mr. Moran was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1930, and developed a lifelong love for sports and humor. He starred as a catcher at Drew University in Madison, NJ, played in the Northern League on a team affiliated with the New York Yankees, and earned positions with numerous traveling All-Star baseball teams. He caught batting practice for the Brooklyn Dodgers on several occasions, including for the 1949 Major League All-Star Game held at Ebbets Field. One All-Star team appearance in 1948 led him to Mauch Chunk, PA (now Jim Thorpe, PA), where he met his wife of fifty-two years, Dolores Huber. After a short Army stint, Mr. Moran joined Sears as a trainee in its Hackensack, NJ store. In forty years and seven moves he took on increasing responsibility, ranging from spilling paint as a trainee to selling the Sears Tower, from plowing Sears parking lots to building new parking lots, and from integrating Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker into Sears to then subsequently leading the divestiture of these units. Sears retired Chairman, President and CEO Edward Brennan said ''Charley was a man of great competence and total integrity. Whenever there was a tough challenge, he could be counted on to handle it successfully.'' Mr. Moran also acted as Chairman of Thermadyne Holdings Corporation, and Prodigy Services (a joint venture between Sears and IBM that was a key precursor to the Internet). He acted on numerous corporate boards, including Discover Bank and the Morgan Stanley Trust Company, SPS Transaction Services, Inc., Advantis, Inc., DeSoto, Inc., and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. His other civic contributions included membership in the Sorin Society at the University of Notre Dame, and as a benefactor to many needy students. He leaves a loving family, and numerous friends and colleagues who will miss him for his many contributions. His ongoing legacy is his family--wife, Dolores; daughter, Mary (William) Deatherage; son, Charles (Dianne) Moran; daughter, Alice Moran; son, John (Laura) Moran; and eleven grandchildren.

Challenged by a bare-bones budget of $35,000, the architects did much of the fabrication themselves. They used inexpensive construction materials like corrugated cardboard to create a screen (above) that wraps around the cafe's sitting area, delineating circulation from seating and providing acoustical dampening. Custom oak and stainless steel chairs (above left) mirror the profile of a built-in wraparound bench. The cardboard wall system's steel supports are echoed in hanging steel light fixtures. There is a decorative plaster relief (top left) of 479 individually cast coffee cup lids, gathered from the neighborhood. Paul Lewis said, ''I love the idea that these functional elements could be very repetitive, yet have incredible variation as well.'' Ini Ani serves coffee, tea, and multiethnic snacks including a Persian breakfast of feta, figs, dates, tomatoes and cucumbers. It is at 105 Stanton Street (Ludlow Street); (212) 254-9066.

Mud-spattered pickup trucks park alongside luxury cars, roosters crow throughout the day, and four draft horses live a half block from the town square. The area's Spanish and Mexican heritage is evident in the central plaza, which is surrounded by a historic mission, whitewashed adobe buildings and the fortress barracks of Gen. Mariano Vallejo, the Mexican commander who established Sonoma in 1835. The Sonoma Valley's ideal climate and rich rocky soil also turn out an endless cornucopia of grapes and excellent produce, and award-winning local chefs use the fresh bounty to their advantage.

But we should not forget that grief, rather than depression, is the usual reaction to the death of a child. While feelings of sadness and its associated symptoms of insomnia, poor appetite and weight loss are common to both conditions, it is only depression that may include pervasive feelings of worthlessness and guilt; significant loss of the ability to function socially, occupationally or in self-care; and suicidal thinking and behavior. The suffering caused by depression may be extreme but can be greatly alleviated by timely and appropriate treatment. Armstrong says that it is a ''shame'' to always block out feeling depressed. But for someone who is suffering clinical depression, medical treatment is the most compassionate response.",2004-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Woody Harrelson, Cheech Marin and Sheila Tousey had supporting roles. Mr. Shepard, who had played the ghost in Mr. Almereyda's 2000 film of ''Hamlet'' with Ethan Hawke, was directing. ''This So-Called Disaster: Sam Shepard Directs 'The Late Henry Moss' '' is distilled from Mr. Almereyda's 140 hours of videotape. It examines not just artists burrowing their way into Mr. Shepard's text, but also a writer grappling with the legacy of his ornery, alcoholic father.

Of Ray Kappe, the architecture critic Michael Webb writes in ''Themes and Variations: House Design by Ray Kappe,'' ''This undogmatic but committed modern architect has created a succession of houses that are a comfortable fit for their sites and the needs of their owners.'' In fact, Kappe has designed more than 100 houses since the 1950's, and energy conservation was in the forefront of his consciousness long before California building codes mandated such measures in 1975. Kappe also became known for his sensitive and resourceful solutions to building on steep sites -- a skill he honed with the design of his own house. The house that Kappe designed for Anne Keeler and Gordon Melcher in Pacific Palisades (a) was completed in 1990. It is a taller, narrower version of the concrete-tower-and-laminated-beam structure that Kappe had built for himself decades earlier.

us,The Ocean in the Head,"When Marvin Bell, in his excellent new collection of poems, writes the totally characteristic line ''His spine quivers like a long quill, quite like it,'' it's worth considering what that ''quite like it'' might be doing there. Verbally and rhythmically it functions as a sort of heart murmur, a shrug or flutter after the main pulse of the line. This is Bell's territory in miniature: echo, aftermath, a looking backward through the veil of things. RAMPANT (Copper Canyon, $20) deals in negative space: ''A lit cigarette is building an ash column,'' Bell writes in ''Of a Student''; Gaud's great church in Barcelona ''remains unfinished but / people talk about it''; a wartime experience is so intense it becomes ''a glare, a deficit in memory.'' We are assured in ''The Troubling'' that ''there is an outside beyond the farthest / thing we can imagine.'' As a poet in the office of student or historian of consciousness, Bell performs beautifully, like a less sleek Wallace Stevens. One of this book's highlights is called ''Ulysses, Too, Was Sometimes Down at Heart,'' in which the hero's sea wanderings are shrunk to the size of an anxious 21st-century brain, and oceanic storms contract to a chemical flux in the skull -- the mood swing, the change of the wind, the swing of the boom beneath the sail. ''We have learned to / hear the sound of a rain cloud forming. A mast / nearly snaps. We make that promise again -/ to be steadier, to spend the highs slowly.'' This is sympathy, the real thing.

One of the trickiest feats is to narrate a story in the first-person plural. It's so hard, in fact, that among the dispiritingly vast array of titles shelved in my local bookstore's How to Write Fiction section, few even mention the first-person plural as an option. John Gardner's classic, ''The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,'' refers to it in passing as ''the 'town' point of view, in which the voice in the story is some unnamed spokesman for all the community,'' and notes that William Faulkner's short story ''A Rose for Emily'' is the best-known example. But even in the sentence or two he devotes to the subject, Gardner assumes too much.

His fourteen-year-old Dodge Colt rattled in place in the middle of the Travis Street Bridge, hemmed in on all sides by bulbous, purring pickup trucks and gleaming sport utility vehicles with fat, black tires. The electric blues and greens of these enormous automobiles reflected the dazzling morning glare through Paul's cracked and dirty windshield; they radiated shimmering heat through his open window. Waiting for the light, the fingers of his left hand drumming the scalding side of his car, the skin of his forearm baking to leather in the heat, Paul felt less like a man who deserved more out of life than a peasant on a mule cart trapped in the middle of an armored division.

The agent we had spoken with had recommended getting into the individual market for health insurance while we were in our early 40's and healthy. That way, he said, we could pursue such freelance lives with the assurance that we would always have health coverage. Once you are in the system, he said, you will only be subject to the annual premium increases the insurers apply to everyone.

That will increase the 2002 net loss by about $10 million and reduce 2003 net income by about $14 million. TDS, which is based in Chicago, said that sales would not change. After a review, the company increased the value of the wireless licenses by $230 million, TDS said. Goodwill -- an intangible asset that is the difference between the price paid for an asset and its book value -- decreased by $139 million, and related deferred income taxes rose by $91 million. Increasing the value of the wireless licenses makes them subject to larger write-downs when the market value of the asset is less than the book value, a TDS spokesman, Mark Steinkrauss, said. TDS's net income fell in 2003 and its loss increased in 2002 because the company had to write down the value of some wireless licenses, he said.

us,Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Willingboro: Nurses On Strike,"Nearly 290 nurses went out on strike yesterday at Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County. Temporary workers filled their shifts. The nurses began picketing after another failed attempt at contract negotiations on Friday. The unions' central concern in the proposed contract is an existing clause that grants the hospital, according to the union, too much discretion in determining when and where nurses work. Management disputes that description. Union officials said that hospital administrators had used that language recently to abuse nurses' rights, pointing to last October, when management reorganized three hospital units. The resulting shift and assignment changes disrupted the nurses' lives and lessened time with patients, the union said. There were no plans yesterday to resume negotiations.

Foodservice, one of the largest food distributors in the United States, reported a $218 million operating loss last year. It recorded a $148 million profit in 2002. Ahold executives attributed the Foodservice loss in part on difficulties with suppliers after the accounting scandal. Several of Ahold's supermarket chains in the United States, including Giant-Landover, reported significant declines in operating income because of a weak dollar and retail margin pressures. Ahold's total 2003 sales were down 10.6 percent, to 56.1 billion euros ($67.4 billion). Gregory Crouch (NYT)",2004-04-20T05:00:00+0000

He joined CSFB in November, 2000, when the firm merged with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where he was a Managing Director, Founder and CoHead of the Private Fund Group. He joined DLJ in 1994 from Merrill Lynch in Chicago, whre he was a Vice President with responsibility for raising institutional private equity for various investment partnerships. Prior to that, Mr. Schultz spent six years with Morgan Stanley in the Fixed Income and Financial Services Group. He received a BA from Trinity College. Mr. Schultz was known for the energy and enthusiasm he brought to his many interests. His avid love of music flowed from his skill at the piano to an encyclopedic knowledge of both popular and classical music. No less a student of the arts and literature, Mr. Schultz brought the intensity and intelligence that drove his business success to bear in these areas as well, providing him with an engaging charm born of his easy familiarity with so many facets of culture. He founded Bordigera Vineyards in 1999, the culmination of his interest in wine, encompassing with typical thoroughness the soil, the vines, and their combination in the wine making process. His daughters' love of horses translated into the establishment of Bordigera Stables, yet another example of the passion Mr. Schultz brought to all of his accomplishments.

Congress voted in 2002 to allow up to $8 billion in Liberty Bonds to provide tax-free financing to help New York City rebuild after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The lead plaintiff in the suit, Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, said that the plant was not in Lower Manhattan and did not fit the definition of nonresidential real property required by the federal statute, and that local residents were opposed to another plant in the area. Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, who is a defendant in the lawsuit, said the project met the criteria for the program because it allowed up to $2 billion in bonds to be used outside Lower Manhattan for projects benefiting the entire city. She called the lawsuit ''frivolous'' and said that when completed, the plant would provide up to 10 percent of the city's energy. Al Baker (NYT)",2004-04-20T05:00:00+0000

The so-called ''reclamation claimants,'' which sold to Fleming just before its bankruptcy, include the H.J. Heinz Company, ConAgra Foods, the Hershey Foods Corporation and dozens of others. They are normally entitled to claiming their products back, and have confronted Fleming over its proposed Chapter 11 plan.

The five appeals judges, whose decision is final, settled a question much debated by legal scholars: was the persecution and killing of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs and others, known as ethnic cleansing. a deliberate genocidal campaign? Referring to the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995, the court said the crime ''should be called by its proper name: genocide.'' The ruling came in an appeal by Radislav Krstic, above, a Bosnian Serb general and the only person yet convicted of genocide in the former Yugoslavia. The judges reduced his sentence to 35 years from 46 because he had ''aided and abetted genocide'' in Srebrenica but had not taken part in it. Legal scholars said the ruling on genocide, the most serious of war crimes, was likely to have an important effect on the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president, and on other cases.

us,THE VIRTUAL ORCHESTRA (CONTINUED),"The Opera Company of Brooklyn has formally withdrawn from a recent agreement with the Broadway musicians union that would have prevented the opera from using a so-called virtual orchestra machine, a sophisticated synthesizer that closely approximates the sound of real musicians. Jay D. Meetze, the company's founder and principal conductor, said in a statement that he objected to efforts by the union, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, to dictate which instruments he could use. ''The union has gone too far by trying to take away my choices for artistic expression,'' Mr. Meetze said. In response, David Lennon, the president of Local 802, said his union had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board against the opera company.

The New York State Banking Department issued a 30-day suspension order to Cashpoint Network Services Inc. on Wednesday, citing its failure to pay creditors and maintain its books and records, among other things. City finance officials said the suspension was expected to affect about 4,700 city employees who do not have checking accounts and regularly use the service to cash their paychecks. Cashpoint, which operates or oversees more than 400 neighborhood payment centers, was also used by residents to pay their parking tickets and their real estate and water and sewer bills. Hundreds of other Cashpoint centers across the state were also shut down. City finance officials urged people to pay their bills by mail, over the Internet or at the department's business centers.

Sydney spent many of the ensuing episodes caught in a love triangle with her ex-boyfriend (a fellow spy named Michael Vaughn) and the woman he married while Bristow was gone.

The song comes from his new CD, ''Hurt No More'' (Bad Boy/Universal), one of the year's best R & B albums so far.

They believe that his eye-popping home-run totals of the past few years were ''artificially encouraged,'' as Hemingway once said of doped-up racehorses.

us,'The Shadow of the Wind'," Asecret's worth depends on the people from whom it must be kept. My first thought on waking was to tell my best friend about the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Tomas Aguilar was a classmate who devoted his free time and his talent to the invention of wonderfully ingenious contraptions of dubious practicality, like the aerostatic dart or the dynamo spinning top. I pictured us both, equipped with flashlights and compasses, uncovering the mysteries of those bibliographic catacombs. Who better than Tomas to share my secret? Then, remembering my promise, I decided that circumstances advised me to adopt what in detective novels is termed a different modus operandi. At noon I approached my father to quiz him about the book and about Julian Carax-both world famous, I assumed. My plan was to get my hands on his complete works and read them all by the end of the week. To my surprise, I discovered that my father, a natural-born librarian and a walking lexicon of publishers' catalogs and oddities, had never heard of The Shadow of the Wind or Julian Carax. Intrigued, he examined the printing history on the back of the title page for clues. ",2004-04-25T05:00:00+0000

The budgets under consideration totaled more than $9.5 billion. The results were seen as an indication that residents by and large supported increases as state aid remains stagnant. ''I think voters understood the situation boards were in,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the association. ''They have had inadequate state aid and rising costs not in their control.'' Voters supported increases in 39 of the 75 districts where the increases exceeded the state-imposed cap of more than 3 percent. Last year, one-third of those increases were approved. The election was by no means a rubber stamp. In one closely contested district, Fairfield, Essex County, the vote was tied 201 to 201 and is considered a defeat; the budget must now be decided by the town council. In Moorestown, Burlington County, in another close vote, the budget was defeated 1,056 to 1,037. Debra Nussbaum",2004-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Along with Jillana, one of the original ballerinas in Mr. Balanchine's ''Liebeslieder Walzer,'' which will be performed that evening, the presence of dancers like Melissa Hayden, Pat McBride, Yvonne Mounsey and Jacques d'Amboise promises to make the first ring of the New York State Theater more dazzling than the stage.

Photograph after photograph debunks the myth that cats are aloof loners. There are glorious images of cats playing together, lying languorously in the sun, even mating. ''It's surprising to what degree cats' relationships resemble our own,'' Silvester writes. His images capture cats on the hoods of cars and on motorcycle seats, hiding under chairs, and walking with tails draped over each other  the embodiments of affection. There is a breathtaking series of photographs of two cats jumping together (almost gleefully, it appears) from ledge to ledge. ''Cats are an element of the island landscape,'' Silvester writes, ''like the wind, the sun, and the sea; they are a constant, like the coming of day and night.'' Carolyn T.

us,'The President of Good and Evil'," George W. Bush is not only America's president, but also its most prominent moralist. No other president in living memory has spoken so often about good and evil, right and wrong. His inaugural address was a call to build ""a single nation of justice and opportunity."" A year later, he famously proclaimed North Korea, Iran and Iraq to be an ""axis of evil,"" and in contrast, he called the United States ""a moral nation."" He defends his tax policy in moral terms, saying that it is fair, and gives back to taxpayers what is rightfully theirs. The case he makes for free trade is ""not just monetary, but moral."" Open trade is a ""moral imperative."" Another ""moral imperative,"" he says, is alleviating hunger and poverty throughout the world. He has said that ""America's greatest economic need is higher ethical standards."" In setting out the ""Bush doctrine,"" which defends preemptive strikes against those who might threaten America with weapons of mass destruction, he asserted: ""Moral truth is the same in every culture, in every time, and in every place."" But in what moral truths does the president believe? Considering how much the president says about ethics, it is surprising how little serious discussion there has been of the moral philosophy of George W. Bush. ",2004-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Loving father of Paul, Jane, Robin and John (Hinchcliff). Doting grandfather of Kate, Abby, and Emily. Graduate CCNY; MA, NYU. Worked at PM newspaper with his good friend George Nelson. Served in the Army Air Corps in WWII. A lifelong ad man and marketing consultant, early on Mill worked for the American Jewish Committee and did publicity for Nathan's of Coney Island. He worked with James Beard and other notables in the food world. In the 1950's, Mill became a partner in The Lampert Agency. He had a long association with Strathmore Paper, and later in life was VP of Marketing at Impressions of Roslyn. He was a regular contributor to ''Communication Arts.'' Mill was a fine writer --precise, elegant language was his to command. He was an accomplished sculptor, working in various media. He loved music & art, across a heroically eclectic spectrum, but what truly defined Mill was his passionate, immutable belief that everyone was entitled to social justice, to be able to work with dignity at a fair wage, and to be able to live their lives unburdened by oppression and fear. Mill marched for civil rights and for the rights of women to choose their reproductive destinies. He found war and aggression and imperialism abhorrent. He was a wonderful husband, and is sorely missed by those who loved him. Linda S. Miller-Roseman",2004-04-25T05:00:00+0000

At his side were his children, Norma Penn, Neil Edelman, Terry Tannenbaum, son-in-law David Penn, daughter-in-law Shelley Edelman and his grandchildren Jonathan, Ricki, Jeremy, Jessica, Jillian, Ryanne and Evan. William's beloved wife Esther had passed away suddenly in 1991. Both of them, Holocaust survivors, had endured so many difficult years of devastating experiences and the annihilation of most of their families. Yet, together they persevered, overcame their tragedies and created a wonderful and loving life for them and their children here, in America. William was a man of slight build, but a ''Giant of a Man'' as he towered among everyone with his kindness, generosity, intellect, warmth and love. For he was truly ''over 10 feet tall.'' He leaves a legacy to those who knew and loved him as a relative, friend and business associate, of a human being who knew how to live, how to survive, how to deal with life's adversities. There was always a warm greeting, a kind word, and a true interest in your well-being when you were with William. You knew he cared about you and you respected him and loved him for it. William was born on December 27, 1921 in BiallerPodliask, Poland, one of five children. At the age of 19, he left for Russia as the Nazis entered Poland. He joined the Russian army and fought in a Polish division. He and one other member of his division were the sole survivors of a brutal onslaught by the Nazis. At the end of the war he returned to his hometown to see if anyone else had survived. His entire famlily with the exception of one sister had been slaughtered. It was upon his return that he met Esther, who, with one of her sisters, were the sole survivors of their family. He eventually married Esther and lived in a Displaced Persons Camp, where their first child Norma was born. Soon thereafter in 1950, the family left for America, where they first settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. William was a butcher, struggling and working to support and feed three children, which now included Neil and Terry. At the same time, he attended Brooklyn College in an effort to educate himself with the hope and expectation of being able to create a better life for his family. He managed, in spite of the financial difficulties, to save money and miraculously became a Real Estate Builder and Developer. He actually had to leave college a few credits short of a Bachelor of Science Degree because the business had grown to such an extent that it required 100% of his time. In the late 1950s William became a major developer of the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and in Staten Island. In the 1970s he built The Georgetowne hi-rise on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. Eventually his son Neil and son-inlaw David joined the business. Throughout the 1950s and even today, he and his firm, Forest View, and the Georgetowne are well-regarded and respected in the building construction industry. William was a member of the Board of Directors of the Israeli Humanitarian Foundation and Secretary of the Bialler Society (an organization of survivors of the Holocaust from the area surrounding his birthplace). William will truly be missed by all those whose paths he crossed, but the experience of life took on a unique meaning for each of them because of the richness of what he had imparted, for William was truly a ''Gentleman.''",2004-04-26T05:00:00+0000

The beloved husband of Maria, the adored father of Christina and CJ and the cherished grandfather to Charles and Jeremiah Reen, died peacefully of natural causes on Sunday, April 25. He was 91. The son of immigrant parents and born in the Tremont section of the Bronx, Charles' abundant life was the quintessential American success story. At a young age, Charles formed the values and character that made him legendary to friends and strangers alike throughout his life. He placed utmost importance on integrity, loyalty and commitment, so much that he altered his driver's license by two years in order to join the New York Fire Department. As a Fireman 1st Class with Ladder Company 13, Charles was awarded the Walter Scott Medal for Exceptional Valor by Mayor O'Dwyer on June 3, 1946. To rescue a trapped man, Charles forced his way into a blazing building even before other firemen could put a hose to the flames or clear the place of smoke or gas. He carried the man to safety. After retiring from the NYFD, Charles and his brothers founded what became Edenwald Contracting Co, Inc. of Whitestone, Queens. By the 1980's, Edenwald had grown to become one of the largest municipal and utility contractors in New York. During his time, Charles with his brother George were the Chief Executives of the firm which performed hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects prior to 1994. Edenwald was also responsible for such notable projects as the US Open Tennis Center in Flushing, NY, and the award-winning Washington Market Park in Tribeca. First Lady Nancy Reagan honored Charles and his company's contributions to its design and construction. In later years, Charles became a successful developer in association with the Rockefeller Group in Mount Olive, NJ, and also throughout Whitestone, Queens. Charles spent these later years devoted to his family, especially his grandsons, Charlie and Jeremiah, whose presence for a man so advanced in age was the greatest gift God could bestow. Family, friends and acquaintances honor and treasure the memory of someone so trusted that his word was his bond, and truly a man among men.

Italy, which has outlawed capital punishment, has agreed to extradite the man, Benedetto Cipriani, 48, under the terms of an agreement with prosecutors, who agreed not to seek the death penalty. Sgt. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the Connecticut State Police, said yesterday that Mr. Cipriani was arrested last week outside Rome. In December, three men were charged with murder in the deaths of the two men who owned B & B Automotive in Windsor Locks and a mechanic who worked there. Court records suggest that the killings may have been the bitter ending of Mr. Cipriani's love affair with the wife of one of the owners. Stacey Stowe (NYT)",2004-04-27T05:00:00+0000

Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest local telephone company, said that it was urging the Federal Communications Commission to adopt similar rules nationally. Denver-based Qwest is using the policy in its local-service territory, which covers 14 Western states. Qwest said it was the only one of the four regional phone carriers known as Baby Bells to adopt such a stance. The move comes as Internet-phone start-ups like Vonage Holdings increasingly take customers from local carriers, which are also starting to offer similar services, as Qwest has done. The move will not have a big financial effect on the company, because less than 1 percent of Qwest's call-connection fees comes from Internet-phone services, Qwest's senior vice president, R. Steven Davis, said. The company collects several hundred million dollars annually in total fees, said Mr. Davis, who could not immediately provide a precise number. The policy would speed the spread of so-called voice-over-Internet protocol, or VoIP services, and would benefit customers, the industry and Qwest, the company said.

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Bronx: Homeless Man's Death a Homicide,"After more than a year in which the cause of death of a homeless man imprisoned at Riker's Island was undetermined, the police on Sunday reclassified his death as a homicide. The man, Philip Generoso, 47, developed an acute case of pneumonia while serving a one-and-a-half- to two-year sentence, and died on Feb. 4, 2003. An autopsy revealed that he had no spleen, and that because the spleen plays an important role in the body's immune system, its absence had probably contributed to his getting pneumonia. The police located Mr. Generoso's sister this month, and last week she told them that on Feb. 17, 2002, Mr. Generoso was assaulted, and so badly injured that his spleen was surgically removed. The police said they were now investigating the assault, which contributed to his death. Ian Urbina (NYT)",2004-04-27T05:00:00+0000

The United States and the European Union had hoped they could overcome that resistance through political pressure. But the hard fact is that the Greek Cypriots knew their government would be joining the E.U. on May 1 as ''Cyprus,'' with or without a deal with the Turkish north.

In the first of three days of closed hearings this week in Eagle, Judge W. Terry Ruckriegle heard arguments about the relevance of the 19-year-old accuser's sexual history and whether the police improperly obtained statements and other evidence last summer from Mr. Bryant, 25. He is accused of raping the woman, a hotel employee but has said that the sex was consensual.

Nancy Weiss Malkiel, dean of the undergraduate college, called the vote a ''strong affirmation'' and said the focus now would be on implementing the plan and being sensitive to concerns raised by both faculty and students. Some critics had charged that Princeton students would be at a disadvantage in the job market and in graduate schools if Princeton gave fewer A's than other colleges.

The score is by Richard Thomas, and the book and lyrics are by Stewart Lee and Mr. Thomas. Before the show moves to New York, it will have a six-week tryout at the Orpheum Theater in San Francisco during the spring of 2005.

The shot heard round Washington benefited from several factors, including its timing. Stirred up by the recent revelations of Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill, the turmoil over the 9/11 commission and the dawning sense that our Iraq problems are not going away soon, the news media rolled out the red carpet for a book that was rumored to be more critical of the Bush administration - and therefore important - than Woodward's previous reporting. The result has been a little difficult to decipher amid the cacophony of television chatter and White House denials (to say nothing of the ka-ching of cash registers). But a serious book it is, instantly essential, matching America's most celebrated political reporter against the most secretive administration in our history.

The bank said the discrepancy in earnings of 4.2 billion Swiss francs was because of the different treatment the United States standards applied to a write-down of good will created by the 1997 merger with the Swiss insurer Winterthur.

Mr. Hess was the husband of Mary Ann Van Hess and the late Jane Vosper Hess who died in 1996. Mr. Hess was born in Chicago. His father Carl died when John was three years old. He was raised by his mother, Ollie, and stepfather, Dr. J.P. Greenhill. He graduated from the University of Chicago Lab School in 1935, and-with distinction-from Dartmouth in 1939, where he pursued his lifelong ambition to be a writer. After a post-graduate year at Yale Drama School, he began his professional career as a staff writer for WGN radio in Chicago. His work was interrupted when he enlisted in the army in July 1942. Mr. Hess trained at the army's Advanced Tank Officers School, and joined his unit, the 743rd Armored Battalion, in Europe as a second lieutenant in September 1944. He served as the 743rd's transportation officer, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and other major engagements in Belgium, Holland and Germany. After the defeat of Germany, he assisted victims of concentration camps and helped relocate refugees throughout Europe. Prior to his repatriation to the U.S., in September 1945, he authored Move Out, Verify The Combat Story of the 743rd Tank Battalion, a history of tank combat in WWII. He was honorably discharged as a captain in January 1946. After the war, he returned to Chicago, resuming his position at WGN as a contributing writer for the station's nationally broadcast radio programs. He also authored short stories for magazines such as Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. In 1950, Mr. Hess originated and wrote a live-broadcast television soap opera called ''Love of Life'', which ran for thirty years. He also wrote other leading daytime soaps, including ''Secret Storm'' and ''General Hospital''. He supplemented this with concurrent work in the theatre, his first love. In 1953, his controversial play, ''The Gray Eyed People'' was produced on Broadway, starring Walter Matthau, with direction by Morton Da Costa. He also was deeply involved with Mike Ellis' Bucks County Playhouse in the 1950's and 1960's where his plays ''The Facts of Life'', ''The Better Mousetrap,'' and ''A Perfect Frenzy'' premiered. In 1959, his original feature-length television mystery ''The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deeks'' was broadcast by Ford Startime to critical acclaim. Starring Alec Guiness in his American television debut, it was directed by Franklin Schaffner. In 1961, he wrote and produced a feature movie thriller '' Matter of Morals'' starring Patrick O'Neal and Maj-Britt Nillson. Directed by Hollywood veteran John Cromwell, the film was released by Twentieth Century Fox. Over the next two and a half decades, Mr. Hess wrote for a virtual who's who of major nighttime television series. His work included episodes of comedies, ''MASH'', ''Alice'' and ''One Day At A Time'', and dramas, ''Streets of San Francisco'', ''The Rockford Files'', and ''Ben Casey''. Mr. Hess' principal home was New Hope, PA, where he was active in community affairs. Following the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ann Van. They lived together in Bucks County from 1997 to his death. In addition to his wife, Mr. Hess is survived by sons Anthony G. Hess of New Hope and Oliver G. Hess of Ojai, CA, his brother Carl B. Hess of New York, and grandsons John T. and Carl T. Hess of Ojai. Services private. Memorial donations in Mr. Hess's name may be made to the John D.

Mr. Hess was the husband of Mary Ann Van Hess and the late Jane Vosper Hess who died in 1996. Mr. Hess was born in Chicago. His father Carl died when John was three years old. He was raised by his mother, Ollie, and stepfather, Dr. J.P. Greenhill. He graduated from the University of Chicago Lab School in 1935, and-with distinction-from Dartmouth in 1939, where he pursued his lifelong ambition to be a writer. After a post-graduate year at Yale Drama School, he began his professional career as a staff writer for WGN radio in Chicago. His work was interrupted when he enlisted in the army in July 1942. Mr. Hess trained at the army's Advanced Tank Officers School, and joined his unit, the 743rd Armored Battalion, in Europe as a second lieutenant in September 1944. He served as the 743rd's transportation officer, and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and other major engagements in Belgium, Holland and Germany. After the defeat of Germany, he assisted victims of concentration camps and helped relocate refugees throughout Europe. Prior to his repatriation to the U.S., in September 1945, he authored Move Out, Verify The Combat Story of the 743rd Tank Battalion, a history of tank combat in WWII. He was honorably discharged as a captain in January 1946. After the war, he returned to Chicago, resuming his position at WGN as a contributing writer for the station's nationally broadcast radio programs. He also authored short stories for magazines such as Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. In 1950, Mr. Hess originated and wrote a live-broadcast television soap opera called ''Love of Life'', which ran for thirty years. He also wrote other leading daytime soaps, including ''Secret Storm'' and ''General Hospital''. He supplemented this with concurrent work in the theatre, his first love. In 1953, his controversial play, ''The Gray Eyed People'' was produced on Broadway, starring Walter Matthau, with direction by Morton Da Costa. He also was deeply involved with Mike Ellis' Bucks County Playhouse in the 1950's and 1960's where his plays ''The Facts of Life'', ''The Better Mousetrap,'' and ''A Perfect Frenzy'' premiered. In 1959, his original feature-length television mystery ''The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deeks'' was broadcast by Ford Startime to critical acclaim. Starring Alec Guiness in his American television debut, it was directed by Franklin Schaffner. In 1961, he wrote and produced a feature movie thriller '' Matter of Morals'' starring Patrick O'Neal and Maj-Britt Nillson. Directed by Hollywood veteran John Cromwell, the film was released by Twentieth Century Fox. Over the next two and a half decades, Mr. Hess wrote for a virtual who's who of major nighttime television series. His work included episodes of comedies, ''MASH'', ''Alice'' and ''One Day At A Time'', and dramas, ''Streets of San Francisco'', ''The Rockford Files'', and ''Ben Casey''. Mr. Hess' principal home was New Hope, PA, where he was active in community affairs. Following the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ann Van. They lived together in Bucks County from 1997 to his death. In addition to his wife, Mr. Hess is survived by sons Anthony G. Hess of New Hope and Oliver G. Hess of Ojai, CA, his brother Carl B. Hess of New York, and grandsons John T. and Carl T. Hess of Ojai. Services private. Memorial donations in Mr. Hess's name may be made to the John D.

In a separate development, the company president, Lawrence Jacobson, quit after three years. The company has no plans to replace Mr. Jacobson at this time, the chief executive, Rob Glaser, said. The net loss equaled 6 cents a share, increasing from $2.84 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier, the Seattle-based company said in a statement. Analysts had estimated that the loss would be 4 cents a share. Sales rose 29 percent, to $60.4 million, exceeding the $57.1 million estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. The loss reflects costs of $2.32 million for an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and expenses to remove golf programming from RealNetworks' subscription service. The company said sales this quarter would be $63 million to $65 million, above analyst estimates of $59.3 million. The company forecast a loss of 3 cents or 4 cents a share, including 1 cent or 2 cents a share for legal costs. The shares fell 51 cents, to $6.09.

The venture could be seen as one of several recent efforts by the partners, Stephen Sills (on left, inset) and James Huniford (right), to redeem their reputations after a 2000 New York magazine article detailed complaints from clients who thought they had wildly overpaid for antiques and other furnishings (charges the partners have denied). Mr. Sills said the store would attract ''a young, upwardly mobile'' customer with ''a lot of money'' -- though not necessarily as much as his clients usually spend. Mr. Huniford said he envisioned customers who dress in Stella McCartney ready-to-wear and have never decorated before. They said they were not worried about diverting clients who typically pay twice as much for similarly styled pieces, custom-made with somewhat better materials. The store, with dead-simple dcor, offers the firm's Southampton Cube armchair ($2,650), Plaster Column lamp ($1,400) and Tufted Back sofa ($5,800), above the inset; and vintage pieces, including a $14,500 pair of painted dressers and an abandoned beehive ($3,800), top right. Mr. Huniford described Dwellings as a converted floor-through on the second floor of a town house, although the location might better be described as occupying the third floor, above a celebrity dermatologist. The address is 30 East 67th Street (Madison Avenue); www.dwellingshome.com or (800) 953-3267. CRAIG KELLOGG",2004-04-29T05:00:00+0000

Bloomberg said yesterday that the city would work with the vendors at the Bronx Terminal Market to keep them from going out of business when the lease for the property changes hands.

Related Companies, the developer completing the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, recently bought out the Terminal Market's city lease.
