us,Quirky Play Leads to Lidge's Unraveling,"PHILADELPHIA - Brad Lidge has been around long enough to enjoy a perfect season and also blow some big save opportunities. But he had never been involved in a play quite like the one that preceded his unraveling in the ninth inning. So unfamiliar with it, Lidge did not even know what his responsibilities were supposed to be. With the score tied and two outs in the ninth, the Phillies were in a shift to the right side of the infield with Mark Teixeira at the plate batting left-handed, and Johnny Damon on first base after a classic nine-pitch at-bat single. Damon stole second base and third baseman Pedro Feliz had to take the throw from the catcher, leaving third base barren of defenders. (Watch the video of the play here.) So, what should Lidge have done? Cover third base? Back up the plate when the catcher covers third? Stand and watch? Run over too late? ""To be honest, that's not something you really go over a lot,"" Lidge said. ""I don't know who's supposed to cover third on that. It's kind of a weird play. No one ends up being there and it kind of ends up being a foot race, and he's faster than I am and he got there before I did."" Damon saw the empty bag beckoning and sprinted to it. Lidge reacted off the mound too late, and now he had a runner on third base with two outs. What followed were three Yankees runs and a 7-4 victory that put them on the verge of their 27th World Series championship. ""He's a heads-up player, and he was able to take an extra base there, which was obviously pretty big,"" Lidge said. Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said catcher Carlos Ruiz should have covered, and shortstop Jimmy Rollins said he was at fault for not reminding Lidge to be wary of the play. Clearly the Phillies were in a defensive formation in which not everyone knew all the contingencies. But Lidge did know one thing. He had gotten two quick outs and looked strong. He still had a chance to get out of the inning after it all happened, and he did not claim to be flustered or distracted by it afterward. Still, the results were disastrous. Lidge hit Teixeira with a fastball that rode inside, and with runners at first and third, Alex Rodriguez drilled a fastball into the left-field corner, scoring Damon to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead. Lidge was asked if he was hesitant to throw sliders to Rodriguez with Damon at third, concerned perhaps that one of them might get away and allow Damon to score on a wild pitch. He said he was not. In fact, breaking balls were impending. ""We would have gone to sliders real soon,"" he said. ""I probably should have done it sooner.""",2009-11-02T07:09:31+0000

It was so boring because she didnt make any mistakes, announced Casey Spooner, one part of the electroclash (remember that?) duo Fischerspooner onstage at MoMA on Sunday evening as part of Performa 2009. Between the Worlds, the groups three-hour performance supporting their newest album, Entertainment, celebrated the imperfections and rawness of a dress rehearsal. The audience literally entered through the back stage, getting a close-up of the dancers shimmying into their different D.I.Y. showgirl outfits: leotards accessorized with colorful knee pads, ripped-up gowns and silver running suits that looked liked they were issued from NASA.But it was Spooner who stole the show with his getups  from corsets to Kabuki  and his snarky running commentary. The singer arrived onstage in a bolero jacket and slicked back platinum hair  for a band that seems stuck in the 80s, this seemed to be a subtle homage to Adam Ant. As he serpentined through his dancers, a veritable hall of mirrors and racks of clothes, he faced the room full of arty hipsters as if he were making his debut to a crowd of 50,000 at the Meadowlands. In fact, the whole performance, snafus and all, was about superstardom. There was the de rigueur talk of the current queen of all things pop, Lady Gaga, and of course the former king of pop, Michael Jackson  at one point Spooner changed into a silver sequined suit and black hat, looking like he stepped out of the This Is It documentary.

But for now, they just need new owners. Variety reported that the Halcyon Company, which owns the rights to the Terminator movies and related assets, plans to sell the franchise at an auction in January as it goes through bankruptcy. When Halcyon purchased the Terminator property for $30 million in 2007, it became the latest in a series of owners that previously included the producer Gale Anne Hurd and the now-defunct production company Carolco. Though the latest entry in the film series, Terminator: Salvation, grossed $369 million worldwide on budget of $200 million, Halcyon filed suit in August against a hedge fund that had provided the money to buy the series rights, saying that a backer at the fund engaged in fraudulent dealings, and filed for Chapter 11 in September. The companys founders, Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek, told a bankruptcy court that the Terminator franchise was worth $70 million. In a satirical blog post, Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, said he would pay $10,000 for the series, proposing such new ideas as a Terminator of the Rings fantasy film and a Terminator musical.

D. Robb. As of Tuesday morning, Amazon still had those titles priced at $9 while Wal-Mart, which had offered them on preorder at $8.98, and Target, which had offered preorders for $8.99, had raised their prices. At Walmart.com, for example, Ford County was selling for $12, while The Lacuna was $13.50. At Target.com, The Lacuna was on sale for $18.89 and Kindred in Death was $17. But by late morning, Amazon had raised its prices  The Lacuna and Kindred in Death, for example, were offered for $13.50  while Walmart.com had cut them again. All three novels that went on sale Tuesday were on sale at Walmart.com for $8.99, but by the afternoon, Walmart.com had raised its prices to just one penny lower than the price for the three titles on Amazon.

Sassoon, who dealt with the human toll of war in poems like They and Suicide in the Trenches, volunteered for military service just before Britains entrance into World War I, and was a decorated soldier before he refused to return to duty in 1917. (A manuscript of his statement of refusal is among the items contained in the archive.) In June, several authors including Sebastian Faulks and Sassoons official biographer, Max Egremont, started a campaign to acquire the poets papers following the death of Sassoons son George in 2006.

On Wednesday the National Heritage Memorial Fund in Britain said that it would give about $900,000 toward the purchase of Sassoons archives, which include notebooks he kept on the Western Front during World War I, as well as correspondence, poetry books, photographs and love letters to his wife, Hester. Sassoon, who dealt with the human toll of war in poems like They and Suicide in the Trenches, volunteered for military service just before Britain entered World War I, and he was a decorated soldier before he refused to return to duty in 1917. In June several authors, including Sebastian Faulks and Sassoons official biographer, Max Egremont, started a campaign to acquire Sassoons papers after the death of his son, George, in 2006. With the grant, Cambridge is about $180,000 short of the estates asking price of nearly $2 million for the archive.",2009-11-04T22:36:31+0000

In a news release, press representatives for Hamlet, which began previews at the Broadhurst Theater on Sept. 12 and opened on Oct. 6, said that it had earned back its initial Broadway capitalization of $2.5 million as of the week ending Nov. 1. The play, directed by Michael Grandage, is the latest in a series of hits that have moved to Broadway from the Donmar Warehouse in London, which also yielded Frost/Nixon and Mary Stuart. The success of Hamlet might also have something to do with its star, Jude Law, who plays the melancholy Danish prince (above with Geraldine James), and who has held his own in a celebrity-filled season of Broadway neighbors like Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman and Sienna Miller. The limited run of Hamlet is to end on Dec. 6.",2009-11-04T22:36:55+0000

Similar motivations  in other words, wishful thinking  have helped drive the growing national obsession with organic food. We want our food to taste good, but also to be safe and healthy. That's natural. Food is more than a meal, it's about history, culture, and a common set of rituals. We put food in the mouths of our children; it is the glue that unites families and communities.

They said that the producers would update the creative team on the projects cash-flow problems, and that Ms. Taymor would say that it would be difficult to begin rehearsals before January. Even if the musicals financial difficulties are solved in time for rehearsals to begin this winter, the show is so technically complex  Spider-mans acrobatics and possible mid-air flight for instance  that Ms. Taymor and the producers may not be prepared to open the show by April 29, the cutoff date for Tony Award nominations, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly about the production. If the show is not ready to be considered for the Tonys this season, the reasoning goes, the production team and cast would be better off waiting to open later  assuming the producers arent faced with a huge financial penalty for delaying use of the Hilton Theater, which they have already ripped up to accommodate Ms. Taymors vision for the musical.

A little before 6 p.m., some 40 current and former dancers, in warm-up clothes or street garb, drifted onto the wooden floor. As a pianist picked out strains of Bach, Robert Swinston, a longtime Cunningham dancer who was also the choreographers assistant, held an abbreviated class in Cunningham technique. In recent years, with the master crippled by rheumatoid arthritis, Swinston or another veteran often led students and company dancers through the steps. But Cunningham would still come to the studio every day; now the company was heading forth with lonely solemnity, like a riderless horse that misses the familiar hand on the reins. In this work space where Cunningham created and rehearsed his dances, the uncanny sense that he continued to watch lingered. At the end of the session, as Swinston pressed his hands together in the Namaste gesture of thanks, the dancers hugged one another, their cheeks streaked with tears.",2009-11-06T00:14:09+0000

You need to perform week in and week out. No resting anyone. In college football, the regular season is the playoffs. Think about this weekends Alabama/L.S.U. game. A 3:30 p.m. game on a November Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium with the SEC West on the line definitely has a playoff feel about it. Ohio State/Penn State at Beaver Stadium is basically an elimination game in the Big Ten. At this point in the season, every week is a playoff game for teams like Iowa, Texas, Florida, Boise State, T.C.U. and Cincinnati. The more teams that are undefeated the more important it gets not to lose. No one can afford a let down.

Joe Paterno certainly wanted Pryor to join the Nittany Lions, but he chose the Buckeyes and his career has been a little rocky thus far. Would a marquee road victory help turn things around?

Around a third of that will consist of dedicated galleries, including a permanent display of works from the museums collection, something the museum has not had before. The Parrish hopes to break ground early next year, according to museum officials. ",2009-11-07T00:15:17+0000

The book, which has an intimate, down-to-earth tone, features not only abundant visual material but also interviews with Gehry, his clients (including his wife, Berta), and current and former members of his firm. And seeing projects like his own home, the never-built extravaganza that he designed for the insurance magnate Peter Lewis or the guesthouse (right) that he completed in 1987 for Mike and Penny Winton in Wayzata, Minn., makes you hope Gehry still has another house (or two) in him.",2009-11-07T07:47:27+0000

There are Egg and Swan chairs courtesy of Fritz Hansen, tiny Vipp trash cans and a working lamp by the Danish studio Design by Us. New pieces commissioned just for the house so far include a childlike scribble by the artist Poul Pava and prospective inhabitants by the dollmaker Maileg.

But the result was considered weak for a movie that cost about $175 million (not including marketing costs); starred Jim Carrey as Scrooge, right, and other roles; and received one of the biggest releases yet on higher-priced 3-D screens. Did families decide it looked too dark? Did the motion-capture filmmaking style lessen interest? Or did many people figure they would catch the holiday movie in the weeks ahead? Disney, which noted that the film, directed by Robert Zemeckis, made an additional $12 million in 18 foreign markets, hopes it will do better as the holidays approach. The Michael Jackson concert documentary, This Is It (Sony), held up well in its second week, placing second with about $14 million for a new total of $58 million. The Men Who Stare at Goats, a comedy from Overture Films starring George Clooney and Jeff Bridges, was third with about $13 million. Two horror movies rounded out the Top 5: The Fourth Kind (Universal) earned about $12.5 million while Paranormal Activity (Paramount) drew about $9 million (for about $97 million so far). Also of note, Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire, the Lee Daniels film about an abused teenager in Harlem, grossed $1.8 million from just 18 theaters.",2009-11-08T23:02:24+0000

The city council has even allowed electrical boxes to be used as 3-D canvases for street art. While some of the artists and collectives have achieved a certain visibility in the graffiti world  a local crew called TMD (The Most Def) has won the Write For Gold international competition in Germany for the past two years  many of the taggers are anonymous. And if you want to see their handiwork, youd better be quick. Most of the art (excluding the electrical-box mainstays) is either torn down or painted over within a few days.

The Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said that in 2008 it renewed a three-year agreement with the previous producers of that show, which covered its performers through May 2011, and stipulated that it must be honored if new producers came onto the show. The union said that the producers Kim and Sonny Ricciardi of Broadway Entertainment, which recently took over Tony N Tinas Wedding, paid the musicians for the shows Oct. 10 performance and asked them to learn a new song for Oct. 17. On that date, however, the union said the producers locked the musicians out of the performance space and have denied them access to their instruments and other property. A representative for Local 802 said a meeting had been scheduled for Monday afternoon to address the dispute. A message left at Broadway Entertainment was not immediately returned.

On Wednesday, the city of Copenhagen said that Mr. Eliasson would create a bridge there, called Cirkelbroen (circle bridge), which would provide a winding path across the citys Christianshavns Kanal. In a news release, Mr. Eliasson said the bridge, whose design was inspired by the sailing ships that pass through the canal, would consist of five circular platforms with their own masts. In a statement, he said he hoped the bridge would reduce speed and turn focus. Rather than offering the fastest possible passage across the canal, Mr. Eliasson said, the bridge will create small variations in the way we see the city and open for a renegotiation of public space. The bridge is being given as a gift to Copenhagen from the Nordea-foundation, which promotes healthy living and outdoor activities. It is expected to be completed in 2012 and cost about $6.8 million; Copenhagen is contributing about $1.5 million. ",2009-11-11T18:54:28+0000

He reported that while in a Lausanne hospital that summer, hed read Dantes Inferno, William H. Howes Butterflies of North America and The Original of Laura, the not quite finished manuscript of a novel which I had begun writing and reworking before my illness and which was completed in my mind. In his delirium, he continued, he kept reading it aloud to a small dream audience in a walled garden. My audience consisted of peacocks, pigeons, my long dead parents, two cypresses, several young nurses crouching around, and a family doctor so old as to be almost invisible. Perhaps because of my stumblings and fits of coughing the story of my poor Laura had less success with my listeners than it will have, I hope, with intelligent reviewers when properly published.

Unless we are adding energy artificially (robotics, engines, etc.), these prostheses replace what isnt there. There are ways to test whether they enable competitors to run or to run better than they otherwise might (the unilateral test subjects were chosen precisely because their one natural leg provided a control). When I was a kid, anyone who owned a Guinness Book of World Records will remember the arresting photo of the football player who lacked part of a foot and, with a shoe shaped like a brick, kicked the longest field goal in pro football history.

Fearful that the rocks could be a hazard to the undercarriage of the rover, the engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory stopped trying to extricate it while they studied the situation with a model in a sandbox.

us,Waterfalls Artist to Create a Bridge,"Olafur Eliasson, below, the Danish-Icelandic artist who created the temporary waterfalls in New Yorks East River last year, is at work on a project that will give the residents of another city a different way of looking at a nearby body of water. On Wednesday, the city of Copenhagen said that Mr. Eliasson would create a bridge there, called Cirkelbroen (circle bridge), which would provide a winding path across the citys Christianshavns Kanal. In a news release, Mr. Eliasson said the bridge, whose design was inspired by the sailing ships that pass through the canal, would consist of five circular platforms with their own masts. In a statement Mr. Eliasson said that Rather than offering the fastest possible passage across the canal, the bridge will create small variations in the way we see the city and open for a renegotiation of public space. It is expected to be completed in 2012.",2009-11-13T04:02:55+0000

Turns out the two performers will be working together  and, one assumes, were in cahoots all along. On Thursday, publicists said the two would appear in tandem in a show called All About Me, to be directed by Jerry Zaks and written by Christopher Durang. In a statement, Mr. Feinstein said, I have always been a huge fan of the Dame, and despite our previous friction, now that my mother has forgiven her, I couldnt be more excited to be joining her on Broadway. Dame Edna added, Michael Feinstein is a performer of the highest caliber, I believe, and I couldnt be more than excited to be sharing a Broadway stage with him, in moderation.

A 2004 court ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to go against the wishes of Albert C. Barnes, who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans Court said in the ruling that he considered the move the only viable alternative to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But opponents  a couple dozen of whom protested on Friday morning outside the groundbreaking ceremony, above, waving signs with messages including: Crime Scene. Do Not Enter. Destruction of National Historic Landmark in Progress  contend that the collections financial troubles are surmountable and that the move is motivated primarily by the Philadelphia political establishments desire to generate more downtown tourism.

Mr. Touradji and his firm were accused of using confidential information about Amaranths trading strategy and its positions to unjustly profit.Touradji Capital denied Amaranths allegations, saying that its conduct in assuming the risk of Amaranths base metal portfolio was professional and lawful.Amaranth has received and evaluated additional information regarding the transaction, including trading records and other information voluntarily provided by Touradji Capital, that is consistent with Touradji Capitals position that it did not violate the agreement with Amaranth and did not misuse Amaranths proprietary information, Amaranth said in a statement. Accordingly, Amaranth has withdrawn its summons and notice and elected not to serve a complaint against Touradji Capital.Amaranths decision to withdraw its claims vindicates our position that we acted appropriately and with the utmost of professionalism, Mr. Touradji said in a statement. It also clearly validates our previous statement that the Amaranth suit was based on the misinformation of two disgruntled former employees involved in separate litigation with T.C.M.The two former employees are Robert Vollero and Gentry Beach. The men sued Touradji Capital last December, contending that they were owed $50 million in unpaid bonuses. The hedge fund filed a countersuit against the men this month alleging that the two men had lied about their abilities, stole company secrets and defamed the firm.

A spokesman for the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust said the whisky trove had been found under a hut built at Cape Royds, a promontory on McMurdo Sound, during Mr. Shackletons first South Pole expedition of 1907-9. The expedition ended in failure when the explorer was forced to turn back about 100 miles from the pole. A trust spokesman said the crates and the bottles would undergo conservation work in New Zealand before being returned to the hut, which is being restored as a museum. The spokesman, Al Fastier, said there were no plans to sample the McKinlay & Co. whisky, but the distiller Whyte & Mackay, owner of the brand, said it hoped to acquire a bottle with a view to recreating the century-old blend.

us,Leveraging the Obama Brand," Earlier this month, almost a year from the day when Barack Obama rode the wave of history into Grant Park, he had one of those weeks that makes his presidency seem, at times, so confounding. First Obama endured an electoral embarrassment, watching his party lose off-year gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, in part because many of the voters he had so successfully engaged in his presidential campaign, particularly younger voters, stayed home and made popcorn for Dancing With the Stars instead. The president had been exposed, the pundits solemnly declared, as having no coattails, which are something you really need, they said, if you want congressmen and senators to go along with you on hard votes. Then, just five days later, as Obamas manifest political weakness was still being dissected on cable TV, the president stood in the Rose Garden and hailed the passage in the House of Representatives of the most comprehensive health care bill in the nations history  a bill he had helped pass, narrowly but solidly, by making a rare weekend visit to the Capitol to lobby for it personally. It was, as Obama acknowledged, just a first step, but it was a step no other president had managed to scale, and it seemed to confuse this issue of how powerful a president Obama really is. If Obama has no coattails, then how was he able to pressure nervous lawmakers into making such a perilous vote? And if he had enough influence to get health care reform done, then why were his coattails missing?",2009-11-17T22:01:12+0000

Under the plan the city would lease land to Mr. Broads foundation for a nominal amount and contribute about $1 million for design, construction, parking and other costs.

In his countersuit filed on Nov. 12, The A.P. reported, Mr. Levin said he told Mr. Cage he would need to earn $30 million a year to maintain his life style, and that he warned the actor not to buy castles in England and Bavaria.

Mr. Levin also said in his filing that he devised a fund-raising plan for Mr. Cage that included the sale of a dozen classic cars and a $1.6 million comic book collection. A lawyer for Mr. Cage said that Mr. Levin had breached Mr. Cages privacy by releasing details about his asset sales.

After the announcement of a suite of new energy partnerships between China and the United States, I sought feedback on the electric vehicle project from Lee Schipper, an energy and transportation specialist who splits his time between the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford. Hes quite worried that the program is looking at cars mainly from an energy-efficiency context, instead of how they will shape and affect Chinas fast-expanding cities in a larger sense. Creating a zero-carbon car for China tomorrow wont solve the much bigger problems of urban congestion, traffic fatalities and the paving over of once-beautiful cities to make room for more cars, Dr. Schipper said. The discussions should back up. Energy is only a means to an end. What are the ends, urban access and mobility, or cars for a small minority?",2009-11-19T12:57:02+0000

Perhaps you recall the rampages of the drunken, leering father; the outraged pride of Katerina Ivanovna; the reeking wake of the saintly Father Zosima; or (the grad students choice) the speech of the Grand Inquisitor. The minds retention of plotlines, even those from the pillars of the literary canon, is often selective and uncertain. But heres a different question: What cant you forget? One paragraph has haunted English readers ever since Constance Garnett translated the novel from the Russian in 1912. Grushenka, a passionate fallen woman, tells the tale of a wicked peasant who dies and is dragged by devils into a lake of fire. The peasants guardian angel tries to save her by telling God of the single good deed the woman performed in her lifetime: she once pulled an onion from her garden and gave it to a beggar. Take that onion then, God replies, hold it out to her in the lake, and let her take hold. If the onion doesnt break, God continues, let her come to Paradise. But as the angel draws the peasant out, other sinners cling to her, seeking their own rescue, and she selfishly kicks them away. The onion breaks, and down she sinks. Dostoyevsky didnt invent this anecdote; a peasant told it to him. Lessons like this sometimes seem to emerge whole from the Russian soil, but not every writer has the instincts to grab on and hold tight when they surface. Ludmilla Petrushevskaya does.

Everybody was, you know, obsessed with it, the president said.  Obama has lost his mojo  and cable TV was, 24 hours a day. Do you all remember that? ",2009-11-20T17:10:03+0000

They would also require certain residential building owners to add parking if they modify their buildings.These changes are key to fostering inviting, walkable blocks, the city planning commissioner, Amanda M.

When Mr. McCartney visited his home around the time of the Grammy Awards, Mr. Starr said, I played him this other track and Paul said: Give me the headphones. Give me a pair of cans. And he went to the mike, and he just invented that part where he follows on my vocal. That was all Paul McCartney, and there could be nothing better. The song was written by Van Dyke Parks and Mr. Starr, who added that Mr. McCartneys contribution makes the song like a conversation between us, and that was Pauls idea to do his part one beat behind me.

Mississippi State at Arkansas may not mean much in the larger context of the SEC, but it does give two programs which seem to be improving under relatively new coaches a chance to show where they stand. Kansas States game against Nebraska does matter in the Big 12, though the prize for winning this game will be a date with powerful Texas in the conference title game.

us,"Letters: The Archbishops Blog, Paying for The Times and Bloombergs Blowout","Re The Archbishops Blog (Nov. 8):The explanation for The Timess refusal to publish Archbishop Timothy Dolans letter is lame and defensive, as is the rest of your column. Your argument seems to be that because The Times gave the archbishop a lot of coverage and said some nice things about him when he first came to New York that it can with impunity publish imbalanced and biased articles about the Catholic Church.Likewise, you seem to argue that because some of the religion writers for The Times sometimes write articles that are not considered offensive, this makes the offensive ones O.K. With respect to Maureen Dowd, its difficult to see how The Times sponsors her vitriolic diatribes in general. Her work is short on reason and logic but long on venom and distortion, hardly a contribution to serious public discussion. Its no secret that The Times is steadily losing readership. Remaining in denial about its skewed coverage of the Catholic Church is just the latest example of how badly out of touch with reality the editors and writers for The Times continue to be. I suspect many will find your attempt to defend The Timess record on this matter to be thoroughly unpersuasive.MSGR. MICHAEL FITZGERALDPhiladelphia, Nov. 8, 2009 I write as a Catholic nun who is a daily reader of The Times, and I agree with your conclusion that The Times does not have a pattern of anti-Catholicism. Maureen Dowds column on nuns and the Vatican was compatible with my anger and anguish about the moral crisis in the church. If any group in the U.S. Catholic Church should be investigated, it is the bishops who presided over the pattern of moving troubled priests from parish to parish without disclosure  to parishioners or legal authorities  of actions that potentially constituted sexual abuse and required investigation. In January 2006, The Times wrote an editorial praising a Detroit auxiliary bishop, Thomas Gumbleton, for his advocacy of improved public policies to deal with sexual abuse by priests and others. Subsequent to the publication of this editorial, local church leaders remarked that the supportive editorial was proof that The Times had an anti-Catholic bias. This reactionary critique causes me to infer that the accusation of anti-Catholic bias on the part of The Times is an example of the Catholic Churchs being defensive and protective of itself, not an objective assessment of the attitude of the newspaper. SISTER SUE SATTLER, I.H.M.Detroit, Nov. 8, 2009 The New York Times has no sympathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and, in fact, is institutionally predisposed to find fault with the church wherever and whenever it may be found.The Times does not value churchgoing Roman Catholics as part of its constituency; as a result, we are fair game. The core audience of The Times  secularists, atheists, members of certain politically left-leaning Christian and non-Christian denominations, all enjoy it immensely when The Times uses its pages to kick the church. Archbishop Dolan is correct  other faiths (and, I might add, certain other favored segments of society)  get a bye from the writers and editors of The Times. Who knows? Maybe the Times and its Catholic-baiting political and cultural allies will eventually hound us into shutting down our charities, closing our hospitals, ending our school system and walking away from our colleges. But life in New York and this nation would be much poorer for it.THOMAS J. RICE Manhattan, Nov. 10, 2009  I see nothing in Archbishop Dolans screed that claims the facts of the reporting were wrong. Hes just upset that the wrongs were reported. It is asked: What is fair to report and criticize about the leadership of a religion? Everything is fair to be reported  the good, the bad, and the ugly, as long as the reporting is accurate. Dolan says that Dowd dug deep into the nativist handbook to use every anti-Catholic caricature possible. Virtually every Catholic in the country opposed the nativist anti-Catholic assault of the 19th century, but todays Catholics, on the other hand, support and praise the secular press coverage of the crimes and cover-up of the crimes of Catholic clergy  coverage that is almost totally absent in the Catholic press. Nothing is being reported today that the clergy has not brought on itself. For centuries the Catholic clergy has impressed on the laity the image of a clergy so superior that there slowly emerged the perception of a real ontological difference between the two. Accurate reporting in the secular press about sexual abuse, larcenous pastors stealing millions from their parishes, and now a Vatican investigation of our nuns is rightly tearing down this myth. B.M. BYRNEVienna, Va., Nov. 9, 2009  It is not surprising to me that the Catholic archbishop would see anti-Catholicism in the article by Maureen Dowd, coverage of the pedophilia scandal and other stories that didnt reflect well on Catholics or the Catholic Church. The church is and always has been an authoritarian hierarchy. As such, it is able to prohibit dissent or criticism from members of its hierarchy and, to a great degree, members of its congregations. It is reasonable for an archbishop to conclude that if he cant criticize, no one else should be allowed to either.In a secular, liberal democratic state, the cherished right of freedom of speech includes the right to criticize anybody and everybody. I hope these values persist for a long time to come. I have little hope that religions that depend on blind obedience will embrace them anytime soon.STEPHEN JONESVenice, Fla., Nov. 10, 2009  Im an 84-year-old Catholic who has been reading The Times since I was 17. I cannot agree with Archbishop Dolans outrage over Maureen Dowds column on the attitude of the church toward nuns. Women are just as intelligent and responsible as men. Many of them occupy the top positions in American business and serve in growing numbers in both houses of Congress as well as presidential cabinets. Indeed, one female recently almost achieved the office of president. Whats next  ordained female priests?TERRY ROEWarminster, Pa., Nov. 9, 2009   Re Recession, Revolution and a Leaner Times (Nov. 1):Doubtless the decision about charging online readers is an important one, but seldom are important business decisions arrived at by following a clear consensus. More often, when one finds a clear business consensus, it is often proved wrong and/or late, like American auto companies decision to play down smaller, fuel-efficient cars. No, this is a tough decision that will accurately be made by leadership choosing a path or paths that may appear questionable at the outset, but may be recognized as visionary later.GARY SWAYZEManchester, Mass., Nov. 1, 2009 Come on, throw us a bone here  give those of us who care about The New York Times an opportunity to support it. How about a We Love the NYT coffee mug, an All the News Thats Fit to Print umbrella, an Honorary Times Cub Reporter T-shirt, a Members Only spot on the Web site  you name it, well probably donate to get it.Like many Times supporters, my home page is The New York Times, and I read it (for free) every day. I send articles (for free) to friends and family by e-mail probably once a week. I get the Sunday Times delivered to my Toronto home but I cant justify getting the paper (or any newspaper) every day. But I rely on the kind of reporting that no one but The New York Times is doing, and Id be willing, even thrilled, to support it in the same way I support Minnesota Public Radio, which I listen to (for free) online. Just give me a premium or two and a convenient way to send a hundred bucks or so to keep this kind of journalism alive while it finds a new economic basis for survival.GERSHON SILINSToronto, Nov. 2, 2009  I am among those who hate seeing new organizations die by a thousand self-imposed cuts. At 39, I am on the younger end of the cohort that cant live without newspapers. But my wife and I have already dropped our subscription to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, our local daily, because it has so deconstructed itself that theres no point in paying for it.After the last price increase by The Times, I reluctantly gave up the print edition for Times Reader. It was a difficult decision and a hard adjustment; Id still prefer to handle an actual newspaper, but it made no sense to pay over $800 per year when I can pay $15 per month for the same content. It seems to me that there ought to be something in between. Id obviously be willing to pay far more than $15 per month.I continue to believe that in the long run, the best model for a news organization will be that of a nonprofit, public-service organization. There will always be a readership, an increasingly small and specialized niche for newspapers, but the old business model will not last. In my opinion, The Times should essentially junk its junky free site and develop more along the polished, clean subscription service represented by Times Reader.DAVID TALLMANAtlanta, Nov. 2, 2009 Like other dedicated readers, I am worried. There is so much talk of newsroom cuts and elimination of bureaus and newspaper sections, I open the Sunday Times fearful that some section will be missing, or there will be some subtle change in the quality of the articles. Yesterday I was reminded that change and technological innovation will not necessarily lead to the demise of newspapers. I read The Times using the Times Reader for the first time and I was impressed by how easily I could work my way through in an efficient yet leisurely way  as a Sunday read ought to be. While nytimes.com is useful and a site Ill continue to use, its very different from the experience of actually reading the (print-version) paper. I tend to jump about, depending on what grabs my attention, and I rarely get through the days news. And I find pop-up ads irritating. But why is there no advertising in the Times Reader version of the paper? Wouldnt this be a perfect vehicle for print-style ads (NOT pop-ups!!)? The beauty of in-paper advertising is that it is seen, but if it is of no interest the reader can skip over and ignore it. It does not detract from the pleasure of reading the paper. Old-fashioned, perhaps, but effective. Surely there remain some advertisers out there who would see value in placing their messages here.CHERISSE BANDY Foster, R.I., Nov. 2, 2009 This morning, like every Sunday morning, I went out to the little coffee shop that charges $1 per cup for any size coffee, and picked up my New York Times. Five dollars for the paper is a lot of money for me at the moment  I am 69 years old, have been unemployed for almost a year, and things are very tight. However, not having the Sunday Times is like giving up a part of my history (I grew up in New York, and along with bagels and lox, The Times is Sunday morning), and giving up on the great tradition of print news. So, I pay my $5, buy cheaper food for the cat (just kidding) and enjoy the luxury of Sunday with the Times.Weekdays I mostly catch you online  and for the past few months I have been wondering why you do not charge at least a nominal fee for this service. I would be happy to pay it (Ill tell the cat to eat cake) if that fee would guarantee that the print version of The Times would stay with us. Our country needs real journalists  those guys that hold the governments feet to the fire and protect our interests. I hope you do go ahead with charging for online service, and I hope again to see reporters playing bridge and working crossword puzzles.SHARON RESNICKPrinceton, N.J., Nov. 1, 2009 Why dont you ask for voluntary contributions from online readers? I would be very glad to pay $300 per year. It is wonderful to read the paper here in Edmonton at the same time that someone in New York can. And many of your readers understand well how important investigative journalism is in keeping governments honest.BILL KELLY Edmonton, Alberta, Nov. 1, 2009 I am a faithful reader of The New York Times online, but if it were not free, I would not have become so faithful. I used to go to many different sites to get all the news. Now I start at your site and believe it is by far the best in the United States. My recommendation is to allow a one-year free subscription to new users. Then try to keep the yearly charge as low as possible to encourage the widest readership. Like the woman in your column, I have my credit card ready. STEVE MARTIN Seattle, Nov. 1, 2009 I encourage the debate on charging for The Times online, which The Wall Street Journal and The Economist are doing. But I have a problem if a subscription Web presence will still involve cookies and the related spying on my Web activity. I have debated this with people at The Times and The Economist.The Times suggests that the cookies make the Web easier to use. But there is nothing in the cookies I found that improves my Web experience; many of them are tracking cookies that allow someone to build a marketable profile of me.The argument in your column is that millions of online advertising dollars are at stake if charging for access reduces the number of viewers. That may be, but the advertisers should be aware that many Web users, like myself, do not allow cookies and work diligently to avoid any tracking. And a growing number of Web users are learning about tracking and how to block the intrusion into personal privacy.The decision to charge or not is, in my view, a decision on the long-term survival of The Times. I am concerned that in time the loss of print revenue will force the online version to support more and more of the papers operations. My larger concern is that the work of powerful newspapers  in keeping our governments and corporations in line with investigative reporting  will disappear without a decent revenue stream to pay the costs of such reporting. So I am willing to pay for access to a robust online New York Times, but I am not willing to surrender my privacy to get it.RAYMOND C. GRAYEaston, Pa., Nov. 1, 2009  Re About That Bloomberg Runaway (Nov. 15):  Your column suggests the correct and inescapable point that polls can serve as self-fulfilling prophecies, discouraging those who would otherwise vote if the polls were more promising for their candidates. The important point left out, however, is that pollsters should ask directly regarding the intensity of support for candidates, rather than relying on whether respondents may change their minds. That is a good question, but it is no substitute for also inquiring about how strongly poll respondents support specific candidates. If all polls asked about both the strength of support and the likelihood of voters changing their minds, fewer large disparities between poll support and election support would occur.RICHARD E.

This new incarnation of Carnage grossed $497,779 last week, compared with $1,107,302 the previous week. The audience attendance last week was only 63 percent of capacity. Still, last weeks gross was among the largest for a play on Broadway (and bigger than grosses for some musicals last week).

Mr. Temime, who has represented Mr. Polanski in other matters, told Le Figaro newspaper last week that Mr. Polanski would not return voluntarily to the United States, which he fled in 1978 before sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. But three American lawyers who represent Mr. Polanski  Chad Hummel, Bart Dalton and Douglas Dalton  responded with a statement disavowing any statements by lawyers in France who purport to speak for Mr. Polanski. They said that only they and a Swiss lawyer, Lorenz Erni, represent Mr. Polanski in the case against him and in the Swiss extradition proceeding. Any statements made in the press to the effect that Mr. Polanski will not accept lawful orders of the courts, including relating to extradition, are not true, the lawyers said in their statement.

The court considered the bail and the supporting measures as being sufficient to avert the risk of flight, it said.

I would argue that this weekend of college games is more like the turducken, a complex and multi-layered Russian doll of food, that never fails to surprise with its confusing flavor juxtapositions and horrific caloric implications.

The Justice Ministry had 10 days to submit an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, but said on Thursday that it had decided not to.

Ken Auletta, the author of this absorbing, shaggy, name-droppy book, doesnt seem to like either of them much  he says that Page has a Kermit the Frog voice, which isnt nice, while Brin comes off as a swaggering, efficiency-obsessed overachiever who, at Stanford, aced tests, picked locks, borrowed computer equipment from the loading dock and once renumbered all the rooms in the computer science building. Googles leaders are not cold businessmen; they are cold engineers, Auletta writes  but cold seems oddly wrong. Aulettas own chilliness may be traceable in part to Brins and Pages reluctance to be interviewed. After months of my kicking at the door, they opened it, he writes in the acknowledgments. Googles founders and many of its executives share a zeal to digitize books, he observes, but dont have much interest in reading them. ",2009-11-27T17:34:29+0000

us,Please Mr. Postman,"Sometimes you write an elegy without meaning to. In the early 1990s, when Thomas Mallon began his book on people and their letters, you were marveling at your spiffy new dial-up modem, if you so much as knew what one was. His fine meditation on the art of letter-writing  he intended it as a companion to A Book of Ones Own, his study of people and their diaries  naturally reads differently today: The very physics of our universe, Mallon notes, have fundamentally altered. Time and distance are no longer what they once were. With them have gone, to varying degrees, privacy, eccentricity, suspense, your local stationer and, very nearly, the United States Postal Service.

One child will flail about with scissors, another must bite or shove, and theres always the pulling of hair or the tearing of skin. Someone will decide to experiment with matches or lock the door of a dark closet and abandon the sister cowering inside. A grown-up might pretend to be a lion and roar so hard that a child wets himself in panic. Banal but terrifying things happen. Then we forget them. Somehow, though, they dont forget us. Memories lie buried, yet remain forceful enough to shape our lives. In its infinite dimensions, this is the subject Penelope Lively, the British author of more than two dozen childrens books and numerous adult novels, has explored throughout her long and impressive career. In her haunting new novel, Family Album, the act of forgetting is as strange and interesting as the power of remembering. ",2009-11-27T17:50:28+0000

When I was studying in Taiwan in the late 1950s, then-President Chiang was regarded by most of the Western students on the island  and many of the Chinese as well  as the remote, cruel man who lost China; his wife was the austere, once-glamorous Dragon Lady who had helped him lose it. Although Chiang alone, or both Chiangs, had appeared numerous times on the cover of Time magazine, those illustrious days seemed over. But now that Jay Taylor has written his comprehensive book The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China, we are able to see Chiang as a man of considerable cunning, brutality and patience who skillfully played a weak hand against the Japanese and Maos forces while extracting huge sums from the Americans. Similarly, in her latest biography, The Last Empress, Hannah Pakula presents Madame Chiang as far more complex, awful and brilliant than we had imagined. ",2009-11-27T19:13:56+0000

But Sultanahmet is a center of the citys religious life and home to many of its most observant citizens. During Ramadan, it is the site of a vast public picnic, where hundreds of Turks break the fast every night. This year I saw conservative ladies sitting cross-legged on the grass with pizza boxes, and nonreligious people munching cheap kebabs and humming to live Turkish bands. It felt so much like an American county fair, I half expected to see face-painting booths.

The wares were cool and the shoppers even cooler: off the charts in hip per square inch. Tucked away in a corner among all the old favorites was a booth whose name I didnt recognize. I went in for a closer look after spotting some camel toggle coats from Gloverall and heavy knit cardigans from the obscure Danish seafaring knitting company SNS Herning. The stand belonged to a brand new online-only mens-wear shop called CHCM, which stands for Clinton Hill Classic Menswear.

At issue is a video package that was used to introduce the interview with Mr. Lambert, the American Idol finalist who gave a sexually charged performance at the American Music Awards on Sunday. When CBS rebroadcast a clip from that show, it blurred a scene of Mr. Lambert kissing his male keyboardist. But it did not blur a scene of Madonna and Britney Spears kissing at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. In a statement, Jarrett Barrios, the president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said, I would have hoped CBS would provide the same treatment for images of gay and lesbian people and not create an unfair double standard that treats our community differently.

Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado, Boulder, said he was told differently as recently as August. (Realclimate.org posted the locations of various data sets.) He credited the university and climate center for moving now to be clearer about the data archives and to provide more access. When the data is available in its original form those skeptical of climate science can then do the temperature math themselves out in the open where everyone can see their work, Dr. Pielke wrote on Sunday. If the global numbers come out as CRU has presented over the years, then it will strike a blow to skepticism about global temperature trend records produced by CRU and restore a good deal of credibility to this area of climate science.",2009-11-30T12:35:45+0000

The Monster Ball aint Gypsy,  Mr. Nestruck writes.

They may sell for hundreds of dollars in swank boutiques from Boston to Buenos Aires, but it must be remembered that they originated as work wear for 19th-century laborers who valued them not for their color or silhouette but for their riveted ruggedness. Cowboy hats, truckers wallets, nylon windbreakers and Converse high-tops, to mention just a random sampling of the wearable artifacts that have come to define our nations aesthetic, were inspired by necessity rather than an intent to catch the eye. Design for designs sake, our history suggests, is not an American priority. Instead, we design things to do a certain job (whether its in a mine, an office or a basketball arena), and when we devise a solution to the challenge, especially one thats ingenious, simple or cheap, the result is a forward leap in style that may not even seem like one at first.

The Made in Heaven producers said last Wednesday that their contract with the Soho Playhouse gave them the discretion to close down their show after giving four weeks notice. But on Monday, they said they would close the show after its Dec. 7 performance. In a statement, Barbara Ligeti, the lead producer of Made in Heaven, said, We agonized over this decision, adding: The Soho Playhouse made us a very favorable offer, and we felt that sparring with them, to the detriment of the Irish Reps wonderful production, would be counterproductive and mean-spirited.
