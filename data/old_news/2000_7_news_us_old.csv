Route 66 was commissioned in 1926, fully paved in 1938, its last stretch replaced by an Interstate in 1984. During the Depression and World War II, it was a historic migratory corridor from the Midwest to the Southwest and California. In ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' John Steinbeck called Route 66 ''the mother road'' but also, more accurately, ''the road of flight.'' It was the road across ''the Western States,'' a road on which no one ever traveled east, on which caravans of drifters and laborers and uprooted families moved in the one iconic direction, toward the Pacific Ocean. ''Need,'' Steinbeck wrote, ''is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.'' The action that grew up along Route 66 during its boom years is legendary. That was where, and how, America learned what it means to be on the road with an automobile. Every motel, every auto camp, every drive-in along the way was somebody's pipe dream come true, and the road ahead was a pipe dream, too. The highway followed the lay of the land.

After I noticed the other characters in the film address this fellow first as ''Mr. Grossmith'' and then as ''George,'' the penny dropped: Why, that must be George Grossmith -- the man who, after chucking his career with Gilbert and Sullivan, went on to write a book that I cherish above all others, a book that I have repeatedly rejoiced in reading, a book that has been my prop and stay in troubled times: ''The Diary of a Nobody.''",2000-07-02T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Swedesboro; The Are the Egg Men,"I wondered how Swedesboro got its name -- for about 12 seconds. Then I saw the giant sign proclaiming that Swedes settled the town in 1638. Just below, I read of visits from Swedish royalty: Prince Bertil in 1938, and King Carl XVI Gustaf in 1976. I must admit, I was intimidated by the Swedish pedigree. My only brushes with the culture's cuisine have been Swedish meatballs and . . . . So it was with great relief that I stumbled upon Rode's Fireside, an old-fashioned American family restaurant. Within the unassuming exterior is a surprisingly spacious room, with ample tables and a large bar. (Covered outdoor seating is also available.) Above you are Tiffany lamps, ceiling fans, and hanging plants; below is a hardwood floor. And there's a big fireplace. After all, this isn't Rode's Space Heater Restaurant. I sat at the bar, because that is what lonely men do when they find themselves in Swedesboro on a Sunday afternoon. The wait staff, identically dressed in light red shirts, dark red aprons and khakis (I was assured this was not the national costume of Sweden), were all friendly and attentive. Like any self-respecting Pennsylvania border-town bar, Rode's offers Yuengling lager on tap. It nicely complemented an Old Hickory dhicken sandwich -- a juicy chicken breast, topped with cheddar, barbecue sauce and succulent bacon. But it's not just sandwiches; Rode's serves a full slate of pasta, steak, chicken, and seafood entrees, priced from $8.95 to $17.95. I saw a ''Fresh Eggs'' sign on the wall, and thought to myself, that it was one of those phony down-home decorations you see in T.G.I. Friday's. But back in the parking lot, I noticed a truck: ''Otto C. Rode Inc., Farm Fresh Butter & Eggs, established 1880.'''What can I say? T.G.I.Rode. JACK SILBERT",2000-07-02T05:00:00+0000

With a voice as pure and sweet as an ebony virgin locked in an ivory tower -- and the glamour and vanity to match -- Diana Ross led the Motown trio to the top of the charts 10 times in less than three years. In 1967 she became the headliner, and three years later, Diana Ross and the Supremes made their farewell appearance at the Frontier in Las Vegas, singing their final No. 1 hit. It was an end-of-the-affair, gospel-styled swan song filled with regret and hope and titled ''Someday We'll Be Together.''

What followed is a tale of other determined lawyers, secret informers (one is called Deep Cough) and scientists willing to tell the truth about the tobacco companies who had employed them. Many of these people received death threats, and some scientists were advised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check their cars for bombs every morning.

The college mourns the loss of this distinguished architect, teacher, humanist and friend, who until his recent retirement had been professionally associated with the school for a half-century. A Cooper Union graduate, John Hejduk devoted his life to advancing the theory and practice of the architectural art through education and personal influence, offering his talents in a variety of forms. Through his drawings, his theoretical work, his poetry and particularly his example, John Hejduk demonstrated to those around him the profound significance of the relationship between humanity and the structures it builds for its own home. His work will continue to guide generations of students and professionals, and his spirit and accomplishment will continue to grace the halls of the school to which he made such a significant and unparalleled contribution. The entire Cooper Union community offers its deepest condolences to the Hejduk family. Dr. George Campbell Jr., President John Jay Iselin, President Emeritus Robert A.

Yet, water burbling down aluminum runnels (next to bottom, right) and a grove of bamboo trees, planted last year, below, make the space sensuous. From top to bottom, right, Mr. Smith created a rooftop terrace overlooking the garden. Aluminum screens gleam in the sunlight, while aluminum mixing bowls ($69 from R-S Restaurant Equipment on the Bowery) have become planters for boxwood and holly.

In addition to his duties as a television journalist, he has a fiction habit that has produced several down-home comic novels, a Beltway thriller, a high-concept political campaign caper, a C.I.A. confection and now, in his 12th, THE SPECIAL PRISONER (Random House, $23.95), a serious and well-researched moral inquiry. Is homicide ever justifiable? In the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, John Quincy Watson, the 71-year-old retired Methodist bishop of San Antonio, recognizes the eyes of ''the Hyena'' -- the man who, half a century earlier, had tortured him in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Watson follows the man, whose name on the airline manifest is Tashimoto, on the next flight to San Diego, finds his hotel and knocks on the door of room 1808. In alternating chapters the reader learns about Watson's brief, youthful service as a pilot during World War II and his harrowing experiences as a P.O.W., his postwar marriage to the nurse who accepted what torture had done to his ''basic equipment,'' his religious vocation and sustaining friendship with a few fellow survivors of that terrible camp. Those episodes are woven around the hotel room confrontation, the death of Bill Joe Tashimoto and the eventual murder trial. Before Watson is judged, the reader is asked to consider issues of wartime behavior, survivor's guilt, peacetime resolution and the notion of self-defense. Lehrer's research shows. There are even explicit bibliographic references to the important texts about Japanese war crimes, background surely for the carefully plotted set pieces. ''The Special Prisoner'' feels more like a study for the heir to the ''well-made play'' -- the well-made-for-television movie. Lehrer's book is worthy and wanting at the same time.

But THE RED ROSE GIRLS: An Uncommon Story of Art and Love (Abrams, $39.95), by Alice A. Carter, tells how Jesse Willcox Smith (1863-1935), Elizabeth Shippen Green (1871-1954) and Violet Oakley (1874-1961) became extremely successful illustrators for books and magazines, working in a profession largely dominated by men. They forged an unconventional communal relationship based on passion for their art and love for one another. Under the mentorship of their teacher, the illustrator Howard Pyle, they earned commissions from the nation's most prestigious periodicals, including Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. (Oakley's paintings now hang in the Pennsylvania state capitol.) Carter, who teaches illustration in the School of Art and Design at San Jose State University, elegantly describes their emotional bond and the factors that caused it to end (one of the women married). Along with their friend Henrietta Cozens, they set up a household at Philadelphia's picturesque Red Rose Inn and called themselves the ''Cogs family,'' a name formed from the initial letters of each of their surnames. In their genteel way these women were rebels, and yet their story, often lyrically romantic, and their resolutely stylized illustrations (beautifully reproduced) were the epitome of respectability.

Born of Israel and Ann Sack in Lynn, Massachusetts, March 6, 1911. Graduated Boston Latin School Class of 1928. Graduated Dartmouth College, Class of 1932. Magna cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. He entered the family business to join his illustrious father Israel Sack in 1933. Israel Sack had established an enviable reputation as the Dean of American antiques during his Boston career. To revive the family business during the Depression, Harold Sack took charge as President and CEO. During his career in this capacity, he formed many major, private collections of Americana in whole or in part and masterpieces to the Metropolitan Museum and other museums. He headed the donation of the Israel Sack Galleries in the Metropolitan Museum and gave installation to the Hood Museum in Dartmouth as well as the Art Institute of Chicago. He served as the trusted adviser to Clem Conger in forming the Diplomatic Reception Rooms in the Department of State. Harold Sack and Lawrence Fleischman founded and chaired the Channel 13 auctions, which earned millions for Public Television. He served as Trustee in the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Museum had a special ceremony to honor his service. Together with his brothers Albert and Robert the firm Israel Sack, Inc. maintained the tradition set by Israel Sack and were to a great extent responsible for the present recognition of the importance of American furniture contributions. He lectured extensively and many of his articles were published in Antiques Magazine and elsewhere. His book: American Treasure Hunt, the Legend of Israel Sack and his contributions to the 10 Volumes of American Antiques from the Israel Sack Collection number his contributions. In 1996, Israel Sack and sons, Harold, Albert & Robert received the prestigious Henry F. duPont Award for outstanding achievement in this field, the only time this award was offered to a dealer. In 1989 he purchased at auction the Nicolas Brown desk and bookcase for 12.1 million dollars. This was the highest price paid at that time for any work of art outside of a painting. He leaves a devoted wife, Lauretta. Four sons: Dr. Kenneth Sack (Tiburon, CA), David Sack (Pearland, TX), Michael Sack (Philadelphia, PA) and Dr. Daniel Sack, (New York City). Two brothers: Albert Sack (New York City) and Robert Sack (Ossining, NY). Eight grandchildren: Darren, Jeffery, Elizabeth, Allison, Jennifer, Jacob, Myra and Leah. He leaves a legacy to future generations that will carry the banner of Americana. His warmth, his integrity, and the affection he inspired in those whose lives he touched matched his contributions.

An attorney in private practice Mr. Amgott was active in New York State government and politics for decades. He served briefly as Assistant Attorney General of New York State or ''Attorney Colonel'' as he liked to say. He was counsel to several committees of the State Assembly and drafted the current statutes on eminent domain, the rights of mental health patients and the state's 5-cent deposit on cans and bottles. He was a longtime member of the Liberal Party. Mr. Amgott primarily represented writers including Robert Ludlum, Eric Van Lustbader and Donald E. Westlake, who dedicated his novel ''The Hot Rock'' to ''Milt Amgott, who helped keep me from a life of crime by making it superfluous.'' He also represented many science fiction writers including James Blish and Theodore Sturgeon. He loved words above all. In addition to writing laws and contracts for a living, he spoke several languages including Serbo-Croatian and Middle English, enjoyed mysteries and the late work of James Joyce, and inked in the New York Times crossword every day. During W.W. II he served in the Army preparing intelligence reports and debriefing German prisoners. He landed on D Day at Utah Beach carrying two typewriters and no rifle. Mr. Amgott graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University and received law degrees from NYU and Brooklyn Law School. He was born in New York City on August 13, 1918, the son of Meyer and Rose Kaminicker Amgott.

Jan Karski was a diplomat, a Righteous Gentile, a messenger for the Polish underground resistance during World War II, and an eyewitness to the systematic Nazi extermination of the Jews in Poland. He risked his own life to report the unimaginable atrocities he had seen to the Polish, British and American governments and to plead for help in saving Jewish lives. Modestly referring to himself as a ''human tape recorder'', he was, in actuality, a trumpet, heralding the harsh tones of human indifference and cruelty while at the same time personifying the indomitable spirit and inherent goodness that mankind can still possess. He devoted his postwar life to protecting the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, combating anti-Semitism and intolerance, and advancing the cause of human rights.

In her monologues, the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred to the point that you begin to wonder if even she knows the difference between the two. (She does.) When she sings in a two-tiered voice that has several layers of affectation, it's often hard to tell whether she's putting us on or whether she envisages herself as a combination of Dusty Springfield and Janis Joplin, two singers to whom she pays tribute in her fascinating new cabaret show, ''Songs I Sang on the Kibbutz.''",2000-07-14T05:00:00+0000

In March, after months of friction, the board of the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance dismissed Ron Protas, the legal heir to Graham's work, as artistic director and a board member. In turn, Mr. Protas has refused to allow the Martha Graham Dance Company to stage her works, though he has licensed them to other performing groups. This week, in response, the Martha Graham Dance Company issued a public letter, signed by nearly every notable person in the dance world, urging other companies not to perform Graham's works until the company reaches agreement with Mr. Protas.

But the humans at Pets.com were not prepared for the aftermath of the puppet's spot broadcast during the Super Bowl in January. Traffic on the site that day more than doubled from the previous Sunday's. Some 10,000 Sock fans a month were asking by e-mail and phone, Does the Sock Puppet do weddings, birthday parties, interviews? And most of all, Where can I buy one? Fans were disappointed to learn that the Sock Puppet, who is rumored to have escaped from a washing machine, was not available for sale, rent or bar mitzvahs. No longer. In February, Pets.com auctioned one of the puppets on Amazon.com Auctions for $21,100, which was donated to Pets.commitment, a philanthropic program.

Its northern section, known as Short Hills, gives its name to an upscale shopping center, the Mall at Short Hills. The residential area of Short Hills is characterized by winding, hilly roads, bordered by thick stands of oaks. Behind them, often shielded from public view by sumptuous flower gardens, are some of the country's best examples of 19th-century residential architecture. The rest of the town, known as the Millburn section, is laid out more conventionally, with neat streets and a mixture of building styles -- small turn-of-the-century workers' houses, Victorians, Tudors, Cape Cods and 1950's ranches and colonials -- on smaller lots, some just 36 feet wide.",2000-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Deborah Willis, curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian's Center for African-American History and Culture in Washington, has spent much of her career recovering the work of black photographers and trying to redress widespread ignorance of their accomplishments. REFLECTIONS IN BLACK: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present (Norton, $50), a historical and biographical survey with nearly 600 reproductions, is her latest effort toward this goal. Black Americans have produced photographs since the emergence of the daguerreotype, which was introduced in New Orleans by a free man of color named Jules Lion. Photography has always been practiced as a business, no less so by blacks who set up daguerreotype studios in cities or practiced their craft as itinerants. One notable example was J. P. Ball, a photographer and entrepreneur who established a large and successful portrait business in Cincinnati in the 1850's and won national recognition with his antislavery panoramas. Every style from the classic to avant-garde is represented in this book, and virtually every subject, including civil rights, spirituality, celebrity, culture and identity. Scenes of family life recur, ranging in tone from Allen E. Cole's rather stilted tableau of the 1930's, ''Home of Mrs. H. H. Sink,'' to the image of a mother-daughter face-off over the kitchen table by the contemporary photographer Carrie Mae Weems.

Lately hardly a week goes by without news that yet another American business icon has become part of a foreign-based corporate empire. Some of the acquirees are the very companies that in the past tried to use their all-American identity as a marketing tool. For example, in the days of Lee Iacocca, Chrysler tried to convince people that there was something patriotic about buying mediocre cars festooned with chrome and simulated wood paneling. But now the minivan has married the Mercedes: Chrysler has become the junior partner in DaimlerChrysler. Seagram (strictly speaking a Canadian company, but with its center of gravity well south of the border) is being absorbed by the French firm Vivendi. And most recently, Union Bank of Switzerland has announced that it is acquiring PaineWebber -- that symbol of America's belief that it is both possible and good to become rich.",2000-07-16T05:00:00+0000

But spokesmen for the tobacco companies quickly predicted that the sheer size of the award, which they said they could not pay, would make it untenable. Philip Morris Inc. was ordered to pay the largest amount, $73.96 billion; the other defendants were the Lorillard Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco, the R. J.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Last Words, Sort Of","When someone takes his own life, it's tempting to interpret everything he did and said near the end as a kind of warning. Such compulsive reductionism is particularly difficult to avoid in reading AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN: A Journey (St. Martin's, $17.95), a book-length work Richard Brautigan completed a year before his suicide in 1984. In it, Brautigan creates what he calls ''a calendar of one man's journey during a few months in his life'' that, though labeled as fiction by its publisher, reads like memoir. The title refers to a friend who had killed herself and whose absence is the book's organizing force. Under the shadow of this event, Brautigan's familiar mix of wry stories and observations takes on a persistent mordancy. There are certainly moments here when he revels in the absurd, as when he relates his determination, while visiting Hawaii, to pose for a photo with a chicken. More often, though, he adopts a subdued tone that will surprise fans of his famously playful novels. After devoting so much thought to the question of individual freedom in a corrupt world, Brautigan seems here to concede, finally, that some things are inescapable. He dedicates his introduction to another friend who had recently died from cancer. It's possible to read countless other elements of the book as intimations of mortality, from Brautigan's compulsive traveling to his habit of concluding many sections with a date and the word ''finished.'' But just as evident, though overshadowed by subsequent events, is the author's determination to resist the bleak certitude of death. ''Life cannot be controlled and perhaps not even envisioned and . . . design and portent are out of the question,'' he notes at one point.

One of Mitchell's sources, an exterminator, estimated that the number of rats in the city had dropped from two per person around 1920 to one per person in the early 1940's, largely because of a reduction in horses and changes in construction. Since then, one rat per person in New York has come to seem like gospel.",2000-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Harbor View's agreement with the village expired in May, and the village board had hoped to grant a contract for new courts and a multisport center to Sportime, a Long Island company. The village had argued that Harbor View, which has operated the courts since 1978, lacked the money and experience to build the center.

Jan Karski was a diplomat, a Righteous Gentile, a messenger for the Polish underground resistance during World War II, and an eyewitness to the systematic Nazi extermination of the Jews in Poland. He risked his own life to report the unimaginable atrocities he had seen to the Polish, British and American governments and to plead for help in saving Jewish lives. Modestly referring to himself as a ''human tape recorder'', he was, in actuality, a trumpet, heralding the harsh tones of human indifference and cruelty, while at the same time personifying the indomitable spirit and inherent goodness that mankind can still possess. He devoted his postwar life to protecting the memory of the victims of the Holocaust, combating anti-Semitism and intolerance, and advancing the cause of human rights. In 1993, the AJC bestowed our highest honor on Jan Karski, and in 1999, he was the first recipient of the Eternal Light Award from the Center for Catholic/Jewish Studies, a collaboration of AJC and Saint Leo University. With great sorrow we now bid farewell to a dear frienda gentleman and a gentle man of enormous personal courage and profound moral integrity. We will cherish his memory as near to our hearts as he cradled the souls of the millions of Jews he never knew but tried to rescue. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A.

Moreover, if ever there was a time of year to try poaching a whole fish (the subject for this lesson) or roasting one (next time) this is it.

Forgettable, virtually interchangeable movies like ''She's All That,'' ''Whatever It Takes'' and the nondance parts of ''Center Stage'' operate on the disastrous assumption that since young love is trivial, stories about it can be flimsy and secondhand. But movies about adolescent longing (as distinct, for the sake of argument, from adolescent lust) are the culture's last vital link to the great studio comedies of the 1930's. If this proposition seems laughable, that's because, owing to the cynicism and laziness of filmmakers and production executives, the genre has been bled dry of its innocence, its charm and its essential seriousness.",2000-07-21T05:00:00+0000

Clinton had already signed an executive order back in February, banning such discrimination for federal employees. True to form, both politicians had polling data to support them. A 1998 survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans found that 63 percent of them balked at any genetic testing if an employer or health insurer could have access to the data.

Nestled in a cozy Indian restaurant, her tales flow like the Ganges itself: There's the one about the snake charmer who wouldn't let him take his picture unless she gave him 100 rupees. Or the one about the elephant guide who charged her pennies to ride his lumbering pachyderm down a canyon, and a hundred times that to get back up. And Helen's description of the Taj Mahal -- a shimmering marble jewel in a sea of poverty -- is likely to move one to tears. The backdrop for her latest reverie proved equally powerful. Karma Kafe, a stylish ''Indian bistro'' owned by Mehernosh Daroowalla, host of the more traditional India on the Hudson in the Mile Square City, offers a nifty seven-day-a-week lunch special for budget-minded folks who hate fussing with menus. Only $8.95 and you eat for as long as you can take the heat. Gurmeej Singh, the chef, has assembled the perfect sampler of popular dishes: tandoori chicken, saag paneer (creamed spinach cooked gently with Singh's handmade cottage cheese cubes), dal tandoori (hot lentil sauce) to spoon over your pea-and-rice pulao. There's chicken curry, peas and potatoes, and plenty of naan to sop it all up, not to mention a bowlful of dill yogurt to cool your palate for dessert. That dessert'll be extra, big spender, but worth the splurge. The regular menu offers Indian dishes for us chic western types: tandoori wraps and crawfish vindaloo, anyone? There's a hip-looking bar, a window seat, and a televison that, alas, does not broadcast classics from Indian cinema.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Moods of the Rich and Famous,"What is most striking about the celebrity portraits that Arnold Newman photographed for Life, Look and other magazines is their elegant simplicity. As shown in ARNOLD NEWMAN (Taschen, $39.99), the photographer has focused his camera primarily on artists, writers and political figures for the past 60 years. He usually captures his famous subjects with revealing backgrounds or telling compositions. A pensive Stravinsky is seated at a grand piano that dwarfs the composer as its raised lid resembles an abstract sculpture of a musical note. Poised on a sofa with wide stripes -- and matching wallpaper -- an amused Diana Vreeland makes her fashion statement with a robe that clashes, yet oddly complements the pattern. Robert Moses is depicted standing messianically on a steel beam suspended over the East River, with blueprints in hand and the Manhattan skyline as backdrop. As if to remind us that photography is, in a sense, painting with a newfangled brush, Newman had several artists pose with an easel or a blank canvas framing their heads, including Mondrian, de Chirico, Man Ray, Georgia O'Keeffe and Hans Hofmann. Recent photos of Woody Allen and President Clinton testify that Newman has lost none of his skill for apprehending an inner mood with an outer expression. David Kaufman",2000-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; An Offshore Farce,"Everything about William Monahan's assured first novel, LIGHT HOUSE: A Trifle (Riverhead, $21.95), is tremendously knowing. Tim Picasso -- the beautiful, brilliant, insipid hero -- has become a drug runner because he is too talented and uncompromising to make it in the commercial art world. A brief life of crime ensues; Picasso steals from the wrong man, a gangster named Jesus Castro, and then hides out at the Admiral Benbow Inn off the coast of Massachusetts. We meet a satisfyingly ridiculous cast of characters, including Prof. Menelaus G. Eggman, who is ''flickering at the edge of literary relevancy'' and holding a writing seminar, and a bitter, failed writer named Glowery (''the sort of damaged marginal that the magazines troll for in catch-and-release experiments'') who is en route but gets stuck in a bar dressed as a pirate. The fantastically inarticulate Jesus Castro shows up, followed by a dominatrix and some henchmen, while a crusty old New Englander tries to escape the house of the title. ''Light House'' is a sort of old English farce that allows Monahan, formerly an editor at Spy magazine, to skewer whatever comes to mind: modern art, magazine writing, education, the young. But the setting is pervasive and rendered with immediacy. The book is also very funny, and Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along. ''Lighthouse'' is an antidote to everything it rails against.

Anderson is 46 and worth almost a billion dollars. He lives in Washington -- the city he grew up in, a city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it, ''personal'' -- in an apartment adorned with a painting he commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ''I am still just a rat in a cage.'' ''That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ''rats in a cage. And we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a 30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The cage Anderson refers to is the planet earth itself, and he has taken it upon himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to finance the International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to found the Space Frontier Foundation; in 1994, $5 million to start the Foundation for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and between 1996 and 1999, $40 million to build the Roton, a manned, reusable spaceship. Then a few months ago, in one of his eriodic calls to me, he rang me up: ''I'm in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging for a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.",2000-07-23T05:00:00+0000

After the war, he became one of the first employees of Brookhaven National Laboratory. He retired from the Lab in 1981 as Personnel Director.

In particular, he achieved great racing success in the Star class, winning several regional and national trophies.

Mr. Gibson was charged along with Camille Savoca, vice president of his Gibson Associates firm and William Bernowich, the firm's project manager on the troubled and much investigated Irvington job.

us,The Ingratiator,"Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, is post-everything. Born in 1958, he came along too late to be influenced by the civil rights struggle, the Vietnam War, the 60's, Watergate. The first presidential campaign Lazio volunteered to work on was Gerald Ford's in 1976. This is not just a matter of historical curiosity. Our political life is dominated by figures who came of age in the 60's and whose views bear the mark of these great events, just as the outlook of preceding generations was shaped by the cold war, World War II and the Depression. Think of Hillary Clinton, Lazio's opponent, who was born into a Midwestern Republican family and whose complacent sense of the order of things was upended by the liberal social gospel of her Methodist church. Even Gov. George Pataki, a genial Republican who is an ally of Lazio's -- and with whom Lazio is often compared -- became a Goldwater conservative in the 60's.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Too Big for Thinking,"There are about 100 billion galaxies in the universe, each with about 100 billion stars. It would take 10,000 years to tally them if every human being on earth counted them at the rate of five per second. Sounds crowded out there, right? Yet if the solar system were the size of a coffee cup, the Milky Way would be as big as North America. And if you could collapse the Milky Way into that cup, the nearest sizable galaxy, Andromeda, would drift in space about seven feet away. Here's the capper: there is less than one atom per cubic yard floating in intergalactic space, while on earth one cubic yard of air holds about 50 trillion trillion atoms. These are among the mind-blowing revelations in ONE UNIVERSE: At Home in the Cosmos (Joseph Henry/National Academy Press, $40), an insightful primer on all things great and small. Loosely organized around the three basic principles driving the universe -- motion, matter and energy -- the book features crisp, rarely patronizing writing to describe the current state of knowledge of everything from the tiniest subatomic particles (with exotic names like fermions, bosons and leptoquarks) to superstring theory and other ''grand unified theories'' that seek to meld cosmic forces with the principles of quantum mechanics. The authors (Neil de Grasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium, Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History, and Robert Irion, a science journalist) employ everyday analogies to explain the four basic forces of nature -- gravity, electromagnetism and the ''strong'' and ''weak'' forces at play in an atom's nucleus -- and the many fascinating ways these building blocks manifest themselves and interact. There are many helpful illustrations and color photographs, notably a riveting two-page photo showing a long string of burning fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 being pulled to the roiling surface of Jupiter. What's most refreshing about this road trip through the heavens is the humility of its authors in the face of so much that is unknowable or dimly understood, even as they patiently but eloquently provide one-stop shopping for students of the cosmos.

In this candid behind-the-scenes photo, he caught a quiet moment between Cooper Witte and Yasmine Alfakey, in sunglasses, who has on a Barbie shirt ($19.50) and Tina Neumann pants ($70).2. We also learned that kids don't look at labels; adults do. And for those who care, Gucci has introduced Gucci Baby, a new line of luxe children's clothing. Now you can bring your newborn home from the hospital wearing (a) booties with the double-G logo. From $90 to $165. Or for cold nights in Aspen, try (b) a white mink coat ($4,250). Or deck your kid out in (c) black canvas and leather (biker jacket, $995, and pants, $295) to minimize damage if he falls off his Razor scooter. (All at select Gucci stores.) Prada is also expanding its line to include (d) sports shoes for children. Five styles will be available at Barneys New York, Neiman Marcus and most Prada stores in November. The price range is $130 to $160, so under-age Prada junkies -- the few who do label-watch -- should start saving their allowance now.3. Some camera representatives have a lot of patience. Ray Acevedo was dispatched by Olympus to help teach the kids how to use the C3030 Zoom digital. Even our littlest photographer, Messiah Bailey (a), a mere 4, picked it up. Cameras ($999.99) were loaded with 64 MB Smartmedia cards ($179) and set at Super High Quality (SHQ-jpeg), allowing the kids to take 27 photos before having to download. All in all, Acevedo downloaded about 450 photographs -- roughly the same amount generated by a normal fashion shoot. Since there were only two C3030's (along with Smartmedia cards, available at Alkit Image Express, 820 Third Avenue), Jade Smith (b) and the other children were each given a Kodak Max one-time-use camera.4. Some kids are born stylists. Cooper Witte eyed the rack keenly, immediately chose the outfit she wanted (a), a CK Calvin Klein Jeans Kids top ($17 at Sears and Stern's) and Gap skirt ($48, at Gap stores nationwide), and never looked back. In fact, while the other girls were still pulling on pants, Cooper was the first to the accessories table, where she grabbed the crown jewel, the Judith Leiber of kids' purses (b): a Hello Kitty sequined change bag ($15 at Kobe Alley Corporation, 8 Elizabeth Street). Or check out the Web page, www.sanrio.com, for a store near you.5. It wouldn't be a fashion shoot if a model didn't cry. Spencer Clayton is smiling in this picture as he considers different hats, but his mood took a dive moments later when he tried on an H&M; T-shirt that resembled a sheriff's outfit. Although adults told him he looked handsome, Spencer didn't feel handsome. He stood in a corner, brooding. When he was asked if he was O.K., his eyes filled with tears. ''I don't want to wear this,'' he said, and was quickly reminded that he could wear anything he wanted. Seconds later, the shirt was off and Spencer, having replaced it with a Ralph Lauren jersey ($25, at Polo Ralph Lauren), was cool again.6. Finally, the girls love products. They all went crazy over a table filled with makeup. Big winners were (a) Sweet Georgia Brown's Rockin' Roll Body Glitter ($1.99 at Rite Aid), Z New York's Barely Blushing Gel ($13 at Zitomer, 969 Madison Avenue), Girl Eye Shadow and sparkle nail polish from Stuf by Lafco ($10 and $7 at Nordstrom) and Wet 'n' Wild Lipstick (99 cents at Rite Aid). While Yasmine Alfakey experimented with blue mascara on her eyebrows and cheeks, most girls, like Jade Smith (b), were pretty in pink. -- Text by Nell Scovell",2000-07-30T05:00:00+0000

You can't carry a black and silver purse with next season's brown tweeds. And that satin Gucci clutch with the gold chain strap certainly does not go with autumn's Manolo herringbone stilettos. To accommodate the overextended fashionista, the latest accessories innovation is handbags with detachable handles. Givenchy offers the Charade bag, far right, named after a style Audrey Hepburn had in the 1963 film of that name. The rectangular purse, available in black or polished calf for $760, has eight handles. Purchased separately, they include a pony skin strap with a graphic print, $180, and a Swarovski-crystal-encrusted one, $500. Searle offers a less pricey transformable pocketbook called Bag du Jour, left, in denim with python or ostrich trimmings, and in beachy canvas. The bag, with no handle, costs $48, or $68 for the tote size. Leather handles, $55 each, come in brown, green, red, lavender, blue and six other shades, and they clasp through holes in the top with a fishing-style hook. What's next? Shoes with removable heels?

While American women still torture themselves with eyelash curlers, the French subscribe to a more lasting approach to lash maintenance: eyelash perms. They have recently become available in New York at the Ella Bache Spa at 8 West 36th Street. ''Frenchwomen don't use eyelash curlers,'' said Anne-Cecile Curot, the manager. In an exacting process, Ms. Curot glues one of three sizes of miniature rollers to the client's lashes, then applies a perming gel, whose active ingredient, ammonia, is what gives hair salons their pungent smell. Asked about the solution's safety, Ms. Curot replied, ''It is formulated to be close to the composition of tears.'' The 40-minute procedure, which, unlike eyelash dyeing, is legal in New York, ends with a collagen-based neutralizing treatment. ''It's great in the summer, when many women don't like to wear mascara,'' Ms. Curot said. The perm lasts six to eight weeks and costs $50. DEBRA SCOTT",2000-07-30T05:00:00+0000

Survived by daughters Susan Bell of Manhattan Beach, CA, Nancy Ostlund of Tucson, Arizona and sister Rosalie Heyman of White Plains, NY. Born January 26, 1908 in Brooklyn, NY. Educated at City College of NY and Brooklyn Law School. Acted four years in NY theatre and movies. Wrote sketches for Broadway plays as well as gags for radio and comedians. His long career in advertising began as a copywriter with BBD&O. Fourteen years with The NY American and Herald Tribune Newspapers doing advertising and editorial work. His career for over 20 years with Schenley Distillers included serving as sales and marketing management, public relations, advertising director and vice president. Sander spent 26 productive retirement years serving as a consultant to Rhinebeck Savings Bank, as an advisor to the Astor Home, and as a devoted, motivated volunteer engaged in fundraising, advertising and marketing for Northern Dutchess Hospital. There his friends and colleagues established The Sander Heyman Fund in Support of Volunteerism so as to honor him for his years as a dedicated volunteer. He spent the last five years of his life in Tucson, Az in order to be close to his daughters, where he attended The Lions Club and edited his residential home newsletter. He continued to maintain his independence, quick wit, creativity and positive attitude to the end. Few men have given so generously of their time to their work, their family, their community and their friends as did Sander all his life. During his lifetime he helped many friends and colleagues with their problems, showing concern, encouragement and generosity. He was loved by all and will be greatly missed.",2000-07-30T05:00:00+0000

The image of the man who promised a future based on ''compassionate conservatism'' is murkier than it was a few weeks ago, as is the very meaning of his trademark term. The Philadelphia convention will be an exercise in political packaging whose decisive moments will be Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, the final drafting of the G.O.P. platform, and Richard Cheney's reintroduction to the national audience. All these, in turn, will determine whether Mr. Bush puts his stamp on the Republican Party or the party's right wing draws a hard-edged, highly ideological template for his candidacy.",2000-07-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Pains of Apostasy,"The Japanese novelist Shusaku Endo (1923-96) is best known in the West for ''Silence,'' his historical novel of Christian martyrs in 17th-century Japan. A Christian himself, Endo wrote from the straddled vantage of a Japanese man who embraced a Western philosophy; his fiction is at once the work of an insider and an alien. The stories collected in FIVE BY ENDO (New Directions, paper, $7) are among his best, and they are published here in a sleek, inexpensive volume. In ''Unzen,'' a middle-aged man with an unnamed guilt visits the sulfurous valley where Christians were tortured centuries before. Endo's prose is unadorned, yet in his hands sainthood becomes ambiguous: the martyr blazes with glory, but the cowardly apostate ''endures a pain none of you can comprehend.'' Sin, in Endo's view, is sometimes nothing more than the failure to acknowledge common humanity. ''Japanese in Warsaw'' follows a group of touring businessmen as they ''waddled in single file like ducks'' in search of souvenirs and cheap sex, unable to make any connection between the city's tragedies and themselves. Things, as much as people, can be storytellers: in ''The Box,'' old photos unlock the forgotten history of a half-Japanese Christian interrogated by the military police during World War II. Haunted by the relics the woman left, the narrator muses that ''trees and rocks and even postcards saturated with the thoughts of men must all speak to one another in hushed voices.'' In Endo's hands, the past is always vital in the present and how we judge history is in turn a judgment on ourselves. Janice P. Nimura",2000-07-30T05:00:00+0000
