us,Book Ends,"Trends. A lot of people are asking, What are the current trends in books? Herewith a quick rundown on the current hot subject matter, as gleaned from here and there. Our first trend comes to us courtesy of a friend whom, because he prefers anonymity, we'll dub Constant Reader. Constant Reader writes us in a state of alarm over. the newest wave of doomsday books that have been flooding the market for the past year or so. The primary disaster areas are (a.) what's going to kill us because we don't have enough of it and (b.) what's going to ruin us financially. He lists such titles as You Can Profit From Monetary Crisis, Soviet Conquest From Space, Are You Radioactive? Mortgage on America, The Ameiican Food Scandal, Meat Eaters Are Threatened, The Coming Credit Collapse, The Great Wall  Street Scandal, The Wall Street Gang, The Brain Changers, Facing Starvation, etc., etc. Even such big thinkers as Richard Goodwin (The Human Condition) and Robert Heilbroner (An Inquiry into the Human Prospect) are gloomy. With all that disaster about it's not surprising that another trend is death. It appears that we have, saturation of the market, though, so this trend is shall we say a dying one. Rape, self defense, consumer selfprotection are some more trends for your collection. And confessions of former con men and also cops (the two are not necessarily interchangeable). There is a certified trend in Sherlock Holmes books; also Patty Hearst books. Perhaps we can anticipate a book that has Holmes solving the Hearst case. Meanwhile, back at the political stock market, Watergatefigure books are holding, Presidential memoirs are quoted high and impeachment issues are being hastily retired. Disaster is also afflicting the novel, as it is the movies, with two books about fires in highrise office towers outthe two of them will be made into one movie, which is thrifty. Novels about killer bees, killer sharks, killer whatevers, as well as normal rabbits, are big. Selfhelp is always big, sometimes threatening to make the Best Seller List resemble a Reader's Digest table of contents. What's coming up in this category? We're going to sayjust two words: Stress and Depression (small wonder with all those disaster books). And don't forget prehistoric visitors from outer space the occult, old age. Espionage, suspense, intrigue, paranoia are all big in fiction. Women's books are outexcept those by Victoria Holt and Susan Howatch. There is a glut of paperback romances on the market so production controls are being instituted; also, one company has decided not to call gothics gothics any moresuspense is preferred. Gothics, however, are doing well in paper; also maleaction series and Look for Words puzzles. Oh yes, first novels are outthey don't sell; consequently all writers should begin their careers with third novels. All the above trends will now selfdestruct.",1974-09-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen:' Murdered House' Has Grisly Inhabitants"" The Cast","If you have a soft spot for ruined grandeur, for romantic decay, you'll be captivated by the opening shots of ""The Murdered House,"" a Brazilian movie that is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room. The picture focuses on an elegant family ravaged with debts; their mansion is falling to piecesand so (on a grand scale) are they.The movie, which is intensely operatic, begins well; two members of this oppressive tribe detest the entire clan and are eager to humiliate it. One is a defiant transvestite, who says that he's possessed by the soul of his dead aunt, and the other is the beautiful, restless wife of one of the glum sons. (Norma Bengellwho bears a stunning resemblance to Jeanne Moreau  brings strength and subtlety to a complex part.) Although the Brazilian director, Paulo Cesar Saraceni, has studied with Bernardo Bertolucci and Marco Bellochio; his extrav-vagent personas seems more akin to those of Federico Fellini.About halfway through the movieafter a botched suicide and a successful onethe narrative suddenly jumps 17 years and becomes thoroughly confusing. The characters haven't aged at all (although some of them have grown quite crazy). There's some incest afoot, butdue to the fact that a baby or two were born off camerait's terribly hard to tell which mother is making out with whose son, and who did or didn't sleep with the gardener.However, the most impassioned couple hits the sack in such a public spot that their relatives needn't miss a single motion. (Despite the lack of privacy, this scene is extraordinarily, erotic.) But much of the acting declines into gusts of bitter laughter and stagey declamations, as hatred becomes the motivation for almost everything. Two characters rend their clothes in rapid succession, acorpse gets its face slappedfinally, we're in a realm beyond tragedy or lunacy, and the emotions have become too exotic to follow.The photography is magnificent throughout: the browns, blacks, and whites of the landscape simmer in contrast to the lush green gardens, and there's a daring shot of a lifeless body that recalls Mantegna's foreshortned view of the dead Christ. Although the movie doesn't fulfill the promise of its first scenes, let's hope that more of Mr. Saraceni's films are shown in this country.",1974-09-06T05:00:00+0000

There have been a plethora of books the past few years written by prislners, notably Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice and George Jackson's Soledad Brother, but we can't recall any written by the men on the other side of the clanging doorthe guards. Now, suddenly, we have a brace of them, both first novels, The Rap, by Ernest Brawley, published in June by Atheneum, and Lethal Gas, by Ron Kurz, published in September by M. Evans. Mr. Brawley is a 37yearold Californian who grew up within the walls (his father was a guard) and worked as a guard himself for a year. The Rap, is in a realistic style and the publisher likened it to James Jones's work. Lethal Gas falls into the black humor category and is in the form of diary entries by a prisoner called The Creep, letters, internal memoranda, news clippings and excerpts from the warden's Daily Bulletin (Information and Guidance from the Office of the Warden)as well as standard novelistic scenes. Lethal Gas has evoked in one blurb writer the name of Nathanael West, while Herbert Katz, editorinchief at M. Evans, terms it a prison Up the Down Staircase. In publishing, people tend to think in soandso is another soandso terms. At any rate, Mr. Kurz, a 33yearold Baltimore native, did eight years as a guard, administrator and troubleshooter at four different Maryland correctional institutions, at a time of much turbulence, corruption and administrative shakeupsall reflected in his book. Permanently paroling himself from prison work, he, became the manager of two theaters in Baltimore and wrote much of Lethal Gas in his office. Mr. Brawley's hero is a prison guard, as is Mr. Kurz's. The former discovers that the villain of the story is a cousin of his (Mr. Brawley says that it is not uncommon for prison guards to have relatiVes in prison); Mr. Kurz's hero, an idealistic young man named C. C. Thomas is friendly with a black prisoner and ends up siding with the prisoners. Both books have been sold to the movies, and Ring Lardner Jr., who wrote the screenplay for M*A*S*H, will do the honors for Mr. Kurz's book.

Her personality is too forceful for ingenue roles: Her tastes and sympathies also impose boundaries upon her activities. The bel canto repertoire, for example, is beyond her comprehension. Most of the Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini operas strike her as stupid. She has sung Rossinis. Mose and admires it, yet she has little patience with the rest of his works. All they basically require, she remarks, is someone who can stand still and sing. She calls arias like Cam nome and numbers like the Sextet from Lucia inane. In such music she can find nothing to identity with, nothing that speaks to her of human concerns.

In many ways Querelle is the purest and the most austere enactment of those romantic situations that Genet's envy of handsome young men caused. him to return to again and again. The charming little queens who graced Our Lady of the Flowers have disappeared, but they have been replaced by the more complex Lieutenant Seblon, naval officer who maintains a severely masculine exterior in order to disguise the fits of ecstasy he rehearses in daydreams about his steward, Querelle. Whereas Querelle and all but one of the other adult men in the book are heterosexual and stupid, Lieutenant Seblon is clandestinely homosexual and as brilliant, devious and eloquent as Genet himself. We are treated to many excerpts from the Lieutenant's diary, and Genet mentions parenthetically: While the other characters are incapable of lyricism, which we are using in order to recreate them more vividly within you, Lieutenant Seblon himself is solely responsible for what flows from his pen. What flows are poetic effusions celebrating desire and masochismand Querelle.",1974-09-08T05:00:00+0000

Although Brussels was originally Flerirish, its 1.1million inhabitants are now mostly Frenchspeaking, and French can be used anywhere in the city. While the cultural FrancoFlemish mix survives, its charm has been diminished by Brussels drive to become the political and economic capital of Europe.

There is no reason, moreover, why major works of historical synthesis should not be directed toward a broad audience of nonspecialists, as the luminous example of Edmund Wilson's To the Finland Station suggests. Moreover, Revolution and Romanticism, conceived as the centerpiece of a trio of studies (the other two are O Strange New World: American CultureThe Formative Years, 1964, and The Age of Energy: Varieties of American Experience, 18651915, 1971) reflects a lifetime of scholarly work on the culturalhistorical relations between America.",1974-09-08T05:00:00+0000

My family of four ($30 for admission) left Stamford, Conn., at 9 A.M. At 11 A.M. we were at Exit 7A of the New Jersey Turnpike. Now the nightmare begins. Traffic moved at a crawl, and we did not arrive at the Great Adventure gates until 1 P.M. We paid our $30, and with great expectations entered Safari Forest. Once again unprecedented traffic halted us, and we did not reach the amusement area until 3 P.M. By this time my two children had been sitting in the car for six hours. Upon entering the amusement area, we found crowds of such magnitude and limes of such length that I must conclude that the enterprise was not planned with any regard to the poor working man. We not ony were ripped off for $30, but we had to stand in line to go to the restrooms, and to stand for 30 minutes to get a hot dog (no soda; they were all sold out by the time our turn came).

He didn't know that Alex Johnson, in his first game in a Yankee uniform, would hit a 12thinning home run Tuesday night for a 21 victory over the Boston Red Sox in the scramble for the American League East title.

us,Screen: 'Miller Odyssey':Documentary Focuses On Life of Writer,"Today, Henry Miller's name triggers a reflexyou can't disassociate it from the gleeful humiliation of the women in his books. But Robert Snyder's excellent 1969 documentary, ""The Henry Miller Odyssey,"" illustrates that Mr. Miller has far more to offer a contemporary audience than his sexual politics (which aren't reflected in this movie). The film is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room. Don't miss itif you care at all about writers or writing, it will ralse your morale.In many fascinating flashbacks, the movie details a writer's apprenticeship on the road from Brooklyn to Big Sur, while Mr. Miller narrates in his hoarse, nasal voice. In high school, he volunteered that his vocation might be clowningan impulse that's recalled when we see him (aged 78) laughing at his own long, rubbery face in a mirror. Early on, he worked in his father's tailor's shop, then became the employment manager of Western Union, and edited the catalogue of a mail-order house. Then he quit all jobs to write: ""I walked up Broadway feeling like the happiest man on earth""since he planned to be his own boss forever. ""Then began 10 years of misery""when he doubted his ability and couldn't sell his workfollowed by the exhilaration of Paris, ""where I found my voice,"" which surfaced in ""Tropic of Cancer.""Although Mr. Miller scorns all conventional work and celebrates play, a sense of his own enormous industry surges through the film. He also exults over the freedom that youthful poverty can give a writerwhile the camera ogles windows full of succulent French food that he couldn't afford in the thirties. It was invigorating to have ""no crutch of any kind,"" to learn to be ""a bird of prey, an animal."" Though he stresses his lifelong interest in the occult, his worship of the arts, and his studies of dreams, his romanticism is usually cut with comedyit's rather as though Huck Finn had been an urban esthete.The movie jumps most skillfully between past and present, between California and France. At one moment, the writer is treading water and talking about his mother, who consulted him (aged 4) about having a wart removed. She got blood poisoning and blamed him for itfor which he never forgave her. Soon, he's cheerfully discussing suicide with Lawrence Durrell. Both agree that it was much more tempting when they were young.There are fond visits with his old friends, including Anais Nin. He also reads a very moving passage about a favorite relative, an aunt who lost her mind. As an adolescent, he had to take her to the asylum; on that journey, she saw blue and green cows, whose names she knew. His rage at the society that insisted on confining her sounds like fuel for his future rebellions.In the last shot, Mr. Miller vanishes on a bicycle. All in all, he has some of the gaiety that Yeats attributed to sages, and it's a privilege to see it on the screen.",1974-09-13T05:00:00+0000

The three women had all been infertile due to diseased, blocked or missing Fallopian tubes, Dr. Bevis's press release reported. The researchers had surgically removed eggs from them, fertilized the eggs in test tubes with the sperm of their husbands and then reimplanted them in the women's wombs.

Within two months he and his partner, Bob Siegel, had redesigned that space into a fresh sculptural interiorall pristine white with hardly any furniture. The lowest level (below ground level on the entry side, but exposed at the back) became a bank of four bedrooms and tvc'o baths linked to a large, twostory high playroom.

us,Book Ends,"Future Ford. In an analogously enviable position to Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, who found themselves with a biography of Gerald Ford on their hands when Mr. Nixon resigned, is a small publisher called The Third Press. The company commissioned a biography of Vice President Ford (as he then was) around the first of this year, and the writer they chose to do it was the then Washington bureau chief of The Detroit News, Jerald F. terHorst. So Third Press now has on their hands the nearly completed MS. of Gerald Ford and the Future of the Presidency, which they will rush through for late October publication. Joseph Okpaku, the Nigerianborn president of The Third Press, explained his prescience matteroffactly. He was looking around for a political book related to the Watergate troubles (as who wasn't?) and after several possibilities fell through, decided to focus on the postWatergate situation. This led him to zero in on Mr. Ford as the future Mr. Republican; the remaining problem was to choose an author. Mr. terHorst had the obvious credentials of being from Mr. Ford's home state and a respected political journalist; he also fit Mr. Okpaku's criterion of avoiding an Eastern liberal writer. Events moved apace and as the deadline for an ad announcing the book drew near, the title was not set, though Gerald Ford: Past, Present and Future was a front runner. But as Mr. Nixon's departure became more urgently likely the present title was chosen, the day before the resignation. Mr. terHorst's appointment as press secretary did not alter the content of the book in any way, Mr, Okpaku said. The President merely told him to be objectivenobody's perfect. So the promise, at least, is of an open biography. The book ends with Mr. Ford's accession and Mr. terHorst's speculations on what stamp Mr. Ford will place on the office. The Third Press is sometimes vaguely thought of as a black publishing house, but actually Mr. Okpaku has always sought a general list. At any rate, he is anticipating the company's first best seller, plans a 50,000copy first printing and expects to double that. Incidentally, Mr. Okpaku does not always guess right politically. Before the French Presidential elections, he commissioned a book by Francois Mitterand, the Socialist candidate, who lost.",1974-09-15T05:00:00+0000

After months of preparation the house, naturally, was not ready: the stair carpet wasn't laid until the end of March, and on 1 April fenders and fireirons were still not complete.) All of which would mean, presumably, that Miss Drabble's study would be approximately as interesting as her subject's life, which does not inspire confidence, since Bennett, while colorful enough for a man of letters, was hugely prolific and therefore spent much of his time sitting at his desk and moving his hand across pieces of paper.",1974-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Antonia,' Film Portrait of a Conductor","The headlines refer to ""triumphs."" But the tone is patronizing: ""Yankee Girl Startles Berlin Critics"" (The New York Times, 1930.) Along with the acclaim for a deeply serious conductor, there's the lurch of astonishment at the mere fact of her sex. ""Antonia,"" a superb documentary about conductor Antonia Brico, details the achievements and the struggles that began for a child who was first taught piano because she bit her nailsand continue for the 73-year-old who now leads a community orchestra in Denver.The film, directed by Judy Collins, singer, and Jill God-milow, film maker, who was co-director of the documentary ""Tales,"" opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and will run through Oct. 1.When she was 28, critics called Dr. Brico a great conductor. After directing the Berlin Philharmonic, she twice conducted the Metropolitan Opera. 'Ovations ensued, but she was denied a third concert because John Charles Thomas, the baritone, wouldn't work with a woman. Between 1934 and 1937, she assembled and conducted a women's symphony, which thrived until she tried to convert it into an ensemble of both sexes""I want people to mix in symphonies as they do in life."" But the project was rejected by the board of directors at Carnegie Hall because the concept was undramatic. The press had eagerly quoted Dr. Brico when she said that ""Art is sexless,"" or when Jose Iturbi sneered at women musicians. But when she simply performed as an artist, she wasn't sizzling copy.In the film's most searing moment. Dr. Brico tells Judy Collins (who was her piano student) that she has only about 5 performances a year  when she has the energy for 4 or 5 a month. While a soloist can play a piece for herself, a conductor needs the whole ensemble, along with the audience. Dr. Brico says. ""I cannot play my instrument  which is the orchestra,"" adding that she rarely confides this ""perpetual heartbreak"" to anyone. Such a personal revelation is terribly rare on screen  clearly, it's due to Dr. Brico's friendship with Miss Collins. Also, the latter is a good listener  which is no surprise.Recently, we heard Henry Miller (in Robert Snyder's documentary) reminisce about his early frustrations as a writer. But he was able to look back on those youthful difficulties after years of recognition. Dr. Brico has known no such luxury. Told by many that it was ridiculous for a woman to think of conducting, she admits, ""I felt that I'd never forgive myself if I didn't try."" And the pain and deprivation which she has known all her life are over-shadowed in this film by her ebullient, forthright warmth.The narrative of her life alternates with glimpses of her at workrehearsing or teaching. She also reflects on the emotional experience of conducting (including the acute separation pangs that follow a concert, evaluates the work of other conductors, and. evokes the strong support that she had from Jean Sibelius, Sir Adrian Boult, and Albert Schweitzerwho telegraphed ""Courage Love Success"" before a major performance.""Antonia"" is biographical cinema at its best, and it will also encourage many women in fields other than music, thanks to Dr. Brico's determination, her refusal to be defeated. The film ends, as it should, with bravos and applause.Also on the program is Jordan Belson's ""Light""7 minutes of beautifully shifting images that change radically in intensity and color. At moments the elusive patterns suggest stars, sand, water, or the sun. The results make the concept of psychedelia seem old-fashionedeven though the film appears as a highly sophisticated descendant of that movement.",1974-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Minamata':The Program,"""Minamata,"" the Japanese-made documentary that opened the Film Forum's fall season last night, is persuasive and often shocking evidence of the present dangers of pollution. Although the feature occasionally might call for fuller explanations, the awesome, sometimes death-dealing blight that struck Minamata, the fishing and manufacturing town on the island of Kyushu, is a sobering, forceful case history that leaves little doubt as to the dire results of man's current approach to the disposal of modern-living wastes.For the record, Minamata can point to its simple fishermen who have worked its waters for centuries, a large, modern fertilizer factory and, for the last two decades or so, to the sad distinction of being the home of ""Minamata disease."" This is attributed to the mercury-poisoned effluvia from that factory that made the cycle from fish to humans whom it incapacitatedor killedin various ways.Noriaki Tsuchimoto, the director of ""Minamata,"" who is a stranger to this observer, and a fairly large complement of associates shot their black-and-white footage in Minamata, its environs and Osaka in 1971, largely in question-and-answer sessions with victims or their survivors.The results are either dolefully factual or pitiably tearful but nearly always painfully arresting Dedication and devotion are obvious in the help given by affected families, friends and hospital personnel to children and grown ups afflicted by cerebral palsy-like retardation, paralysis, blindness or deafness.If these touching scenes in a major portion of the film are subdued, ""Minamata,"" nevertheless, strongly implies and occasionally illustrates what appears to be big industry and governmental apathy before it builds to a literally riotous climax as the diseased and their sympathizers descend on a meeting in Osaka of the impassive president and board of directors of the Chisso company, operators of the plant, to demand reparations and justice.One would like to read more details in the literal English subtitles such as the specifics of the infection or the newspaper accounts of last July, which listed 428 victims, 69 of whom died. An epilogue points out that the Chisso company paid about l.5-million to 138 victims last year.On the basis of the bleak record poignantly and pointedly presented in ""Minamata,"" that statistic doesn't seem to be the answer to the terrible, perhaps portentous, problem of pollution.",1974-09-20T05:00:00+0000

There is a broad geographical range from Montreal to northcentral Florida, which is the scene of a memorable hurricane in Relief. In this story, the high wind blows away what amenities exist between neighbors, middleclass and migrant. The author admits to having attended 25 different schools before the ninth grade.

us,"Books . About handcrafts, building, gardening, antiques, architecture and interior design.","A backtonature movement has been welling up in American society and along with it a deep nostalgia for the arts and values of the colonial past. In the search for the indigenous arts and skills of an earlier America, a new respect for handcrafts and individuality has been developing as many of the books presented here bear witness. An exquisite panorama of the work of potters, weavers, glass blowers, jewelers and wood turners which demonstrates that centuriesold traditions can be preserved even as modern applications lend a new vitality to ancient forms, as demonstrated by sixthgeneration Irish chairs, Carob leaf hats from Colombia, blownglass teapots from the United States, appliqued ceremonial hangings from Dahomey. The 64 color plates and 190 blackandwhite illustrations are given additional meaning by the opening essay by Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet and philosopher, who sees the return of hand craftsmanship in the United States, and Western Europe as one of the symptoms of the great change that is taking place in our contemporary sensibility. This is a very special book. Beginning with an awareness of beauty in the commonplace and a respect for natural materials, one discovers that design is everywhere  and everyone is a designer. This relationship between man, society and nature in shaping our environment is explored by the author in this remarkably thorough study of design, its history, principles, process and application. Hundreds of excellent illustrations covering the fine arts as well as crafts and industrial design reinforce the eloquent text. The silversmith, the furniture maker, the jeweler, the costume and dress designer are examined. Helen Evans covers the general (architecture, landscape design, urban theory, experimental art forms) and the specific (Tiffany lamps, Barcelona chairs, Bojeson monkeys, San Blas Indian textiles, Japanese rice paper, plastic baby toilets, macrame dresses, glass coffee makers). Have I missed anything? The author certainly has not. Another celebration of doing one's own thing. There's a surprising number of wellbuilt little octagons popping up in the woods these days, writes Art Boericke. His text and the accompanying color photographs by Barry Shapiro will tempt even the most timid to collect a few posts and beams, some loved bits and pieces for building materials and take a deep walk into the woods in search of a building site. The handhewn shelters shown in the bookoften made and decorated with found objects, driftwood, stained glass, shells, stones, unconventionally shaped windows and doorsexhibit a spontaneity and richness of imagination rarely seen in our more disciplined contemporary structures. With barn siding, native stone, adobe brick, logs and salvaged lumber, the builderimprovisers whose work is shown have created homes that are their personal statements about a way of life, a way that may still be possible. Some of the houses seem almost medieval with a monkish austerity; others are decorated with the gingerbread of Grimm's fairy tales. Others reflect the most modern architectural techniques. For those who need a lot of help in building their own home, not only how, but how much will it cost and how long will it take, this is the book. It takes no architectural or building expertise to follow these precise directions, clarified still more with 400 illustrations, although the tiny handwritten text may present some difficulties to the bifocal set. (There is also an edition set in regular type.) There are separate sections on how to site and how to finance a homemade home. A helpful bibliography accompanies each chapter. The roof section is particularly appealing with its drawings of the French mansard, the pyramid, spire, dome, hip, gambrel, shed and valley gable. It is the gable roof that is recommended here, since the book concentrates on teaching the reader to build a traditional, early American, wood frame house. It is not necessary to build a house to profit from the book: the amateur fixitupper or repairman will find it useful. With enormous grace, the author details the latest trends as well as the basic techniques of these crafts. There are splendidly lucid drawings of stitchingwhether it be flat, seed, looped or knottedand color and black and white illustrations of wall hangings; hand woven, threedimensional sculptures; decorative pillows; puff patchwork. A good book for the beginner and experienced stitcher alike. A joyful book in which Sharon McKain reveals that she, in fact, is the Great Noank Quilt Factory and that is actually one living room equipped with one sewing machine. Her work, which ranges from back packs and tobacco pouches to the traditional, warm, comfy down quilts, is illustrated in color photographs and blackandwhite line drawings. Her designs are simple and contemporary yet hark back to early American geometrical forms. The Cathedral Window Quilt, the Windmill Quilt and the YoYo are particularly charming.",1974-09-29T05:00:00+0000

There is news also in the backgrounds for these more sophisticated prints: The trend is to dark shiny walls. Designer Kevin McNamara covered the walls of his living room with a glossy tortoise shell vinyl. The corner banquette is upholstered in a cotton fabric with a squiggly print. Pillows are covered in dotted white linen. Natural accentsthe sisal rug and bamboo blindsgive the room a summery look. Across from the fireplace, an antique Louis XVI desk (right) is placed in front of the windows. Twin Louis XV arm chairs are leather covered on the front and upholstered in a quiet plaid on the back. Rattan and wicker have moved indoors to give contemporary interiors a yearround feeling of summer. Designer Robert Perkins paired wicker piecesthe folding beach chair, round cocktail table and small chairside tableswith a sofa and slipper chair covered hi awningstriped upholstery in the studio apartment of Kecia Keeble. Floors are covered in natural sisal. Shiny satin pillows mixed with striped ones spill over the sofa. Junglesized plants add drama. The lacquered Chinese table and chest (in foreground) hold sang de boeuf vases of fresh greenery. Serene monochromatic schemes are replacing those hot, hardontheeyes primarycolor schemes. Designers Mica Ertegun and Chessy Rayner of Mac II painted the walls of this Fifth Avenue apartment in a highshine charcoal brown. Everything else in the roomthe lowpile velvet rug, the three large sofas and the occasional chair, and the draperiesis a crisp white. The side tables. English antiques, blend with the twin modern Parsons tables covered in tortoise shell and the lacquered Chineseinspired coffee tables. The two English Chippendale arm chairs have subtle brownandwhite polka dot print seats. There's a fresh interest in trompe l'oeil floors now that sturdy clear polyurethane coatings protect painted floors and make them easy to keep up. The new painted floors have nothing of the peasant about them, but are another facet of the new subtlety. Designer Richard Neas painted the floor of his apartment with large squares that simulate the striation of cut agate. Another trompe l'oeil effect is the ceiling cove painted in a crisscross treillage. Twin armoires for clothes and books flank the daybed that sits in a mirrored alcove. The color schemepearl gray walls and offwhite upholstery mingled with beige and chamois accents in pillows and upholsteryreflects the trend to quiet, often monochromatic interiors.

The peasants are championed by a cowboy figure; the landlord, by a pack of hired, motorcycle-riding soldier-gunmen. Drawn to the peasants' champion and the leader of the gunmen, and torn between the two, is a peasant woman.Upon this basic structure have been piled the Scarecrow, part Christ figure, part minstrel; a bosomy dragon representing evil; the landowner's bourgeois retinue  given to clown make-up or satanic garb, whichever best serves the demands of the moment's symbolism; a mad holy man; a peasant chorus, and a set of insect-wing motorcycles and cycling costumes that appear to have come out of ""The Wild One"" by way of Attila the Hun and Tinker Bell.However many its faults, ""Night of the Scarecrow"" is too busy a film to be accused of dullness. At its best, this revolutionary pop opera is full of color and movement; and some of its musicpulsing with rhythm or wailing with despairis captivating, although the lyrics, at least in their English translation, seem less accomplished.Set beside the exceptionally good ""Os Fuzis"" (""The Guns""), a Brazilian film by Ruy Guerra, shown last June at the First Avenue Screening Room, that deals with essentially the same subject matter in the same locale from the same viewpoint, ""The Night of the Scarecrow"" comes off as a case of egregious bloat.",1974-09-30T05:00:00+0000

This strategy, however, caused problems both for countries that were not included in the bill last year and for American agencies with commitments for steppedup programs in the new bill.The continuing resolution, passed by Congress last June, runs out tomorrow.A Blow to EgyptiansHerman F. Eilts, the United States Ambassador in Cairo, cabled Mr. Kissinger last week that the new strategy was a blow between the eyes for the Egyptians and that it would leave President Anwar elSadat in a highly embarrassing and conceivably dangerous position.The Administration had requested as part of the new aid bill $250million in assistance for Egypt for clearing the Suez Canal, restoring cities along the canal and helping Egyptian trade. Egypt would not qualify for that aid under last year's bill.The Agency for International Development has also expressed unhappiness about the new strategy, since it would mean about $200million less in programs to help nations increase food production.The Administration had asked for about $255million in additional aid for food and nutrition in the new bill, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved $200million.",1974-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"Ophuls's 'Liebelei' Is Romantic, but Not Sentimental","The conviction that the past can be canceled out, that it ""doesn't count"" any more, is one of the illusions that feed romantic tragedy. That notion is beautifully illustrated in Max Ophuls's adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ""Liebelei,"" which was shown at the 12th New York Film Festival last Friday. As elsewhere, Schnitzler also stressed the importance of living in the present, of savoring what may be suddenly snuffed out.The movie, made in 1932 and set in Vienna, 1910, focuses on a touching love affair between a shy singer (Magda Schneider) and a vulnerable young officer (Wolfgang Liebeneiner) whose feelings surface most sensitively, despite all his strict military training. Before they met, he was involved with a married baroness. He breaks with his mistressbut although the liaison is over, her husband kills him in a duel. Evidently, being punished for the wrong thingor paying for a chapter of life that's pastwere recurrent themes of Schnitzler's. And meeting the right person after you've spent too long with the wrong one was the kind of irony that the playwright was fond of exploring.""Liebelei"" embodies what Edmund Wilson defined as Schnitzler's gift for ""lightly handled tragedy,"" and Ophuls's own lightness of style is as beguiling here as it later was in Schnitzler's ""La Ronde."" Amid the waltzes, the cafes, the elaborate staircases and winding back streets, the moments of emotional consequence are marvelously detailed. When the Baron (Gustaf Gruendgens) learns of his wife's adultery, he runs through his own palatial home and glares at the rooms where the couple met in a manner that's truly frightening; later, when he discovers that one of her keys fits her lover's door, he grinds it to and fro in the lock with outraged bitterness.Ophuls was at his best when he caused climates of feeling to build or change. As the singer and the officer begin to fall in love, their mutual absorption is subtly conveyed as they dance very slowly to rapid, noisy musicthey don't know that they're not with the rhythm. This scene is cleverly contrasted by the next one, in which the officer dances correctly but unenthusiastically with the woman whom he no longer wants. When the herocelebrating his freedom from the Baronessromps and fools about with his friends before a party, he and they seem particularly childlike and innocent; hence they (and we) are utterly unprepared for the Baron's sudden, threatening entrance.The movie makes the code of ""honor"" appear very stupid  and when another youthful officer protests that any shot that isn't fired in self-defense is ""criminal,"" his rebellion against the military is a denunciation of all senseless duels. All in all, it's a privilege to see a movie that is romantic without being sentimental. Since that distinction is rarely respected now, it's exhilarating to learn what Ophuls achieved more than 40 years ago.",1974-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film Festival: 'Stavisky,' Moody Rogue of the 30's:Belmondo at His Best in Resnais Creation He Charms, He Broods and Topples Regime","The difficulty of knowing what is true, of discovering what really happened, ripples throughout Alain Resnais's ""Stavisky""  a spell-casting mood piece that is also factually frustrating. Ideally, it should be possible to relish this fascinating movie on its own. But, since so little French history of the nineteen-thirties is provided, it's likely to send you flying to the library. (""Stavisky"" isn't perplexing just to Americans; a colleague reports that a Parisian audience was also bewildered.) The movie opened last night at the New York Film Festival and will be repeated tonight. It doesn't yet have a commercial releasebut it will be startling if it's denied one.Briefly the real Stavisky was an entrepreneur, an impresario and an accomplished swindler who bribed politicians, the police, the courts and the press; he also squandered all of his own wealth. When he flooded France with fake vouchers in 1932, the banks were closed. As a result, there were violent street riots early in 1933, in which a number of persons were shot by the police. The Government could no longer rely on the loyalty of the army or the police, and Premier Edouard Daladier was forced to resign. (Stavisky himself appears to have been an apolitical adventurer, although he had a megalomaniacal belief that he could solve the economic problems of Europeand also end unemployment. Apparently, the press dwelled on the fact that he was a Russian Jew, and the fascist agents in France exploited the anti-Semitic issue by insisting that foreign crooks were out to ruin the nation.The movie mutes the last point, but the characterization of Stavisky seems very faithful to the accounts of the period. He appears as a dual personality: a graceful bon vivant who luxuriates in every conceivable pleasure and an acute melancholic. There's a charming moment when he explains the difference between happiness and pleasure: he says that happiness can occur in a single moment, but that pleasure requires a huge investment of time  and that it's available only to the rich. He's also obsessed by suicides and by mysterious deaths. He was once a scruffy hood, but his friends remark that his present self despises his past one.As Stavisky, whom a journalist of the thirties called ""a gentleman among gangsters and a gangster among gentlemen,"" Jean-Paul Belmondo is at his best. Despite the tycoon's grandeur, he still breaks into a mobster's strut: arms swinging, wearing his shoulders high, he lunges forward with his torso aslant, while his respectable companions walk erect. Mr. Belmondo has all the authority and the gaiety of the man who refused to believe that he could make a mistake. But although others later call him crazy, we don't really see that aspect of his nature  perhaps because of the stubborn sanity that Mr. Belmondo brings to even his loopier roles.Charles Boyer is effortlessly elegant and supple as a baron who enjoyed Stavisky's company. The eyebrows rise delicately above those knowing eyes, and it's a treat to watch him playing with Mr. Belmondo: They seem to greet each other across the span of movie history. Anny Duperey at first appears as a brittle, expensive moll; she then emerges as a sympathetic person. The teasing, troubling musical score by Stephen Sondheim and the stunning art deco interiors suit the subject to perfection. There is also an engaging use of the theater: A reading from Jean Giradoux's ""Intermezzo"" and a performance of ""Coriolanus"" gently distill the themes of disorder and death.As usual, Mr. Resnais flirts with time: Here, there are many flash-forwardsmainly to a parliamentary committee, where witnesses testify about the Stavisky case. Most of these leaps into the future work very well, although there are a few too many of them. Less successful is the insertion of Leon Trotsky. Both he and Stavisky were exiles, but since their lives never touched, the revolutionary's appearance in the movie is unsettling. (Also, one wishes that the riots had been filmed  but perhaps they were omitted due to expense.) Meanwhile, despite its mystifications, ""Stavisky"" is one of the most rewarding films I've seen this yearand also one of the most intelligent.",1974-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Harper has had to grapple with a rising caseload of complaints, a staff that is extremely thin and Investiga. tory delays that sometimes spin out a lot longer than he would like.Apart from the standard remedies of bigger budgets and more personnel, Mr. Harper thinks solve of his agency's problems could be solved by establishing more county and municipal consumeraffairs offices with a grant of broad lawenforcement powers.Only a few of the 100 or so municipalities in the state that have opened consumer affairs offices have seen fit to equip them with subpoena powers or the right to prosecute civil violations.The same limitations apply to the six of the state's 21 counties that have so far opened consumer affairs agencies. Their function is largely one of mediation between businessmen and consumers. When that breaks down, their only recourse is to pass major violations on to Mr. Harper and his colleagues at the state level.The consumer would be better off, said Mr. Harper, if there was no need for referral on cases that could he handled on the local level. The response would be much quicker.There seemed to he no legal reasons, according to Mr. Harper, why municipalities cannot give their consumer agents enforcement powers. The counties, however, appear to be a somewhat different cup of tea. They have no legislative powers, and hence appear to have no right to give their consumer affairs officials the kind of teeth needed to deal with violations where arbitration is no help.",1974-09-30T05:00:00+0000
