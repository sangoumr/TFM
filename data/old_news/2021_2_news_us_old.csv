I tried to resist scratching, but the itch was relentless, spreading across the surface of my skin like a thousand invisible mosquito bites. Without realizing what I was doing, my hand began meandering down my legs, my nails raking my jeans in search of relief, before burrowing under the hem to sink directly into flesh. I itched during my part-time job at the campus film lab. I itched under the big wooden desk of my library carrel. I itched while dancing with friends on the beer-slicked floors of basement taprooms. I itched while I slept. A scree of oozing nicks, thick scabs, and fresh scars soon marred my legs as if they had been beaten with rose thistles.

From there, assorted selections of onigiri are being sold from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., daily through March 7. Previously, the window sold bento boxes, but the management decided to switch to onigiri. One reason was to offer freshly milled rice from the 2020 harvest in Niigata Prefecture, north of Tokyo. Its being processed at the Rice Factory in Scarsdale, N.Y. The quality of the rice is as essential for onigiri as it is for sushi, but onigiri is more snack than art. Usually offered in tidy nori wraps for easy transport, the fillings are humbler than the masterfully sliced fish of sushi, and include canned tuna with mayonnaise, fried chicken and breaded pork tonkatsu, $3.75 to $5 each. There are also assortments, with side dishes like miso soup and potato croquettes, that can be delivered for an extra fee. Get a couple of these sets and some sake or beer, and you have an izakaya at home. The onigiri come packaged in special paper used for wrapping food for 1,500 years.

us,The Biden Team Wants to Transform the Economy. Really.,"Anyone searching for an economic road map to the Biden presidency might find hints of one in a 40-page research paper written, appropriately enough, by the United Automobile Workers union. The document, originally published in 2018 and titled Taking the High Road: Strategies for a Fair E.V. Future, argued that even in the face of foreign competition, the American automobile industry could continue to provide well-paying manufacturing jobs  but only if the government invested huge sums in electric vehicles. The technology highlighted in the report, like prismatic cells for storing electrical charges, was cutting-edge, but the economic thinking behind it was decidedly old-school. Some passages, in their America First-ness, read as if they could have appeared in a Ross Perot ad from 1992  or, for that matter, a Trump ad from 2016. The U.A.W.s researchers insisted, for example, that critical parts like batteries must be produced at home, not by rival industrial powers. The economic potential of E.V.s will be lost if their components are imported, they wrote. Advanced vehicle technology should be treated as a strategic sector to be protected and built in the U.S.",2021-02-11T10:00:20+0000

Penfolds has been interested in California since the 1980s, and after considerable experimentation, it is now releasing four wines made mainly from grapes grown there, some from Australian cuttings it planted, blended with Penfolds fruit from Australia. The California varietals dominate. The powerful and complex top-of-the-line, Quantum Bin 98 cabernet sauvignon ($700 a bottle), which deserves cellaring, and the somewhat earthier and fruitier Bin 149 cabernet sauvignon ($149), both blends that include Australian wine, are labeled Wines of the World. There is also Bin 704 Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, which is all California ($70) absent sweetness or oaky swagger, but with a whiff of Napa Valley-style eucalyptus as it opens up. Bin 600 California cabernet-shiraz ($50) is the lightest, yet forceful and ready to drink. These wines, all 2018, all have a consistent bold, muscular character, with well-knit fruit, structure and acidity, described as the house style by Peter Gago, the winemaker.

Wollstonecraft was that rare thing in 18th-century England: a female public intellectual, one who argued passionately for womens place in society. More than two centuries later, men and women jostle in all matters of public life, and yet their likenesses in the public space do not. In the United Kingdom, by one estimate, only some 3 percent of public statues are of nonroyal women. The number is thought to be about 7 percent in the United States, but in New York City, up until last summer, there were famously only five statues of historic women: the Catholic saint Joan of Arc, the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, the Modernist writer Gertrude Stein, the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the abolitionist Harriet Tubman.

She was in her early 40s. Fifteen years earlier, OGrady had worked as an intelligence analyst for the federal government. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, she was tasked with reading around 10 international newspapers a day and, as she likes to say, at a certain point, words just became gelatinous. But from that experience OGrady was able to extract new meaning out of language. I did a poem a week, and when I got to the four-month mark, they started taking off, and I could tell something was happening, she says, though the knowledge that her own ideas could carry her from one place or plane to the next must have already been familiar. In addition to her time in Washington D. C., her pre-artist life included stints as a translator, a teacher, a student of fiction at the Iowa Writers Workshop and, as if she werent already intimidating enough, a rock critic.

Synchronized protests were taking place all across Europe, and for a brief moment it seemed possible to believe that they would actually make a difference.
