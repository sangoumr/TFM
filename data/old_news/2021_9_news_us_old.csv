His first film, 1996s Basquiat, is about his former contemporary Jean-Michel Basquiat, and is part biopic (the title character is played by the great Jeffrey Wright), part artistic treatise and almost as much about Schnabel, who actually painted the imitations of Basquiat works that appear in the film himself (he refers to them now as props) and shot various scenes inside his own New York City home.

In 1996, when Oprah announced the choice on her talk show, she said: I want to get the whole country reading again. Those of you who havent been reading, I think books are important! She explained how the club would work: Readers who wanted to have dinner with Mitchard could send a letter to a Chicago P.O. box or write us at America Online, those of us who know how to do that.

Its a conviction that allows us to ennoble ourselves with pathos, with rueful maturity, with wisdom won too late. To be certain that were at the beginning of something can mean feeling optimistic and openhearted about the future in a way that, especially these days, risks courting contempt. And to know that were in the middle of an era is  well, its not even a phrase, is it? Its nothing much at all, simply a kind of semipermanent Wednesday of the soul, a spirit-flattening acceptance of stasis and complacency. But nearing the end? In that, you have a lifetimes worth of wistfulness, and perhaps some bitterness and grief, not to mention prescience about what might come next. In short, life at the end of an era is  to use a term that might be coming to the end of its own era  lit. And it almost doesnt matter if the lighting is seductive and flattering or as harsh and glaring as if the music has just been turned off and the club is about to close.

us,The Ethereal Taste of Flowers,"IN 1845, NEARLY a year into a punishing 3,000-mile trek through the Australian interior (then still terra incognita to outsiders), the Prussian naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt attempted to eat the fruit of Pandanus spiralis, a tree that huddled at the edges of watering holes. Pandanus is a genus of tropical evergreens that grow in Southeast and South Asia, Oceania and Africa, with leaves that tend to rise and arch in a whorl around the stem and bulbous fruit, whose polyp-like knobs evoke a pineapples armor  hence the English name, screw pine. For Leichhardt, initial results were poor: the rich, mellow pear-like flesh of the fruit, he wrote, proved to be hot, and made our lips and tongues very sore. (Stomach trouble ensued.) Snooping around the remains of campfires abandoned by locals, he deduced that the fruit had to be buried in hot ash, then soaked and roasted before it could be considered edible.",2021-09-06T11:00:12+0000

But in the years between the world wars, as automobile and commercial air travel proliferated, life on the road became easier and more streamlined, as did the luggage the house produced.

If you take in more calories, or energy, than you use, you gain weight; if the output is greater than the input, you lose it. But while were often conscious of burning calories when were working out, 55 to 70 percent of what we eat and drink actually goes toward fueling all the invisible chemical reactions that take place in our body to keep us alive. We think about metabolism as just being about exercise, but its so much more than that, says Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. Its literally the running total of how busy your cells are throughout the day. Figuring out your total energy expenditure tells you how many calories you need to stay alive. But it also tells you how the body is functioning, Pontzer says. There is no more direct measure of that than energy expenditure.",2021-09-14T09:00:11+0000

The blond, pixieish Miss Mills gives a restrained, natural and gratifyingly mature performance. She is a likable youngster whose mannerisms and speech are unaffected and convincing.

Watkins, author of several books of his own, including We Speak for Ourselves: How Woke Culture Prohibits Progress, the account is dedicated to every child who knows there is more to this life than people tell them is possible. It begins in Brooklyn, where Anthony was born, with the view from his familys apartment: After pushing our old speaker against the wall and climbing my small body on top of it, I could peer through the black iron bars. Anthony describes hoopers, dreamers, rappers, older kids trading dope for cash, girls playing jacks and his sister, Michelle, doing double Dutch with ballerina footwork. As his view widens, readers get to see the rest of his family, their move to Baltimore, their losses and challenges and Anthonys road to the N.B.A. Fun fact: Anthony isnt the only best-selling Laker right now.

Unlike a necklace or bracelet, which can be little more than a simple rope or chain offhandedly draped around the neck or wrist, diadems are, by definition, grand. The early Greeks replaced laurel and olive wreaths with gold versions in increasingly complex styles. During the 18th century, gemstones became the focus and the tiara morphed from a unisex accouterment into a female-identified one. Napoleon, a die-hard neo-classicist, was a particular champion  he lavished tiaras on both wives  as was Queen Victoria, whose example was followed by the ladies of her court. This design, by Cartier, the Paris-based house that has been crafting tiaras since the turn of the 20th century  including the 1936 Halo commissioned by King George VI for his wife, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and later worn by Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, at her wedding in 2011  continues that tradition. Made of 18-karat white-gold arabesques and adorned with diamonds in cushion, square and brilliant cuts, it brings fantasy, and historys most regal moments, vividly alive.

He followed with a somewhat meandering, brilliant guide on how to think not just about Gandhi but about all people who have been practically beatified for their work on Earth. As with all of Orwells nonfiction work, Reflections bristles with a restless, contrarian energy that refuses to accept any party line about its subject and tries  desperately, at times  to place Gandhi within a capacious yet still critical context. How do you offer him credit for his bravery and the righteousness of his cause while still offering him the respect to wrestle with his ideas? One may feel, as I do, a sort of aesthetic distaste for Gandhi, Orwell concluded. One may reject the claims of sainthood made on his behalf (he never made any such claim himself, by the way), one may also reject sainthood as an ideal and therefore feel that Gandhis basic aims were anti-human and reactionary, but regarded simply as a politician, and compared with the other leading political figures of our time, how clean a smell he has managed to leave behind!",2021-09-27T19:12:51+0000

The Mangans have brought in a matcha grinder from Japan; Mr. Mangan also does some of his own roasting. And at this location theyve added a menu of tea-driven sweets, including a chestnut Mont Blanc cake with matcha, delicate mousses, a baroque layered parfait, and excellent matcha chocolate chip cookies that play up the chocolaty taste of the tea.

The collaboration between Jake Dell, the owner of Katzs, and Lesley Gracie, the master distiller at Hendricks, came about as an April Fools gag. This year, Hendricks posted a recipe for gin-infused pickles on Instagram without any intention of selling them. But the response was such that they ended up working with Katzs. The pickles are in the half-sour category, barely; they still have the fresh green crunch of a new pickle. The brine conveys enough juniper so a splash of it along with a few slices of the pickle will enhance that martini.",2021-09-27T20:48:17+0000

The secondhand vats, which can handle 3,000 liters (3,170 quarts) of milk, replace Mr. Kehlers smaller vessels. Most importantly they are engineered so the curds are transferred to a vacuum system by gravity to the lower level of the creamery where they are pressed and formed, and no longer require the hands-on chore of moving the curds manually. Its automated, easier to clean, theres no waste, we can make more cheese and they will be more consistent, he said.
