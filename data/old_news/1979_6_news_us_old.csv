It's thoroughly silly and endearing.""Phantasm,"" which opens today at Loew's State 2 and other theaters, is about two orphaned brothers, Hardy Boys types though they do curse freely. Mike (Michael Baldwin), who is in his early teens, and Jody (Bill Thornbury), in his early 20's, live near Morningside Mortuary and Cemetery, a spooky establishment run by a tall, ashen-faced fellow who doesn't like people until they are dead. You might call him the mortician's mortician. He not only will embalm your nearest and dearest, he'll kill him first.When Mike and Jody investigate the Morningside premises, at first separately, then together, they are attacked by all sorts of unlikely creatures and objects, including something that looks like an aluminum baseball that flies on its own through the air and attacks the foreheads or victims with what seems to be a corkscrew.""I do know one thing,"" Jody says after one narrow escape, ""something weird is going on up there.""""Phantasm"" is the sort of breathless tale whose chapters are bridged with the movie equivalent to the ""and then. . . ."" of prose fiction. What happens next is never more logical than what happened before, but at least something is happening, which often necessitates that characters and facts be suddenly introduced (or dropped) with the kind of heedless enthusiasm that only 8-year-old raconteurs can muster.I've no idea how old Mr. Coscarelli is, but he is apparently very young and energetic. He wrote and directed ""Phantasm,"" in addition to being its director of photography and its editor. There's nothing great about the performances but they are adequate and the movie looks pretty good. The house that stands in for the spooky mortuary is the same Victorian pile that was used in ""Burnt Offerings."" Being old and picturesque, it could become to horror movie sets what Vincent Price is to horror movies.",1979-06-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Olmi's 'The Tree of Wooden Clogs' Opens:Peasants of 1900,"THE awkwardly titled ""The Tree of Wooden Clogs,"" Ermanno Olmi's fine Italian film (and winner of the top Cannes festival prize last year), has almost nothing going for it except that it may well be a masterpiece.If the title doesn't put you off in the way it suggests tulip-time in Holland, Mich., then the subject will. Here is a leisurely paced, appreciative, somberly beautiful movie, acted by non-professionals, about peasant life in northern Italy at the turn of the century. It's a movie in which no one dies and no one can see into the future, a movie with no particular narrative line and whose politics are never made explicit. Yet there's more political content in almost any one sequence of ""The Tree of Wooden Clogs"" than there is in all of Bernardo Bertolucci's grandiose ""1900.""Perhaps the worst handicap carried by the film is that it will be impossible to talk about in trend-conscious New York without sounding as if one had just discovered the joys of Rosa Bonheur. Someone is bound to say, ""You can't be serious.""Like Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven,"" Mr. Olmi's film is almost too beautiful for its own good. In lesser films  and I'll probably be castigated for including some of Flaherty's work in this category  such density and clarity of image have a way of obscuring harsh subject matter or rendering it sentimental. Beauty is full of peril for the film maker. It can make reality seem exotic by putting it at a distance.However, Mr. Olmi (""The Sound of Trumpets,"" ""The Fiancs,"" etc.) is a rigorous director. He photographs his films straight-on, at eye-level. He admires these peasants without patronizing them or inflating the scope of their lives. Further, just as he chooses not to impose unlikely political consciousnesses on his characters, he refuses to use the tricks of melodrama to hold our attention. Instead, he has made a film that follows the lives of the farmers much as they follow the course of the seasons.The film covers approximately a year and focuses on the members of three peasant families who live a communal existence on a large estate owned by a landlord who, though a resident, could not seem more absentee if he lived in Southern California. As they are faceless functions in the landlord's life, so is he the still unquestioned authority in theirs.Mr. Olmi, who is his own cameraman as well as writer, director and editor, moves through these lives in the manner of someone remembering a long-gone past, though Mr. Olmi, who was born in 1931, could only be remembering the memories of others. Instead of shaping this material with hindsight, he allows us in the audience to interpret it ourselves. The movie thus involves us in ways far more moving than do those films that insist on telling us everything we are supposed to feel (and probably don't).Though Mr. Olmi shoots his films at eye-level and always sticks closely to the details of specific events, the effect of the film is of knowledge gained obliquely. The movie, which runs slightly more than three hours, is an accumulation of dozens of experiences of children, adults, old people, village idiots, of harvest times and plantings, of moments of boredom and jealousy, celebrations, fatigue, brief pleasures and mysterious ones. It moves so effortlessly, often with great humor and always with compassion, that it seems much shorter than most 90-minute films.The quality of the performances of the huge cast is staggeringly good. The faces are beautiful without being pretty. You may be particularly taken by some of the children, all of whom look a bit underfed and undersized, and by the relationship of an especially tiny little girl and her ancient grandfather who grows tomatoes by his own secret formula. Near the end there's a sequence that more or less exemplifies Mr. Olmi's method. It's a day-long trip by river boat to Milan where a young farm couple, on their honeymoon, witness a series of violent street demonstrations and never once question the reasons for the unrest. Politics are beyond them, though not Mr. Olmi.""The Tree of Wooden Clogs,"" which opens today at Cinema Studio I, is a profoundly serious film that stands outside time and fashion.",1979-06-01T05:00:00+0000

He may also have some portion of the family acting talent, but a movie like ""Sunnyside""  designed almost entirely to capitalize on Mr. Travolta's resemblance to his brother  makes it hard to hazard a guess. He's a lot more appealing than his surroundings. But these are so dismal that almost anything would look bright by comparison.Mr. Travolta plays the paradoxical role of a saintly gang leader, a baaaad Boy Scout. He lives in a tough neighborhood, wants to move away with his nice girlfriend, and meanwhile spends a lot of time either squabbling with his family at the dinner table (remember ""Saturday Night Fever""?) or strutting down the street (see note above). He handles the role's minimal and predictable demands well, though, especially in view of the camera's determination to shoot him only in long shot or in profile. These angles aren't designed to make the most of his performance; they mean to camouflage the fact that in full-face he doesn't look quite as much like John.Another promising actor lost in ""Sunnyside"" is Andrew Rubin, who makes a character named Reaper appropriately oily. A third player, who is crucified in one of the film's most graphically ugly moments, does a fine job up until then.I couldn't catch his character's name because, at yesterday's first show at the Embassy II theater, the house had been taken over by a gang of kids who consumed a fifth of something-or-other, slammed seats around, made a wide range of grunting noises and screamed catcalls at the movie. Sex scenes made them particularly noisy; scenes in which gangs drew up war plans, on the other hand, held their rapt attention.

As a class, those who were young and literate in the Eisenhower and Kennedy years can be said to have received such pictures with utter credulity and in a state of mind resembling awe.

In the western world, however, where it came to prominence as a practice of papal authority commencing with Pope Adrian I in the eighth century and reached its zenith during the Renaissance, it was repeatedly condemned (e.g. Dante, Inferno, 19.31, 19.5281, 27.85.129; Petrarch, Epistulae sine nomine 11, ed.

I.116 (1670)  Ministers that buy the favour of the Nepotisme, do revive..a new Neronisme of Tyranny.) The Church itself ultimately took steps to impede it through papal bull (Pope Pius V, Admonet nos [1567]) and constitution (Roman= decet pontificem [1692]).

us,"Screen: Mae West, 87, Does an Encore:Trying for 6th Marriage","""SEXTETTE"" is a disorienting freak show in which Mae West, now 87 years old, does a frail imitation of the personality that wasn't all that interesting 45 years ago. The movie, which opens today at the Victoria and other theaters, is a poetic, terrifying reminder of how a virtually disembodied ego can survive total physical decay and loss of common sense.The character we see in this peculiar film looks less like the Mae West one remembers from even ""Myra Breckinridge"" than like a plump sheep that's been stood on its hind legs, dressed in a drag-queen's idea of chic, bewigged and then smeared with pink plaster. The creature inside this getup seems game but arthritic and perplexed. She walks with apparent difficulty. One eye sometimes sags and the voice, despite Hollywood's electronic skills, cracks like the voice of the old lady she really is. Under these circumstances, the sexual innuendos are embarrassing. Granny should have her mouth washed out with soap, along with her teeth.The story, based on a play written some years ago by Miss West, is about a world-famous movie star and her attempts to consummate her sixth marriage to Sir Michael Barrington (Timothy Dalton) despite repeated interruptions by former husbands, lovers, dress designers, secret agents, publicity people and delegates attending an international peace conference just upstairs. It's a plot that Miss West has often favored, and it freely reprises a lot of lines from earlier pictures.The movie was directed by Ken Hughes (""The Small World of Sammy Lee,"" ""Cromwell"" and so on), a fellow you might think had better things to do than to prop up the Tower of Pisa. In addition to Mr. Dalton, ""Sextette"" features a number of other people who, in happier circumstances, are decent actors. These include Tony Curtis, George Hamilton, Ringo Starr and the incomparable Dom DeLuise. There are some original songs and some old ones, a couple of which sound as if they'd been lip-synched by Miss West to old recordings.The real problem with ""Sextette"" is neither the passage of time nor the erosion of talent. There was never a great deal of talent there to begin with. Miss West's function in the early 30's was to send up and get around the hypocritical moral prohibitions of the day. It made her famous but then the times passed her by. ""My Little Chickadee"" is the only film she ever made that's still worth seeing today, but its star is W.C. Fields, not Miss West who, in the presense of a comedian of Fields's great character, comes across as monotonous and mean-spirited, even less sexy than the goat that, at one point, Fields cuddles under the deliriously mistaken notion that he has finally bedded Mae.""Sextette,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a lot of crudely suggestive dialogue.",1979-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Down and Dirty' Evokes Roman Squalor:On the Bottom,"AN extended family of about 28 live in a one-room shanty beside a highway in Rome, and their plight is made to seem both revolting and peculiarly romantic in Ettore Scola's ""Down and Dirty."" On the one hand, these characters perform most of their bodily functions in public and look upon rats virtually as household pets; Mr. Scola's emphasis is upon earthiness in the extreme. On the other hand, they seem to have no trouble eating or staying healthy in their tiny, insular world, which for all its squalor looks perpetually sunny and warm. Mr. Scola has described the film as ""a satirical tragedy,"" but the principal mood it strikes is one of deep confusion.The production notes for the film include a statement by Mr. Scola and his screenwriter, Ruggero Maccari, in which they deplore the isolation of the poor from the rest of society. Mr. Scola, in a separate interview, has explained that his film is about subproletarians, who, he says, differ from proletarians in that they have absolutely no class consciousness. However compassionate and understanding they may be, though, Mr. Scola and Mr. Maccari also state that ""the poor are ugly, dirty, nasty, quarrelsome, violent, brutal and dishonest."" These latter qualities are the only ones the film really illustrates, ad nauseam.For its first half-hour or so, ""Down and Dirty"" concentrates on a wide range of family antics, which are diverse enough to seem colorful and occasionally funny. Later, it zeroes in on what is more or less a plot: the patriarch, played by Nino Manfredi, has a million lire, his insurance compensation for the loss of his left eye, perhaps poked out in a typical family brawl. He guards his money jealously, which makes the others angry, since their only income is generated by stealing, selling their bodies and performing the most mindless and menial jobs.And the patriarch does something even more infuriating: he takes up with a whore, who is hideously fat but beautiful to him, either because his eyesight is poor or because she's the only woman in the movie who doesn't have whiskers. This is the last straw. The family decides to kill the patriarch, and so they feed him a dinner heavily seasoned with rat poison. He wolfs down the meal, suddenly realizes what has happened, staggers away from the table and  in a moment of bizarre victory  he vomits triumphantly. Mr. Manfredi, whose performance is hard to isolate from all the caterwauling around him, has come a long way from ""Bread and Chocolate,"" that's for sure.""Down and Dirty,"" which opens today at the Paris theater, seems promising until the limitations of Mr. Scola's intention become unmistakable. His method is one of endless repetition, and the heavy-handedness of his approach mixes poorly with the film's overall coarseness. His characters, so stylized and belligerent they become exhausting, are disproportionate with his more general concerns, which are much plainer in their way. And for all Mr. Scola's wallowing in the sordidness of his characters' lives, there's something fatally tentative in his approach. It's as if the film's emphatic freakishness  a one-legged actor, a man with a cauliflower nose, a three-legged dog  were meant to compensate for an essential disgust with the entire subject.",1979-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Players' Takes World Tennis Tour:On the Courts,"CHRIS (Dean-Paul Martin), in his 20's, is an attractive but directionless tennis hustler. In her own way Nicole (Ali MacGraw) is as much without purpose as Chris. She's what fiction of this sort presents as ""an older woman,"" meaning that she's approaching 40 and looks more smashing than most 30-year-olds.Nicole is both beautiful and beautifully kept by an international business tycoon named Marco (Maximilian Schell), who periodically summons Nicole from her Cuernavaca villa to his Mediterranean yacht. In one of her free periods, Nicole and Chris meet on a Mexican highway after her car runs into a tree. All sorts of sparks are immediately struck. One result is that her car, as if having a temper tantrum, blows up. Another is that she and Chris fall in love. Madly.Can Nicole summon up the courage to turn her back on the money, the clothes, the travel, the servants and the fresh flowers, which life with Marco represents, to follow Chris into the unknown world of professional tennis? Will Marco use his power to destroy all that is good and fine and decent between Nicole and Chris? Will Chris win the longest Wimbledon tennis match ever recorded in a fiction film? Do you care?These are some of the questions raised by ""Players,"" a romantic drama told in a series of unreasonably coherent, chronological flashbacks as Chris thinks about his affair with Nicole during his Wimbledon match against Guillermo Vilas. No wonder he doesn't play too well at the start. It's not because Nicole is not sitting in seat No. 30 but because he has Arnold Schulman's dopey screenplay on his mind.It's ironic that although ""Players"" is very much what its producer, Robert Evans, likes to call ""a man-woman-people film,"" the most interesting things in the movie are not the men or the women or the people. Instead they are the exotic settings in Cuernavaca, Monte Carlo, Las Vegas and London, as well as the tennis exhibitions that feature a lot of real-life pros, including Pancho Gonzalez, who appears as Chris's trainer.""Players"" is the sort of movie in which the actors serve the function of scenery. They are nice to look at but it's not really possible to identify with a tree or even a lilac bush. Mr. Schulman's dialogue doesn't help, nor does the direction by Anthony Harvey (""A Lion in Winter""), who never discovers a source of narrative energy to compensate for the emptiness of the characters.The movie unravels in bits and pieces as it cross-cuts between the Wimbledon match and the flashbacks. The sillier the flashbacks become, the more annoying are the interruptions to the game. Miss MacGraw and Mr. Martin, who is a tennis pro in real life and the son of Dean Martin, seem to be nice people but they appear to be very ill at ease in the film's dramatic sequences that, because of the shape of the movie, look like television commercials for products never named.""Players,"" which opens today at Loew's State 1 and the Coronet Theaters, isn't exactly boring. It's pretty and painless and immediately forgettable.""Players,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some midly suggestive sexual encounters and vulgar language.",1979-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Dreamer' Bowls for Rainbows:Alley Style,"I'M not sure I've ever seen a movie that was supposed to tell a story and managed to be as uneventful as ""Dreamer,"" which opens today at neighborhood theaters. Here is this title character  a cockeyed optimist, as you can see  and here is his grand passion: bowling. This is what happens to him during the course of a very long 93 minutes: he wins a couple of trophies. He has car trouble. He bloodies his thumb by overbowling, and one of the friendly barmaids at the bowling alley where he works advises him to rub raw potato on the wound. These waitresses adore Dreamer, but nothing comes of any of it. They all seem to be named Angie.Wait, there's more. Dreamer (Tim Matheson) has a girlfriend (Susan Blakely), who loves him even though he treats her terribly and, as part of the film's dramatic climax, makes him a special shirt with his name embroidered on the sleeve. He also has a coach (Jack Warden), whose motto is ""You don't beat a person, you beat the pins."" This coach eventually bowls himself to death, but his legacy to Dreamer is a special ball, also with his name on it. The movie ends with one last big tournament, at which a sharp-eyed sports-caster observes that Dreamer is ""trying to bring a new dimension to the sport."" ""They'll remember his style, and they'll remember that white satin shirt.""By this juncture, it has become impossible to wonder who'll win or to root for Dreamer at all; as played by Mr. Matheson, he is an arrogant blowhard who spends more than enough time rooting for himself. The only things more grating than the character are a theme song, played at least three different times, about how Dreamer is going to find his end of the rainbow, and incessant plugs for brand-name merchandise, bowling-related and otherwise. And as for bowling-alley ambience, all ""Dreamer"" offers in that department are occasional glimpses of two Hispanic characters whose job is to set up pins. They are represented as being stupid, shiftless and lazy.""Dreamer"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Film: Toy Commandos:A War Movie,"""ESCAPE to Athena,"" which opens today at the National, is a war movie that wants to be lighthearted but is only ridiculous, as well as slipshod and dreary. It's a melodrama set in Greece in 1944 about an unlikely pick-up team of commandos who make possible the Allied invasion of the German-occupied country.The list of the members of the team reads like the cast of a Lew Grade co-production, which this is. They are a Greek patriot (Telly Savalas), an English archeologist (David Niven), an Italian Cook (Sonny Buono), a pair of U.S.O. performers (Elliott Gould and Stefanie Powers), an American serviceman (Richard Roundtree) and a Greek madam (Claudia Cardinale). They are eventually joined in their mission by the Nazi commandant (Roger Moore) of the local prisoner-of-war camp, a plot twist that's explained by the fact that the commandant is Austrian.The film was directed by George P. Cosmatos (""The Cassandra Crossing""), a man who has no sense of humor and such a great fondness for shooting scenes from helicopters that you suspect it's he who wants to escape. The action footage is ludicrous.Mr. Niven remains debonair under taxing circumstances and Miss Powers is attractively brassy with nonexistent material. Mr. Gould and Mr. Buono do everything but wear lampshades to liven things up. The other performers are terrible. Mr. Moore is facetious. Mr. Savalas has the smug, self-absorbed manner of someone modeling his own line of men's leisure wear and jewelry. Even the sunny scenery of the island of Rhodes becomes tiresome. One comes out of the dark theater wishing for a little real shade.""Escape to Athena,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some vulgar language.",1979-06-08T05:00:00+0000

In his messages, John Paul II cheered them and proudly reminded Catholics of the inextricable tie in Poland between national history and the church. He exhorted them to continue to fight the good fight against Communism. He spoke to those whose plight he so well knows, who stand always at the brink of losing heart in their struggle to eke out an existence and keep a spirit of freedom under repression. By showing how Polish he is, bringing the emotional and theological dimensions to religion, sharing the papacy with them, exuding the openness of the Polish people, the Pope gave the church here the precious, indispensible gift of hope. Rubbing shoulders and pledging allegiance to Catholicism in this extraordinary public way has also demonstrated that the faith is being passed to the younger generation.

More significantly, purely in terms of corporate interest, news is a key factor in the overall image of a network or station. There was good reason for ABC, when it leapt to the top of the ratings heap, to devote considerable energy and staggering sums of money to the improvement of its news division. As a result, the ABC News operation today is both vastly improved and far more competitive, coming from a poor third in the ratings to a virtual tie with NBC for second place.

This has become a running story in the press, and is covered with the same blowbyblow attention normally given in this country to prizefights, Supreme Court decisions and corporate proxy struggles. Successive accusations of pricefixing or protectionism against the Japanese are heavily debated and get a wide hearing, though the Japanese (and their American lawyers) rebut the charges as fast as they are made. Even when Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira visited the United States for his first big policy talk with President Carter, he was not able to get past the business pages of most newspapers, apart from occasional mentions when he gave a million dollars each to the Asia Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Although Japan traditionally has been protectionist, most of the speculation in this country about why its economy has flourished misses the mark. The reason for Japan's trade success is still widely given as cheap labor, pricecutting and, more important still, some sort of interlocking conspiracy between government, big business and finance that is called Japan Incorporated.

Both men put Literature before any other Cause, both were linguists, both admired each other's work, both had reason for gratitude to each other and, before the quarrel, enjoyed each other's pugnacity. It is ironical that their common passion for the genius of Pushkin became the eventual cause of the flareup of their tempers when Wilson's searing review of Nabokov's fourvolume annotated translation of Eiigene Onegin appeared in The New York Review of Books in 1965. Six years after the public quarrel, when Nabokov reread the whole batth of their correspondence, he wrote to Wilson of the thrills of their friendship and said, Please believe that I have long ceased to bear you a grudge for your incomprehensible uncomprehension of Pushkin's and Nabokov's Onegin.

His first job in the city was teaching Portuguese at the New School for Social Research. Then he worked for a furniture company, applying gold leaf and antiquing pieces. One day, a customer asked for queensize brass bed. By the time the fourth person asked me the same thing, I had decided that it was time to bring back to life something that people had forgotten about, said Mr. Isabel. Now he has a company that specializes in brass bed frames. But, he said, instead of stamping sheets of solid brass, we work with brass castings, or solid rod fittings, that are handcarved on a lathe. The headboards and bed frames don't have a beer can feeling, he said, but are heavy and sturdy. In time, Mr. Isabel added, the brass will look like that of an old bed that turns green, and you have to spend hours cleaning it. Mr. Isabel likes that. The patina looks better a few years after you buy the bed. He believes that a brass bed is an investment, because the price of the base is going up all the time. He will make any size frame or headboard, in any style. Delivery, depending on the nature of the design, takes six to 10 weeks. The price for a queensize headboard starts at about $350; a head, foot and frame set starts at $595. Isabel Brass Furniture is at 120 East 32d Street.

us,"Film: 'Kirlian Witness,' Parapsychology in SoHo:Only the Plants Know","THOUGH occultism seems a lazy way of dealing with life, stories of the occult can be fun when, like ""The Turn of the Screw"" or even ""Dracula,"" they operate according to the laws of their own consistent, if completely mysterious, universes. Too often, however, they are inconsistent as well as lazy, which more or less describes ""The Kirlian Witness,"" a first feature by Jonathan Sarno.""The Kirlian Witness"" is a movie that sort of dabbles in parapsychology, being about a plant that fingers (leafs?) a murder suspect. The low-budget, independent movie, which opens tonight at the Film Forum, is quite nicely acted by its New York cast and makes good use of its lower Manhattan locales, but there's no way to sit through the inanities of its plot and the deadpan understatements of its dialogue without wanting to hoot a lot.This is the story of Rilla, a photographer who lives in a SoHo loft with her husband, Robert, an architect, and just one floor above her sister Laurie, a taciturn kook who invites strange men into her plant-laden apartment to meditate and screams hysterically if they make passes at her.The film opens with Rilla, who is the narrator as well as the heroine, glumly recalling events she describes as ""this mess.""""If anyone was left holding the bag,"" says Rilla, ""it was me,"" which, considering that ""this mess"" involves three murders, including those of her sister and someone else close to her, must be the least adequate introduction to a movie in the history of the cinema.Mr. Sarno and Lamar Sanders, who take credit for the screenplay, seem to be writers who can't cope with their own narrative inventions. Instead of being logical, they wring their hands. When Rilla finds Laurie very dead  murdered  on the roof of their loft building, does she scream or yell or fly into some other kind of panic? No. She just becomes very quickly sad and goes downstairs  one suspects  to think about it.The pursuit of the killer  and this is where the parapsychology comes in  leads Rilla to conduct her own experiments in communication with plants, including Laurie's favorite, a rhododendron so sickly looking that I hoped it would turn out to be a romantic poet.The cast is headed by Nancy Snyder (Rilla), the pretty blond actress who was so good as Joan of Arc in the Off Off Broadway production of Jules Feiffer's ""Knock, Knock"" but who was replaced by Lynn Redgrave when the producers fancified the show for its Broadway failure. Joel Colodner plays Rilla's husband, and Ted Leplat appears as an unreliable handyman, the sort who comes in to fix the tub and then, uninvited, takes a bath in it.""The Kirlian Witness"" will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45 o'clock and repeated next Thursday through Sunday at the same time.",1979-06-14T05:00:00+0000

Then I was wiping my eyes. Then I forgot to take any more notes. And now I can't remember exactly what was so funny. When anything is thatfunny, though, maybe the fine points don't matter.""The In-Laws"" is certainly not a movie for anyone interested in fine points. As directed by Arthur Hiller, it is, at best, a happy shambles, and it gets off to a muddy start. A Federal security truck is robbed, with the theft masterminded by Peter Falk; not so interesting, since Mr. Falk has lately been seen plotting a similar heist in ""The Brink's Job."" But wait. The truck is full of money, and the thieves don't even want it; they're after something else. This is the first of a number of new wrinkles.It is dinnertime, and Mr. Falk and Alan Arkin are meeting for the first time. Mr. Arkin is playing one of the world's foremost dentists, and surely Mr. Falk is playing one of the world's great straight men. The dentist's daughter is scheduled to be married only a day or two later to the robber's son, but a lot will be happening between now and then.Mr. Falk, asked about his work, is a little vague. But he says it took him to Guatemala, and tells some stories about tse-tse flies as big as eagles. The next day, at lunch with Mr. Arkin, he is more candid: he claims he is with the Central Intelligence Agencey. That, he says, is why he has never heard of ""The Price Is Right."" And presumably it also explains the autographed picture of former President John F. Kennedy on his office wall, a picture that has something to do with something he did in Cuba. ""To Vince,"" it says. ""At least we tried.""In no time, Mr. Falk has implicated Mr. Arkin in a Federal crime and whisked him aboard a tiny plane with a two-man Chinese crew. (""You know, if Chiang had ever made it back to mainland China, Billy and Bing would be anchoring the evening news,"" Mr. Falk calmly explains.) Soon they are in a Carribean hotel, with a lobby full of live chickens. Then they are visiting a friend of Mr. Falk's, a crazy General (Richard Libertini), whose art collection Mr. Arkin is quietly advised to admire. The art collection, which is best left undescribed, is the funniest thing in this altogether sidesplitting movie.Andrew Bergman has written one of those rare comedy scripts that escalates steadily and hilariously, without faltering or even having to strain for an ending. As for Mr. Arkin and Mr. Falk, it is theirs, and not their children's, match that has been made in heaven. The teaming of their characters  milquetoast meets entrepreneur  is reminiscent of ""The Producers."" But instead of exaggerating either extreme, both actors play it almost deadpan.However wild things get, Mr. Falk is always willing to offer an extremely patient explanation. And Mr. Arkin is always willing to try, however unsuccessfully, not to scream. If either of them has ever been more delightful, I can't remember when.""The In-Laws"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few mild obscenities.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Walk Proud' Is Upbeat Gang Movie:West Coast Story,"""WALK PROUD,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is a gang movie that is reassuringly upbeat in an old-fashioned sort of way. Based on an original screenplay by Evan Hunter, who wrote ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" the granddaddy of all gang movies, it stars Robby Benson, in dark face, as a member of an East Los Angeles Chicano gang who decides, after much violence and with the help of a good young woman, to seek a better life.The movie has the kind of positive narrative that one associates with movies made under the old Production Code, when wrongdoing was supposed to be promptly punished and sex was mainly a meeting of small minds. ""Walk Proud"" isn't quite that old-fashioned  it talks dirty enough and some of the gang's encounters are fairly brutal; yet it's a movie that still seems to believe there are tangible rewards for the clean of heart. The movie's sentimental, realistic style has nothing whatsoever to do with the dreamlike, glossy cool affected by Walter Hill's notorious ""The Warriors.""Yet ""Walk Proud"" may well be a far more revolutionary picture than the randomly pretty Hill film. In the way it documents the power plays of the Aztecas, the Chicano gang, as its members negotiate and then break treaties covering such things as safe passage through Santa Monica, it manages to suggest the self-generating absurdities built into all international relations conducted through power blocs. When at the end of ""Walk Proud,"" Emilio (Mr. Benson) turns his back on the Aztecas and says, ""I want something else,"" he could be turning his back on the East, the West and the third world.This may be to freight the scheme of the film with more meanings than it can carry. Robert Collins, whose first theatrical film this is, has directed it with the kind of modest efficiency typical of the better television series. The movie doesn't waste time on nonessential details, though it makes free use of street language and likes to toss a love song onto the soundtrack to be sure we get an essential point of emotion.Starting with Mr. Benson, the members of the cast are fine. These include Sarah Holcomb, who plays the WASPy girl with whom Emilio falls in love; Pepe Serna, Domingo Ambriz and Trinidad Silva, as three of Emilio's pals, and Ji-Tu Cumbuka as a black police sergeant who attempts, without much success, to monitor the activities of the Aztecas.""Walk Proud,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains the expected rough language and some scenes of gang violence.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Frankenheimer's 'Prophecy':Mercury, Lukewarm","""PROPHECY"" is a very small horror movie that pretends to be as big as all outdoors. It's about the dreadful effects of a mercury compound that has been used for 20 years at a lumber mill on the ecology of rural Maine. Raccoons lose their minds and attack tourists with the frenzy of rug peddlers. Tadpoles attain the size of salmon, and salmon the size of dolphin.Worst of all are the human mutants, rubberized monsters that, as babies, look like failed Barbie dolls and, as adults, specially in the long shots, like stunt men wearing grizzly bear suits. Even Maine looks very different. It has suddenly become as dramatically scenic and snow-capped as British Columbia, not because the landscape, as if to repel the mercury, has thrown up strange new mountain ranges, but because British Columbia is where this epically trivial movie was made.""Prophecy"" is the work of the gifted John Frankenheimer, the director of ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""The Gypsy Moths"" and ""Black Sunday."" and it was written by the not-so-gifted but staggeringly successful David Seltzer, who wrote ""The Omen."" This time, Mr. Seltzer makes a feeble attempt to recycle the sort of formula movie one expects from American International Pictures. ""Prophecy"" is pretty much the same plot we got several years ago in American International's unintentionally hilarious ""Food of the Gods.""The principal characters of the piece are a crusading young doctor and his wife (Robert Foxworth and Talia Shire), an angry young Indian and his wife (Armand Assante and Victoria Racimo), a shortsighted executive of the lumber mill (Richard Dysart) and an elderly Indian (George Clutesi), who thinks he has special spiritual powers when, in reality, his mind has turned to mush.Mr. Frankenheimer treats this material with the kind of majesty usually reserved for movies about Cleopatra, Napoleon and General Patton. ""Prophecy,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, is full of lingering lap-dissolves and elegant camera movements that suggest history is being made. Leonard Rosenman's soundtrack music is so grand it could be played at a coronation, and it's so loud that it pierces the ears and threatens the head.None of this fits the movie, which includes a fight between a man with an ax and a man with a portable power saw, and a number of attacks by the mutant monsters on random campers and forest rangers as well as on the film's principal players. For extra gore, there's the obligatory decapitation and the strong suggestion that one fellow is bitten in half at the waist.As monsters go, the ones in ""Prophecy"" are less fun and far less mysterious than Godzilla.""Prophecy,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains the violence described above.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Wild Flowers' Is Wry Yugoslav Idyll:For the Simple Life,"""THE Fragrance of Wild Flowers,"" a new Yugoslav film at the Quad today, gets off to a promising start, and remains rewarding for a good long while. We meet a dour-looking man, an actor, and we surmise immediately that he must be a person of great talent, because no one would otherwise put up with him. Indeed, he turns out to to be an international movie star who's sick and tired of his career. He wants to lead a simple life, and smell the flowers  hence the title. And so, without a thought for his co-workers, he walks out on a play he has been scheduled to star in on the day of the premiere. This is Step One in his plan to leave behind his old life and embark on a new one.This, it turns out, is not easily done. When the actor moves onto a barge  run by his old friend, a simple fisherman, and the fisherman's very down-to-earth mistress  he is followed by a film crew. The theater group also tags along, hoping to coax him back to work. They all sit at a tavern on the Danube, right beside the spot where the barge is moored. While waiting for something to happen, they admire the tripe and a singing waitress.All of this finds its way into the headlines, and tourists arrive. Soon, the waitress has show business aspirations, and the tripe is being touted as a delicacy. As for the actor and his simple life, well, he seems to have miscalculated somewhere along the line.Until it gets out of hand  as does the ever-expanding circus that surrounds the actor  this film by Srdjan Karanovic is wry, richly textured and very impressive. The characters seem to have been choreographed rather than directed, as they swarm around the actor, make bargains or strike up expedient friendships. Several marriages and one death result from this almost dreamlike idyll, which takes place on a broad and imaginative scale. But Mr. Karanovic's mounting cynicism, which leads the film to a disappointingly pat finale, proves more and more limiting as the story progresses.As the actor, Ljuba Tadic effortlessly gives the film weight, though he seldom speaks and never smiles. He hovers compellingly between self-importance and true gravity, making the other characters look all the more frivolous by comparison, save for the fisherman's mistress, the only one whose instinct is to cut the actor down to size. The barge she lives on is other worldly in a way that suggests Jean Vigo's mysterious boat in ""L'Atalante.""The music, by Zoran Simujanovic, is lovely, and it enhances this mood of eerie detachment. ""The Fragrance of Wild Flowers"" was the winner of the International Critics Award at Cannes, France, last year.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Rocky II' Fights a Rematch:Second Stanza....,"WHAT happens to Rocky in ""Rocky II,"" which opens today at the Cinerama and at neighborhood theaters, is a lot like what happened to Sylvester Stallone. Last seen ""going the distance"" in his one-in-a-million fight with the World Champion, Rocky is still at it when Part II begins; the new film actually replays the ending of the old one. But after the first flush of success is behind him, Rocky flounders. And after an extended period of floundering, he realizes that the only way he can match that early triumph is to duplicate it as closely as possible. In Rocky's case, this means agreeing to a rematch with the Champ. In Mr. Stallone's, it means trying to make the same movie all over again.The extent to which Mr. Stallone, who wrote and directed ""Rocky II,"" has been able to use his ""Rocky"" script as a blueprint is remarkable. After all, ""Rocky"" was the story of an ostensible nobody who made good, and at the start of Mr. Stallone's new story Rocky is a big hero. No matter; once the swelling goes down he turns into a nobody all over again.He spends the prize money on presents for himself, his old dog and his new wife. (He and Talia Shire get married as the new story begins.) He buys a house. After that, he can't get a job. Two of his former lines of work, boxing and breaking thumbs, don't interest him any more on account of the wear and tear. All he can find is a part-time job in a meat-packing plant, and even that comes to nothing. He gets laid off.Only one person really remembers him  Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the Champ. The Champ has been getting hate mail saying he didn't really beat Rocky fair and square and, according to Mr. Stallone's script, the accusations are driving him crazy. So he takes out newspaper ads trying to goad Rocky into a rematch. The ads call Rocky ""The Italian Chicken"" instead of ""The Italian Stallion.""This is the point at which Mr. Stallone, who has done a creditable job on the whole, begins to turn superstitious. After having wandered far afield of his original formula in ""F*I*S*T"" and ""Paradise Alley,"" he has returned to it with rather an uneasy vengeance. This is evidenced by the many scenes showing Rocky praying in the new film and by the abundance of good-luck totems.The same cast is back. So are the same turtles. Likewise the gang of street singers on Rocky's corner, led by Mr. Stallone's brother. The music, again by Bill Conti, is almost identical, and indeed the old ""Rocky"" theme is reprised for the sequence  yes  in which Rocky again jogs through Philadelphia in his same old gray sweatsuit, training for the fight. This time he is followed by about 800 admiring schoolchildren, presumably kids of strong stamina.The thing Mr. Stallone is most afraid to touch, and the thing that most needs tampering with, is Rocky's navet. The evanescence of his triumph is sad, but Rocky is not allowed to feel sorry about that; he barely even notices. And, more problematically, he is not allowed any feelings of ambition or rivalry that might correspond to the Champ's, and hence liven up the fight. Mr. Stallone works very hard to establish that Rocky wouldn't fight if he didn't have to. But this makes the buildup to the match seem aimless, and that's about half the movie. And it makes the final scenes all the more brutal, since Rocky  who is this time only making a career move, more or less  winds up looking like steak tartare.Mr. Stallone, whose direction borrows a lot from John Avildsen's direction of the first film (except for some bizarre lapses into slow motion, a touch that is purely Mr. Stallone's own), gives the same kind of unexpectedly affable performance he gave the first time. All the uneasiness of his intervening films has disappeared. Nevertheless, ""Rocky II"" has a waxy feeling, and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did. As the characters go through their stock routines  Talia Shire shyly whispering ""I love you,"" Mr. Stallone making self-deprecating jokes, Burgess Meredith telling the kid he's either a bum or a hero  you get the feeling that you've been here before. Well, you have.""Rocky II"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). The fight with which it concludes is indeed a bloody one.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Witty 'Goldengirl':Nurtured to Win,"""GOLDENGIRL,"" which opens today at Loews State 2 and other theaters, is something of an oddity  a cross between a science-fiction film and a horror film in which there are no spaceships and few futuristic gadgets. It has a monster, but the monster possesses the astonishingly lifelike shape of Susan Anton, the tall, blond, California-born actress, model and singer, best known nationally as the television spokeswoman for Muriel cigars.The melodrama, directed by Joseph Sargent and adapted by John Kohn from a novel by Peter Lear, is set in 1980 and is about the attempts of a mad but mannerly neo-Nazi doctor, played by Curt Jurgens, to produce a superwoman. The guinea pig is his adopted daughter, Goldine (Miss Anton), who has been specially fed, exercised and physically and emotionally conditioned since childhood to become a track star, more specifically, to win three gold medals for running at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.To finance his project, the old scientist has sold shares in his daughter's future earnings to a group of businessmen, who, in turn, have brought in a merchandising wizard, played by James Coburn, to insure that they get their money's worth.""Goldengirl"" is a wittily conceived and executed movie that, with the straightest of faces, manages to satirize the kind of big business that surrounds so-called amateur sports today. It also sends up science and science-fiction while getting in a few jabs at a civilization that systematically pollutes its environment for short-term gains.The environment here is the amazing Goldine, also called Goldengirl, and she's splendid. She's an Alp that walks, talks, runs, smiles and in all other ways is extremely human, but who may now and then say something like, ""I'm just a simple American girl born to win three Olympic gold medals.""Though Goldine thinks she was born in this shape, we in the audience know better (or worse). Goldine didn't come naturally by her extraordinary size and talent. Since she was a little girl, her father has been stabbing her with long needles that didn't contain the vitamins he said, but all sorts of strange hormones, which eventually do her no good. Inside that magnificent body, a terrible wasteland is being created.""Goldengirl"" is a very intelligent movie of its kind, written and directed in the same brisk style that marked Mr. Sargent's earlier ""Colossus  The Forbin Project."" If the producers aren't entirely successful in persuading us that the scenes shot at the 1980 Moscow Olympics were really shot there, that's not as important as the effectiveness of the performers. They're all good, particularly Mr. Jurgens, who not many years ago was playing Werner von Braun as a hero; Mr. Coburn, and Leslie Caron, who appears as Goldine's in-house behavioral psychologist.The star, though, is Miss Anton. Farrah Fawcett-Majors clone or not, she's a sight for sore eyes, and I suspect she may also be a very acceptable actress. This is not intended to put down what she does here, which is quite a lot. It's only to admit that it's difficult to understand a phenomenon as spectacular as this after a single viewing. She's one sunrise I'd like to see again.""Goldengirl,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some vulgar language and one slightly suggestive situation.",1979-06-15T05:00:00+0000

""Have you tried Hare Krishna?"" replies Kermit. One thing leads to another and the agent persuades Kermit that there's a future in Hollywood for a frog of his talents.""The Muppet Movie"" is the last word in ""road"" pictures, being the story of Kermit's crazy cross-country trip to Hollywood, much of it in the company of Fozzie the Bear, who drives not well but often..""Ah,"" says Fozzie as they go swerving down life's highway, ""a bear in his natural habitat! A Studebaker!"" The Muppets they meet and take aboard are extremely good company, as are their friends, including Mr. DeLuise, Mel Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Milton Berle, Orson Welles and Richard Pryor, each of whom turns up briefly. The trip, though, is not all bread, honey and flies. Kermit is pursued relentlessly by Doc Hopper (Charles Durning), the greedy, ambitious head of a fast-food chain specializing in deep-fried frogs legs. Doc sees himself as the rival of Colonel Sanders if he can persuade Kermit to be his spokesman on television. That, naturally, is an offer that Kermit rejects. ""All I can see,"" says Kermit, suppressing a tear, ""is a million frogs on tiny crutches.""At one point Doc Hopper hires a mad scientist, played by Mr. Brooks, who attempts to change Kermit by subjecting him to what he calls ""an electronic cerebrectomy."" Miss Piggy, a karate expert, saves the day and wins Kermit's respect.One of the movie's funniest sequences is a montage that dramatizes in lyrical slow-motion how Kermit and Miss Piggy discover their love as they gambol across meadows, stop by a waterfall and punt across a still lake until their passion takes control. I should stress, though, that ""The Muppet Movie"" is always discreet.It's also very well written by Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns and directed by James Frawley (""Kid Blue,"" ""The Big Bus"") with a comic touch that never becomes facetious.I'm in particular awe of the techniques by which these hand puppets are made to walk, run, sing and play musical instruments.

us,Screen: 'Alcatraz' Opens:With Clint Eastwood,"DON SIEGEL'S ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is not a great film or an especially memorable one, but there is more evident skill and knowledge of movie making in any one frame of it than there are in most other American films around at the moment. It's the kind of movie that could be more profitably studied in film courses than all of the works of Bergman and Fellini combined. That's not to say that Mr. Siegel (""Dirty Harry,"" ""The Beguilded,"" ""Riot in Cell Block 11,"" etc.) outweighs those masters but that film students have a way of leaping into the art while still ignorant of the craft. Craft is something that a Siegel film demonstrates without half trying.""Escape From Alcatraz"" is based on, and is a speculation upon, the true story of the successful escape of three men from San Francisco's island-prison in 1960. Because neither the men nor their bodies were ever found, many of the film's details, I assume, are the work of the screenwriter, Richard Tuggle, and J. Campbell Bruce, who wrote a book about the case.What Mr. Siegel has made is fiction, a first-rate action movie that is about the need and the decision to take action, as well as the action itself. In this particular case, the action is the escape from ""the rock,"" a maneuver masterminded by a tough con named Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) with two cronies, Clarence Anglin (Jack Thibeau) and John Anglin (Fred Ward).In such movies, characters function primarily as components of the movement. It's with something of a shock that you realize at the end of the film you still know hardly anything about the fellow Mr. Eastwood plays, neither why he was in prison to start with nor anything about his life outside. When someone asks him, ""What kind of childhood did you have?"" his answer is sufficient to the circumstances. ""Short,"" he says.This kind of terseness is characteristic of the entire movie, which opens with Frank Morris being escorted to Alcatraz under armed guard, late at night, during a heavy rainstorm. From that sequence on, the audience, like Frank Morris, is on the inside peering out. The movie operates entirely within the present tense. We don't worry about Frank Morris's past, only about what's happening now.Mr. Siegel evokes the dehumanizing routine of Alcatraz life so vividly that the film's principal question is not if he's going to escape, but how. Says the warden (Patrick McGoohan), a fellow to warm the heart of Captain Bligh, as he explains the prison's lack of any rehabilitation programs: ""We don't make good citizens. We make good prisoners.""As Mr. Siegel and his screenwriter have not provided their characters with lengthy case histories, they have also refrained from imposing on the film hints of larger meanings. The meanings are there if you want to search, but they aren't spelled out as if to justify the existence of the film.In a couple of brief sequences, ""Escape From Alcatraz"" looks as if it were going to succumb to sentiment, but mostly it's tough in the way that Sam Peckinpah's films once were, before he began to take himself so seriously. I should also add that it's terrifically exciting.Mr. Eastwood fulfills the demands of the role and of the film as probably no other actor could. Is it acting? I don't know, but he's the towering figure in its landscape. Among the fine supporting performances are those of Roberts Blossom, Frank Ronzio, Bruce M. Fischer, Larry Hankin and Mr. McGoohan, who pushes unmotivated nastiness to its outer reaches.The movie opens today at the Forum and Trans-Lux East Theaters.""Escape from Alcatraz,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some explicit violence and bloodshed and obscene language.",1979-06-22T05:00:00+0000

He: ""My name is David....as in Camp David?"" She: ""You're kidding! That's you?""Most of the film is not on this elevated level. It's about a high-powered cosmetics executive, played by Barbra Streisand, who, after her accountant runs off with her fortune, tries to recoup by managing a prizefighter whose contract she had bought earlier for tax-loss purposes.The prizefighter, played by Ryan O'Neal, doesn't want to fight because he doesn't like to get hurt. He much prefers to run a driving school that's in the shape of a boxing glove. Barbra pushes him. He holds back. With Barbra as the go-getting aggressor and Ryan as the passive nincompoop, they fall in love.This sort of situation could only be funny if it's out of character, and it is out of character for Mr. O'Neal. The pushy cosmetics executive, however, seems to be an extension of the role played in real-life by Miss Streisand, who coproduced the movie, stars in it and seems to have ordered every close-up and line-reading. Miss Streisand has become a contradiction: she's too much without being enough.In her early films  ""Funny Girl,"" ""On a Clear Day,"" ""What's Up Doc?"" and even ""Hello, Dolly,"" she gave signs of attempting to stretch her talent. Now that she's appearing in her own, made-to-order productions, the talent appears to have shrunk and become inflexible. The performance here is blunt, rude, unpleasant and inescapable. At one point the camera even follows her to her exercise class, a scene that has no purpose except to demonstrate that she's limber, something of more interest to her immediate family, perhaps, than to us slobs in Movieland.The two supporting actors who supply comic first-aid from time to time are Paul Sand and Patti D'Arbanville. Whitman Mayo is also funny as Mr. O'Neal's wise, skeptical trainer.Gail Parent (""Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York"") and Andrew Smith wrote the screenplay, which was directed by Howard Zieff (""Slither,"" ""Hearts of the West""). With any other star-producer they might have made this into the zany comedy I think they had in mind. Miss Streisand obviously doesn't need advice from the likes of them.""The Main Event,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some suggestive situations and dialogue.",1979-06-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Audrey Hepburn in 'Bloodline':International Intrigue,"""SIDNEY Sheldon's Bloodline,"" based on the recent Sheldon novel that sold well, is both better and worse than the film version of Sidney Sheldon's ""The Other Side of Midnight,"" which was apparently made before Mr. Sheldon's agent had the clout to squeeze the Sheldon name into the title. ""Bloodline"" has a more attractive, more able cast, including Audrey Hepburn, James Mason, Ben Gazzara, Beatrice Straight and Gert Frbe and it has a lot more scenery (Sardinia, New York, London, Paris, Switzerland), but it seems constructed entirely of loose ends and superfluous information. ""The Other Side of Midnight"" was the undisputed junk-movie of its year, but it made a certain amount of narrative sense. ""Bloodline"" doesn't.The film, which opens today at the Loews Tower East and other theaters, pretends to be the story of a great international drug combine controllled by a family that's to pharmaceuticals what the Rothschilds were once to banking.When the family patriarch dies, the control of the company passes to his once-elfin daughter Elizabeth (Audrey Hepburn), whom we first meet in New York's American Museum of Natural History where she appears to be painting the rib cage of a dinosaur that's in process of being reconstituted.From this I think we're meant to believe that Elizabeth is some sort of anthropologist, but because it's never mentioned again, we begin to suspect toward the end of the film that she really wasn't working on the dinosaur but just looking for an earring lost the night before at a charity ball.As soon as Elizabeth takes control of the company at a board meeting in Zurich, it's apparent that the same person or persons who got dad are after her. The suspects, who aren't too numerous to mention, include handsome, suave Rhys Williams (Ben Gazzara), who was her father's chief aide, and various greedy cousins who want the company to go public, thus to sell their stock profitably. They include Sir Alec Nichols (James Mason), based in London, Ivo Palazzi (Omar Sharif) in Rome; and Helene Martine (Romy Schneider) in Paris, along with their various spouses.While Elizabeth is asserting her control of the international pharmaceutical market, people keep trying to bump her off. When she climbs into her Jeep to drive to the airport, the brakes fail. Someone cuts the cables to the elevator she almost boards. Standing on a Swiss ski slope, she narrowly misses death when a snowmobile brushes by her.As somebody is trying to tell her something, the movie makers are trying to tell us something, for running parallel to these events, is a subplot about the murders of a number of prostitutes whose lives are snuffed out in the course of shooting porn films. What is the connection to poor Elizabeth? Tenuous.As he demonstrated in his James Bond films (""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball""), Terence Young is a director of some comic style, but though ""Bloodline"" is often laughable, it has no sense of humor. It's the kind of fiction that is glumly disapproving of its own sordid details, such as one about a lady who has her knees nailed to the floor (offscreen) for not paying her gambling debts. ""Bloodline"" takes Miss Hepburn's Givenchy clothes more seriously than it does the actress who wears them, not always becomingly. Under these circumstances, there's no reason to comment on the quality of the individual performances",1979-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Moonraker' Puts Bond in Orbit:Old, Old Friends","AT a time when everything is being either inflated or devalued it's comforting to know that at least one commodity maintains its hard currency. That's James Bond, who, by all rights, should be an antique, as emblematic of the 60's as the Beatles and flowerpower, but who goes blithely on as if time has had a stop.""Moonraker,"" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, is the 11th in the remarkable series that began in 1963 with ""Dr. No"" and it's one of the most bouyant Bond films of all. It looks as if it cost an unconscionable amount of money to make, though it has nothing on its mind except dizzying entertainment, which is not something to dismiss quickly in such a dreary, disappointing movie season.What's it about? That's a silly question, though I suppose one might answer that it's about sleight of handsthose of all the people who worked on it. They include the indefatigable producer, Albert R. Broccoli (also known as Cubby), Lewis Gilbert, who directed it, Christopher Wood, who wrote the screenplay, Ken Adam, the production designer, and all of those far from little people who are responsible for the extraordinary tricks that persuade us to suspend our disbelief.Mr. Wood's screenplay begins when a United States space-shuttle craft mysteriously disappears as it's being ferried to England on the back of a Boeing 747. The fiend behind this remarkable theft is a French-accented American aeronautics tycoon named Drax (Michael Lonsdale), an eccentric fellow who lives in California in a transplanted French chateau and who surrounds himself with astronauts, all of whom are between the ages of 18 and 25, beautiful and female.The space-shuttle craft, called Moonraker, was actually built by Drax's company, so the mystery that James Bond (Roger Moore) must solve is why Drax would feel the need to hijack his own product. The trail leads from London to California to Venice to Rio de Janeiro and, after that, to Drax's jungle hideaway that takes in bits and pieces of settings filmed in Guatemala and Argentina as well as Brazil. Among other things ""Moonraker"" deals in creative geography. The climactic duel occurs in the only location leftouter space.""Moonraker,"" like all of the better Bond pictures, returns us to a kind of film making that I most closely associate with the 15-part serials of my youth. Our astonishment depends on the ingenuity by which the writers and directors disentangle Bond from the impossible situations into which he seems to fall every seven minutes.""Moonraker"" begins with one of the funniest and most dangerous (as well as most beautifully photographed and edited) sequences Bond has ever faced. He's booted out of an airplane without a parachute and must do mortal combat, during a swooping, soaring free-fall, with an adversary who, luckily, does have a parachute. There are also a high-speed chase through Venetian canals (with one gondola a disguised Hovercraft), another chase on the Amazon, a fight on the roof of the funicular that goes to the top of Rio's Sugar Loaf mountain, and a final confrontation in space that is as handsome as anything in ""Star Wars.""What's it about? It's about movie making of the kind Georges Mlis pioneered in films like ""Voyage to the Moon"" (1902) and ""Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"" (1907). It's the unimaginable most satisfactorily imagined.Almost everyone connected with the movie is in top form, even Mr. Moore who has a tendency to facetiousness when left to his own devices. Here he's as ageless, resourceful and graceful as the character he inhabits. Mr. Lonsdale is sometimes uncomfortably wooden and square, but then he's not supposed to be a barrel of laughs. Lois Chiles is lovely as Bond's Central Intelligence Agency vis--vis, who's just one of the sexually tireless Bond's conquests. Richard Kiel reappears as Bond's thug-enemy, the gigantic Jaws, who, you may be happy to learn, undergoes the kind of character transformation that means he'll probably turn up in yet another Bond film. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell, as, respectively, ""M"" and Miss Moneypenny, also are on hand.Welcome back to old friends.""Moonraker,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some suggestive situations and comically overstated violence.",1979-06-29T05:00:00+0000

No, according to Arthur Hiller's not very horrifying new movie, ""Nightwing.""Hollywood's apocalyptic visions of mankind's doom have fingered locusts, grasshoppers, bees, Spanish moss, rabbits, frogs, sharks, worms, ants and carrots. ""Nightwing"" accuses vampire bats. Now I suppose bats  all bats  are innately more disturbing than Spanish moss and carrots, but as they are pictured in ""Nightwing,"" they seem a good deal less ferocious than sharks or even ants obsessed with going their own way.""Nightwing,"" which opens today at Loew's State 2 and other theaters, is set in the Southwest and adds one tiny variation to the familiar story, which is the one about nature being out of control. The two principal characters are American Indians. One, named Duran (Nick Mancuso) talks so elegantly you might think he were in a reservation production of ""The Importance of Being Ernest."" The other, Chee (Stephen Macht), wears modish sports clothes and uses the language of a Hollywood talent agent. ""Not to worry, Roger,"" he calls cheerily over the telephone to someone who wants to buy the oil rights to the Indian land.The two other major characters are Anne Dillon (Kathryn Harrold), a pretty young white woman who works with Indians and loves Duran, and Philip Payne (David Warner), an English-born bat-killer who pursues his work with the scary dedication of the fanatic. Mr. Warner is quite funny  intentionally, I suspect  when he attempts to explain his fanaticism. He fairly shakes with moral indignation as he describes a typical bat cave with ""millions of bats wrestling, fighting, mating, hanging upside down . . . They are the quintessence of eeevilll!""Mr. Hiller (""The In-Laws,"" ""The Hospital,"" ""Love Story,"") is credited as the director of the film but it looks as if it had been put together from a child's instruction book. The screenplay, based on a novel by Martin Cruz Smith, is terrible and the special effects third-rate.""Nightwing,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains some vulgar language and several scenes that make free use of fake blood.",1979-06-29T05:00:00+0000

More amazingly, they stand up and come back for more after receiving the sort of punishment that would fell a rhinoceros.The notion upon which the film is based, that a raid late in the Vietnam War to free a group of captured Central Intelligence Agency operatives failed because the North Vietnamese knew it was coming, is not without promise.In fact, such an operation was actually attempted during the war. The film's scenes of nighttime close combat have a verisimilitude lacking in many more ambitious films. But that's about all that can be said on the credit side for ""Good Guys Wear Black.""Under the circumstances, there's little that Ted Post, who directed ""Magnum Force,"" can do to bring the movie alive.
