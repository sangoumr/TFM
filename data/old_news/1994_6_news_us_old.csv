us,SIMINT SELLS ARMANI A/X CHAIN TO SINGAPORE COMPANY,"Simint S.p.A., an Italian clothing company controlled by the designer Giorgio Armani, said today that it had sold Armani A/X, its money-losing United States retailing chain of 41 stores, to the Singapore-based company Ong Beng Seng as part of a restructuring. The Simint board accepted Ong Beng Seng's offer of 20 billion lire ($12.5 million) for Simint U.S.A., which owns the Armani A/X stores. The sale of Simint U.S.A. results in an additional loss of 52 billion lire for Mr. Armani's company. Simint S.p.A. had said its loss through the first 10 months of the fiscal year that ended in April was 184 billion lire ($115 million), because it had been forced to write down 150 billion lire in assets that had been overvalued. It has covered that loss out of reserves. Simint S.p.A. said it would turn a profit this year if all the features of its restructuring plan were put into effect.",1994-06-01T05:00:00+0000

Although the milieu invoked in this exhibition has evolved since Wharton's day, the struggle laid out in these rooms remains vivid and compelling in the way that the story of rebellion often does. It was once said of Edith Wharton and her friend Theodore Roosevelt that that they were both self-made. This is the true subject at the National Academy: how Edith Wharton, born into Old New York of the 1860's and raised in it during the 1870's and 1880's, found her way out of it -- and fully into her own life -- by the first decade of this century.",1994-06-03T05:00:00+0000

A1 A RWANDAN TOWN, ERASED In a village in eastern Rwanda, a large white statue of Jesus still looks down on a scene of mass slaughter carried out in mid-April. Only corpses and the sound of wind remains in Nyarubuye, a town typical of those devastated by regular army troops or Hutu militiamen during two months of civil war. A1 A DEADLY ISRAELI RAID IN LEBANON Israeli planes pounded a training camp of a pro-Iranian group in eastern Lebanon, killing dozens of guerrillas. It was one of Israel's bloodiest raids into Lebanon in years. A1 CLINTON BACKS ITALY'S LEADERS Beginning his European trip, President Clinton became the first major world leader to openly endorse the new Italian Government, which for the first time includes neo-Fascists. His visit to Rome also revived a disagreement with Pope John Paul II over abortion. A10 A SPRING GAMBOL THROUGH ROME Reporter's notebook: Openly thrilled to be away from the land of Paula Jones and Dan Rostenkowski, Bill and Hillary Clinton held hands and laughed as they roamed Rome. A10 Fifty years after the G.I.'s left, Italians still play baseball.

But the trip to the southern Yemeni city can still be made in the traditional wooden ships known as dhows. A4 Northern Yemeni forces pledged to honor a cease-fire call. A5 GET RID OF ARMY, ARISTIDE URGES In an interview in Washington, Haiti's exiled President said he doubted that an economic embargo could restore him to office and urged ""action to get rid of the thugs"" who overthrew him. It is the strongest statement Father Aristide has made in favor of military intervention. A3 Defying the President, Ukrainians decided to hold elections.

But no: even as unemployment plunged to 6 percent in May (with the Northeast's rate falling to 6.3 percent from 7 percent), the lowest level since November 1990, payrolls rose just 191,000, far below expectations. The stock market had held its breath all week -- up a point, down a point -- waiting for this job signal, but then didn't know what to make of it. At first the Dow fell 16, as the market looked more at the jobless rate (a low rate could signal inflation). But then Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's top economist, said the rate might be a statistical fluke, and the market remembered the payroll number and rallied, ending up 13 for the day.

It is reflected in this excerpt from an account he is writing of talks in Cairo that led in May to the accord on Palestinian self-rule for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Mr. Kuttab, a member of the bar in Israel and New York, led the Palestinians' legal committee. After deciding that the Oslo Agreement denied the Palestinians any criminal jurisdiction over Israelis, we had to deal with a section on legal assistance in criminal matters and transfer of suspects.

Among the 21 different styles for which he gives instructions are the Cravate en Cascade (like a waterfall), the Cravate a l'Americaine (requiring a whalebone stiffener) and the Cravate a la Gastronome (""possesses the great advantage of loosening itself in cases of indigestion, apoplexy or fainting""). But even Saint Hilaire, in his enthusiasm, recognized the necktie's nooselike potential: ""It is universally allowed that the least constraint of the body has a corresponding effect on the mind, and it must, therefore, be admitted, that to a certain extent, a tight Cravat will cramp the imagination, and, as it were, suffocate the thoughts.""",1994-06-05T05:00:00+0000

Others persist, terrierlike, until a prize like Bowser's ""Man Writes Dog"" (Westminster Press) is carried in one day and dropped beside one's Morris chair. You are invited to devour the leftovers here presented. Perhaps they do reek a bit of age. Perhaps home videos like ""Rex Takes a Bath"" have supplanted these solemnly formal 19th-century figures and their hygienically disadvantaged 19th-century lives. These seem, indeed, a different breed; in fact, diverse breeds. But mind that somebody once loved each and every one of them.

By using a lot of African fabrics and sculpture, which I love because it has such a modern spirit, we made the living room much bolder. To replace the banquette, we designed a new sofa that's smaller and dips in the center. (It's sexier-looking, and no one sits in the center anyway.) We substituted two straight-backed chairs for the Art Moderne ones. And we now have a huge African ceremonial mask, an art chair by Tom Dixon and an 18th-century Italian console along the wall.

Palestinians and Israelis Joust Over Whose Rule of Law Will Rule","When Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization negotiate details of their peace agreements, what they are really seeking is trust -- practical arrangements that let each side feel secure. For example, Israel prides itself on being a nation guided by law, but that is a hollow claim to many Palestinians who have spent time in Israeli prisons and been subject to abuses denounced by international human-rights groups as amounting to torture. Jonathan Kuttab, a 42-year-old Palestinian lawyer, shares that jaundiced view. It is reflected in this excerpt from an account he is writing of talks in Cairo that led in May to the accord on Palestinian self-rule for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Mr. Kuttab, a member of the bar in Israel and New York, led the Palestinians' legal committee. After deciding that the Oslo Agreement denied the Palestinians any criminal jurisdiction over Israelis, we had to deal with a section on legal assistance in criminal matters and transfer of suspects. Basically the Israelis demanded that Palestinians turn over to them for questioning and trial any Palestinian who carried out criminal activities in Israel itself.",1994-06-05T05:00:00+0000

Pavel Kuka scored twice and midfielder Jan Suchoparek scored a third goal as the Czechs found holes in the Irish defense. Andy Townsend scored a first-half goal for Ireland. The defeat follows three impressive performances, a 1-0 victory in the Netherlands, a 1-0 home triumph over Bolivia and a 2-0 victory in Germany against the defending World Cup champion. The Czechs did not qualify for the World Cup. Ireland opens its World Cup schedule on June 18 against Italy at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP) Sweden Wins Nordic Cup: In Stockholm, striker Tomas Brolin struck twice within six minutes early in the second half as Sweden beat Norway, 2-0, to win the three-nation Nordic Cup tournament. It was the last exhibition before the World Cup finals for Norway, which plays Mexico in its opening game in Washington June 19. (AP) Brazil 1, Canada 1: At Edmonton, Alberta, Canada produced one of its finest soccer results, tying the powerhouse Brazil, 1-1, on a goal by the substitute Eddy Berdusco in the 70th minute of a World Cup tuneup game. Berdusco, who entered in the 62d minute, sent the crowd of 51,930 into a frenzy when he hammered a shot high into the left corner over Brazilian goalie Claudio Taffarel. The goal came after Romario scored in the 45th minute. (AP) AUTO RACING Wallace Outduels Irvan Rusty Wallace, biding his time as Ernie Irvan toyed with the field over the first 400 miles, yesterday won the crash-filled Budweiser 500 Nascar race in Dover, Del. The two engaged in a stirring duel before Wallace held off Irvan at the finish. The margin of victory was about three car lengths (.34 seconds). (AP) GOLF Daniel in a Breeze There was little doubt Beth Daniel would win the L.P.G.A. Oldsmobile in East Lansing, Mich., yesterday. The main question was: How many records would she break on the way? Daniel closed with a four-under 68 yesterday, and her 20-under total tied the L.P.G.A. record for 72 holes set by Nancy Lopez in the 1985 Henredon Classic at the Willow Creek Golf Club in High Point, N.C., also a par-72 course. (AP) Brooks Takes Kemper: Mark Brooks won the Kemper Open with an 18-foot birdie putt on the 18th green yesterday, capping a two-under-par 69 that gave him a three-stroke victory over Bobby Wadkins and D. A. Weibring. But the tournament at Potomac, Md., was essentially decided 12 holes earlier. That was when Wadkins lost his ball -- and a shot at his first victory in his 20 years on the PGA Tour. (AP) (AP) HORSE RACING Market Booster Prevails Market Booster, a 22-1 long shot, got up in the final strides to beat Irish Linnet by a half length in the $100,000-added Sheepshead Bay Handicap at Belmont Park yesterday. Fairy Garden rallied late to finish a length back in third in the field of nine fillies and mares. Market Booster, ridden by Jose Santos, stalked the brisk pace set by Irish Linnet, taking command in late stretch to cover one and three-eighths miles in 2:113/5 over a firm inner turf course. The Wayne Lukas-trained mare, a 5-year-old daughter of Green Dancer, earned her first victory in six starts this year, and $66,690 for owner Moyglare Stud.

Then, for the sake of art, he stood on street corners in a three-piece suit studded with coins and lined with bounced checks. One day he begged; the day after he gave money away. Now Gene Pool (a name he did not inherit) of Brooklyn has created ""Can Man"" -- the mascot of the Recycling Association of Williamsburg. Pool's 35-pound, 500-can costume is held together by 100-pound-test fishing line and stands up to Pool's movements, although cans in high-mangle areas like the knees and seat get replaced more often. As Can Man, Pool performs on stage -- riding a unicycle -- at benefits, school assemblies (he'll remove his headpiece to avoid frightening small children) or any event that requires an arresting metal presence. Frequently he arrives early to lie on the ground for a while, an apparently inert clump of metal, and then spring up with a cacophonous rattle. That way, he says, he's assured of being the center of attention: ""I'm a canned ham.""",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Group A,"Colombia CUP APPEARANCES Two (1962, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (Lost to Cameroon, 2-1, in second round.) BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Romania, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif; United States, June 22 in Pasadena; Switzerland, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Francisco (Pacho) Maturana, a dentist by profession, has transformed Colombia into one of the most entertaining sides in international soccer. A former player of the year in the Colombian domestic league, he coaches America de Cali, the team he guided to the 1992 Colombian title. STYLE One-touch passing, always attacking. TOP PLAYERS Forward Faustino Asprilla, forward Adolfo Valencia, midfielder Carlos Valderrama, midfielder Fredy Rincon, goalie Oscar Cordoba. OUTLOOK A darkhorse candidate to win the World Cup. Colombia thrashed Argentina, 5-0, in Buenos Aires during qualifying. Before losing to Bolivia, 1-0, in an exhibition in mid-April, Colombia had run its string of unbeaten games to 28. Valderrama injured a knee in February, and while his World Cup availability was initially uncertain, he has resumed playing impressively. Much will depend on how his knee holds up, for his passes are the soil from which so many goals flower. Flamboyant goalkeeper Rene Higuita, jailed last summer for accepting $50,000 to help arrange the release of a kidnap victim, was left off the team, but Cordoba has been a solid replacement, even if he doesn't stray from the goal mouth as far and as often as Higuita did. Asprilla is a spectacular player who punctuates his goals with a backflip. He is apparently a much better soccer player than a driver, given his penchant for auto accidents. He once left his car parked in an intersection for two days before retrieving it. Another time, he received nearly three dozen stitches in his leg after reportedly kicking in the window of a bus after a confrontation with the driver. Valencia helped Bayern Munich to Germany's Bundesliga title this season. Romania CUP APPEARANCES Five (1930, 1934, 1938, 1970, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Ireland on penalty kicks in second round) BEST SHOWING Second round in 1990 FIRST ROUND Colombia, June 18 in Pasadena, Calif.; Switzerland, June 22 in Pontiac, Mich.; U.S.A., June 26 in Pasadena. COACH After a 5-2 loss during qualifying to the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks, Cornel Dinu was replaced by Anghel Iordanescu. Iordanescu had been coach of Steaua Bucharest, the army-supported team formerly run by the family of the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. STYLE Latin, combination passing, flair for the spectacular. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, forward Ilie Dumitrescu, forward Florin Raducioiu, defender Gheorghe Popescu, defender Miodrag Belodedici. OUTLOOK Since the fall of Ceausescu, many of Romania's top players have become seasoned in Western European leagues. The fulcrum of the team is the tempestuous Hagi, the ""Maradona of the Carpathians,"" who has a temper to match his scoring ability. He recently served a two-game suspension for spitting at a player from Northern Island during an exhibition. If Hagi maintains his composure, this team could surprise a lot of people, advancing to the quarterfinals or beyond.The Romanians are concerned about their cross-country travel requirements during the eight-day first round. They played the United States twice recently, tying, 1-1, in 1993 and winning, 2-1, earlier this year. Dumitrescu scored all three goals for the Romanians. Iordanescu does not believe that this team possesses the individual talent of the 1990 World Cup team. The coach is especially concerned that Raducioiu, his one true striker, played sparingly this season with AC Milan. Romania can't afford to have a rusty trigger finger; Raducioiu scored seven goals in five World Cup qualifying matches. This team could give the Americans fits on the counterattack. Switzerland CUP APPEARANCES Six (1934, 1938, 1950, 1954, 1962, 1966) LAST CUP 1966 BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals, 1934 and 1938 FIRST ROUND United States, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Romania, June 22 in Pontiac; Colombia, June 26 in Stanford, Calif. COACH Roy Hodgson, a Brit, took over a floundering national team and qualified the Swiss for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 with a victory and a tie against Italy. A charming man, Hodgson took a public relations beating for instituting a teamwide sex ban. Later, he said the celibacy requirement never existed; however wives and girlfriends will stay at a different hotel from the players and will be allowed to visit only after two of the three first-round games. Hodgson said he was less concerned about sex than he was about finding a place that will permit him to light up a cigar in the anti-smoking United States. As a player, Hodgson completed his career in South Africa, then spent more than a decade coaching in Sweden. He then moved to the Swiss club Neuchatel Xamax and in 1992, swapped jobs with Uli Stielike, a German who had become unnerved by the complacency of the national team in defeat. STYLE A 4-4-2 formation that combines individualism of Italian influence with resourcefulness and tight midfield of German approach. TOP PLAYERS Forwards Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup, midfielders Ciraco Sforza, Georges Bregy and Alain Sutter, sweeper Alain Geiger. OUTLOOK None of the Swiss players have World Cup experience, the country's last appearance being 28 years ago. The opener against the Americans, to be played indoors at the Silverdome, in a humid, sticky environment before a pro-U.S.A. crowd, is critical. But Chapuisat and Knup have honed their scoring skills in Germany's Bundesliga. This season Chapuisat scored 16 goals for Borussia Dortmund, and he has a skill that many Americans lack: the ability to finish a play. Knup has scored 21 times in 31 appearances with the national team. Sforza and Bregy are the point guards in midfield, distributing the ball. Goalie Marco Pascolo suffered a knee injury three weeks before the start of the World Cup. At the World Cup draw in December in Las Vegas, Nev., Hodgson said that if his team played a mere 5 percent below its capability, it would not advance beyond the first round. United States CUP APPEARANCES Four (1930, 1934, 1950, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1930 FIRST ROUND Switzerland, June 18 in Pontiac, Mich.; Colombia, June 22 in Pasadena, Calif.; Romania, June 26, in Pasadena COACH Known as the Miracle Worker, Bora Milutinovic coached Mexico to the quarterfinals in 1986 and Costa Rica to the second round in 1990. An eccentric coach, he is famous for his shrewd evasiveness. STYLE Latin, lateral passing, control, possession game. TOP PLAYERS Midfielder Tab Ramos, midfielder Thomas Dooley, midfielder John Harkes, forward Ernie Stewart, forward Eric Wynalda, striker Roy Wegerle, goalkeeper Tony Meola. OUTLOOK If the foreign-based players can be assimilated in time, the United States can avoid becoming the first host country not to advance to the second round. Much depends on the first game against Switzerland. At least the Silverdome audience will be supportive, which may not be the case against Colombia and Romania at the Rose Bowl. A 1-0 victory over Mexico in the final exhibition was a confidence booster, especially since the crowd of 91,123 -- the largest ever to see the United States team play in this country -- was overwhelmingly pro-Mexico. But there are still kinks to be worked out. The United States built a modest 2-2-7 exhibition record against World Cup finalists, struggling to score goals and lapsing frequently on defense. The defense appeared much more cohesive against Mexico with Dooley playing at sweeper in place of Marcelo Balboa, who has not been the same since undergoing knee surgery in April 1993. Milutinovic has plenty of decisions to make: Start Stewart at striker, or opt for Frank Klopas, who has scored seven goals in his last nine games? Start Wynalda, or let him continue to kick-start the attack off the bench? Milutinovic must also find a place for John Harkes, who did not arrive until early June from the English League.",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

FIRST ROUND Russia, June 20 in Stanford, Calif.; Cameroon, June 24 in Stanford; Sweden, June 28 in Pontiac, Mich. COACH Carlos Alberto Parreira, a 51-year-old Brazilian. He never played at the World Cup level, and this is his second tenure as coach. He was the team psychotherapist when Brazil won the World Cup in 1970. Parreira has also coached Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. STYLE Freewheeling and improvising from defense to midfield to attack. Attractive to watch once it gets into a rhythm. TOP PLAYERS Romario, a prolific scorer -- and legendary loudmouth -- who plays in Barcelona; Rai, a midfielder, who plays for Paris St. Germain in France, and Bebeto, a forward, who plays for Deportivo La Coruna in Spain. A reserve forward is Ronaldo, a 17-year-old sensation who works the ball equally well with his left and right foot and who scored 54 goals in Cruzeiro's first 54 games. The front-line duo of Romario and Bebeto symbolizes what Bebeto thinks is Brazil's edge over its opponents. ""Creativity,"" he said. ""We are a group of players capable of deciding a game in an individual play. And the coach will give us that freedom during the cup."" The lightning-footed Romario is known for his outspokenness, and his refusal to accept sitting on the bench led to his suspension from the national team last year. Bebeto, a shy, frequently injured homebody, has great ball control around the penalty area and is known for his dangerous free kicks. OUTLOOK One of the favorites in the tournament despite being under pressure for failing since 1970, the year it won the tournament with what is considered the best team in the history of the World Cup. This team has no Pele or Rivelino or Zico or Gerson, but it has a plethora of talented players from defense to attack. They are good enough to restore Brazil's traditional attacking skills. Look for the squad to be one of the most entertaining and colorful teams. Cameroon CUP APPEARANCES Two (1982, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to England, 3-2, in quarterfinals) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1990. FIRST ROUND Sweden, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Brazil, June 24 in Stanford, Calif., and Russia, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Henri Michel, a likable Frenchman, in January became the fifth man to coach Cameroon since its heartwarming performance in Italy in 1990. Michel is no stranger to the Rose Bowl, where Cameroon will open against Sweden. It was there that the French team coached by Michel won the gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. Later, as coach of the national team, he led France to a third-place finish in the 1986 World Cup. STYLE They used a 4-4-2 four years ago and throughout qualifying, but Michel is leaning toward a 4-3-3 here. The system suits his open demeanor and the Indomitable Lions' surplus of talented strikers. Michel will probably let Francois Omam-Biyick, no longer a true center-forward, operate behind the front three. TOP PLAYERS Cameroon's best player is probably its angular forward Omam-Biyick, who has scored many important goals in nine years with the Lions. Their best-known player is Roger Milla, the 42-year-old striker who came out of retirement four years ago and scored four goals to lead Cameroon into the quarterfinals. Against the wishes of Michel and Omam-Biyick (but with the full support of the Cameroonian public), Milla has come out of retirement again. It remains to be seen whether Michel will play him, particularly since the Lions have no shortage of faster running mates for Omam-Biyik, including the explosive 23-year-old forward Alphonse Tchami. OUTLOOK Political infighting, poor management and financial difficulties turned the team's preparation into a farce. Michel got punched in the face by Jean-Claude Pagal after he learned he was not chosen for the team. With an unsettled mix of aging stars and inexperienced youngsters, and with a nasty group that includes Brazil, Sweden and Russia, the Indomitable Lions look incapable of making the second round. Russia CUP APPEARANCES Seven as the Soviet Union (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990). LAST CUP 1990 (1-2). BEST SHOWING Semifinals in 1966 FIRST ROUND Brazil, June 20 in Stanford, Calif.; Sweden, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Cameroon, June 28 in Stanford. COACH Pavel Sadyrin, a 51-year-old Russian who took over the team after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, was successful player and coach at the club level. But late last year, 14 of his players called him ""incompetent"" and refused to play in the World Cup if he remained coach. The Russian federation backed Sadyrin and gave the players an ultimatum. The mutiny was not the first by a team coached by Sadyrin: he was dismissed at Zenit Leningrad after a player rebellion there in spite of winning a league title. STYLE Orthodox European style. They take a direct route from defense to attack primarily through the flanks with minimal lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Sergei Yuran, a 24-year-old forward with Benfica of Portugal, is one of the finest prospects in the world and has scored seven internaional goals. Dmitry Kharine, a goalkeeper who plays for Chelsea in England was in goal for the gold-medal winning Soviet team in 1988. Dmitry Radchenko, a forward, who plays for Racing in Spain. OUTLOOK This is country that has gone through perhaps more team adversity than any other in the tournament. It would be difficult to restore harmony after the coach went as far as calling the rebelling players traitors. Sadyrin doesn't have the service of four key players: winger Andrei Kanchelskis of Manchester United, forward Sergei Kiryakov of Karlsruhe in Germany, forward Igor Kolyvanov of Foggia in Italy and forward Igor Shalimov of Internazionale of Milan in Italy. This is a team that still has good individual players, but they lack cohesion, preparation because of the revolt and are in a difficult group. Don't look for them to get past the first round. Sweden CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1938, 1950, 1958, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Runner-up to Brazil in 1958 FIRST ROUND Cameroon, June 19 in Pasadena, Calif.; Russia, June 24 in Pontiac, Mich., and Brazil, June 28 in Pontiac. COACH Tommy Svensson, a 49-year-old Swede, who played for the national team 39 times, including the World Cup tournament in Mexico in 1970. He had coached four Swedish clubs and was coaching in Norway when he was asked to restore Swedish honor after the team finished 21st in Italy in 1990. STYLE Closer to the so-called English School that calls for long passes down the flank and crosses into the middle of the attack. TOP PLAYERS Tomas Brolin, who plays for Parma in the Italian League, has had a stormy relationship with the Swedish team and news media, and actually told Svensson he didn't want to play for his country. But he came back and scored three goals in the 5-0 victory in the qualifying game against Israel. Martin Dahlin, a forward with Borussia Monchengladbach of Germany, was Sweden's leading scorer during qualifying, with eight goals in the nine games. Another key player is Tomas Ravelli of Gothenburg, the 34-year-old goalkeeper. Klas Ingesson, a midfielder, injured his neck in a car crash earlier this month but is expected to be all right by the time the tournament starts. OUTLOOK Another team hampered by the fact that most players compete for clubs outside the country and don't play enough together. Lack of cohesiveness may be evident as a result. The presence of Brolin and Dahlin makes the Swedes dangerous offensively, and advancement past the first round is not farfetched.",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Group D,"Argentina CUP APPEARANCES 10 (1930, 1934, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990). LAST CUP 1990 finalist (lost to Germany, 1-0) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1978 and 1986 FIRST ROUND Greece, June 21 in Foxboro, Mass.; Nigeria, June 25 in Foxboro; Bulgaria, June 30 in Dallas. COACH Alfio Basile, a 50-year-old Argentine nicknamed Coco. Unlike a great number of Argentines past and present, he has done all his playing and coaching in his native country. He coached his first game for the national team on Feb. 19, 1992. STYLE Typically Latin, with short passes and plenty of lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Diego Maradona, the man without a team, who is gradually getting into the shape necessary to meet the rigors of the tournament. Gabriel Batistuta, a striker who plays for Fiorentina, has the potential to be a high scorer in the tournament. Diego Simeone, a midfielder who plays fo Seville in Spain. Claudio Caniggia, who is returning after a year's ban for drug abuse, can also be a key to the attack. OUTLOOK The strength of Diego Maradona's legs will decide how far the team goes beyond the first round. No one argues with Basile that Argentina is in a fairly easy group in the opening round and its advancement is virtually assured. Unfavorable results in warmup matches should not be taken seriously. Playing two first-round games in the Boston area, where the temperature is not expected to be as hot, is also to Argentina's advantage besides the relatively weak opponents. Bulgaria CUP APPEARANCES Five (1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986) LAST CUP 1986 BEST SHOWING Second round in 1986 FIRST ROUND Nigeria, June 21 in Dallas; Greece, June 26 in Chicago, and Argentina, June 30 in Dallas. COACH Dimitar Penev, a 48-year-old Bulgarian. He played 90 times for the national team, including in three World Cup tournaments, in 1966, 1970 and 1974. He took over as coach of the national team in the summer of 1990 and went without a defeat in his first six games. He is a man of few rounds and a master of tactics, as he proved in the elimination of France in the qualifying round. STYLE With most players competing for clubs in different countries, there is no concrete style. TOP PLAYERS Hristo Stoichkov, a forward with Barcelona and a fixture in the Spanish League for years, is the heart and soul of the team. Others to watch include Krasimir Balakov, a midfielder and the leading scorer for Sporting Lisbon, and Emil Kostadinov, a forward with Porto of Portugal who scored both goals on the final day of qualifying. Yordan Lechkov is Hamburg's rising star and the Bulgarians' key playmaker. Of the three goalkeepers, Borislav Mikhailov is considered the strongest. He had five shutouts in qualifying. The defensive unit is led by players from the home champion Levski Sofia -- Tsanko Tsvetanov, Emil Kremenliev, Zlatko Yankov and Petar Hubchev, who was sold recently by Levski to Hamburg SV. OUTLOOK They have trouble handling a skillful team that plays with speed. With Argentina and Nigeria, they have two of those types of teams in their group. What they have on their side is some experienced players and a coach who can make the right tactical move to win a game. A victory over Greece in their second game is a must if they are to advance. Greece CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Argentina, June 21 in Foxboro, Mass.; Bulgaria, June 26 in Chicago; Nigeria, June 30 in Foxboro COACH Alketas (Alkis) Panagoulias, a 60-year-old Greek and a naturalized American citizen who has lived in the United States for 25 years. He originally came to the United States in 1962 to study for degrees in international relations and United Nations relations at the New York School for Social Studies. An accomplished player with Aris of Salonica, he is in his second stint as coach of the Greeks. He was the coach of the United States from 1983 to 1985. STYLE Direct up and down with little lateral movement and plenty of reliance on counterattacks. TOP PLAYERS Stelios Manolas, who is the captain of AEK in Athens, where he has played for 14 seasons, is the key to the defense. Tasos Mitropoulos of AEK, who at 36 is the Greeks' oldest player, is national team captain and the playmaker in midfield. He scored the tying goal, a header, against Russia in Moscow to give Greece its first-ever World Cup bid. Dimitris Saravakos of Panathinaikos is the most well-known forward. OUTLOOK Greece is the only nation in the tournament without a player competing for a club outside the country. The team has had some poor results in warm-up matches. Although Greece has the oldest team in the tournament in average age, lack of World Cup experience and mental toughness for the rigors of such a tournament is not on its side. What it does have on its side is strong fan support from the large Greek community and the fact the Greeks trained in the United States longer than any other team except Saudi Arabia. Nigeria CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Bulgaria, June 21 in Dallas; Argentina, June 25 in Foxboro, Mass.; Greece, June 30 in Foxboro COACH In five years with the Super Eagles, Clemens Westerhof of the Netherlands has never lost an international match at home, and his coaching and organizational skills have unquestionably been a major factor in the team's rise. STYLE With their athleticism, strength and attacking bent, the Nigerians should be one of the most entertaining teams in the tournament. Their base 4-4-2 often becomes a 4-2-4 with four forwards: usually Emmanuel Amunike or Samson Siasia on the left wing, Rashidi Yekini and Daniel Amokachi in the center and George Finidi on the right wing. This works, in part, because Sunday Oliseh and others further back are capable of covering a lot of ground. The Super Eagles under Westerhof now rely less on the long ball and more on the short passing game, well-orchestrated by the playmaker Okocha. TOP PLAYERS Yekini is Nigeria's and Africa's star, a muscular striker with speed and power who has been the leading scorer in three different countries: Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Portugal. On defense, Westerhof has captain Stephen Keshi, Benedict Iroha and an imposing, experienced goalkeeper in Peter Rufai, who has competition in Wilfred Agbonavbare. OUTLOOK Westerhof says his team ""will be the surprise of the World Cup,"" but the truth is that Nigeria will not surprise any soccer buff by succeeding. The Eagles lost only one match in qualifying and have remarkable depth. The only question is defense, where the Nigerians suffered occasional lapses during the African Nation's Cup. If the Nigerians can play defense worthy of their offense, the quarterfinals just might not be the limit.",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Group E","IrelandCUP APPEARANCES One (1990)LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Italy, 1-0, in quarterfinals)BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1990FIRST ROUND Italy, June 18 in East Rutherford, N.J.; Mexico, June 24 in Orlando, Fla., and Norway, June 28 in East Rutherford.COACH The Irish had had scant international success until Jack Charlton -- called the most popular Englishman in Ireland -- took charge in 1986. He promptly led them to qualification for the European Nations Cup of 1988 and the 1990 World Cup, where the Irish made the quarterfinals without winning a game (four ties) and despite scoring only two goals. In 1966, Charlton was a center-back for England's World Cup winning team, with his more famous brother, Bobby.STYLE Hustle, hustle and more hustle. Ireland plays no fancy soccer -- the green-shirted guys harass the opponents, rag the ball and, when they win it, clobber long passes down the wings, then cross it into the middle, hoping an Irishman will head it in before someone else heads it out. Midfielders tend to think defense first, so Ireland's own half of the field is often packed when the opposition tries to penetrate.TOP PLAYERS About half of Ireland's squad is older than 30, including several key men: the goalkeeper, Packie Bonner (34); the team's best defender, Paul McGrath (34); midfielder Ray Houghton (32), and forwards Tony Cascarino (31) and John Aldridge (35). Bonner is Ireland's most-capped player, with 73 appearances for his nation since 1981. He's reliable, but has had trouble playing the ball out of danger with his feet (instead of scooping it up) as required under the new rule on back-passes from teammates. The versatile McGrath can play midfield or defense but will probably stay back, leaving leadership of Charlton's defense-minded midfield to Roy Keane, a 22-year-old who stars for Manchester United in the English top league, Houghton and Andy Townsend.OUTLOOK With 3 points for a first-round victory and 1 for a tie, the Irish will be out of luck if they play as they did in 1990. In such a tough group, with Italy and Mexico capable of scoring a few goals, and with heat and humidity taking a toll on older players, Ireland must make its defensive style produce victories this time.ItalyCUP APPEARANCES 12, or every tournament except 1958LAST CUP 1990 (lost to Argentina on penalty kicks in the semifinals)BEST SHOWING Champions in 1934, 1938 and 1982",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Group C,"Bolivia CUP APPEARANCES Two (1930, 1950) LAST CUP 1950 BEST SHOWING First round in 1930 and 1950 FIRST ROUND Germany, June 17 in Chicago; South Korea, June 23 in Foxboro, Mass., and Spain, June 27 in Chicago. COACH From his bushy mustache to his diverse resume, Xabier Azkargorta stands apart from the rest of the World Cup coaching fraternity. A specialist in traumatic medicine, Azkargorta, a 40-year-old Basque, left his practice at the end of 1992 to take over the Bolivian team. The result was spectacular as the Bolivians qualified for the finals on their own for the first time in history. STYLE They often use a 5-4-1 (five defenders, four midfielders and one striker), but that does not mean they are defensive-minded. Their midfielders and outside defenders are very quick to counterattack, which helps explain how the team scored more goals (22) than any other in South America during qualifying. TOP PLAYERS Bolivia's strength is its midfield, which would have been considerably stronger if its star, 24-year-old Marco Etcheverry, weren't hampered by a knee injury. The Bolivians will be forced to rely more heavily on attacking midfielder Erwin (Platini) Sanchez of the Portuguese club Boavista. Sanchez, like his French namesake, is a remarkable passer and has a gift for free kicks. Julio Cesar Baldivieso, another midfielder, also bears watching, as does striker William Ramallo, who led the continent in scoring during qualifying with seven goals. OUTLOOK The bad news for the Bolivians is that Denver is not a World Cup site. They perform best in high altitude and won all four of their matches at home in La Paz, which lies at about 13,000 feet. But hyperventilating opponents do not explain all of Bolivia's success. The real explanation lies in a new generation of players and the inspirational influence of Azkargorta. The presence of Spain in the same group and uncertainty over Etcheverry mean the Bolivians are unlikely to see the second round. Germany CUP APPEARANCES 12 (1934, 1938, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990. East Germany in 1974) LAST CUP Champion in 1990 (beat Argentina, 1-0) BEST SHOWING Champion in 1954, 1974 and 1990 FIRST ROUND Bolivia, June 17 in Chicago; Spain, June 21 in Chicago, and South Korea, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Hubert (Berti) Vogts played in three World Cup finals (1970, 1974, 1978) for the national team and was named German player of the year in 1975 and 1979. He has spent his entire coaching career with the German Football Federation, working with juniors and as an assistant coach before replacing Franz Beckenbauer in 1990. STYLE Precise, relentless and remarkably cohesive. Lothar Matthaus should prove a more versatile sweeper than Thomas Berthold, who started against Argentina four years ago. The continuing brilliance of Thomas Hassler and the rise of Stefan Effenberg, Matthias Sammer and Andreas Moller guarantee that the Germans will remain aggressive in midfield. TOP PLAYERS At 33, Mat thaus is no longer the dominant creative force of 1990, but the captain remains a cut above his peers as he prepares for his fourth cup appearance. Nine of the 11 players who started in the 1990 final are back, including Bodo Illgner, Jurgen Klinsmann, Rudi Voller, Hassler and Andreas Brehme. The best of the new crop: Effenberg, Sammer and Moller. OUTLOOK Germany has played more matches (68) in the cup finals than any other nation; there's no reason to believe it won't get to play 7 more this year. Beckenbauer's inspirational qualities will be missed, but the Germans are poised and talented enough to inspire themselves. South Korea CUP APPEARANCES Three (1954, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (0-3) BEST SHOWING Never past the first round FIRST ROUND Spain, June 17 in Dallas; Bolivia, June 23 in Foxboro, Mass.; Germany, June 27 in Dallas. COACH Despite seven years as a defender with the South Korean national team, Kim Ho never made it to the World Cup finals as a player. Ho, 49, started his coaching career in 1979 as an assistant with the national under-19 team, where he helped develop many of the players on South Korea's 1986 and 1990 cup teams. He became coach of the national team in September 1992. STYLE South Korea is a dangerous counterattacking team that, against Asian competition, likes to penetrate up the wings, particularly the right side where Noh Jung Yoon is faster and more powerful than most who mark him. TOP PLAYERS The attacking midfielder Kim Joo Sung, the only South Korean playing in Europe, has the biggest reputation. A former Asian player of the year, he started for South Korea in the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals and adopted the nickname Sampson because of his long hair that he said gave him strength and courage. But he was overshadowed during qualifying by another attacking midfielder, Noh Jung Yoon, a compact and swift technician who usually operates on the right wing. The South Koreans also may have the best goalkeeper in Asia in Choi In Young and a midfielder who was sensational in Qatar in Shin Hong Gi. OUTLOOK The first Asian team to play in four World Cup finals does not have an illustrious past from which to draw confidence. In eight previous matches against the globe's best, the South Koreans have managed only one tie and have been outscored, 29-5. Ho's goal is the second round, and such ambition is admirable. Spain CUP APPEARANCES Eight (1934, 1950, 1962, 1966, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990) LAST CUP 1990 (Lost to Yugoslavia, 2-1 in second round) BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1934 and 1986 FIRST ROUND South Korea, June 17 in Dallas; Germany, June 21 in Chicago, and Bolivia, June 27 in Chicago. COACH Outspoken and combative, Javier Clemente has been directing the national team for less than two years and has reshaped it profoundly, phasing out such high-profile World Cup veterans as Michel and Emilio Butragueno and opting for youth and solidarity in the form of nine players from Spain's best club, FC Barcelona.",1994-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Peter Max Tries Soccer","WHAT: The commemorative poster for the 1994 World Cup, soccer's quadrennial get-together, to be held for the first time in the United States from Friday through July 17 in nine cities across the countryWHO: This year, Peter Max, the New York pop artist of 60's psychedelic fame (you remember, ""Yellow Submarine""), was commissioned to create the tournament's lasting legacy. In the past, the likes of Joan Miro, Antoni Tapies, Alberto Burri and Annie Leibovitz have done World Cup postersWHY PETER MAX? ""We wanted an American artist, but one who was internationally known,"" said Jeff Bliss, the senior vice president for marketing for World Cup '94. ""A popular artist who would appeal to more than a specific niche."" From a dozen possibilities, it came down to Mr. Max, who proved to be ""the best fit,"" Mr. Bliss said. And Mr. Max is a global guy -- born in Germany in 1937 and raised in China, Israel, France and then Brooklyn. He's also an old hand when it comes to posters: this year alone he was commissioned to create posters for Super Bowl XXVIII, the Grammy Awards and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage FestivalTHE MAX SPIN: Mr. Max has always had a predilection for the celestial -- he has even given his children the nicknames Astro and Cosmo -- so it's not surprising that he has put a spacey spin on this design. It shows a soccer player suspended in the stratosphere, hovering over the United States, whose shape has been filled in with the stars and stripes (two stars, six stripes).

Thus, when 114 of the Roman Catholic Church's 139 cardinals rallied last week to defend Pope John Paul II's opposition to proposals to be considered at a United Nations conference on population this year, the event had all the hallmarks of orchestration. The cardinals, who had been called to Rome to discuss preparations for Christianity's next millennium, endorsed an appeal by John Cardinal O'Connor of New York for the Cairo conference -- regarded by the Clinton Administration, American feminists and population experts as a pivotal opportunity to enhance the status of women -- to avoid ""cultural imperialism"" that would lead to abortion on demand, sexual promiscuity and distortions of traditional family values. Coming only weeks after the Pope himself used stern language to repudiate any talk of women in the priesthood, the cardinals' action seemed to offer one more confirmation that the Vatican is crusading against what it sees as a pervasive feminist challenge.

The board limited the term of the lease to a year. At the time of the sublet the co-op's bylaws allowed a unit to be sublet for up to four years before the shareholder had to move back in or sell it. When the tenant rented my unit it was with the understanding that the four-year clause was in effect even though the lease was for only one year. The intent on both our parts was to sign a new lease for each of the four years. This year, part way into the second one-year lease, the co-op board changed the sublet period to a maximum of two years, after which I must either move back in or sell. Do I have the legal right to sublet my apartment in years three and four, either by grandfathering in the four-year sublet clause, which was in place at the time the lease was first signed, or by any other means? . . .

Dada Dearest","""One cannot understand Dada; one must experience it. Dada is immediate and obvious. If you're alive, you are a Dadaist."" So declared the poet Richard Huelsenbeck in his introduction to THE DADA ALMANAC (Atlas/Serpent's Tail, paper, $19.99), a collection of manifestoes, poems, photographs and other documents collected on the occasion of the First International Dada Fair, held in Berlin in 1920. The almanac assembled contributions from leading exponents of Dada, an international cultural movement centered in Berlin with satellites in Zurich, Paris, Cologne, Barcelona and New York, among other cities. Contributors included Hugo Ball (who with his wife, the singer Emmy Hennings, launched Dada in Zurich in 1916 by opening the Cabaret Voltaire), the Romanian poet and Dada propagandist Tristan Tzara, the artists Francis Picabia and Hans Arp, and the architect, performance artist and agent provocateur Johannes Baader, among many others. Not represented in the almanac was the more politically active contingent of Berlin Dada, including George Grosz, John Heartfield and Wieland Herzfelde, an omission that points to the fractures in the ever-volatile movement that was born of the disgust of European artists and intellectuals with the carnage produced by the nationalist fever of World War I. This annotated edition of the almanac, the first to appear in English, includes an introduction in the form of a survey of the history of Dada by the editor and translator Malcolm Green, capsule biographies of Dada figures, and supplementary documents and photographs. This is a somewhat rough and ready edition with an agitprop quality, but it is nevertheless a crucial document for anyone interested in the history of the 20th-century avant-garde.MIGNON NIXON",1994-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Needing to cut back but unable to fire workers, companies are hiring less. 39 A Mexican official said politics is preventing a fair election. 6 Ransom will be paid for a kidnapped Mexican businessman. 6 Belarus voters signaled their dissatisfaction with current leaders. 3 Buenos Aires Journal: Facing up to a murky past. 4 National 8-12 COMPROMISE ON HEALTH Seven Senate Finance Committee members endorsed a compromise that would try to make health insurance more affordable through regulation but would not require anyone to buy coverage. 1 How the proposed compromise might work. 9 PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS The Supreme Court placed new limits on the ability of governments to require developers to set aside part of their property for environmental or other public uses. 1 CALLING FOR REVIEW Juries cannot have the last word on punitive damages, the Supreme Court ruled, saying that states must make some form of judicial review available. 11 A PRESIDENT'S FRUSTRATIONS President Clinton unleashed an unusually bitter attack on the press, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, conservative radio talk show hosts in general and Rush Limbaugh in particular. 1 GRAND JURY INQUIRY HALTED In a highly unusual step, a judge stopped a grand jury that was deciding whether to indict O. J. Simpson, saying pretrial publicity could prejudice their deliberations. 1 EXPLAINING TIME'S COVER The managing editor of Time magazine said no ""racial implication"" had been intended by a cover photo illustration in which O. J. Simpson's face was darkened. 8 REMEMBERING THE DEAD The Emperor of Japan laid a wreath in an oblique gesture to the servicemen killed the day Japanese warplanes attacked Pearl Harbor. 8 TWO TRIALS, ONE CONVICTION Four Miami police officers were convicted of misleading investigators in an effort to cover up a drug dealer's beating death. An earlier acquittal was followed by a riot. 8 TOBACCO LOBBYISTS' WORK Soon after President Clinton outlined a health plan calling for a sharp increase in tobacco taxes, industry lobbyists went into action.

By Friday, the White House decided to intervene and got 16 central banks to join it in a $5-billion shopping trip for dollars, but traders didn't even blink, as the dollar hit a '94 low of 1.58 marks. The next step, of course, could well be for the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws again in early July, and this prospect didn't make the stock market happy at all, as the Dow industrials plunged 62 points on Friday, ending a dismal week in which it lost 140 points, or close to 4 percent.

A Classic Returns, Bringing a Smile","WHAT: A canvas athletic shoe made by Converse Inc., that bears the signature of the late sportsman Jack Purcell. This classic shoe with the bulbous rubber toe and minimalist look has recently won over hipsters, making the shoe seem ubiquitous.RECENT SIGHTINGS: In the Donna Karan men's Spring '94 collection; on Christy Turlington in an advertisement for Burberrys; on Claudia Schiffer in a spread in Vogue in January; in music videos (anything by Nirvana), and in unpaid celebrity endorsements, as when Billy Crystal wore a pair on the ""Tonight"" show on June 9. ""These things go in cycles,"" said Burt Holland, a shoe buyer at Paragon Sporting Goods. ""Last summer, the hot shoe was the Adidas Superstar; this year it's the Jack Purcell. Sales are up about 20 percent over last year.""HISTORIC SIGHTINGS: James Dean wore Jack Purcells on the set of ""Giant."" Kurt Cobain favored black Jack Purcells. Before being displaced in the 60's, Jack Purcells were the only shoes worn by members of the United States Davis Cup Team.ORIGINS: Although considered by many to be a quintessential American product, the shoe was actually introduced, in 1933, by the Canadian branch of B. F. Goodrich. Two years later, the company put it on the United States market. In 1972, Converse bought the B. F. Goodrich rubber division and acquired the Jack Purcell trademark.JACK BE NIMBLE: Mr. Purcell, also Canadian, was one of his country's leading tennis players in the 1930's and the world badminton champion from 1932 to 1945. But he was not just the shoe's namesake. Although another famous athlete, the basketball player Chuck Taylor, had lent his name to the Converse All Star as early as 1923, Mr. Purcell was the first athlete to play an integral role in designing a shoe.THE TOES HAVE IT: Designed for racquet sports, the Jack Purcell became popular among serious athletes because of increased performance and comfort. Key elements that set it apart were a layered rubber toe that extended across the top of the shoe (providing better protection and traction, especially when toe drag came into play); a durable, baby-blue rubber sole, and a blue stripe across the shoe's tip that has become known as the ""smile.""BLUE SMILE MANIA: ""In the 30's and 40's, the Purcell was the shoe,"" said Jack Kramer, the American tennis legend. ""The first time I tried on a pair was in 1935. I went to a junior tournament in San Bernardino, and everyone was wearing Purcells. That night I told my father that I needed to have the shoe with the funny blue mark on the toe. None of us kids knew who Jack Purcell was, but that didn't matter, it was a great shoe. I wore them for the next five years. In fact, the only reason I stopped wearing them was because I signed up with Wilson, who offered to give me free shoes.""COLOR MANIA: Although the classic Jack Purcell comes in white (adult sizes 3-12, $36 retail), the shoe is also available in black, navy, maroon, pine, deep grape, chestnut and ""torpedo gray."" A suede model in either ""pilot blue"" or terra cotta is to be unveiled next spring.ME MANIA: The stylist Brana Wolf has used Jack Purcells in several high-profile fashion shoots, giving the shoe considerable exposure. Asked her take on the shoe's recent popularity, she said: ""I guess they have become hip all of a sudden. Gee . . . did I do this?""RENE CHUN",1994-06-26T05:00:00+0000

That is only the most startling of the attacks being directed at Bill and Hillary Clinton by fundamentalist Christian leaders. 1 President Kennedy was sued in 1962 for actions before taking office. 12 INCESSANT ATTRACTION They were divorced, but they continued to date each other. O. J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson vacationed together in Mexico with their children. But celebrity hid the dynamics of their relationship. 1 SOME PROGRESS, LESS GAIN Congress is meeting a critical deadline on national health insurance legislation, but it is making progress without really coming closer to gether. 1 VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES Two large states with the same southern neighbor, Mexico, show very different attitudes about illegal immigration. California is ready to call out the National Guard, but Texas is taking a much more relaxed attitude. 12 UNEXPECTED OUTCOME A study finds that the blood vessel tissue of blacks is less flexible and expandable than those of whites, which could explain why blacks are more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease. 15 NOMINATION WITHDRAWN The Defense Department has withdrawn its choice for commander of American forces in the Pacific because misgivings about his handling of sexual harassment issues threatened to hold up Senate confirmation at a time of increasing tensions in the Korean Peninsula. 17 BISHOPS SPEAK ON SEXUALITY Episcopal bishops affirm in a draft pastoral teaching on human sexuality that marriage remains the foundation of the church's sexual guidance. But the document calls homosexuality an orientation of ""a significant minority of persons."" 19 Metro 23-29 MINORITY CONTRACTING PROBLEMS In a three-month investigation of an affirmative-action program to award New York City contracts to companies owned by women or minorities, The New York Times found that questionable companies and faulty record-keeping inflated the value of the program, making it appear much more successful than it actually was. 1 AIDS TESTING FOR MOTHERS New York State's seven-year-old policy of testing all newborns for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but then refusing to inform parents of the results is under attack in the State Assembly. 23 STANGL'S LOST BATTLE Every M.T.A. chairman has to learn how to tame the tiger of politics. But Peter E. Stangl is discovering who actually cracks the whip, and he's running for re-election this year. 23 CRACKING THE CASE New police units concentrate on solving drug-related murders by scooping up drug dealers in buy-and-bust operations and coaxing them to tell about crimes they have seen or heard. 25 TAKE ME OUT TO THE SOCCER GAME For generations Kearny, N.J., a former mill town by the Passaic River, has seen its young men go off to do battle on fields in foreign lands. All of them were soccer players. 28 AND A STAR TO STEER HER BY For students at North Shore High School on Long Island, building a 23-foot sailboat was the senior project to end all senior projects, a four-year lesson in history and design and patience. 28 The fourth Gay Games drew to an ebullient close yesterday. 25 Obituaries 40 Marv Throneberry, former major league baseball player.

us,The Face of AIDS,"In their striking collections of photographs of men, women and children affected by AIDS, Carolyn Jones and Sal Lopes capture, with compassion and dignity, the faith, optimism and grief prompted by illness. The images are moving and at times anguished, but the faces depicted in both books convey hope and fortitude far more than sadness. For LIVING PROOF: Courage in the Face of AIDS (Abbeville, $19.95), Ms. Jones, a New York fashion photographer, asked people who are H.I.V. positive to pose in her studio with an object or person that meant a great deal to them. The symbolism speaks for itself -- a close-up of two hands entwined, a mother embracing her daughter, a young man straightening his tie to prepare for whatever comes next. Her subjects' comments focus less on the pain of loss than on the determination, verve and spirit of renewal that they need to live. Almost without exception, their goal is to enjoy the life that remains, and the ultimate effect of these powerful portraits is surprisingly upbeat. In LIVING WITH AIDS: A Photographic Journal (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $24.95), Mr. Lopes chronicles three related stories. First, he illustrates the emotional -- and political -- impact of AIDS by depicting the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt as it was unfurled during demonstrations in Washington in 1988 and 1992. Candid shots show mourners touching, lying sprawled across and even wrapped around sections of the quilt. In the next section, Mr. Lopes, the author of ""The Wall: Images and Offerings From the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,"" records the bonds that develop between AIDS patients and the volunteers assigned, through a community ""buddies"" program, to help them through their illness. The agonizing immediacy of these dual portraits -- in many cases the AIDS patients are visibly close to death -- carries a message of courage and mutual support. The final section tells the story of John and Sharon Boyce and their daughter Brianna, adopted when she was 3 years old and already suffering from AIDS. Brianna is heart-wrenchingly lovely, even in her frailty; in a postscript we learn she died last June, at the age of 7. DIANE COLE",1994-06-26T05:00:00+0000
