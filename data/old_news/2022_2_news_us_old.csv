The organization had offices and food distribution centers in Manhattan and Queens, but the move has enabled it to consolidate all its operations in one location, which City Harvest says is the largest food rescue and distribution hub in the nation.

More than 250 million of those pounds have been just since the start of the pandemic.

(Full disclosure: I wrote City Harvest: 100 Recipes from Great New York Restaurants, published in 2015 as a fund-raiser for the group.) The new building, designed by Ennead Architects, the Rockwell Group and Ware Malcomb, has refrigerated and ambient areas for food collection, loading docks, and by summer will also have an event space with a roof terrace that can be rented.

Now,  this restaurant in the Hotel Chelsea on West 23rd Street, one of the citys oldies  it first opened in 1930  will open its doors again this week. (It closed in 2018 when the hotels renovations began.) The hotel will also reopen this month, but the restaurant is ready now, its size reduced from the original 220 seats to around 65. Sunday Hospitality, the owners of Sunday in Brooklyn, is running it with Charles Seich, a new partner here, and the companys culinary director and partner, Jaime Young, is in charge of the food. At his side is the chef de cuisine Byron Hogan, who cooked in Spain for the past 12 years, mostly in Madrid, and moved to the United States to work here. We want to make it authentic, looking more to the north of Spain with the Basque Country and Galicia, Mr. Young said. Without straying far from the traditional, the chefs have come up with a dish that combines boquerones and oil-cured anchovies, a combination of preserved tuna with leeks and tomato, and squid with morcilla sausage. The paella for which the restaurant has long been known is now made mostly with seafood and also rabbit. The portions are not as massive as in the old days, but that era is evoked by pitchers with red and white sangrias. Spain dominates the wine list, and there are sherries, gins, vermouths and ciders. Burgundy leather, wrought iron, dark wood and a recently uncovered tile floor define the space, with a bar, a few tables and intimate booths. Later this year, Sunday Hospitality will open a French American bistro in the hotel. (Opens Wednesday) ",2022-02-08T16:52:16+0000

In September, the Sackler family, which was behind the OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma and helped create this overdose epidemic, finally agreed to disband the company and to pay a settlement of $4.5 billion. That may sound like a whopping amount of money, but as the journalist Patrick Radden Keefe points out, its arguably not. He profiled the Sacklers rise in his book Empire of Pain and points out: Theyre paying it out over nine years; they have an $11 billion fortune. They can just pay it with the returns. Plus, as part of the settlement, the Sacklers were granted sweeping immunity from opioid-related lawsuits.

Purdue Pharma is appealing.)",2022-02-14T10:00:08+0000

Justin and I have been wanting to do something together for years, Mr. McDonald said. Glossy black walls are the backdrop for vibrant colors. Mr. Bazdarichs Mexican-inspired menu with a seafood focus explores the Pacific Coast from California, with a farmers market escabeche and a Caesar salad, on down through Mexico. Also on the menu are smoked shrimp chicharrn, fresh tuna slathered with salsa macha, tostada mixto piled high with marinated seafood, branzino with a masa crust in a red sauce, and octopus with fried potatoes and romesco sauce. Tequila, mezcal and sotol are a significant presence on the bar display, and the drinks are by Trey Bliss, who was at Mr. Bazdarichs now-closed Xilonen. Examples of folk art and works by local New York artists are displayed throughout. This is not Mr. McDonalds debut in Mexican restaurants: He helped start the Dos Caminos chain with Stephen Hanson, and was the owner of El Toro Blanco in the West Village, which closed during the pandemic and became Hancock St. (Opens Feb. 28)",2022-02-15T18:09:03+0000

us,Law & Order Is Having an Identity Crisis,"If you were going to watch a police procedural  which, for the record, I dont particularly recommend  you could do worse than NBCs Law & Order franchise. Across 32 years and more than 1,200 episodes, the original series and its six American spinoffs have offered a gentle critique of law enforcement, presenting a parade of flawed individuals navigating a byzantine justice system. Detectives are stymied by bureaucrats and squabble with lunkhead patrol officers, who reliably contaminate crime scenes. Idealistic prosecutors grow disillusioned and leave for nonprofit work. And yet the franchise still hinges on a lesser-of-two-evils logic: The institutions may be imperfect, and the cops imperfect, but their vocation is, by definition, good. There are always more victims to avenge, and none better equipped to do it than the New York Police Department.",2022-02-16T10:00:08+0000

us,See (the Worst People in) the World!,"It was the German shepherd in Row 4 that finally pushed Veronica, a flight attendant, over the edge. He was Veronicas third unruly passenger, as the Federal Aviation Administration calls them, in one month. A week or two before the dog, a middle-aged man reacted belligerently when, just before he boarded the plane, Veronica asked him to pull up his mask. Who do you think you are, you liberals?! he screamed at her. These masks dont work. Then he threatened to punch her in the face. About a week before, it was a group of young female athletes. The girls kept removing their masks when they talked to one another, and Veronica, who was working the back of the plane near the girls, repeatedly reminded them: Please put your mask on. (She and most other attendants asked me not to use their full names, either because an airlines media policy does not allow them to speak without permission or for fear that doing so might hinder their employment.) Please put your mask on, a girl mocked Veronica each time she said it. When the girl got up to go to the bathroom, without a mask, Veronica asked again. The girl, who was about 5-foot-10 and towered over Veronicas 5-foot-2 frame, said: Im so sick and tired of you, bitch. You dont have authority over me. They were almost body to body in the cramped area near the lavatory, and Veronica feared the girl was about to hit her, before one of the coaches intervened.",2022-02-16T10:00:10+0000

Raff, an anthropological geneticist at the University of Kansas, writes in her introduction, Looking at the genetic evidence, we will examine the ways in which DNA has challenged and changed our understanding of Native American history, with a special focus on the events that are only indirectly understandable with the archaeological record. Her approach will be accessible to the pickiest readers, layering personal anecdotes with a visit to a gene-sequencing lab, heavy on compassion and light on jargon. A Goodreads reviewer put it like this about Raff: As a young mother she cant help but impart some poignancy in her accounts of those burial sites where toddlers are interred. In doing so she highlights  as she does throughout the book  the humanity of the person whose remains are the subject of research. Origin is Raffs first book, and it lands on the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 8.",2022-02-17T10:00:03+0000

This poems brilliance (and wounds) register through languages sonic playfulness, as if to say that language is the only way to clap back at grief.

Three years later, Webb left the South to make a name for himself in Manhattan, where the brand was officially established in 1948 with a shop on West 46th Street. By the late 50s, Webb, who collected childrens books on wild beasts and made weekly pilgrimages to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to study Scythian and ancient Egyptian gold artifacts, had become best known for his enameled animal pieces. Banishing barnyard and household creatures from his jewels, the designer, who died in 1975 at the age of 50, favored a far more exotic and mythical menagerie of big cats, zebras, frogs and more. His creations  from compacts shaped like tortoises to carved coral bracelets inspired by the Hindu makara sea dragon  were coveted by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Vreeland and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and were, as one society reporter wrote, as essential as the food and drink at La Grenouille to the fashion society clan.",2022-02-18T13:00:08+0000

The City Press states that owing to the fact that the Queen does not desire to undergo the fatigue of leaving her carriage and ascending the steps of the cathedral, the service will be held on the western steps, The Royal carriage being drawn up in the open space before the West front. The Westminster Gazette says such a service would be unique in the annals of the City Cathedral. Meanwhile, writes a representative of that paper who has been making inquiries, it would be injudicious to assume the accuracy of the foregoing statement, seeing that nothing has, as yet, been decided on the subject whatever, and so far as the Cathedral authorities are concerned, at all events, it is very doubtful whether they would lend their approval to any such scheme as that foreshadowed, the objections to which, it is urged, are many and serious.

us,Fasano Opens in the Former Four Seasons Space,"For this new restaurant, the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld has not radically disrupted his design for the Four Seasons 2.0, which briefly occupied the space until 2019. He repeated the tawny tones of the wood-paneled main dining room, but now the floor is carpeted, the lighting is softer and wood dividers separate some tables. It is the first New York restaurant for the Fasano Group, a restaurant and hotel powerhouse based in So Paulo, Brazil. (Mr. Weinfeld has designed a number of the groups many properties.) Gero Fasano, who runs the company in partnership with the developers JHSF, said the new restaurant had to be warmer, more appealing and better for sound. The food is expense-account Northern Italian, mostly traditional and often elaborate, including bollito misto dispensed from a silver cart. The former bar in the front room is now a more informal osteria with linen place mats instead of tablecloths, a huge bar along the windows and a somewhat simpler menu written on smoky mirrors (think spaghetti with tomato sauce and no risotti). The wine selection is global. There is no art on the walls in the dining areas. In late March, outdoor seating will be added, and, upstairs in a few months, there will be a spacious cabaret. Mr. Fasanos company was founded in 1902 when his Milanese great-grandfather emigrated to Brazil. The family was in and out of the restaurant business over the decades until Mr. Fasano, against the advice of his father who made his fortune in distilleries, plunged in and has applied his exacting standards ever since. The executive chef, Nicola Fedeli, a Florentine who has worked with the company for several years, adheres to Mr. Fasanos strict demands as to preparation and presentation. Theres no New York-style salad on top of the oversize, impossibly thin $70 veal Milanese; its served on the side lest the veal get soggy. (Opens Friday) ",2022-02-22T16:47:20+0000

Containers are supplied to the restaurants at no charge; customers, who pay a 99-cent fee added to their bills, can return them to any restaurant in the companys network. The polypropylene plastic containers, which can be microwaved and withstand a commercial dishwasher, are cleaned and reused by the restaurants. Late last year, DoorDash and Caviar signed on for what Mr. Farbiarz said was a pilot program, and began offering the containers as an option when an order is placed at participating restaurants on their platforms.

It sold out quickly when it was introduced in 2019 on a limited basis on Flaviar, an online spirits club, and its now being sold in liquor stores in New York. It was inspired by a Revolutionary War-era recipe and named for an 18th century Irishman, a tailor, who emigrated to New York and also spied on the English.

The book, by most of the partners in the Dead Rabbit, an esteemed bar in Lower Manhattan, is an up-to-date treatise on the whiskey, defining its four styles: pot still, malt, grain and blended. There are details for about 50 labels, and the book serves as a technical primer on Irish whiskey cocktails and how to build them. Following recipes for six classics, there are scores of Dead Rabbit creations, most of which call for esoteric ingredients like tonka bean syrup, zaatar tincture and toasted fennel salt (recipes are provided). There are a few more pantry-friendly options, like the head bartender Jillian Voses deliciously bitter Broadway Junction and the Precision Pilot, which she said was one of the first drinks she created at the bar.",2022-02-28T16:35:21+0000

The zaatar is a brighter green with a somewhat mintier flavor than most; the tahini (tahiniyeh) has a more fluid consistency, making it easier to drizzle and to use for dressings; and the shatta chile paste comes in both a forcefully spicy and red version, like harissa, and in a somewhat milder and denser green version seasoned with zaatar that can be nicely mellowed by mixing it with olive oil.

They also point out that the United States does not have the defined traditions of other countries known for cutlery, so its easier to innovate.
