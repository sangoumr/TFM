But economic growth is likely to be far below Administration pro- jections, and budget deficits far higher, he predicts. The combination will keep interest rates high and temper investment enthusiasm. Continuing high rates of interest will not only make external financing difficult, but will keep the dollar strong, Mr. Chimerine expects, hurting exports and jeopardizing industries vulnerable to imports. Since fighting inflation seems to be Mr. Reagan's first priority, Robert Gough of Data Resources, Inc. doubts the Administration would be greatly concerned if investment showed only modest growth over the next few years.

When she was forced to resign earlier this year as general manager of the company she helped found 26 years ago, Lyric Opera of Chicago, I had trouble imagining what that city would do without her. I still do. She was one of those unswervable people who plow ahead, pushing everything out of the way and creating a wake in which the timorous are swept along behind. Somehow, her death the other day at age 55 of a heart attack, the last in a series of illnesses and accidents that left her crippled in body and somewhat subdued in spirit, did not seem as surprising as it should have. For more than a quarter century, Lyric Opera had been her life, and she had lost that life when she was forced to quit. It always had been impossible to think of the company without thinking of Carol Fox. She wanted it that way, and that is how it was.

As a result, the alignment of the tape within the shell gets skewed and it will no longer play properly. At best, the highs are lost due to improper contact between the tape and the magnetic head in your car stereo player or the music fades in and out erratically.

But the drawing, as it turned out, was totally wrong, leading some to speculate that WWD was playing a joke on its readers. But according to Michael Coady, the editor, ''We never really said that this was The Dress. John Fairchild, our publisher, thought it was a hoax all along. And if you take off the overslip and the accessories and add the long train the Princess wore, the drawing could have been a very early draft of it.''",1981-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,News Summary,"SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1981 International Solidarity was harshly attacked by the Polish Government, which accused the trade union of ''aggressive and arrogant behavior'' and of undermining talks aimed at ending the crisis over food shortages. One of the Government's strongest criticisms of the union was made public while several hundred workers in the southern industrial and mining region of Silesia struck for four hours over food shortages and the Government's handling of the country's economic troubles. It appeared that talks between the union's leaders and the Government might be halted, at least temporarily. (Page 1, Column 6.) Moscow renewed its harsh attacks on the independent union in Poland. The official newpapers have offered versions of events in Poland that suggested that Soviet leaders' forebearance is once again being strained. Western diplomats who have been observing the Kremlin's reaction to the Polish crisis doubt that any overt intervention is planned, despite the largest maneuvers ever held by the Soviet Navy off Poland's Baltic coast.

With ''Marat/Sade,'' audience and actors were confined in the insane asylum at Charenton for an evening of revolutionary theater. His production of ''Timon of Athens'' in Paris turned Timon into the equivalent of a modern political exile, scuttering crablike into the desert.

These are designed to produce far more radiation and far less blast and heat than other tactical nuclear weapons and to kill people without severe damage to their surroundings. The President adopted the new weapons policy despite warnings that it would lead a storm of protests in Western Europe, the officials said. (Page 1, Column 6.)

And omelets are conceivably the most versatile of any dish. There is almost no limit to the number of leftovers or raw foods that can be incorporated into an omelet; the filling depends on the imagination and inventiveness of the cook. One may saute leftover potatoes in a little butter to make a ''peasant'' omelet. Or one may use leftover tomato sauce, excess crumbled bacon or almost any raw vegetable to dress it up. Even leftover sandwich fillings, such as chicken or tuna in mayonnaise, make unexpected, tasty additions to the basic omelet.",1981-08-09T05:00:00+0000

After the three-hour shutdown, new routes were arranged, permitting a resumption of flights between the United States and Europe. The F.A.A.'s order was the most dramatic indication that the eight-day-old strike by 12,000 controllers was beginning to have some effect. Members of the Canadian controllers' union said they considered airspace over the United States to be unsafe. New York, Washington, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were affected. (Page A1, Col.6.) Trans-Atlantic air travel was marked by confusion as international airlines and governmental aviation officials reacted to a report of action taken by Canadian air traffic controllers. In addition to the disruptions, almost all flights between the United States and Canada were grounded and some domestic and other international flights were delayed.

Louis Cartier made the first Santos in 1904 for an aviator friend, Alberto Santos Dumont. The Tank watch was originally intended for the American tank corps of World War I. Now, with a legion of fans for the wristwatches, Cartier has translated the same designs into travel clocks, with the company's C's forming the legs the clocks stand on. The rectangular tank clock is banded in black, wine, ivory or blue enamel; the square Santos clock is set in plain and gold-plated steel. Both have Roman numerals on white faces and alarms that sound like pizzicato on a violin. They're in the Les Must boutique at Cartier, priced at $275 for either model. 2.Shoes in Hues Victor Favuzza, president of the Fast Feet boutique, thought he had just about all the gear that joggers and other athletes might want. But customers kept asking for running shoes in colors to match their outfits, while the big shoe manufacturers confined their output to just a few standard shades. So Mr. Favuzza, who has a father in the textile business and a father-in-law in carpets, consulted with them about dyeing shoes in unstandard colors. What he has done is take the Nike ''Spirit'' shoe in its original white and dye it in wonderful shades such as bright yellow, pink, lavender, pale blue and brick red.",1981-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Only a trickle of North Atlantic traffic to and from this country operated, and the possibility was raised that these flights might also be halted by a sympathetic job action. The disruption of trans-Atlantic routes added the biggest measure of strength yet to the cause of the United States controllers. But there was no sign that the development was swaying the Reagan Administration from its intent to rebuild the traffic system without the employees who struck. (Page A1, Column 6.) Transport Canada officials announced a new controllers' agreement to resume ''normal air traffic service operations'' at Gander, Newfoundland. Earlier, an agreement with the controllers collapsed and the Canadian Government said that its airspace would remain closed to flights to and from Europe. (A1:6.) Passengers were stranded by the thousands in airports across Europe as widespread flight delays and cancellations of transatlantic flights were again reported as a result of job actions by Canadian controllers.

He returned on April 11. This letter, written to a friend of Father Rother in Oklahoma City, was made available by William L.

Probably the most sought-after catechist has been staying here in the rectory off and on, and almost constantly of late. He had been eating and sleeping here, and usually visiting his wife and two kids in late afternoon. He had a key to the house, and as he was approaching Saturday night about 7:45, he was intercepted by a group of four kidnappers. Three apparently tried to grab him at the far side of the church. He got to within 15 feet of the door and was holding on to the bannister and yelling for help. The other priest heard the ruckus outside and stepped out to see them trying to take him. He considered trying to help, but was scared by their height. He called me from the living room where I was listening to music but also heard the noise, and by the time I realized what was happening, grabbed a jacket and got outside, they had taken him down the front steps of the church and were putting him in a waiting car. In the process they had broken the bannister where the rectory porch joins the church, and I just stood there wanting to jump down to help, but knowing that I would be killed or taken along also.

John H. Fenton, chief administrative law judge of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which oversees the Government's labormanagement relations, urged the agency to revoke the union's ''exclusive recognition status.'' If the recommendation is accepted by the three-member board, the union's right to represent the controllers would immediately be taken away. (Page 1, Column 1.) Flight attendant unions rallied to support the striking controllers, although many of the union members individually expressed little sympathy for the controllers' strike. As notices of impending layoffs of pilots, attendants and ground crews were being issued by some airlines, representatives of six flight attendants' unions conferred urgently, concerned that if the controllers' union is broken their own unions might be imperiled.

Along with many other Americans, the President clearly would prefer to wait until our military strength is so overwhelming that we could not possibly lose out in a negotiating process. The new military budget is the price we pay for a strong negotiating position.","Implicit in this attitude is the notion that whenever Soviet and American negotiators sit down together, we end up the losers. This view was heard frequently during the debate on the second strategic nuclear arms treaty. Not without pride, critics of the treaty pointed out that Soviet leaders, with no need to respond to domestic opinion, could plan and execute their strategy with the freedom of chess players while American negotiators had to contend with the intrusion of Congressional activists. It was also argued that democratic elections, because they cause us to change negotiating teams frequently, give the unchanging Soviet negotiators a further edge.

''The music industry,'' he said, ''has traditionally been a bunch of whores, amateurs and egomaniacs. That must change. The fat years are gone. In order to survive as an industry, we've got to professionalize. I, for instance, am growing accustomed to seeing myself not merely as the manager of a rock band, but as executive vice president of a large-volume retail operation.'' The retail outfit to which Sutton was referring is Styx, a rock band he manages which is scheduled to appear this week at Madison Square Garden as part of a world tour. The ''Paradise Theater'' tour, billed as the largest in rock-music history, could bring the group $15 million in ticket sales. Their current ''Paradise Theater'' album on A&M Records has sold almost three million copies, and if it tops that mark, as it is expected to, the record will be Styx's fourth consecutive ''triple platinum'' album - something not even the Beatles or the Bee Gees ever accomplished.

The meeting, according to many participants, was one of the most divisive and difficult ever held by the cartel. The world's major oil exporters failed to reach an agreement on a new strategy for preventing a further decline in oil prices in a glutted market. Saudi Arabia did not support the strategy effort.

Mr. Cage became, instead, one of the leading philosophers and wits in 20thcentury music, a man whose influence went on expanding even while his composing pretensions seemed to shrink. Especially in his early years, Mr. Cage produced some original and captivating works, such as the Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano (1946-48). However, if I were to be asked to name the Cage works that might still have an audience in 2001, I would restrict my list to four: ''Silence'' (1961), ''A Year from Monday'' (1967), ''M'' (1973), and ''For the Birds'' (1981).",1981-08-23T05:00:00+0000

But while the Israeli coup nearly doubled Israel's missile-equipped naval force and contributed materially to its victory over the Egyptian and Syrian navies in October 1973, the Iranian operation was merely a publicity stunt.  Even with the delivery of all three of the missile boats that were in the convoy - and which were handed over by France without their American-made missiles - much of the Iranian Navy may soon be fit only for mothballs.","Less than four years ago, such a statement would have been preposterous.

Haig Jr. of playing major roles in the fomenting of civil war in EL Salvador, and he accused the country's rebels of engaging in ''straight terrorism'' against the civilian population. His remarks were made at a news conference at the State Department after an announcement by France and Mexico that they had recognized the rebels as a ''representative political force.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) The joint French-Mexican statement presented to the United Nations Security Council was apparently a challenge to American policy on El Salvador. It said that, in addition to recognizing the Salvadoran guerrilla-led opposition as a ''representative political force,'' the opposition had a right to participate in negotiations aimed at ending the fighting. The statement also called for reorganization of the Salvadoran armed forces before ''authentically free'' elections could be held. The French-Mexican proposals run directly counter to the Reagan Administration's policy, which seeks the military defeat of the guerrillas and their exclusion from elections for a constitutionl assembly, scheduled in March.

But Miss Khan doesn't just jump from idiom to idiom depending on the song. Her stylistic vagaries come as the natural extensions of a vivid and integral musical personality. And on the stage at the Savoy on Thursday, where she was backed by an excellent eight-piece band, that personality was in full flower.",1981-08-30T05:00:00+0000

Last time we were there, during the waning days of a glorious autumn, we packed into the woods, hiked more than 20 miles and then canoed down the Indian River and through the Chain of Lakes area. We are not particularly athletic nor did we engage in any rigorous preparations. It was fairly easy terrain, actually, and not quite whitewater canoeing, but it beats television watching by a million miles.",1981-08-30T05:00:00+0000

The barely perceived figures do not look at me as they recede into a vast and milky distance, and one night, echoing the unknown woman's cry, I call to them. ''Laura, John, Lee - are you there?'' A sucking noise in the hall, and then a gentle voice from my doorway. ''They're here,'' the nurse says. ''Go to sleep.''",1981-08-30T05:00:00+0000

Two filthy young ''roughnecks'' in hard hats, jeans, flannel shirts and boots struggle to guide the 900-pound section of carbon steel into place - and to keep themselves in place on the rig floor slick with mud. They do not talk to each other; they shout, because of the noise. An oil rig is a giant monument to Rube Goldberg, and the young laborers on it work in exhausting, perpetual motion, pushing at it here, pulling there, adjusting here, readjusting there. ''This pace goes on around the clock,'' yells Dale H. Shoemaker, a lean, crisp 28-year-old petroleum engineer for Standard Oil Company (Indiana), ''... 24 hours a day, seven days a week.''
