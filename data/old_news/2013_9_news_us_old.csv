Mr. Cousins, a film critic from Northern Ireland, aims for comprehensiveness and coherence, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this 900-minute movie, presented in eight chapters. He wants to tell the whole story, from Genesis to Revelation, as the saying goes, but he also wants this vast chronicle to have a shape and a point: themes and patterns amid the names, places and images. He succeeds to an impressive extent. The results of his dogged research, compulsive travel and hard thinking are exemplary, useful and sometimes thrilling. Mr. Cousins and Robert Osborne will introduce each Monday episode, which begins here with movies from Thomas Edisons New Jersey studio, at 8, and the Lumire brothers French studio, at 9:30, and Birth of the Cinema (1900-1920), the first episode of Mr. Cousinss film, at 10. Georges Mliss short Trip to the Moon (1902), follows at 11:15, and Alice Guy-Blachs shorts Falling Leaves (1912), Canned Harmony (1912) and A House Divided (1913), at 11:30. The lineup concludes with three silent films: Oscar C. Apfels Squaw Man (1914), about a wrongly accused Englishman who escapes to Wyoming and takes an American Indian bride, at 12:30 a.m.; D. W. Griffiths Civil War epic, The Birth of a Nation (1915), at 2; and his Orphans of the Storm (1921), above, starring Lillian and Dorothy Gish as sisters struggling to find each other during the French Revolution, at 5:15.",2013-09-02T04:15:04+0000

(MoreMax) MAGIC MIKE (2012) In a role loosely inspired by his stint as a stripper in Florida, Channing Tatum, above center, stars as the gyrating main attraction at the Xquisite dance club, in what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called Steven Soderberghs funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream. Alex Pettyfer plays Adam, a college dropout who is pushed onstage at Xquisite. At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonnas Like a Virgin begins to throb. What happens will be familiar if youve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie, Ms. Dargis wrote. In the past, the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here, the stress is on Mikes struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture. She added: The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movies misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatums heat and charm  and ambitions that are as transparent as Mikes  with Mr. Soderberghs cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.

There was no garbage in the streets and none of the black plastic bags that get tangled up in the fences and trees of so many other African cities  Kagames government has banned them. There were no homeless youth sleeping on the sidewalks or huffing glue to kill their hunger. In Rwanda, vagrants and petty criminals have been scooped up by the police and sent to a youth rehabilitation center on an island in the middle of Lake Kivu that some Rwandan officials jokingly call their Hawaii  because it is so lush and beautiful  though people in Kigali whisper about it as if it were Alcatraz.

(FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, Marcus, a solemn boy, feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left Marcus adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Ccile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood, A. O. Scott said in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. What does seem new  newly strange, newly beautiful  is what Hereafter makes of the here and now, Mr. Scott added. It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand.

A stuffed goat, a torn shirt or tie, a wheelbarrow and even his own bed  all became fodder for paintings or sculptures, which would later incorporate sound and electronics as well. Rauschenberg had a counterpart in the Swiss-born Jean Tinguely, who had his debut at the Museum of Modern Art after arriving in New York in January 1960. The show consisted of a gigantic motorized sculpture assembled from bicycle wheels, a piano, a bathtub and other detritus, which was designed to self-destruct in flames before a live audience. Rauschenberg made an ad hoc contribution to the piece with a toaster that spit out silver dollars. That collaboration spurred a lifelong friendship that would embrace other bricoleurs of the French New Realist group then living in New York: Arman, Martial Raysse and Tinguelys future wife, Niki de Saint Phalle  all artists who subscribed to Rauschenbergs belief in closing the gap between art and life.

Why then, did they nevertheless continue to believe that a crime had occurred?

Russia is already facing a barrage of international criticism, including some calls for a boycott of the coming Winter Olympics in Sochi, over a new law that bars propaganda on nontraditional sexual relationships. Supporters of the law say it is intended to protect children, while critics argue that it is a transparent effort by officials to suppress homosexuality. In an interview with The Associated Press and the state-controlled Channel 1 television station that was made public on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin insisted that gay men and lesbians do not face government-sanctioned discrimination. The legislation was introduced this week by Aleksei Zhuravlyov, a member of United Russia, the party that nominated Mr. Putin for president and controls a majority in the Duma.

(Starz) ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012) Jessica Chastain, in an Oscar-nominated role, portrays Maya, a C.I.A. officer obsessed with finding Osama bin Laden, in Kathryn Bigelows fictionalized intelligence procedural. (Above, Ms. Chastain with Christopher Stanley.) Tushaar Mehra is Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the lead that Maya and her colleagues, including Dan (Jason Clarke) and Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), chase over the next eight years, using controversial interrogation techniques on prisoners to extract information. The abuse scenes are crucial to Zero Dark Thirty because they serve as a claim  one made cinematically rather than with speeches  that these interrogation methods are unreliable when it comes to producing actionable information, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. To omit them would have been a reprehensible act of moral cowardice. She added: Ms. Bigelows direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. Its pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically nontriumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before  the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals  has led to this.",2013-09-06T05:00:04+0000

The danger increased when catchers, who had stood two dozen feet behind the batter, moved closer to the plate  an innovation, says the baseball historian Peter Morris, that allowed the top pitchers to throw their best pitches. The facial injuries finally decreased when a team from Harvard University rigged up a mask to protect its catchers that resembled a sturdy bird cage. The manager of the team, Frederick Thayer, patented the mask in 1878. Fans hated it. When the Harvard catcher James Tyng stepped onto the field with his head swaddled in steel and leather, he endured jeers from the crowd  people hooted at the mad dog who had to be muzzled. Editorial writers complained that the innovation detracted from the game. What was next  a lightning rod to save the catcher from freak storms?

Another is that the biological details of just what cancer is and how it occurs are (forgive me for saying so) fascinating.

A wisp of a thing, barely more than twice the length of this review, it contains little action, less plot. It doesnt seem to be about anything  except a whole life. We meet the unnamed protagonist as a child clearing ice-cream dishes from the family dinner table, surreptitiously licking the creamy dregs from each one. We glimpse her as a teenager necking on the couch, as a young wife reveling in the domestic sensuality of motherhood, as an older woman attending her husbands deathbed, even then unable to keep from physical contact, her open lips brushing . . . the surgical tape that secured the respirator in his mouth. In the end, Alice McDermotts Enough is a portrait of a woman filtered through a sensory lens, capturing the life of the body, replete with exultation and ache. Which means this is also a story about mortality.",2013-09-06T15:05:58+0000

Only one last name goes with Norman, and that was nabbed by Mailer. Rush couldnt be more inappropriate; Norman has never been in a. . . . His first book, Whites, a story collection, was published in 1986, when he was 53. Between that and Subtle Bodies there have been just two novels: a long one, Mating, and the even longer Mortals. Its not the frequency of these sturdy ol buses so much as their speed that is remarkable, their emphatic rejection of notions of narrative urgency. Walking, to put it oxymoronically, is Rushs preferred pace. In Mating the narrator recounts how she hiked to a utopian village presided over by the enigmatic Denoon, on whom she had developed a high-I.Q. crush. This was not a stroll to Fruitlands in Massachusetts; it was a trek through the Kalahari. She barely made it, almost gave up the ghost. Me too. ",2013-09-06T15:06:18+0000

Unlike most journalists, Pargaien reported from the scene while perched on the shoulders of a flood victim in the middle of a swollen river.

us,The Ad Campaign: Spitzer Attacks Stringer on Term Limits,"With polls suggesting that the Democratic primary for New York City comptroller is a dead heat, Eliot Spitzer has started airing the first negative television ad of the campaign. Titled Our Voice, it accuses his rival, Scott M. Stringer, of having cut a back-room deal to lift term limits and allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term. The Spitzer campaign also started airing a Spanish-language version of the ad and a similar one on the radio.PRODUCER Siegel StrategiesTHE SCRIPT Voice-over: Term limits were voted in by the people, until 20-year career politician Scott Stringer worked to destroy them, cutting a back-room deal to hand a third term to the mayor against the peoples will, even testifying before the City Council to get it done. Eliot Spitzer has always fought against the same special interests and back-room politicians supporting Stringer. Because Stringer didnt only take away our term limits. He took away our voice. But this Sept. 10, we get to use it.ON SCREEN The music, brassy and solemnly patriotic, sounds ripped from the score of a Western. There are images of Mr. Stringer, including one with Mr. Bloomberg, and a graphic of a piece of paper with Term Limits written on it being gradually torn to shreds. A phrase from a Christian Science Monitor article about the term-limits debate (counter to the will of the voters) flashes across the screen. As the music shifts to a more hopeful mode, the ad closes with images of Mr. Spitzer shaking hands with voters and patting them on the back, and a close-up on a Hispanic woman and a black man standing next to Mr. Spitzer.ACCURACY Mr. Stringer did testify before the Council in 2008, urging members to vote to extend term limits to 12 years, from 8 years. There is no evidence, however, that he was part of any back-room deal to hand Mr. Bloomberg a third term. He endorsed Mr. Bloombergs 2009 opponent, William C. Thompson Jr.As to whether Mr. Spitzer fought against the same special interests and back-room politicians that support Mr. Stringer, the claim is so broad that it is hard to quantify its measure of truth. If special interests refers to the unions that have endorsed Mr. Stringer, Mr. Spitzer was himself endorsed in previous campaigns by some of the same groups. However, as governor he also prominently clashed with one of the unions backing Mr. Stringer, 1199 S.E.I.U., over cuts that he proposed to health care. Mr. Stringer, like most major New York City candidates who are not self-financing, has accepted donations from people working on Wall Street. As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer led investigations into financial industry practices and made many enemies on Wall Street. The former governor is financing his campaign with money from his familys real estate fortune.SCORECARD Although Mr. Stringer did support lifting term limits to allow Mr. Bloomberg to run for a third term, his role in the debate was minor. To accuse him of being part of a back-room deal is misleading. And although Mr. Stringer has been heavily supported by labor, a political action committee that threatened to raise major Wall Street money to back him has fizzled. The ad speaks to the caustic tone the campaign has taken in its final days; soon after this ad began airing on Thursday, the Stringer campaign went up with its own negative ad.",2013-09-06T19:52:27+0000
us,The Ad Campaign: Stringer Says Spitzer Held Himself to a Different Standard,"Hours after Eliot Spitzer started broadcasting the first negative television commercial in the Democratic primary for comptroller, his opponent, Scott M. Stringer, responded with his own negative spot. Titled Clear Choice, it invokes the prostitution scandal that led Mr. Spitzer to resign as governor in 2008.PRODUCER GMMBTHE SCRIPT Announcer: The Times, Post and Daily News all endorse Scott Stringer. Hell audit every city agency to cut waste so we can invest in jobs and schools. And he far outdistances Eliot Spitzer in integrity. Spitzer jailed people for prostitution and financial crimes, but when he got caught doing the very same thing, he held himself to a different standard, and walked away scot-free. Thats why The Times, Post and Daily News all say the choice is clear: Scott Stringer, comptroller.ON SCREEN The announcer speaks over what sounds like the upbeat theme music for an evening newscast, while the screen shows images of Mr. Stringer at his desk and talking to a man in a pharmacists coat, a flyover picture of City Hall and an image of a school hallway. When the narrator mentions Mr. Spitzers putting people in jail, a person is shown from the back in handcuffs. This is followed by black-and-white images of Mr. Spitzer, with the words Same Crimes and Different Standard and a CNN headline  Spitzer Wont Be Charged in Prostitution Scandal  flashing on the screen. The ad ends with an image of the New York skyline and a photograph of Mr. Stringer on the Brooklyn Bridge.ACCURACY As far as prostitution goes, the ad is accurate. As governor, Mr. Spitzer was caught patronizing prostitutes, precipitating his resignation. The assertion that he committed financial crimes, however, is misleading. In announcing that they would not charge Mr. Spitzer, federal prosecutors said there was insufficient evident to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to to the prostitution ring. The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post have all endorsed Mr. Stringer.SCORECARD If Mr. Stringer stuck to reminding voters that Mr. Spitzer patronized prostitutes  something that few have likely forgotten  he would be on solid ground. Bringing in financial crimes stretches the truth and the available evidence.",2013-09-06T19:53:26+0000

John Goodman and Alan Arkin play the Hollywood makeup artist and producer who assist him in his mission. Bryan Cranston, his neck tendons popping, is one of his bosses; and Clea DuVall, Tate Donovan, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham and Kerry Bish are the escapees.

But at the Alexander Wang show this evening, there wasnt a speck of foundation, eye shadow or lipstick anywhere in sight. I call it raw beauty, the makeup artist Diane Kendal said of the barely-there, extreme-minimalist look she created backstage. Proving the point, her routine took all of five minutes: she patted Nars Skin Aqua Gel Luminous Oil-Free Moisturizer on the skin to give it a nice luminous quality and dotted stick concealer down the sides of the nose and over any blemishes or redness. Lashes were curled; arches were set with a quick pass of brow gel. And thats it. Its actually hard to tell which models have their makeup done and which dont, one observer noted, puzzled. Kendal couldnt be happier about that. Alexander loved that the girls looked so cool [when they came in for casting], she said. So we agreed that the more you do with makeup, the less cool it looks. The models seemed to embrace the no-fuss effect. Its very au naturel, Joan Smalls said, adding that this is the fastest makeup Ive had done for a show. Jourdan Dunn called the pared-down approach laid-back and easy, while Hanne Gaby Odiele said, Its simple but fresh; its like how we walked in  but a little less tired.",2013-09-08T00:46:09+0000

us,Why Roger Federer Is the Greatest of All Time,"Roger Federer, who I wrote about in the magazines U.S. Open issue, was the big story coming into the Open; the state of his game dominated the conversation for most of the tournament. But the big story coming out of the Open is his longtime nemesis, Rafael Nadal, who won the mens title last night with an enthralling four-set victory over the world No. 1, Novak Djokovic. The win gives the 27-year-old Spaniard his 13th grand-slam singles title at exactly the same age that Federer won his 13th, which leaves the whole GOAT debate even more unsettled. GOAT? Thats short for greatest of all time and is an acronym that has been tossed around promiscuously during the Federer years. With a record 17 majors highlighting his numerous career achievements, Federer has staked a strong claim to GOAT status. But he has a losing record against Nadal, and a lopsided one at that. The two have played 31 times since 2004, and Nadal has won 21 of those matches. Federers record against Nadal is a large blot on an otherwise remarkable rsum. How can you be considered the greatest player ever if you were arguably not even the best player of your own era? When I spoke with Federer at Wimbledon, he didnt object when I noted that some feel that Nadal ought to be regarded as the finest male player of all time.

My genius assistant and I worked on them in between fittings and shows, the stylist noted. Having done that work in advance allowed Gilbert to streamline her routine backstage: she applied John Frieda Frizz-Ease Curl Reviver Styling Mousse before blow-drying, curling and parting hair far over to one side. The extensions were then glued in a diagonal band across the head, while the rest of the hair was pulled into a small side knot below the ear. The peekaboo effect of the print was particularly striking on the bleach-blonde model Soo Joo Park, who gave it a thumbs up as far as street-style trends go.

It can be seen in Napoleone Martinuzzi: Venini 1925-1931, an exhibition through Dec. 1 at Le Stanze del Vetro on San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. A show theme is the friendship between Mr. Martinuzzi and the poet Gabriele DAnnunzio, who commissioned intensely colorful, intricate works, like a pumpkin made of layered glass. Martinuzzi brought the tradition of Murano glass into the modern era, said the shows curator, Marino Barovier, and his work is rich in energy and saturated with a surprisingly contemporary taste.

Ms. Rockefeller, the youngest of David and Peggy Rockefellers six children, and a great-granddaughter of John D., grew up between a town house in Manhattan, a farm in Tarrytown, N.Y., a house in St. Barts and another in Maine, and struggled with shyness and undiagnosed dyslexia. Yet the star of the memoir may be Ms. Rockefellers mother, Peggy, who battled depression and the exigencies of her role as a Rockefeller wife with an antic wit and a passion for rural life, both of which qualities she worked hard to instill in her children. After Peggy bought a 20-acre island in Maine for $300 from a lobsterman (private island alert), she and her three youngest children built a cabin there by themselves, along with an outhouse, stone wall and vegetable garden.",2013-09-11T22:31:06+0000

Its a color thats not an obvious color, and thats what makes it work on so many different complexions, the designer said of the shade worn by his entire cast of models, including Karolina Kurkova, Joan Smalls and Liu Wen. Page applied the hue, blotted it, and then set it by brushing powder onto one layer of tissue that had been pressed to the lips to diffuse the color and pull it out of focus, he explained. The finishing touch? Bronzer. Im bronzer obsessed! Kors admitted, which explains the generously sized compacts of his labels Sporty Bronze Powder used backstage (If I had a horse who needed bronzing, theres enough product in here! quipped Page). It all came together to create a relaxed, just-back-from-holiday look, which the model Karmen Pedaru easily channeled: she was spotted sitting outside, soaking up a bit of sun, moments before opening the show.",2013-09-11T23:30:30+0000

But tests on the oil remaining in tank cars that survived the crash found that it belonged in a more explosive category that includes gasoline. Questions had been raised about why the explosion had been so devastating, given the relatively low volatility of most crude oil. Mr. Ross said that accurate labeling would not have required the use of stronger tank cars or altered the actions of firefighters, but investigators are eventually expected to make new safety recommendations based on their findings.

General Idea presented its sleek separates inside the Classic Car Club, where models walked in front of a pair of antique roadsters that set the tone for the labels mesh and reflective jackets. Tim Coppens took his collection to the track, outfitting his crew whose members carried racing helmets as the accessory du jour in long and short sleeveless jumpsuits and classic racing leathers. Backstage at Siki Im, models dressed amid parked cars before the show began inside an old garage. Opening Ceremony showed both mens and womens looks in its very first runway, but the setting and presentation was decidedly masculine: an army of models flooded the vast space at the SuperPier, all at once, chauffeured by a stream of shiny cars. And the satin bomber jackets, like the one Gosling wears in Drive, were in no short supply either. Bespoken, J.

(13, 49) FOYLES WAR, SERIES VII: THE ETERNITY RING This Masterpiece Mystery! stalwart, starring Michael Kitchen as the tenacious detective Christopher Foyle and on hiatus since 2010, picks up in 1946, when one war has ended and a new one looms as the Iron Curtain falls across Europe. Foyle, now retired, has been recruited by the British intelligence agency MI5 and must investigate the possibility of a Soviet spy network in the heart of London. In the process he learns that his former driver, Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks, above, speaking to Mr. Kitchen), has been working for one of the suspects. As a quiet man who makes a religion of honor, responsibility and competence, Mr. Kitchen gives a performance that is, by current standards, miraculously understated, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. And though the series has advanced chronologically by only a year, its a different world, he said. This grayer, chillier Foyles War may not suit everyone, but its admirable, and a bit remarkable, that its creator and writer Anthony Horowitz has moved the show forward in a way that makes historical and dramatic sense. It wouldnt work, of course, if Mr. Kitchen did not remain at the center, communicating an entire worldview in the way he says Oh, I see or tells a weaselly major, Ive come to give you another opportunity to tell me the truth.

After his violent death (which happens fairly early in the novel), his devoted, dutiful brother, Subhash, marries his pregnant widow, Gauri, and brings her to America in hopes of giving her a new start in a new country. Their marriage, though, will remain haunted by their memories of Udayan and a terrible secret Gauri keeps to herself. ",2013-09-19T20:17:12+0000

But 36 years ago in Hollywood, when she was only 13, she was plied with Champagne and a quaalude, photographed topless, and raped by the 43-year-old Roman Polanski. And ever since, her privacy has been busted. Any time Polanski is in the news, Geimer is once again thrown back into reliving her invaded girlhood, an unwilling principal player in a story never satisfactorily concluded. And Polanski is in the news often, since the artistically impressive, Oscar-winning, Polish-French director who made Chinatown, Rosemarys Baby and The Pianist fled the United States in 1978 before final sentencing. The wrath of American justice, affronted as much by his defiance as by his crime, awaits him if he ever returns. Its a story that has become grimy with symbolism about Hollywood privilege, 1970s California indulgence, imperfect parenting, judicial pandering and inconsistency, tortured creative temperament, and the rights of rape victims.

Steps look natural, athletic and exploratory  even when they then come around a second or third time with other dancers.

Years later, the regiments historian reported that the rebel was loading them with imprecations of unique and vigorous character. Seeing the lieutenant, the thieves retreated, and the Union officer was surprised to discover that he had come to the aid of none other than Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams, commander of the Army of Tennessees Louisiana Brigade. ",2013-09-21T00:30:16+0000

(HBO) HITCHCOCK (2012) Anthony Hopkins, buried in a fat suit and facial prosthetics, summons the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock during the making of Psycho in this biopic, directed by Sacha Gervasi and based on a book by Stephen Rebello. But Hitchcock isnt merely taken with the inspiration behind his perverse shocker: Robert Blochs 1959 novel about the crimes of Ed Gein, a serial killer in Wisconsin who adorned his home with human body parts and walked around in the skin of his female victims. Hitchcock becomes possessed, enduring sleepless nights and, at the same time, marital troubles with his wife and adviser, Alma (Helen Mirren, above with Mr. Hopkins), who is dramatically unhappy about his fixation on blondes  in this case, Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). The real Hitchcocks great flaw, apparently, was that he was at once a genius and a private man, a combination that has allowed some writers and filmmakers to have their insultingly imaginative way with him, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while The Girl, on HBO, painted him as a pathetic sexual predator, this film takes a lighter, more strenuously comic if patronizing approach to the director, she said. Its fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.",2013-09-21T05:00:06+0000

About $7.9 billion from donors went to poor and middle-income countries last year. The amount has grown slowly after inflation for the past four years. Spending soared from 2002 to 2008 with the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and the Bush administrations Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The United States contributes almost 64 percent of the money. Britain gives 10 percent, France 5 percent, Germany 4 percent and Japan 3 percent. Measured as a percentage of gross national product, Denmark is the largest donor. Speeding up the disbursement of previously approved money increased the American contribution in 2012 to $5 billion from $4.5 billion.

The search for the two missing victims resumed Monday, a week after the capsized ship was righted during a complex salvage operation 20 months after the liner crashed into two granite reefs just off the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio. Experts have yet to go inside the parts of the ship that remained submerged for months after the shipwreck in January 2012. The captain, Francesco Schettino, went on trial this month on charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the vessel before all of the ships 4,229 passengers and crew members were safe.

According to the rules, which must be approved and put into place by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Atlantic herring fleet can incidentally catch no more than 311.4 metric tons of river herring and shad. The cap, which is the median of what managers estimate it caught over the past five years, will be implemented by zone and gear type. River herring and shad, whose populations are at historic lows, spend part of their lives at sea and run up rivers to spawn; hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on dam removal projects to foster a revival of the runs, but fishermen and conservationists have long warned the species also need protection at sea. The council also discussed the National Marine Fisheries Services decision this summer not to implement all of the measures the council approved last year to protect Atlantic herring, citing funding issues; the group tabled a motion to prohibit midwater trawling in the region until those rules are put into place.

Curators opened up the museums specimen storage rooms and lent artifacts, like beaded Native American dresses from the Blackfoot tribe, to design firms and department stores for inspiration.

(Showtime) LINCOLN (2012) Daniel Day-Lewis, below, in the role that won him his third Oscar for best actor, portrays Abraham Lincoln as he struggles to abolish slavery while the Civil War rages in this drama directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner. Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, his wife, who is grieving the death of their son Willie; Tommy Lee Jones is the abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, who, along with his fellow Republican radicals, is demanding a vote on a Constitutional amendment; Hal Holbrook is Preston Blair, a party conservative who prefers peace talks with the Confederacy that evade a decisive solution. And David Strathairn is William Seward, Lincolns secretary of state, who is willing to trade patronage jobs for votes in Congress. The genius of Lincoln, finally, lies in its vision of politics as a noble, sometimes clumsy dialectic of the exalted and the mundane, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Our habit of argument, someone said recently, is a mark of our liberty, and Mr. Kushner, whose love of passionate, exhaustive disputation is unmatched in the modern theater, fills nearly every scene with wonderful, maddening talk. Mr. Spielbergs best art often emerges in passages of wordlessness, when the images speak for themselves, and the way he composes his pictures and cuts between them endows the speeches and debates with emotional force, and reminds us of what is at stake. Lincoln, he added, is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece  an omen, perhaps, that movies for the people shall not perish from the earth. ",2013-09-28T05:00:06+0000

Masters and his collaborator, Virginia Johnson, the groundbreaking researchers who sought to demystify arousal during the dark ages before the sexual revolution, in this new series based on Thomas Maiers biography Masters of Sex. He was a brilliant, obsessed and often imperious surgeon determined to make his name by decoding the physiology of pleasure. She was a former nightclub singer and sexually liberated woman with a desire for a career and a deft touch with people. Together they spent thousands of hours watching others masturbate and copulate while wired to monitors. They also had lots of sex with each other, though Johnson told Mr. Maier that at first she didnt want Masters  she wanted a job. Eventually, Masters left his wife to marry Johnson; they, too, later divorced. Though it takes liberties with facts and interpretation, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times, the show does an elegant job of reframing their strange, complicated and at times deeply cynical partnership into a twisted but intriguing love story. Its enjoyable, she said, mainly because the actors are so good. Michael Sheen (above, with Nicholle Tom), who is best known for playing likable charmers like Tony Blair and David Frost, is convincing as a driven and stilted egotist, a man who has compassion for patients and almost no time for his infertile, unhappy wife, Libby (Caitlin FitzGerald). As Virginia, a twice-divorced single mother of two, Lizzy Caplan (Party Down, Bachelorette) is dazzling in a role that isnt easy: Virginia is sensual and sexy, strong-willed and good-humored, a modern woman trying to forge her own way in a world that is still backward about sex and the role of women. And, like sex, Ms. Stanley added, Masters of Sex gets better as it goes on.",2013-09-29T15:49:25+0000
