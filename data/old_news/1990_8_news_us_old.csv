us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"KEEPING WATCH: A History of American Time. By Michael O'Malley. (Viking, $19.95.) In tracing the ways timekeeping has evolved in the United States, Michael O'Malley quotes Lewis Mumford's claim that ''the clock, not the steam engine, is the key machine of the modern industrial age.'' There were clocks in the American colonies as early as 1638; by 1700, roughly one white adult in 50 owned a clock and one in 32 a watch. But in a time when news took five days to travel from Philadelphia to New York, and another 10 to reach Boston, every city, town, village and even farm kept its own local time; as late as 1869, when the telegraph transmitted news of the final spike driven in the transcontinental railway, at 12:45 P.M. local time in Promontory, Utah, the time was 12:30 in Virginia City, Nev., 11:46 in San Francisco according to one newspaper and 11:44:37 according to another, and 2:47 in Washington. The railroads and Western Union are largely responsible for moving Americans to a national standard time; this shift, the author argues, drastically changed the way we think about ourselves and our society. Mr. O'Malley, who teaches American history at New York University, has a number of interesting things to say about the growth of clock and watch manufacturing in this country, about the evolution of standard time and the controversies over daylight time and, in his final chapter, he offers a new slant on the Scopes ''monkey trial'' of 1925. But the book too often reads more like a stack of note cards than a unified narrative. Well researched and thorough, ''Keeping Watch'' is a book with many interesting things in it, without at the same time being a very interesting book.",1990-08-05T05:00:00+0000

It worked so well he used it again - for a free meal in a trendy restaurant - and again and again to gain access to the homes of some wealthy and well-known New Yorkers.

Inspired by the success of the new play ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' which was in turn inspired by his misadventures, Mr. Hampton returned to New York to try acting again.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE BLACK WOMEN'S HEALTH BOOK: Speaking for Ourselves. Edited by Evelyn C. White. (Seal, Paper, $14.95.) Evelyn C. White has collected more than 40 poems, essays and personal memoirs in ''The Black Women's Health Book.'' Ms. White, a journalist at The San Francisco Chronicle, writes that ''over the past few years, I have observed a growing number of vibrant black women being devastated by a multitude of physical and emotional ailments, ranging from drug addiction to cancer.'' More than 50 percent of black women live in a state of emotional distress; most women with AIDS are black, and a black woman's chance of being murdered is three times higher than that of her white counterpart. Contributors, including the novelist Alice Walker, the social critic Angela Davis and the president of Planned Parenthood, Faye Wattleton, bring these statistics movingly to life. Though many of the topics - including diabetes, lupus, incest, cancer, alcoholism, AIDS, hypertension, sickle cell anemia and grief - are unavoidably depressing, the book also illustrates empowerment, hope and triumph. Some contributions, including a dry, academic piece on the history of black women physicians, do not measure up to the general quality of the writing. However, when the essays hit home, they hit hard. As Ms. White says: ''Painful though it may be, we must look at what ails us and how we can get better. . . . Please take this sisterly medicine and pass it on.''",1990-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,  Picture This,"Whether one can decipher a schedule quickly enough to catch a train or interpret a navigation chart in time to avoid treacherous rocks depends a great deal on how clearly hundreds of pieces of information - facts and statistics - are ordered and presented. In ENVISIONING INFORMATION (Graphics Press, Box 430, Cheshire, Conn. 06410, $48), Edward R. Tufte argues the crucial importance of good information design and gives advice on how to achieve it. Using hundreds of illustrations, from Galileo's 17th-century rendering of sunspots to a contemporary computer-generated illustration of garbage orbiting the earth, Mr. Tufte says that good design incorporates complex data into a simple, universally comprehensible system. For Mr. Tufte, who teaches statistics, graphic design and political economy at Yale University, the essential task of information design is to escape what he calls ''flatland,'' an impoverished two-dimensional region characterized by a limited perspective on insufficient data. He discusses various design techniques - layering, small multiples and use of color - and shows through examples which would be the best way to convey the life cycle of a Japanese beetle or a 24-hour cycle of pollution in Los Angeles. Mr. Tufte writes with a serious purpose: good design is a noble endeavor menaced by ''content-empty colorjunk'' and a ''swamp of perceptual shifts and other ambiguities.'' The book itself provides a model of good design - each beautifully printed page a harmony of space, type and illustration. The language, however, often subverts the author's plea for clarity. Phrases like ''enhancing the dimensionality and density of portrayals of information'' abound, revealing more a taste for density than a craving for lucidity.",1990-08-05T05:00:00+0000

The plant itself originated in the Andes, but the Incas found no use for it and left it for the Aztecs to cultivate and name; they called it tomatl. By 1523, the plant had found its way to Europe, where the Italians took to it enthusiastically. Perhaps for this reason, the English glumly feared the tomato as an aphrodisiac, and declared it poison.

Hence his academic foundation was not musical but literary, and his professional outlook was libertarian: ''For Poulenc composing was a game,'' wrote his fellow Frenchman, the composer and conductor Manuel Rosenthal. ''His music is very lively and amusing, running from one melody to the next. There is never any development - no 'grand architecture' as with Ravel.'' According to Rosenthal, Ravel himself admired Poulenc's ''ability to invent popular tunes,'' and the popular element - at least what we now discern retrospectively as a reflection of popular trends of the period - is often implied in much of Poulenc's work.",1990-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Co-founder and editor in chief of the irreverent Washington magazine that bears his name, Regardie has in the past 10 years managed to offend a lot of powerful people. Certainly he seems to have tried to offend them, town house to White House and everything in between. Regardie also managed - inevitably, one might say - to savage Washington's mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., maintaining among other things that his administration was bloated, venal, corrupt, incompetent and just plain stupid. It was a view that alienated many of the city's blacks and triggered a boycott of Regardie's. The publisher, who has been known to roller-skate to lunch at the Palm and wear shorts to board meetings, was unperturbed. Then, two years ago, he hired Pat Oliphant. ''I had wanted for a long time to have an outlet inside the Beltway,'' says Oliphant, the mild-looking cartoonist who has won virtually every award journalism has to offer, including the Pulitzer in 1967, but whose work, oddly, does not appear regularly in a newspaper in Washington, the town where he has lived and worked for the past 15 years.

Going by the collected wisdom of 1960's rock songs, summer is a time for surfing, romance, street-fighting or just getting gritty on the city streets. Songwriters seem not to have caught on yet, but in the last decade summer has also turned into a hot time for buying and selling rock-and-roll memorabilia. Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips usually hold their largest rock auctions in August or September in London. This year, Sotheby's has scheduled its sale for Aug. 21, and Phillips will hold its auction on Aug. 22. Christie's is devoting a Sept. 21 sale entirely to items related to ''Pink Floyd -The Wall,'' the 1982 Alan Parker film based on Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera. Some of the celluloids, concept drawings and pastels from the sale can be seen at Christie's East in New York, 219 East 67th Street, from Aug. 28 to Aug. 31, and at Christie's in Beverly Hills, 342 North Rodeo Drive, from Sept. 4 to Sept. 6.",1990-08-10T05:00:00+0000

Both sides in the controversy condsidered Him fully human and our fellow sufferer; the idea that he only appeared to be human was a characteristic of several other heretical groups, Gnostics, Apollinarians and Monophysites, each in their own way. The controversy in Arianism was about whether Jesus was fully God: was He the incarnation of the actual Creator of the universe, or was He a demigod created by the original God, and hence inferior to God in divinity? The Orthodox believed in Jesus' full divinity as well as His full humanity, a position Christians are supposed to take to this very day; the Arians saw Him as a divine intermediary, and thus believed in a God and a half. This did have great political implications, but it was not a matter of Arian equality vs. Orthodox hierarchy; absolute rulership and exclusion of the people was just an unfortunate trend of the times, which Theodoric shared in too, as much as he could.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Wohl, who was appointed by a Federal court in 1988 to oversee the Fulton Fish Market with an eye to curbing the racketeering that has long been rampant there, said in a report last week that an ''atmosphere of lawlessness'' persisted. Mr. Wohl said that a small group of people controlled the unloading of delivery trucks and charged such extortionate rates that it cost as much to move a pound of fish 50 feet at the market as to move it hundreds of miles from New England. Drivers who attempt to do their own unloading are ''subject to physical abuse,'' said the report. Mr. Wohl said he would promulgate new rules to end such goings on but blamed the existing mess at least in part on city government laxity. City Hall returned the aspersions. A spokesman said that the conditions cited in the report reflected Mr. Wohl's ''inability to correct the problem.''",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

That it doesn't quite come off - or that the most ambitious aspects of the exhibition come off the least - is no discredit to this museum's impressive reach.

Holograms, images created on flat surfaces by laser light that appear to be three-dimensional, are now frequently seen as decorative art, on credit cards among other things. Video hologram technology, when perfected, might offer architects the ability to draw a house on a computer screen and then examine its three-dimensional appearance or it could become the basis of three-dimensional television. Doctors might be able to use X-rays or other scanning devices to see organs in three dimensions. The M.I.T. researchers recently took a video image created on a computer screen using a program for a CAD, or computer assisted drawing, and converted it into a hologram. To do this, the computer drawing of a house, say, was first converted into computerized data that described a hologram of the three-dimensional object. This description was converted into electrical signals that altered and varied voltages on a piezo-electric crystal. This caused the crystal to send an ultrasonic wave through a tellurium oxide crystal. Laser light passing through the tellurium oxide crystal was altered so that it contained the holographic information.A system of moving mirrors synchronized with the computer signal were positioned so that the laser beam created a hologram of the image, the three-dimensional house, that appeared to a viewer to hover in front of the lens.

This covers the antique sarcophagus in which the poet's remains were originally interred in the old portico of the church of San Francesco. An exile from Florence, Dante found refuge with the Da Polenta family of Ravenna in 1317 and spent his last years with them, finishing ''The Divine Comedy.''

Traveling the Santa Fe Trail from Kansas City to Santa Fe is addictive, hallucinogenic, for without the forgotten fears of Indian attack or thirst or childbirth to dispel the boredom, finding the historical remains of the trail in the empty prairies becomes a desperate necessity.

The greatest influence on modern American film making is not Ingmar Bergman, not John Ford, not even Alfred Hitchcock, but the man responsible for such efforts as ''She Gods of Shark Reef'' and ''Humanoids From the Deep.'' Roger Corman, the king of the exploitation movie, the Pope of Pop Cinema, has guided the careers of many of the most talented people in Hollywood today - among others, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, Jonathan Kaplan, John Sayles. Several of them have provided testimonials or reminiscences that are interspersed throughout Mr. Corman's autobiography, ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime,'' written with the journalist Jim Jerome. Jonathan Demme's is typical: ''Roger is arguably the greatest independent filmmaker the American film industry has ever seen and will probably ever see. . . . His contribution to motion pictures has been absolutely awesome.'' As this memoir makes clear, Mr. Corman, as both a director and a producer, taught not only craft and technique but also clarity of thought and, above all, economy of means. Working on incredibly tight budgets, he never had the time to become self-conscious or pretentious. The first ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' probably his most famous film, was shot in two days, and some of the funniest stories in this book concern the ways he went about cutting costs on his more than 200 productions. (When all else failed, he would shoot a scene in the dark so the audience could not see what was actually going on.) The stories do pall after a while. One grows weary of learning about all the films that were milestones for him; there is probably more pace and variation in ''Attack of the Crab Monsters.'' Nonetheless, Mr. Corman comes across as likable, admirable and, in his ability to survive in Hollywood with his integrity intact, even awe-inspiring.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE HOME GIRLS. By Olga Masters. (Norton, $18.95.) The women in Olga Masters' stories do not triumph. They rarely smile and are often mean. Most simply endure. Yet they are powerful, somehow positive characters. Like most of the works of Masters, an Australian who died in 1986, the stories in ''The Home Girls'' tell of poverty, sadness, dreams and lost opportunities, often seen through the eyes of children forced to grow up too soon or women bowed by a relentlessly patriarchal society. In ''The Sea on a Sunday,'' the Went children, too poor to do anything else, spend their Sundays watching the cars heading for the beach, 15 miles away. Their mother pretends she is interested only for their sake and their father pretends no one deserves to go anyway. In ''Passenger to Berrigo,'' Sylvia McMahon, determined to prove she is better than her mother, returns from Sydney, a successful heroine to her siblings but a self-aggrandizing child to her parents. ''Only a maid,'' her mother says to herself, smugly satisfied when she learns her daughter's true occupation. ''A housemaid. No better than me after all.'' Masters' starkly simple writing tastes of the grit of Depression-era Australian farms, where the sun beats down on people instead of gently warming them. ''The Home Girls,'' like Masters' later collection, ''A Long Time Dying'' - in which the same characters appear in circumstance, if not in name - is not light reading, but it is enlightening.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

However, it is similarity that interests me today, not difference. While they may not jump out, some underlying resemblances can be discerned between the two operas. One close thematic relationship, which may be no news to you, struck me recently when I attended performances of these seemingly unrelated works within a few days of one another: ''War and Peace'' at the Seattle Opera and ''Cosi'' at the Santa Fe Opera.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THAT PLACE IN MINNESOTA: Changing Lives, Saving Lives. By Ed Fitzgerald. (Viking, $18.95.) Take an executive at the pinnacle of his profession in an industry that associates creativity with alcohol. Mix in an exhilarating career full of deals sealed at three-martini lunches. Add forced retirement at the age of 65 and you have created circumstances, at least for Ed Fitzgerald, as explosive as a Molotov cocktail. Mr. Fitzgerald, the former chief executive officer of the Book-of-the-Month Club and author of ''A Nickel an Inch,'' describes in ''That Place in Minnesota'' his month at St. Mary's Rehabilitation Center, a Minneapolis facility for substance abusers. His writing style - wry, engaging, and direct - conveys his intention to disclose intimate experiences and emotions. In many instances, he succeeds. Particularly effective are scenes in group therapy, led by a counselor, Debbie Chapman, who asks the questions her patients most dread. Mr. Fitzgerald vividly portrays two close friends in the group: Denny, a young businessman from Texas who received cocaine in his hometown via Federal Express, and Mac, a Presbyterian minister from Vermont who embraced alcohol after his wife's death. The writer's distaste for the spiritual philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous provides an interesting counterpoint to the religious undertone of his treatment. What is missing, then, from this heartfelt account? Even though Mr. Fitzgerald reveals severe, alcohol-induced problems with a wife he adores, even though he recalls a few hours spent in jail on a drunken driving charge, he devotes many more pages to others at the center than to his own struggle. His interesting but partial self-portrait leaves the reader wanting more. Was his addiction really broken, for example, in 28 days? ''That Place in Minnesota'' depicts a painful time in the life of an ''intensely private'' man who admits, ''I'd rather be alone with my troubles if I can't choose the people I want to talk to about them.'' Within those limitations, this is a moving and courageous memoir.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

Oscar Peterson is ''a virtuoso without peer'' whose immense talents have earned him 10 honorary degrees and the Order of Canada. Gene Lees, the former editor of Down Beat magazine and the author of ''Singers and the Song,'' has written an enthusiastic journalistic account of a musician's development as the thinking person's pianist. Mr. Peterson, who was born in Montreal in 1925, credits his father, a Pullman porter, as his greatest musical influence. Mr. Peterson's big break came in 1949 when he played Carnegie Hall, thereby cementing a relationship with the influential jazz impresario Norman Granz. In the 1950's, his trio (with the bassist Ray Brown and the guitarist Herb Ellis) enjoyed great critical and popular success. Mr. Lees consistently defends the pianist, who by his very virtuosity has inspired some sour criticism. ''Oscar Peterson must be considered more than an influence,'' Mr. Lees writes.

In the past, most traders would have expected the dollar to move much higher because it was considered a safe haven. But at the end of last week, the dollar was only a quarter of a pfennig stronger against the German mark than it had been before the Aug. 2 invasion. It rose a little more against the French franc but weakened against the British pound and the Swiss franc. The dollar's only area of real strength, as in past weeks, was against the yen.

us,  Present at the Commission,"Time and the seven-figure auction prices have proven them right, these men and women who first collected and commissioned Impressionist art. Their taste has meant enough to history and the marketplace to warrant several books. IMPRESSIONISM: The First Collectors (Abrams, $75), however, isn't one of them. Anne Distel, a curator at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, has produced a series of sketches so obedient to the first law of biography - tell them what it cost - they read more like appraisers' notes than art history. There are a few delightful details: the novelist Edmond de Goncourt takes a swipe at Charles Ephrussi (one of the models for Marcel Proust's Swann). The textile dealer Ernest Hoschede puts together one of the best collections of his time, then loses his fortune to his creditors and his wife to Claude Monet. The millionaire Louisine Havemeyer, who later donated more than 50 Impressionist paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is arrested and jailed after a suffragist protest, which horrifies her respectable friend Mary Cassatt. If you want more than tidbits, however - if you need a narrative thread to tie things together - you had better look somewhere else. Ms. Distel has not produced a study of the early collectors and dealers of Impressionist art; she has tossed off rough sketches of them. By rights, even these, together with plates of paintings by Manet, Renoir and the other Impressionists, should hold your attention - haven't you wondered, after all, about all those patrons whose faces now stare into yours in museums? But read more than one sketch at a time, and your curiosity will die an untimely death. Ms. Distel appears oblivious to the simplest rules of biography; she ignores questions like: why did they collect art? and lingers, instead, on the vagaries of price. The book's problems are exacerbated by Barbara Perroud-Benson's translation; it's full of French syntax that sounds silly in English.",1990-08-12T05:00:00+0000

For the Yankees, a promising start to its trip through the West - a three-game sweep of the Mariners in Seattle - became a distant memory.",1990-08-17T05:00:00+0000

If the slab has not changed from its tilted position for many years, don't bother fixing it. But if it has shifted within the last year or two, try to trace the cause - usually poor drainage - and remedy it before leveling the slab.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME: Generosity and Self-Interest Among the Philanthropic Elite. By Teresa Odendahl. (Basic, $22.95.) Who questions the motivations of generous donors to universities, museums, hospitals or any of the 950,000 nonprofit organizations competing for charitable contributions? Certainly not the supplicants, and there have been few scholarly critical analyses of this aspect of philanthropy. Now along comes Teresa Odendahl, an anthropologist, with a provocative book based primarily on 140 interviews with philanthropists, but also on 10 years' experience in the grant-making field. What Ms. Odendahl finds is that the affluent give mainly to preserve elitist institutions that provide pleasure or comfort for the wealthy. She supports her conclusion with copious quotations from the benefactors that reflect the self-interest, the gratification and sometimes the sense of power they achieve as philanthropists. The author's personal convictions are clear. ''Elite American philanthropy serves the interests of the rich to a greater extent than it does the interests of the poor, disadvantaged, or disabled,'' she writes. Perhaps there was too much selectivity in Ms. Odendahl's subjects; maybe the altruistic donors were hiding out on interview days. Some fund-givers and fund-seekers will argue that gifts to support cultural centers, medical research and education help the general public, not just the privileged. Others will take the position that how a donor directs charity is an individual right. Opening up a debate on this murky, little-studied aspect of charitable giving should be beneficial. But there also is a concern that lawmakers intent on trimming budget deficits and increasing tax revenues will seize on the image of the indulgent, self-serving rich to buttress their demand for reducing the charitable deduction.",1990-08-19T05:00:00+0000

At the Louvre, there is a fascinating re-creation of a work put together in 1945 to show the world that Paris's couturiers and artisans had not gone down the drain during World War II. Titled the ''Theatre de la Mode,'' it is a series of elegant Parisian settings populated with 228 doll-size wire mannequins in couturier styles of the time (top). Included are photographs of Parisians during and just after the Occupation. The plucky styles, some presaging the ''New Look'' of 1947, seem tantalizingly different. Using 2,000 pairs of gloves from its archives, the Hermes boutique has put together an inventive show titled ''Le Gant Elegant'' (one example, insert). Gloves, many mechanized, read books, make love, go strolling, play musical instruments, march in parades and swim in fish tanks. Highly entertaining, the exhibit also points up the creativity that Paris artisans lavish on every article of feminine attire. For one week, the house of Chanel re-created a suite at the Ritz where Coco Chanel lived during the 1930's (Chanel, below). The purpose was to publicize its new watch collection. To visit these rooms so redolent of Chanel's aura - ''It's as if she just left a cigarette smoldering in a crystal ashtray,'' said one visitor - was to leave with a longing for this luxe era.",1990-08-19T05:00:00+0000

I watched our shadow moving below, moving fast. The tops of the trees were mauve, like cauliflower. Then for vast stretches the jungle disappeared. It had been scalped. Slash and burn. Long trees lay every which way on their sides, and amid them, beside them, grew the new coca bushes. The trees were like giant straws strewn over the ground out of a box.",1990-08-19T05:00:00+0000

When the Zuni Indians of New Mexico, feeling the strong tug of old beliefs, began in recent years to seek the aid of ancient war gods - whose appeal is not limited to wartime - they had to rescue dozens of the carved wooden statues from museums and private collectors. As a result, among the various Indian tribes that have fought to regain possession of cultural artifacts, the Zunis have become experts on getting the job done. The tribe has recovered 38 of the striking, starkly sculpted cylinders in recent years and is negotiating now for 13 more that are in the hands of the Brooklyn Museum. Barton Martza, head councilman of the Zuni, said that the tribe retrieved most of its war gods by simply explaining that the communally carved statues were tribal property that no individual Zuni could legally sell - they fetch up to $40,000 each - or even give away. Furthermore, ritual requires that the idols be left exposed to the elements until they disintegrate. ''We really don't get into the legal stuff very much,'' he said.

Yields on certificates of deposit have been falling for more than three months, but the Middle East situation could mean higher yields in the near future. Bank rate analysts suggest watching rates on certificates of deposit closely for the next three weeks and holding some money in a federally insured bank money market account to be ready to shift to C.D.'s if interest rates rise. Investors might also want to split money between short-term certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Here are some current national average yields on certificates of deposit and the comparable yields in early May. $ Maturity Current Yield Yield on May 9 Money market account 6.08% 6.23% Six months 7.71% 8.01% One year 7.86% 8.08% 2 1/2 years 7.93% 8.20% 5 years 8.04% 8.24%",1990-08-25T05:00:00+0000

The Mexican journalist Angeles Mastretta's debut novel is part of Latin America's literature of political repression: in ''Mexican Bolero,'' a young girl loses her innocence while corrupt politicians, generals, labor leaders and peasant bosses jockey for power in the years after the Mexican Revolution of 1911. This spare, seamlessly translated book, originally published in Spanish in 1986, realistically portrays how people are bent by and eventually defy the evil that surrounds them. In a tone of cynical irony, Catalina Guzman, who is just 14 when she begins her narration, tells of her deflowering by Gen. Andres Ascencio, who is twice her age. After they marry and settle in her home state of Puebla, Cati watches, horrified, as her ambitious, amoral husband rises from local army supervisor to iron-fisted governor, robbing families of their property and arranging for his critics to be killed. Helplessly, she assists him with his official duties and raises their children. But his unfaithfulness infuriates her and she eventually sabotages him, with surprising results. Like Ms. Mastretta, Cati is a reporter, and her strength as a narrator lies in her understated descriptions of Mexico's social ills, which are suffused with mockery of ruling-class hypocrisy. (After the general places her in charge of Puebla's public welfare projects, she quips, ''For a while, I hadn't time to think about the mad, the sick and the orphaned, I was so busy organizing parties. In the end I think we even forgot what they were in aid of.'') Unfortunately, Ms. Mastretta sometimes seems to forget her own obligations to her readers; too often, for example, she states rather than shows the reasons for the townspeople's ignorance and apathy. Nevertheless, ''Mexican Bolero'' offers a revealing portrait of Mexico in the 1920's and 30's, an era largely unknown to most Americans.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000

He had been condemned after admitting he killed a 77-year-old man during an attempted robbery that had been suggested by the victim's nephew, who was not charged.

Now there is a way to directly convert these electronic images into high-quality, instant, black and white photographs printed on film. The new device (left), developed by the Polaroid Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., uses a specially designed laser printer that takes the video image, converts it into laser light and uses that light to expose sheets of photographic film.

us,  Living Ruins,"In VISIONS OF ANCIENT AMERICA (Rizzoli, $50), the photographer Roberto Schezen turns his lens on archeological sites in Mexico and Central America. The cities he records were built by Aztecs, Toltecs, Olmecs and Mayans, but it is nearly impossible to imagine human creatures living amid these desolate twilight landscapes. The ruins seem to have been set down directly out of angry skies by brutal but dazzling gods; they could be inhabited only by the jungle demons that snarl from the facades, or by hollow-eyed and solitary stone giants like those carved at Tula, north of Mexico City. The choice of a stark and coarse-grained black-and-white format is startling and paradoxical. Many of the actual sites are half-consumed by humid, emerald jungle, but the terrain of ''Visions of Ancient America'' has the luminous and cold-shadowed texture of a lunar surface. Mr. Schezen's photographs reveal three main levels of compositional interest: on the smallest scale, the tantalizingly elusive patterns formed by masses of repeated three-dimensional shapes, often of stylized plant and animal form; the almost miraculous resolution of that intricate tangle into the large and simple geometries that form the individual monuments, and, finally, the numinous symbiosis of architecture, sky and horizon. The mode of presentation - site by site, with diagrams and thumbnail historical sketches - seems to be a sly wink at those collections of photographs of classical Roman ruins that exude a mysterious drama despite the scholarly intentions of their authors. Mr. Schezen, who lives and works in Milan, is surely familiar with that tradition, but his purpose is far from scientific. Even the names of those forlorn cities - Sayil, Tikal, Uxmal, Yaxchilan, Teotihuacan - echo the photographs' haunting esthetic, which like the architecture itself is shockingly alien to the Western classical tradition.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Just how the Soviet Union will emerge from the tumultuous events that are still shaking that country is still anybody's guess. But ''Chronicle of a Revolution,'' a collection of highly readable, provocative essays edited by Abraham Brumberg, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, suggests that most of the changes that have swept across the country over the past five years were predictable. The authors, who include Soviet and Western scholars, argue that a conscious, if cautious, search for alternative economic and political structures began shortly after Stalin's death. In the Khrushchev era, economists and other academicians conducted more adventurous dialogues and experiments, which in time attracted wider attention and eventually extended to international relations and foreign policy questions. Even during Brezhnev's counterreformation, some observers saw advances in human rights and legal reform. The pace of these changes was slow; reforms encountered widespread resistance.

The Review also criticized others, but its attacks on Dr. Cole were particularly harsh. Supporters of Dr. Cole, who is black, accused the newspaper of racial bias. The professor did not mention the publication in his letter of resignation, but referred to a ''series of events that began in 1983'' - the year he first clashed with the Review. He said that his departure might lead some to conclude that his critics ''have won a major victory,'' but he was simply weary of wrestling with the problem. Editors of the Review denied any motivation but the pursuit of academic excellence.

Over the thumping beat of house music, which currently reigns in urban clubs, Blaze's songs proclaim hope and self-affirmation, insisting ''Problems always work themselves out'' and ''Keep on reaching and keep on striving.'' Blaze aims to do for house music what Earth, Wind and Fire did for disco, mixing faith and cultural pride with the latest dance beat. The group, dressed in African robes, was unceasingly positive; in Thursday's first set, the members brought their parents onstage for hugs. The three-man vocal group from Newark takes some pointers from 1970's soul.

The trail is indistinct but there's enough light to be aware of the elevation and the infinite black space that is not rock. Stars fill the sky and city lights map out the abode of mortals down below. The flashlights of fellow climbers ascend in a bizarre procession. No matter how you try to outwit the crowds, you never walk alone in Japan. Unbelievably, climbing Mount Fuji at night is not some deviation only gaijin (foreigners) are crazy enough to perform. It's a Japanese tradition to watch sunrise from the volcano, and in summer inspired pilgrims hike the mountain at all hours.

New York - arguably the style capital of the world - is the setting for the English writer Neil Ferguson's ambitious first novel, which turns out to be sometimes promising and brilliant yet often exasperating. In ''Putting Out,'' Mr. Ferguson has taken on a formidable and intriguing topic, the rough and tumble of a New York mayoral campaign complicated by terrorism and murder in the garment district. A bonfire couldn't contain the vanity of these characters: Max Faraday, a style-conscious police detective who dabbles in semiotics; Delia Summers, a calculating scientist with a passion for insects; and Tina Rauch and Rocco Da Silva, the clotheshorse candidates. ''Putting Out'' aspires to be a satire on New York life, an excoriation of modern mores in the tradition of Evelyn Waugh and Tom Wolfe. Mr. Ferguson occasionally reveals a sharp, savage eye for the habits and proclivities of New Yorkers, but it's hard to hear the real voices of the city in his pages. His New Yorkers talk like Oxbridge dons and his characters' vocabulary owes more to Fleet Street than Flatbush. There's the suspicion that Mr. Ferguson did his research from afar: he's got the physical landmarks nailed down, but the ambiance, the feel of the city just isn't here. Like the wardrobe fixtures it often describes, ''Putting Out'' has the problems of many a failed fashion: the design is provocative, but the execution leaves much to be desired.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Their singular voices filled movie theaters just as their images filled the screens. Idiosyncratic, unmistakable, the sounds they made took up residence in our synapses.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"''YOU GOTTA HAVE HEART.'' By Richard Adler with Lee Davis. (Donald I. Fine, $21.95.) ''Hernando's Hideaway,'' ''Hey There,'' ''Steam Heat,'' ''Heart,'' ''Whatever Lola Wants'' - for such songs from his first two shows, ''The Pajama Game'' and ''Damn Yankees,'' which opened on Broadway within a year of each other in the mid-1950's, Richard Adler remains one of the more beloved names in American musical comedy. In his autobiography, '' 'You Gotta Have Heart','' written with the music historian Lee David, Mr. Adler says that he never recovered from the death of his songwriting collaborator, Jerry Ross, only months after ''Damn Yankees'' opened in 1955. ''Eighteen short months, and the memory of them would have to do me for a lifetime,'' writes Mr. Adler. With only intermittent success writing commercial jingles and Government-sponsored symphonies, his career has languished ever since, and the peripatetic account it receives here tends to hover on one ''doomed musical venture'' after the other. With occasional comments on the various theatrical personalities involved, '' 'You Gotta Have Heart' '' tells of a Broadway that is no more. Mr. Adler's details of what went right with his two hits - and what went wrong with just about everything else - can be both enlightening and amusing. Some of the best stories entail his coordinating Presidential galas at John F. Kennedy's request, including the memorable birthday celebration for Kennedy at Madison Square Garden that featured Marilyn Monroe. However, Mr. Adler's memoir is perhaps sincere to a fault, as his cosmic advice proves heady going for anyone who has not become, as he has, a proselytizing convert of the karmic philosophy of Shirley MacLaine. Though metaphysics may have provided Mr. Adler with the relief he sought for a bumpy career and for the death of his son Christopher, the relevant issues of his book are obfuscated rather than clarified by his philosophy. It makes for sappy reading.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Then, last Thursday, it fell to a low against the Swiss franc, 1.2560, and set another low aganst the mark, 1.5444. At the same time, the weary dollar fell further against the three popular high-yield currencies that are backed by high interest rates and are also net energy exporters, making them less vulnerable to the Persian Gulf crisis. On Thursday, the pound jumped three cents to $1.9555; the Australian dollar rose to 83.52 cents. And the dollar fell to a 12-year low against the Canadian dollar of 1.1293. The dollar got a little lift from tension in the Middle East on Friday, as the Iraqis surrounded foreign embassies in Kuwait City. ",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"HARD CITY. By Clark Howard. (Dutton, $21.95.) Clark Howard's autobiographical novel is set in the slums of Chicago's West Side in the 1950's. Its hero, Richie, is a 12-year-old who escapes from a succession of malignant foster homes, as well as his heroin-ridden mother, to strike out on his own. While polishing his talents as a petty thief, he manages to eke out an existence by working in a bowling alley, where he secretly holes up at night. When his mother dies, Richie is sent to a sadistic correctional institution for juveniles, then later is released to his maternal grandmother, who lives in a small town in Tennessee, where he is ostracized not only for being the son of a convict but also because he's a Yankee. Two factors sustain Richie: the hope of finding his father, who disappeared after his release from prison, and a passion for books. Although there are no surprises in Mr. Howard's 19th novel, it sustains a sense of tension, moving smoothly between flashbacks of the events of Richie's early years and the traumatic experiences of his adolescence, then on to his return to Chicago and his emergence as a young man in control of his life.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000
us,The Essential Chatham,"Like other towns much visited by tourists, Chatham, Mass., reveals its many faces only to those who take time to look below the surface. To casual travelers who leave their cars in the public parking lot after surviving the summer traffic jam, a stroll along its gently curving Main Street with elegant low-key shops, restaurants and inns unobtrusively tucked into sea captains' houses, conjures up the picture of Olde New England charm, even when T-shirts are being sold. To several thousand weekenders and weekly renters, a good part of Chatham's attraction probably results from its great variety of fine sandy public beaches on ocean, bay, sound or glacial pond. The same sparkling waters provide recreation and challenge to the summer sailor and sports fisherman.",1990-08-26T05:00:00+0000
