The ending is the death of Rosie Pepperell's young husband, which pitches his widow into the slough of a depression. M. M. Constantin is very good at reconstituting the workaday world of a college teacher of dramatic lit (which Rosie is), seen through a film of grief. A raw sense of love decreases the heroine's patience with the asininity that is a corollary of her profession. The author follows the teacher through a sabbatical in Los Angeles, where she tries to sort herself out with the aid of a psychiatrist and tries also to pursue a research project. This involves a famous leftwing playwright, whose private papers are interred at U.C.L.A. along with a sad secret or two. As work, time and maybe the shrink begin to clear Rosie's head, she sees more clearly the two lovers who bless her singleness. She responds to this surfeit of riches after passing through a couple of emotional decompression chambers that Mrs. Constantin depicts beautifully.",1975-01-05T05:00:00+0000

Moreover, vast numbers of people have little choice about experiencing their own dying, since they die in hospitals, too drugged to participate in their own final moments. Our culture encourages us to hide our own fear, curiosity, anger, grief, helplessness or excitement at the prospect of death, as if these normal feelings were somehow shameful.

It's an atmospheric period piece, a sort of French Summer of 42 except it's summer of 37 and very aristocratic, languid and sunny on the Basque coast, with little rumblings of external trouble (the Spanish Civil War) and internal decay (the gradually revealed alcoholism and gambling of dashing young Uncle Boy) sensed behind the pretty painted scenes. In other words, a novel of the last innocent summer. It's told from the alternating points of view of a precocious girlchildd and a sensual Basque servant girl, both of whom are, in their very different ways, smitten with Boy. Twelve  year  old Hildegarde, the daughter of the Malgasse family, regards Boyher mother's younger brotheras a special ally, playmate and gallant; Suzon the maid has been at his sexual beck and call every summer for years. But this is the summer when Boy reveals his decadent is not quite the right worddissolute qualities; Hildegarde must eventually see her hero falling down drunk and gambling  broke, and Suzon gradually turns toward a man of her own kind, strong and clean and simple and healthy. The denouement is tragic and fixes Boy in nostalgia forever, the incarnation of innocence lost. ",1975-01-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Brother of Wind':About Wildlife in the Canadian Rockies,"""Brother of the Wind,"" which opened at four Manhattan theaters yesterday, is perfect escapist entertainment for those aminal-loving, city-bound children who count themselves lucky if they can own a hamster. It's about wildlife in the Canadian Rockies, particularly about the growing pains of four timber-wolf puppies that are raised (and then returned to the forest) by Sam Monroe (Dick Robinson), a fine, stanch, white-bearded mountain man who looks a good deal the way Santa Claus might if he got more exercise.Mr. Robinson, who directed and co-produced the movie, is the only character in a film that is concerned with introducing us to nature's various systems of checks and balances. The film's style is direct, simple, often beautiful and mostly free of the sort of anamorphosizing clichs that one usually finds in such movies.The wolves share the camera's attention with, among other things, deer, bear (black, grizzly), salmon (going upstream), coyote, elk, weasel, muskrat, duck, mountain lion and raccoon. The animals are terrific, the landscapes spectacular and the photography first-rate. More important is the way that ""Brother of the Wind"" demonstrates the survival-of-the-fittest law with such gentle tact.Leon Ames provides the soundtrack narration that is meant to be the old man's musing monologue.4 Abstract Shorts""Color Sound Frames,"" the collective title of this week's film program at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is devoted to the ""flicker-film"" explorations of Paul Sharits. The program is composed of four short abstract films, beginning with ""Ray Gun Virus"" (14 minutes), made in 1966, and concluding with ""Color Sound Frames"" (20 minutes), made last year.

Writers, being human, are not in a position to choose their monuments. This one is more Audenesque than Auden, hardly fitting as the final words, the summing up of a man who set his mark on an age. As he developed into a superb writer, he became something more: an intellectual and moral touchstone for three generations of Englishmen and Americans. None of the obvious sources, as a leftist of the thirties, as a High Church Anglican of the sixties or even the work itselfquite account for it. History and genius worked in magical combination: Auden was in Spain in 1937, in China in 1938, in Germany in 1945. He was, after Pound and Eliot, the only international poet of the English language.

Wells: The first contact between the human race and a race of intelligent aliens. The two authors have impressive credentials: Niven won a Hugo Award in 1970 for his novel Ringworld, and Poumelle worked in the U. S. space program and, according to the book jacket, holds degrees in engineering, psychology, and political science. Yet 20 pages into their novel, I found myself asking, with the congenital uneasiness of all reviewers, Could this be a puton? Five hundred pages later, I reluctantly concluded that it was not.

us,'Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain',"""Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain,"" the documentary being shown through Tuesday in the New American Filmmakers Series at the Whitney Museum of American Art, generates a narrative excitement that is not often found in nonfiction films given to exploration of issues.This is the story of a small group of Western Shoshone Indians who live in Nevada's Battle Mountain Indian Colony. Unlike most of their neighboring fellow Indians, they are traditionalists, people who want to retain their culture and their lands. The land in question consists of 24 million acres, about one third of Nevada, and they contend that the treaty they concluded with the United States in 1863 did not make any concessions to the nation that had come upon them.They have refused compensation and are threatened by Government policy, which permits thousands of trees on the land to be torn down, trees that the tribe's religion regards as sacred and that also provide food.Joel L. Freedman, producer and director of this 70-minute color film, spent two years making it. He has told it as a story of a small, menaced people, depicting their way of life, their problems, their humor, their aspirations, much of it in their own words, although Robert Redford narrates the script by Tom Schachtman.Chuck Levey's photography dramatically focuses on faces and foliage, following the Indians from the quiet of their colony to a dramatic climax in the Indians' confrontation with the Indian Claims Commission and depicting the relentless uprooting of the trees by a huge chain pulled between two tractors.""Broken Treaty at Battle Mountain"" has much to say to anyone who is concerned with big against small, with preservation against ""progress"" and it says it well. The story does not end with the film. These Western Shoshones are still in litigation and seeking public support; the film should go a long way toward finding it.

us,Screen: 'Macon County Line' Arrives,"When a movie like ""Macon County Line"" comes into town nine months after it has opened elsewhere in the country, having already earned more than $8-million, the primary impulse is to ask why. What does it mean?""Macon County Line,"" which arrived at neighborhood theaters yesterday, apparently means that rural melodramathe kind that realizes our worst nightmaresis still sure-fire box office if it is vivid and violent enough and if it's pitched at a mentality that finds road-sign reading an intellectual labor.Like Phil Karlson's ""Walking Tall,"" another national phenomenon, ""Macon County Line"" is set in the back-country American South, a region that is becoming as essential to a certain kind of pop American melodrama as Transylvania is to the vampire movie.In these melodramas, the rural South is a place of unrelieved bigotry, cruelty and violence. Travelers from other parts of the country either are crooks who teach the natives new ways to misbehave or they are innocents, like those in ""Easy Rider,"" who wander too close to the edge of the civilized world and fall off it. It was one of the few credits to ""Billy Jack,"" set in the Southwest, that it showed the South to have no corner on evil.Also like ""Walking Tall,"" based on the life of Buford Pusser, the late Tennessee sheriff, ""Macon County Line"" is said to be a fictionalized account of something that actually happened. There, however, the similarity ends. Mr. Karlson is a talented, canny director who knows his medium. Richard Compton, who directed ""Macon County Line,"" has studied the medium but he doesn't seem to trust it. After the first 30 minutes, there isn't a scene or a revelation that the director (and co-author) hasn't so laboriously set up that a bright 10-year-old couldn't predict all the subsequent events.That, of course, could be one reason why the movie has proved so popular. It affirms our belief in our own witless superiority.The screenplay was written by Mr. Compton and Max Baer (late of ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), who also produced the film and very creditably acts a leading role. As Deputy Reed Morgan, Mr. Baer plays a beefy, bigoted sheriff whose Confederate sympathies (he wears a small rebel flag on his sleeve) are somehow made to seem responsible for the griefstricken rampage that highlights the film.The story, placed in the mid-nineteen-fifties, concerns two young men from Chicago, brothers about to be inducted in the Army who, in the course of a final spree across the country, are mistaken for a pair of murderous psychotics. That's all there is: vagrant viciousness and coincidence. It's about nothing more than casual error.Yet the film is not without its moments of primitive fascination, which result, I suspect, from the spectacle of watching innocent people hopelessly if arbitrarily trapped.""Macon County Line"" also benefits from its performances by the professionals who play the leads, including Mr. Baer, and by the nonpros who play the supporting roles, random country folk, characters like waitresses and filling-station attendants whose awkwardnesses carry peculiar conviction.Alan Vint and Jesse Vint, brothers in real life, display an easy, intelligent self-assurance as the ill-fated tourists from Chicago, and Cheryl Waters is surprisingly affecting as the good-hearted bar girl who has the misfortune to be picked up by the brothers. The written roles seem merely outlines for characters, but these three young performers gives them individual and identifiable substance.",1975-01-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Nicholas Ray Subject of 'Stranger Myself',"Jean-Luc Godard called him the camera. An admiring student describes him as a con artist. He himself says that when he read the laudatory analyses of his work by French film critics he didn't know who they were talking about. He is Nicholas Ray, the fine, often troubled film director who is the subject of the feature-length documentary ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself,"" which will be shown at the First Avenue Screening Room at noon and midnight today and tomorrow.The film is a fascinating footnote to contemporary motion picture history. It's too affectionate to be critically definitive, but it captures a lot of the contradictions in the life and career of this man who manages to seem most elegant and ascetic when he most needs a shave and a fresh cigarette, who is simultaneously old and young, totally sincere and just occasionally full of bananas.Mr. Ray may well be his own most complex, riveting hero. He's a romantic with a fiercely realistic view of things.After a solid apprenticeship in the New York theater, Mr. Ray moved to Hollywood in the nineteen-forties, managing to make several classics (""In a Lonely Place,"" ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Johnny Guitar"") while playing the role of one of the town's most dependable contract directors. He then more or less disappeared in the sixties, his fortunes declining and falling with a couple of big-budget made-in-Spain blockbusters (""King of Kings,"" ""55 Days at Peking"").""I'm a Stranger Here Myself,"" which he describes as the working title of every project he's ever worked on, examines Mr. Ray and his career from the vantage point of the two-year hitch (1972-1973) he put in teaching at Harpur College at the State University of New York at Binghamton. Intercut with sequences showing Mr. Ray directing his students in the production of an ambitious experimental feature are interviews with John Houseman (identified by the director as one of the two most important influences on his career, the other being Elia Kazan), Natalie Wood (who co-starred in ""Rebel Without a Cause"") and Franois Truffaut, who eloquently describes his admiration for ""Johnny Guitar.""The film also makes use of clips from various Ray films ""Johnny Guitar,"" ""Rebel without a Cause,"" ""In a Lonely Place,"" ""They Live by Night"") to back up these points, and though the clips are fairly extensive, they have a way of undercutting the things said. Snippets from movies, even good ones, are seldom substantial enough to carry the weight of this sort of analysis.Most fascinating and moving are the Binghamton sequences:the director badgering his leading lady for being late to a wintry midnight location (she has a round, pretty unfinished face and an unfinished star's temper), theorizing about acting, recalling some of the great names he has worked with, pausing in a frozen half-crouch as he studies the set-up for a shot, pretending with all his heart to be making the next great Ray film. That's not meant to be pejorative. Pretense, illusion and monumental self-assurance are part of the drive of genius.Howard da Silva provides the mostly straightforward narration for the film, which was made by two talented young men named David Helpern Jr. (director) and James C. Gutman (producer). Auston de Besche was director of photography. They are up to the demands of their subject who, at 63 years old, is still one of the most irascible, original men making movies.",1975-01-17T05:00:00+0000

us,The British Poetries,"British poetry today is, sometimes amusingly, threatening to get out of hand. The spasms that have convulsed Western art in the wake of modern history are affecting British poetry too. A postBlack Mountain school now exists, represented most recently in the books put out by Stuart Montgomery's Fulcrum Press and in the avantgarde magazine Poetry Review, edited by Eric Mottrarm. A list of germinative names sent me in 1972 by Mottram suggests the Americanoriented, postmodernist nature of his interests: Cage, Cunningham, Olson, Duncan, Zukofsky, Ginsberg, Jones (Berate), a number of black poets, Ashbery, Elliott Carter, M. C. Richards, Fuller, the Gestalt therapists, Brakhage, McClure, Pynchon, Burroughs, Mailer, Goodman, Halprin, Chomsky, and so on. Of course, the new movements are not merely derivative. For instance, though Montgomery and Mottram have encouraged the young poet Tom Pickard, it is in part because he brings Northumbrian workingclass attitudes and speech into his poetry so freshly and originally. And a poet like Jeff Nuttall thrives in the new atmosphere because of his wild imagination and satirical joy and hectic realism. At the same time, among England's most accomplished poets, certain individual voices such as Peter Redgrove's and Ted Hughes's can be heard to have a vigor beyond that of the prevailing tone of quietly controlled feeling still dominating English verse.",1975-01-19T05:00:00+0000

us,If You Go ,"to Davos in the second half of March or in April, you'll find that hotel prices are down from highseason rates and that many packages, including hotels, meals, lift tickets and lessons, are from 20 to 30 per cent cheaper. Remember, though, that the Easter weekend (at the end of March this year) is a busy time, and reduced rates won't apply then. Like the mountains themselves, the accommodations offer a wide choice. They range from firstclass hotels, with three full meals in the highest Swiss tradition, for $50$60 a day to pensions where a room and petit djeuner (bathrooms are shared) Cost about $8 a day. There are 126 hotels, inns and pensions in Davos with prices varying between these figures. Skiers who plan really early can snatch a furnished apartment, which offers the most economical arrangement. The rents range from $15$20 a night for a one or twobedroom place to $30$40 for three or four bedrooms. Locations and facilities vary, and you have to do your own cooking and cleaning, but the savings are good. But apartments are difficult to get, especially at this late stage. You may be lucky and find a cancellation if you write to the Davos Tourist Office, Promenade 67, 7270, Davos Platz, Switzerland. The office circulates lists of apartment seekers, and the owners write directly to applicants.

us,"The Screen:'Paperback Hero,' Tale of Living a Fantasy","""Paperback Hero,"" the new film at the Festival Theater, is about a swashbuckling young Walter Mitty who is actually living out his fantasy and making a botch of it. It is a pictorially vivid, often engrossing motion picture that sets you ruminating on what it is really all about after you've seen it rather than while you are looking on.In a small town in Saskatchewan, the kind of place where the local beer hall functions as the sole cultural center, Rick Dillon, handsome, strong fellow, hard drinker, brawler, woman chaser and star of the local hockey team, has also decided to play the role of a marshal of the Old West. He wears the 10-gallon hat, totes a gun, sports a star and is the very image of television's Marshal Dillon.At first the town laughs with him, then it laughs at him, although respect is what Rick really craves. After all, what are his options? The hockey team, the only arena in which he stands outhe works as a clerk in a store for a livingis being closed down. He has an offer to go elsewhere to work as a building janitor, although he would like to work in ""management.""But life here has to be a dull dead end, and Rick becomes more the marshal, bringing the story to a sad, ludicrous, flamboyant finale. Real life just does not let one live in dreams without going through normal channels.Keir Dullea makes a fine, heroic nonhero. He is the very essence of the swaggering, not overbright clod who goes through all the motions of a wild one but who is really small potatoes. He has charm and humor, but it is all canned in the way of a cardboard hero of film  or paperback novel.Elizabeth Ashley, who is currently starring with Mr. Dullea on Broadway in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" has a difficult assignment, as Rick's sexy but serious, honest and loving girlfriend, and she brings to it a passion and understanding that nicely offset the stridence that envelops the story.Under Peter Pearson's direction, the town, Delisle (population 700) and its environs also achieve star status. The cameras pan over the flat dullness of it all, emphasizing the flat-country vastness and isolation of the place, a fit setting in which one man's lonely trauma becomes the community's spectacle. The eruptions of the marshal and the glamour of hockey, erupting in a riot, make all kinds of sense on this stage.

us,The Screen:'Men's Lives' Looks at Male Mystique,"""Men's Lives,"" the documentary that opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema's Filmmakers Showcase, explores the masculine mystique in a competitive society.The film was made in their native Midwest by Will Roberts and Josh Hanig, who worked two years on this first venture, starting when they were students in Antioch. It is an interesting, even entertaining look at how males grow into men, mostly aggressive - minded men, and what values rub off on them as they do so. The thesis is formed by interviews with men, boys, some women, too. And the ones who are doing the speaking are not psychologists or professional social observers. They are factory workers, teachers, coaches, athletes, students, and each presents his perspective articulately.A town barber, with the sensitivity of a good analyst, describes what his customers tell him and makes sage comment. Girls describe how they feel in relationship to the role of men. The result of all this is to give you a new view of yourself and your world.Because so much of masculine behavior seems to hinge so much on competition, there is some confusion, perhaps, about which, if either, led to which. It would be worthwhile to follow up ""Men's Lives"" with a look at masculinity in noncompetitive societies, wherever they are.Also on the bill is ""Janie's Janie,"" about a welfare mother in New Jersey, white and separated from her husband. In her own words, this working-class woman tells how, after being dominated by father and husband, she was able to develop her own personality.

He taught me that hard work is the best thing. He changed my stance, got me up on top of the plate. Without his guidance and his approach, I don't think I'd be here. During the 1947 season they almost shipped me out to the minors. I was really struggling. I struck out four times in one game against Hank Borowy of the Chicago Cubs on curveballs. But then all of a sudden I was able to hit the curveball. That season I hit 48 homers from June on, 51 altogether.

There is one major difference: The English comedies, films like ""Room at the Top"" and ""Nothing but the Best,"" were essentially concerned with the English class system and how to beat it.""Love at the Top"" has no such nourishing drive. It's about nothing more than what it seems. It's the story of a timid bank clerk (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who, under the direction of a second-rate novelist (Jean-Pierre Cassel), who conceives brilliant real-life plots, becomes one of the richest, most powerful men in Paris through a complicated series of liaisons with beautiful women and their protectors.Michel Deville (""Benjamin,"" ""The Bear and the Doll"") is one of those directors whose work is never more than competently stylish, and most of that stylishness is the kind that can be bought as easily as furniture, by hiring the right actors, cameramen, set designers and so on. In addition to Mr. Trintignant and Mr. Cassel, the cast includes Romy Schneider, as a badly used house-wife, and Jane Birkin, as a sunny-natured streetwalker. They have true style, but it can't upgrade the movie much.There is even something second-rate about the title that the film's distributors have chosen for the American release. The original French title, which was also that of the Roger Blondel novel on which it's based, is ""Le Mouton Enrag"" (The Mad Sheep). That's hardly a zinger in translation but it's better than the warmed-over associations of ""Love at the Top.""",1975-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Swift as an Insurance Salesman,"Rick Wohlhuter is a Chicago insurance salesman who can run faster than a usedcar salesman. He is the finest halfmiler in the world, the finest athlete in the world of track and field, and a mortal cinch for the Sullivan Award as the finest amateur athlete in the United States. That's triple crown that not even Secretariat could wear. When Wohlhuter runs the Howe 880 in the 68th Millrose Games in Madison Square Garden Friday night he will wind up a year that has been merely perfect. Since winning this race last winter he has competed not only at a half mile but also at 800 meters, 1,000 yards and a mile, and has never been beaten, not even as a member of the University of Chicago Track Club's relay team. In passing, he broke his own world record for the half mile and set a record of 2:13.9 for 1,000 meters, the classic distance known to the French as Le Grand Mille. His time of 1:44.1 for 880 yards is the equivalent of 1:43.4 for 800 meters, threetenths faster than the world mark held by Italy's South African, Marcello Fiasconaro, but he wasn't timed at 800 in that race.

But never was he more mysterious than in 1934 when he walked through the streets of Tokyo in a black kimono. He was there as a member of an allstar team that included Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but he had ignored the game in Omiya that day. Instead, with a bouquet of flowers, he entered St. Luke's Hospital where, speaking in Japanese, he introduced himself as a friend of Ambassador Joseph Clark Grew's daughter, Mrs. Cecil Burton, who had recently given birth to a daughter. Mrs. Burton's room was on the seventh floor. But when Moe Berg got off the elevator, he walked to a stairwell and went up to the roof, one of Tokyo's highest at the time. After unstrapping a motionpicture camera from beneath his kimono, he filmed industrial plants, oil refineries, railroad yards and warships in the bay. He reattached the camera to his body, picked up the bouquet and put it inside his kimono. Quickly he left the hospital. He never visited Ambassador Grew's daughter. ",1975-01-28T05:00:00+0000

In fact, it's the most confusing movie I've seen since several reels got mixed up during a Greek film of radiant obscurity. At any rate, this heap of murk opened yesterday at several neighborhood theaters.The movie appears to be a drama of real estate. Jason Miller plays a neighborhood fixer who is attempting to lease a warehouse for the storage of stolen goods; however, the deal is delayed, and he's threatened by the minor hoods who are his clients. His role is a study in worry: the angst rarely leaves his deep-set lemur's eyes. We watch him worrying in profile, in full and three-quarter face, standing or sitting or lying down, in daylight and darkness, on the phone, in his office and out of doors. All in all, he seems more vulnerable to an anxiety attack than to an assailant's bullet.Although much of the narrative is unfathomable, the audience knows almost everything that's going to happen, since we're warned by a series of triumphant movie clichsincluding one of the silliest prophetic dreams that's been filmed of late. Throughout, there are little lulls that promise immediate violence. And when someone buys a rabbit's foot it means that he'll have bad luck; when a character resolves to go straight and leave ""the business"" it's obvious that he'll be shot; when a couple plan a vacation we know that they won't take it. The movie also employs the maddeningly ancient device of a live man talking to a dead onewithout realizing that he's wasting his wisdom on a corpse.""The Nickel Ride"" is handsomely, filmed in bleak pastels, but the numerous close-ups manage to stress the slowness of the action, and quick cuts can't dispel the tedium. Bo Hopkins has some good moments as a chatty sadist with a face full of ominous grins; nodding his head in malicious innocence, he's given to bursts of inane chuckles. Linda Haynes is desperately bland as Mr. Miller's girlfriend, although her lines don't help: she has to say (of the woods) ""So crisp and green!"" and ""I'm a big girl!"" when her lover conceals his worries from her, and ""Oh, business, business, business!"" when he doesn't.What with the references to characters we haven't met and to events we never see and to the good old days that will never come again, one wonders if the director actually wanted to make a different picture. If only he had.",1975-01-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Alice,' Young Widow Finds Herself","Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn) would seem to be up a creek. She lives in semi-urban New Mexico, married to a human slug who drives a soft-drink truck and who is so alienated from their 12-year-old son Tommy (Alfred Lutter) that when we first see the family together it seems as if the father is no more than a particularly unpleasant, demanding boarder. Suddenly and fortuitously everything changes. Donald, Alice's husband, is killed in a highway accident and Alice must take charge of her own life, which, until this time, she has always left in the care of others.Martin Scorcese's ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, is the fine, moving, frequently hilarious tale of Alice's first lurching steps toward some kind of self-awareness and self-sufficiency.The story moves across the American Southwest as Alice and Tommy, their belongings stuffed into their station wagon, set off on the journey back to Alice's home town of Monterey, Calif. The geography is familiar and mostly flat, strewn with motels, drive-in restaurants, taverns, service stations and dinersthe bright, shiny artifacts of America's mobile optimism.The interior landscape of the film is something else again. It's a Krazy Kat world where it's difficult to tell the difference between night and day, between robust laughter and hysterical tears, where the brick that hits you in the head may cause a slight concussion but may also knock some sense into you. The experience is scary but if you keep your wits about you, as Alice ultimately does, the chances are that things will work out. You'll get a slight purchase on survival, on life.""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" seems especially remarkable because it, was directed by the man who first smashed into our consciousness with an entirely different kind of movie, ""Mean Streets,"" a male-dominated melodrama about life in New York's Little Italy.""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" is an American comedy of the sort of vitality that dazzles European film critics and we take for granted. It's full of attachments and associations to very particular times and places, even in the various regional accents of its characters. It's beautifully written (by Robert Getchell) and acted, but it's not especially neatly tailored.It begins rather badly, with an unnecessary sequence showing Alice as a little girl, and then jumps forward to Alice's home life with her slob husband, played at such a high pitch you're not sure that Mr. Scorcese and the actors will be able to sustain whatever it is they are about. You don't know at first. It's a comedy that creeps up on you, somewhere near the Arizona state line, as Tommy begins to get on Alice's nerves by threatening to be carsick.At the center of the movie and giving it a visible sensibility is Miss Burstyn, one of the few actresses at work today (another is Glenda Jackson) who is able to seem appealing, tough, intelligent, funny and bereft, all at approximately the same moment.It's Miss Burstyn's movie and part of the enjoyment of the film is in the director's apparent awarenessof this fact, as in a sequence in which Alice is making a little extra money by singing and playing ersatz cocktail-piano in a roadside tavern. Alice is never going to bring show business to its knees, but the beer drinkers love her and Mr. Scorcese circles his camera around her as lyrically as if she were Ida Lupino knocking the customers dead in ""Road House.""Of equal but less spectacular importance are the supporting players, including the men. Although this is a movie that takes women seriously, and although it is essentially the chronicle of Alice's liberation, Mr. Scorcese has not shortchanged the actors, especially Harvey Keitel, as a small-town sadist who traps Alice for a while, Kris Kristoffersen, as the comparatively gentle rancher who wins her, and Alfred Lutter, as her son who, when the chips are down, is not at all bad.Two other performances must be noted, those of Diane Ladd and Valerie Curtin as waitresses in a diner where Alice works. Their marvelous contributions in small roles are a measure of the film's quality and of Mr. Scorcese's fully realized talents as one of the best of the new American filmmakers.",1975-01-30T05:00:00+0000

When the TV personality isn't being directly evoked, the movie relies on reversals that are inside jokes for about 60 million people. Mr. Rico drinks nothing but milk (he has an ulcer) and is such a terrible golfer he uses his dog to cheat for him.The story is about the search for someone who we are meant to believe is a black militant leader turned cop-killer. It doesn't hold much water. It's such a clumsy movie it makes all the actors look dreadful, which may or may not be the fact.""Mr. Rico"" opened yesterday at the Forum and other theaters.",1975-01-30T05:00:00+0000
