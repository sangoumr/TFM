us,Screen: Search for Girls:Robert Walker Stars in 'Man From O.R.G.Y.',"O.R.G.Y. stands for Organization for the Rational Guidance of Youth, but otherwise it need, not concern you. It exists only so its director (Robert Walker) can give up his research into the erotic responses of working girls in order to track down three beautiful prostitutes who are to share a $15-million inheritance. Each heiress can be identified only by the image of a grinning gopher branded on her bottom, and to pursue his quest, Robert Walker must uncover a lot of girls. And that is what ""The Man From O. R. G. Y."", which opened yesterday at the Forum, is all about. A certain charming innocence pertains to all the low-level vulgarity, as it does to the plump, often pretty girls themselves with their piled-up hairdo's, their freighted eyelids, and their brave little attempts to say their lines.Maybe in two cases out of every three they are fun to look at, and collectively they suggest a soft solidity to shore against the flimsiness of the film's sets, which, like wallpaper without walls, shake and rustle at each passing step.Because ""The Man From O.R.G.Y."" is a dirty movie that means to be a spoof of dirty movies, it also features a lot of comedy, none of which is funny, but much of which is energetic enough somehow to engage the attention if not the interest. To an extent, this is remarkable, because the film seems determined to repeat each of its comic ideas, no matter how awful, at least three times.It more or less has to just to fit in the acts. Not only has it a black-white male comedy team (White and Rossi; White's black), but also a female impersonator (his name is Lynn Carter, and he does Hermione Gingold, Phyllis Diller, Marlene Dietrich, and of course, Bette Davis), a real-female comedienne (Louisa Moritz), and a large cast of minor characters every one of whom has a routine. By the time each man has shown his stuff and each girl has had a chance to strip a little, ""The Man From O.R.G.Y."" resembles not so much a movie as a last bastion of individualist free enterprise against the encroaching coltivism of our society.",1970-04-04T05:00:00+0000

Most are from the l8th and 19th centuries, though their tradition is said to date back to the 5th century A.D.

Until recently, data on traffic fatalitieslike those on crime and other negative subjectswere closely guarded state se crets in the U.S.S.R. But it has now been announced that motor vehicles killed 16,000 persons last year in the Russian Republic, an area that has only slightly more than half the total Soviet population. Allowing for population, therefore, it seems likely that about 30,000 persons died in Soviet traffic accidents last year. The Soviet Union has less than 10 per cent as many motor vehicles as this country. If cars and trucks here had been killing people at the same rate per million vehicles as in the Soviet Union, more than 300,000 Americansinstead of 56,400would have died on the road in 1969.",1970-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,'How to Suceed With Sex' Arrives,"""WOULD you like to start here, in the center of the room, and progress to the bed in steps of growing eroticism?"" the sweet-limbed young call-girl unaffectedly asks. Clean-cut young Jack agrees. And together they begin the climax that leads to the conclusion of ""How to Succeed with Sex,"" an occasionally pleasant dirty movie that opened yesterday at the Penthouse and Pacific East theaters.Principally, one will wish to see this movie for its women, who are lovely. But one may also listen to its dialogue, which is ironic, literate, and occasionally even funny.The title derives from a book that Jack (Zack Taylor) buys to help him seduce his fiance, Sandy (Mary Jane Carpenter), a most resolute and unlikely virgin, and that speaks to him, in a gravelly voice, throughout the movie. He succeeds part of the time and fails part of the time, and fantasizes like crazy all off the time.Often the fantasies get in the way of success or failure, and then ""How to Succeed with Sex"" declines into a nervous classy photography approach to its subject that seems designed chiefly to keep you from seeing enough. But once in a while the fantasies suggest a real point of view that is more complicated and more sophisticated than the film's premises might have led you to expect.An amphibious film, at least half of ""How to Succeed with Sex"" takes place in swimming pools and at marinas and on a sailboat off the California coast. In this context the cult of the body, especially the Southern California body, seems a reasonable religion  for which Victoria Bond and Bambi Allen and Luanne Roberts and all the nameless beauties who bounce through Jack's dreams are healthy prophets.But on the other side, Shawn Devereaux, a cocktail lounge pick-up, and the only girl in the cast who looks old enough to have graduated high school, parodies pornography consciously, and with a civilized wickedness that indicates she is all together, body and soul.",1970-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A New Truffaut:'Mississippi Mermaid' Uncoils Complexly,"FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT's ""The Mississippi Mermaid"" has the form of a preposterous romantic melodrama, but it is so full of lovely, complex thingsof unannounced emotions, of ideas, of the memories of other movies (Truffaut's, as well as of those of two of his father-figures, Renoir and Hitchcock)that it defies easy definition and blithely triumphs over what initially appears to be structural schizophrenia. It is the creation of a superior moviemaker who works eccentrically in the classical tradition.For approximately half of its running time, ""The Mississippi Mermaid"" proceeds as a conventional mystery: Louis Mah (Jean-Paul Belmondo), a tobacco planter on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, has sent away for a mail-order bride. When Julie (Catherine Deneuve) arrives, it's quite apparent that she is not the girl with whom he has been corresponding. However, she is so beautiful, so sweetly enigmatic, so (he says) worthy of adoration, he dismisses his doubts until he comes home one evening to find Julie gone, along with most of his cash resources, amounting to something like 27-million francs.Several months later, while recuperating from an illness in the south of France, Louis finds Julie hustling in an Antibes discothque. When he finally confronts her, she admits everything and, in several minutes of detailed exposition that seems to destroy the movie we've been watching, she simply explains away the plot of murder, blackmail, deception and double cross.One mystery film ends and another begins. At least, it seems that way until you realize that Truffaut, as fond as he is of the mechanics of surface intrigue, is more profoundly fascinated by explorations of loneliness and love, which comprise, of course, a different kind of mystery.This, actually, is what ""The Mississippi Mermaid"" is all about, right from the movie's opening credits that are presented against the background of a newspaper's ""personal"" ads. On the soundtrack voices are heard, first one, then another, and then a kind of chorus of controlled desperation (""Young girl, serious, pretty. . . ."" ""Bachelor, 35, interested in music. . . .""). Everyone is searching for love.In ""The Mississippi Mermaid,"" as in all of Truffaut's films, love leads only to an uncertain future that, at best, may contain some joy along with the inevitable misery. Truffaut's special talent, however, is for communicating a sense of the value of that joy.As he did in ""The Bride Wore Black,"" Truffaut here has taken as his source material a rather shabbily written mystery romance by Cornell Woolrich (the sort of book in which a lady's mouth might be described as looking like crushed rose petals), published in this country as ""Waltz Into Darkness"" and in France as ""La Sirne du Mississippi."" He has followed the broad outlines of the original quite closely, while updating the period and shifting the locale. However, because Truffaut is a more gifted filmmaker than Woolrich was a novelist, the film successfully neutralizes elements that in Woolrich are dramatic absurdities.""The Mississippi Mermaid"" is the sort of melodrama in which a young man and his wife, fleeing from the police, will get into an argument over the way he drives. ""Richard,"" she says, cheerfully recalling an earlier lover to annoy her husband, ""always swore at other drivers. Those who passed him were S.O.B.'s. Those who didn't were morons."" He makes her get out and walk.The film is filled with visual references: to Renoir (to whom it is dedicated), to Nick Ray (""Johnny Guitar""), to his own ""Shoot the Piano Player,"" and to Balzac, the author read most by Truffaut heros. It is also played with marvelous style by Belmondo, Miss Deneuve and by Michel Bouquet (""La Femme Infidele"") who, as the detective originally hired by Belmondo to find his wife, is the figure of absurd, unflappable self-assurance that has stalked through Truffaut's last three films, once as a heroine (""The Bride Wore Black""), and here as a villain.""The Mississippi Mermaid"" is a difficult, abrasive movie with lots of faults that, to me, are ultimately academic. I like it very much, but I suspect that United Artists, the distributor, does not. They opened it yesterday at the 72d Street Playhouse with all the care and fanfare that might be accorded the closing of a supermarket.",1970-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Robert Sparr's 'Once You Kiss a Stranger',"ACCORDING to the critic's sheet, the screenplay to Robert Sparr's ""Once you Kiss a Stranger,"" playing with ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,"" was suggested by a novel by Patricia Highsmith. I assume the novel is ""Strangers on a Train,"" for ""Once You Kiss a Stranger"" builds upon the same premise of murder by surrogate that Alfred Hitchcock used in his great 1951 film.But in place of the psychological complexities of Hitchcock's ""Strangers,"" this movie substitutes a few sexual simplicities. And for the multiple personalities crises of Farley Granger and Robert Walker, it offers a one-dimensional parody of psychotic menace as bad-girl Carol Lynley preys upon good-guy Paul Burke.Burke plays a struggling professional golfer whose tournament nemesis (Philip Carey) is killed as an unrequested favor by Miss Lynley, an attractive young homicidal maniac, who in return wants him to eliminate her psychiatristso she can go to Europe rather than to the crazy house, where she belongs.Admirers of ""Strangers on a Train"" will recall that the killer thinks he has devised a perfect crime of motiveless murders, which the sharers must keep secret and for which he will plant false evidence (the famous cigarette lighterwhich reappears in ""Once You Kiss a Stranger"") only if his partner reneges.But Carol Lynley sets about things as if her real purpose were publicity, and the point of the plot (let alone whatever meaning it might have been given) is lost in her expertise with sneaky creepy TV cameras, edited tapes, and the fancier paraphernalia of blackmail.Committed to a spiritual desert between the golf course and the gossip column, ""Once You Kiss a Stranger"" wastes even its random cruelties in conspicuous display.Among the cast, Carol Lynley seems more interesting than her role. Martha Hyer (as Burke's estranged wife) seems even less interesting than her role, and Peter Lind Hayes (as an ancient tournament competitor) develops a horrendous characterization of country-club rusticity that, according to the film, is ""known in golfing circles as 'the Old Pro.'""",1970-04-16T05:00:00+0000

Watching it in the company of a (probably) bored parent, I wouldn't have hesitated to ask such questions as ""Why'd the goat explode?"" or ""What's that lady doing crawling on the ground  is she sick or something?""The goat explodes and the lady (who's not sick, just mad with passion) crawls on the ground because ""Thanos and Despina"" is a mock-folk epic about passions so primitive and basic that perhaps only music can define them.The scene is contemporary Greece and the people picturesque, peasants oppressed by church, state, drought and superstition, to say nothing of other peasants. It opens with the belly of that starving goat erupting into the eye of the camera and it ends with a young man and a young woman, fleeing authority, jumping off a cliff. Because it's Easter, someone says ""Greece is resurrected."" Greece is resurrected, indeed.The film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Village as part of the Grove Press International Film Festival, is the second movie to be directed by Nico Papatakis, a Jack-of-all-trades of Greek-Ethiopian parentage who lives in Paris and calls himself a spokesman for the avant-garde. (His first film; ""Les Abysses, which I did not see, wa presented here in 1964.)Papatakis apparently means for ""Thanos and Despina"" to be taken as political allegory (the villian of the piece is a young man named Yankos). Allegory, however, is rather like quicksilver: it needs some kind of vessel to give it shape. There are times when ""Thanos and Despina"" seems on the point of becoming a lunatic ""Romeo and Juliet,"" but because it never makes sense as coherent drama, it has even less meaning as allegory.The photography is quite lovely with its brilliantly contrasting, grainy tones of blacks and whites. There is, however, something patronizing about this loveliness, as there is about the entire film. It's as if somebody said: ""Oh, let's go down and look at the peasants tonight. They are real.""",1970-04-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Haunting Indecisions of 'Brotherly Love',"""MUMMY,"" says Sir Charles Henry Arbuthnot Pinkerton Ferguson (Peter O'Toole), ""left me the most extraordinary amount of phenobarbital."" She also left him so emotionally dependent on his sister Hilary (Susannah York) that Hilary can't bring herself to leave the family dairy farm to take up residence with her decent, dull husband.Hilary is not only afraid Pink will attempt suicide again, but she herself quite enjoys the lifetheir manic squabbles and their sharing of afternoon booze, topped off, perhaps, by a nice hot tub with a toy duck in the bathwater. It's apparent that the duck was not the only thing Pink and Hilary shared in their childhood.The name of James Kennaway's original novel was ""Household Ghosts."" When Kennaway adapted it as a play, it was called ""Country Dance,"" which was the title it bore when production began on the film version. During the filming, it was known briefly as ""The Same Skin,"" and yesterday the cinematic ghost of the novel opened at the Paris Theater as ""Brotherly Love.""I mention all this because the movie and its two principal characters are haunted by the same sort of indecision that seems to have marked the search for a title. The screenplay, written by Kennaway just before he died in 1968, is a series of scenes, which, although big, are never exactly obligatory. It does seem, in fact, that the movie's real obligatory scenes must have taken place years before, when Pink and Hilary stopped being lovers. The film merely records the events leading to their final inevitable separation.The course of these events is often tumultuous but never terribly affecting. O'Toole looks so thin and haggard that the enormous energy of his performance comes as a genuine surprise. It also comes to seem completely mechanical. This, however, may partly be the result of Kennaway's foundness for literary dialogue, heavy with dim similes (""Country dances, like country manners, are very old and very true""). The screenplay is also heavy with exposition, a lot of which is given to Miss York, who is an actress of intelligence and humor. Happily she is also endowed with an elastic lower lip that can be stretched around a line such as: ""Oh God! Mummy did us enough harm when she was alive. Why did she have to go and die suddenly like that?""The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson with what is usually referred to as taste. The scenes of rural Scotland are set very prettily. Individual confrontations have a theatrical tension that seems to elude the movie as a whole. Somehow, it is typical of the film that we never see the outside of the house where Hilary and Pink live, although we are in it almost constantly. At the same time, the camera explores their faces and never once suggests what's really going on behind the facades of skin.""Brotherly love"" is so tasteful in this regardas if it didn't want to shockthat it seems downright platonic, which, under the circumstances, is a bit of a bore.",1970-04-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Early Works,' Yugoslav Romanticism","""SO MY FILM is about the impossibility of changing the world by romantic means . . . ,"" but it is a romantic film nonetheless, an evocation of lucid idealism and of a dim reality that turns everything to confusion and defeat, but that does not lose its hold upon the imagination. ""Early Works"" is the first feature of Zelimir Zilnik, Yugoslav, not yet 30, revolutionary, and with the sense to know from what, as well as for what, he speaks.At one point he even has somebody cry ""Down with Romantics!,"" but the scene belies the sentiment: a broad calm river, a drifting raft, the early mista little like the great farewell to the River Po in Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Before the Revolution,"" another young man's movie about the futilityand beautyof romantic means. And once he holds his camera, for maybe 10 whole secconds on his sleeping heroine's profile, an enraptured, reticent and wholly romantic homage to her breathtaking and challenging beauty.Her name is Yugoslavia, and together with three males shouting slogans and even conversing in aphorisms (""additional dialogue by Marx and Engels""), she sets out to persuade the peasants that the world must change. The four comrades fail, and as their revolutionary play grows more serious, it also becomes a self-destructive testing of intent, ending in a real killing and immolation for which all the practice, the ""political theater"" of Molotov cocktails and torture games, has been a preparation.In style, ""Early Works"" resembles middle-period Jean-Luc Godard, looking a bit like ""Band of Outsiders,"" and sounding a bit like ""La Chinoise."" In its borrowings, and in its many (sometimes academic) technical excesses, it is clearly a young man's movie. But Zilnik has managed to fuse his insights and his imitations into a form of personal expression that is often deeply moving and is always under conscious and complex control. The film builds upon a series of rhetorical positions  but for each, there is a point of view that transforms didacticism into drama.None of the performers seems especially distinguished, except for Milja-Vujanovic (Yugoslavia), but when she is on the screen it is really difficut to look at anybody else. In a sense the film is a tribute to her beauty, her toughness, her navet, her pathos. She is, of course, a heroine of a picaresque romance that is disguised as diatribe, and emerges finally as tragedy.I liked ""Early Works"" when it played last fall in the Museum of Modern Art's Yugoslav series. Seeing it again, at its commercial opening at the Bleecker Street Evergreen Cinema, I like it even more.",1970-04-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Sympathy for the Devil' ('1+1'),"AN English-language movie by Jean-Luc Godard, opened theatrically yesterday at the Murray Hill. If you go on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Sunday, you will see Godard's film, which is properly known as ""1 + 1."" On other days, you will see a film popularly advertised as ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" which exactly resembles ""1 + 1"" except that in the latter part of the last reel a complete version of the song ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" which the Rolling Stones have been rehearsing and recording in cuts throughout the film, is played on the soundtrack. Several monochromatic stills of the film's last shot are added to fill out the song's time. The changes and additions are the work of the producer, Iain Quarrier.Why anyone, given the choice, would prefer a producer's version of a movie to a director's escapes me. The movie to see at the Murray Hill is ""1 + 1."" Not only does the use of the song impose a sense of emotional fulfillment (and, I think, the wrong sense of fulfillment) upon a conclusion that does not ask for it, but also the use of the song's title for the movie suggests a meaning that is less interesting in context than, say, the proposition ""1 + 1 equals 2.""For ""1 + 1"" is a heavily didactic, even instructional, film, like much recent Godard, and it builds upon repetition, or, if you will, addition. The Rolling Stones' repeated assays upon ""Sympathy for the Devil"" in their recording studio, the rote repetitions of passages and slogans passed back and forth among black-power revolutionaries in their river-side automobile junkyard, the mere adding up of questions and answers in the interview sequences, juxtaposing words to make new combinations (such as ""So-Viet Cong"") and finding new words in old combinations (such as SDS in ""Sight and Sound""; LOVE in ""All About Eve"")all suggest a concern with ways of putting things together, to the film seems determined to be the prospective text of some ultimate, infinitely complex collectivism.Whatever its intentions, ""1 + 1"" contemplates rather than advocates revolution. It collects evidence and examines texts  including a by now famous pornographic political novel read on the sound track (""'You're my kind of girl, Pepita', said Pope Paul as he lay down on the grass . . .,"" etc.)records interviews (""The Occident is fighting communism because the Occident is Faustian?"" ""Yes.""), and observes the forces preparing the apocalypse.In ""1 + 1"" the camera comes alive on its cranes and tracks. As if lost in a precise meditation it moves deliberately among the persons and places of the Stones' recording studio or from wreck to wreck in the fantastic black power junk heap.The chief delight of the film lies in this precision and in these scenes. At the end, when it martyrs its one named character, Eve Democracy (Anne Wiazemski), it spreads her body across a mighty camera crane on a seashore. The crane lifts her in a great sweeping movement, red and black flags flying in the wind, across the sky. And at this moment, and not until this moment, it seems possible that the meaning of Godard's film depends not only upon a cause but also upon the camera's eye; not only in sympathy, but in objectivity as well.",1970-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,'Zigzag' Fantasy Opens at the Coronet,"""ZIGZAG"" finally does a tailspin. A great deal of ability and perspiration has gone into this suspense melodrama about a supposedly dying man, who cooks up a fantastic swindle scheme to benefit his family, snaps to after an operation and tries to wiggle out of the mess. And a mess it truly is, for this cunning chap, believing he is doomed by a brain tumor, has deliberately gotten himself tried and convicted for a dormant, unsolved murder case.What now to save his skin? Having hornswoggled a keen insurance company, the Los Angeles police force, his own suspicious lawyer and a jury, he now nips out of a prison hospital into town and in a few hours, and more or less intuitively, unearths the real murderer.Anybody who believes this intricate story, painstakingly developed by John T. Kelley's scenario, will believe anything. As the deceptive hero, a man who pulls off a miracle comparable to Jonah's, George Kennedy performs with dogged, admirable sincerity. Better still, however, are Anne Jackson as his confounded wife, and Eli Wallach as his exasperated lawyer, and with good reason.For not only is the incredibly farfetched plot cluttered with trivial details and zigzagging flashbacks, it also rushes forward breathlessly behind what amounts to a directorial smokescreen. Richard A. Colla, a sharp new talent, has elected to flip an already baffling plot at the viewer teasingly, in flying bits and pieces, with a twitching camera that goes hysterical at the climax, along with the sound track. The color, by the way, is excellent.Steve Ihnat, William Marshall and others do well on the sidelines. But even if you can keep apace of ""Zigzag,"" you won't believe it.",1970-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Hi, Mom!' a Brian De Palma Satire","AMONG contemporary-urban-scene-movies (sub-genre, invasion-of-privacy) Brian De Palma's ""Hi, Mom!"" stands out for its wit, its ironic good humor, its multilevel sophistications, its technical ingenuity, its nervousness, and its very special ability to bring the sensibility of the suburbs to the sins of the inner city. With no recognizable landmark further north than Cooper Square, it nevertheless feels like Bronxville or the quieter stretches of the upper East Side.Not that it aspires to quietness or that it even for a second eschews relevancy. One major portion (for me, the best portion) depicts an all-black play production, ""Be Black, Baby,"" in which the cast, in white face, mingles with, steals from, and finally beats and rapes the white liberal audience. And the hero, a young Vietnam veteran, moves from filthy picture-taking to middle-class apartment house bombing, partly in an effort to achieve total involvementwhich, in the terms of this film, seems necessarily to include a final solution.But the eager hero (Robert De Niro) and the over-eager heroine (Jennifer Salt, the major interest of the flashbacks in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" revealed as a fine comedienne here) are so clean-cut; the second leads, white and black, so epitomize attractive youth; and the supporting cast, as in many Brian De Palma movies, could so handsomely model a panoramic painting of the Rape of the Seven Sister Colleges; that an air of tasteful respectability pervades even the outrageous violence. As if they were making bombs on West 11th Street.""Hi, Mom!"" turns approximately every other current social misery to a comedy that is sometimes quite elabborately successful and sometimes only well intentioned. As in De Palma's previous ""Greetings,"" the humor, at its best, is understated but highly structuredso that you have to work a bit for your laughs. But ""Hi, Mom!"" is much sharper, crueler, funnier. Although it scatters some shots (often in a kind of fast-motion photography that seems an addiction of De Palma's) it pulls enough together to suggest some major insights, as it investigates the militarization and despoliation of Washington Square South.But it is the minor insights that most happily remain: the white black-power activist (Gerrit Graham) who for a second demurs before painting his body entirely black; the pornographic-movie impresario (Allen Garfield) who wants to make ""the first children's exploitation filmnothing dirty, nothing smutty;"" or the mere idea of the TV show that chronicles the opening night of ""Be Black, Baby!"" A production of National Intellectual Television, it is called ""N.I.T. Journal,"" which, (to my mind, comes under the category of what oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.",1970-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Richard Harris in 'Man Called Horse',"""A MAN CALLED HORSE"" is Lord John Morgan (Richard Harris), an English aristocrat who is captured by Sioux Indians in the course of a hunting trip through the Dakotas in the early 19th century. Lord John not only survives his initial captivity but he goes on to prove his manhood so well that he eventually becomes a great white chief, the sort of superhero exalted by American romantics from James Fenimore Cooper to Edgar Rice Burroughs.The film, which was directed by Elliot Silverstein (""Cat Ballou,"" ""The Happening""), places great stress on authenticity of ritual and language (""80 per cent of the dialogue,"" say my production notes, ""is in Sioux, and in old Sioux at that!""), although a couple of odd faces turn upquite at homein the old Sioux camp.The ancient squaw, who looks like Mammy Yokum in a fright wig, is actually Dame Judith Anderson, whom publicists like to describe as one of the great actresses of the English-speaking theater. Here, however, she is restricted to speaking pure Lakotan, which sometimes sounds like Yiddish The Indian princess who wins Lord John's hand is played by Corrina Tsopei, a Miss Greece who went on to oblivion as Miss Universe of 1964.In these details, ""A Man Called Horse"" is conventionally absurd. However, Silverstein has elected to tell the story of Lord John's survival largely in terms of Sioux rituals relating to such things as wars, weddings, deaths, and even spiritual deliverance. I must admit that I found all this interesting, although I'm the sort of Indian buff and tourist who gets a kick out of watching contemporary Navajos do their rain dances in tennis shoes.There are no tennis shoes in ""A Man Called Horse,"" but there is a good deal of blood, as well as an emphasis on salvation-through-mutilation.An old squaw acknowledges the death of her son by slicing off several fingers. Harris, whose performance is mostly one of endurance, shows himself worthy of an Indian bride, by allowing himself to be suspended by ropes attached animal bones that are, in turn, stuck through the skin of his chest. I would thus hesitate to recommend. ""A Man Called Horse,"" which opened yesterday at the Astor and Loew's Orpheum Theaters, to small children, the audience for whom it was probably intended. On second thought, the children of my generation played with tomahawks, and I can't remember that we ever actually succeeded in scalping anybody.",1970-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Filmed 'Diary of a Schizophrenic Girl' Arrives,"NELSO RISI'S ""Diary of a Schizophrenic Girl"" is based upon the autobiography of a schizophrenic patient, which was translated from the French, together with commentary by her analyst, Marguerite Sechehaye, and first published here 20 years ago. Although properly speaking a fiction film rather than a study of schizophrenia, it nevertheless involves considerable explanation of the disease and its treatment, mostly spoken by the therapist (Margarita Lozano) in insufficiently dramatized situations.They are, however, the only serious insufficiencies in a tactfully realized film, and, in context, even they are redeemed again and again by the clarity of Nelo Risi's images and the lucidity of Ghislaine D'Orsay's performance as Anna, the teenage girl who thinks herself a little rod of iron until her therapist's intensely personal treatment opens her to the demands and satisfactions of the external world.The other actors range from solidly professional (Miss Lozano) to stolidly amateur (Umbato Raho, as Anna's father), but Miss D'Orsay, in a beautiful and absolutely unsentimental projection of madness as a form of inwardness, excells every other performance I have seen in recent movies.As a director, Risi knows exactly how to leave her alone. Indeed, the camera often discovers her by withdrawing from herto present a world that is not her world but that nevertheless contains and somehow, awkwardly, sustains her. Set mostly in Lucerne, the location of Anna's clinic, and the home of her therapist, the film uses the city, its architecture, its streets, its lake, to support and differentiate its action. Often ""Diary of a Schizophrenic Girl"" is a joy to watch because it is visually so seemly, so decently balanced. And at its very best, as in the suicide attempt that follows a crisis in Anna's cure, it achieves a fine dramatic urgency largely granted it by the authority of so plain and forthright rhetoric.Perhaps you won't think you have too much of a good thing, some fool (not the composer of the good background music) has added a song for the opening and closing credits. Sung by Julius La Rosa, with lyrics that begin ""If love can hurry home to some, why was love so slow to cometo Anna,"" it has nothing at all to do with the lovely small movie it frames.",1970-04-30T05:00:00+0000
