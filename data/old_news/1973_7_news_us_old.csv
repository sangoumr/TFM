us,The Unnatural History of the Nanny,"Eli de Rothschild once remarked that when he was in a German concentration camp he could tell at glance which of the Frenchmen there had been brought up by an English nanny. They sat calmly, their bed spaces neat, their clothes folded. The selfdiscipline imposed by nanny morality, backed by maxims such as A place for everything, and everything in its place, was strong enough to maintain orderly habits, even in the most trying of circumstances. So the men sat still on their bunks, utterly prohibited by early training from improving survival odds by fighting for a better space or an extra blanket. Perhaps they were immobilized too by another nanny saying, the Catch22 of the nursery world: Those who ask don't get; those who don't ask don't The English upper classes have always been very good at getting rid of their children. Jonathan GathorneHardy, in his entertaining and original study of one of their more successful solutions to the problem of offspring, begins his history of the nanny with a brief survey of past AngloSaxon attitudes to childhood. In the 16th and 17th centuries, for example, child swapping was commonly practiced between households of equal social standing. At the age of six or seven the little, defective adult, sodden with original sin, in GathorneHardy's phrase, was dispatched to be socialized among strangers, rarely seeing his natural parents, for whom naturally enough he therefore felt no affection. The disadvantage of this system of childraising by remote control was that one had, often, in return, to harbor someone else's child. And there was still the awkward initial phase when the infant was generally thought too",1973-07-01T05:00:00+0000

The walls are lined with dark, fragrant trees and the floor is carpeted with thick green grass. Around the edge of the garden runs a partial ceiling of dustypink tentingpropped up on tall gray poles resembling medieval spears. Several hundred yards behind me is the entrance to this outdoor theater, a massive 18thcentury wroughtiron gate flanked by two stone horse heads that are the work of Malvina Hoffman. At the opposite end of the garden stands an open pavilion of pink marble columns topped by pointed Venetian arches forming the backdrop for a mediumsize orchestra. The air is fresh and cool with a hint of rain that will never arrive. (During the second piece on the program, a single star appears in the sky and there is an audible sigh of relief from the audience.) The music is Mozarta graceful serenade, a concerto for clarinet, one for French horn, and the familiar, robust Haffner symphony. After intermission, I stroll back to the gate and discover that the acoustics are still good at a considerable distance from the stage. If I continue through the gate and turn left, I will eventually arrive at a rambling twostory Florentine villa that could have been built by one of the Medicis. Are we in the Tuscan hills? The Veneto campagna? The private garden of a Salzburg schloss? Not at all.

Boorstin's approach to American history should be familiar to readers by now, especially those who have read the first. two volumes of the trilogy that is now complete with the publication of The Americans: The Democratic Experience. (The first volume, subtitled The Colonial Experience, appeared in 1958; the second, The National Experience, which carried Mr, Boorstin's epic through the Civil War, came out in 1965.) All the same, before I get down to quibbling over Mr. Boorstin's unusual technique, let me celebrate some of those delights as they manifest themselves in this final volume. There is, to begin with, the concreteness of his narrative. He does not write history that alludes obliquely, or flash evidence like a prestidigitator doing card tricks. No, when Mr. Boorstin takes up, say, The Decline of the Miraculous as theme of the last hundred years or so, and gets down, more specifically, to the Leveling of Times and Places, he goes straight to the gut of detail. Time and Place suggest to him first of all the matter of food; and before we have had time to absorb this odd.step of logic, he is off and telling us the story of Gail Borden, who, when he learned of the horrendous Donner Party incident (in which a group of starving transcontinental emigrants committed cannibalism), set about to perfect some form of portable food, and, after failing to sell the American public on the idea of meat biscuits, came up with you've guessed it!

us,Film: 'Oklahoma Crude':Kramer Directs Scott and Faye Dunaway,"""Oklahoma Crude"" is Stanley Kramer's least solemn movie since ""So This Is New York,"" the very funny but financially unsuccessful adaptation of the Ring Lardner novel that marked Kramer's debut as a film producer in 1948 (and is still one of my favorite comedies). It is less solemn than even ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" that behemoth of a slapstick comedy, which Kramer directed as well as produced. In the context of such Kramer works as ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" ""On the Beach"" and ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" his new film is virtually a tonic, but maybe I'm letting myself get carried away.""Oklahoma Crude"" is Stanley Kramer, the director-producer, working very hard doing his damndest, as a matter of factto entertain us with the kind of fiction that Edna Ferber used to write with such an easy touch that clich was gentled into something approaching true style.The story is set in the great Oklahoma oil fields some time before World War I, when American free enterprise was the purest form of piracy. The characters include a headstrong, tempestuous beauty named Lena (Faye Dunaway), who looks ravishing in long johns, trainman's boots and a dirty face, and who hates men; Lena's father, Cleon (John Mills), a charming ne'er-do-well; and an oil field drifter named Mase (George C. Scott), who signs on for cash to help Lena fight the Pan-Oklahoma oil trust (which wants to take Lena's well away from her) but who stays on when he falls in love with her.Marc Norman's original screenplay (which was later turned into a novel) is not exactly wall-to-wall with surprises, but part of the appeal of such fiction is the anticipation of scenes we know to be obligatory, such as the one in which Lena admits that, after all, she is a woman. It is also necessary that someone important to the plot be killed in the showdown fight with the villains, and that, just when all hope has gone, the gusher be brought in with a whoop and a holler and with everyone standing around the rig getting marvelously drenched in the sticky stuff. Suspense is never a matter of what, but of who and when.The variations that ""Oklahoma Crude"" works on the familiar formula are largely the work of Scott. It is a broadly comic performance, beginning with lots of double takes, protestations of offended dignity and expressions of horror at the thought of violence, even though we know that the character will turn out to be true blue and brave, or Scott would not be playing it. The performances of Miss Dunaway, Mills and Jack Palance, who plays the chief oil company villain, are more conventional but still quite classy under the ordinary circumstances.Kramer's approach to sheer entertainment, as it is to important and timely subjects, is rather plodding if not truly solemn. Moments of high spirits and good humor are not particularly convincing, and there is such a fondness for shots of beautiful sunrises that I suspect he wishes the movie had more than just a message about the value of individual integrity. Still, compared to his other recent films, ""Oklahoma Crude"" comes very close to being refreshing, a medium-big and brawling adventure film.",1973-07-04T05:00:00+0000

I came from that generation that was programed to connect, explains Christopher Larsen, the somber protagonist of the playwright Robert Anderson's first novel, After. It is just about the most penetrating thing that Larsen has to say in a narrative overly fond of such words as infinitely, desperately, incredibly, and terrible (as in terrible need). Nor is Chris Larsen ever very clear about what, or whom, he is trying to connect with, or disconnect from. After begins as a devoted husband's memorial to a wife who has just died of cancer.

There were love letters from Larsen, written to an actress when his wife's own acting career was getting him down. And now, what with the other actress's messy divorce proceedings threatening to bring these letters to light, Larsen must do a little explaining to his standoffish son, his new young lover and all the friends who always thought the Larsens marriage ideal. It is as if a meandering story had suddenly made up its mind to be about the illusion and reality of a marriage, when it is much too late to be about anything in particular, except the hero's confused attempts to make connections....",1973-07-05T05:00:00+0000

Neither could possibly have imagined then that Mathews would now be managing the Braves and that Aaron would now be charging inexorably toward Babe Ruth's home run record of 714. Back in 1954 Mathews was a powerfully muscled young man of 22 with the ability to hit a baseball vast distances. No one dared dream in those days that any of the Babe's records would ever be threatened. If anyone had been that rase, however, he might have selected Mathews as a qualified challenger. This was the youthful slugger who had slammed 25 homers in his freshman season with the Boston Braves and then tagged 47 as a sophomore with the Milwaukee Braves, thereby celebrating the franchise switch.

us,"Film: 'Cahill, United States Marshal' Stars Wayne","The air must be cleared. The truth can no longer be covered upno matter who is hurt. Someone must state the facts: John Wayne has reached the awkward age, which, in his case, is an official 66. When Shirley Temple became 12, there were those who said her career was over. She was too old for repeats of ""The Little Colonel,"" but not yet old enough for politics. However, she survived, as I am sure Wayne will, but how is anybody's guess.Certainly not in things like ""Cahill, United States Marshal,"" a tacky Western of drowsy pace in which Wayne plays the title character, a tough old law officer whose two sons, Danny, 17, and Billy Joe, 12, assist in robbing a bank when dadas is his wontis away chasing badmen. The lads, whose mother is dead, feel deprived of dad's company.It's not outrageous that Wayne should play a United States marshal or that he should be the father of two such young sons (though someone felt obliged to insert a line into the script to the effect that ""we had our children late in life""). What has become increasingly difficult to accept is Wayne's peculiar physical presence.Unlike most people as they age, Wayne is not shrinking and shriveling, nor is he becoming in any way decrepit. Instead, he is swelling up like a balloon. He is not only getting bigger and rounder, he is also getting visibly lighter. He sort of floats through this movie with no heft whatsoever. He gets shot several times, and stabbed once, but he seems less indestructible than puncture-proof, automatically and wondrously self-sealing. He is a plastic man.""Cahill, United States Marshal"" was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and written by Harry Julian Fink and Rita M. Fink. Perhaps recognizing the new limitations of their star, they spend a good deal of time trying to turn a conventional Western into a children-in-peril movie. Danny (Gary Grimes) and Billy Joe (Clay O'Brien), basically decent kids, of course, are terrorized by the robbers they once helped, in situations borrowed from ""Tom Sawyer"" freely but without wit or true sentiment.In addition to Wayne and the boys, the cast includes George Kennedy, who plays a clean-cut, nicely mannered badman, and Neville Brand, who plays Wayne's sidekick, a half-breed Indian and an excellent tracker who talks like a social worker. ""You got a bad feeling about your Paw,"" he tells young Danny, ""because he's not home every night."" A line like that would have sent Huck Finn hooting back to the raft. Danny, however, begins to melt.",1973-07-12T05:00:00+0000

It was suggested that the book was not written to generate money and publicity for the author, as some observers have suggested, but rather as a logical outgrowth of certain themes that have been preoccupying Mr. Mailer in recent yearschief among them women, sex and cinema. It was further argued that Marilyn is not a biography at all or even an attempt at one, but instead a meditation on certain biographical facts, a speculation on certain biographical possibilities, an attempt to mythicize a tentative reality. (For this reason, it is beside the point to tax Mr. Mailer for leaning on other people's books to accumulate his facts or to ques tion why he did not pin those facts down more energetically, especially where they relate to his rather hairraising theory of why Miss Monroe may have been mur dered). Finally, I concluded, what really matters is whether Marilyn succeeds in its own termswhether Mr. Mailer has justified the imaginative liberties he has taken with the truth of his subject's life.

For those who do believe, no explanation is necessary.Is that from ""The Song of Bernadette""? ""Going My Way""? ""The Secret Storm""? No matter. It's pretty much the way I feel about Hermann Hesse's ""Siddhartha,"" the fable about a young Brahmin's search for wisdom and spiritual peace written by the Nobel Prize-winning German author and poet who died in 1962 at the age of 85.One either accepts ""Siddhartha"" with rapture, in the kind of ecstasy that is Novocaine to thought, or one throws up. I say that immediately because it has a great deal to do with my reactions to the simple, solemn film version that Conrad Rooks has made in India, and that opened here yesterday at the Columbia One and other theaters.""Siddhartha,"" originally published in 1922, was first translated into English in the early nineteen-fifties and for the last four or five years has been one of the bigger things in American paperback publishing. Its popularity, on college campuses and off, especially with dropouts, is awe-inspiring, a little depressing, and probably as foolish to fight as a musical adaptation of ""Love Story"" by Rod McKuen. It's the one book to be read by people who don't read books.Although Hesse has been incorrectly heralded as the prophet of the drug culture, his novel's aggressive anti-intellectualism, enunciated in dime-store prose-poetry, provides comparable escape from social and political responsibility. Don't think, it says, feel. Knowledge can be taught, it says, but wisdom must be experienced. (To which I would add, like death.) Don't try to do anything about the mess in the world around you, find your own peace and to hell with everyone else (unless, of course, they can find their peace simultaneously).Mr. Rooks's film is a fairly faithful adaptation of Hesse's fable, the product of a journey to India undertaken by the author a half-century before the Beatles and Mia Farrow had even booked passage. The time is a mythical past and the conflict is one that continues throughout Hesse's work. Flesh battles spirit to a mystical draw, to the revelation that all things are one: youth, age, sin, grace, life, death, stones, tadpoles.Siddhartha (Shashi Kapoor), accompanied by his lap-dog friend Govinda (Romesh Sharma), leaves his father's house to find wisdom with a troupe of traveling holy men. He learns how to meditate, how to fast, but wisdom eludes him. He seeks out the Gotama Buddha, and learns only that wisdom cannot be taught. He turns to what is called  if only in fiction of this sort  the pleasures of the flesh.Siddhartha becomes the lover of the beautiful courtesan Kamala and, at the same time, a successful merchant. But still  are you ready?  he knows he is missing something. He chucks it all and finally, with the aid of an old boatman, he finds what he is seeking in the river as a metaphor of life.These are more or less the highpoints of the story that Mr. Rooks and his cameraman, the usually celebrated Sven Nykvist, have photographed with a kind of photogenic but plodding piety. Mr. Rooks has resisted any temptation to employ the fractured style of his first film, ""Chappaqua,"" and instead has made a small-scale ""Ten Commandments"" for flower children.The Gotama Buddha is photographed from the back or the side, the way Jesus and United States Presidents are photographed in movies in which they have tiny parts. There are lots of shots into the sun, which create halos, and there is one love scene that is mostly between a couple of presumably nude silhouettes. Toward the middle you know Siddhartha is getting fed up with earthly pleasures when, at a banquet, he tosses aside a bunch of grapes.If the film does nothing else, however, it does expose Siddhartha's ultimate wisdom to be nothing much more profound than a technical device. When, as an old man he tells Govinda to look into the river and see the cycle of life, we see what Govinda sees. What is it? Plain old superimposition of images. Heck. D. W. Griffith knew how to do this.",1973-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Undone by morning, as often happens to vampires, he had been reduced to no more than a bag full of bones in the first feeble rays of the smog-filtered Los Angeles sun.Now those bones are made to rise again. Brought back to undeadness through the meddling of a dissident Southern California voodoo priest, Blacula is again condemned to walk the earthin ""Scream Blacula Scream,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion and Juliet II Theaters, and which is not, as the title might suggest, too much fun for anybody.Blacula never asked for his fate anyway. Originally Mamuwalde, a distinguished African prince, he had been bittenand renamedby Count Dracula as long ago as the 18th century. His current incarnations among jive-talking West Coast dudes and their ladies are not greatly to his taste, and despite some involuntary spreading of his habit (he creates at least six new vampires in the first half hour of the movie), his only real interest is to get himself back whereand whenhe came from. To this end he enlists the aid of Lisa, a non-dissident voodoo priestess of high repute (""When it comes to voodoo, Lisa has more natural power than anyone in the last 10 years."")That's really all the movie is about. Mamuwalde's torment, Lisa's efforts, and, of course, the knuckle-headed failure of the local cops to admit that there are vamires among us. And that simply is not enough. Despite all its blood-letting, ""Scream Blacula Scream"" fails for lack of incident, weakness of invention, insufficient story.The director, Bob Kelljan, has at least the shadow of an ideathat the vampire's curse really is a curse, all pain and no pleasure, and is as miserable for the vampire as for his victim. In William Marshall (Mamuwalde) and Pam Grier (Lisa) he has two good performerspowerful, ironic, potentially rather complicated. But he hasn't enough for them to do. It is as if the movie had completed filming without their ever having developed the shooting script.But I'll bet there will be another chance for Blacula. I get that feeling from a movie that determines the only cure for vampires to be a wooden stake through the heartand then leaves its principal antagonist suffering from nothing more than a very pesky chest pain.",1973-07-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"' I Could Never Have...,' Greenburg Film, Opens:The Cast","Dan Greenburg is a very funny writer (""How to Be a Jewish Mother""), and there are some funny lines and bits of business in ""I Could Never Have Sex With Any Man Who Has So Little Regard for My Husband,"" a title so long that it seems intended as a bit of business in itself. It's the sort of movie you're supposed to start laughing at just from seeing the ads. You could also call it a cocktail party movie: it's funnier to be told about than to sit through.There is, for example, a husband's righteous statement: ""I haven't looked at another woman since I've been married. . . . That's 11 months now."" Or there's the darling object someone finds in an antique shop: an ancient picture postcard of a shoe factory sent by a man in Newark to his brother in White Plains. And there's the rationale that comes to a would-be adulterer in his sleep: extramarital sex is no more offensive to God than double-parking.According to this rationale, if we lived in a society in which men wore gloves and women wore earmuffs, the big deal would be getting the earmuffs off.Greenburg's wit is not exactly side-splitting, but it's amusing and cheerful in the fashion of a true anecdote recounted at a neighborhood picnic.The film was directed by Robert McCarty, whose first feature this is, and written by Greenburg, based on his novel ""Chewsday."" It's an East Coast ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" about two couples who spend a horrendous vacation together in a rented house on Martha's Vineyard. Being Greenburg people, they have none of the ersatz chic or flair of their West Coast counterparts. Marvin and Laura and Stanley and Mandy are square. They are nice but they are so square it hurts.In the course of the vacation  mostly rain, cold, fog, cocktail parties and sheer boredomMarvin and Mandy develop a full-sized yen for each other. First it's Mandy who wants to ""do it"" (which is the term they use). Then Marvin wants to do it, and Mandy doesn't. Finally, when their respective mates are out of the house, they decide to give it a try.""I'm used to a lot of foreplay,"" says Mandy. ""They only went antiquing,"" says the desperate Marvin, ""not to Europe!""In this kind of fiction, nobody ever really does do it. In fact, the very idea that they have thought about it ultimately strikes them with terror.

For a few weeks every summer this little German town would be almost a convention center for new music en thusiasts, and avantgarde composers would come from all over the world to pick up the latest devel opments, fraternize with other avantgardists and study with the innovators of the day.

He will use adverbs as nouns, prepositions as adjectives and articles as verbs. He knows all the devices that for a long time now have led the ordinary reader by his expectations to where the pie will hit him squarely in the face.

Anthony Quinn and Franco Nero are the titular heroes who stop Franco Graziosi, as a would-be dictator, from taking Texas from President Sam Houston in 1836. They are ineffectually involved in an ersatz adventure that is neither as explosive or as funny as most movies in the genre it tries to emulate or lampoon.The gimmick here, if you have not already guessed, is Mr. Quinn playing a deaf-mute whose ""ears"" are supplied by his tough sidekick, Mr. Nero. As a veteran movie vaquero, Mr. Quinn is properly saddle-weary and weath-erbeaten in a floppy sombrero and a worn, dusty Prince Albert frock coat. He is also handy with his fists, sticks of dynamite, a Gatling gun and rudimentary sign language. Unfortunately, neither he nor the action has much to communicate to a willing viewer.Mr. Nero, handsome if unshaven, projects an overacted machismo that is pointless, especially when it is channeled toward comedy that rarely registers and Pamela Tiffin is merely naive as a pouting, babyish blond prostitute. ""Deaf Smith & Johnny Ears"" also has a couple of scenes in an ornate bagnio seemingly inspired by Toulouse-Lautrec, but they are no reason to visit this simulation of frontier Texas.",1973-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Huston's 'Mackintosh Man,' Espionage Film, Opens","John Huston's new film, ""The Mackintosh Man,"" is an espionage melodrama torn from the headlines20 years late.It's about a secret agent (Paul Newman), employed by British intelligence to capture a master spy whoit turns out quite early onis an influential Member of Parliament, a law-and-order Tory (played with great charm by James Mason) who rants on about complacency and permissiveness and the ebbing of traditional values.The trap requires a lot of planning (some of it so cryptic as to be intentionally comic), several carefully manufactured false identities, a spectacular prison break and locales that shift from London to Ireland to Malta (though the editing is so odd you may not be immediately aware that a shift has been made).""The Mackintosh Man"" is, technically, an espionage melodrama, but it strikes me more as a memory movie. It's not about memory, heaven knows. Nothing so fashionable. Rather it seems to have been made from memory, recalling, as it does, Burgess and MacLean, the cold war and especially cold war movies, every possible variant on which has already been made, including the post-cold war movie like ""Scorpio"" (about spies who no longer care).The screenplay by Walter Hill, adapted from Desmond Bagley's novel, ""The Freedom Trap,"" has very little to do with character and motivation and everything to do with the incidents and the mechanics of the spy trade. All of which seems to inhibit Huston's talents as a director, as well as those of most of his actors. They must express themselves entirely in terms of physical action and expository dialogue that, here, aim for complexity and arouse only confusion.Part of this confusion may be the result of the soundtrack. Three-quarters of the way through the film I was ready to admit that wax had impaired my hearing. That is, until Dominique Sanda, who also plays an intelligence agent, reading aloud from a newspaper reported that a reception would be held for diplomatic and ""shersh dig-nah-TREES,"" which turned out to be her way of saying ""church dignitaries.""""The Mackintosh Man"" may have you sitting on the edge of your seat from time to time. More often, I suspect, you'll be cupping a hand to an ear.The film opened yesterday at the Loews State 2 and Loews Orpheum theaters.",1973-07-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Badge 373,' With Eddie Egan:Ex-Detective Has Role, but Not of Himself The Cast","As you might guess from the title, ""Badge 373"" is a police melodrama. According to the distributors, Paramount Pictures, it is based on the ""real-life career"" of a former New York City detective, Eddie Egan  whose real-life career has been the basis of movies before this.I suspect it is also based just a bit on some real-life fantasies. Eddie Egan is featured in the movie not as himself  a suspended New York cop named Eddie Ryanbut as a police lieutenantScanlon  who might have been the real-life Eddie's boss. Pete Hamill, the reporter who wrote the screenplay, also shows up. He plays a sympathetic reporter named Pete.These performances, especially the lackluster one by Eddie Egan, provide an aura of amateurishness for ""Badge 373,"" an aura that neither Robert Duvall, as the cop Eddie, nor Verna Bloom, as his girl Maureen, nor Henry Darrow, as the villainous Sweet William, does anything at all to dispel.Sweet William, who may very well be the worst-written role in recent movies, is a Harvard-educated Puerto Rican who quotes Gide; makes his living from whores, drugs and contraband machine guns; and occupies a secret sumptuous book-lined palace hidden inside a wholesale meat plant right on the edge of the Hudson River.This last location introduces an intentional unreality, in contrast to the unintentional unreality of everything else in the movieas if the people who made ""Badge 373"" were unsure whether they wanted to rip off ""The French Connection"" or ""Dr. No.""The former more than the latter, I should think. The movie is full of gratuitous authenticity (the vehicle in its inept big chase sequence is a 14th Street crosstown bus), with fears and prejudices right off the city streets. All the evil is perpetrated by Puerto Ricans, either innocent but violent revolutionaries who run around shouting ""Puerto Rico Libre!"" or the uninnocent but equally violent nonrevolutionaries who manipulate them. Against such forces, Eddie the hard-nosed cop has only the instincts of his personal bigotry to guide him. And invariably the instincts of his personal bigotry turn out to be right.There is absolutely nothing to praise in ""Badge 373""from Howard Koch's helpless direction to the dumpy performances by all the castbut Pete Hamill's screenplay has at least the interest of its overblown prose (Sweet William gets all the lines; nobody else can manage much more than monosyllables) and its curiously devious intentions.At some level, the screenplay means to make use of racial prejudices, expressing them but not endorsing them, and enjoying a free ride through current anxieties that ought to be worth something at the box office. This strategy fails completely. The potential tragedy of conflicting cultures becomes the exploitation of one and the debasement of the other. And unless you care to hate Puerto Ricans (or Irish cops) I don't see how the movie can have anything for you.""Badge 373"" opened yesterday at the Loews State I, Loews Cine and neighborhood theaters.",1973-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Just as few people walk these days if they can ride, so few authors wish to be seen slogging from here to there. Cinematic cuts and shorthand psyches are all the rage. Like the biscuits mother used to bake, the oldfashioned, fullblown, homemade personality is be coming a thing of the past. ",1973-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Tomorrow they open a four game series with the St. Louis Cardinals, who have streaked past them into first place. In their recent history, the Cubs have been unable to regain first place. Three years ago, they wasted a fivegame lead in June, pulled to within percentage points of first place, then lost 13 of their next 25 games.

Meanwhile, the two longestservice CardinalsBob Gibson and Lou Brockare adding impres sively to their career reedits. . . .
