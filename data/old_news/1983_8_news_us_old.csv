All that has changed. Partly, economics have made it practically unthinkable for a straight play to originate on Broadway. But if Broadway is no longer synonymous with the theater in America, that is largely because of the regional theater movement that took root in this country over the last 25 years. That movement has created opportunities for theater artists to live and work in such cities as Atlanta, San Francisco, Chicago, Louisville and Seattle, instead of having to migrate to New York to be where the action is. It has nurtured writers as diverse as Sam Shepard and Beth Henley, David Mamet and Lanford Wilson, Marsha Norman and Charles Fuller. Many of the plays that go to Broadway have originated in one of these regional theaters, and an entire repertory of American drama of merit has sprung up from all over the country, which has made it possible for a play to have a life without ever treading the Great White Way.",1983-08-07T05:00:00+0000

I had been to Ireland once before, in the summer of 1976, and had scooted around the country in a rented car, seeing the usual tourist sights. The place stayed with me like the most vivid of dreams; the landscape, which varies from rugged mountains to placid farmland to stormy seacoast, is lovely beyond description, and the people beguile you with their odd mixture of boisterousness and truculence and mischievousness and vigorous, colorful conversation. In short, I wanted to go back and live for a while in one place. I got the name of a land agent in southwest Cork - a part of the country I hadn't visited - from a friend who lives in London. He himself had been to Schull and he said the area was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen. I wrote to the agent describing what we were looking for - a house or cottage for the month of July with a good view of something or other for about $150 a week.",1983-08-07T05:00:00+0000
us,IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: ATLANTIC BEACH,"SALTY breezes drift almost constantly through the quiet, residential streets and wide boulevards of Atlantic Beach, L.I., a secluded oceanside community of Spanish-style homes and cabana clubs. For years, purveyors of its real estate solicited the business of wealthy New Yorkers with promises of healthful, seasonal living, away from Manhattan. ''At Atlantic Beach, days spin on, a bright and never-pausing wheel in time, evolving what cannot miss becoming the queen of American resorts,'' said an early advertising pamphlet. '' Atlantic Beach is the incarnation of a successful New York at ease and at play.'' Today, Atlantic Beach is a year-round community, within commuting distance of Manhattan and stone's-throw distance of miles of private beaches. ''The ocean, the sand and the quietness of the community, and the fact that there's very little commercialism, make this an ideal village for many New York businessmen,'' said Fred P. Lager, a stockbroker who has been Atlantic Beach's Mayor since its incorporation in 1962. Perched on a narrow spit of land between the sandy, white shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the grassy harbor-ends of Reynolds Channel, Atlantic Beach is a community of about 4,000 year-round residents, according to the 1980 census. It includes four unincorporated areas of single-family homes, called Atlantic Beach Estates, and the incorporated Village of Atlantic Beach. While the Estates and the village are contiguous, the use of the beaches, crucial to the community's appeal, is restricted almost exclusively to village residents and private club members.",1983-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Throughout his short, frenzied and astonishingly prolific life, the Wunderkind of the postwar German film was mesmerized by the figure of Franz Biberkopf, the proletarian protagonist of Alfred D""oblin's ''Berlin Alexanderplatz,'' a novel that enjoys a place in modern German letters akin to Joyce's ''Ulysses.''",1983-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Only 5 percent of Americans visiting Britain chose such an option, the majority staying in conventional accommodations, be they bed and breakfast or the Ritz, or staying with family or friends.By renting a vacation home, and shopping in the village grocery and making excursions to the open-air market in the nearest town, the vacationer inevitably savors more of local life than staying in a resort hotel.

Nevertheless, the dollar continued its surge, closing at a nine- year high against the mark.

The discovery that funds had been embezzled from Columbia Pictures by one of its executives in 1977 ''grew into a dramatic, angry and Machiavellian battle for control of a corporation's destiny,'' Robert Lindsey noted in his review of this best seller. Part soap opera and part detective story, ''Indecent Exposure,'' by David McClintick, formerly a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, reveals the inner operations of a corporation and the way modern Hollywood works, and gives insights about ''how people live and about what they do to one another.'' SOMETHING LIKE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY. By Akira Kurosawa. (Vintage, $6.95.) ''Just the way most moviegoers remember his work - the murky glade in 'Rashomon,' the wake in 'Ikiru,' the plunging horses of 'Kagemusha,' the tired ronin leader of 'Seven Samurai' looking wistfully back at the farmers he has saved - so Akira Kurosawa looks back on his own life in terms of scenes and portraits done with quick brushstrokes,'' Frank Gibney said in his review.

Dershowitz puts the cap of ''definitive'' on ''The Rosenberg File,'' the new book by Ronald Radosh and Joyce Milton about a case that has called forth scores of books and articles in the 30 years since the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for conspiracy to commit espionage. Mr. Radosh and Miss Milton conclude that Julius Rosenberg was a spy, that Ethel Rosenberg knew it and may have assisted him and that the prosecution took liberties with the facts and with legal procedures in its drive for conviction and execution. Definitive though their work may be, it is too much to hope that it will satisfy those who have invested faith and reputation either in the innocence of the Rosenbergs or in the justice of their execution. The case confirms yet again a grim axiom of history: The flames of ideology cannot be subdued by facts.",1983-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,BANKS FINALLY LIFT THEIR PRIME RATE,"The nation's banks finally raised the prime rate to 11 percent from 10 1/2 percent, with Citibank leading the way. It was the first industry-wide increase since February 1982 in the rate banks use to set corporate loans. Though Wall Street had expected the move, the stock and bond markets took a pounding. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 20 points, while bond prices plummeted. The higher prime rate only increased the attractiveness of the dollar to overseas investors, and despite reported intervention by central banks, the dollar continued to climb to new highs against major currencies. There is growing concern among economists that higher interest rates over the last two months will cut short the recovery. Already some Wall Street analysts have scaled back growth projections for the 1983 fourth quarter and 1984 first quarter. But stocks and bonds recovered sharply at week's end. Friday witnessed a strong rally in the bond market, and the Government's long-term bond closed with an 11.71 yield, almost half a percentage point below the highs of the week. The rally was helped by the Federal Reserve's report that the money supply rose $400 million, considerably less than expected. Stocks recovered almost all of their losses from early in the week, closing at 1,182.83.",1983-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Pilgrims and acolytes congregate each afternoon in somber garb (black tie is the only sanctioned uniform) for a service that can consume seven hours, including intermissions for fairly heavy dining. As with all religions, Wagnerism's official dogma is both sacrosanct and yet pliable according to the spirit of the times. Copies of the composer's canonical writings such as ''Mein Leben'' or of his widow's diaries are displayed in every bookstore window. The faithful can recite the librettos word for word, like believers mumbling over their beads. The ''Ring,'' you might think, is chiseled in stone by now. And yet, scribes and pharisees from all over the world regularly gather at the sacred Festspielhaus on Bayreuth's ''green hill'' to ponder the texts and to explicate new hermeneutical interpretations. Bayreuth is the holy city of a devout, vital sect, like Bethlehem or Mecca or Salt Lake City.",1983-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Ryan Jr., special assistant to the Assistant Attorney General: As the investigation of Klaus Barbie has shown, officers of the United States Government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the Government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law. As a direct result of that action, Klaus Barbie did not stand trial in France in 1950; he spent 33 years as a free man and a fugitive from justice, and the fact that he is awaiting trial today in France is due entirely to the persistence of the Government of France and the cooperation of the present Government of Bolivia.",1983-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Thousands of infants had suffered convulsions and brain damage when they were fed commercial formulas lacking essential nutrients. Congress reacted by adopting the Infant Formula Act of 1980, and the Food and Drug Administration promptly proposed stringent rules to enforce the law. In 1981, however, the newly installed Reagan Administration delayed those regulations, studied the matter for 18 months (during which time three million cans of flawed formula were sold) and finally produced a new set of rules. According to Jim Greene, a spokesman for the F.D.A., the new standards meet ''all the requirements needed to protect the consumer.'' According to a staff report prepared for the Oversight Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the new rules ''adopted, virtually in every respect, the suggestions of the infant-formula industry to relax the proposed rules and add 'flexibility.'

He is, of course, Gerard Depardieu, who plays what is apparently the title role in this medieval mystery, and who has by now proven himself to be enormously prolific and changeable. He has played everything from a petty hoodlum (''Loulou'') to a leader of the French Revolution (in Andrzej Wajda's forthcoming ''Danton''), and his screen accomplishments include acts of both heroism and masochism (most notably his self-emasculation in Marco Ferreri's ''Last Woman'').

us,HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE OLDER WORKER,"In the last few weeks, workers between the ages of 65 and 69 have been receiving a blizzard of paperwork from their employers notifying them of a major change in the way health insurance reimbursement programs will operate. The notices stem from legislation intended to cut the Government's Medicare bill. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, in amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Social Security Act, stipulates that Medicare will no longer be the insurer of first resort for older employees. Instead, private insurance plans of employers will pick up medical bills first and then Medicare will pay whatever remaining expenses qualify for coverage. The change, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, is expected to save the Government $1.48 billion through fiscal year 1985 by transferring the primary insurance bill to the private sector. Overall benefits for older employees who continue all of their existing coverage ''generally will not be reduced,'' said Herbert M. Pollock, an official at the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare. But older workers are now faced with key decisions about what health insurance they should carry. For some, the cost of their premiums may rise. The new law requires that employers of 20 or more persons must give older workers, and their spouses age 65 through 69, the option to select several different forms of health coverage. They can choose their employer's private health plan, Medicare Part B (the voluntary part of Medicare) or both.",1983-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The third remark was made by Hugo Fiorato, one of the New York City Ballet's conductors, at this summer's meeting of the Dance Critics Association. Balanchine, said Mr. Fiorato, did not ''just put movements on top of a score, he added a new dimension to it.''",1983-08-28T05:00:00+0000

And the Reagan Administration seemed downright apologetic. At a news conference following the signing ceremony in Moscow, Agriculture Secretary John R. Block (right) described the Carter embargo as ''a distasteful chapter,'' that had hurt American farmers and ''forced'' the Soviet Union into the arms of other suppliers.

In ''Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson,'' a one-hour drama that will be shown tonight on HBO, Laurence Olivier plays a newly widowed Jewish cardboard-box manufacturer in the Bronx. Forget your preconception of how such a man looks and sounds. Olivier believes he looks and sounds like a fussy hairdresser in one of the drearier suburbs of London. He is helped in this conceit by the script, which says that the character he plays did indeed arrive here from London some 40 years ago. On the other hand, Olivier is such a very great actor that it probably doesn't matter. ''Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson'' is an inspired piece of miscasting.",1983-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Rather often, in music at any rate, they can be wonderfully entertaining, like dipping into the Apochrypha. I particularly enjoy the life stories of opera singers and other virtuosos whom I have known, however slightly. These books, which flood out each season, usually make little pretense to objectivity or documentary truth but simply reflect the subject's idealized image of himself or herself. The writers go along, either out of genuine hero worship or out of the fear of being denied access to invaluable historical documents such as old programs and laudatory press clippings. And really, it makes little sense to expect more of these hard-pressed authors than that. Contemporary biography, no matter who practices it, is a hybrid art: part history, part fiction.
