Understated battleship gray, accented with a red lever, black vinyl curtains and colored lights designating party affiliation in primary elections. Overweight at 750 pounds; rolled on casters; often dropped in moving by truckers hired under patronage arrangements. WHY: Because politics is a choice between the lever of two evils. The Shoup is a collateral descendant of the first mechanical voting device, invented just 100 years ago in Lockport, N.Y., by a Rochester safe maker, Jacob H. Myers. He built a 10-by-10-foot room of wood and steel with interlocking doors, to ""protect mechanically the voter from rascaldom, and make the process of casting the ballot perfectly plain, simple and secret.""",1992-11-01T05:00:00+0000

But privateers seized it at sea, and it fell into the hands of the French royal geographer in the 1550's. It was then owned successively by the English anthologists of discoveries Richard Hakluyt and Samuel Purchas and by the antiquary John Selden before it went in 1659 to the Bodleian Library at Oxford, where it lay unstudied for centuries. An edition was published in 1938, but most copies of that were burned in the 1940 German blitz of London. Now Frances F. Berdan of California State University, San Bernardino, and Patricia Rieff Anawalt of the University of California, Los Angeles, have edited the first complete edition, along with commentaries on the codex itself and on the history, geography, science and art of the Aztecs by the editors and six other scholars. The 900-page, four-volume book, in a three-quarters leather binding and slipcased, is a fine example of book design, printing and production, a noble tribute to the Aztec artist who painted the great codex. One large section is unique: a birth-to-death account of Aztec life not dominated by kings, warriors and priests but enlivened by children, women and craftsmen.

Buck struck up a conversation with the captain of a Norwegian cargo boat. We repaired to a bar, where the two men drank whisky and I had a root beer. Buck tried to convince the skipper to take me on as a cabin boy, but since I had no seaman's papers he couldn't do it. His boat was heading down through the Caribbean; its only definite destinations at that point were Pointe-a-Pitre, in Guadeloupe, and Fort-de-France, in Martinique. I don't remember much of what the captain said, but I still recall his remarking on the extraordinary skills of his Colombian crewmen who played soccer on the deck and never once kicked the ball overboard. It was also the first time I had ever heard of Pointe-a-Pitre.",1992-11-01T05:00:00+0000

Aaron's closing round of seven-under-par 64 gave him a total of 15-under 198 and the winner's check of $75,000, his biggest ever. One shot back was Dave Stockton, the second-round leader, who shot a 67. In third was George Archer, who closed with a 66 for a 201 total. The 57-year-old Aaron, who joined the Senior Tour in 1987, lost twice in playoffs earlier this year, once to Mike Hill and once to Archer. Aaron made a 20-foot birdie putt from the fringe on the 18th hole put him a shot ahead of Stockton, who was playing one group behind. Stockton faced a birdie putt of 15 feet on No. 18, but left it just short of the hole.

Stratton appears in ""Ulysses,"" both as himself and as a parody of the prophet Elijah, who shouts black dialect at an unhearing, uncaring God. Mr. Pierce, a senior lecturer in English and related literature at the University College of Ripon and York St. John in York, England, also includes paintings and drawings inspired by Joyce's works (including Joyce's own caricature of Leopold Bloom), photographs of present-day Ireland by Dan Harper, a superb bibliography, a chronology of Joyce's life and times, and thumbnail sketches of important figures in Joyce's life.",1992-11-08T05:00:00+0000

Becker finished off three days of superb tennis that reminded observers of the form that helped him become No. 1 in the world in 1991. In the quarterfinals, Becker, who had won three other tournaments this year but whose ranking had fallen to No. 9, beat the current No. 1 player, Jim Courier. Then the German defeated Goran Ivanisevic, the hottest player on the circuit, in the semifinals. Yesterday, Forget, the defending champion, and Becker had 21 aces each. Becker won $297,000 for his 35th career title; Forget won $159,700. (AP) Seles Captures Ninth Title: Monica Seles, who didn't drop a set all week, used blistering returns to defeat Martina Navratilova, 6-3, 6-4, in the $350,000 Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Calif., as she won her ninth title of the year. Meeting Navratilova in the final of this tournament for the third consecutive year, Seles won for the second time. The world's No. 1 player has established her dominance over Navratilova, 18 years her senior, by winning five of the last seven matches they have played. (AP) GOLF U.S. Edges Sweden Fred Couples and Davis Love 3d both sank birdie putts on the 18th hole yesterday, giving the United States team a one-shot victory over defending champion Sweden in the World Cup of Golf in Madrid. It was a heartbreaking setback for the Swedes, who had taken a two-shot lead to the 17th tee after Per-Ulrik Johansson, who shot a 65, knocked in a 45-foot putt for an eagle on the par-5 16th hole. The putt offset a bogey by Anders Forsbrand, who finished with a 70, and a birdie by Couples, who matched Johansson's 65. But Love hit a 7-iron to 5 feet and then putted out for a birdie on the par-3 17th, reducing the Swedish margin to one, then nailed a pitching wedge to 16 feet on the par-4 18th, while Couples hit a wedge to within 2 feet. Love made his tricky downhill putt to put the pressure on Johansson, who missed for birdie from 7 feet, while Forsbrand saved par after landing his approach in a bunker.(AP) King Surges to Victory: A surprised Betsy King caught Helen Alfredsson with birdies on the last two holes of regulation play, then beat her with another on the fourth playoff hole yesterday in the Mazda Japan Classic in Hanno, Japan, the final Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour event of the year.

Jack McDowell (2-0) of the Chicago White Sox pitched seven innings yesterday. Duane Ward of the Toronto Blue Jays pitched the final two for the save. Playing before 47,000 at Tokyo Dome, Griffey, of the Seattle Mariners, hit a home run with two out in the first inning off Yoichi Okabayashi (0-1) of the Yakult Swallows.

For decades, gay people have swelled the ranks of progressive political movements, albeit outside electoral politics. The peace, civil rights, antinuclear, student, women's and environmental movements all owe much to the energies of gay people. That lesbians and gay men often worked ""in the closet"" in earlier years accounts for why credit may not be placed where due.

us,Graphic Violence,"Posters promoting war and revolution are called paper bullets, because often they are every bit as damaging as conventional ordnance. During the early to middle 20th century, graphic images were the primary propaganda tools of Western nations. Offices and ministries of war information maintained studios with skilled, often well-known artists, devoted to the design of powerful imagery for cautionary and agitational needs. Most governments maintained large archives of their own and their enemies' posters, which were studied and often copied in efforts to achieve the most effective propaganda. One of the most important American collections of visual propaganda is at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, from which PERSUASIVE IMAGES: Posters of War and Revolution From the Hoover Institution Archives (Princeton University, $35) draws its contents, which span the two world wars, the Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War. The authors -- Peter Paret, who teaches in the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study; Beth Irwin Lewis, an adjunct professor of art history at the College of Wooster; and Paul Paret, a former assistant to the curator of 20th-century art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art -- provide background rather than a definitive history of these works, but to display the Hoover Institution's vast holdings is a service to anyone interested in 20th-century propaganda. They reveal a wide range of graphic styles consistent with fashions in painting and commercial art, but there is a chilling redundancy: whatever the national, political, social or ideological root, these posters use the same heinous images and symbols to sell the glory of war.",1992-11-15T05:00:00+0000

The North Stars ended a five-game home stand exactly as they began it: with a shutout victory by Casey. In between, they went 0-2-1. Casey, who faced only four shots in each of the first two periods, earned his 11th career shutout and snapped Chicago's four-game winning streak. Duchesne, who had nine goals last season, scored his sixth of this season 6 minutes 16 seconds into the game. Checked by Steve Larmer as he moved through the slot, Duchesne deflected Russ Courtnall's feed past goalie Ed Belfour. Tinordi scored on his own rebound on a power play 2:04 later.

Felix Potvin, starting his 10th straight game in the Toronto net, stopped 26 shots. He has only allowed six goals in his last five games. Glenn Anderson had two goals for Toronto. Manderville picked up Doug Ellet's rebound off the post and jammed the puck under sprawling Boston goalie Andy Moog at 4:36 of the second as the Leafs won their first game in Boston Garden since Nov. 7, 1987, a span of seven straight losses.

Cheveldae, who shut out the Pittsburgh Penguins by 8-0 on Friday, made 19 saves against the Whalers to extend his shutout streak to 137:37 seconds since giving up a third-period goal against Tampa Bay on Wednesday. He was helped by Detroit's strong defensive play and the Whalers' weak offensive effort. Paul Ysebaert scored both goals to extend the Whalers' streak without a victory to nine games (0-8-1). (AP) Flames 5, Lightning 3: Joe Nieuwendyk scored two third-period goals and goaltender Mike Vernon registered his 200th career victory to lead Calgary in Tampa, Fla. Calgary trailed, 3-2, entering the third period before Nieuwendyk scored the tying goal at 2:35. His game-winner was a slap shot from the top of the circle past Tampa Bay goalie Pat Jablonski at 14:54. The loss stopped the expansion Lightning's four-game winning streak.

A First for Lindros Eric Lindros got his first National Hockey League hat trick as the Flyers won their fourth straight game and extended the Ottawa Senators' losing streak to seven with a 7-2 victory last night at Philadelphia. Just 41 seconds into the game, Lindros gave the Flyers the lead when he put a rebound past Ottawa goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz. Lindros scored again at 7 minutes 37 seconds of the second period off a scramble in front of the net, and got his third goal on a power play at 1:53 of the third period off a pass from Mark Recchi in the slot.

""It was enough to win the match, but it wasn't anything spectacular, not at all,"" said Graf, the 23-year-old German ranked second in the world behind Monica Seles. Graf won $70,000. In addition to taking the $35,000 second-place prize, Sanchez Vicario rose to No. 4 in the ranking, passing Martina Navratilova. Graf's assessment was that of a perfectionist who had just emerged from a 1-hour-40-minute contest against a dogged fighter. Graf had 50 unforced errors to Sanchez Vicario's 41. She only put 71 percent of her first serves into play, compared with 84 percent for Sanchez Vicario.

(AP) GOLF Love's Eagle Does It Davis Love 3d eagled the par-5 18th hole from 40 feet yesterday to break a tie with Mike Hulbert and win the $800,000 Kapalua International golf tournament in Hawaii. Love's final round of six-under-par 67 gave him a total of 15-under 275 and the winner's purse of $150,000. Three times Love has finished second at Kapalua, including last year when Hulbert came from four shots back to catch him in the last round and then beat him with a birdie on the first hole of a playoff. This time Love turned the tables, coming from four shots behind Hulbert, who finished alone in second at 276 after a closing round of 72 on a windy day at the Kapalua Resort's par-73 Plantation Course. In addition to being tied at the end of regulation play last year, Love and Hulbert were deadlocked again atop the leader board after this year's first round. At the end of two rounds, they were still tied, this time one shot off the pace. And yesterday, with only one hole to go, they were tied again after Hulbert birdied No. 17.

Davydov, who joined the Jets late last season after winning an Olympic gold medal with the Unified Team, finished off his hat trick at 15:48 of the second period. (AP) Penguins 4, Sabres 2: Rick Tocchet scored twice and N.H.L. scoring leader Mario Lemieux had his 23d goal as Pittsburgh extended its home unbeaten streak to 19 games. The Penguins are 17-0-2 at the Civic Arena in regular-season games since losing, 8-4, to Hartford last Feb. 27. Lemieux has at least one goal in 18 of Pittsburgh's 20 games this season. Red Wings 5, Blackhawks 4: Shawn Burr's tie-breaking goal with 6:40 left gave Detroit the comeback victory over visiting Chicago. Detroit trailed, 3-0, after one period, and by 4-2 after two, but scored three straight goals in the last 20 minutes. Burr scored the winner from a nearly impossible angle, bouncing his shot off goaltender Ed Belfour and into the net for his third goal. (AP) Canadiens 5, Senators 3: Visiting Montreal scored three goals in the second period to deflate Ottawa, avenging an opening-night loss to the first-year Senators. It was the second night in a row the league-leading Canadiens used a second-period rally to climb out of a hole. Montreal scored five times to overcome Boston's 3-0 lead in Monday's 6-3 victory. Ottawa is now 0-17-1 in 18 games since its season-opening 5-3 victory over Montreal on Oct. 8. (AP) Nordiques 3, Maple Leafs 1: Ron Hextall made 32 saves as Quebec defeated Toronto in a game played in Hamilton, Ontario. Joe Sakic, Steve Duchesne and Mats Sundin scored Quebec's goals. Nikolai Borschevsky scored for the Maple Leafs, who lost for the first time in six games. (AP) INDOOR SOCCER United States Defeats Russia Jeff Agoos and Chico Borja of Belleville, N.J., scored two goals each as the United States beat Russia, 8-3, last night in its opening match of the FIFA world indoor championship in Hong Kong. The United States, which finished third in 1989 in the first world indoor tournament, took a 3-0 halftime lead on Fernando Clavijo's goal in the fifth minute, Agoos's goal in the 14th and Borja's goal one minute later. Second-half goals by Agoos, Terry Woodberry, George Fernandez and Borja made it a seven-goal lead before Russia closed to 7-3. In the other Group D match, Spain beat China, 6-2. Argentina and Poland advanced to the quarterfinals in Group A. Argentina beat Hong Kong, 2-1, while Poland beat Nigeria, 5-4. (AP)",1992-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Brian Bradley's unassisted goal foiled Casey's bid for the 12th shutout of his career. Bradley directed the puck through Casey's legs while falling down to extend his consecutive-point streak to 10 games. Casey finished with 38 saves. Minnesota improved to 10-8-2 over all and improved its Norris Division-best road record to 5-5. (AP) Jets 5, Red Wings 3: Rob Murray scored his first goal in three seasons to break a third-period tie and give Winnipeg the victory over the Red Wings in Detroit.

(AP) Nordiques 4, Canadiens 3: Joe Sakic scored a goal and set up two more, recording his 400th career point, as Quebec rallied to defeat Montreal in Quebec.

(AP) Flames 4, Canucks 3: Joe Nieuwendyk and Theoren Fleury scored within a 46-second span of the second period, leading Calgary to the victory over visiting Vancouver.

Red Wings Stage Rally The Detroit Red Wings scored three goals in a 4-minute-16-second span in the third period to overcome a two-goal deficit and beat the slumping Washington Capitals, 7-5, last night in Landover, Md. Mike Ridley's second goal of the night had given Washington a 5-3 lead with 11 minutes 13 seconds left in the period. But Steve Yzerman got his 16th goal on a 40-foot slap shot with 8:01 left, and Sheldon Kennedy tied it on a shot in the slot off a pass from Mike Sillinger with 4:27 remaining.

Peter Bondra also scored two goals for the Capitals, who have lost four straight. Washington blew a two-goal lead in the third period of its last game, against Minnesota. Washington goaltender Don Beaupre, the victim of the Detroit comeback, hasn't won since Oct. 17, the last time Washington won at the Capital Centre. Beaupre has dropped six straight decisions.

Motion Pictures","Separating the dancer from the dance has been Lois Greenfield's goal for the past 10 years.

The results can be seen in BREAKING BOUNDS: The Dance Photography of Lois Greenfield (Chronicle, cloth, $35; paper, $22.95), collected by William A. Ewing, the author of ""The Fugitive Gesture: Masterpieces of Dance Photography."" Ms. Greenfield's playful black-and-white images celebrate pure kinetic energy. Working with dancers from companies like Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane, Feld Ballets/N.Y. and Iso Dance, the photographer captures the tension and exuberance of the human body in motion. There are elegant, witty shots, like the one of Daniel Ezralow hoisting a baby in one hand with his leg extended in an arabesque or the startling image of David Parsons hovering in the air over a sinuous Denise Roberts. Ms. Greenfield is at her most effective when working with one or two dancers. When she turns her lens on ensembles, she fails to capture a company's distinctive personality.

The 10-birdie blitz over the 6,667-yard Concord Golf Club course marked a strong turnaround for the 33-year-old Australian. A month ago, he took two weeks off from the tour because of poor play. Harwood started six shots behind his fellow Australians Parry and McWhinney, the second-round leaders, and finished with a 54-hole total of 201, 12 under. But Parry and McWhinney each had his third straight 67 to match Harwood's total. Four shots back of that trio were an American, John Morse, the first-round leader who had a 69 yesterday, and two Australians, David Iwasaki-Smith and Bradley Hughes. (AP) Barrett Beats Ammaccapane: Tina Barrett shot a women's course record of 69 at Troon North in Scottsdale, Ariz., to win the $200,000 Mitsubishi Motors Invitational Pro-Am golf championship by two strokes. Barrett, who played the last 10 holes at three under, finished with a 54-hole total of 214, two under par. The victory was worth $25,000 in the non-tour event that drew a field of 44 L.P.G.A. Tour pros. Danielle Ammaccapane, who won the title last year and led until finishing with two bogeys, had a final-round 71 and earned $15,000 for second place at even-par 216. (AP) SOCCER Leeds Defeats Arsenal The defending champion, Leeds United, overpowered Arsenal, 3-0, yesterday to end a seven-game streak without a victory and end the Gunners' winning streak at six in England's Premier League. Leeds got second-half goals from Chris Fairclough, Lee Chapman and Gary McAllister. Norwich edged Sheffield United, 2-1, to increase its lead over second-place Arsenal to 4 points. (AP) SPEED SKATING Blair Coasts to Two Victories Bonnie Blair, a double Olympic gold-medal winner, coasted to easy victories in the 500 and 1,000-meter speed-skating races at a meet in Oslo yesterday. Blair, from Champaign, Ill., was timed in 42.34 seconds in the sprint race at the Valle Hovin oval, beating the runner-up, Edel Therese Hoiseth of Norway, by 37 hundredths of a second. In the 1,000, Blair's winning time was 1 minute 27.61 seconds. Marte Mari Nordby of Norway was a distant second in 1:34.32. Blair won both events early this year at Albertville, France, becoming the first American woman since the Alpine skier Andrea Mead in 1952 to win two golds in one Winter Olympics.

A1 Germany's strategy on global trade now: Silence. A6 MORE FOREIGNERS' BLOOD IS SHED A woman and two girls of Turkish nationality were killed by a firebomb in Germany's deadliest violence against foreigners in three years. Neo-Nazis were blamed. A1 ALLIANCE SUBDUES TURKISH KURDS Turkey's Army, in an unlikely alliance with Kurds in northern Iraq, has won a series of important battles against a group of Turkish Kurds who are fighting to establish an independent nation. A1 YELSTIN REASSURES MILITARY In an apparent attempt to reassure troops, Russia's President vowed to raise spending on military arms and equipment while keeping defense spending at current levels. A3 BOSNIAN TIDE TURNS Attacks on Travnik and the surrounding area have U.N. officials worried that Serbian forces have new battle plans that go beyond the earlier territorial objectives. A3 PERU'S AID STILL IN QUESTION Peru's elections, which apparently gave President Fujimori's candidates an majority, were certified free of fraud by observers, but that was no assurance that aid cut off earlier this year would resume. A5 NO PEACE IN ISRAEL DURING RECESS Peace talks are not synonymous with peace in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Violence continues to hit Israel while the talks are in a holding pattern. A9 Beijing Journal: ""Yellow cows"" grow fat on capitalist pastures.

A11 A FIZZLING CHALLENGE? Many members of Congress won election this year with promises to challenge the system in Washington. But if the turnout at a meeting for new lawmakers is any indication, few have the will to follow through on those pledges. A11 ON THE TRAIL, AGAIN Clinton was back on the campaign trail -- this time for a Georgia Senator struggling to win a runoff race. After three weeks of transition business, Clinton appeared to enjoy reprising his familiar role as campaigner. A13 A Republican challenger has a surprising chance in Georgia. A13 Former Senator Paul Tsongas undergoes a biopsy. A13 GUIDELINES ON ELDERLY The American Medical Association suggested that doctors routinely ask older patients about abusive or neglectful behavior. The group cited estimates that two million older Americans a year are mistreated.

The victory kept alive Nebraska's shot at a Big Eight title. The Cornhuskers (8-2 over all and 5-1 in the Big Eight) will go to the Orange Bowl as conference champions if they beat Kansas State next weekend in Japan. Otherwise, Colorado will go to the Orange Bowl. Oklahoma (5-4-2, 3-2-2) dominated the game early, then was run over by the Cornhuskers and closed out its worst season since going 3-7 in 1965. Jones scored on fourth-quarter runs of 14 and 2 yards. (AP) Arkansas Beats L.S.U.: Barry Lunney Jr. threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Ron Dickerson Jr. and E. D.

Dickerson -- with his father, Ron Sr., the new Temple coach, in the stands -- scored with 10:29 left in the third quarter to put Arkansas on top, 16-0.

Life in a Worn-Out Valley","Wendy Ewald went to Colombia in 1982 on a Fulbright fellowship to teach in the small Andean town of Raquira. She spent two years photographing the town, and encouraged her students to do the same. MAGIC EYES: Scenes From an Andean Childhood (Bay Press, 155 West Denny Way, Seattle, Wash. 98119, paper, $18.95) combines photographs taken by Ms. Ewald and her students with the stories of Maria Vasquez and her 28-year-old daughter, Alicia, two women Ms. Ewald met in Raquira. Alicia recounts a childhood spent living in the mountains with her grandparents, a childhood full of curses and magic, especially the power of the evil eye. As a young child she helped to harvest coffee. But the ""worn-out valley . . . coughs up its young people -- the ones who make the progress -- to the city,"" and so Maria took Alicia to the slums of Bogota, a 26-hour bus ride away. The two women's lives are filled with violent, unreliable men, women who keep their families together with little or no education or resources, and children who learn early ""a lot about justice and injustice."" Deep-toned, almost sepia, the photographs -- such as views of the barrio, a dresser piled high with possessions, hands clasping a rosary -- combine Ms. Ewald's vision with those of her fifth-grade students, who took two-thirds of the shots, and convey a richness and dignity to the simplest objects.

One of its most exquisite products was the elaborately dyed and embroidered kosode, or short-sleeved robe, similar to the modern-day kimono. WHEN ART BECAME FASHION: Kosode in Edo-Period Japan (Weatherhill, 421 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017, $60), with pages of color photos of kosode, is a companion book to an exhibit of some 150 of these garments at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; it was written by two of the museum's curators, Dale Carolyn Gluckman and Sharon Sadako Takeda, with additional contributions by seven scholars. The Edo Japanese expressed their individual style not in the cut of their clothing, as in the West, but through their choice of surface decoration. Sumptuary laws, meant to regulate extravagant dress, in fact encouraged alternative design and dyeing techniques for kosode, making it the designer clothing of the age. Because the Japanese made no distinction between fine art and decorative art, the great artists of the day used kosode as their painting surfaces, creating robes that became supreme status symbols. Wordplay, Chinese pictograph characters and even poetry were incorporated into kosode design as well, creating what Ms. Takeda calls ""a cloak of language that announced the sensibilities, desires and values of the owner."" Perhaps this is the precedent for the often inscrutable English one sees on T-shirts, jackets and shopping bags in today's Japan.",1992-11-29T05:00:00+0000

He scored the first World Cup giant slalom victory of his career and he beat Alberto Tomba of Italy in front of the superstar's adoring fans. ""For the first time in my life I beat Tomba, and I am overjoyed,"" said the 21-year-old from Oslo, the 1992 Olympic super giant slalom champion. His only previous World Cup victory was in a Super-G -- a speed race -- last season in Aspen, Colo. Aamodt, whose career has been plagued by injuries and mononucleosis, skied two faultless runs down the Kandahar-Borgata course. His total time of 1 minute 48.34 seconds beat Tomba by 0.47 seconds. Tomba, supported by a crowd of 20,000 enthusiastic fans, trailed Aamodt by only one-hundredth of a second in the first run but was outrun badly in the second heat. (AP) Maier Wins Giant Slalom Race: Ulrike Maier of Austria, twice a world champion but never the winner of a World Cup race, ended years of frustration by capturing the season-opening women's giant slalom yesterday in Park City, Utah. Maier, who won super giant slalom gold medals in world championship competitions in 1989 at Vail, Colo., and in 1991 in Saalbach, Austria, completed two trips down the 4,200-foot course in 2 minutes 21.87 seconds, .23 faster than Carole Merle of France, the defending World Cup giant slalom champion.

Although there is plenty of humor -- a photograph of a plucked chicken on a bed is titled ""Reclining Nude"" -- it doesn't hide Mr. Vinz's message: that optimism exists in the face of tough times, quiet confusion, bad decisions and the tacit understanding that ""nothing much will happen."" The Red River may disappoint visitors by being a ""stubborn, sluggish, silty stream / that loops its way the wrong direction, / north""; a fisherman being photographed with a 12-pound northern pike may be ""someone like someone you've probably met, / trying hard to be proud and bold / about a kind of gift he doesn't know / just whom, or how, to give.""
