Clive Barnes Robert Marasco has written a wonderfully powerful melodrama that will thrill audiences for a long time to come. Nor is it simply a melodrama, for his theme of the encroach ment of evil is a serious one, and from the first moment to the last the play is immersed in a strange, at first puzzling. atmosphere. Never for a moment does Mr. Marasco lose his grip on the atten tion, and as the mys tery is chillingly unraveled, he produces one stroke after another of genuine Grand Guignol horror. This is one of the most sat isfying scary shows in years. Joseph Hardy has staged it with a stealthy deftness for the atmo sphere and a healthy re gard for the dramatic form. The cast is beautiful clearly delighted in hav ing an actors play in its hands and giving it for all it is worth. Pat Hingle and Fritz Weaver are both ex traordinarily good. Ken Howard portrays the nice, blond allAmerican kid most affectingly. A good night  indeed a dark good night.

us,Screen: 'The Only Game':Major Stars Converge on a Minor Script,"""THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse and other theaters around town, is the first film to be directed by George Stevens since ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965). It is Warren Beatty's first film since ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967) and Elizabeth Taylor's ninth since ""Cleopatra"" (1963). Assigning those three to the film version of Frank D. Gilroy's small, sentimental, Broadway flop is rather like trying to outfit a leaky Central Park rowboat for a celebrity cruise through the Greek islands. The result is a phenomenological disaster.Fran is an emotionally bruised Las Vegas showgirlwhen she was 10, her father ran away from home. As played by Miss Taylor, Fran is so top-heavy in bouffant hair styles by Alexandre of Paris, and badly proportioned minidresses by Mia Fonssagrives, that she has the non-dancing silhouette of an apple balanced atop a pair of toothpicks. Joe (Beatty), who fakes a terrible cocktail piano and is a compulsive gambler, shares Fran's flat because Fran doesn't like to smoke in bed alone.They make love, talk endlessly, saying things like ""Don't tease me. I don't like being teased"" or ""That's the first time I've seen you laugh,"" but they cannot admit they love each other. This is in spite of the fact that both stars have personalities only slightly less vulnerable than a roulette wheel's. Nothing in ""The Only Game in Town"" seems quite on the up and up. Everything, includ-both the humor and the pathos, is bogus.To establish Miss Taylor's means of making a living, Stevens gives us a nice long-shot of a line of Las Vegas showgirls, then cuts to a tight closeup of the actress's face, bouncing up and down as if the rest of her were on an exercycle. Miss Taylor's face is still one of the great scenic attractions of our time, but the performance is awfully royal. Beatty, who can be an interesting actor, is required to deliver breezy, bad comedy lines that have the effect of making him look and act like George Hamilton.Stevens's treatment of the romantic but not necessarily dishonest script is epic. Time passes in lap dissolves that are so long and portentious that one fully expects an army to materialize, instead of a head against a pillow. When Miss Taylor stands at her Las Vegas picture window at dawn, a 707 roars by, sounding like a hound of heaven. It's almost as if Stevens had decided to make ""Vivacious Lady"" (1938) in the manner of ""A Place in the Sun"" (1951).At one point to the film, when Beatty goes off on a manic gambling spree, there are hints that the soul of the character, and of the film, contain dark, unexplored corners.

us,Screen: Hero in a Hurry:George Segal Stars in Kershner's 'Loving',"IRVIN KERSHNER (""A Fine Madness,"" ""The Luck of Ginger Coffey"") seems to specialize in directing movies about men who have to rush to keep up with themselves. In his best film so far, ""Loving,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous and Loew's New Cin, he has not only a hero in a hurry, but also an actor who while he runs can react with precision, depth and endless good sense.""Loving"" isn't only George Segal's movie. There is nobody in the very large supporting cast I should want to fault. But its world is so greatly an extension of the character Segal creates that I cannot happily imagine the film without him.Segal plays a commercial artist with wife (wonderful Eva Marie Saint) and kids in Westport, and mistress and contacts in New York. He is in the midst of losing his mistress, winning a major account, acquiring a new house, keeping up appearances, satisfying his desires, pleasing clients, asserting his independenceand somehow keeping at bay the success that seems in danger of settling the precarious imbalance of his life.It is a comic situation, being, like most comedy, a few footnotes to the course of human misery. Segal's particular brand of despair; his completeness, rather than brilliance, as an actor (he occasionally throws away good lines, but he always redeems the bad ones); his body's energy and his face's mobility; his ability not simply to move but to inhabit the space in which he movesconstitute a superior method of interpreting the ordinary world.In a sense, the very banality of the film's anecdote allows George Segal the fullest scope for his intelligencejust as it forces Irvin Kershner's attention for once to upper middle-class normality, with greatly satisfying results.""Loving"" is wholly a New York (or, more accurately, greater metropolitan area) movie. Like the best New York movies, it is strong on realitynot local color, but localized attitudes and occupations, To his everlasting glory, Kershner never condescends toward the profession of commercial art, but, instead, understands it as effort, anxiety and independence  as the essence of self-employment and not as personal sellout. The film ultimately reveals less about suburban morals, its advertised subject, than about the morality of making do, its real subject. It succeeds beautifully with the details of how we live, and fails only in the forced mechanics of its major scenes.The giant Fairfield County cocktail party that climaxes ""Loving,"" and in which the all-seeing eye of closed-circuit television exposes Segal in a multiple sexual betrayal more comic than cataclysmic, is neither as funny nor as painful as it should be.The fault lies partly with the hero, whose life is supposed to fall in shambles, but who, like other Irvin Kershner failures, is essentially a success. But it lies also with the construction of the sequence  too obvious, too repetitious, even too sloppy to convey the sense of inexorable coincidence that is the soul of this kind of fiction.I suspect insensitive, or merely expeditious editing, which in many places subverts the film's graceful advances and lovely dislocations of mood. For in the direction of actors, judgment about scenes, and everything that happens in the camera, ""Loving"" is a fine and gratifying film.",1970-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: Multi-Plot, Multi-Star 'Airport' Opens:Lancaster and Martin in Principal Roles Adaptation of Hailey's Novel at Music Hall","""AIRPORT,"" the film version of Arthur Hailey's novel, is the sort of movie most people mean when they say Hollywood doesn't make movies the way it used to. This isn't just because ""Airport"" resembles any number of old ""Grand Hotel"" movies. Rather it's because it evokes our nostalgic feelings, not only for the innocence of old movies but also for the innocent old times in which we saw them.Here is a film, made in the space age, in which the sight of an elderly nun guzzling an ounce of brandy is meant to bring an indulgent chuckle and in which intellectualism, in the person of a smart aleck, sissy kid is told off by the forces of common sense, in the person of Dean Martin. ""Airport"" has an interior clock that came to a stop  I'd estimate  about 1939.This is not surprising, considering the fact that it was produced by Ross Hunter (""Magnificent Obsession,"" ""Imitation of Life""), a man who has devoted his entire career to stopping clocks, and written and directed by George Seaton (""Miracle on 34th Street,"" Teacher's Pet""), a man who has a positive genius for disguising old clocks so that they look brand new.I've not read the novel, but I'm told by those who have that Seaton has managed to retain most of the characters and crises (and even, heaven help us, some of the dialogue) with which Hailey dramatized what was presented as an ordinary night at a large Middle Western airport.In the course of this ordinary night: airport operations are complicated by the worst blizzard of the year; a mad bomber, holding a one-way ticket, embarks on a non-stop flight for Rome; a cute little old-lady stowaway is captured; Mel, the airport manager, is promised a divorce that frees him to marry Tanya, head of guest relations; Vern, the married pilot, must decide what he'll do about Gwen, the stewardess carrying his seed; a plane is stalled on a key runway, and a group of angry suburbanites is picketing for noise abatement when they might better worry about snow removal.Seaton has made all this so superficially contemporary (he uses split-screens to the point when I feared I was becoming wall-eyed), so breathlessly paced, so cheery, so chock-full of irrelevant facts, that ""Airport"" eventually comes to look and sound like the world's first 137-minute, 70-millimeter television commercial, with short, regular interruptions for entertainment. The product being sold is the Boeing 707. ""Take the wings off her,"" says the pitchman, ""and you can use her as a tank."" The cost, complete with wings: $8-million.The cast includes a large number of familiar actors, some good, some bad, most of whom are upgraded by being given billing equal to Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, who really are movie stars. Most prominent are Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bisset, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton, and ""Miss Helen Hayes,"" who plays the stowaway with such outrageous abandon you believe she must have honestly thought it would be her last performance. (The ""Miss"" billing, of course, is Hollywood's modest way of calling attention to its Dames.)""Airport,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is an immensely silly filmand it will probably entertain millions of people who no longer care very much about movies.",1970-03-06T05:00:00+0000

You'll also have to look hard to recognize Franco Nero, in the title role of a foppish, money-minded expert with guns who hires himself out to a band of disorganized rebels during the Mexican Revolution. Swathed in a ragged beard and sideburns, peering out from under a wide-brimmed hat and ambling through the picture in a long, hanging coat, he's come a long way from ""Camelot"" and the dashing Lancelot.The color picture is a shapeless, rambling affair, partly dubbed in English, and partly spoken sepulchrally by Nero, who looks completely lost as a gun toter, and ""guest star"" Jack Palance, who looks for all the world like an aging female impersonator, with his frizzled hair and slack-jawed posturing.The picture does churn, but foolishly, with slam-bang battles and mop-ups that at times suggest that the director and scenarists simply gave up and let the story slide into farce. One ready, willing and able performance almost manages to cut through persuasively, that of Tony Musante, as the rugged but unimaginative rebel leader taken in hand and later victimized by Nero. The comely Giovanna Ralli also could do better with more, and has.But watching Nero astride a horse down Mexico way (in Spain), some viewers may wonder how he ever kept his balance on the hoof in ""Camelot,"" with all that 10-ton armor.",1970-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Jenny' Arrives:Marlo Thomas Stars With Alan Alda,"SHE conceives the baby at a drive-in, while on the screen in front of the car Montgomery Clift pledges summer-long fealty to Elizabeth Taylor in ""A Place in the Sun."" Jenny loves revivals. When she meets the man she's going to marry, he is making movies in Central Park. She explains her solitary pregnancy with a story about the death of her husband the filmmaker: He fell 35 stories while doing a documentary, and when they found him he was still clutching his camera.Delano (named for F.D.R.), played by Alan Alda, marries her for their mutual conveniencemostly his; expectant fathers escape the draft. On their wedding night, he sits smoking pot and giggling like an idiot into a copy of Sight and Sound. She wonders if it would be pretentious of them to call the baby ""Jean-Luc,"" with the observation that the name would do as well for a boy or a girl.She suggests he film the birth, and he refuses. But many heartbeats and a few crises later they do come firmly togetherwith the aid of the corniest rapture-of-we-two-together sequences since ""A Man and a Woman."" And before the final white-out, Jenny has let fall from her left eye a single big fat tear that (though Marlo Thomas will never replace Ingrid Bergman, at least in my silver memory book) surely signifies she has at last become the movie she has always longed to be.The girl Miss Thomas plays, Jenny, has many characterises, but not, in the dramatic sense, much character. And the way Miss Thomas plays her tends not so much toward the perfection of a role as toward the presentation of a personality.I don't mean that it is an indulgent or self-aggrandizing performance. Miss Thomas is the soul of tact. She generally keeps to herself in spite of the most shameless opportunities for emotional display. But again and again the camera moves in for those throat-catching close-ups (some of them apparently soft-focus, some of them not; the disparity is disconcerting) that allow less for Jenny's reaction to her situation than for our reaction to Marlo Thomas.""Jenny"" is a very old-fashioned film, gently accumulating the paraphernalia of a certain opportune modernism. All the movie memories are intellectual properties of a sort that you may discard if you wish to sigh over the sad-happy story of a girl and her guy and her baby.But it isn't so easy to make old-fashioned movies now, and the values and life-styles the film plays with, keep playing with it in returnso that ""Jenny"" often stumbles into (and alas, out of) a better kind of movie than it has any right to be.Everybody in the cast, the director, and the writers do well in that other, better, movie. Among the supporting actors, Marian Hailey as Delano's girlfriend and Vincent Gardenia as Jenny's father never leave it. (Gardenia portrays a small-town, conventionally patriotic, conventionally neo-fascist middle-aged good citizen with quietly chilling but affectionate accuracy.)George Bloomfield proves himself a temperate ungimmicky director of reasonable situations (I except the several passages of forced lyricism and psychological insightwhich nobody could have directed). And the screenplay keeps producing small sharp surprises.For example, a Greenwich Village lady sees Jenny pregnant and solicitously asks her, ""So what's it going to benatural or regular?"" And when Jenny and Delano get married, a two-second scene, the official face on the wall of the marriage bureau is a photograph (I'm sure Bloomfield knew the effect he was producing here) of Richard Nixon.",1970-03-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Furie's 'The Lawyer' Arrives:Murder Movie Shifts Spotlight to Counsel Sutton and Trans-Lux West Show Picture,"THE opening shot is a tight close-up of the face of a young man who seems momentarily trapped. The eyes are a little too small for the nose, which is a little too large for the face, which is obviously a mask for a restless mind. When the camera pulls back, it's apparent that Tony Petrocelli (Barry Newman) has been standing at a urinal  which pretty much defines the world with which Sidney J. Furie, the director, ""surrounds the hustling title character in ""The Lawyer.""This is the America of transistor radios, of fatuous TV newscasters, of cheap hard booze and warm soft drinks, of automobiles carelessly accelerated and braked into premature obsolescence, of flags always seen as symbols of irony. Tony, who drives a camper truck, and his wife live in a trailer parked on a hill outside of town. He's a guy dedicated to mobility, preferably upward.The Canadian-born Furie is himself a kind of flashy, hit-and-run director (""The Leather Boys,"" ""The Ipcress File""), sometimes great at ""capturing the essence of small, meaningful moments but often careless about revealing the ultimate point of them. ""The Lawyer,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton and Trans-Lux West Theaters, thus is most interesting as the movie that Brad Dexter, its producer, announced he was going to make several years ago as ""The Sam Sheppard Story.""Originally the film was to be based on the transcripts of the two trials, as well as on the autobiography, of Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard, the Cleveland osteopath for whom F. Lee Bailey, the Boston criminal lawyer, finally won acquittal from a charge that Sheppard had murdered his wife. One of the two most enduring, if not most sensational, aspects of the Sheppard case was the United States Supreme Court's reversal of the initial conviction on the grounds that publicity before and during the trial had prejudiced the jury.The other was the emergence of Bailey as a national celebrity, a television personality and the defender of well-publicized lost causes like those of the so-called Boston Strangler and Dr. Carl Coppolino. Overnight Bailey became a kind of Clarence Darrow in a Lear jet.For reasons at which I can only guess, Dexter, Furie and Harold Buchman (who collaborated on the script with Furie) eventually abandoned the idea of dramatizing the actual Sheppard case and decided instead to do a film about a tough, ambitious criminal lawyer defending a case rather like Sheppard's In a way, I suppose, the decision was wise. The two trials were short on revelation (except of the fact that the case against the doctor was completely circumstantial). Also, the turn taken by subsequent events rendered Dr. Sheppard an unlikely bet as a romantic movie hero.The resulting film, now set in what I take to be a small, prosperous North Dakota community that has palm trees and bigoted cops who call everyone ""boy,"" gets hung up somewhere between its fact and its fiction.The courtroom drama is nicely if conventionally acted by Newman and Harry Gould (the district attorney), with much putting on and taking off of glasses, swapping of Life-Savers and picking of teeth. It lacks, however, the sort of counterpointing of (revelation against reversal that makes courtroom drama endurable, at least for me. As a substitute for suspense, The Lawyer"" presents several possible solutions to the crime, only one of which (the one dramatizing the doctor as guilty) seems at all feasible.The film as somewhat more interesting in describing the lawyer, but it treats him almost entirely in terms of the second-rate milieu that Furie photographs so lovingly, in terms of a perfectly understandable lust for his wife (Diana Muldaur), and in terms of a final comment to the effect he couldn't care less about his client's guilt or innocence, only his acquittal.""The Lawyer"" looks bleak, but it's not especially tough.",1970-03-11T05:00:00+0000

In manner and feeling, it recalls the febrile luxury of the 3 P.M. movie on Saturday television, while everybody else is out ruining his mind with team sports, fresh air and sunshine.Then something terrible happens. The scientific expedition under the leadership of icy but glamorous Dr. Sybil Greame (Susan Clark) finds not only the fossil missing links it was looking for, but also living missing linksa community of monkey people who throw flowers for friendship, seem human (""Look! They laugh!"" exclaims an expedition member) and furnish the movie with a handy symbol of man's misuse of man from the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution until last week. And what had been acceptably awful becomes unacceptably awful, as ""Skullduggery"" stumbles up to the histrionics of Hollywood humanism.The thickening in the immensely complicated and utterly unimportant plot is provided by the ""Tropis,"" who have short bodies, long body hair, human faces, and prehensile feet. The females wear beards and, I believe, lipstick. A male, when dressed in a red cap, looks wonderfully like Harpo Marx. But after the question of their humanity comes up (in a climactic trial sequence) all characterization is lost in generalization, and funky charm of primeval gives way before the dim exercise of what the forces behind ""Skullduggery"" seem to think is the liberal imagination. They even drag in Black Panthers, to prove that Tropis are white, but (a double betrayal) they call them ""Black Humanists.""From time to time the dialogue produces a gleam of wit unearned by Gordon Douglas's dull direction. Susan Clark has an elegant manner and a pleasing face that suggests she could actually hold the Ph.D. her roles seem always to credit her with.The Tropis are played by a specially selected group from the University of Djakarta, Indonesia (""Skullduggery"" was filmed in Jamaica, so you can see the logic) who might better have spent their time in class or in student riots.",1970-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Romance Reigns:'Love Is a Funny Thing' Directed by Lelouch,"IN the bad old days movies were very glamorous. Alarmed observers noting that life lacked glamor, often deplored this quality in the movies, thinking Hollywood tinsel less real than everyday grime. Eventually, changing times, tastes, and truths deglamorized the movies, and nowadays, almost any actress you notice on the street will look better than in her latest film.Certain pockets of active resistance remain, perhaps the best of them in France, where Jacques Demy created a musical masterpiece (""The Young Girls of Rochefort"") in a town he painted white, pink and powder blue, and where Claude Lelouch, at least since ""A Man and a Woman"" (1966), has been asserting love, raindrops and the spirit of the ""Warsaw Concerto.""As one who hated ""A Man and a Woman,"" I am almost embarrassed to admit that, with reservations, I liked Lelouch's latest movie, ""Love Is a Funny Thing,"" now playing at the Festival Theater, very much. Dully repetitive in spots, with few ambitions beyond the evocation of a certain mood of ironic hopefulness, ""Love Is a Funny Thing"" nevertheless succeeds in making a restatement of romance that just at this moment seems a bold thing to have done.It concerns a mature love affair between a French actress (Annie Girardot) and a composer (Jean-Paul Belmondo) working together on a movie in Los Angeles. Both are married, but they share the language barrier, and a civilized boredom with deep-sea fishingand they sleep together and, when their assignments are finished; they take off for Las Vegas and points southwest. Most of the film is set in this locale, and the general effect is not so much the oddness of, say, a pair of French lovers in Monument Valley, as it is of the normalcy and decency of Lelouch's view of a tourist's America.An air of practical intelligence and good feeling suffuses ""Love Is a Funny Thing"" and saves it even from the bathos of its most worn devices. ""A bit commercialbut all right,"" says the American director to Belmondo about the movie he is making. He could have been describing the movie he is in.The line between the two movies is never clearly drawn. Lelouch actually promotes a degree of confusion, so that in the final scenes when he makes life imitate the movies, he has already provided an image for comparison, and we are free to appreciate its subtlety, no matter what its status as clich. In fact, those final scenes, an anxious airport wait, constitute a very beautiful revaluation of romantic movie commonplaces.I can't imagine ""Love Is a Funny Thing"" deprived of its starswithout its degenerating into something very like ""A Man and a Woman."" Belmondo plays for gentleness and lively good sense, and he has never been more attractive. As for Anne Girardot, a superb and supremely direct actress; it is her mobile face, her gestures and responses, that continually refine and sharpen and make honest the pleasant hokum with which the film surrounds her.",1970-03-17T05:00:00+0000

But the writer-director, Pierre Grimblat, a prize - winning filmmaker for television, is definitely a man to watchwith, one hopes, more to say next time.For about two-thirds of this Royal Films International release, which opened yesterday at the Cin Malibu, Grimblat's slightly jaded protagonist, Serge Gainsbourg, becomes more deeply involved with his youthful paramour, Jane Birkin, while blandly looking in occasionally on a wise, tolerant and loving wife, beautifully underplayed by Andrea Parisy. And since Gainsbourg is portraying a prize-winning televsion filmmaker, the director knowingly flicks the incidents forward in selective bits and pieces, and a rhythmical punctuation of sharp color images. The trouble is simply that Gainsbourg is neither especially interesting nor likable, being a petulant egocentric and also lucky to have a shapely, exuberant morsel like Miss Birkin (one of the teen-agers in ""Blow-Up"") for a plaything. The girl has somehow convinced herself that she loves him. But 40 or no 40, it is hard to fathom why he finally leaves his wife.Venice saves the picture, pulling it up taut and proving ever so subtly that the cynical hero has not lost his imagination. In this home-stretch chapter, a short story in itself, the camera strikingly trails the two lovers on the fringes of a film festival and cuts loose with a marvelous, mile-a-minute motor-launch ride through the canals that splatters and shakes the picture with a pictorial reality that transcends all that has gone before. It appears that Gainsbourg is finally going to act his age gracefully, noting the attraction of his restless mistress and a handsome Italian boatman. He does not, and the sour-grapes climax reveals him for what he really is, a flabby illusionist who deserves to stew in his own juice.",1970-03-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Boys in the Band':Crowley Study of Male Homosexuality Opens,"WATCHING the film version of Mart Crowley's ""The Boys in the Band,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's State I and Tower East theaters, I experienced the same sensation I'd had when I saw the Off Broadway play two years ago. It was a feeling of time disorientation, as if, in 1970, I were looking at a well-made Broadway play from the late thirties or early forties, something on the order of Clare Boothe's ""The Women"" or Joseph Fields's ""The Doughgirls.""This is in spite of the fact that ""The Boys in the Band"" is about male homosexuality, a subject that had to be treated with carefully metered ellipses in ""The Green Bay Tree,"" and in spite of the fact that the film uses four-letter words that once (honest!) were more shocking than glimpses of stocking.The reasons for this are two. One is obvious: ""The Boys in the Band"" is a well-made play, a little too well-made, too mechanical to be especially interesting. Not as obvious, perhaps, is the fact that many conventions of contemporary stage direction (so evident in both the play and the film), as well as the mannerisms of a certain kind of fake-elegant, American homosexual, are patterned after fashions set 30 or 40 years ago on the Broadway stage.Thus one can understand why William Friedkin, the director, has transferred the play's consciously archaic theatricality so faithfully to the screenwith the original Off Broadway cast, and almost every line of bitchy, fake-elegant dialogue, intact. Friedkin, who directed the very pleasant ""The Night They Raided Minsky's"" and the extremely intelligent film adaptation of Pinter's ""The Birthday Party,"" was not hired to improve ""The Boys in the Band,"" but to preserve it.This he has done, with the addition of a pre-title montage that serves to introduce the major characters in their natural habitats (bookstore, antique shop, street).The movie then opens with the ringing of a telephone and thereafter remains fixed in the time and place of the playa Saturday night birthday party at Emory's duplex apartment, fitted out with, among other things, an autographed poster of Marlene Dietrich and an extraordinary variety of toilet articles.In addition to Emory, a former Ivy League sort who is beginning to look like an aging queen, the celebrants include what is apparently meant to be a cross-section of homosexual types. They run a short gamut from seemingly straight to swish (including a token Negro), their one common denominator being their homosexuality. In the film, as in the play, the most interesting characterthe only one who might have an identity beyond that as a homosexualis Harold, a bitter, former professional ice-skater, whose birthday it is and who cooly describes himself as ""a 32-year-old, ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy.""Except for an inevitable monotony that comes from the use of so many close-ups in a confined space, Friedkin's direction is clean and direct, and, under the circumstances, effective. All of the performances are good, and that of Leonard Frey, as Harold, is much better than good. He's excellent without disturbing the ensemble.My reservations about ""The Boys in the Band"" all have to do with the source material, which sounds too often as if it had been written by someone at the party. Crowley has a good, minor talent for comedy-of-insult, and for creating enough interest, by way of small character revelations, to maintain minimum suspense.There is something basically unpleasant, however, about a play that seems to have been created in an inspiration of love-hate and that finally does nothing more than exploit its (I assume) sincerely conceived stereotypes.Crowley's vision of the world would seem to have been attained from a vantage point about three millimeters above the heads of his characters. If I heard him correctly, between the lines, he's most funny when he thinks he's being serious. He's saying something to the effect that life can't be one, long, continuous matinee. It's cheap sentiment, borrowed, I suspect, from the Late Late Show.",1970-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Liberation of L.B. Jones':Wyler Directs a Vivid Post-Poitier Drama Bleak Picture Painted of Racial Situation,"LORD BYRON JONES is the richest black man in Somerset, Tenn. He drives an air-conditioned Cadillac and has a wife, Emma, who, at 22, is young enough to be his daughter. His undertaking establishment, which offers the popular priced, Ellipsed in Christ service, and his deferential attitude toward the white community, have provided L. B. Jones with something resembling the Good (black) Life.That is, it's a good life until Emma, who lolls around her all-white bedroom all day reading Movieland, takes up with a young redneck Somerset policeman. Lord Byron Jones's subsequent suit for divorce wins him irrevocable liberationand it marks the beginning of what looks very much like revolution.When William Wyler (""Roman Holiday."" ""The Collector,"" ""Funny Girl"") makes such a vivid, melodramatic rationale for the collapse of race relations that the movie comes close to celebrating it, You had better believe that something is happening in this land. Political polarization has, at last, become the kind of reality in which Hollywood can invest several million dollars as a source for popular entertainment.Wyler's ""The Liberation of L. B. Jones,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's State II and Pacific East theaters, is a post-Potier, post-""In the Heat of the Night"" sort of movie. Gone is the essentially cheerful, separate-but-equal, we'll-work-this-out-together camaraderie that has always looked a little too easy in Sidney Poitier movies, because Poitier, after all, is a huge movie star (and thus a man of reason). ""The Liberation of L. B. Jones"" seems some more valid but only becase it is more bleak.I'm sure that Wyler and his screenwriters, Stirling Silliphant (who adapted ""In the Heat of the Night"") and Jesse Ford Hill, were out to make a suspense movie that would also work as contemporary social commentary. In the interests of melodrama, they have simplified the characters from Hill's novel to such a degree that they seem more stereotyped than may have been absolutely necessarya problem that is aggravated by some of the casting.Lee J. Cobb is ponderously predictable in what should be the film's most complex character, the Southern white lawyer of compromised sensibility who, without letting himself be aware of it, is responsible for the manner of L. B. Jones's eventual liberation. The juvenile leads, Lee Majors and Barbara Hershey, who could be the prototypes of all young studio contract players, are the film's mouth-pieces for moderation and liberalism, and they are so bland that those causes are doomed from the movie's start.The film, however, is not without interesting performances. Anthony Zerbe, a young man who parts his long hair in the middle and looks as if he drank too much beer, is excellent as the dull-witted redneck; Roscoe Lee Browne is properly prissy as the unfortunate L. B. Jones, and Lola Falana, who acts like an all-black Jean Harlow, is an admirable, not entirely conventional slut. More or less supervising them all is the impacable presence of Yaphet Kotto, who plays a young black man whose final act of violence seems to sanctify all violence. Wyler concludes this latter scene, in which Kotto pushes a farmer into his own baler with a long, impassive closeup of Kotto as he watches the man being transformed into fodder. It may be one of the coldest moments ever put on film.Mostly, in fact, Wyler's direction is notable only for the coldness and for an impatience to get on with the story at the expense of any feeling of real involvment. With ""The Liberation of L. B. Jones,"" Wyler, who is 68 this year, seems to be trying to keep up with the times. (On a technical level, he now uses the zoom lens instead of his old deep-focus technique.) I must say I wasn't bored by it, just depressed.",1970-03-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Hustler's Story:'Meat/Rack' Opens at 55th St. Playhouse,"THE cause of bisexual pornography may very well not be advanced by ""Meat/Rack,"" which opened yesterday at the 55th Street Playhouse. Its picaresque plot, 80 per cent gratuitous, offers something to everybody but not enough for anybody.The hero, a taciturn San Francisco hustler mysteriously called ""J.C."" (probably symbolic, but obscure; I suggest ""Junior Chamber of Commerce Member"") sells himself to men but gives himself to girls. He is much bullied by the misty image of his mother, who pursues him with admonitions all through the movie by means of countless unfocused but highly vocal flashbacks. Perhaps ""Meat/Rack"" will appeal to most mothers. In his adventures, J.C. encounters a bored housewife, a fat aging queen who feels alienated, a pair of knife-wielding sinister young queens, a dirty old picture taker, many firm-limbed young men, and the girl who might have redeemed himJean (Donna Troy).J.C. and Jean have something going for them, a wonderful shared memory of American movie theaters (he for business; she for pleasure), but their love is fated not to be, and she gets herself killed, and he returns to the road. But certain emphases in the production and nuances in David Calder's performance lead me to believe that J.C. isn't so crazy about girls anyway.The male-female sexual sequences seem mechanical and without the similitude of climax. The male-male sexual sequences are better  and one is almost sensuous and serious enough to redeem the film for maybe two whole minutes from the pretentiousness of its method. Mostly in color, occasionally in monochrome, sometimes so grainy as to suggest pointillism, ""Meat/Rack"" seems generally to have been shot from needlessly emphatic camera angles through dense bright smog. It is dramatically trivial and technically ponderous  an unpleasant combination. During its two beating sequences (with fists and with leather belt) it immediately switches to subjective camera from the point of view of the victim which conjures up the specter of some future cinema of cruelty, at $7.50 a ticket, in 3-D, for masochists.Playing with ""Meat/Rack"" is ""The Charles Pierce Review,"" a short film of transvestite cabaret that does not always succeed but that has performers who are often funny, bitter and sad enough to satirize not only dreams and desires of women but also the substance and despair of their own disguises.",1970-03-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen::De Palma's 'Dionysus in 69',"RICHARD SCHECHNER'S ""Dionysus in 69"" played during 1968 and 1969 in a converted garage on Wooster Street. Brian De Palma made his movie version in the course of just two actual performances. It opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater.Although rough in a few technical details, it is a film of extraordinary grace and power. With exceptional imagination and intelligence, De Palma has managed both to preserve the complex immediacies of Schechner's dramatic event (based on ""The Bacchae"" of Euripides) and to work those immediacies into the passionate and formal properties of his own creation.Schechner approached ""The Bacchae"" not so much to re-interpret the play as to re-experience some of the impulses surrounding and informing itto which end Euripides's lines were sometimes useful, and sometimes not. Schechner's troupe, the Performance Group, would by turns chant, or dance, make love, plot murder, whisper to the audience, or among themselves hold group therapy sessions.With its nudity (partial in the actual production I saw; total in the film), its audience-participation orgies (timid and embarrassing in the production; sensual and enthusiastic in the film) and its range of theatrical invention, ""Dionysus in 69"" strives for a degree of sensuous presence that, paradoxically, I think it best achieves as filtered through the film.De Palma uses a split screen, and he uses it in a variety of ways. Both sides of the screen always record the same moment in the production. But sometimes they will show different parts of the arena (the Performing Garage was a kind of multi-level theater in the round, with cast and audience often sharing spaces). Sometimes they will develop different points of view toward a single action. Sometimes they will place an apparently random event in formal perspective, and at the same time isolate important detail.The sequences in which the chorus of Bacchantes in effect give birth to Pentheus (William Shephard) and Dionysus (William Finley, in a fine performance) is so treated, and it makes a kind of patterned energetic sense on film that it did not, for me, make in production.And yet the film is a record of the production, slightly cut (the group therapy, blessedly, is gone), and not an attempt to extend the boundaries of theater through ""cinema."" Partly for this reason it is exciting as a movie, approaching its material with great brilliance and ingenuity, but never trying to supersede the material.Between the two principal personalities involved (I'll except Euripides, who really deserves most of the creditbut in a different kind of review) a mutually enriching tension seems to exist. For if Richard Schechner's power looks the greater for being framed within Brian De Palma's cameras, so De Palma, a witty, elegant, understated young director (for example, ""Greetings"") seems to have found new ease and vigor and a taste for risks in meeting the challenge of this film.",1970-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Czech's 'Beautiful Age' Weaves a Spell,"THE first Czechoslovak feature to be written and directed by Jaroslav Papousek, until now only a screenwriter in his country's current film resurgence, is a haunting, provocative comedy of serene wisdom and honesty titled ""The Most Beautiful Age.""While in the tradition of ""Loves of a Blonde"" and ""The Fireman's Ball,"" with an unhurried camera as a candid observer of human foibles, amusing and sad, it stands apart in curious and original dignity. The film arrived yesterday at the Cinema Village as part of the Grove Press International Film Festival.Himself a former sculptor, Mr. Papousek is concerned with the parade of humanity, young and old, at a sculpture atelier in a museum. With little camera movement, the studio is used as a stage for the behavior and reactions of those trooping in and out. Several old men, old-age pensioners, methodically appear as recruits for modeling, a briskly impersonal business by some blandly cavalier Bohemian students. A pretty young blond model poses in the nude, her only escape from a jealous husband and a child at home.Ironically and humorously, in the interchange of dialogue and trivial incidents, Mr. Papousek creates scenes that memorably evoke the childlike resignation of old age and the wise vitality of youth in a setting dedicated to the artistic imitation of life. But the best and funniest sequence is the final chapter, involving three rough-hewn, middle-aged coal deliverers, their gaping tour of the studio and their sly, nocturnal return to peer at the bizarre doings upstairs.As with most Czechoslovak comedies, the acting is so natural it is hardly noticeable as such. And this one, for all its attributes, may require considerable indulgence from any viewer weaned on Hollywood who simply wanders into the theater off the street.The film moves like molasses, leaving the museum only for a cat-and-dog home fight between the pretty model, played by Hana Brejchova, the heroine of ""Loves of a Blonde,"" and her sulking spouse, and also for another such tiff between an older couple, Josef Sebanek and Milada Jezkova, those wonderfully droll parents of the same movie.Finally, art museum or no art museum, the peeling, drab plaster of the backgrounds and the flat-gray lighting of the whole picture, together with the comparatively unwashed look of most of the cast, make up the dreariest-looking eyeful imaginable. Devotes of Lana Turner and the Land of Oz, be warned.",1970-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: The Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King Jr.,"""KING,"" an account of the public career of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. compiled and edited from several kinds of documentary footage by Ely Landau, is scheduled to play tonight only at many theaters throughout the country, including more than 50 in the boroughs of New York City. A longer version of the film will eventually be available for purposes of study, but for most moviegoers the theatrical version, which runs for almost three hours, may well seem long enough.In fact it is too long, exactly to the extent that it includes a number of cameo guest appearances by such stars as Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster, James Earl Jones and others who mostly look at the camera and very sincerely recite verse. But the rest of ""King,"" except for a few relevant national-affairs stock shots (Vietnam; Lyndon Johnson's Civil Rights bill), sticks close to its subject, and for its pains achieves a density and shapeliness that is rare in any movielet alone a documentary committed to the sequence of actual events.Those events begin with the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, when Dr. King was 27 years old, and they end shortly after his murder in Memphis, in April, 1968. Between, come the confrontations in Birmingham, the 1963 March on Washington, the three Selma voter-registration marches, the housing protests in Chicago, and finally the Memphis sanitation men's strike, which led to Dr. King's death. Even from this short distance, it is good to be reminded of recent history, and what that history, as it generates pride or even mere dramatic urgency, owes to black men in America.Although it makes some attempt to distinguish Dr. King and his nonviolence from the black militants who came after him, and although the distinction is accurate, the film strongly suggests the continuity of Dr. King and his successors in a drive toward a viable group identity. Dr. King's strategies, seen here in rich and spacious detail, seem to have been designed less for winning civil rights as such than for the use of civil rights as a means to human dignity. In Dr. King's platform and pulpit manner (of which there is a good deal) that bid follows a traditional Christian rhetoric for which religious belief and self-dramatization go hand in hand. The manner seems flamboyant, and a little old-fashioned. But it was a real form of communication, and for a while it worked.When it begins not to work, after the fire hoses of Birmingham have been replaced by the lawn sprinklers of Chicago, it strains toward a sense of fulfillment (with many quotations from ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"") that really does seem hollow. The film catches this shift with great precision and insight, just as it faithfully records only only bitter victories (for example, the Birmingham jail) but also victorious-seeming defeats (for example, the descent of the celebrities for the end of the third Selma march: a Nichols and May comedy routine, Harry Belafonte singing about the girl in Kingston Town.)But the truth of ""King"" is ultimately a ceremonial truth, of symbolic gestures, crowds, surging response. I know nothing to compare it with except Leni Riefenstahl's magnificent ""Triumph of the Will""not, of course, in tone or content, but rather in its comprehension of history as drama. But ""Triumph of the Will"" was history staged for the camera, and ""King"" is history understood by the camera. ""King"" attempts no analysis. It raises reportage to the power of ritual, and for all its lapses it is a most solemnly beautiful film.",1970-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Harold Robbins's 'Adventurers' Whoops Across Three Screens,"ON the screen, ""The Adventurers"" turn out to be an even duller bunch of meat-balls than they were in Harold Robbins's best-selling novel.Running close to three hoursin tired circleshalf of them whoop up not one but two revolutions in a South American republic called Corteguay. The other half, the Beautiful People, slither around sophisticated Rome, depicted as a kind of cocktail, mating arena, with the story finally shifting to a like treadmill in Manhattan. The chief commuter to all three locales, at the head of a milling, grab-bag, international cast, is a lippy, soulful-eyed young Yugoslav actor named Bekim Fehmiu. As adapted by Michael Hastings and Lewis Gilbert, the latter also directing and producing, this 10-ton junk has been assembled and charted with pomp befitting a ""Ben-Hur."" What really hurts is that the garish, careening behavior of these parasites, with a couple of exceptions, is accorded stunningly beautiful color photography by Claude Renoir.This pictorial canvasthe countryside sweep, sun-baked roofs and marble-interiors of a tropical country (actually Columbia) and some shimmering scenes in Rome and Veniceis the real waste and pity of a picture that swarms with employed performers, many of them popping in out for no discernable reason. And say this for Robbins's wooly yarn: you never know who or what lurks around the bendor the elbow of the peripatetic hero.In a nutshell, this is the story of a young Latin American, steeled by a revolution that destroys his family, who silkenly becomes the Playboy of the Western World, marries the world's richest heiress (Candice Bergen) and also two runners-up (not even shown), then abruptly bolts back home, in memory of his murdered father, help spearhead a revolution longer, bloodier and certainly louder than the first.The question is not so much why as how. Mr. Fehmiu, referred to by the others as a man among men, merely looks at women meltingly and they succumb (in a few unstartling peeks at bare anatomy), which is how he hooks Miss Bergen, who performs as though clubbed over the head. The dialogue may simply have stunned her.Excluding, very briefly, Olivia De Havilland, who maintains a fixed, intelligent expression as another prey, and Fernando Rey, who does well as the hero's father, most of the cast look slightly sheepish, among them Charles Aznavour, Alan Badel, Thommy Berggren, Ernest Borgnine, Rossano Brazzi and Leigh Taylor-Young, the latter as true-love-over-the-years. There is even an intermission, and perhaps should be after the hero is told: ""So here you are, a rich man with a wife he doesn't love and who can't give him children. What happens now?""The revolution  after a long, dull wait. And Director Gilbert has pulled off a spectacular blast-furnace lulu of human waste that may or may not be what Robbins and the picture were getting at.""A small cawntry,"" Fehmiu observes at one point, looking down from a plane, ""but so much blawd."" A little movie, in a king-size package, and so much baloney.",1970-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Variation on Eternal Triangle,"""MONIQUE,"" playing at the Lincoln Art, Avco Embassy East and Rialto Theaters, offers a version of the eternal triangle in which husband and wife both love the same girl.This is better than the other possible version of the eternal trianglein which husband and wife both love the same boybecause (a) the odds are nicer, and (b) potentially there is more action. As great literature reminds us (for example, ""Fanny Hill""), frigid females are often moved to men after being aroused by women; but who ever heard of a man preferring girls once he has found the boy of his dreams?Monique is an elderly French ""au pair"" girl who comes to live with an unhappily married young English couple, to cook, to care for their children and generally to spruce up their lives.From the first she proves a real find, with the kids and in the kitchen, but only after she completely satisfies the frustrated husband and then, on a Christmas Eve, brings the icy wife to a slow omnisexual simmer that lasts through the rest of the movie, does she fully demonstrate the meaning of ""service."" Such satisfactions and transformations are always pleasant to contemplate, and though never very exciting, ""Monique"" is heroically pleasant.Basically domestic comedy with a little nudity (very little) and a little sex (generally indicated by a woman rolling her head from side to side on the pillow and gasping a bit at the end), ""Monique"" explores such problems as how to wash, dry and play with youngsters, what to serve for dinner and how to trim the Christmas tree. I tried very hard to find all this suggestive, but I couldn't. And Monique herself, a kind of skin-flick Mary Poppins who smiles all the time and speaks good thoughts, doesn't help.Neither Sibylla Kay as Monique nor Joan Alcorn as the wife is likely to disturb your sleep, but Miss Alcorn has sensible British good looks, and just from the facial expressions she manages not to make, I think she might be fun to watch in a real movie.This movie, on the other hand, though never embarrassingly inept, is simply not sufficiently interesting. Much of its most libidinous action takes place behind tactfully closed doors (one brief scene, I swear, looks like lower-middle-class imitation Lubitsch), and all the rest, safely within the limits of the most timid assays upon the genre.",1970-03-28T05:00:00+0000
