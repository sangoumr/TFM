The reason given by the university was money, but Mrs. Neuman observed. The amount of money needed to keep it going is not significant in terms of their overall budget. If there had been interest in keeping the press going they could have done it. Longterm projects Northwestern was engaged in Included the definitive complete edition of Herman Melville's works, of which six volumes have been published, and a series in phenomenology and existential philosophy, which included Mr. Natanson's book. The resigned hope is that other presses will take over these projects, as well as Northwestern's other books. Mrs. Neuman summed up: This was really a tragic and unnecessary move, detrimental to the future of the university presses.",1974-05-05T05:00:00+0000

It's also by far the worst, but since the A.F.T. offerings included one fine film, ""The Homecoming,"" one recording of a fine production, ""Three Sisters,"" and a number of superlative performances, including that of Alan Bates in ""Butley,"" the A.F.T.'s initial season shouldn't be judged to have been as much of a failure as were some of its parts.""Lost in the Stars,"" based on Alan Paton's 1948 novel, ""Cry the Beloved Country"" (which was filmed in 1952), was first done on Broadway in 1949 and then revived in 1972. From the way that Daniel Mann has directed this film version, it seems to be a work completely dependent upon the conventions of the stage.In the theater we accept illiterate characters who sing Broadway-type lyrics and we pretend that the lyrics are poetry. We also accept startling narrative coincidences because, after all, the stage is so small that the most unlikely people might well bump into one anotherand often do when dancing.Mr. Mann has apparently had no idea how to create an equivalent reality in a film that appears to have been shot mostly on exterior locations meant to simulate those in South Africa, where the story is set. One result is a kind of aimlessness that pervades the film. The camera doesn't seem to know quite what to do when a character bursts into song over a real washtub in a real backyard. It seems almost embarrassed, as you might be if the person next to you in the subway suddenly launched into a full-throttle ""Some Enchanted Evening.""Thus the music and the lyrics that are supposed to be in the service of the drama are constantly upsetting it, making it look fabricated and false. This is too bad, since I suspect there is still a lot of power to be gotten from Mr. Paton's story of the old black country preacher, a man of orderly faith, and his search through the Johannesburg slums for the son who has become a murderer.For reasons best known to the film makers, they've pretty much dropped the original idea of the reconciliation between the black preacher and the wealthy old white bigot whose son was the victim of the murder. Even if that optimistic conclusion was dropped as smacking too much of 1949 liberalism, it still is dramatically more effective than the nothing ending that ""Lost in the Stars"" now has.The performers do much better as singers than as actors, and because Brock Peters, who plays the old preacher, has given good performances in the past, I assume his uneasiness here must stem from the aimlessness of the production as a whole.None of the actors come off well, and that includes Melba Moore as the poor ghetto girl, Clifton Davis as the black boy who goes wrong and Paul Rogers (so fine in ""The Homecoming"") as the bigoted white landowner.""Lost in the Stars"" is a very bad movie but it does contain the Weill score. The music almost compensates for the foolishness of the images, the lyrics, the drama and the point-of-view, which, in spite of the ending, recalls the ""ain't-black-folks-noble?"" philosophy evident in so much well-meaning theater of 40 to 50 years ago. Tote dat barge. Lift dat bale. A card at the beginning of the movie identifies the time of the story as ""The Recent Past."" That isn't enough to get the movie off the hook.",1974-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Once out of the hospital he lays about the house all day and broods. He wears the kind of white bandages and dark glasses that the Invisible Man used to wear so people wouldn't look through him. Okuyama is nasty to his wife, curses fate and is numbingly philosophical. ""A faceless man can feel free only in the dark,"" he may say. Or: ""The face is the door to the mind. Without it, the mind is shut off.""In view of all the talking Okuyama does, the latter statement doesn't make much sense, but that's the sort of movie Hiroshi Teshigahara's ""Face of Another"" is. It talks too much and too foolishly for its own good, like someone who can only be reassured by the sound of his own voice.The film was shown yesterday at the Regency Theater as part of its current festival of Japanese films. It will be seen again May 29-30 at Japan House as part of another festival of Japanese films sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Japan Society.""Face of Another,"" which was made in 1966, shares with an earlier, better Teshigahara film, ""Woman of the Dunes,"" a preoccupation with modes of identity. When Okuyama receives what is, in effect, a facial transplant, the new face takes over the old personality for eventually fatal results.

us,Strong Brazilian Drama of Misery,"Out of materials as timeless as mysticism, faith and the profound burdens of the human condition, the Brazilian director Ruy Guerra constructed a film as unsparing as its initial imagethe sun that parches the earth where his characters play out their wretched lives.The film, ""Os Fuzis"" (""The Guns"") was made 11 years ago and is being shown today and tomorrow at noon and midnight at the First Avenue-Screening Room.Set in drought-stricken northeastern Brazil, where misery and religion, intensified by the remorselessness of nature, border starvation and fantasy, the film employs a relatively small canvas to make broad statements. Embraced within the canvas are a single town, a handful of soldiers sent to guard from the passive, hungry populace a food shipment owned by one man; a nubile girl, a lone truck driver and a swelling legion of impoverished migrants in the train of a mystic with a sacred ox embodying the promise of the miracle of rain.Building slowly and at times in a manner difficult to comprehend until the cohesion of Mr. Guerra's design establishes itself, the director moves through his introductions and the surface of thingsglare, enervating heat, shaded and squinting eyes, dust and sweatinto his characters as individuals and then beyond them to comment on and question the nature of mankind.His vision of life is sharp, saddened, suffused with awareness of futility and failureof men, governments and faiths. It is no accident that the voice of the mystic resounds through this film with hoarse agony.",1974-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Today, unable to piece together a House of Commons majority for his Government's annual budget proposals, the Prime Minister reluctantly made the ritual request for the dissolution of Parliament and the call for what he somewhat testily referred to as an election that I am sure the people do net want. The dramatic change in his these resulted not from any repudiation by the Canadian people, but rather from a parliamentary imbalance that had become increasingly unworkable. The immediate that led to the Government's defeat in the House was the economy. The cost of living in March was 10.4 per cent higher than its level of a year earlier and the opposition parties maintained that Mr. Trudeau was not doing enough about it. But ever since the 1972 election, in which he lost ground, calls for a vote ch. no confidence had been a regular feature of the Parliament in Ottawa, with hooting and jeering and bitter heckling interrupting many of the debates.

It was late in the evening when I got to Atlanta and I had a severalhour wait for my connection to Birmingham.

Davis, a proponent, to convert two inches into metric, quicklike. The Democrat from Georgia replied, about 50 millimeters, thought about it a moment, and then said he was wrong. He was right. Representative John B. Anderson, Republican of Illinois, said that failure to pass the measure would place the United States with Trinidad, South Yemen and Tobago as countries that have not converted to the metric system.

So we are happy to lift the veil of traditional anonymity and announce that four spokespersons have recently broken out on their own. The first is Isabelle Holland, formerly of Lippincott, who has a new novel coming out called Kilgaren, to be published by McKay. Not only that but she has another slated for the fall called Trelawney. Then there is Lynn Caine, who is still publicity woman with Little, Brown, and who has written, Widow, an account of her own life after her husband's death. Ironically, Mrs. Caine's book came about because of one of those TV shows she's always hustling to get her authors on. She appeared on a Barbara Walters Not for Women Only show and received offers from four publishers to write a book. One of the watchers was Sherry Arden, publicity woman at Mdrrow, who wooed Mrs. Caine at lunch, along with Joni Evans, an editor there; the book went to Morrow. Mrs. Caine says she feels schizophrenic these days, promoting other authors books aswell as her own (when an author asks her about her book she firmly says, No let's talk about your book). Yes she's going on a coasttocoast publicity tour and her bosses have given her time off. Still another former publicity woman turned writer is Marcia Seligson, whose The Eternal Bliss Machine will be out in paperback this June. Lastly, there is Carol Hill of Random House, whose novel Let's Fall in Love was reviewed here April 14.

us,The Riches Of Jean Renoir:The Riches of Renoir,"ON Sept. 15 Jean Renoir will be 80 years old. It is thus unlikely that this giant among directors will work on any more films. This makes all the more special the appearance here this week (at the First Avenue Screening Room) of his most recent production, the limpid, lovely, rollicking, four-part movie titled ""Le Petit Thtre de Jean Renoir,"" commissioned five years ago for French television but just now having its commercial debut in Manhattan.From the opening sequence in which Renoir, in his first appearance on screen as himself, greets us, the audience, as he stands beside his miniature theater where the stories will unfold, and from the very first scene in the first story (""The Last Christmas Dinner""), in which two cranky Santa Clauses fight for territory outside a posh restaurant, until the bow of the actors that concludes the program, ""Le Petit Thtre de Jean Renoir"" unfolds with the kind of breathtaking effect that I associate with Hitchcock's ""Frenzy"" and with Buuel's ""Tristana"" and ""The Discreet Charm of The Bourgeoisie.""These films have nothing in common except that they are the works of superlative artists working in modes that they have been mastering for more than five decades. I'm perfectly aware that age doesn't automatically enrich a talent. It has a way of eroding all but the most profound talents, especially those of filmmakers who always are under particular stress to be responsive to the mass audience that, ultimately, allows the filmmaker to continue working. It's a terrible business, really. Compromises must be effected. So many that finally it becomes a triumph of sorts just to secure the necessary financing, to get a movie into production and, eventually, into a theater. After all that wear and tear, who can have the discipline of purpose to remember the film itself?Fine old moviemakers are very rare, largely, I suspect, because we  you and I  have a way of looking at each new film much in the manner that we peruse the front page of a daily newspaper. If it doesn't report some ghastly disaster, some startling development in science, some scandal, we're inclined to throw it aside. We've seen it before.Impatient critics and movie-goers in 1967 dismissed Charlie Chaplin's charming, 1930-esque comedy, ""A Countess from Hong Kong,"" with Marlon Brando and Sophire Loren playing extensions of Chaplin, because it didn't measure up to what they wanted that year (which included ""Elvira Madigan"" and ""In Cold Blood,"" to name just two of 1967's major hits).If the filmmaker lasts into old age, the results can sometimes be as remarkable as ""Bonaparte and The Revolution,"" Abel Gance's extraordinary reworking of his 1927 silent epic, ""Abel Gance's Napoleon,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival several years ago. At the age of 82 Gance re-edited ""Napoleon,"" added sound to those sequences that were still without it, and shot additional, material, to make a new epic film as well as an epic commentary on the evolution of films. (I understand that both ""Abel Gance's Napoleon"" and ""Bonaparte and The Revolution"" may soon be available for commercial distribution in this country, which is, to put it calmly, about time.)The pressure on theatrical film directors is the sort that can reduce strong men to jellies composed of flabby flesh, fear and avarice. Roberto Rossellini, who will be 68 this year, has survived and grown only by turning his back on theatrical films entirely, working instead on a series of educational films, financed by TV interests, that allow him to be as idiosyncratic as he wants. Had Rossellini eared that much for the high life, he'd probably be directing Mafia movies today for Dino De Laurentiis, or for some lesser equivalent.All of which makes the longevity and the richness of the careers of Hitchcock, Buuel and Renoir so rare. Attention must be paid, particularly at this moment to Jean Renoir.By some poetic chance, ""Le Petit Thtre"" is both a cause for celebration and an act of it. It is nothing so grand as a retrospective of the entire career of the man who made, among other masterpieces, ""Rules of The Game,"" ""Grand Illusion,"" ""Picnic on The Grass,"" ""The Southerner,"" ""The Diary of A Chambermaid,"" ""The River,"" ""The Golden Coach"" and ""French Can-Can.""It is a small film composed of three separate comedies plus a between-acts song sung by Jeanne Moreau, playing a solemnly untalented Parisian music hall performer, circa 1900. Yet the whole thing is so effortlessly composed, so wise and so full of the concerns that make each Renoir film memorable, it vividly evokes the spirit of the remarkable man we can still honor in his lifetime.The form of the film, a familiar sort of television device, has a special aptness for Renoir's career. Renoir, the host, introduces each story with a few words, at which point the camera moves from the director and crosses the tiny footlights of his miniature stage, where the stories are played. Life changes to theater which changes to life which changes to theater, until, at last, the people in Renoir's last little comedy have to walk to the apron of the stage and bow to us to return us to our own world.This Renoir fondness for theater is, I propose, less the philosophical expression that some critics would have you believe than it is a kind of polite recognition of life's most awesome, most banal riddles. What is real? Is everything a hopeless mess directed by someone with absolutely no interest in us? Renoir, I'm sure, doesn't know, nor if he thought he did, would he presume to say.None of the three little comedies is quite as simple as it might seem. ""The Last Christmas Dinner,"" about two Parisian clochards, an old man and an old lady whose make-up as derelicts is as artificial as the sets they inhabit, is the sort of fairy tale in which a character can say that ""Christmas is our most successful clich"" and then the sketch goes on to prove it.""The Electric Waxer"" is a modern ""opera"" about a furiously foolish housewife who loves her parquet floors more than she loves her husband or, as she says: ""Trust my floors to a maid? I'd rather die!"" Which, eventually, she does. The marvel is that Renoir manages to cover much of the same ground about the ""new Paris"" covered by Godard in ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"" without once slipping into the attitude of the shocked polemicist.He's hugely amused without being cruel or bitter, or, for that matter, unconcerned.The final sketch is Renoir returning to Marcel Pagnol country, the sun-filled, verdant Midi where a wealthy old landowner must come to terms (which he does) with the wife he loves and her young lover, who's his best friend. Renoir's love of nature is bursting out all over this sequence, but it has less to do with foliage than with people, with the troubled but flexible old man (Fernand Sardou), his beautiful, all-too-desirable bride (Franoise Arnoul), the conscience-stricken lover (Jean Carmet), and the nice, clumsy young maid (Dominique Labourier), who doesn't care who knows that she eavesdrops and who dreams of being a courtesan on the order of Messalina. She is, of course, the least likely Messalina anyone might imagine, but Renoir, and the rest of us with him, have a special fondness for the enormity of the dream.That, I think, is one of the enduring qualities that illuminate Renoir's little theater, his world. Nothing in it is ever inconsequential.",1974-05-12T05:00:00+0000

The series is under the aegis of ABC News and is produced and directed by Howard Enders. Its purpose is to describe the contributions of ethnic and racial minorities to American culture. The treatments vary in length, up to 18 minutes, depending on how far the preceding program falls short of the next hourly mark. The arrangement has obvious advantages. Wirees the network from having to stuff films and plays into time slots that end precisely on the hour or halfhour. At the same time, the network wins, Brownie points for public affairs.

And ""Pale Flower,"" a 1964 film being shown here for the first time, shares with some of Mr. Shinoda's other works some vexing characters, some unintentional vagueness and a set of subtitles that probably could have been more illuminating.""Pale Flower"" is an existential work, chiefly occupied with the rather remote relationship between a gangster (Ryo Ikebe) released from prison after serving time for murder and a mysterious young woman (Mariko Kaga), who lives for such kicks as high-stakes gambling, fast driving, drugs and witnessing the murder that sends the gangster back to jail again.""Pale Flower"" is a film that has been likened to Jean-Luc Godard's memorable ""Breathless.""

us,Screen: 'Going Places':Blier Directs Tale of Two Errant Youths The Cast,"""Going Places,"" the new French film by Bertrand Blier, the 35-year-old son of the actor Bernard Blier, is about two muscular young men on the road, going no place though they never stop moving. Jean-Claude (Gerard Depardieu) is the more aggressive of the two. Pierrot (Patrick Dewaere) seems the more resourceful, though he apparently enjoys being told what to do by his buddy. They share everything  stolen loot, hypochondria, boredom, women and, when there are no women, each other.At the beginning of the film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema 2, Jean-Claude and Pierrot rough up a middle-aged woman of faint heart and large pocketbook. They scare hell out of her but don't get around to rape. They later steal a car and kidnap a dim-witted blonde who doesn't mind being kidnapped at all, though she doesn't like getting shot at and beaten up, which the boys do, not so much out of viciousness as out of impatience.By the end of the film, after some funny, horrendous adventures that take them aimlessly from one end of France to the other, Jean-Claude and Pierrot have clearly become the victims. They are the pursued, doomed like that mythical bird Tennessee Williams sometimes writes about, the one that must spend its entire life flying, since evolution has denied it landing gear.""Going Places"" is handsome, mock-tough and thoroughly empty-headed, like Jean-Claude and Pierrot. It's a movie whose good performances and technical expertise can never disguise the vacuity of its assumed nihilism, which bears about as much relation to the real thing as fashion photography does to the work of Cartier-Bresson.Mr. Depardieu and Mr. Dewaere have a high old time in characterizations that seem composed less of attitudes taken from life than from old movies, early Belmondo, James Dean and any number of early Godard characters. Miou-Miou is also extremely attractive as the blonde who tags along with them, because there really isn't anything better to do. She later gives the pair her overwhelming gratitude when by chance, they set up the circumstances that result in her achieving her first orgasm. Such is the nature of much of the film's sense of humor.Jeanne Moreau, looking tired, wise and very beautiful, comes on screen in the middle of the movie as a woman who's just completed a 10-year stretch behind bars. She gives it, briefly, the weight and direction the film otherwise lacks, much in the manner that Jack Nicholson's appearance showed up the superficial attitudes of the rest of ""Easy Rider."" You may want to be forewarned, however, that the sequence concludes with what appears to be a suicide in a manner that more or less sums up the film's feelings about women. The suicide makes no sense on any level I can think of.The French are a funny race. The film's ads quote one Parisian critic who found ""Going Places"" to be ""a hymn to life"" of the sort that makes one glad to be alive. I must say that though I thought parts of it funny, and Miss Moreau riveting, the net effect was one of irritation and gloom. It's not very invigorating to see so much talent squandered on such foolish mixed-up romanticism.",1974-05-14T05:00:00+0000

He is Dr. Donald Coggan, 64 years old, an active evangelist, a critic of permissiveness and, at present, Archbishop of York. [1:35.1NationalWhether President Nixon played any role in originating the Watergate coverup attempt was the principal question the House Judiciary Committee considered in its second closed impeachment hearing. The committee moved toward subpoenaing 11 more White House tape recordings when its lawyers decided it would not be possible to clarify the President's early attitude toward the Watergate breakin without them. [1:5.1General revulsion was expressed by Republican party leaders in a dozen stateseast and west, north and southwho were interviewed about their reactions to President Nixon's edited Watergate transcripts. They agreed that the President had been harmed by the transcripts release, and like most Republicans in Congress they appeared to want the House impeachment investigato continue. [1:23.1 James D. St. Clair, Mr. Nixon's chief defense attorney, has been rebuked by Raoul Berger, a constitutional scholar, for basing the impeachment defense on what Mr. Berger calls instant history, farfetched theories and sheer effrontery.

Public disclosure of the gifts to Mrs. Nixon, which included an emerald and diamond necklace with matchihg pieces valued at $52,400, was made by The Washing: ton Post. [1:23.1 Congress and the Nixon Administration appeared to be heading for another battle: this time over the refusal of the Internal Revenue Service to provide certain information about I.R.S. investigations of militant and revolutionary organizations wanted by the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, headed by Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr. The I.R.S. has decided so far to provide only one of the items requested, a list of the names of the 8,000 politically active individuals and 3,000 activist organizations on which the I.R.S. has gathered information.

us,Screen: Butchery Binge:Morrissey's 'Warhol's Frankenstein' Opens,"Nowadays, flashing your hash can be a tribute to the film makerjust as belching was said to compliment the hosts of ancient China. While one suspects that the tales about upchuck at ""The Exorcist"" were eagerly exaggerated, ""Andy Warhol's Frankenstein,"" written and directed by Paul Morrisey, almost begs the gorge to rise. Hence those with iron guts may rank as Philistines  unable to respond to the call of art. The movie opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and West.A fascistic baron (Udo Kier), who plans to create and control a new master race, assembles beautiful rigid zombies out of freshly killed spare parts. As his hands caress kidneys, spleens and gall bladders, his unfinished creatures appear like mutilated corpses, and disembowelment becomes a substitute for sex. (Some of the innards resemble lobster salad, an evocation that stresses the obvious expense of this production.) Throughout, the accents of the wicked are as thick as minestrone""Let's get rrrid of ziss useless trrrunk""  and the blood splashes as noisily as an open fire hydrant.3-D effects (summoning wistful memories of ""House of Wax"") are used to project the butchery: Dripping giblets on forceps are thrust into the audience, while the performers  including Joe Dallesandro as a sulky stud and Monique Van Vooren as the baron's huffy wife and sister  practically leap into your lap. Since much of the action is slow, these diversions are welcome, although hanging onto the 3-D glasses can be rough if you're a nearsighted, note-taking smoker.In a muddy way, the movie attempts to instruct us about the universal insensitivity, living-deadness and the inabilty to be turned on by anythng short of the grotesque. However, this ""Frankenstein"" drags as much as it camps; ""despite a few amusing moments, it fails as a spoof, and the result is only a coy binge in degradation.",1974-05-16T05:00:00+0000

This was billed as a New York premiere, although more accurately it seems to have been the premiere of Brecht's slightly revised version. The cantata was originally called Lindbergh's Flight, but in 1950 Brecht, for obvious political reasons, decided to delete all references to the Lindbergh name and to transform the piece into something more universal.",1974-05-19T05:00:00+0000

To the inhabitants it seems impervious, impersonal and inorganic. The primary reasons for hard architecture, Sommer theorizes, are a garrison state mentality on the part of the builders or owners, and their desire to create or maintain facilities the users cannot deface or destroy. Sommer has divided hard architecture into seven major representative groupsmental institutions, prisons, airports, zoos, schools, offices, universities.. In all of them he finds common characteristics: Expensive to construct, alter, or raze. Clear differentiation of status levels.... Passive adjustment and psychological withdrawal are encouraged.

us,Book. Ends,"Hard Sell. Everybody knows that publicity sometimes helps sell a book and everybody also knows that it is a bit more difficult to hook up a novelist on the talkshow circuit. So we will call an expert witness to the stand on the subject of publicizing a novel, Sol Stein, the Stein of Stein & Day, publishers (his wife, Patricia, is the Day). He the only publisher, as far as we know, who is also a successful novelist; his last book, The Magician, sold over 500,000 copies in all editions. Since Mr. Stein has a new book out, published by Arbor House (sea page 38) and is reputed to be a man who knows how to push a hook, we were not.surprised to learn that he had just returned from a tour of a dozen or so cities. Another writer we know whose path crossed Mr. Stein's on the circuit noticed with awe his custom of appearing with a 3 by 5 card in hand. Mr. Stein explained that the card contains reminders to himself of things to talk about. The notes, printed in a large typeface known as Orator, Prod Mr. Stein to set the scene of the book, discuss all the characters, rather than just the main one; there are also such cryptic mnemonics as coupling without a contract (to remind Mr. Stein to say that he is no longer in favor of living together with benefit of clergy) and after women's lib what? which brings him around to the theme of his book. As for the importance of publicity, he learned from his last book that sales were highest in (a) the four cities which he had visited personally and (b) the cities in which the David Frost Show on which he had appeared was shown in prime time. His advice to novelists who want to go the talkshow route: Have a nonfiction theme to talk about (his is postwomen's lib so War and Peace is, as Woody Allen said, a book about Russia). Also, being a publisher helps, since there are a lot of wouldbe writers out there who want to know how to write a successful novel, Mr. Stein imparts three rules. What else did he learn? The distribution of books in this country is abysmal. There followed a typical author's story about none of his books being on display when he showed up for a bookstore appearance. Authors, even when they're publishers, are all alike.",1974-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Fair Day deals with the pursuit of one John Waters, about 22 years old, by the 16yearold girl he has made pregnant. Ellen, like the irretrievably pathetic masochist of the old ballad, risks everything for the exquisitely diabolical Waters. Somehow her obsession (love?) for John's male beauty sustains her through her tribulations, for it is only at the end, following the birth of their son, that John Waters will acknowledge his relationship to the baby.",1974-05-19T05:00:00+0000

His preference of T. Sturge Moore to Yeats is well known, together with many others like it. Fullscale attacks were launched on him in midcareer by F. 0. Matthiessen, Randall Jarrell and Theodore Spencer, and long ago a popular survey of literary criticism dubbed him a bad critic of some importance. Apparently it is hard not to listen to Winters but no trouble at all to dismiss him. Dramatic justice seems to be at work here: a critic whose own intolerance is so thoroughgoing will not, even among the shades, find the fruits of ordinary human charity.",1974-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen:Liv Ullmann, Hackman in 'Zandy's Bride'","What promises to be an engrossing character study of a lovely, lonely mail-order wife and her adaptation to a crude, pioneer huband tapers off episodically and disappointingly in ""Zandy's Bride.""It does so despite an intelligent performance by Liv Ullmann, whose luminous eyes light up the screen every minute, and the steady, watchful direction of Jan Troell, who has impressively rooted his first California film in a wild sweep of the Big Sur area. But for simple, sustained impact and depth, the new picture can't touch Mr. Troell's two superb pioneer dramas, ""The Emigrants"" and ""The New Land,"" filmed in his and Miss Ullmann's native Scandinavia.The Warner Bros. release that opened yesterday at the Sutton has two snags in character and drama. The first is the rolenot the performanceof Gene Hackman, that of a selfish, thick-skulled hero, who savagely assaults his new bride and actually expects her to accept and love him. And indeed she does, though our acceptance is something else. An actress less skillful than Miss Ullmann might have run him through, for his persistent brutality, with a pitchfork, script or no script.Furthermore, the emotional tug-of-war is scuttled toward the end of the picture by isolating Mr. Hackman with some cattle thieves and then scooting him farther away to San Francisco for some brief soul-searching. This is the fault of Marc Norman's screenplay, adapted from Lillian Bos Ross's novel, ""The Stranger."" By shedding the wife's viewpoint, it breaks the real narrative. The story-line and Mr. Hackman have nothing to do but ramble back home, where, of course, the mountain grass is greener.Of the supporting cast, Eileen Heckart wisely underplays a burdened pioneer mother. Maria Cordova is especially good as a warmhearted but wanton woman. Eventually, though, the restless viewer begins peering more and more beyond the people to the awesome reality of Big Sur, where at least Miss Ullmann, her director and his photographer, Jordan Cronenweth, find and hold firm footing.",1974-05-20T05:00:00+0000

After they see some radically new styles in the stores for a while, or on their friends, they begin to consider wearing them themselves. Or at least trying them on.These are the women who were reluctant to accept pants, until recently, and who are certainly not going to accept calf length skirts next fall. But they are open to suggestions in such areas as color and texture, they will accept some loosening up in the fit of clothes and they are ready for more casual styles.Kimberly, which has long been a security blanket for these women, touches all three bases. It offers plum tones and mauvepink in the color category. It deepens some armholes and blouses some tops. And best of all, it puts everything together so a women doesn't have to shop around for a shirt after she finds a suit.The pants suit, which Kimberly has turned into a way of life for many fans, now comes equipped with sleeveless sweaters and shirts. Patterns such as wallpaper designs, geometric shapes or bold stripes liven things up. At night, there are glitterknit sweaters with black pants with tunic tops.Everything's knitted and the price range is $75 to $240.Take a fake leather jacket, tweed pants and a print blouse. Or a flareback jacket in melton cloth over a pleatedfront dress. Sportswear? No. Casual clothes by Shannon Rodgers for Jerry Silverman. This is only part of the story at this traditional dress house. It offers flowered velvet pants and jackets tor lounging around the house, plenty of chiffon and sequins for going out at night and little suits to wear to dinner.Mr. Silverman is particularly enthusiast:lc about a casual dress with a fly front closing that has sold spectacularly well in cotton for spring and is being done in gabardine for fall. He's calling it his million dollar dress because stores have ordered 10,000 styles to sell at $110.The other prices are mostly in the $25 to $200 range.Now, nobody wants to be sensible all of the time. Fernando Sanchez figures that even conservative types will let themselves go in the privacy of their own home. So he's invented some seductive little styles to wear lounging, sleeping or even under clothes for those women who still fancy underwear.Some are rather versatile, such as the lacetopped camisole that can be teamed with boxer shorts under dresses or with long pants at dinner.",1974-05-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Invasion by Bats in 'Chosen Survivors',"Movie science-fiction, which has threatened mankind with all kinds of berserk fauna from ants to dinosaurs, now is transmitting future shock with bats in ""Chosen Survivors,"" which landed at Loews State and other theaters yesterday. If the chills are intermittent, the combination of the voracious vampires and fumbling scientists as unwitting partners in disaster gives some novelty and a sardonic twist to this latest manufactured view of a possible doomsday.The 11 survivors here have been selected by computer to live in a seemingly safe, luxurious, gadget-filled environment miles below the earth's surface, presumably to save mankind after a wholly destructive thermonuclear war.Naturally, this American lite includes young, handsome male and female scientists, a tycoon, a writer, a Congresswoman and a black Olympic gold medal winner, who cautiously accept their fate until those screeching bats invade their haven. And the behaviorial expert among them soon drives them up the stainless steel walls by confessing that there is no nuclear holocaust and that they're actually guinea pigs in a controlled experiment.Who survives is not important here. Sutton Roley, a television director, maintains a fair level of suspense aided largely by scientific gimmickry, technical effects and action sequences that accentuate the inmates' terror. The script by H. B. Cross and Joe Reb Moffly, newcomers to this observer, offers them some dialogue that realistically reflects on man's inhumanity to man.Properly taut, if not memorable, performances are contributed by the principals, among them Jackie Cooper as the self-centered tycoon; Lincoln Kilpatrick as the proud Olympian; Barbara Babcock as the pretty and proficient doctor; Bradford Dillman as the behavorial observer hoist by his own experiment, and Richard Jaeckel as the beleaguered electronics overseer.",1974-05-23T05:00:00+0000

Now, almost two years later, with the publication of his compelling autobiography, MyRace Be Won (Charterhouse, $10), his explanation spills out in a torrent, Vincent Matthews is black and that influenced him. But beyond that, he is an individual, and all track and field athletes are by the nature of their individual role in their individual events, He is an individual who is complex, sensitive, brooding and concerned with living with what he demands of himself rather than what others demand of him. Perhaps more important to the world, he has emerged as a sYmbo! of what the Olympics have become, a farce of politics among nations, instead of what the Olympics are supposed to be, the flame of competition among athletes.",1974-05-23T05:00:00+0000

us,' That's Entertaiment!' Certainly Is,"When Graham Greene was a movie critic in the nineteen-thirties, he detested close-ups of the open mouths of singers; his reviews complained steadily of teeth and tonsils. He would be miserable at ""That's Entertainment!,"" a tour of M-G-M musicals from 1929 to 1958but those who don't share his phobia will hugely enjoy this movie. Written, produced and directed by Jack Haley Jr., it opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld.The pleasures are abundant: Gene Kelly squelching sublimely through puddles in ""Singin' in the Rain""; Judy Garland singing ""Get Happy"" over a series of clips of her faces at all agesthe result is a joyful obituary; Donald O'Connor dancing on his knees; Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell in a breath-stopping duet from ""Broadway Melody of 1940."" Glimpses of Mr. Kelly, springing about on the scaffolding of a half-constructed building, and Mr. Astaire, dancing with a hat rack, distill the contrasting styles of both great hoofers.Mr. Kelly's acrobatic talents make you aware of the exertion as much as the dexterity: what he does is triumphantly difficult, and we know that almost no one else could leap so smartly from one spot to another. But, as many have noted, Mr. Astaire makes every step look easy: as he soars and swoops and glides, infinite spectators feel that they could do exactly the same.Some of the musicals of the early thirties were creaky because dramatic actors were suddenly pushed into a medium that didn't suit them. In ""Idiot's Delight,"" Clark Gable dances and sings abominably, and Joan Crawfordone rigid finger laid against her cheek  prances like a lumberjack. The movie's funniest moment may be the apotheosis of Esther Williams in the early fifties: climactic scenes of that brawny Venus sinking into or rising from the water appear to mock the imagery of the Aquarian age. Incidentally, the big ballet from ""American in Paris"" seems soupier than ever.Ars Gratia Artis indeed . . . Today, there's a pang in watching that lion roar above M-G-M's motto, to see the ravaged sets of the studio whose existence was imperiled for a while (although movie production has resumed). Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Mickey Rooney and the other stars who narrate this picture are sentimental about the pastbut why shouldn't they be? Meanwhile, most of the numbersfrom Jimmy Durante coaching the young Frank Sinatra in ""It Happened in Brooklyn"" to Leslie Caron drifting in and out of Mr. Kelly's grasp  run long enough so that you can re-experience the original. Hence this isn't nostalgia, it's history.",1974-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Book Ends,"June. The month of June will erupt with final burst of publishing energy before the summer doldrums set in. A clutch of potential best sellers are slated, as well as numerous biographies and a spattering of political books, related by varying degrees of consanguinity to the President's Watergate troubles. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's muchpreviewed The Gulag Archipelago (you may have heard of it) will at last make its debut. John Le Clare goes back out into the cold with anotber spy novel, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and the word is he hasn't lost his touch. Philip Roth returns to a realistic vein, after such ventures as The Breast and The Great American Novel, with My Life as a Man. Already a best seller in some areas a month before publication date is the Watergate uncoverup, All the President's Men, by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, a surprisingly suspenseful tale of hubris in high places (eat your heart out, Allen Drury, Fletcher Knebel, et al).... In a related development. as the newscasters say, Gerald Ford is the hem, on the whole, of a rush biography by Bud Vestal and a team of Michigan newsmen. Peter Schrag studies Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers case of a hundred or so years ago in 4'Test of Loyalty. Thomas Eagleton and George McGovern are chummily paired, as they were not in life, with books in the same month, while Mary McCarthy's coverage of the Ervin Committee hearings is collected in The Mask of State. The Ripon Society anatomizes gameplan mentality in the 1972 election in Jaws of Victory. Jeb Stuart Magruder confesses in An American Life. And on power itself there is Kenneth B. Clark's The Pathos of Power. . One paragraph of Watergateiana is enough, so let us turn to biography and note that we have heard good things about Margaret Drabble's Arnold Bennett. Yukio Mishima's prolonged post mortem continues with a biography, The Life and Death of Yukio Mishima, by Henry ScottStokes. Other biographical subjects Include Dwight Eisenhower, Mick Jagger, P. G. Wodehouse, Frank Costello, Blaze Starr, Marlon Brando, V. Sackville West, Marie Curie, Miles Davis, Yogi Berra, Lenny Bruce, George Raft, Joey Gallo, Babe Ruth and Giacomo Puccini... Piri Thomas (Down These Mean Streets) tells of prison life from the inside in Seven Long Times""; Nikita Khrushchev (Khrushchev Remembers) remembers some more; and Kate Millett (Sexual Politics) lives with her newfound fame in Flying....
