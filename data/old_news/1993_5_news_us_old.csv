The incident drew more attention to the Latin Kings, an organization of Hispanic and Italian men and women founded four years ago within the state's prison system. Over the last two years authorities have linked the band to scores of assaults and at least six homicides. As reports of the group's activities surfaced in the news media, Beatrice Codianni of New Haven, a longtime supporter of grass roots politics, took note.

us,In the Pleasure District,"The Japanese term ukiyo-e -- ""pictures of the floating world"" -- brings to mind the woodblock prints of the Edo period (1615-1868), yet many of the artists who designed these prints also created smaller numbers of refined ukiyo-e paintings. Foreigners living in or visiting Japan from the 1870's onward were the first to appreciate and collect these paintings; more than 200 of them now held by the British Museum are reproduced, in color, in UKIYO-E PAINTINGS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM (Smithsonian Institution, $39.95). Courtesans of the Yoshiwara pleasure district of Tokyo are the predominant subjects. In his introduction, Timothy Clark, a curator at the museum, describes the government-licensed brothel quarter, which opened in 1617, and something of the lives of the women indentured there. He notes that the idealized images of ukiyo-e -- meant to extol the amusements of the quarter and the charms of its highest-ranking prostitutes -- did not show ""the seamier side of the prostitution industry that is known all too well to have existed from diaries, popular literature and other written sources."" Indeed, plate after plate depicts elegant women lounging about waiting for their patrons, reading love letters or strolling to houses of assignation. The elaborate designs of their kimonos and sashes are far more expressive than their stylized facial features. Also in this collection are paintings of craftsmen at work, landscapes, a selection of forgeries and some erotica. Students of art history will appreciate Mr. Clark's detailed notes on the artists. And we can thank him as well for his candor in declaring that the primly titled ""Maids Seduced by Workmen"" is, in fact, a painting of a rape.",1993-05-02T05:00:00+0000

Visitors familiar with Eisenman's past enigmas -- staircases stuck to the ceiling or leading to a blank wall -- may find themselves bowled over by waves of gratitude. Fortunately, legibility isn't all this building has going for it. It brings a brash, poetic order to a chaotic urban landscape, shaping a middle ground between a city and the forces that threaten it.

To be sure, there were also spurts of creativity here and there, several lapses, some new stirrings and seemingly endless parades of perfectly nice clothes with a modicum of newness. But what Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Geoffrey Beene achieved this season were collections very much in their well-known styles, now rendered with such quality, high standards and polished execution that they are on a par with the work of such towering European talents as Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. Geoffrey Beene's designs are further extensions of his singular point of view, based on a knowledgeable, often complex cut. Calvin Klein's offerings are a perfectionist's rendition of the totally unadorned. Donna Karan creates the season's fluid silhouettes in a sensual, highly sophisticated manner.

While he occasionally dabbled in subjects outside his chosen field -- the Bible, say, or the works of William Shakespeare -- he took his self-imposed burden seriously.",1993-05-09T05:00:00+0000

He went down again in the fourth, just seconds before the referee, Vic Drakulich, stopped the fight 2 minutes 3 seconds into the round. ""My timing was right on the dot. I was using my combinations very well,"" De La Hoya said. ""I was hitting him very hard and a few seconds later, he just fell."" De La Hoya, 131 pounds, improved his record to 7-0 with six knockouts. Avelar, 131 1/2, of Las Vegas, dropped to 15-3. Avelar, who fought for El Salvador in the 1988 Olympics, said he was unable to put pressure on De La Hoya, who has fought monthly since turning pro in November.

Sixty-one extraordinary faces -- most belonging to well-known writers, artists and performers -- are on view in the elegant volume THE PASSIONATE OBSERVER: Photographs by Carl Van Vechten (Hallmark Cards/University of New Mexico, cloth, $40; paper, $25). Carl Van Vechten (1880-1964) was a connoisseur of avant-garde art, dance and music, an early and knowledgeable enthusiast of black American culture, and a writer whose work included music criticism for The New York Times early in the century, seven novels, and eight volumes of music and literary criticism. Gregarious and a bit of a dandy (he was known for gold and jade bracelets and outrageous neckties), Van Vechten counted among his friends Gertrude Stein, George Gershwin, Paul Robeson, W. Somerset Maugham, Langston Hughes, Eugene O'Neill and Mabel Dodge. He was an inveterate collector and cataloguer; at the age of 15 he began taking photographs with a box camera. Of the more than 15,000 photographs he made over the last 30 years of his life, most are portraits, many of friends or acquaintances. ""His artistic vision was founded on a belief in the primacy of the talented individual and a recognition of the varied backgrounds, temperaments and tastes from which such accomplishment could arise,"" Keith F. Davis, the fine-arts programs director at Hallmark Cards, writes in a graceful and informative essay. Van Vechten's photographs combine the informality and immediacy of the snapshot with a highly personal and studied documentation of his subjects. In portraits of subjects like Gershwin, Maugham, Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Bessie Smith, Willa Cather, Anna May Wong, Marlon Brando and Thomas Mann, Van Vechten created strange, evocative images that reveal aspects not only of the subject but also of the photographer and of his era.",1993-05-09T05:00:00+0000

Henke finished with a 72-hole total of 17-under-par on the hilly Atlanta Country Club course to post a two-shot victory over Price, Mark Calcavecchia and Tom Sieckmann. Price, who began the day with a one-shot lead over Calcavecchia, missed three consecutive greens beginning at No. 15, managing to salvage par only on the No. 17 when he made an 8-footer. After falling into a tie for third place, Price moved back to share second when he birdied the final hole. Calcavecchia, who has missed eight cuts so far this year, closed with a 72 and Sieckmann had a 69. Henke earned a first prize of $216,000.

Her 15-foot putt was wide left and gave her a two-under-par 70 for the day, a 54-hole total of 205 and a tie with Tombs. Mallon earned $78,750 for the victory. (AP)",1993-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Sampras is playing in his second tournament on clay this season and his first on the slower, red surface in Europe. He was generally satisfied with his game in the 1-hour-39-minute match, especially for having staved off a third set on a hot, sunny day at the Foro Italico. Sampras saved a set point when the 50th-ranked Furlan returned a deep service into the net, and the American later ended the match with an ace in the tie breaker. Fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who is also more accustomed to faster surfaces, defeated Jaime Oncins, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, and then called the victory his best match of his injury-plagued season. Jan Siemerink beat No. 12-seeded MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), to score the first upset in the $1.75 million tournament.

This was the first time the two played since their stirring opening-round match at the 1991 United States Open. At that time, Connors rebounded from a two-set, 0-3 deficit to win in five sets and make a theatrical march to the semifinals. But the 40-year-old Connors is now concentrating on business ventures and the start of his 35-and-older tour. He has played in only five tournaments this year, losing in the first round four times, and is ranked 172d in the world. Last night, he was betrayed by an erratic serve. In the 11th game of the first set, he served three of his six double faults, virtually handing the set to the McEnroe, who is ranked 88th.

Wisps of steam float upward from among the few bushes and low trees, lichens and wiry ferns: species that return first after a lava flow, most of them endemic to these islands that the lava has made in the middle of the ocean, farther away from other land than any place on earth. The steam phantoms bear an outlandish resemblance to the vapors that rise out of some of the streets in Manhattan.

us,Acts of Love and Wonder,"Dorothy Norman is best known for her role as Alfred Stieglitz's confidante, student and tireless promoter. Though married and more than 40 years younger than Stieglitz when she first encountered him in his Manhattan art gallery in 1927, she was drawn swiftly into his world, enthralled by his genius and powerful convictions as well as by the contemporary art he championed. Their relationship grew intimate and mutually sustaining, and lasted until his death in 1946. As pointed out in the essays by the photography critic and curator Miles Barth and the photography historian Edward Abrahams in INTIMATE VISIONS: The Photographs of Dorothy Norman (Chronicle Books, cloth, $27.50; paper, $17.95), Ms. Norman did not pursue a career as a photographer but approached photography as a private act of love and wonder. Her cityscapes, portraits, images of flowers and architecture are reproduced here in the rich tones favored by her mentor and in their original small scale. Not too surprisingly, Stieglitz is a vital presence in this elegantly designed book. He inspired her style and subjects; even his handwriting becomes part of the book's graphic design. The many portraits reveal the range of movers and shakers with whom Ms. Norman, who is now 88 years old, was acquainted -- Lewis Mumford, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Richard Wright and Elia Kazan, among others. Her pictures of Stieglitz, however, are more animated and more, in his words, wonderfully seen.",1993-05-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Candidates on the Issues,"On June 8, Republicans in New Jersey will select a challenger to Gov. Jim Florio in the November general election. Here is a look at the candidates by Jerry Gray of The Times's Trenton bureau. James H. Wallwork Former State Senator, 62, of Far Hills Says he would bring to government the lessons he learned as a conservative businessman.... Former owner and partner of Wallwork Brothers, Inc. of West Caldwell, N.J., a refrigeration, heating and air- conditioning wholesale distributor.... Member of the State Assembly from 1963 to 1965 and of the State Senate from 1967 to 1981.... This is his second run for the G.O.P. gubernatorial nomination. Strengths: Appeals to conservatives; has specific plans. Weaknesses: Name recognition low, late start, not enough money. Christine Todd Whitman 46, of Tewksbury. A moderate Republican who has campaigned as an outsider from Trenton politics who will shake up the old system.... This is her first race for a statewide office.... Served on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders and as president of the State Board of Public Utilities. In 1990 she almost upset Bill Bradley in a race for the United States Senate. Strength: Strong organization Weakness: Inexperience in government. Cary Edwards Former Attorney General, 48, of Oakland. A moderate Republican in the style of his former boss and political mentor, Governor Kean, Mr. Edwards has centered his campaign on the fight against crime and his experience in state government, which includes service as a State Representative and as Attorney General....Finished second in the 1989 gubernatorial primary; managed New Jersey office of the law firm of Mudge-Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon; Took a leave to run. Strengths: Experience, strong grasp of the issues. Weaknesses: Late start, vague message, low name recognition. ABORTION Each candidate supports a woman's right to choose. Wallwork: Opposes governmental financing. Whitman: No additional comment. Edwards: No additional comment. TAXES All dislike the $2.8 billion tax increase that Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature. They are divided over how to dismantle it. Wallwork: Favors repealing the entire package. Proposes to do so by cutting four percent ($550 million) from the state's annual budget in his first four years in office. Whitman: Has backed off early statements that indicated she would repeal all the taxes immediately. Now says cutting the taxes will be a ""goal"" of her administration, but has not been specific about how she would do this. Edwards: Wants the Republican-controlled Legislature to immediately reduce the income tax and to make other tax changes beginning with the 1994 budget proposals now under discussion. Says he would push for an elected state auditor to help him identify waste and overstaffing in state government and would use those cuts to offset repeal of the taxes. EDUCATION Reform and financing of the state's public school system will be one of the major problems facing the Governor. Wallwork: Believes New Jersey already spends enough money on public schools but that much of it is wasted. Says he would want the public to decide through ballot referenda on programs that would allow public money to be spent to send children to private schools. Mr. Wallwork's daughter attended both public and private schools when she was growing up. Whitman: Supports a pilot program of vouchers that would allow parents to use public funds to send their children to private or parochial schools if they desired. Mrs. Whitman's two children, a 15-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son, have always attended private schools. Edwards: Proposes replacing centralized state control of education with community-designed schools for each of the state's 611 school districts to replace the centralized control by the state. Favors what he calls charter schools, which would allow each school district to tailor its curriculum. Opposes spending public funds on vouchers and other programs to send children to private or parochial schools. Mr. Edwards' youngest daughter, a 16-year-old, attends public school, as did his other daughter, who is now an adult. Each of the daughters attended at least one year of private school. CRIME The candidates all support the death penalty. Each favors boot camps for juvenile offenders. Wallwork: Would convert Fort Dix and Fort McGuire into penal institutions for juveniles and first-time offenders run by former military personnel. Says the prime way to combat crime is to create jobs. Whitman: Advocates amending state laws to permit a jury to learn about the effect of a murder on the victim's family and to consider the defendant's criminal record; increasing criminal penalties for child abuse; establishing an automobile theft prevention authority. Edwards: Proposes establishing ""Gun-Free School Zones,"" putting 4,000 more police officers on the streets, setting mandatory sentences for crimes against senior citizens and creating a firearms strike force to get illegal guns off the street.",1993-05-16T05:00:00+0000

Though the streets no longer throng six months a year with Carnival's masked revelers, though the famous gambling casinos and courtesans are gone, the daily spectacle of watching ordinary life unfold here remains one of the city's great joys. Part of this is simply to do with Venice's beauty generally as a setting: flat water, a pale moon, the silhouettes of domes, balconies and battlements. But much of the delight of watching the city go about its business -- as if this were all a performance arranged specially for our amusement -- must be credited to how well Venice's public squares actually function as places to meet, speak, stroll, eat and work.",1993-05-16T05:00:00+0000

In sterling silver, silver or gold plate, and pewter, they are created by designers of jewelry, home accessories and furniture and by metalsmiths. And there is enough variety to please any grandparent, godparent or great-aunt (those most often relied on to buy the heirloom-to-be). Izabel Lam, who does much of her own welding at her studio in Long Island City, Queens, produced unusual seahorse-shaped spoons in cast metal. Spoons by Michael Lammers, a metalsmith, are also rattles; they are $100 at Julian & Sara, 103 Mercer Street (at Spring Street). Tiffany's still carries plain sterling silver cups at $170 but has jazzed up its line with Elsa Peretti's sleek, seal-like designs. Bergdorf Goodman has traditional cups and spoons as well as heavily detailed vintage styles circa 1910 to 1930 -- for those who want an instant heirloom.",1993-05-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Portraits in Oil,"Corporate advertising in Britain was once a high art. During the teens, 20's and 30's -- the golden age of the European poster -- a variety of English businesses, even the Government itself, employed some of the finest graphic designers and painters to promote products, services and ideas. This was not the hard sell we have come to expect from advertising agencies today; quite often the works were masterpieces of painterly form and typographic elegance. One corporation, Shell Oil, stood out for its inventiveness. THE SHELL POSTER BOOK (Godine, paper, $19.95), a collection of the company's finest posters from 1920 to 1952, shows that good design was good business. The company's poster tradition can be credited to one employee, Jack Beddington, who, despite lack of experience, was placed in charge of advertising after he complained that the company's promotions were mundane. Under his leadership, Shell's ads were transformed from crass and copy-driven to elegant image-dominated posters with catchy phrases. Styles ranged from the rectilinear Art Moderne renderings depicting speed by Tom Purvis, to modern country landscapes by Graham Sutherland, Paul Nash and Vanessa Bell, to the Surrealist fantasies of E. McKnight Kauffer and Zero (Hans Schleger). There were also frequent experiments with Cubist, Expressionist and cartoon styles by veteran and neophyte artists alike. By the early 50's the quality of the posters had begun to decline, a situation caused as much by the passing of the great artists as by changes in corporate priorities. As slick as later advertising became, however, it does not surpass the individuality and originality of the posters produced when Shell was fueled by art.",1993-05-23T05:00:00+0000

us,NAME-DROPPER,"In ""Name-Dropper"" (Hers, May 2), Susan Ferraro states that it is irrelevant whether or not a woman keeps her name when she gets married, since the name inevitably came from her father. To me, that's not the point. My birth name bears no resemblance to the name my great-grandfather used when he entered this country, so I can't pretend that keeping it is enabling me to carry on my family's history. However, it is the name by which people knew me for 24 years before I married, and it is part of my identity. Try to imagine a man writing an essay about how changing his name helped him leave his parents behind and establish his individuality; it seems so absurd that one wonders why it's acceptable for a woman to do so.

us,The Death of Eros,"The word ""love"" now applies to almost everything except the overwhelming attraction of one individual for another. And sex is a timid pseudoscientific word which tells us only that individuals have certain bodily needs. There is an appalling matter-of-factness in public speech about sex today. On television, schoolchildren tell us about how they will now use condoms in their contacts -- I was about to say adventures, but that would be overstating their significance. On talk shows, young collegians tell us about how they decide whether they have been raped in their various encounters. There is nothing in these tales of the now-impossible complaint about outraged virginity. Sex is spoken of coolly and without any remains of the old puritanical shame, as an incidental aspect of the important questions of disease and power. The sexual talk of our times is about how to get greater bodily satisfaction or how to protect ourselves from one another. The old view was that delicacy of language was part of the nature, the sacred nature, of eros, and that to speak about it in any other way would be to misunderstand it. What has disappeared is the risk and the hope of human connectedness embedded in eros. Ours is a language that reduces the longing for another to the need for individual, private satisfaction and safety.",1993-05-23T05:00:00+0000

Margaret Bourke-White's 1936 photo of Fort Peck Dam in Montana (above) adorned the first cover of Life magazine, capturing in its ragged symmetry the pure drama of Art Deco design. F.D.R. was so impressed with the potential magnificence and employment opportunities of dams that he made building them the key to his recovery plan out west.

Sampras, ranked No. 1 in the world, defeated Michael Stich, 6-4, 6-2, and Chang clinched the title by downing Carl-Uwe Steeb, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), in the clay-court event.

Stich and Sampras, both serve-and-volley-specialists, played on even terms before the American capitalized on the only service-break opportunity to win the first set. Sampras wore down the 10th-ranked Stich in the second set, breaking him twice for a 4-0 lead.

Baffi scored his first victory this season by covering the 141.9-mile distance from Grosseto to Rieti in 5 hours 52 minutes 54 seconds, an average speed of 23.610 miles an hour.

The second stage was almost flat, except for a high hill about five miles from the finish. In the overall standings, Argentin leads runner-up Maurizio Fondriest of Italy by 36 seconds and the third-place Indurain, of Spain, by 38.

Brett Bartkewicz paced a 21-hit attack with five singles and Jason Loscalzo had four hits including a home run as St. John's beat George Mason, 16-9, yesterday in a loser-out game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association West Regional in Tempe, Ariz. St. John's (26-19), which also got three doubles and a single from Anthony D'Esposito, made five errors in the first two innings and fell behind by 3-0 before staying alive in the double-elimination regional, getting five unearned runs against George Mason (33-15) in the fifth. Redmen starter C. J. Nitkowski (6-3) struck out 10 and allowed two earned runs over seven and two-thirds innings. (AP) Fordham Loses in Midwest: Top-seeded North Carolina State took advantage of Fordham's porous defense in the first three innings and went on to a 12-4 victory in the first round of the Midwest Regional in Stillwater, Okla. The Wolfpack (48-15) scored five unearned runs in the first inning after Fordham starter Ramon Hernandez was within one pitch of getting out of the inning. Four more unearned runs in the third put the game out of reach. Fordham (31-26) next plays the loser of last night's game between Oklahoma State and Connecticut. (AP) Rutgers Loses One: In Knoxville, Tenn., Clemson won, 7-3, to hand Rutgers its first loss in the Mideast Regional.

(AP) GOLF Clearwater Shoots a 61, and He's in Third Fulton Allem weathered a record-setting performance by Keith Clearwater and established a one-stroke lead yesterday in the storm-delayed second round of the Southwestern Bell Colonial in Fort Worth, Tex. Allem birdied the final hole from 25 feet to cap a seven-under 63 and set a tournament record of 11-under-par 129 over the first 36 holes. Clearwater birdied the last seven holes -- averaging more than 20 feet a putt while falling one short of the PGA Tour record -- for a 61 on the 7,010-yard Colonial course. His 61 was a course and tournament record, and a score that has been bettered only 10 times in the history of the American tour, a pair of 59's by Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, and eight scores of 60. With a 132 total, however, Clearwater trailed both Allem and Dick Mast, who shot 66 and was a stroke off the pace on a day the course was robbed of its natural defenses by gentle breezes and greens slowed and softened by a day-long series of showers. In a group at 133, one behind Clearwater, were Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Russ Cochran, Mark Calcavecchia and Jeff Maggert. (AP) Two Eagles for Robbins: Kelly Robbins had two eagles in a four-under-par 68 yesterday to take sole possession of the lead after two rounds of the L.P.G.A. Corning Classic in Corning, N.Y.. Robbins, who started the round in a three-way tie for the lead, has a 36-hole total of 138, one stroke in front of Hiromi Kobayashi of Japan, who also shot a 68.

Golf Club, Steve Murphy and Jim Turnesa thought their chances of winning the 22d annual tournament for a third time were minimal. The twosome from the Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford finished the first 18 with a two-under-par 70 that put them in seventh place, seven strokes off the leaders, John Baldwin and Peter Van Ingen of the Meadow Brook Country Club on Long Island. But Murphy and Turnesa combined for a 65 on the back to finish with a 135 and earn the victory by a stroke as Baldwin and Van Ingen scored a 73 and fell into a second-place tie at 136.

us,Business Diary,"THE ECONOMY Round One of the Budget Battle Goes to Clinton After a long wait, Bill Clinton enjoyed a significant victory, albeit by a weak margin, when the House passed, 219 to 213, the President's budget plan. Approval was seen as a prerequisite if Mr. Clinton hopes to have any clout on the rest of his agenda: health care, trade and so on. The plan that passed includes what is by some measures the largest tax increase ever, with the goal of accomplishing what may be the greatest Federal deficit reduction ever. The taxes come in several varieties and are likely to affect all but the very poorest people. In addition, spending on automatic benefit programs will be reduced by almost $100 billion and freezes in discretionary spending are supposed to save about $100 billion more over five years. Mr. Clinton pushed hard for this victory, giving in on some details, but retaining most of what he wanted. Still, the House vote was seen as the easy one, and a number of Senators are determined to amend the plan. The Growth Engine Sputters The United States economy, which was cruising along at a growth rate of 4.7 percent in the last quarter of 1992, misfired in the first quarter of this year even more badly than was previously thought, the Government disclosed. It now appears that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in January through March. That was only half the 1.8 percent rate estimated a month ago. It was the weakest economic growth since the fourth quarter of 1991. A Tumble in Public Confidence In the Conference Board's latest survey, the public's confidence has fallen to its lowest level since before the presidential election. Only 13 percent think jobs will be more plentiful in six months than they are now, for instance; it was the lowest level in a year. But if people are losing hope for the future, they are not so gloomy about current economic conditions. The current-conditions index remained a good deal higher than it was in October. As Norma Pace, president of WEFA's Economic Consulting and Planning in New York, put it, ""The index is an accurate reflection of how consumers feel, but it's not a good reflection of how they spend."" The Fed Can't Stop The Drop The Federal Reserve intervened to try to stop the decline of the dollar against the yen on Thursday and Friday, but it was not enough to keep the United States currency from establishing record lows. That is because many traders believed Washington is not all that uneasy with the idea of a stronger yen, which could lead to a decrease in the American trade deficit with Japan. By late in the week, however, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Lawrence H. Summers, said, ""The market has moved too far, too fast."" How far and how fast? It took 125 yen to buy a dollar in January; for a while on Friday, it took fewer than 107. Layoff Notices Not Required A Federal judge has ruled that the General Dynamics Corporation did not have to follow the law requiring that workers be given 60 days' notice before being laid off. The case involved a mass layoff in 1991 after the Navy canceled a warplane program. Other companies must deal with the competitive marketplace, natural disasters and economic cycles and still must warn their workers of possible layoffs. But military contractors have a bigger burden. They do business with the Federal Government. A Short HDTV Honeymoon As it became clear that the three research teams competing to develop high definition television, known as HDTV, in the United States all had worthy technologies, the focus shifted to nontechnological matters, including jobs. So, there was a sense of relief when the rivals agreed last week to join forces, presumably heading off lawsuits by those not chosen. But the euphoria was shortlived. Experts quickly suggested that it might be impossible to reconcile crucial technical issues without alienating television equipment companies or computer companies. INTERNATIONAL Renault, After the Socialists When the Socialists held the reins in France, they stopped the privatization of Government-owned companies. But now the Socialists are gone, and the new Prime Minister has designated 21 companies for privatization, starting next fall. Added to the list for the first time was Renault, which has done surprisingly well in the crowded European auto market. In Default? The Aga Khan? Among the world's rich and famous, there are few people as rich and as famous as the Aga Khan. But this counts for little these days in Italy. When the Aga Khan's investments in luxury resorts faltered and his main holding company failed to make a loan payment, his creditors moved to seize assets, and the Milan stock exchange suspended trading in his companies. Another Chance for China As a candidate, Bill Clinton lacerated George Bush for not using trade as a lever to improve human rights in China. But as President, Mr. Clinton has not deployed his main weapon: China's ""most favored nation"" trade status. He will give Beijing another year to make progress on rights. COMPANIES Time on Their Side Since Time took Warner as a partner, there have been periodic reports that the company was looking for well-heeled investors. Now they are starting to appear. Earlier this month, U S West said it would take a 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment. Then Seagram unexpectedly disclosed that it had acquired 5.7 percent of Time Warner's stock and wanted to accumulate 15 percent. Time Warner professed to be delighted, although it was not immediately clear what it might gain from a closer relationship with a Canadian liquor and fruit juice company. Crossing Paths Again Before Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts took RJR Nabisco private for $25 billion, one of its biggest deals was a $6 billion buyout of Beatrice. But it was not a particularly happy deal for Kohlberg, which finally sold the company to Conagra, headed by Charles M. Harper. But Kohlberg, Kravis must have been impressed by Mr. Harper's performance because it has now turned to him to become chief executive of RJR Nabisco. Looking Under The Rock At Prudential Securities, insiders say, some high-commission brokers in the booming Dallas branch ran amok from the mid-80's until last summer. Among other things, they are said to have purchased securities without authorization and forged clients' signatures. Now the S.E.C. is reported to be investigating whether the firm has violated a 1986 settlement involving earlier complaints that its supervisors had failed to do their jobs. Rendezvous in Hog Heaven Harley-Davidson, which has roared past its competitors by improving the quality of its motorcycles and promoting the joy of the open road, is about to celebrate its 90th anniversary with festivities in Milwaukee on June 12. To get the expected 60,000 bikers to the blast on time, the company has mapped out 10 paths to Milwaukee and the company is assigning high-ranking executives to serve as ride hosts for the various routes. Its chief executive, Richard Teerlink, for instance, is leading the caravan from San Francisco. A Dip at Dell... In the folklore of the computer industry, the story of the rise of Dell Computer is one of the standards. Hatched in a University of Texas dormitory room by 19-year-old Michael Dell, the company has grown in less than a decade to be the fourth-largest personal computer maker. But now Dell has had its wings clipped. The company reported first-quarter profits that were half of the previous year's even though revenues were sharply higher. The big problem was that the company had failed to keep up in the fast-growing notebook-computer market. For the week Dell's stock plunged $9 a share, or more than 27 percent. ...And an AST Acquisition Dell may soon be unseated as No. 4 in the PC business by AST Research, based in Irvine, Calif. AST has agreed to buy the money-losing TE Electronics, the computer-manufacturing subsidiary of the Tandy Corporation. Tandy had previously announced that it would spin off TE at the beginning of July as a separately traded company. For AST, the purchase is a chance to acquire manufacturing capacity. Tandy wants to concentrate on its Radio Shack stores and other retail operations. But the sale also removes a pioneer of the PC industry. There was a time a decade or more ago when Tandy -- along with Commodore and Atari -- was one of the leaders in the industry.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
A Gospel of Pain","""I felt as if a scream was going through nature -- I thought I heard a scream,"" the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch wrote in his diary one evening, after watching the sun set blood-red across an Oslo fjord. He translated that impression into one of the most powerful images of head-spinning anxiety ever created, ""The Scream"" (1893). Munch (1863-1944), who lived by what he once described as a gospel of pain, expressed the anguish of broken relations, death and illness, isolation and despair in a continuing project, ""The Frieze of Life."" This thematic series of paintings, which includes such famous works as ""The Dance of Life"" (1900) as well as ""The Scream,"" was first exhibited in 1902 and again, with new pictures, in 1913 and 1918. All 85 paintings are reproduced in EDVARD MUNCH: The Frieze of Life (National Gallery Publications/Abrams, $45); unfortunately, the color is disappointingly muddy. Happily, however, four excellent essays examine aspects of Munch's tempestuous life and proto-Expressionist style. Reinhold Heller, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago, writes entertainingly of the bohemian cafe set in Oslo, where heady discussions of Nietzsche, free love and free thought inspired both Munch and Strindberg to test their limits in a debilitating cycle of drink and problematic affairs that often ended in abandonment, coercion and emotional abuse. Not surprisingly, Munch's women are often either Magdalenes or Madonnas -- lustful, ruined women or prepubescent innocents -- who entwine men in tangles of overpowering feeling. However, Munch's images do not add up to a pessimistic vision of blind despair. His subjects are often caught in a moment not just of pain but of awakening and awareness, as in ""Desire"" (1907), in which a woman looks up in horror as a man buries his face in her bosom. An element of mystery -- what unsettling truth has pressed its way into her mind? -- saves the image from hopeless melodrama. And that is a condition, this book makes plain, that Munch's work, and life, sailed dangerously near.",1993-05-30T05:00:00+0000
