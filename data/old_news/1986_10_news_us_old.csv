us,"Gaelic Football, Of a Sort","Here are the clues for today's problem in creative logic: 1. Boston has strong ties to Ireland, so strong, in fact, that during the tourist season Aer Lingus needs three flights a week from Boston to Dublin just to accommodate the area's Irish-American residents clamoring to return to the old sod. 2. West Point, given the nation's NATO commitments, probably has more alumni living in Western Europe than does any other American college. 3. One of the hardships inflicted on American Army officers by such overseas duty is the absence of American football. 4. Boston College and Army play each other in football just about every year. 5. One of Dublin's main stadiums, Lansdowne Road, doesn't have an insurmountable commitment to rugby or Gaelic football for Nov. 19, 1988, when Army and B.C. are scheduled to meet. 6. What Lansdowne Road does have is room for 55,000 football fans, whether they be visiting Bostonians, American Army officers or locals curious to see what the American game is all about. 7. Several major American corporations with big advertising budgets and a yen for sponsoring sports events (Ford, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Budweiser come to mind) have operations in Ireland. 8. Jim O'Brien, a former Boston College tackle who's now a marketing representative and a frequent visitor to Ireland, considered all the above and had an idea. 9. Boston College's athletic director, Bill Flynn, thought it was a terrific idea, and so did Army's athletic director, Carl Ullrich. 10.",1986-10-01T05:00:00+0000

It's an extraordinarily spry and witty film from a director who, on the evidence of ''Going Places'' and ''Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,'' has never regarded charming his audiences as much of a priority. Indeed, Mr. Blier has said in interviews that it disappoints him when his films fail to provoke indignation. So in terms of sheer shock value, ''Menage'' may seem some slight comedown (though this director, whose great love of sexually explicit dialogue has not left him, will never be accused of gentility). In all other respects, it is Mr. Blier's most satisfying work.",1986-10-01T05:00:00+0000

In her last novel, ''The Killing Ground'' - the fifth and concluding volume of a cycle of historical novels called ''The Beulah Quintet'' - Mary Lee Settle examined the reasons her heroine, one Hannah McKarkle, had decided to become a novelist, and she traced the impulse back to Hannah's need to understand her brother's death, her need to make sense of her own losses and her family's past through the redemptive art of storytelling. Though the backdrop to her latest novel could hardly be more different - swinging London of the 1960's, instead of the American South - this same theme reverberates through its pages. The characters in ''Celebration'' not only count themselves as survivors of emotional trauma (deaths, betrayals and other defections of the heart), but they also emerge as inveterate storytellers, jabbering away to one another - and to us - about their fears, grievances and dreams.",1986-10-04T05:00:00+0000

And he, as though waiting for the question, immediately replied: ''What is this 'no-peace-and-no-war'? This is a Jewish invention.

And in Alistair Blair's strictly tailored fingertip jacket worn over a saucy black-and-white bustier and cropped pants. It exists in Joseph Tricot's classic cardigan, which is casually slung over a modern, oversize striped pullover and tubular knit skirt. It surfaces in Jean Muir's ladylike button-front dress, paired with a Turkish embroidered cap.",1986-10-05T05:00:00+0000

In recent years, the ''Ring'' has been treated, even at Bayreuth, as a springboard off which trendy stage directors and designers could perform their nip-ups and full gainers, creating splashes of spectacular irrelevancy. The Metropolitan's ''Tannhauser'' bucked that trend, looking back into Wagnerian history for pictorial inspirations and paying honor to the work's spirit without seeming in any way old-fashioned. Thanks to skillful use of modern stage technology, direction fit into the pictures naturally, suggesting a 19th-century staging even while eliminating its worst cliches or softening them almost beyond recognition. Everything seemed to flow from the music, not from a producer's bag of tricks. In other words, Mr. Schenk and Mr. Schneider-Siemssen achieved stylistic consistency, that chimerical fusion of elements that in Wagnerian dogma is called the Gesamtkunstwerke, or complete art work.",1986-10-05T05:00:00+0000

Philips, the international industrial conglomerate, is said to employ around 10 percent of its population of more than 200,000, and it has heavy commitments in cigars, paper, trucks and dairy products. It has a strong musical life. It has good theater. It has, in the Karpendonkse Hoeve, one of the best restaurants in the country. It has corporate patrons - the present show is sponsored both by Philips and by Hofnar, the cigar manufacturers, with supplementary contributions from Daf Trucks and Philip Morris.

us,FORCING BANKS TO MARK DOWN LOANS,"MANY Latin American countries became debt junkies during the decade of the 1970's. Now these countries claim that they cannot maintain their habits. In an attempt to keep the debtors addicted and to give the illusion that creditors are in perfect health, our financial alchemists have devised a virtual international Ponzi scheme. Here's how it works: If, after 90 days, interest due is not paid, loans must be placed in ''non-accrual status.'' At the same time, these loans are often declared ''non-performing'' and written down. But, to avoid these unpleasantries, banks have taken to rescheduling loans. In addition to reducing the servicing costs and extending the life of old loans, this procedure typically requires creditors to lend new money, which gives debtors the money to pay interest owed on old loans. As a result of these maneuvers, debts grow; loans continue to ''perform'' and are carried on the books at face value; and bank profits are realized.",1986-10-05T05:00:00+0000

C., called for radical changes in the public schools and sought to assume the lead in effecting reform. They acknowledged that many of their proposals - such as more pay and higher standards for teachers, new taxes for education and state authority to take over school districts that do not meet minimum standards - would be difficult to achieve. One Governor who could report success, however, was Richard W. Riley of South Carolina, who initiated sweeping changes for elementary and secondary schools three years ago. These included state authority to take over inferior districts and a one-cent sales tax increase to pay for new programs. In a recent exchange with faculty members at the Governors Center of Duke University, Mr. Riley, a Democrat, discussed his experience in South Carolina, where the constitution gives the Legislature rather than the governor prime authority. Excerpts follow. Question. You have outlined how you approached different policy problems. I see three things in your examples: First was creating a large, active, representative group to forge new policy directions. The second part seemed to be to take this public.

us,SMALL THINGS COUNT,"TRUE FREEDOM IS THE freedom to enjoy a private life. A private life is made up of atomic particles hard to make public. One of the troubles with travel these days is that it is all too public - great tourist buses, a huge collection of luggage piled in a hotel lobby, an abstract schedule of visits, the plastic of the tourist menu. We go home somehow diminished, having surrendered our idiosyncracies to the generalized public image of the 20th-Century Traveler. We ought to seek out and cherish the minutiae of the world. It is the only way to bring that world to life. Otherwise it is as dead as an atlas. T. S. Eliot could never forget the sight of an old white horse galloping away in a meadow: it seemed to hold some mysterious meaning beyond itself, hard to fathom but undoubtedly significant. James Joyce talked of epiphanies - meaning the sudden flashes of truth that come in the lighting of a cigarette or the scratching of a pimple. Small things count, but we don't know why. Not knowing why, we find it easier to ignore them. When we travel we photograph the Parthenon or the Vittorio Emanuele monument. We put them into our albums or project them on a screen for our bored neighbors. The small stuff is unrecorded and forgotten.",1986-10-05T05:00:00+0000

Or is it a North Country haven where commercial travelers drink bottled Bass, exchange dirty jokes and chat up the bosomy barmaid? The ideal picture of the English pub, consistent in our fiction from Fielding to J. B. Priestley, has, of late, suffered a few rude shocks. The wayside inn may now be a brutalized drinking hole with mock pine wallpaper, pinging Space Invaders, graffiti in the loo and a smeared glass case containing one partially mummified cheese roll. Perhaps worse, it may have piped Barry Manilow in the ''Old Snug,'' pina coladas and greasy chicken and chips nestling in a checked paper napkin.

He is even in the top 10 in hitting. Nevertheless, some fans may argue that because Schmidt's team did not win the division, he should not be selected. I think, however, that a more equitable measure of whether a candidate should be considered ''most valuable'' would be to assess how his team would have fared without him. Instead of finishing in second place, the Phillies would have battled the Cubs and the Pirates for the division cellar. However, if the National League division champions did not have Gary Carter or Glenn Davis, I think each would still have won the title. DAVIS W. STARFIELD",1986-10-05T05:00:00+0000

Highland Pride","''There's naething here,'' wrote the poet Robert Burns with a diamond on the window of The Argyll Arms Hotel in Inveraray, Scotland, But Highland pride, And Highland scab and hunger; If providence has sent me here, 'Twas surely in an anger. The Argyll Arms, an elegant, white 18th-century building looking out across Loch Fyne, still stands where it did in Burns's time. Of course, as an Ayrshire man, Burns may simply have been suffering from blind, unreasoning prejudice against the Highlands and their inhabitants, though it is also possible that in those days the hospitality at The Argyll Arms left a good deal to be desired. But I am quite sure that if he were to return there today, the poet would feel obliged to eat his words.

Famously, as it happened. Lindsay Crouse, who has performed in works by both men, set the tone by noting, in her introduction, that the ''irascible, eccentric'' Mr. Foote ''is prone to violence,'' while Mr. Mamet ''is really quite shy.'' Her irony was not lost on an audience that doubtless didn't even need to be told that Miss Crouse is married to Mr. Mamet. Similarly, the actress's comment that ''we should be grateful we can hear their voices for 5 bucks instead of 60'' brought nods from listeners who knew their theater as well as their movies.

You can use any good grade of alkyd enamel, but a two-part epoxy enamel will last longest. Sold in most hardware stores, these create a tough finish that is highly resistant to abrasion and to attack by chemicals. It is important to clean the tiles first with a scouring powder, to rinse off the cleaner completely and then to follow the instructions on the can precisely. Q. The oil burner in our basement sends hot air into the house through galvanized metal ducts. Many of these ducts are in the basement, where I feel that a lot of heat is being lost. Our serviceman says insulating those ducts won't help much to increase the heat level to the rooms and is not worth the expense. What is your opinion? A. Uninsulated ducts do lose a lot of heat into the basement, but some of this heat finds its way upstairs through the walls, floors, etc. However, since the basement cold takes some of the heat out of the air inside the ducts, they are not delivering as much heat upstairs - in other words, the air coming in upstairs is not as hot as it should be.",1986-10-09T05:00:00+0000

[ Page 1, Column 6. ] Two strong earthquakes rocked several buildings in downtown San Salvador. At least 30 people were killed, according to radio reports, and several structures were reduced to twisted steel. The intensity of the two tremors was reported to have varied from 4.5 on the Richter scale to 7.0. [ 1:1-2. ] Soviet emigration has emerged as a central topic at the Reagan-Gorbachev talks. President Reagan said Soviet human rights would receive as much priority as arms control when he meets Mr. Gorbachev this weekend. The Russians have seemed to encourage expectations of liberalization on the emigration issue. [ 1:4-6. ] Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in Iceland and expressed optimism that his talks with the President would lead to steps that resolve differences between the two superpowers on arms control. ''We are prepared to look for solutions of the burning problems which concern peoples all over the world,'' he said. [ 5:5-6. ] Soviet officials held an unusual news conference on domestic issues. The session was a reflection of a spirit of self-assurance and pride about a program of domestic changes begun by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.

This is the last year that upper-income people covered by company retirement plans can make a tax-deductible contribution.

For Mary Jo Steadman, first-year student at the University of Texas, it's a comic mixture of the worst of the early 60's, the sillier side of radical feminism and the glitz of MTV. Alamo House is a residence for graduate women, a down-at-the-heels dowager right across the street from the Sigma Upsilon Kappa fraternity. While the women attempt to pull their lives together, the SUK's are busy with beer blasts, classic rock-and-roll tunes and harassing the women across the street. After breaking up with her live-in lover, Mary Jo moves into this world and befriends a beautiful acting student, Collie, and an obese Baptist, Fayrene. Mary Jo has a job at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library, sorting Presidential papers and memorabilia, including three packing crates of Luci Johnson's wedding cake. Her co-worker is Tommy, who spends his time either sleeping or composing music for new rock bands he creates on impulse. Tommy is the only male character in this novel to achieve any humanity, and he's a bright relief. As the subtitle suggests, the SUK's and other men who inhabit Sarah Bird's first novel are portrayed with all the compassion we usually reserve for cockroaches. Even the men these three women date are entries in their Weirdo of the Week contest. Eventually the women at Alamo House, galvanized by Mary Jo and Collie, have had enough.",1986-10-12T05:00:00+0000

The former doctor famous for, among other things, a ''Rigoletto'' reset in 1950's New York's Little Italy in the 1950's (a version seen at the Metropolitan Opera during the ENO visit two years ago) had the curtain rise on a white English hotel lounge of the 1920's turned surreal by the designer Stefanos Lazaridis with floating spheres and superimposed musical instruments. And, oh dear, the Gentlemen of Japan were in black frock coats and lounge suits of various eras - not a kimono in sight. There were tap-dancing maids and bellhops, Monty Python's Eric Idle as a seedy Ko-Ko delivering his first speech as if doing a radio broadcast, and Katisha (a felicitous Felicity Palmer) singing ''The Hour of Sadness'' looking like Margaret Dumont singing an art song. Katisha then prepares to fly off somewhere (presumably from the Croydon Aerodrome) at the end of Act I. If you think this ''Mikado'' sounds more like a Marx Brothers movie than the D'Oyly Carte, Mr. Miller would applaud your perception, for that was precisely part of his inspiration for this production. In an interview before the premiere, he said that he wanted another operetta fantasyland to replace Gilbert's Titipu - an alternative artificial kingdom to which modern audiences could relate. He picked a country along the lines of Freedonia in the 1933 ''Duck Soup.''",1986-10-12T05:00:00+0000

''This little book is a gem,'' The Times's reviewer, Orville Prescott, said of the title piece in 1960. Set in Florence, it is about a young American woman, mentally a child after an accident, who falls in love with an Italian. ''Its surface is so exquisitely polished that at first glance one might be tempted to dismiss it as slight and insubstantial,'' Mr. Prescott said, but ''the more one thinks about it the more subtle, suggestive and ironic it becomes.'' RECOLLECTIONS, by Colette. Translated by David Le Vay. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) Brought together here are two collections of sketches and memoirs, ''Journey for Myself'' and ''The Evening Star.'' The first cele-brates and sends up the fashions and fads of Parisian life; the second is Colette's musings on people, places and events. She approaches her subjects as mysteries in ''Journey for Myself,'' Nancy Hale wrote in these pages in 1972, ''and to tell the conclusions . . . she comes to . . . would be like giving away the secret of a mystery story.'' Reviewing ''The Evening Star'' for The Times in 1974, Anatole Broyard said that Colette ''writes like someone humming to herself, someone pleasantly insomniac, watching images and memories pass before her eyes.''

Or can one stop and, after a minute's meditation, nod in quiet assent? A more immediate consideration might be more relevant.

Altogether the company employs 50 people, mainly chemists who work in the laboratories and skilled laborers on the floor of the plant. The production machinery, the row of storage tanks, the laboratory building, the finished product in man-sized containers ready to be shipped, the reprocessing facility that purifies the wastes - all of it is encompassed in four or five acres a seven-mile drive from Turin. The machines that are drying resin and blending varnish and pumping off pollutants are never really distressingly loud, the yard's acrid odor - the smell, Levi told me, that clung to his clothing for two years after his retirement - is by no means disgusting, and the skip loaded with the black sludgy residue of the antipolluting process isn't particularly unsightly. It is hardly the world's ugliest industrial environment, but a very long way, nonetheless, from those sentences suffused with mind that are the hallmark of Levi's autobiographical narratives. On the other hand, however far from the prose, it is clearly a place close to his heart; taking in what I could of the noise, the stench, the mosaic of pipes and vats and tanks and dials, I remembered Faussone, the skilled rigger in ''The Monkey's Wrench,'' saying to Levi - who calls Faussone ''my alter ego'' - ''I have to tell you, being around a work site is something I enjoy.''",1986-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Readers may sigh appreciatively, mutter discontentment, or even slam the cover shut, but the author hears none of it. His professional colleagues may respond in print, but what of the common reader whose curiosity, intelligence and pocketbook have always sustained authors? How does he make his editorial reply, turn the address into an exchange? He can write the author a letter. It ought to be a perfectly natural act. Holden Caulfield spoke some memorable good sense on the subject in ''The Catcher in the Rye'': ''What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.'' But most readers who feel the impulse let it subside, probably because they fear being intrusive or predict being rejected.",1986-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. Why do bats hang upside down? A. Bats hang upside down because it's the most convenient position for them to roost, said Dr. Merlin D. Tuttle, a biologist of Bat Conservation International. They lock their feet around the perch and their bodies pull them downward. Dr. Tuttle said a bat hanging upside down can easily drop into the air and fly away if it is disturbed. Dr. Tuttle said that, by hanging head-down, bats can use roosting places without competition from other flying animals. It's much more difficult for an animal to take shelter in the roof of a cave or building if it must roost head-up, he said. Q. Do all honeybees have stingers and if not, why aren't such ''stingless'' bees cultivated by the honey industry? A. Several species of honeybee in South America and in tropical areas do not have stingers, according to Dr. James Gould, a biologist at Princeton University. These bees have jaws they use to bite honey raiders. Some stingless bees spit an acid mixture into wounds of honey raiders, causing a painful burning sensation. Dr. Gould said some stingless bees, which can bite their victims more than once, are more aggressive than bees with stingers, which can sting only once. Stingless bees are not cultivated by honey producers because they produce far less honey than bees with stingers, Dr. Gould said. Honeybees in colder climates store great amounts of honey for use during the winter.",1986-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Shortly after the concrete set, the surface became very dusty, and walking on the floor seems to make the problem worse. The mason who built the floor told me that this was caused by high humidity and that the problem could be helped by treating the concrete with nitric acid. Can you tell me how to go about doing this? A. Washing a new concrete floor with acid is sometimes advisable to neutralize excess alkalis before painting or treating it with a sealer, but the acid used is muriatic acid (a mild form of hydrochloric acid), not nitric acid. Dusting such as you describe is sometimes a problem for a little while on new concrete, but if it continues, it usually means the mix was not right, or it was troweled too much when it was finished.",1986-10-16T05:00:00+0000

With one exception, it is a band of young but already seasoned and versatile experts in the period styles and includes Peter Ecklund's crisp cornet, Joel Helleny's colorful trombone, Orange Kellin's New Orleans clarinet and Keith Ingham's rollicking piano. They are joined by 86-year-old Freddie Moore, who played drums in the 1920's with King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton and can still give the band a strong, steady foundation. He also sings and plays washboard on such well-worn specialties as ''Bill Bailey'' and ''Sweet Georgia Brown.'' Greg Cohen is on bass.

If, however, the chefs are chatting among themselves and desultorily carving little rabbits out of daikon for mutual amusement, I head for the door.

At issue are 50 of the 4,000 textbooks used in the city's schools. The plaintiffs, a group of Christian teachers and parents supported by lawyers from a conservative foundation set up by the evangelist Pat Robertson, argue that the books, used in history and home economics classes, unconstitutionally suppress the role of religion in America and unconstitutionally advance the teachings of ''secular humanism.'' That doctrine, they say, puts man and his values, rather than God, at the center of things. They are arguing, for example, that textbook passages on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. do not pay enough attention to his religious beliefs. The State Board of Education is defending the books with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union and People for the American Way, a group set up by the television producer Norman Lear. They argue that the plaintiffs are attacking differing beliefs and have failed to count many passages on religion. The trial will continue this week.

Kurt Vonnegut populates a nature cruise with celebrities and turns it into a modern-day Noah's ark, bound for the Galapagos Islands, where its passengers will perpetuate the species after a global catastrophe. The novel is ''a madcap genealogical adventure,'' Lorrie Moore said in The Book Review last year. ''Mr. Vonnegut's grumbly and idiomatic voice has always been his own, unfakable and childlike, and his humanity, persisting as it does through his pessimism, is astonishing.'' TELLING LIES: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage, by Paul Ekman. (Berkley, $3.95.) In a study of deception and lie catching, a psychology professor at the University of California draws upon scientific studies as well as material from politics, literature and everyday life to describe how and why people lie, and why some are good liars and others aren't. In these pages last year, Carol Z. Malatesta called the work a ''fascinating account . . . accurate, intelligent, informative and thoughtful.'' A SIMPLE STORY, by S. Y. Agnon. Translated by Hillel Halkin. (Schocken, $8.95.) Originally published in Hebrew in 1935 and in English 50 years later, ''A Simple Story'' takes place at the turn of the century, as Hirshl Hurvitz, the son of wealthy Galician shopkeepers, sinks into depression and madness after he is forced to renounce his love for his impoverished cousin and accept an arranged marriage.

As they are learning, urinalysis can identify drug users easily, but it can also be intrusive, expensive and sometimes mistaken. At a forum in New York last week, experts discussed privacy issues in employment and, as to drug testing, debated what is fair, what is legal and what makes sense. The discussion was led by Arthur R. Miller, a professor at Harvard Law School and a television commentator. Among the panelists were Dr. John J. Mahoney, a medical consultant and former corporate medical director for GTE; Allan Adler, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington; Jane P.

Hine's photographs exposed the exploitation of children in the nation's textile mills; his images became weapons in the hands of the National Child Labor Committee, and the result was a Federal law enacted in 1938. In the 30's, Dorothea Lange's photographs of dispossessed migrant farm workers pricked the nation's conscience.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SERIOUS TROUBLE. By Paul Friedman (University of Illinois, $11.95.) Paul Friedman is a professor and writer in the Middle West who has surrendered the majority of this story collection to the unfocused angst of Alan Ware, a professor and writer in the Middle West. This premise could have made for a postmodern metaphysical comedy, but Mr. Friedman plays it straight. ''A Period of Grace'' shows Ware coping with the slow, painful death of his aged father, and with his suspicion that he is exploiting this death for material. ''It was abundantly clear that I couldn't write my father's story with any kind of authority, not now,'' he tells us candidly. ''It was abundantly clear I didn't even know what his story was.'' After 75 pages, despite his conscientiousness - or maybe because of it - the reader is inclined to agree. Ware's self-consciousness becomes stultifying, trivializing the very thing he tells and tells us he is trying so gamely not to trivialize. For all his earnest effort, Ware offers us a great deal more attitude than insight. The same holds true for ''The Family.'' Set in an artists' colony, it never really probes any subject but the writer's own vagaries of mood. Other stories, however, suggest that, with some distance on his material, the author can write powerfully and with deft control about people laboring to accommodate themselves to an inhospitable world. In ''An Unexpected Death'' we follow the pendulum swings of dread and hope in a man facing his own mortality.",1986-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Alicia de Larrocha: Beethoven With Poetry and Power,"However insistently artists may try to avoid being typecast, it is almost inevitable that their particular repertory specialties emerge as the labels by which we most readily identify them, often to the exclusion of music they play equally well. We think of the Spanish pianist Alicia de Larrocha, for instance, primarily as the most eloquent advocate of the music of her countrymen, and secondarily as a graceful Mozartean with respectable sidelines in Scarlatti and Bach. Yet her concert repertory has always included a broad selection of the standard Romantic solo works and concertos, and among those, the Beethoven concertos have long been close to her heart. In New York alone, she has performed these works with the New York Philharmonic, the Y Chamber Symphony, the Brooklyn Philharmonic and at Mostly Mozart; and in 1979, she played all five here as a soloist with the visiting Pittsburgh Symphony. Strangely, the only evidence of her Beethoven on disk, until now, was an ''Emperor'' Concerto with Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, released the same year as her Pittsburgh series.",1986-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ONE MORE TIME. By Carol Burnett. (Random House, $18.95.) Like all great clowns Carol Burnett has a profound respect for both the sentimental and the grotesque. She begins this affecting memoir of her childhood as an extended letter to her three daughters to explain ''just how your mom turned out to be the kind of hairpin she is.'' Raised only a block or so away from where Nathanael West placed ''The Day of the Locust,'' her family life was the very model of instability. Mother was an alcoholic. Her big dream was to write for the fan magazines but she spent most of her time in bed with a bottle and the shades pulled down. Father also drank; he sold things door-to-door when he could and died in a charity ward. This left Carol's upbringing to her maternal grandmother and it is the bond between the gawky, insecure little girl and the eccentric old woman that makes this book special. Nanny (Mabel Eudora Creighton) comes vividly to life: we see her in the one-room apartment the two of them shared, taking out her teeth to amuse the 3-year-old Carol or checking under the bed each night to make sure a man wasn't lurking. Nanny was subject to strange ailments, most particularly her ''hissy fits'' during which she clutched Mary Baker Eddy's ''Science and Health'' with one hand and downed phenobarbitals with the other. This woman is clearly just beneath the surface of all those wonderfully neurotic characters Miss Burnett created during the heyday of her television show.",1986-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Cambridge, in this revisionist view, is a blend of dream factory and success mill, filling the heads of its undergraduates with standards that they then proceed to compromise and expectations that they inevitably fail to fulfill.

A striking moment, for this listener, came at the beginning of ''Im Abendrot,'' the last of Strauss's ''Vier Letzte Lieder,'' where James Levine threw the same haul-off-and-hit fortissimo gesture that he had thrown at the Chicago Symphony about a year ago for the same piece. In Chicago, the sound he got was tense, brilliant and hard. Here, it was rich, mellow and deep. Mr. Levine is far more than a stopgap substitute for Mr. von Karajan, but we hear him a lot; the feature of the afternoon was the Berlin orchestra. From the first notes of Wagner's ''Siegfried Idyll'' - tender, affectionate, superbly balanced string playing - the tone was set. This is an orchestra that has collectively remembered to care about fineness of tone, about blend, about the beauty of a very soft sound floating through a large, acoustically receptive space. It was wonderful to hear the Vivace of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony begun with such fluent grace, and extraordinary to hear the fortissimo arrive without horns and trumpets glaring forth as though all else were background.",1986-10-20T05:00:00+0000

He was egomaniacal, treacherous with the wives and fortunes of others, thoroughly convinced that, as a superman striving to unify Germany, the world owed more to him than to ordinary mortals. He is not, therefore, the easiest subject for a biography. When not being monumentally repulsive, his behavior tends to look merely ridiculous. Separating the silly man from the gifted artist requires delicacy of the highest order. ''Wagner,'' a four-part ''Great Performances'' series beginning tonight at 9 o'clock on Channel 13, is about as delicate as a 300-pound Brunnhilde.",1986-10-24T05:00:00+0000

He introduced modern jazz musicians to Afro-Cuban rhythm and form, and, as director of Machito's Afro-Cubans, he introduced the best Cuban-rooted dance-band musicians to the fine points of modern jazz. If he can work a remotely comparable alchemy with some of the leading Afro-Cuban musicians of the post-Mariel generation, this concert will be a landmark. Tania Maria and her group are opening the show and along for the ride. The concert takes place tomorrow night at 8 at Town Hall.

London charged that Syrian diplomats and agents were involved. #1 Syria ended relations with Britain and closed its ports to British aircraft and ships. The announcement, which came after London's action, gave British diplomats one week to leave the country. #4 A Jordanian journalist was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison for trying to blow up the Israeli airliner. A jury found that Nezar Hindawi, 32, had hidden a bomb in his lover's luggage. #4 The U.S. will also withdraw its Ambassador to Syria, William L. Eagleton Jr., as a show of support for Britain's decision to break relations with Damascus, the White House announced. #4 Syria called effective with terror 1 Tales of corruption in Mexico are legion among Mexican citizens, virtually all of whom say they have paid bribes for such things as avoiding a traffic ticket or speeding service in a government matter.#3 A Nicaraguan rebel group diverted $15,000 in U.S. funds to buy ammunition earlier this year, Congressional and Administration officials said. The money was intended for nonlethal aid. #3 Western newspapers are critical of the back-and-forth expulsions of diplomats by the U.S. and the Kremlin. Many commentators have voiced concern that the withdrawals may derail disarmament efforts, but European leaders remain silent. 5 News analysis: Summit issues 1 U.S. takes steps at embassy 1 Focus of disinformation inquiry 3 The Nation The largest paid acreage reduction program in history was announced.",1986-10-25T05:00:00+0000

Though one might dispute Louis Auchincloss's contention that the novel ''is really the last of her major fictions'' - it marks a precipitous falling off from ''The Age of Innocence,'' published five years earlier - it does stand as a sort of transitional piece between her masterly early work and the trite, blowsy effusions that were to follow.",1986-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Q AND A,"Charter Flights Question:Do you know of any charter flights going from New York to Rome? - E. H., Yonkers Answer:Weekly charter flights to Rome can be booked through Fantasy Holidays (366 North Broadway, Jericho, N.Y. 11753; 516-935-2970) or, out of state, 800-645-2555). The flights, departing Friday evenings from Kennedy Airport and going via Paris, are on Boeing 707's of Skystar International, the New Jersey-based charter service. Return flights are on Saturdays. Round-trip fares are $398 on some dates and $498 on others and rise to $598 for the Christmas period. The lower rates generally apply to November and January, when demand for seats is lower. (On Alitalia, the Italian airline, a 21-day, advance-purchase fare from New York to Rome costs, from Nov. 1, $729 on weekdays and $779, weekends, round trip, nonstop.) Fantasy operates a year-round program to Rome; in spring the service is expected to continue with nonstop flights on another charter airline, Tower Air. The company also offers packages of air fare and seven nights' accommodations in the city, starting at $499 a person. This is generally a slow time of year for charter flights to Europe, and this past season has not been busy. It is expected that other operators will be offering charters to Rome from next April.",1986-10-26T05:00:00+0000

Also distinguished from insurgency forces. Cruise missile. A low-flying missile that looks like a flying torpedo, it is powered by an air-breathing engine and is armed with either nuclear or nonnuclear warheads.

Page 1 The White House restated its position that Mr. Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev had discussed the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but that the talks had never reached even a tentative agreement. #12 Britain called on the Soviet Union to announce publicly its rejection of state-supported terrorism. The request came after London said it had evidence that Syria was involved in an El Al bomb plot. #1 British agents eavesdropped on conversations verifying the complicity of the Syrian Ambassador in the plot to bomb an Israeli airliner, according to Government officials. #6 A vote to oust the South African delegation from a Red Cross conference was made as a protest to apartheid, many countries said.

''It is a view of the world where love is a commodity and perfunctory, where the gulfs between humans are not only vast but are also taken for granted as permanent.'' WEST WITH THE NIGHT, by Beryl Markham. (North Point, $12.50.) Born in England and raised in Kenya, the author and aviator Beryl Markham (1902-1986) was the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west and the first professional female bush pilot in Africa. This memoir of her Kenyan childhood and her historic flight ''is quite unlike anything that has been written by any other woman or about Africa, its natives, its hunting and its future by anybody,'' our reviewer, Jane Spence Southron, said in 1942. The work, she said, ''written with exceptional, simple beauty,'' is ''all the more thrilling for being true.'' Another African memoir, A TOURIST IN AFRICA by Evelyn Waugh (Little, Brown; paper, $7.95; cloth, $15.95), is the British novelist's diary of a two-month trip to Central Africa in 1959. Our reviewer, Elspeth Huxley, said in 1960 that ''a crumb from Mr. Waugh's table remains more appetizing and, in a curious way, more nourishing than a whole meal from the groaning platter of most earnest, informative newshawks and television teams.''",1986-10-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Q & A,"Q.We have a shallow water well at our country home and the pump is in the basement. Although the house is winterized and heated, the water line comes pretty close to the surface as it approaches the well house. The water line at this point is surrounded by the remnants of foam insulation, and since this was once a year-round farm I assume this was enough to protect the line against freezing. Still, I'm worried. Will this insulation be enough, or must we take other precautions? A.Normally, insulation alone is not enough to protect an exposed water line against freezing. Eventually the cold will get through unless the water line is in frequent use. Such lines should normally be buried below the frost line to prevent this. An alternative is to wrap the pipe with electrical heating tape that is turned on only when the thermometer goes below freezing. Insulation is then wrapped around the outside. Q.I live in a co-op apartment where walls, floors and ceilings are made of poured concrete. There are spaces in the corners where the walls and the ceiling meet, apparently due to expansion and contraction of the structure. I would like to cover these openings, and saw an ad for plastic mouldings that looked like they would be easy to install. Do you know how these are attached or installed, and would they cover up the cracks or open seams? A.The type of moulding you are referring to is made of moulded polystyrene and is usually attached to walls, ceilings and other surfaces with a special cement that the manufacturer sells.",1986-10-30T05:00:00+0000
