I fancied I could hear old Gibbon grumbling down there in my pocket.

Modern architecture was not just the International Style and the Bauhaus, in other words - it was not just glass boxes and harsh concrete battlements. Not that there were not plenty of those - if there hadn't been, Modernism would surely not have gotten the bad name it has come in recent years to acquire.

us,MOVING TO BREAK THE OLD 'FORMAT' MOLDS,"American creativity may have lost ground to foreign agencies, but there are signs that a few of Madison Avenue's clients are making efforts to break out of the old molds and gamble on more imaginative advertising. New advertising tacks, such as those recently taken by Anacin, Prudential, Nike, Shasta and even Aim toothpaste, strike a blow at advertising's dreaded ''format.'' David K. Vadehra, president of the commercial-testing company Video Storyboard Tests, says that ''the hard sell started with advertisers shouting at you. But the only result for some of them was that they got hoarse. So they tried singing and dancing, and the soft sell began.'' Further distinctions led to ''category formats,'' Mr. Vadehra continues, in which many brands relied on responsible but predictable ''me-too'' advertising. ''Analgesics used hard-sell spokesmen and charts,'' he says. ''Soft drinks gave kids the spice of life - singing and dancing together on a beach - while household cleaners showed tormented housewives how they could have an easier slice of life.'' Malcolm D. MacDougall, whose creative background has taken him to the presidency of SSC&B, says that many advertisers can no longer grow inside these ''format straitjackets.'' Look-alike advertising - where all competitors in a market, say, detergents, are advertised in the same way - might be effective when the market for detergents is expanding. But when the demand for detergent levels off, a company seeking to increase its market share must take sales away from its competitors. To do that, Mr. MacDougall maintains, ''advertising salesmanship has to become creative.''",1983-12-04T05:00:00+0000

They generally regard work and independence as elements of life that are as satisfying as husbands, homes and children. The poll showed that men and women are growing much closer in their attitudes toward work outside the home, pointing up a dramatic shift since 1970, when a national poll sponsored by Virginia Slims found women cleaving to hearth and home. Thirteen years ago, 53 percent of the women surveyed cited motherhood as one of the best parts of being a woman, for example, and in the latest poll just 26 percent did. Work outside the home was more peripheral then, with only 9 percent of the women even listing it as an enjoyable part of their lives. This time, 26 percent did. Among the other key findings in the telephone poll of 1,309 adult men and women, conducted Nov. 11-20, were these: -Even if they could afford it, 58 percent of American working women would rather work than stay home; so would 31 percent of nonworking women. But while 70 percent of men in blue-collar jobs said they would rather work, just 43 percent of women in such jobs said so. They included factory workers, maids and waitresses. Forty-eight percent of working men were in blue-collar jobs, as were 27 percent of working women. -Forty-four percent of American working women said they had been discriminated against in the workplace, either in the present or former job.",1983-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Indeed, a recent television documentary claimed that more than 80 percent of Orwell's predictions about a nightmarish, centralized, all-seeing bureaucracy have already come true in contemporary America. A plethora of articles invoke Orwellian terms in order to denounce not only authoritarian regimes but also manifestations in Western societies: Military jargon and bureaucratic euphemism are the ''Newspeak'' issued by the equivalents of the ''Ministry of Truth''; modern methods of electronic surveillance, computerized data and closed-circuit TV are the relatives of ''Big Brother''; and anyone who dares challenge these simplistic analogies is guilty of ''Doublethink.''",1983-12-04T05:00:00+0000

She was 28 years old. Her death in 1974 - as subsequently told in books, articles, plays and now a major motion picture - is a tale of nuclear martyrdom in which her employer is key suspect. Miss Silkwood allegedly had documents, never found, that would have embarrassed her employer, the Kerr- McGee Corporation, a rich, powerful energy-based conglomerate that ran a factory, since closed, near Crescent, Okla., for fabricating nuclear fuel out of plutonium, one of the world's most deadly poisons. In ''Silkwood,'' opening Wednesday at Loews Tower East, the National and local theaters, Meryl Streep plays a redneck turned union activist who swears a lot, sleeps around, and pops pills in the course of her quest to expose Kerr-McGee. The dramatic effectiveness of ''Silkwood'' as a film will have to be left to the critics to judge; as a depiction of a scientific subject, however, it can be faulted.",1983-12-11T05:00:00+0000

Sandra (Ray Wise) is a flamboyant tranvestite, as addicted to sex as Manon is to religion. Manon's fervor eventually becomes orgiastic. Sandra's lustfulness has a rhapsodic spirituality.

Within the past few weeks, for example, the California Coastal Conservancy has clearly seen how a group of eight-story, as opposed to three-story, buildings would look against Berkeley's hilly shoreline - and construction hasn't even started. The technique is known as simulation, and its leading practitioner in the United States is the Environmental Simulation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. At the heart of the laboratory, which covers 1,250 square feet, is a camera mounted on ceiling tracks. A computer moves the camera horizontally and vertically above scale models - 30 feet to the inch - of cities or neighborhoods in which designers have placed a working model of a proposed structure - a freeway, bridge, skyscraper or sculpture. The camera has a combination prism-and-lens attachment developed by Paul Kenworthy during World War II to show tank drivers what the landscape looks like from inside a tank. The mechanism became the basis of the snorkel camera, which Mr. Kenworthy invented for the movie industry, so that audiences could glide down the streets of a miniature city as if they were pedestrians touring a life-size metropolis, or stand nearby as larger-than-life monsters battled for control of the planet. A prism lets the camera turn, twist and pivot to mimic the turning of a person's head.",1983-12-11T05:00:00+0000

The Assistant Attorney General, who perhaps had greater impact on antitrust policy and enforcement than anyone since F.D.R.'s antitrust chief, Thurmon Arnold, plans to return to Stanford Law School to teach. During his tenure, Mr. Baxter ended the Government's two largest antitrust cases - the A.T.& T. monopoly case, which resulted in the coming Jan. 1 breakup, and the I.B.M. monopoly case, which Mr. Baxter dropped. Moreover, just last week he closed the Government's six-year antitrust investigation of the four major American oil companies that are partners in Saudi Arabia's Aramco. Mr. Baxter's successor will be J. Paul McGrath, head of the Justice Department's civil division, but Mr. McGrath has disqualified himself from involvement in the A.T.& T. case since he has worked for the company. Interestingly, that leaves no Reagan appointee heading the Administration's involvement in the largest corporate breakup in history. Staying On. Lee A.

It was an exuberant little ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, with the students waving small flags and the Marine band playing marches, and President Reagan was clearly delighted. ''What you saw 10 days ago was called patriotism,'' he remarked. What in the world, I wondered, did he mean by that? Did he mean that he himself had acted patriotically by ordering the invasion, because he saw the country endangered by Cuban activities on the island? Did he mean that those who criticized the invasion, saw it as an overreaction or a violation of international law or a cynical piece of pre-election melodrama, were by definition unpatriotic? Did he mean that any red-blooded American ought to feel proud of this demonstration of American might and resolution, and of the speed with which American troops did the job assigned to them? Why was it ''patriotism'' and not a distasteful job, well enough done? Why was he gloating so much?",1983-12-11T05:00:00+0000

Joseph Wood Krutch thought its core of shrewd observation was ''enveloped in a fuzzy haze of pretentious, sentimental, pseudo-poetic verbiage.'' And Lewis Nichols of The New York Times, while conceding Williams's ''ear for painfully sardonic dialogue and affection for his characters,'' felt that the principal reason for the piece's success was Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield. In fact, it wasn't until Helen Hayes took the same part in 1956 that Brooks Atkinson rebalanced the record in these columns, talking of the depth and charity and ''perfect blend of humor and pathos'' of ''The Glass Menagerie.''",1983-12-11T05:00:00+0000

It is true that Syria and its motley Lebanese allies hold the better cards. It is also true that some kind of deal will have to be struck with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. It does not follow, however, that the United States should pick up the first available fig leaf and run. There is first of all a matter of principle that great powers can ignore only at their peril: You don't wave a big stick and then slink out after you have been slugged. To cut and run does not exactly boost a nation's reputation - and, alas, ''reputation'' is not just the figment of a macho imagination. In the affairs of nations, it is an important source of power, crucial for keeping friends and influencing opponents. After the Syrian attack last week on two American reconnaissance planes, the Lebanese contest changed profoundly. It is no longer Syrian surrogates who are shooting at Marines and dispatching kamikaze trucks. It is the Syrians, allied with the Soviet Union and Iran, who have thrown down the gauntlet, calculating that the American public has no stomach for fighting on behalf of ambiguous interests in faraway places. They may well be right, but, if so, no one should delude himself about the consequences of American disengagement. Not only the Syrians but everyone else in the Middle East would gather that the United States is not willing to back up its interests with force.",1983-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Tennstedt responded by leading a high-tension performance of ''Fidelio'' that often stretched the dramatic line near the breaking point, particularly in a passionate reading of the ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3, gratuitously played as usual before the final scene.",1983-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Experts in and out of the Administration said the current outlook for inflation is much better than they had foreseen. (Page 1.) Industry ran at 79.2 percent of capacity in November, the highest level in more than two years, the Federal Reserve Board reported. It noted, however, that recent gains were more moderate than those of last spring and summer, a slowing welcomed by economists as a safeguard against any flareup of inflation.

Yet his performances, more often than not, had such power, such an inexorable sense of sweep, that Furtw""angler was likened to a pure fool, divinely inspired.

''Noises Off'' is a play about theater professionals who somehow make the show go on even when the show is terrible and the scenery is all but falling down. Mr. Frayn didn't write his farce as a parable about the New York theater, 1983, but it could most hearteningly serve as one.

In the first half of this year, the Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registered 628 people who crossed the border from Soviet bloc countries and Albania seeking asylum, and 365 of them were Rumanians. Recently, according to officials here, the Government of President Nicolae Ceausescu has intensified efforts to apprehend Rumanian escapers, most of whom are young unskilled workers. Rumanian border patrols have recently crossed into Yugoslav territory in pursuit of them, bringing protests from Belgrade that have not until now been publicized. In general, Rumania and Yugoslavia have had good official relations since 1964, but the issue of violations was brought up by President Mika Spiljak during the Yugoslav's meeting with President Ceausescu in Bucharest in November, according to Belgrade officials. The Government in Belgrade has made a policy of not publicizing the number of escapes or the routes used, but the figures are made public in annual United Nations refugee reports. Until now Yugoslavia has provided permanent asylum to only a handful of the escapers, according to United Nations officials, and houses the great majority in two transit camps or Belgrade hotels until they can be moved to other countries.",1983-12-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Testing Means, and Meanness","What's the Reagan approach to hunger? The Administration displayed it last week in both theory and practice. The President himself articulated the theory, in defending his cuts in social service programs. ''It wasn't that we were feeding too many of the needy,'' he said. ''We were taking care of too many of the non-needy.'' That puts the matter plainly. When given a choice between feeding the hungry and catching cheaters, his Administration would rather catch cheaters. The Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, was putting the theory into practice. It promulgated new regulations concerning surplus food. States must now impose ''income-based standards'' to insure that only truly needy people get free food, in bulk or at soup kitchens. In other words, it's no longer enough for poor people to wait in the cold for five hours to get a $7 slab of surplus cheese. It's no longer enough to wait three hours for a soup-kitchen lunch. Now when they get to the head of the line, they're to be subjected to some sort of means test. They'll have to certify somehow that they are poor. Think about that for a minute. There's nothing outrageous about the idea of means-testing. It makes eminent sense in a program like food stamps, intended only for people under the poverty level. But that's vastly different from the ragged, right- now hunger at soup kitchens. True, some states have distributed surplus food to the elderly, poor or not, producing grotesque anecdotes.",1983-12-25T05:00:00+0000

The final approval came only after the two big companies agreed to a consent decree that limits production to 200,000 subcompacts a year. Even so, the the five-man commission was split, with the three Reagan appointees pitted against the two appointed during the Carter Administration. ''A plain and unambiguous violation of the antitrust laws,'' said Michael Pertschuk, who was chairman of the F.T.C. under President Carter and voted against the Toyota-G.M. deal.

us,The Chicanery of 'Silkwood',"''Silkwood'' is a delightful movie with fine performances by Meryl Streep, Kurt Russell and Cher. Like other docudramas, it is also a perversion of the reporter's craft, which it simulates. As a genre, it deserves vigorous protest. Karen Silkwood worked as a technician in the Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent, Okla., where plutonium was fashioned into fuel rods for a breeder reactor. An active union member, she protested the safety conditions at the plant, and was herself contaminated with plutonium, but in ways that suggest it was possibly by her own hand. She gathered evidence that the quality control photographs of the fuel rods were being touched up - which they were, but to conceal dust spots, not defects. She died in a car accident, on Nov. 13, 1974, en route to meet a New York Times reporter, David Burnham. The case became an important strand in the national debate about nuclear power, with Miss Silkwood's adherents contending that she was murdered, their opponents that she fell asleep at the wheel while on tranquilizers. By using real names, the film purports to be a documentary account. But it makes only gestures toward presenting all facets of the case, and leaves the overwhelming impression that Karen Silkwood was murdered. The truck headlights blazing through the rear window on her final journey afford the clearest possible hint that she was forced off the road. A written epilogue that the police ruled her death a single-car accident makes only a fractional counterbalance, and tends, if anything, to corroborate the film's implied authenticity.",1983-12-25T05:00:00+0000

When it began it was easy to feel that traditional, ''straight'' photography had been pushed out of the limelight, which had been grabbed by the self-consciously fabricated tableaux and stolen imagery of an artistic avant-garde wearing SoHo-designed clothes with a Post-Modernist label sewn on. While undeniably high on energy, the young artists of this persuasion seemed to lack any regard for photographic tradition; in some eyes the medium was in danger of being totally consumed by the capacious maw of the art world. As if to confirm this notion, the boom in collecting photographs seemingly had gone bust, taking with it a number of photography galleries.",1983-12-25T05:00:00+0000

The commission assigned direct blame for the inadequate security at the compound and the concentration of troops in one building to two Marine commanders in Beirut. The panel criticized the upper chain of command for failing to provide effective supervision. (Page A1, Col. 6.) Terrorism was likened to war by the Pentagon commission that investigated the truck bombing of the Marine compound in Beirut. Its report said the Marine unit ''was not trained, organized, staffed or supported to deal effectively with the terrorist threat in Lebanon.''
