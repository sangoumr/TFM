October 10 was the anniversary of an uprising in 1911 that led to the creation of the Republic of China, and it was celebrated in Taiwan by a massive military parade through the streets of the capital, Taipei. By great good luck, my fathers office overlooked the vast square in front of the Presidential Palace that was the marchers final destination. From his office window, I would watch transfixed as the square below gradually filled with soldiers wearing a riotous array of uniforms and standing at rigid attention. The highlight was when Chiang Kai-shek emerged onto a balcony of the palace to give a speech. It always ended with the same exhortation: Back to the Mainland! At this, artillery would thunder, a hundred thousand soldiers cheered as one, and great billows of propaganda balloons and homing pigeons carrying anti-communist messages rose into the sky, theoretically on their way to the enemy, Red China, just eighty miles away across the Formosa Strait.

Up to that point, serving in the military seemed like more than sufficient civic engagement and provided a ready excuse for voluntarily opting out of several elections. By the time Barack Obama won the Democratic primary, I was an officer whod spent more than a decade in the Navy and not a second in a voting booth. This apathy does not run in the blood. My parents are products of the civil rights era and the Jim Crow South, and as such religiously exercised their hard-won right to vote. In my formative years, the basic disposition of the house politics pressed together progressive demands for racial equality with the Black conservatism of marathon church services that stretched deep into Southern Sunday afternoons. We differed in degree on any number of issues, but elections were where our politics really diverged. Like much of Black America, my mother is a lifelong Democrat, staying true even as the party vacillated in and out of her good graces. My father is a somewhat perfunctory Republican, an heirloom affiliation inherited from Black Americans early-20th-century preference for the party of Lincoln and consecrated in the familial name carried by my grandfather, father and me: Theodore Roosevelt Johnson.",2020-09-16T09:00:23+0000

That 1933 image of Dietrich, dressed in a tailored suit with one leg hoisted atop the running board of a Rolls-Royce, inspired him to create his now iconic Le Smoking tuxedo, which debuted in the designers 1966 haute couture collection. Once reserved for the cigar rooms of English gentlemens clubs, Saint Laurents black grain de poudre blazer with silk satin lapels, worn with a cummerbund, ruffled jabot blouse and bow tie over side-striped slacks, shocked the sartorial world: It was the first time a womens designer had presented trousers for evening wear. But it quickly became the uniform of liberated women: The model Bianca Jagger wore a white version when she married Mick in 1971. The singer Franoise Hardy arrived at the opera in Paris dressed in a Smoking (and was heckled). And when the socialite Nan Kempner was famously turned away from the Manhattan restaurant La Cte Basque while wearing the tux (their dress code prohibited women from wearing pants), she slipped off her trousers and turned the blazer into a minidress.

This was no small part of the holiness of the baths, for me, the way they brought together strangers, past and present: the tattooed hipster with a handlebar mustache who dunked his head under the icy water of the cold plunge with performative nonchalance; the impossibly thin old woman who looked like a once-ballerina or a once-junkie, her skin steaming in the darkness; and the swarthy Russian man with salt-and-pepper hair who moaned under the sway and crack of oak branches slapped across his back.",2020-09-22T09:00:19+0000

A major factor in those decisions, according to some physicians, was the uncertain implications of a July paper in JAMA Cardiology. In this study of 100 people who had Covid-19, M.R.I.s showed at least some signs of myocarditis in 60 of them, meaning they had inflammation in the heart muscle, which can weaken the organ and, on rare occasions, lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Another study, published this month in the same journal, looked at 26 Ohio State athletes who experienced Covid-19 with mild or no symptoms and detected evidence of possible myocarditis in five of them and lesser abnormalities in nine more. The condition poses a heightened risk to those whose physical activity puts stress on the heart: Even before the pandemic, myocarditis was a leading cause of death in young, otherwise healthy athletes.",2020-09-23T09:00:08+0000

Raised in Milan and the village of Caravaggio in a family that some say was on the cusp of minor nobility, Caravaggio was 6 when he lost both his father and grandfather, on the same day, to the plague. He was apprenticed around age 13 to Simone Peterzano, a painter in the region, from whom he must have learned the basics: preparing canvases, mixing paint, perspective, proportion. He apparently developed a facility for still-life painting, and it was probably while studying with Peterzano that he absorbed the pensive atmosphere of Leonardo da Vinci and great Northern Italian painters of the 16th century like Giorgione and Titian.",2020-09-23T09:00:42+0000

us,Design for the Future When the Future Is Bleak,"AT ITS CORE, design is an inherently futurist medium. In the 1960s, as the writer Maggie Gram has noted, key figures in the Modern design movement often used the word design indistinguishably from the word planning. This isnt surprising: Design, like planning, was the profession most concerned with the future. Today is not so different, but what we mean by the future, a utopian ideal throughout much of the 20th century, is now undeniably much darker as we progress further into the 21st. To look ahead at what role design will play on an increasingly troubled planet takes us back to the fundamental polysemy behind the word itself. At various times it has encompassed drawing and architecture, products and graphics  in fact, everything short of the creation of the world itself (and, in the risible concept of intelligent design, sometimes that, too). Once industrial design became a profession in the early 20th century, the promiscuity of its aims and undefined nature of its objectives meant that designers felt they could do very nearly anything. In its most heroic phase, the mid-20th century, industrial designers gave themselves over to pronouncements that suggested they alone held the key to this savage parade. What are the boundaries of design? was the question posed in 1969 to Charles Eames, who, with his partner, Ray, designed chairs, toys, housing, films, exhibitions and, to a certain extent, the very nature of communication. Eames responded, What are the boundaries of problems?",2020-09-28T13:00:12+0000

In the aughts, when his focus was apparel (he ran Edun, the clothing company started by Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson), he created loose silhouettes from linen and cotton dyed with coffee, blue corn and gardenia blossoms. In recent years, he has concentrated on furniture, lighting and sculpture, all with his signature futuristic, biomorphic contours, using bronze, gypsum, wood and plaster. This massive fireplace surround may be the ultimate expression of his aesthetic: Just over eight feet tall and nearly as wide, it is sculpted from a heat-tolerant marble composite that has a velvety matte finish  the stone is ground to a powder and combined with resin and ceramic fiber insulation.

Because of pandemic restrictions, it wont be exactly as planned. The restaurant, in the as-yet unopened Dominick Hotel, will have 40 seats under heat lamps in the outdoor plaza to one side of the hotel. (Mr. Hergatt said outdoor seating was originally planned for next year but expedited.) The interior dining room, with lofty ceilings and modern dcor blending industrial materials, will seat just 30. I cut my team by half due to the restrictions, down to 17 from 30, Mr. Hergatt said. Fortunately, my menu was always going to be quite simple. It emphasizes vegetables and seafood and, in its present form, is fairly concise. Some snacks, like shiso tempura with shrimp, and nori chips with salmon, are to be followed by warm and cold small plates, including scallops with avocado and yuzu, sushi rice with fish and cured egg yolk, and chicken dumplings in pork broth.
