Deitrick, Sr., who served as Dean of Cornell University Medical College from 1957-1969. During his long and distinguished career, Dr. Deitrick was one of the leading figures in American medical education. He joined The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1934 as a resident in medicine and subsequently became a member of the Medical College faculty in the Department of Medicine. In 1949, he took a leave of absence from the Medical Center to direct a comprehensive survey of medical education for the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association, which published his landmark report: ''Medical Schools in the United States at the Mid-Century.'' In 1957, Dr. Deitrick returned to New York-Cornell to become Dean of the Medical College. Among his many accomplishments was a significant increase in the ration of faculty to students, with the number of faculty increasing by 43% during his deanship. From 1962 to 1969, he served as a Trustee of Cornell University, representing the faculty of the Medical College. In 1969, when he retired from the Deanship, he became Professor Emeritus of Medicine. In 1982, Dr. Deitrick received New York-Cornell's highest honor, the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award, in recognition of his exceptional and longstanding service.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; After the Last Picture Show,"The boarded-up movie theaters in Michael Putnam's SILENT SCREENS: The Decline and Transformation of the American Movie Theater (Johns Hopkins University, $39.95) wear their faded glamour like battered hats. Putnam's photographs, taken with an 8 by 10 view camera, are starkly formalistic: the boxy, Art Deco theaters are largely shot head-on and centrally placed in the frame, making the viewer conscious of minute variations in detail and texture. The stylized neon marquees that read ''Ritz,'' ''Lux'' or ''Judy'' contrast with the blank, peeling facades, as if we can see the dream palace that once was and the shell it has become. In the two decades since he started the project, Putnam found the old theaters were disappearing like buffalo from the plains. The film historian Robert Sklar points out in his introduction that although local cinemas figure prominently in our national mythos, they actually were a secondary source of revenue for Hollywood. In a 1948 antitrust case, the Supreme Court ruled that the studios held a monopoly because of their control over the vastly more influential metropolitan first-run theaters, which constituted less than 1 percent of the 10,000 screens in the country. Larry McMurtry, who wrote the novel ''The Last Picture Show,'' says that the old theaters are ''structural Quixotes, exhausted and brought to rest by brute reality, yet retaining in the gaunt and stubborn angles of their facades a suggestions of the visions, cheap but romantic, that once rolled like great clouds across their screens.''

us,QUICK BITE/Carteret; These Eyes Spy Cheese Fries,"Wisconsin is synonymous with cheese, and for potatoes, you've got to go with Idaho. But when it comes to combining the two, New Jersey takes the cake. (I do not know which state takes the cake for cake.) I'm talking, of course, about cheese fries. You were thinking maybe potatoes au gratin? Sorry, mon ami; this is the New Jersey section, not Le Figaro. Driving along Roosevelt Avenue in Carteret, I believed I had stumbled across the Cheese Fry Holy Grail. Could it be -- a restaurant named Cheese Fries? With a 24-hour drive-through window? That's what it said on the bright yellow sign just off the road. But it was not to be. The establishment was, in fact, Burger Express. Had I approached from the other direction, I would have thought its name was Fried Chicken. Entering Burger Express was like stepping back in time, into my beloved world of 1970's fast food: dark wood paneling, rounded corners on rectangular windows. The ambience harked back to a simpler, pre-McNugget era, before environmental activists sprung the Quarter Pounder from its plastic foam cage. Alas, I was derailed from my retro reverie by an unmistakable train theme, with faded railroad photos on the wall, and a burger named The Locomotive ($3.84). I ordered a Big Broiler with cheese ($2.34), and admired some atypical fast-food menu items, such as grilled cheese with tuna ($3.04) and grits ($1.74). But let's face it, I was there for the cheese fries ($2.55). They came in a generous portion of crisp, hot crinkle-cuts, smothered in a hearty but not overpowering cheese sauce. Served in a plastic foam container, no less. To the young entrepreneurs out there: The restaurant name Cheese Fries is apparently still available. I am easily reached for consulting.

us,When Women Step Into the Ring,"IT was largely the romantic obsession of male writers and moviemakers that first elevated boxing from barroom backwater to relative respectability early in the 20th century. From Damon Runyon's columns in The New York American, Hemingway's ruminations on the ''sweet science'' and Clifford Odets's play ''Golden Boy,'' to Norman Mailer's discourse on the Thrilla in Manilla, and Martin Scorsese's ''Raging Bull,'' boxing has long stood as a metaphor for male angst and aggression. The lawlessness of the boxing establishment -- still evident today -- invited riffs on exploitation and the corruptibility of the soul.",2000-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Shearing the Flock,"Wendell Berry's new novel, JAYBER CROW (Counterpoint, $25), is an observant and agreeably rough-hewn book that relates the life story of a young man who abandons his plans to become a minister and becomes the town barber instead. Like so much of Berry's fiction -- he has also written many volumes of poetry and acerbic social commentary -- Jayber Crow'' is set in the fictional small town of Port William, Ky. We suffer with Jayber as he watches the object of his affections, a young woman named Mattie, marry her high school sweetheart, Troy Chatham. Troy exploits her father's land and betrays her. Mattie's marriage to Troy becomes a metaphor for the dying prosperity of small southern towns like Port William, and for the withering of family ties. But as Jayber, a bachelor who is losing his hair, narrates his own tale of unrequited love, he reflects upon the stories he hears as he's giving a shave or a haircut -- and he is somehow buoyed. ''The world doesn't stop because you are in love or in mourning or in need of time to think,'' he says. ''And so when I have thought I was in my story or in charge of it, I really have been only on the edge of it, carried along.'' The novel's digressive structure makes for a slow start, but by the end this melancholy barber has won both our attention and our hearts. Gail Gilliland",2000-10-01T05:00:00+0000

He was 70. He was predeceased by his first wife Olga and is survived by his second wife Sachiko; his three sons, Robert, Hidalgo, and Richard; a brother, Yasuo of Tokyo, Japan; and his grandchildren Arthur and Carson. Dr. Nagashima, a pioneering anesthesiologist, helped to develop the careers of countless young Japanese anesthesiologists. He acted as mentor and ''father'' to many young anesthesiologists coming from Japan who had spent one or more fellowship years at Montefiore. Dr. Nagashima was born in Yokosuka City, Japan, on September 9, 1930. He completed his medical degree at Yokohama University School of Medicine in 1957, and that year came to New York, where he began an internship at Fordham Hospital. After completing his internship in 1958, he began his residency training and fellowship at Montefiore Hospital in anesthesiology, beginning a 42-year career there. In 1962, he joined the Montefiore Hospital attending staff and was appointed as an Instructor in Anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1964. In 1979, Dr. Nagashima achieved the rank of Professor, and was elected membership in the prestigious Association of University Anesthesiologists. He has had a distinguished and fruitful career at Montefiore Hospital. He has been loved and admired by his colleagues, friends, and especially his family. We are deeply saddened, and he will truly be missed. He was a true gentleman in every sense of the word.

us,Taking the Guesswork Out of 'Cook Until Done',"There are a number of ways to determine whether fish has reached the proper degree of doneness. Cooking it 10 minutes for every inch of thickness is an old standby, as is prodding it to see if it flakes. But both methods often guarantee overcooking. Now there's Captain Quackenbush's Fish Cooking Testers, plastic-coated sensors that are briefly inserted in the fish and turn green when it reaches 140 to 145 degrees, the temperature the Agriculture Department considers safe. The testers are not for cooks who like their tuna rare or their salmon somewhat underdone: both will be thoroughly cooked if you wait for the green. But the testers are fine for cod and striped bass. You can also use them to test chicken breast or pork chops (cut a little slit so the tester slips in), or to signal a medium hamburger. A package of six is $1.99 at Citarella stores.",2000-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Arafat Places Conditions on Mideast Talks in Paris," PARIS -- The focus of Middle East peacemaking efforts shifted Wednesday to Paris, but Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat demanded two things before he would agree to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak: a guarantee of protection for his people and an inquiry into the causes of violence that have swept the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Arafat told reporters after meeting with French President Jacques Chirac that a three-way meeting that had been planned with he, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Barak, was not a sure thing. ""The meeting (with Barak) will depend on the one I will have with Albright,"" said Arafat. Asked what his conditions were, he said, ""Protection and an international inquiry commission."" A senior Palestinian official has said an international inquiry into Israel's actions would be a condition of reviving the peace talks. But Barak's office has said he ""totally rejected the call for an international investigation."" ""I think that, if there are questions and if there are queries, we can answer them ourselves. We don't need a committee biased against Israel to investigate things,"" Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told Israel radio Wednesday. Albright arrived at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Paris on Wednesday to start the talks aimed at stopping six days of violence that have left at least 58 people dead in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, and salvage the already-stalled Middle East peace process. She met with both Barak and Arafat Wednesday separately. At about the same time, Chirac met with Barak, who was accompanied by his most senior military adviser, Danny Yatom. Fighting broke out last week after an Israeli hardline leader, Ariel Sharon, visited one of Jerusalem's most hotly contested holy sites, a spot revered by both Jews and Muslims. State Department spokesman Philip Reeker, speaking in Washington, said CIA director George Tenet planned to join Albright in Paris. Reeker said Tenet will take part in discussions on security issues. As diplomatic efforts gained momentum, there were no signs of the violence abating. Two Palestinians were shot dead early Wednesday in the West Bank, and three Israeli military outposts in the Gaza Strip came under attack overnight. In northern Israel, a large forest fire raged Wednesday, one of more than 100 blazes that police believe have been set by Arab arsonists. Most have been extinguished. Europe has pointed the finger of blame at Sharon, who visited a shrine, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Al Haram As-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. The dispute over who will control the site is the main obstacle to a peace agreement. Chirac has blamed the violence on an ""irresponsible provocation"" -- a clear reference to Sharon's visit to the holy site. Sharon, notorious among Palestinians for launching the bloody war against Arafat's forces in Lebanon in 1982, said he bore no responsibility. After the Paris talks, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key player in the Middle East peace process, is planning a leadership summit on Thursday. Barak and Arafat have both agreed to come, Mubarak said Tuesday. Officials said the Paris talks would not just be a bid to stem the tide of violence. ""The meeting ... is a step in the direction of the renewal of the negotiations and not just the end of violence here,"" Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told Israel radio. A diplomatic drive, led by Clinton, to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement had lost momentum even before the recent violence, stalling after a July summit in Camp David.

us,Philip Glass and Friends Wrap Everything Into a Symphony,"Since the early 19th century symphonists have tried to wrap music around transcendent ideas, from the concepts of heroism or universal brotherhood (in the Beethoven Third and Ninth Symphonies, respectively) to the mystical aspects of fate, death and resurrection, or heaven and the afterlife (in much of Mahler). Implicit in these works is a notion that is as old as the Psalms and that runs through medieval and Renaissance motets and Bach Masses: that music has a direct, emotional power that can magnify any idea, however mundane or profound.",2000-10-04T05:00:00+0000

Grandfather of Christina, Patrick, Alexander, Daniel and Paul. Father-in-law of Madge, Ellen, Harry and Henri. He will be remembered by family and friends for his love of life and friendship, for his sense of humor, his wisdom, and his courage, as well as his contribution to the French Resistance. BAUDOIN-Charles H. It is with a profound sense of loss that Thanks To Scandinavia notes the passing of a truly exceptional and honorable human being Charles H. Baudoin. A person of unyielding faith in the goodness of mankind, he devoted much of his adult life to humane causes that enriched the lives of thousands. As a Vice President and a member of the Thanks to Scandinavia Board of Directors, he was a motivating source instrumental in the educational organization's recent affiliation with the American Jewish Committee. He was dedicated to the moral imperatives of Thanks To Scandinavia in reminding current and future generations of the heroism and bravery of the people, the governments and churches of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in rescuing persons of the Jewish faith from the Holocaust and in expressing America's gratitude to the Scandinavians through its perpetual program of scholarship awards to Scandinavian students and doctors. The nobility and sense of humane purpose exhibited by Charles Baudoin throughout his long and fruitful life stands as a beacon to all who mourn his passing today. Victor Borge, National Chairman Richard Netter, President Michael D. Beinner, Vice President BAUDOIN-Charles H. The American Jewish Committee is deeply saddened by the death of Charles H. Baudoin, a vice president of, and vital force behind, Thanks To Scandinavia, an organization with which AJC is proud to have joined in affiliation. Having survived the Holocaust as part of the French Resistance, Mr. Baudoin's affection for, and dedication to, this group that honors the unique role of Scandinavian countries in the rescue of Jews during World War II was a natural outgrowth of who he was and what he stood for. He was a brave and gentle man, and an inspiration and a friend. We send our sincere condolences to his wife and chidren. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading economic newspaper in Japan, published what it called a draft of the balance sheet, which showed that Japan's liabilities, including pension obligations for the nation's aging population, are more than double its total assets of 660 trillion yen, or about $6.1 trillion.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  HONSINGER, LEROY VERNON","HONSINGER-Leroy Vernon, Rear Admiral, died at the Masonic Geriatric Healthcare Center in Wallingford on Sunday, October 1, 2000 after a short illness. Recently turned 95, he had lived at 4303 Ashlar Village for the last eight and one-half years. He also had lived in Southbury, CT for eighteen years. Admiral Honsinger was born September 5, 1905, the second of five children of Dr. Frederick S. and Evalina Vernon Honsinger. Named for his maternal grandfather, he was widely known by the nickname given by his father-Mike. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1927 and received the Master of Science degree in naval architecture from MIT in 1932. As a young naval officer he served a tour of duty in Panama and, in his long life, he transited the Panama Canal fifty-four times. During World War II Honsinger was deeply involved in battleship and LST (Landing Ship Tank) construction in the Norfolk, VA Navy Yard, in repairing British warships damaged in the Battle of the Atlantic, and in aircraft carrier construction at Newport News Shipbuilding Company in VA. Sent to Europe the last year of the war, he served as Acting Chief of the United States Technical Mission responsible for investigating German shipyards and their shipbuilding programs and bringing back their secrets. Admiral Honsinger served several tours of duty in the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C., including detailed responsibility for the Navy's shipbuilding program during the Korean War. After a tour as Commanding Officer of the Navy shipyard at Long Beach, CA, he was promoted to rear admiral and sent back to the Bureau of Ships for four years, first as Division Head of Ship Design, Construction, and Repair, and then for two years as Deputy Chief. Honsinger was associated early, and for many years, with the nuclear submarine program. He completed his thirty-nine-year naval career as Commanding Officer of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, whose mission at that period was building nuclear submarines. Honsinger retired from Mare Island in 1962 with the Legion of Merit. Honsinger was president of the American Society of Naval Engineers and also of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. After retirement Admiral Honsinger spent ten years with Todd Shipyards Corporation in New York City, eight of those years as Vice President for Shipbuilding. In his later years he was a Trustee and Vice Chairman of World Education, an organization set up to support the literacy work of his aunt, Dr. Welthy Honsinger Fisher. Always civic minded, Admiral Honsinger was active in church work wherever he lived and for many years was an active Rotarian, including one year as President of the Tribury Rotary Club in Southbury, CT. He developed great interest in environmental issues and in his eighties made himself an expert on recycling efforts. Admiral Honsinger married his childhood sweetheart Norma Chapin in 1930 and the couple had just celebrated their seventieth wedding anniversary, September 6, 2000. In addition to hie wife, he is survived by a son, retired Captain Vernon Chapin (Chip) Honsinger of Lexington, VA, a daughter, Valerie Kirkpatrick Joiner of Atlanta, GA, a sister, Helen Halstead of Peru, VT, five grandchildren and six great grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Thursday, October 12, 2000 at the Activities Room at Ashlar Village, Cheshire Road, Wallingford. Burial will be private at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. There are no calling hours. It is suggested that gifts in his memory be made to the Ashlar Village Grants and Aid Fund, Post Office Box 70, Wallingford, CT 06492. Please call the B.C.

Lewis and Sandra Blakeslee, and ''The Case for Marriage,'' by Linda J. Waite and Maggie Gallagher -- have renewed the debate over the once-scandalous, now commonplace phenomenon of divorce. The first study suggests that children of divorce suffer more than we suspect, and the second suggests that the long-term benefits of staying together are greater than we realize. To those who choose to end their marriages, of course, sociological analyses are irrelevant; it is always a personal decision, and usually a painful one. Most who make that choice do so just a few years after marriage. But the seven people featured on these pages spent decades together before parting ways. One couple fell victim to infidelity, another came apart when one spouse realized he wasn't who he thought he was, a third simply drifted apart. Yet another -- overshadowed by the demands of work -- later managed to reconcile. Here, they talk frankly about why they made such a radical change after so many years together.",2000-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Quadrennial Madness,"Evan Cornog and Richard Whalen's HATS IN THE RING: An Illustrated History of American Presidential Campaigns (Random House, $39.95) fills in the gaps of dimly remembered high school history classes. If you cannot recall what the Federalists stood for, or who Tippecanoe was, or when Wendell Willkie ran for president, then it will serve as an entertaining primer. Short chapters on each election convey basic historical information: who ran, who won, what issues mattered and how the campaigns were conducted. The text is illustrated by numerous prints, political cartoons and photographs, and peppered with primary sources and anecdotes. We learn, for example, that ''Franklin Pierce commissioned Nathaniel Hawthorne, his former classmate at Bowdoin College, to write a campaign biography. When Horace Mann heard about the project, he quipped that if Hawthorne succeeded in writing an inspiring biography of the undistinguished Pierce, it would be 'the greatest work of fiction he ever wrote.' ''Cornog, the author of ''The Birth of Empire: DeWitt Clinton and the American Experience, 1769-1828'' and an associate dean at Columbia University's School of Journalism, and Whalen, the author of biographies of Robert Capa and Alfred Stieglitz, discuss the enormous influence of the founding fathers; not only did they create a constitutional system, but they also established such a moral standard that for close to a century, politicians refused to campaign extensively, lest they appear more power-hungry than Washington or Jefferson. Even in 1900, observers considered William Jennings Bryan's whistle-stop tour of the country ''begging for the presidency as a tramp might beg for a pie.'' The authors even celebrate the gradual acceptance of campaigning and the decline of the stigma of self-interest, arguing that it creates at least the possibility of open contests and informed electorates.

The fishnets aren't meant to be trashy, a la Madonna in her ''Lucky Star'' video, but more as a kicky touch to the preppy woolens also in vogue. Christina Perrin showed fishnets with hot pants and miniskirts in her fall collection as well as a wide-windowpaned version with a ladylike suit. ''I find fishnets incredibly sexy, especially if they have a shimmer and great texture,'' she said. To incorporate the fishnet look into everyday fashion, and take the streetwalker out of it, Ms. Perrin suggests wearing red fishnets, for example, ''with boots, paired with something caramel.''",2000-10-08T05:00:00+0000

It was leather, the kids could jump on it, but it didn't travel well with time. I've learned since then that the idea of having everything monochromatically ''designed'' makes a strong statement but forgets the humanity of the space. And yet, even then, when environments were hard-edged and modularly oriented, there was the commencement of an understanding of bringing in different periods. The crudeness of that wood table next to the smoothness of the leather yields a yin-yang quality. With today's perspective, I look at the coffee table and I see a very Zen type of surface.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Little Gloria, Free at Last","In his sprawling new novel, GLORIA (Soho, $27), which takes place among the country club set in West Virginia in the late 1950's, Keith Maillard gets the details right. The book, which owes a small debt to John O'Hara's fiction, is meticulous in its resurrection of period detail -- the fashions, the slang and the social and sexual mores of debutantes, cocktail-drinking executives and drum majorettes. The novel is set largely during the summer of 1957, a momentous one for Gloria Cotter. She is back home in Raysburg, W.Va. after graduating from college, and she has three months to make a big decision: Will she marry Rolland Spicer, her devoted and socially unimpeachable college sweetheart, as her family and almost everyone else expects? Or will she head instead for New York City, where an unknown world, as well as a graduate program in Renaissance poetry, await her at Columbia University? There are many stumbling blocks on the journey Gloria has to make that summer: the rigid conformism of Eisenhower society, her sorority sisters and her controlling parents; the unwanted advances of her father's brutish right-hand man; her distrust of her own sexuality; and, above all, her all-consuming need to fit in, which is at war with her streak of intellectual rebellion. ''Gloria'' is occasionally weighed down by its heroine's tendentious equation of literary criticism with religious salvation, and perhaps by one or two more references than are strictly necessary to the various contours and responses of her athletic body. But Maillard nevertheless succeeds in building a gilded, crinoline-draped labyrinth and watching his lithe, artful protagonist wiggle and reason her way to freedom.

SmithKline Beecham has made a cash tender offer for all outstanding Block common stock at $53 per share, the drug group said in a statement. Block Drug, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, manufactures Sensodyne toothpaste, Poli-Grip denture adhesive and other consumer health care products. The firm reported sales of $864.3 million in the year to March 31, 2000. SmithKline said it had received commitments from a majority of Block shareholders to tender into the offer. ""This acquisition will significantly enhance SB's Consumer Health Care business, which is a key part of out strategy for corporate growth,"" said SmithKline Beecham CEO J.P. Garnier. SmithKline Beecham sold $4.1 billion worth of consumer health care products in 1999, a third of its total sales. The deal places SmithKline, which already produces the Aquafresh brand, among the world's top three toothpaste manufacturers. The company said it was too early to say what effect the takeover would have on jobs at Block Drug, which employs 3,000 people ""In any merger or takeover, jobs are lost,"" said SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman Lynne Smith. ""We will have a process that ensures we keep the best people ... There will be an effect in both companies."" The deal, which must gain regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, is not expected to affect SmithKline Beecham's proposed merger with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the statement said. That merger, which also is awaiting U.S. and British regulatory approval, is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. ",2000-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MULLANE, ED","MULLANE-Ed, who continued as owner and operator of Mullane Ford and as President of the Ford Dealers' Alliance until his last days, died on October 7, 2000, at his home in Paramus, NJ. He died of pulmonary complications, the residual effects of polio, which had kept him hospitalized for a year as a youth over seventy years ago. The Captain of the Hackensack High School football team, Ed subsequently graduated from Fordham University in 1935, and successfully ran his own business for over sixty years. Mullane Ford in Bergenfield, NJ, has always been noted for the highest quality customer service, and has thrived on repeat business. He was known as a maverick and highly principled advocate for the independent dealer, creating and leading the Ford Dealers' Alliance (FDA) in order to promote dealer and consumer interests in dealings with Ford Motor Company. Over the years Ed gave speeches in every state and was known for his fiery rhetoric in promoting the FDA. He also testified before legislative committees at both the federal and state levels, and his comments on industry issues have been broadcast by all the networks and published in the N.Y. Times and other major news media. Through his efforts major changes were achieved to bring more equity for dealers with regard to warranty reimbursement rates, fleet subsidies, parts prices and other issues. While he was often at odds with Ford policies, he developed friendships with several top Ford executives, including Lee Iaococa and Ben Bidwell. As Bidwell said in admiration, ''After Ed was made, they threw away the mold.'' In 1977 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Citation by the AOT, a leading automotive trade association. He was honored as one of the most influential people in the automotive industry over the last fifty years. Ed often used great quotations in his speeches, and this one from Edmund Burke best captures Ed's spirit: ''The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' This is how he lived his life; he believed one man could make a difference, and he succeeded in making that difference. Ed's wife Ruth passed away in 1996.

SmithKline Beecham has made a cash tender offer for all outstanding Block common stock at $53 per share, the drug group said in a statement. Block Drug, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, manufactures Sensodyne toothpaste, Poli-Grip denture adhesive and other consumer health care products. The firm reported sales of $864.3 million in the year to March 31, 2000. SmithKline said it had received commitments from a majority of Block shareholders to tender into the offer. ""This acquisition will significantly enhance SB's Consumer Health Care business, which is a key part of out strategy for corporate growth,"" said SmithKline Beecham CEO J.P. Garnier. SmithKline Beecham sold $4.1 billion worth of consumer health care products in 1999, a third of its total sales. The deal places SmithKline, which already produces the Aquafresh brand, among the world's top three toothpaste manufacturers. The company said it was too early to say what effect the takeover would have on jobs at Block Drug, which employs 3,000 people ""In any merger or takeover, jobs are lost,"" said SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman Lynne Smith. ""We will have a process that ensures we keep the best people ... There will be an effect in both companies."" The deal, which must gain regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, is not expected to affect SmithKline Beecham's proposed merger with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the statement said. That merger, which also is awaiting U.S. and British regulatory approval, is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. ",2000-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Mullane, President of Mullane Ford of Bergenfield, N.J. and President and Founder of the Ford Dealers Alliance died at his home on Saturday, October 7, 2000 of pulmonary complications, the residual effects of polio, a disease he contracted as a youth. Ed was a man of strong character and strong convictions. He lived his life by those convictions, always trying to make a difference in the world in which he lived. Upon graduating from Fordham University in 1935, Ed and his brother Bill ran Mullane Brothers Appliance business in New Jersey from 1935 to 1955, except for the time spent in the Army during WWII. He became a Ford dealer in 1956. In 1969, upon successfully challenging Ford on a warranty issue, he and the Newark and New York dealers realizing what could be accomplished as a group, founded and incorporated the Ford Dealers Alliance. Over the past 30 years, Ed became best known as an outspoken protagonist for dealers' rights. He had strongly and consistently espoused the rights of dealers and the consumer and unstintingly criticized the factory encroachment of those rights. His message has been carried in The New York Times, NBC National News and many other major news media, and has been mentioned in such books as Emma Rothschild's ''Paradise Lost'' and ''Iacocca's Autobiography'' in which he was the only dealer mentioned by name. In 1993, he was named one of the one-hundred most influential people in the history of the automobile industry by Automotive News, a trade publication. He believed in the words of Edmund Burke, who he often quoted, ''The only thing for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' This is the motto by which he lived his life. He was a good man who never tired of working towards ending factory injustices. With Ed's passing, we lose the staunchest supporter of dealer rights, a devoted leader, but most importantly, we lose a very good friend. We will all miss him terribly.

us,Celebrities Take Back Web Site Addresses From Squatters," GENEVA, Oct. 10 -- French actress Isabelle Adjani and Grammy Award winner Sade have won the right to their domain names after independent arbitrators ruled in their favour in cybersquatting cases, a United Nations agency said on Tuesday. The arbitrators, named by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), issued decisions ordering contested domain names transferred to the two female stars who argued they had established common law trademark rights to their names. A decision is expected later this month from the Geneva-based agency on a complaint filed by the American singer Madonna over the disputed domain name madonna.com. It was first registered by Dan Parisi, a New Jersey-based businessman known for having the on-line porn site whitehouse.com. Adjani, a Geneva resident whose films include La Reine Margot, Camille Claudel and L'Histoire D'Adele H, won the domain name isabelle-adjani.net from Second Orbit Communications Inc and Shi Young, of Mountain View California, the ruling said. The firm registered the name in April, but failed to respond to the arbitrator, who found it had no right or legitimate interest in the domain name being used it in bad faith. The Nigerian-born Helen Folsade Adu, who uses the stage name Sade, won the domain name sade.com from Quantum Computer Services Inc, based in Louisiana, in the United States. Sade, a singer, songwriter and recording arist since 1983, has recorded albums which have netted combined sales worldwide in excess of $37 million, according to her claim. Hits include ""Smooth Operator, ""No Ordinary Love"" and ""Cherish the Day."" Quantum offers Internet users ""personalised"" e-mail addresses via its sites where they can select and assign to themselves a ""novelty"" address. It had registered the domain name sade.com. using the alias ""The Sade Internet Fan Club."" The London-based singer claimed ownerhip of the unregistered trademark in which she claimed to have established significant common law rights in jurisdictions throughout the world through sales of records, tours, and appearances as a performing artist. The panel found that Quantum had intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its website or other on-line locations by creating a likelihood of confusion. It had used a false name purely for the purpose of trading on Sade's goodwill, of which it is neither owner nor licensee, for its own financial gain, according to the decision. WIPO, the U.N. agency that protects trademarks and copyrights, has received more than 1,300 cases of disputed domain names since starting its fast-track arbitration system last December. Decisions have been made in more than half of the alleged cybersquatting cases, with 80 percent of complainants winning transfer of the contested site. Trasnfers must be made within 45 days. A decision may be challenged within 10 days. ",2000-10-10T05:00:00+0000

The Challenger 604 made by Bombardier Inc. skidded across the runway Tuesday to the west edge of Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport, said Felix Lococo of the Federal Aviation Administration. The badly burned fuselage was mostly intact, but the plane lost its left engine and tail. Debris was scattered across a nearby road. The plane's third occupant was hospitalized in critical condition. ""There was the explosion. And then a couple of lights shook and it definitely felt like a sonic boom,"" said meteorologist Chance Hayes, who heard the crash from the National Weather Service office nearby. ""It made the building shake and we definitely knew something had happened."" The crash stalled rush-hour traffic in the western part of the city. Commercial flights were not interrupted, but part of the airport was closed. The plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were still in the aircraft for the National Transportation Safety Board to recover Wednesday. The plane, manufactured by Montreal-based Canadair, a unit of Bombardier Aerospace, had been in service since 1994 and logged 1,227 hours, company executives said. Bombardier Aerospace, one of the world's biggest airplane makers, manufactures its Learjet line in Wichita and uses its Wichita facilities as a flight test center. Tests scheduled Wednesday at the facility were suspended. The identities of the three crew members -- two pilots and a flight test engineer -- were not immediately released.

us,"America Online, Time Warner Merger Approved by European Union"," BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Union's executive body on Wednesday conditionally approved America Online Inc.'s $129 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., removing another obstacle in the proposed combination between the world's largest Internet and media companies. Under the terms of the approval, AOL and Time Warner agreed that they will not unfairly muscle out rivals from the emerging media and entertainment markets in Europe, the European Commission said. In a statement, the commission of the 15-nation European Union said that AOL is to sever its structural links with German media giant Bertelsmann AG. That condition is meant to allow Bertelsmann to remain an independent competitor in Europe. ""The commission has a duty to prevent creation of dominant positions in all sectors, be they in the old or new economy,"" said EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti. Antitrust officials were concerned about a resulting integrated company that ""could have dominated the online music distribution market and music players,"" Monti said. The AOL-Time Warner merger still has to be cleared by U.S. antitrust authorities, but the EU decision was seen as key for the chances of the merger going through. Sources said the EU antitrust authorities only formally endorsed the merger after the companies agreed to several concessions, including ending ties with Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media company. That move will prevent AOL ""from having access to Europe's leading source of music publishing rights, thereby eliminating the risk of dominance in the emerging markets for online delivery of music over the Internet and software-based music players,"" the commission statement said. The companies also have provided guarantees that they will not unfairly discriminate against other companies that provide Internet content or within the music industry. The vote of the 20-member commission on Wednesday came at its weekly meeting -- two weeks ahead of its deadline. EU authorities made quick progress on the issue after Time Warner last week dropped a separate joint venture plan with EMI Group of Britain, which would have created a major music company. European regulators had strongly opposed that deal. With Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, competing on its own, the commission said it concluded that AOL-Time Warner ""wouldn't have the critical mass in terms of music publishing to dominate the market."" Bertelsmann's BMG subsidiary is one of the world's five major music companies and EU antitrust officials feared the merger would have left the new company with the ability to keep the industry in a stranglehold. Bertelsmann is investing heavily to become the largest supplier of media content via the Internet. The antitrust division of the commission opened a probe into the proposed AOL-Time Warner merger in June, stressing the need for an open, competitive environment in the emerging cybermusic and entertainment markets.

That condition is meant to allow Bertelsmann to remain an independent competitor in Europe. ""The commission has a duty to prevent creation of dominant positions in all sectors, be they in the old or new economy,"" said EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti. Antitrust officials were concerned about a resulting integrated company that ""could have dominated the online music distribution market and music players,"" Monti said. The AOL-Time Warner merger still has to be cleared by U.S. antitrust authorities, but the EU decision was seen as key for the chances of the merger going through. Sources said the EU antitrust authorities only formally endorsed the merger after the companies agreed to several concessions, including ending ties with Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media company. That move will prevent AOL ""from having access to Europe's leading source of music publishing rights, thereby eliminating the risk of dominance in the emerging markets for online delivery of music over the Internet and software-based music players,"" the commission statement said. The companies also have provided guarantees that they will not unfairly discriminate against other companies that provide Internet content or within the music industry. The vote of the 20-member commission on Wednesday came at its weekly meeting -- two weeks ahead of its deadline. EU authorities made quick progress on the issue after Time Warner last week dropped a separate joint venture plan with EMI Group of Britain, which would have created a major music company. European regulators had strongly opposed that deal. With Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, competing on its own, the commission said it concluded that AOL-Time Warner ""wouldn't have the critical mass in terms of music publishing to dominate the market."" Bertelsmann's BMG subsidiary is one of the world's five major music companies and EU antitrust officials feared the merger would have left the new company with the ability to keep the industry in a stranglehold. Bertelsmann is investing heavily to become the largest supplier of media content via the Internet. The antitrust division of the commission opened a probe into the proposed AOL-Time Warner merger in June, stressing the need for an open, competitive environment in the emerging cybermusic and entertainment markets.

That makes it preferable in an uncooked tomato sauce although a concasse like the one we are preparing here can be cooked, too.

us,Swedish Computer Team Crack 10 of the Worlds Toughest Codes," LONDON, Oct. 12 -- A team of Swedish computer buffs have fought off thousands of rivals from around the world to crack what was billed as the toughest code challenge ever set. It took the Swedes the equivalent of 70 years of computer time to decipher 10 increasingly difficult codes set by author Simon Singh in his international bestseller ""The Code Book."" They ranged from ciphers dating back to ancient Greece through Victorian codes and the famed Nazi Enigma code machine from World War Two. ""It is the toughest code that has ever been cracked,"" Singh said on Thursday before handing over the first prize cheque for 10,000 pounds ($15,000) to the team headed by Fredrik Almgren. Almgren works on Internet security. He solved the puzzle with software developer Torbjorn Granlund and a trio of computer buffs from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The challenge had obsessed thousands of codebreakers around the world. They even set up their own website which attracted 2,500 fans from a 14-year-old schoolboy to maths professors. Singh, believing that the ultimate prize was out of their reach, had already given a 1,000-pound prize to two computer buffs who had cracked the first nine codes. But then the Swedes came through with the solution to the final ""512 bit"" code. Singh, who has a doctorate in physics at Cambridge University, took two years to create the brain teasers with Dr Paul Leyland, who works for Microsoft in Cambridge. They worked in total secrecy. ""I regularly went into my little garden, dipped the relevant papers in molten wax and set them alight,"" Singh told Thursday's Daily Telegraph. Almgren admitted that it was a long, hard grind and the Swedish team were tempted to abandon ship at times. ""The first stages were very simple but at one point we thought we wouldn't get any further than stage eight,"" he told BBC radio. ""When you do come to the 10th stage it is a question of heavy mathematics and rather difficult algorithms that I don't even claim to understand myself."" The cipher the team finally cracked is similar to the on-line security used by Internet banking and shopping outlets. But Singh argued that this did not mean Internet security had been compromised. ""It is the sort of thing that some people do use on the Internet for Internet security,"" Singh said. ""That doesn't necessarily mean that Internet security is invalid because it took a year for a team of Swedes to crack this with some very sophisticated computers."" ",2000-10-12T05:00:00+0000

On Nov. 8, 1999, Bristol-Myers presented research to the American Heart Association showing that Vanlev lowered blood pressure better than some top-selling medicines. Since then, according to an S.E.C. order dated Sept. 22, people under investigation may have traded Bristol-Myers shares while making misleading statements about Vanlev. On April 19, the company said it was delaying its application for approval of the drug, citing safety concerns raised by the studies; the shares fell 22 percent. In the previous 12 months, they had risen 13 percent. Bristol-Myers said it was cooperating with the inquiry. The disclosure of the inquiry was inadvertent, the S.E.C. said.",2000-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Perhaps it was Christie's sale of Frank furniture in May -- or last month's Paris Biennale, with its display of a 1935 room, complete with quilted leather walls, which Frank designed for the Guerlain family -- but Frankmania is in the air again. Robert Couturier, a New York decorator, is one of many who feel an aesthetic debt to the designs of this master, who died in 1941. ''In these days of excessive affluence, it's nice to see luxurious simplicity,'' said Mr. Couturier, who grew up in a Paris apartment decorated with Frank furniture. The designer ''undressed fancy rooms,'' he said, adding, ''He respected the space of a room and never overcrowded it.''",2000-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Gao, 60, is a political refugee and playwright whose works have not been performed in China since his work ""The Other Shore"" was banned in 1986, the Swedish Academy said. He left China a year after and lives in Paris, the citation said. It described him as a novelist, translator, dramatist, director and critic. Gao is the first Chinese writer to receive the prestigious literature prize. The Swedish Academy cited Gao for his writing about the struggle of the individual. ""He is a perspicacious skeptic who makes no claim to be able to explain the world. He asserts that he has found freedom only in writing,"" according to the citation. The prize this year is worth $915,000. Guenter Grass won last year's prize as one of the most prominent authors to emerge from a group of young intellectuals who set out to revive German literature after the Nazi era. The literature award -- usually the first -- was the fifth and last Nobel prize unveiled in Stockholm this week. The Nobel Peace Prize winner will be named Friday in Oslo, Norway. Two Americans won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics on Wednesday for developing theories on how people work and live, contributing greatly to employment training programs and transportation and communication systems. James J. Heckman, 56, of the University of Chicago, and Daniel L. McFadden, 63, of the University of California at Berkeley, were cited for methods of analyzing statistics that have had wide-ranging practical applications, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The physics prize was shared by American Jack Kilby, 76, who invented the integrated circuit at Texas Instruments in 1958, Herbert Kroemer, 72, of the University of California-Santa Barbara, and Zhores Alferov, 70, of the A.F. Ioffe Physico-Technico Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia. This year's chemistry prize went to Alan Heeger, 64, of the University of California-Santa Barbara, Alan MacDiarmid, 73, of the University of Pennsylvania and Hideki Shirakawa, 64, of the University of Tsukuba in Japan, for their discovery that plastic could be modified to conduct electricity. The medicine prize recognized Arvid Carlsson, 77, a professor emiritus of the University of Goteborg in Sweden, Paul Greengard, 74, of Rockefeller University in New York, and Eric Kandel, 70, an Austrian-born U.S. citizen with Columbia University in New York, for discoveries about how messages are transmitted between brain cells, leading to treatments of Parkinson's disease and depression. The Nobel Prizes are funded by a trust set up in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. Nobel said the literature prize should recognize an author whose work moves in an ""ideal direction"" without specifying exactly what he meant. Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf will present the prizes as always on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. ",2000-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Swedish Computer Team Crack 10 of the Worlds Toughest Codes," LONDON, Oct. 12 -- A team of Swedish computer buffs have fought off thousands of rivals from around the world to crack what was billed as the toughest code challenge ever set. It took the Swedes the equivalent of 70 years of computer time to decipher 10 increasingly difficult codes set by author Simon Singh in his international bestseller ""The Code Book."" They ranged from ciphers dating back to ancient Greece through Victorian codes and the famed Nazi Enigma code machine from World War Two. ""It is the toughest code that has ever been cracked,"" Singh said on Thursday before handing over the first prize cheque for 10,000 pounds ($15,000) to the team headed by Fredrik Almgren. Almgren works on Internet security. He solved the puzzle with software developer Torbjorn Granlund and a trio of computer buffs from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The challenge had obsessed thousands of codebreakers around the world. They even set up their own website which attracted 2,500 fans from a 14-year-old schoolboy to maths professors. Singh, believing that the ultimate prize was out of their reach, had already given a 1,000-pound prize to two computer buffs who had cracked the first nine codes. But then the Swedes came through with the solution to the final ""512 bit"" code. Singh, who has a doctorate in physics at Cambridge University, took two years to create the brain teasers with Dr Paul Leyland, who works for Microsoft in Cambridge. They worked in total secrecy. ""I regularly went into my little garden, dipped the relevant papers in molten wax and set them alight,"" Singh told Thursday's Daily Telegraph. Almgren admitted that it was a long, hard grind and the Swedish team were tempted to abandon ship at times. ""The first stages were very simple but at one point we thought we wouldn't get any further than stage eight,"" he told BBC radio. ""When you do come to the 10th stage it is a question of heavy mathematics and rather difficult algorithms that I don't even claim to understand myself."" The cipher the team finally cracked is similar to the on-line security used by Internet banking and shopping outlets. But Singh argued that this did not mean Internet security had been compromised. ""It is the sort of thing that some people do use on the Internet for Internet security,"" Singh said. ""That doesn't necessarily mean that Internet security is invalid because it took a year for a team of Swedes to crack this with some very sophisticated computers."" ",2000-10-12T05:00:00+0000

The blast came a day after 17 Americans were killed in an apparent terrorist attack at a Yemeni port. The cause of the blast was not immediately known, but British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said it appeared a bomb had been thrown over a wall into the embassy area. ""It was not a particularly professional attack, rather an opportunistic one, and it seems to have landed on a diesel generator and has caused quite a substantial explosion,"" he said in an interview with Britain's Sky News. At the time of the blast, shortly after dawn, only a Yemeni night guard was on duty, a British Embassy spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. ""We sustained considerable damage to the building itself,"" she said. The explosions in Yemen, an impoverished country on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, come amid anti-U.S. fervor in the region sparked by two weeks of Israeli-Palestinian clashes. The embassy explosion shook the entire neighborhood, said Hisham al-Qubati, a secretary at the nearby Yemen Times building. ""I heard a loud explosion at 6:05 a.m. (11:05 p.m. EDT, Thursday) and rushed over to the embassy. They wouldn't let us in, but I could see shattered windows and the damage to a school next to the embassy,"" al-Qubati said. Beyond damage to the three-story embassy and neighboring school, both of which normally are closed on Fridays, the explosion just after dawn blew out windows of the nearby Dutch Embassy. Several embassies are located in the neighborhood. A forensics team was trying to determine the cause of the blast, the embassy spokeswoman said. ",2000-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Lapierre's book is an account of two renowned real-life painters, Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter and erstwhile model, Artemisia, who would become one of the Western world's first significant female artists. It's a tale of twisting fortunes at a time when painters were used as spies and methods of art collection foreshadowed those of the Nazis. Artemisia, raped at an early age by one of her father's partners, Agostino Tassi, has the temerity to take him to trial. The ordeal destroys the family and spins her into an ill-made marriage; she never loses her devotion to painting, however, taking as her subjects an array of heroines who are depicted vanquishing falsehood and securing freedom. The rift with her father exacts a heavy toll, separating them for years. But as her father says, ''Love knows no bounds. . . . Its excesses are its measure''; little does Artemisia know that her costliest sacrifice is yet to come. Though published here, in this graceful translation by Liz Heron, as a novel, the book features extensive notes and a text threaded with documentation, suggesting why it was published as a narrative biography in England. Whatever its genre, ''Artemisia'' employs admirable artistry in depicting the turbulent life and times of two great painters. Peter Bricklebank",2000-10-15T05:00:00+0000

As in: ''The dog took note of the fact that he didn't do any of these things.'' And: ''The dog couldn't imagine what had gotten into them.'' This thinking dog caused a stir in the fiction department at The New Yorker when the novel was about to be serialized there in 1979. Maxwell's editor, Roger Angell, and others of us in the department thought that the dog was a mistake. On several occasions Roger urged Maxwell to put the thinking dog to sleep. Maxwell is reported to have responded, in Bartlebyesque fashion, ''I'd like to keep it.'' Roger Angell is not and never has been an easy editor to face down, but this was no contest. If you look back at The New Yorker issues of Oct. 1 and Oct. 8, 1979, you will find the thinking dog there thinking away, to say nothing of taking note and imagining.

Her sister, Deborah, her brother, then 8, and a 3-year-old for whom Deborah was baby-sitting, survived. But Karen's legacy seemingly did not. Her grieving father sold most of her artwork, about 400 drawings and paintings of children, and gave the proceeds to two art students. About 10 years ago, Deborah, herself an artist specializing in tile murals, began a search for Karen's works. Her quest garnered television reports and newspaper articles (including one in this section in 1991), and drew out owners of the work from all over the country. She has managed to find 278 pieces, and has published photographs of 124 of them (including some clay sculptures) in ''The Spirit of Children: The Art and Life of Karen Carrino'' (Prometheus Books, $29).

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Flashing Their Psyches,"Pop stars make great studies for caricature because of the mix of public image and self-disclosure in their performances. ROLLING STONE: The Illustrated Portraits (Chronicle, $40) is a compilation of more than 200 illustrations by almost 100 artists from 30 years of the magazine's history. The key to longevity, apparently, is, never appear the same way twice, and don't look back: Bob Dylan morphs from an angelically smooth-faced kid to thoughtful bearded bard in a line sketch by Milton Glaser to mirror-shaded rock star in a 1974 painting by Paul Davis. The illustrators show insight into the stars' psyches: Gary Kelley's picture of Madonna in the style of the art deco painter Tamara de Lempicka captures her narcissism, and a lacquered sculpture of Lou Reed, with leather jacket and still-smoking cigarette, expresses his deadpan cool. The text of interviews is unsatisfying, especially the throw-away reactions by the stars to their portraits. Printed on heavy paper, the images have an extra density and snap, but the succession of borderless, full-bleed pictures gives the feel of a workbook catalog. A major oversight is that the artists' media are nowhere discussed. Nevertheless, the book shows that when the match of illustrator and subject is just right, in the words of the caricaturist Robert Risko, the artist can ''get into their skin and try to find out what goes on in the inside by imitating the person's outside.''

Carnahan, 66, who has been governor of Missouri for eight years, was running for the Senate, locked in a neck-and-neck race with incumbent Republican Sen. John Ashcroft. Carnahan had been in St. Louis for a fund raiser and was scheduled to attend a similar event at New Madrid, Missouri, in the evening before returning to Jefferson City, the state capital. Ray Temple, the Democratic state chairman, said the governor was ""missing"" but declined to say that he had been killed. CNN identified the other two people on board the plane as Carnahan's son and a longtime aide. The sheriff's office in Jefferson County, where the crash occurred, said witnesses reported hearing a plane go into a dive and seeing a fireball. The crash occurred as officials of both parties were gathering in St. Louis, site of the third presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.

Those questions may be answered next year, if negotiations succeed in bringing two giant pandas, Mei Xiang, a 2-year-old female, and Tian Tian, a 3-year-old male, from China to the Panda House at the National Zoo. The house was once home to Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, above, until their deaths, Ling-Ling's in 1992 and Hsing-Hsing's last year. To lure the new pandas outdoors on even the hottest days, the zoo hired Chatelain Architects of Washington and Nelson-Byrd Landscape Architects of Charlottesville, Va., to renovate their home and create outdoor microclimates. Imagine the wilds of China in a 17,500-square-foot outdoor exhibition area divided into two grassy yards. Although both yards are planted with Chinese firs, hemlocks and red cedars, each has a different microclimate. ''One side has a grove of trees with a mister in it,'' said Robert Hoage, a zoo spokesman. ''The other has the same grove of trees, but with a fogger in it, where smaller drops of water roll out like fog.'' In one den, the air is cooled by traveling over cold-water pipes; the other (above) has an ordinary air-conditioner.

But state police memos from the fall of 1996 show that police commanders had detailed data showing that minorities were disproportionately stopped and searched by the State Police. Another memo indicates that Mr. Verniero was at a January 1997 meeting in which State Police commanders decided to limit what data they would turn over to investigators from the federal Justice Department.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Loud Edge of Brooklyn,"Such is Amram Ducovny's skill as a writer that in his new novel, CONEY (Overlook, $26.95), he is able to transport readers swiftly into the garish and seamy heart of Coney Island on the eve of World War II; it's as if the lights of Dreamland and Luna Park were still brightly lit. This richly drawn portrait of 15-year-old Harry Catzker, the son of a writer whose stories are serialized in a Yiddish daily newspaper and a beautiful but alienated mother, offers a welcome twist on the coming-of-age novel. ''Coney'' is also a noirish thriller and a darkly comic and moving glimpse into the lives of Jewish immigrants in the 1930's. The story begins as Harry is offered an after-school job picking up betting slips from Coney Island's carnival freaks for the local bookie. The rude, oversexed, often hilarious fat ladies and dwarfs, not to mention his new gangster friends, offer Harry a welcome respite from the combative and pessimistic mood of his family. Take his grandmother, whom he calls Bama, for instance. After arriving in the United States in 1919, she immediately ''sniffed a mean, godless country. . . . She learned no English, guarding her illiteracy like a jewel. When Harry asked her why she did not speak English, she summoned a tone of irrefutable logic. 'For what do I need English? Did they speak English in Warsaw?' ''But Ducovny -- who, as it happens, is the father of the actor David Duchovny -- never resorts to Jewish stereotypes. Harry and his complicated, unpredictable family, as well as the Yiddish poet who boards with them, are struggling with more than just being strangers in a strange land. The grim shadow of the impending Holocaust abroad presages, it turns out, a smaller-scale disaster closer to home. The story of how Harry and his friends and relatives survive, thrive and flame out is as satisfying and exhilarating as a ride on the Cyclone. Dana Kennedy",2000-10-22T05:00:00+0000

In 1990, his creator, John Updike, killed him off at the premature age of 56 (two years younger than Updike at the time), curtailing an eager, questing life that had spanned four novels and as many decades. The message seemed to be that vitality belonged to the next generation -- to characters like Rabbit's daughter-in-law, Pru, with whom he guiltily enjoyed a quickie not long before he died. But now Rabbit is back -- at least, as a spectral presence -- in the novella ''Rabbit Remembered'' (due out next month), and a lot has happened in his absence. On the one hand, his children -- Nelson, the former cokehead, and Annabelle, his illegitimate daughter -- have turned out better than expected. On the other, Rabbit's widow, Janice, has married, of all people, the crude and angry Ronnie Harrison, Rabbit's old teammate and nemesis. Though now in their 60's, they have, we are clearly given to understand, a more than satisfactory sex life: Ronnie is easily Rabbit's match in the lovemaking department, and Janice boasts to herself about her frequent orgasms. At one point the 42-year-old Nelson, now separated and living at home and reduced to fantasizing about television actresses, comes upon Ronnie copping a feel in the kitchen.",2000-10-22T05:00:00+0000

It was also a time of political radicalism and changing sexual mores. ''Nowhere did the instinct for the new flourish more extravagantly than in New York City,'' Christine Stansell writes in ''American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century.'' Ms. Stansell describes the city's ''willful, ambitious arrivistes'' who came to be known as bohemians. Their spiritual heirs have continued to find a home in the city, among them the beats of the 50's like Jack Kerouac and the latter-day bohemians described by Ann Powers.",2000-10-22T05:00:00+0000

She seemed more at home at East Side soirees and within the first lady's question-free cocoon than in unscripted conversations with voters or the political press.

The finished job has left an uncovered sheet of copper about 3 1/2 by 12 feet behind the chimney. The roofer says that he cannot cover this with tiles because putting nails into the copper sheeting could cause leaks. We fail to see anything that looks like this on similar homes in our area.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Artist Behind the Figure,"Because Duncan Grant was a member of the Bloomsbury group, his personal life has largely overshadowed his artistic achievement. Grant (1885-1978) indeed lived a colorful life, featuring affairs with John Maynard Keynes and Lytton Strachey, and a lifelong relationship with Vanessa Bell, with whom he fathered a child. But as the art historian Simon Watney argues in THE ART OF DUNCAN GRANT (John Murray/Trafalgar Square, paper, $29.95), his art merits serious consideration in its own right. Surveying Grant's career, he shows his painting to be intimately linked with that of artists like Piero della Francesca, Titian, Chardin, Rembrandt, Cezanne and Picasso. This facility with Western art history lies at the core of his work, and according to Watney, ''paintings about painting constitute one of Grant's most significant contributions to the modernist movement.'' Grant's style was marked by lyricism and an exuberant use of color. His protean output also included prints, book illustrations, fabric designs, costumes, ceramics, murals and interior decoration. These various art forms became intricately merged in Charleston, the country house Grant shared and transformed with his fellow artist Vanessa Bell. Watney deems this decorated domicile the finest monument to Grant's art, exemplary of the brand of domestic modernism that defined the Bloomsbury aesthetic. While doing justice to Grant's work, the book also acknowledges his unevenness, conveying the complexity of an artist who proved as polymorphous in his work as he was in his private life.

Analysts said Commerzbank had hoped a larger stake for Banco Santander would help fend off a hostile bid from Cobra, a German investment group, which is the bank's major shareholder with 17 percent.

Analysts said the financial maneuvers indicated that CyberWorks was under mounting pressure to pay down $9 billion in debt. The stock fell 11.5 percent, to 74 cents a share, 80 percent off its high.

us,83 Dead in Russian Military Plane Crash," BATUMI, Georgia -- At least 83 people were killed when a Russian military plane crashed into a mountain in western Georgia, Russian military officials said Thursday. The Defense Ministry plane was en route from the Chkalovsky military airfield near Moscow and was attempting to land in harsh weather at a Russian military base near Georgia's Black Sea port of Batumi when it crashed on Wednesday night. Rescuers reaching the crash site about 15 miles east of Batumi found pieces of the plane and scorched earth. Rescuers on Thursday recovered the plane's black box, or flight recorder, the Interfax news agency reported, but had not yet determined the cause of the crash. ""Rain was falling, the plane was in pieces, and everything was on fire,"" said officer Kakha Beridze of the Georgian Ministry of Emergency Situations, whose team arrived about three hours after the crash. ""There was no one to save, they were all dead."" Alexander Drobyshevsky, an air force spokesman in Moscow, said that at least 72 passengers and 11 crew members were aboard, and that all were presumed dead. However, he said that there were discrepancies between the passenger manifest and the list of people who had cleared customs in Moscow, so there could have been more people on board. The flight was carrying Russian servicemen and their families. Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze's spokesman, Kakha Imnadze, said that seven children were on board, including a 9-month-old infant. Russian media reported eight children aboard. The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Drobyshevsky said the plane had ""violated the flight altitude."" And the head of the Georgian civil aviation agency, Alexander Silagadze, said that the plane had veered off course on approach in ""difficult weather conditions."" Another official from the Georgian agency, Zurab Chankotadze, told The Associated Press that the radar tracking the plane had shown that the pilot did not make the final turn necessary for approaching the landing strip. ""It is so far hard to say whether it was a mistake by the pilot or navigator, or whether the cause was difficult weather conditions,"" Chankotadze said. A witness told Russia's ORT television that the plane had been in flames before hitting the mountain. After the crash, three explosions could be heard, witnesses told AP. Russian military officials said the plane, an Il-18 transport, was at an altitude of 5,300 feet when communications with it were lost, the Interfax news agency reported. It crashed 4,265 feet up the mountain, Georgian Emergency Situations Ministry officials said. Rescue workers said Thursday morning that they had found fragments of just three bodies, but that many more could be scattered over a wide area. Shevardnadze arrived in Batumi about midday Thursday. He had spoken by telephone with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, and the two agreed to launch a joint investigation, Imnadze. Although Georgia became an independent country after the 1991 Soviet collapse, Russia still maintains military bases there. Russia is in the process of removing its troops and equipment from two bases in Georgia, and is negotiating withdrawal from two more. Equipment from the bases is being shipped through Batumi. Il-18 planes, which can seat up to 100, first flew in 1957. Production ceased in 1970. The planes were used by the Russian military as a submarine hunter and airborne command post, and as a passenger plane by the Soviet national airline Aeroflot. ",2000-10-26T05:00:00+0000

A s chool designer and education planner who surveyed, analyzed and designed over 500 schools world wide, died on October 22 in Hollywood, FL. He was 79. He remained active in his profession up to the time of his death. Dr. Collins was born in New Haven, CT, on April 20, 1921. He was raised by his mother, Alice Mursko, and his grandparents, Ameilia and Louis Mursko. He attended local New Haven schools, graduating from Hillhouse High School in 1939 where he captained the basketball team and was active in school sports. Prior to World War II, he served as a foreman at Chance Vought building navy fighters. He reported to Fort Benning, GA where he entered his OCS and became a ''90-day-wonder'', later serving in Europe as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Infantry with the Third Army under Patton. He captained the Third Army basketball and baseball teams to championships after the war ended. He was a career Army Reservist who switched to medical corps before the outbreak of the Korean War and later held the rank of Colonel. He loved the U.S. Army and the opportunities it provided. After a short career in professional basketball where he owned the local New Haven team, he took advantage of the G.I. Bill and, at 28, entered New Haven State Teachers College. He earned a B.S. degree with high honors, majoring in math, while holding down two part-time jobs. He continued to pursue a career as an educator, obtaining a M.A. from Yale University in psychology and an Ed.D. from Teachers College Columbia University where he won a twoyear fellowship. His dissertation included a comprehensive study of the Summit, New Jersey School System.

''His strategic plans in Rome helped save the Marymount School. In Milan, Dr. Collins was credited with saving the former Chase Bank Library for use as the American School. He introduced high-tech innovations and insisted on CNN channels of communication in U.S. schools throughout the world as a tool to keep students current on world affairs and to spread democracy,'' according to his close friend, Dr. Sal J. Rinaldi, Diplomat in Residence at Florida Atlantic University. Dr. Collins returned to Washington as Special Assistant to the Commanding General at U.S. Army Corp of Engineers for a short stint in 1980. Locally, Dr. Collins played on several teams in the West Haven Twilight League where he is a ''Gold Bat'' recipient.

Coming just a day after the German government reported a sharp rise in producer prices, the news raised new fears about inflation throughout the 11-nation region that has adopted the euro as a common currency. The weak euro is pushing up the price of all imports from outside the euro zone. Though oil prices were the biggest reason for higher import prices, economists noted that prices for other imports rose at a steep monthly rate of 0.9 percent. Edmund L.

SBC is known as an aggressive company, and yesterday's application was an aggressive regulatory move.

''Every day is the same.'' His is one of the 50 haunting voices and faces in four Bowery dives found in FLOPHOUSE: Life on the Bowery (Random House, $24.95), written by David Isay and Stacy Abramson, two radio producers, with photographs by Harvey Wang. Skid Row emerged at the end of the Civil War, which created homelessness on a vast scale. The area's 16 blocks held 25,000 to 75,000 men at its height, at the end of the 19th century through the middle of the 20th; the population today teeters around 1,000. The photographs are poignant black-and-white shots, wholly unsentimental. ''Got a short life left,'' says Mike Slokevace, who lives at the Andrews Hotel, which has the cheapest rooms -- cubicles really -- at $4.50 a night. ''As far as convenience goes, this is all I need -- a nice little bed, a place to sleep.'' The men have landed here in the expected ways: alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling, mental illness and plain old bad luck. Ted Edwards sums up his life as ''a failure within a failure within a failure.'' Oddly, despite what all the men have told them, the authors insist on their own romantic view of the Bowery bum and his habitat, calling the flophouses ''fascinating places, inhabited by the last residents of a world soon to vanish.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Flying Philosophers,"This unorthodox satire by Nicholas Mosley, who won Britain's Whitbread Book of the Year Award in 1990 for his novel ''Hopeful Monsters,'' confirms his delicate, slightly peculiar talent for extracting moving insights from heady fictional terrain. The action in SERPENT (Dalkey Archive, paper, $11.95) mostly takes place in the first-class compartment of a jet bound for Tel Aviv, where a screenwriter named Jason is struggling to persuade a bilious producer to buy his far-fetched script about Masada, the fortress where a thousand Jews killed themselves in A.D. 73 rather than be taken prisoner by the Romans. As this pair and their venal entourage sip Champagne and, absurdly, talk ethics, Jason's wife, Lilia, and their young son are consigned to economy, where they contend with spilled orange juice and a possible terrorist. From the start, Jason's glum philosophizing on Masada and his postmodern impulse to undercut the art of acting stirs up conflict. The producer wants a crowd-pleasing ''flesh and blood'' flick; Lilia merely wants a husband with vitality and directness. As the jet approaches Israel and disasters threaten, Mosley astutely weaves in excerpts of the script, which reads like some madcap amalgam of Sartre and Seneca. ''Serpent'' aims to crack a deadly serious joke about the human toll of noble ideas, and our inability to escape or fully apprehend them, and it mainly hits the mark. That Mosley -- who is the son of Sir Oswald Mosley, who led the fascist party in Britain in the 1930's -- can successfully compare an airliner to Plato's cave is just one measure of his droll appreciation of the peril of fanatical high-mindedness. Yet Mosley suggests that it is in the conserving actions of ordinary characters such as Lilia that we can ultimately find hope. Bill Broun",2000-10-29T05:00:00+0000

There are no heroes in this penetrating analysis of the Lewinsky scandal by the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. His narrative, which assails the political posturing on both sides of the aisle, was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999. ''In a way only good judges can do, he manages both to portray the ambiguity of constitutional law . . . and yet not shy from judgment about what actually happened and what to make of it,'' Andrew Sullivan wrote here. In Edward M. Kennedy: A biography, by Adam Clymer (Perennial/HarperCollins, $16), the Washington correspondent of The New York Times tracks the long, productive career of the Massachusetts senator, who overcame an unpromising start to earn the respect of his peers. The result is a ''thorough, careful account of a passionately interesting man and politician,'' Godfrey Hodgson said here last year. Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan, by Edmund Morris (Modern Library, $16.95), blends scholarship with imaginary scenes involving a phantom narrator who wanders in and out of the former president's life. It's a daunting leap of faith, but ''a reader who surrenders . . . will be led through a riveting story to a transcendent conclusion with a surprise twist,'' Steven R.

In 1963, my uncle, Bill Ross, was a Broadway stage manager (he was then working on ''110 in the Shade''), who later became a producer and director. Every weekend, my cousin Anita and I would go to acting school in a building across from the Dakota. After class, my uncle would call one of his theater buddies, and we would slip in to see a show that might have some extra seats. Or we would pay the $2 or $3 that tickets cost then to sit in the balcony. We saw everything -- musicals, dramas, brilliant shows and lemons.

The movie version of THE BEST MAN (1964), directed by Franklin Schaffner, has won its share of praise, too. Henry Fonda is the good guy, an intellectual liberal with integrity. Cliff Robertson is the bad guy, an ultraconservative Communist-hunting ''man of the people'' who will sink to any depth for votes and endorsements. One of these men is going to win the nomination. Mr. Vidal's screenplay is witty, literate and deadly, which is no surprise. But it is a little jolting to see how the game of politics was so completely a man's world 40 years ago. The actresses in the film (Margaret Leighton, Ann Sothern, Edie Adams) are fine, but their characters are memorable mostly for their hairstyles.

You can trace it back to Shakespeare, to the soliloquies that need lung power: ''Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!'' and ''O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!'' Modern shouters are mostly male, articulate but without much education, apt to ridicule the upper crust. They're not poor, but their salaries are only adequate, and their girlfriends tend to be too proper or pregnant. Their adventures and aggravations in England in the early 60's can be witnessed in films like ''The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'' and ''This Sporting Life,'' now through Nov. 30. The fiery discontent of the under-30 generation was personal rather than political: They derided upper- and middle-class culture, and also criticized the stoicism of their seniors, who hadn't challenged ''things as they are.'' They were indignant because little seemed to be changing in postwar Britain -- they were wrong about that, but wouldn't know it for a couple of years -- and because they thought there were few opportunities for the young.

He joined the SCSU faculty in 1958 and until his retirement in 1992 was an inspiring teacher of design, painting, color, the philosophy of art and independent study in painting and color. He organized and proposed courses in color, water based media in painting and the philosophy of art. His paintings, collages, and sculptures won major prizes and honors. He was influenced by the color and light of spring and autumn in the New England landscape and extensive travels in Egypt, China, the Middle East, Europe and California. Mr. Zawisa exhibited widely in New England, Los Angeles and NYC.

us,Murder in the Neighborhood,"Joseph Colicchio's novel 'High Gate Health and Beauty,'' is a murder mystery: a strangler kills a dog, and then a man, in a gritty precinct of Jersey City called High Gate, a white working-class neighborhood where ones of race and especially class are firmly enforced. But Joey Scadutto, the novel's 15-year-old hero and a High Gate resident, needs to know much more than the identity of the killer. He's looking to the answer of a question anyone ever born to a dead-end neighborhood asks: how can you leave without losing who you are? The question is familiar to Mr. Colicchio, a Cranford resident who grew up in Jersey City Heights, where views of the New York skyline are equal parts promise and threat. As a professor of English at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City, he now watches many of his students grapple with the same dilemma, balancing community loyalty with future ambition. ''High Gate Health and Beauty'' (Creative Arts) is $14.95 in paperback. ANGELA STARITA",2000-10-29T05:00:00+0000

us,An Old-School Sandwich Shop,"At midnight the town of Princeton is almost completely dead -- except at a sandwich shop a few blocks from the center, where the lights are on and the line is long. With foot-and-a-half hoagies, old photographs of university students that double as decor and a griddle that never stops sputtering, Hoagie Haven is indeed a late-night haven. It is a noontime haven too, judging from the business suits alongside the backpacks at the counter, where hoagies are the order of the day, every day. Words like ''with everything'' and ''whole'' are common here; it is one of the few places left where a $3 sandwich can contain the calories equivalent to a five-course meal. Cheese steaks, Italian hoagies (both $2.45 half, $4 whole) and the chicken and eggplant Parmigianias ($2.65 half, 4.50 whole) are favorites, the owners say. Also popular are omelet hoagies, which come in cheese, bacon, sausage or Western varieties. A faded sign vouches that they ''serve the best hamburgers on Earth or anyplace else.'' Owned by a pair of distantly related Greek immigrants, George Angeletopoulos and Gus Lyras, the Haven, as it is known to students, has been a staple of Nassau Street for 30 years. The two men have owned the shop for the past 13 or 14 years, by Mr. Lyras's calculation, and serve sandwiches with a staff of six, including his wife, Georgia, who helps with the lunch rush. For a smallish storefront with no seating, the shop does a serious business, each day slicing open 300 to 500 loaves of bread (bought fresh from the Italian Peoples' Bakery in Trenton each morning). Although the Haven will make hoagies to order, the menu hasn't changed in years and according to Mr. Lyras, isn't going to anytime soon. The customers, in business suits or with backpacks, aren't complaining, according to Mr. Lyras. ''They want the same thing all the time.''",2000-10-29T05:00:00+0000
