The $13.5 billion budget plan would have imposed a two-year surcharge of 1 percent on the roughly 6,500 residents who earn more than $1 million a year. Democratic lawmakers said that with the current budget still $350 million in the red, it was only fair to target the wealthy.

us,Technology Briefing | Internet: Music Stops In Protest,"More than 25 online sites will stop broadcasting music this morning until late in the day to protest legislation that imposes royalties on music played on the Internet. The sites, led by Radio and Internet Newsletter in Chicago, oppose a 1998 law, passed with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that will permit record labels to charge for music played online. Previously, radio stations paid royalties only to composers. Congress ordered the creation of a fee structure, which will start on May 22, to offset the threat of digital copies of songs being created by capturing online music. The broadcasters worry that the rates, 14 cents a song per listener, with an annual minimum of $500, will harm the online stations and threaten listener privacy.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  OWEN, KENNETH DALE","OWEN-Kenneth Dale. The son of Lucille Eagle and Richard Owen, was born August 24, 1903 and passed away on April 28, 2002, in the town of his birth. He was the great-great grandson of Robert Owen, the Welsh social reformer and owner of the celebrated textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Robert Owen purchased the town of New Harmony in 1825, creating a Utopian community in the hope of bringing educational, and social opportunities to every man, woman and child. Kenneth Owen spent his youth in New Harmony but graduated from Memphis Central High School, where he lettered in varsity basketball and track, breaking the interscholastic high jump record in 1922. He earned a degree from Cornell in 1926, moved to Houston in 1927 and worked as a field geologist in Texas during the 1920's for The Humble Oil Company. Pursuing the innovative and pioneering career of his forebear, David Dale Owen, the First Indiana State Geologist, K D, discovered a highly productive oilfield that became the financial basis for his formation of two successful Houston based companies, Gulfshore Oil Company and Trans-Tex Production Company. Mr. Owen's financial enterprises allowed him to pursue other life time passions. With the help of Wayne Haygood, Indian Mound Farm, in New Harmony became one of the top purebred Hereford cattle breeding operations in the world. His scientific mind and discriminating eye enabled him to become one of the most respected standard-bred breeders in the country, winning the coveted Hambletonian in 1967. In the late 80's when he retired from the Hambletonian Society it was said ''During the 45 years that Ken Owen has been in harness racing, he has not only set new standards as a breeder, but he has also symbolized the brightest form of sportsmanship and integrity our sport has known.'' Mr. Owen took an active interest in restoring properties originally owned by his family in New Harmony. The house, in which he was born, the David Dale Owen Laboratory, was his New Harmony home. He also restored the RappMaclure-Owen Mansion and the Rapp Granary. The Granary was headquarters for pioneer geologic investigations during the Owen community endeavors from 1825-1860. He was one of seven founding members of the New Lanark Association, Ltd. In Scotland, an organization restoring the original Robert Owen industrial properties. Mr. Owen is a member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, a Legion of Honor member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, The American Petroleum Institute, The Houston Geological Society, The American Hereford Association-Honor Gallery Award, and The Trotting Horse Hall of Fame Museum. He was an emeritus member of the Cornell University Council, Equine Advisory Council of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, and he held an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Southern Indiana. Mr. Owen was appointed Tennessee Ambassador of Goodwill by Governor Sundquist, commissioned a Colonel by the State of Kentucky and awarded Indiana's highest honor as a Sagamore of the Wabash by Governor Frank O'Bannon. He was married to Jane Blaffer of Houston Texas for 61 years. He was the adored father of three daughters: Jane Dale Owen, Anne Dale Owen, and the late Caroline Owen Coleman, and the grandfather of Ingrid Arneberg, Erik Owen Arneberg, James Owen Coleman, Abigail Owen-Pontez, and great-grandfather to Sarah. While Kenneth Dale Owen has been acknowledged for a multitude of distinguished achievements he will be most remembered for being a gentle man to the very end. All who knew him will miss his honesty, his keen eye, his dry wit, his innate since of fairness and his love for all living creatures. The family would like to thank all those whose care and concern allowed Kenneth Owen to live life to its fullest. The funeral will be held in New Harmony, Indiana on Thursday, May 2nd and the date for the Memorial Services in Houston, Texas is pending.

Ms. Helfand, a filmmaker, persuaded her parents to reclad the house in salvaged planks and, with Daniel B. Gold, went on to make ''Blue Vinyl,'' a documentary about PVC hazards that will run on HBO on Sunday. (The old vinyl was cut up and plastered with anti-PVC stickers.)

He was the husband of the late Evelyn (Roberts) Pinney. Attorney Pinney was born September 14, 1920 in New Milford, CT, a son of the late Jairus Searle and Elsie M. (Lightfoot) Pinney. Educated in the Danbury, CT public schools, he graduated from the Danbury High School, Class of 1938, and received a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Tufts University in 1942. Upon graduation from Tufts University, he entered the U.S. Army Air Force, serving as a navigator on B-24 bombers in Europe. Earning the rank of Second Lieutenant, he was honorably discharged in 1945. Through the G.I. Bill, Attorney Pinney entered Harvard University School of Law, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Law Degree in February, 1948. Attorney Pinney began his career as an associate with a law firm in Bridgeport, CT until the fall of 1948, at which time he, with his life long friend, the late Supreme Court Justice T. Clark Hull, joined the late Judge Louis George to form the law firm of George, Hull and Pinney in Danbury. The firm merged in 1958, and became known as Sherwood, George, Hull and Pinney, and subsequently expanded through the 1960's and 1970's to become known as Pinney, Payne, Van Lenten, Burrell, Wolfe and Dillman, from which Attorney Pinney retired as Senior Partner after more that 50 years of practice. A resident of Brookfield, CT since the late 1940's, Attorney Pinney was active in civic affairs in both Brookfield and Danbury. He served on the Executive Committee of the Danbury Industrial Corporation, and was a member of the Housatonic Industrial Development Corporation.

As a member of the Connecticut Bar Association, he was Chairman of the Statewide Grievance Committee, a member of the Judicial Council on Legal Ethics, the Committee on Professional Discipline and the Committee on Liaison with the Courts. In recognition of his many contributions to the Bar he was named the recipient of the John Eldred Schields Distinguished Professional Service Award in 1991. He was appointed Chairman of the Judicial Council on Legal Ethics by the Chief Justice of the State of Connecticut to develop the necessary procedures for implementing rules changes in the attorneys' disciplinary process.

I said that a crucial issue would turn out to be whose genes were selected for mapping. From a scientific point of view anyone's genes would be fine; the detail of the first map would be relatively crude, making the tiny genetic differences that exist among human beings irrelevant.

us,World Business Briefing: Asia," SOUTH KOREA: HYNIX NAMES EXECUTIVE Hynix Semiconductor named Park Sang Ho, left, a co-president, to be its new chief executive, replacing Park Chong Sup, who resigned this week. Mr. Sup stepped down after Hynix's board rejected a deal he had helped negotiate to sell the company's memory-chip business to Micron Technology . He remained with the company, though, and was put in charge of selling the non-memory businesses, which Micron had not intended to buy. The board, which stunned Micron, the South Korean government and Hynix's creditors on Tuesday by rejecting Micron's $3 billion bid, appears intent on standing on its own, even though it has $6.8 billion in debt, analysts said. Mr. Ho, 54, the new chief executive, joined Hynix Semiconductor in 1999. He worked previously at I.B.M. and the Hewlett-Packard Company . ",2002-05-04T05:00:00+0000

Absorbed in those far-off years, he jotted notes in the margins, as if the expedition had not yet reached its conclusion. &#8216;All Scott&#8217;s men had been altered,&#8217; he wrote crossly. &#8216; Scott should have asked the doctors for their advice.&#8217; Beyond the trimmed lawns outside, the familiar figure of Tilbury, the head gardener, stooped over the rhododendrons. The rooks returned to their nests in the elms, briefly darkening the sky. Cherry leafed through the flimsy notebook, recalling the rippled glaciers that tumbled down Mount Erebus, their gleaming cliffs casting long blue shadows; the crunching patter of dogs on the march; the pale, shadowless light of the ice shelf and a smudgy sun wreathed in mist. &#8216;Those first days of sledging were wonderful!&#8217; he had written. In the quiet of his library he heard again the hiss of the Primus after a long, hard day on the trail, and smelt the homely infusion of tobacco as the night sun sieved through the green cambric of the tent. He tasted the tea flavored with burnt blubber, and felt the rush of relief as tiny point of light from the kippered hut glimmered faintly in the unforgiving darkness of an Antarctic winter. &#8216;Can we ever forget those days?&#8217; he wrote.

us,Family Scars,"Only five years ago, patients had to wait just two to three years for a kidney transplant. These days, it is often five. With waiting lists growing, the ailing are increasingly turning to those closest to them -- healthy siblings, children, even friends -- for an organ to save their lives. In fact, last year, organ donations from the living in the United States surpassed those taken from cadavers for the first time. But in the wake of two recent deaths of transplant patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York (in one case, a man donated 60 percent of his liver to his brother only to die of an infection three days later), doctors are re-evaluating whether it's wise or ethically sound to operate on the able-bodied to aid the sick. Liver transplants are far riskier than kidney transplants; still, as doctors warn all would-be donors, no surgery is without risk of complications. And so, those who wish to give an organ face a difficult choice, as do patients who must grapple with putting their loved ones in harm's way.",2002-05-05T05:00:00+0000

But nationwide, private insurers reimburse only about half of what hospitals charge them. That's because many hospitals have prenegotiated contracts with insurers to establish a discounted rate of payment. And those rates vary wildly -- one carrier may reimburse 30 percent; another, 60 percent. The effect, analysts say, is that hospitals spike their prices so they can offer insurers a better-looking deal, without losing money. ''We have a gigantic system of trying to get someone else to pay the bill,'' says Stuart Altman, professor of national health policy at Brandeis. ''It's called cost-shifting.

For 27 years Karen's of Brookside, a multicolored building that looks like something out of Wonkaland set at the busy intersection of Routes 31 and 518, has served 100 flavors of ice cream at one window and has grilled burgers ($2.95 and $4.95) and cheese steaks ($3.95 and $6.95) at the other. Nancy Zamboni, a Mercerville resident, and her son, Jonathan, made a recent afternoon stop for some curly fries. Jonathan, 14, later indulged in soft-serve mango ice cream. ''We've been coming here since Jonathan was in kindergarten,'' Ms. Zamboni said. The owner, Karen Bendix, points out that a visit isn't as indulgent as some patrons believe: the ice cream is low-fat. Before making a nighttime run, you might consult a thermometer. Closing time varies according to the temperature. The posted hours says the stand closes at 10 p.m. if the temperature is 75 degrees or hotter, at 9 if it is 65 to 74 and at 8 if the temperature is lower. And if it's colder than 55, Ms. Bendix adds, she can be found in Florida. Wendy Ginsburg",2002-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Seeing APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX (2001) is transporting, and even on a small screen, Vittorio Storaro's Oscar-winning cinematography is devastating. When this director's cut is described as containing ''additional footage,'' that doesn't mean five or ten minutes; the new film is more than an hour longer than the original.

Since then, it has grown into a world-renowned program with six schools working so successfully with troubled children and their families. Mel's lifework lives on through his teachings, philosophy, and within the countless thousands whom he has touched so deeply. Mel made a difference in such a real way. He gave of himself freely, and always brought value to other people's lives. He was truly larger than his own life. Mel is survived by his wife Brigitte, his brother Al, and his three children, Mark, Dana, and Stacy. Mel was blessed with eight beautiful grandchildren, Jessica, Alexandra, Kristina, Kendall, John, James, Spencer, and Logan.

Mr. Greenberg, who turned 77 yesterday, contended that A.I.G. has a fair share of women executives even if not in the inner circle. But the company operates in 140 countries and some, he suggested, might not greet a woman with the same respect routinely accorded chiefs of the other sex. ''In a lot of countries in the world, it would be very difficult for a woman to be a good C.E.O.'' he said. ''I don't make the rules. I have a responsibility to do the best we can for shareholders.''

Sanders, who wrote a documentary series about New York with Ric Burns, is an architect by trade and a sociologist by extension, and architecture is where his strength lies. Maybe a more apt subtitle of the book would have been ''New York: Its Buildings, Landscapes and Movies.'' From his opening chapters, he lavishly delineates the foregrounds and backgrounds (both on the screen and in the society) of hundreds of films set in New York. In fact, he seems intent on citing every movie that took place in New York -- he comes close, from 1903 (''At the Foot of the Flatiron'') to 1999 (''Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai'') -- and by doing so ends up discussing some unworthy films. But his exhaustive research is supported by a multifaceted understanding (and love) of the city. And when it appears the book could become another narrow look at New York-equals-Manhattan, he takes a wide-angle view of the other boroughs, lovingly evoking ''Marty,'' ''True Love,'' ''Queens Logic,'' ''Working Girl'' and ''I Like It Like That.'' The ample movie stills are refreshingly unpredictable and perfectly illustrate Sanders's fresh ways of thinking and seeing. Michael J. Agovino",2002-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Born in Chicago, IL, August 3rd, 1908, the son of Harry and Celia Tannenbaum Hertzig, he was raised in Brooklyn, NY. Following graduation from Boys High School in Brooklyn, he attended the College of the City of New York City College from which he received his undergraduate degree, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1929, and a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Education the following year. His long association with the New York City school system began with his appointment as a teacher of mathematics at Haran High School in 1929. He also taught mathematics at Grover Cleveland High School, before becoming the Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan. He then became Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the newly opened Forest Hills High School in 1941. In 1947, he was appointed Principal of Junior High School 252 in Brooklyn, and later served as the Principal of Junior High School 217 in Queens. Always an inspiration to students, it was during his years as a junior high school principal that his efforts to insure that all students reached their educational potential truly flowered. Long before the women's movement gained momentum, he regularly visited the homes of academically able girls for the purpose of convincing reluctant parents to permit their daughters to register for college preparatory courses in high school. He had a profound effect on many students as he guided them and instilled in them an unending thirst for knowledge and success. Shortly before his retirement in 1971, he served for two years with the Board of Examiners of the City of New York, devoting himself to making sure that newly appointed teachers and administrators possessed the requisite skills to perform their jobs. Following his retirement to Lake Worth, FL, he became an active member of that community. A founding member of the Foreign Policy Discussion Group, he also served on the Board of the local Public Radio Station. He was a founding member of the Adult Education Program held at the Palm Beach Community College and served on the Board of Directors for many years. He continued to spend summers on Lake Sebago in Raymond, ME, receiving a constant stream of visitors, including many former students, whom he delighted with guided tours of the improvements he had made to the property, including a 200 foot long rock retaining wall along the shore of the lake. His wife, Grace Koenig Hertzig, whom he married on March 29th, 1934, died on June 18th, 1989. He is survived by a son, Dr. Robert Hertzig of Williamstown, MA, and a daughter, Dr. Margaret E. Hertzig of New York City, a brother, Bernard Hertzig of Lake Worth, FL, a sister, Dorothy Weiss of Boca Raton, FL, four grandchildren, Megan Hertzig Sharon, Jeremy S. Hertzig, Sarah E.

United bought Air Wisconsin in 1992 and operated it as a separate carrier, using Air Wisconsin's attendants rather than United's. The arbitrator ruled on April 27 that the move violated a labor agreement requiring United to use flight attendants from a seniority list. ''It really sends a message that the flight attendants stand behind their contract,'' said Dawn Deeks, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants. The $8.9 million will be split among attendants employed in 1992 and 1993, she said. A United spokesman said the airline had no comment.

Bloomberg said the strike threat was not affecting the pace of contract negotiations, and he predicted that the two sides could reach agreement. Randi Weingarten, the teachers' union president, decided to seek authorization for a strike last week, after negotiators for the city said they were too busy to deal immediately with round-the-clock contract talks. If the union's delegate assembly votes today to authorize a strike, ballots will be sent to the 100,000 members, a process that will take several weeks. Such a vote would allow the union leadership to call a strike anytime between June and September. City teachers last struck in 1975. Abby Goodnough (NYT)",2002-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Connolly, left, now retired, is charged with racketeering, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. He is accused of providing the mobsters, James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, with confidential law enforcement information. Over two decades, the two provided Mr. Connolly and the F.B.I. with information that helped dismantle the Mafia in New England, court papers say. Along the way, prosecutors say, Mr. Connolly and his supervisor, John Morris, essentially gave them a free pass to commit crimes short of murder. Mr. Bulger is on the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted list, facing murder charges. Mr. Flemmi is in custody, awaiting trial in 10 killings. (AP) ",2002-05-07T05:00:00+0000

And though the aeronautical battles between Spider-Man, played by Tobey Maguire, and the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, have a certain kinetic attraction, it's clear that in this superhero movie, all the real action will take place when Spider-Man slips off his mask and returns to being Peter Parker, the conflicted everyman in love with the girl next door, played by Kirsten Dunst. This is a formula that's worked since Spider-Man was first created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics 40 years ago, and it obviously worked last weekend, when ''Spider-Man,'' with $115 million, beat out Harry Potter, with $90 million, for the biggest opening weekend ever.",2002-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"In Washington, a New Hotel With a Well-Lettered Past","The neoclassical streetscapes of Washington were created in part by the 19th-century architect Robert Mills, who also designed the Washington Monument. In the 1830's he filled entire blocks with colonnaded government office buildings. Those long stone temples were exhausting to navigate, however, making them inefficient workplaces. By 1996 one of his masterpieces, the marble post office on F Street, right, seen in an 1846 daguerreotype, had been shuttered. On June 15 the post office will reopen as the 184-room Hotel Monaco, above. Because the building is a National Historic Landmark, the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, which leases it, was not allowed to make significant changes during the $34 million renovation. Mills's vaulted ceilings and the spiral staircases were restored. The bathrooms were designed as removable modules, in case the building is ever restored to its original form, and the upholstered headboards, above, are not attached to the walls. Each room will have a plaster bust of Thomas Jefferson on its mahogany armoire. ''He's the patriarch of American architecture, and he was a good friend of Robert Mills,'' Cheryl Rowley, the hotel's interior designer, said. Almost all of Kimpton's 36 boutique hotels are in historic structures, but, said Thomas LaTour, chairman of the Kimpton group, ''I don't have any other drop-dead buildings.'' The introductory room rate starts at $169 a night; the hotel is at 700 F Street N.W.; (877) 202-5411. EVE M. KAHN",2002-05-09T05:00:00+0000

Judge Ronald M. Whyte ruled that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 is neither unconstitutionally vague nor a violation of free speech, as lawyers for the company, ElcomSoft, had argued. The federal government has charged ElcomSoft with violating the act for selling a program that allowed people to disable encryption software from Adobe Systems that is used to protect electronic books. Lawyers for ElcomSoft, which faces one charge of conspiracy and four charges of trafficking in technology for use in copyright circumvention, are to appear in court on May 20 to set a trial date. The case drew attention after an ElcomSoft employee, Dmitry Sklyarov, was arrested at a computer hackers convention in July.

us,"36 Hours | Athens, Ga.","IT is called the Classic City because of its name and its neo-Classical-style buildings, but Athens, Ga., might as well be known as Live Music Central. Home to 30,000 University of Georgia students, who make up a third of the town's population, and a healthy contingent of artistic-minded residents, Athens has always been something of a cultural haven. Its reputation as a cutting-edge music scene took off in the early 1980's after two homegrown bands, R.E.M. and the B-52's, hit the big time. The town has produced waves of fresh local acts and a growing number of live music sites since. Even if the music is not to your taste, the stately homes, lovely university campus, eclectic restaurants and sleepy Southern atmosphere provide plenty of other reasons to spend a few days in Athens. A trusty guide is Flagpole Magazine, a free weekly that lists restaurants, bars, clubs and, of course, live music. ABBY GOODNOUGH",2002-05-10T05:00:00+0000

The complaint said Jakiw Palij, 78, was a guard at the Trawniki camp in Nazi-occupied Poland at a time when 6,000 Jewish prisoners were shot to death. The complaint said he misrepresented his wartime activities when he applied for admission to the United States in 1949. Since 1979, according to the Justice Department, 54 people have been removed from the United States based on evidence that they assisted in the Holocaust and more than 160 remain under investigation. Through a secretary, Mr. Palij's lawyer, Ivars Berzins, declined to comment. William Glaberson (NYT)",2002-05-10T05:00:00+0000
us,Technology Briefing," HARDWARE FIGURES SHOW PLAYSTATION'S STRENGTH Sony's video game division said yesterday that it had shipped 30 million PlayStation 2 consoles since the system's introduction in October 2000, highlighting the challenges facing its rivals, Nintendo and Microsoft , in trying to unseat Sony. Nintendo said yesterday that it had shipped 12 million of its GameCube consoles, which cost less and are popular among younger children. The PlayStation 2's installed base is largest in North America, where there are 11.3 million, followed by Japan, with 9.9 million, and Europe, with 8.8 million. Sony has shipped four million PlayStation 2's in the last three months alone, matching Microsoft's most optimistic shipment estimates for its Xbox during the company's entire fiscal year, which ends June 30. The Xbox, which hit the market in November, has sold well in North America but struggled in Europe and especially in Japan. Earlier this week, Microsoft said recent price cuts had lifted Xbox sales in Europe, but it released no sales figures. Chris Gaither (NYT) ",2002-05-10T05:00:00+0000

It cited the bank's weakness in retail banking, stemming from overcrowding and low profits in the German market, as well as weakness in the world's security markets. Today's action follows similar downgrades at Germany's other big banks. Deutsche Bank has repeatedly failed to merge its retail banking network with those of a rival, a move that would make it easier to eliminate bank branches.

Elins says he flipped when he heard Alanis's ''Precious Illusions,'' the second single due to be released from ''Under Rug Swept.'' From that, he drew on visual inspirations, like paintings by the surrealist Frida Kahlo. ''Her paintings were her narrative, just like Alanis's life story can be understood through her lyrics.'' Ed Ruscha inspired him, too. ''He was all about words, pictures and words that became a novel without a plot, an implied narrative.''

More recently, the New Vernon Volunteer Fire Department put a recipe for Holiday Mashed Potatoes made with cream cheese in ''Burnt Offerings'' (1993).

As embodied by the 50-plus Harrison Ford, he had a furrowed brow, gray-flecked hair, a closetful of button-down shirts and a rumpled, husband-next-door appeal.

Two years earlier, in ''Patriot Games,'' he had been more concerned with family matters: protecting his pregnant wife, his daughter and their sprawling waterfront home from I.R.A. terrorists.",2002-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Throughout, Jackson takes deep-rooted anxieties about the body's capacious growths, secretions and desires and spins them into wry, absurdist fantasies. In an early story, ''Egg,'' the 36-year-old narrator happens upon a mysterious egg -- one that possesses the characteristics of an actual egg, an infant and the Blob, and which she instinctively guards. She also reads up on its lore (''The egg is manifold: called divine, it can be sliced thin and made into very passable sandwiches''), watches it grow larger than her bedroom window and allows it, for a while, to take over her life. Most of the 13 stories here hinge on a bodily fluid or part that is externalized and exaggerated almost -- but not quite -- beyond recognition: a large fetus floats through a town like a balloon, performing tasks like helping out with the groceries; cancer grows as a buoyant, springy, branching red tree; sperm the size of Great Danes annoy the citizenry with their constant capers and horseplay. The effect of Jackson's visceral, inventive details can be gorgeous, or utterly grotesque -- as in ''Phlegm,'' which presents a world wherein the disgusting stuff is used as a social lubricant. As Jackson imagines physiology's power to shape the self, each story's strange internal logic takes on a life of its own. Megan Harlan",2002-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MACGREGOR, FRANCES COOKE","MACGREGOR-Frances Cooke. With apologies for the delay to her friends and colleagues, it is with regret that we advise that Frances Cooke Macgregor, an expert on the psychological effects of facial deformities, died on Christmas Eve (2001) at her retirement home in Carmel, California. She was 95 and died of congestive heart failure. She was a renowned social scientist whose research and writing on the social and psychological significance of facial differences was the first acknowledgement of disfigurement as a disability. Her publications document 40 years of research. Mrs. Macgregor was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up in San Rafael, California and earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1927. She moved to Massachusetts several years later and in 1933 married the late Gordon Macgregor, an anthropologist for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. They later divorced. While they were married, the Macgregors visited Indian reservations around the country. A professional photographer at the time, Mrs. Macgregor took pictures that captured daily life on the reservations. Those photographs, published in 1941 in a book entitled, ''Twentieth Century Indians'', helped prompt Congress to devote more money to Indian reservations. Other pictures Mrs. Macgregor took over the course of a year in the small Massachusetts town of Hingham, were also published in 1941 in a book called, ''This Is America'', with text written by her friend, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In the 1940's, Mrs. Macgregor moved to New York City and did graduate work in anthropology at Columbia University under Dr. Margaret Mead. Mrs. Macgregor obtained her master's degree in sociology at the University of Missouri in 1947. Her work on facial disfigurement began during World War II while photographing patients at the Ellis Fischel Cancer State Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. Shortly after the war, she met plastic surgeon Dr. John Marquis Converse, who helped repair the shattered and burned faces of French and English pilots. His specialty coincided with her interest in social and psychological ramifications of facial disfigurement. Dr. Converse accepted her suggestion to conduct an exploratory study of his patients. At that time, the existing literature on physical disabilities was limited almost entirely to functional impairments: the loss of a leg, blindness, deafness and so on, and the problems of physical rehabilitation. As for those whose faces happen to deviate from the norm, there was and is, a special irony with which they must contend. Their problems have their roots in the inextricable relationship of the face to the person and its role in human relations. Moreover, it is a situation made even worse in a society whose frenetic efforts to look young and beautiful makes looking different a social stigma-a stigma that has the potential for social and psychological death. Her work led to the World Health Organization adding facial disfigurement to its list of disabilities. In 1951 The Society for the Rehabilitation of the Facially Disfigured was established. Now known as The National Foundation for Facial Reconstruction, the Foundation helps fund the work of the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center. Mrs. Macgregor remained in close touch with Dr. Joseph G. McCarthy, who became Director of the Institute following the death of Dr. Converse in 1981. The innovative streak in Macgregor drew the attention of the Russell Sage Foundation where she did a threeyear study at the New York Hospital, Cornell University School of Nursing in order to introduce social science into the education of nurses. She published a textbook, ''Social Science in Nursing; Applications for the Improvement of Patient Care'' (Russell Sage Foundation, New York, 1960). She became a full professor teaching at Cornell University Medical and Nursing School from 1954 to 1968 then rejoined the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at NYU Medical Center. In 1991, Macgregor moved from New York City to Carmel, California. She continued her consultancies adding legal clients as well as medical colleagues and patients. Magregor's last research efforts focused on iatrogenic illness. Years before it was frontpage news in the New York Times (Sunday, December 19, 1999), she wanted her philanthropic funds to go to studying medical errors caused by physicians and other health professionals. On the same page as the continuation of The New York Times article of December 19, 1999, ''Breaking Down Medicine's Culture of Silence'', the Institute of Medicine estimated that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical errors. Macgregor had already contributed to studies by the Institute of Medicine and also the Harvard Medical School in her name through the aegis of The Commonwealth Fund. She has left her estate to The Commonwealth Fund who will administer the Frances Cooke Macgregor Awards for further study of iatrogenic illness. At a private ceremony on January 4, 2002, Frances Cooke Macgregor was buried at the family burial plot beside her father, mother, brother and nephew at the Mt.

''A proper vocal condition is the basic rule for any singing performance,'' the letter said, ''without it, no matter how much willingness, talent, discipline or passion there is, it is simply impossible to offer the public the performance for which they have paid.'' On Saturday night, the young tenor Salvatore Licitra replaced Mr. Pavarotti in the role of Mario Cavaradossi. [Critic's Notebook, The Arts, Page E1.] ''The media seems to imply that the New York opera public will not forgive my cancellation,'' Mr. Pavarotti's letter concluded. ''But forgiveness assumes that one has made a mistake; no matter how much I regret with a passion not being able to sing at the Met on this occasion, catching the flu was certainly not a willful mistake I made.''

On Saturday night Mr. Pavarotti withdrew at the last hour, and after much vacillation, from performing in ''Tosca'' at the Met's season-end gala. He had done the same on Wednesday night, citing illness. A sense of inevitability and self-exculpation was in the air for several days, as everyone associated with scheduling Mr. Pavarotti tried to acknowledge that events had slipped out of their control. Mr. Pavarotti was the chief self-exculpator. ''A proper vocal condition is the basic rule for any singing performance,'' he wrote in a public letter explaining his decision, and ''without it, no matter how much willingness, talent, discipline or passion there is, it is simply impossible to offer the public the performance for which they have paid.'' It has been some time, however, since Mr. Pavarotti was in proper vocal condition; proper, that is, for a full operatic performance.",2002-05-14T05:00:00+0000

Nortel, which lost $25.6 billion in the last year and had its credit rating cut to junk status, is increasing the amount it may raise by $1.5 billion as demand for its equipment slumps. Analysts said the filing was an indication that the company could not count on sales to rebound soon. Nortel may sell securities that can be converted into stock, rather than bonds, they said. The junk rating, issued last month, set off a bank-line provision that gives creditors title to Nortel's assets in the event of bankruptcy. That means that any new bonds will not be backed by assets, analysts said. Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario, said the sale of securities might include common and preferred shares, along with debt and warrants to purchase equity or debt.",2002-05-14T05:00:00+0000

Apple is trying to capitalize on the popularity of its Macintosh OS X Unix operating system, which Mr. Jobs developed at Next Computer and then sold to Apple in 1996. The new rack-mounted Xserve computer will be priced at $2,999 to $6,500 and will come with as much as 480 gigabytes of storage and a high-speed network connection.

Mr. Jobs said Apple's strategy in entering an intensely competitive computing market dominated by giant, well-established companies would be to focus initially on the company's strongest markets: education, creative services, biotechnology and video.

Qwest eventually permitted the tests after AT&T filed a complaint accusing it of anticompetitive behavior. Qwest told the commission it had resisted because AT&T had no intention of using the data to offer local phone service. AT&T's actual goal, Qwest said, was gathering information AT&T might use to fight Qwest's efforts to sell long-distance service in the state. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2002-05-16T05:00:00+0000

If the court had believed the states lacked standing, she said, the judges ''certainly would have said so.''

us,Sweet Mike,"Sometime around 1985, I first saw Michael Gerard Tyson, flickering on a television screen in a Manhattan bar. I nearly dumped my beer. The young Tyson was developing a reputation as a brutal street brawler. But the boxer I saw was a fistic Mozart. He had a way of changing the levels and angles of his blows, knowing, as the best boxers do, that it is the punch your opponent does not see, and thus cannot roll with, that knocks him out. There are a number of points on the face -- the chin and a couple of inches to either side -- that are expressways to the brain. Hit them just right, and what some fighters term the black lights flip on. Tyson could turn the switch with glancing blows, even to the forehead. His signature riff was an exotic combination of punches that Teddy Atlas, one of his early trainers, claims he passed on to Tyson from watching Roberto Duran. After jabbing through the danger zone and getting his head near his opponent's chest, Tyson would take a short step and weave to his right, fire a short right below the elbow, reload and snap a right uppercut up the middle. The uppercut would jerk his opponent's head above his guard, rendering it a perfect target for the coup de grce, the left hook.",2002-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Rereading the piece today (it is reprinted in Kael's career-spanning collection ''For Keeps''), one is struck by its timeliness. Only the names of the movies and the numbers themselves seem dated. Since then, production costs and box office expectations have spiraled ever upward. When Kael mentions $14 million or $15 million budgets, you must remember that that was a lot of money back then.

Mrs. Whitelaw, who could act as oblivious as someone nearly blind, sat with Evelyn's sister, Natalie, whom Paul viewed as a high-strung, nasty girl who once caused all his problems and who for her part despised him unstintingly. On the side table was a Stockman's Journal and a CPR handbook. Natalie smoked and looked at Paul over her raised cigarette. The red hair was certainly not genuine. ",2002-05-19T05:00:00+0000

He gets to spend the next several years as her fellow inmate. At the sanitarium Hans experiences an astonishing awakening. His infatuation inspires a craving for knowledge -- about art (his inamorata has posed for paintings), anatomy (her diseased one in particular), chemistry (disease again), consciousness, botany, the passage of time and the biological mystery of life, to name just a few of the topics his desire leads him to. Each book he reads functions as a fetish object: it magically ushers him into the presence of his beloved. Drifting off to sleep over a work on pathology, Hans ''beheld the image of life, its voluptuous limbs, its flesh-borne beauty,'' Mann writes.

Full of grace - in all senses of the word. He set the bar. He gave us everything, and in return he was the center of our world. He recognized in Mom a lifetime companion who shared his unimpeachable values, and was able to create so much for his family out of determination, hard work, devotion, and love. What will see us through these difficult days is our awareness that he knew how we cherished him - always, all the time. And that nourished him, and us, over the years, as it will forever. He was - is - without compare, without equal. And we are so lucky to have had him, to have all that he gave to those he loved.

us,When the Outs Got In,"In a parable by Kafka, wild beasts break into a temple and disrupt the act of worship again and again, until the ritual is modified to incorporate their visits. For the literary scholar Morris Dickstein's purposes, the leopards are the newer, more cosmopolitan writers -- black, beatnik, Jewish, homosexual -- who exploded upon the artificially unified temple of American letters at the end of World War II. Dickstein's study LEOPARDS IN THE TEMPLE: The Transformation of American Fiction, 1945-1970 (Harvard University, paper, $15.95) begins with the war novels of Norman Mailer, Joseph Heller and James Jones, then takes a sharp turn inward with Chester B. Himes and Saul Bellow. He prefers Paul Bowles and Tennessee Williams (especially Williams's ''neglected but wonderful'' short stories) to Truman Capote, ''a fashionable tourist in the lower depths.'' As Dickstein's study moves forward, its central irony only deepens: the more prosperous and outwardly peaceful the nation, the more existentially anxious its writers seem to become. The best writing from the 1950's, as Dickstein says, has an undertone of hysteria, a desperate pathos, a sense of entrapment, a mournful sense of fear and loss. Dickstein particularly values Bernard Malamud's books ''The Assistant'' and ''The Magic Barrel.'' But he is also good on Vladimir Nabokov, whose ''Lolita'' he impishly reads as a sort of pre-emptive ''sendup'' of Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road,'' with Humbert Humbert as an advance parody of the priapic Dean Moriarty and ''a phantasmagoric landscape of cultural kitsch and inward fixation'' standing in for the pointless, illusory freedom of Sal Paradise.

us,'The Making of a Philosopher'," Iwas born in 1950, five years after the end of World War II, in West Hartlepool, county Durham, a small mining town in the northeast of England. The hospital in which I was born was a converted workhouse, or homeless shelter as it would be known today. My mother was twenty years old, my father twenty-six, and I was their first child. Both my grandfathers &#151; whose names were both Joseph, like my father's &#151; were coal miners, as were all of my uncles except one, who was a carpenter and bricklayer. Life expectancy among miners was low, and both my grandfathers died young from work-related diseases. Everyone in my family was short and wiry. My paternal grandfather was known in the mine as &quot;Joe the Agitator&quot; because of his activities in fighting for improved working conditions; he eventually became secretary of the local miners' union, and read Karl Marx and Rudyard Kipling in his spare time. He was a kindly, clipped man, not much given to conversation, devoted to his Woodbine smokes. I never remember a time when my tiny, shrill-voiced, constantly cussing grandmother had any teeth; she chewed meat with her gums. She said &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; (pronounced thoo ) as part of ordinary speech, as in &quot;thee knaas Jack Ridley&quot; (meaning &quot;you know Jack Ridley&quot;). Of a blunt knife she would say &quot;I could ride bare-arsed to London on this&quot; and give out a throaty, high-pitched cackle. I have no recollection of my maternal grandfather, though his widow is still miraculously alive at ninety. My father left school at fourteen and went &quot;down the pit,&quot; his first job being to pick stones out of the coal as it was shunted by on a massive belt contraption. But he quickly escaped this form of premature burial by going to night school and learning the building trade. He was sufficiently proficient at this to become general manager of a small building company while still in his twenties, and he made his career as manager of various branches of the building department of the co-op in different parts of England. He retired early and now has a second career as a painter, mainly of scenes from the mining towns in which he grew up. Some of his work is in the historical record of the art gallery that serves the area his paintings record. Both my brothers, Keith and Martin, are artists too, though I was never very strong in that department. ",2002-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Weight of an Anchor,"It can't be fun to be told repeatedly that you are obsolete, dying, soon to be relegated to TV's Hall of Fame like such other once ubiquitous but now half-forgotten golden oldies as ''Kukla, Fran & Ollie.'' So pity, at least for a moment, the plight of three of the most widely known and highly paid stars in the vast American information firmament: the network news anchormen. Their nightly newscasts, which collectively commanded 84 percent of the viewing audience in 1981, now attract only 43 percent of the pie. Those Americans who do tune in, with a median age ranging from 56 (NBC) to 60 (CBS), are regarded as a step or two from the grave by the youth-centric standards of a medium that worships the 18-24 demographic. Whatever the news each night on NBC's ''Nightly News,'' CBS's ''Evening News'' and ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' the commercials on the three broadcasts amount to a grim virtual tour of a medicine cabinet largely for the aging, the infirm, the impotent and the incontinent: Plavix, Pepcid, Nexium, Ditropan, Caltrate, Viagra and Depends.",2002-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Smith of New York City, NY, and Lakeville, CT; her parents, Richard Locken and Betty Rodriguez, & her sisters Marla, Janet, Nancy and brother David Locken, of Minneapolis, MN; and the Park and Terry Smith, and the Jim and Patty White families of Warren, NJ. As Co-Chair of Park B. Smith, Inc., of New York City, Carol's standard of excellence, attention to detail, and the ability to address issues head-on were essential to the growth of the company. Her legacy continues to inspire and guide those at PBS, Inc. Not only did Carol desire the success of the company, but also the personal growth and success of the many employees for whom she cared. Carol was intimately involved in all aspects of Park B. Smith, Inc., including operations, systems, finance and design. Not one facet of the business has gone untouched by Carol's intelligence and capability. Tough and demanding of herself as well as the others with whom she worked, Carol inspired all who knew her. She was not only a leader of the company, she was an integral part of the company, and will be greatly missed. As a team, Carol and her husband Park B. Smith built a company that exemplifies excellence, creativity, and excitement within the home furnishings industry. The foundation that Carol and Park built is based on loyalty, trust, and integrity. It is a solid foundation which bodes well for the present and future growth of PBS, Inc. Carol, also affectionately known as ''Toots,'' was a cherished wife, sister, daughter, aunt, grandmother and friend. Her never-ending smile, loving ways, and concern and love for others will be remembered. Carol lived with dignity, elegance, and quiet strength. We will miss her very much.

Putin's Russia into a junior partnership with the military alliance that was formed to defend Europe from the Soviet threat.

He was predeceased by a sister, Nancy G. Hart. Bob attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art before serving in the United States Army artillery during World War II, participating in action in Europe.

He later became a distributor and importer of various European makes. He enjoyed a notable 25 year career in automobile racing, earning consistent victories on both the US and international circuits.

Used to brighten a recipe, they awaken other flavors in an almost magical way. And let's not forget that citrus fruits are more than just juice: citrus zest (the colorful outer portion of the peel, not to be confused with the bitter white flesh just under the skin, known as the pith) has an additional depth of flavor that is invaluable.

Lonni Tanner, director of special projects for the Robin Hood Foundation, which seeks to eliminate poverty in New York City, visited 200 elementary schools three years ago. ''None had a complete library, none had a certified librarian, and if there were books, they were books that hadn't been touched,'' she said. So the foundation, the Board of Education and the mayor's office created the Library Initiative. It will bring libraries to 10 schools by the end of the summer and to 30 by 2003. Seven are already finished. In 1999, Ms. Tanner worked with Henry Myerberg, an architect at Helfand Myerberg Guggenheimer in Manhattan, to design the Beginning With Children library in Williamsburg. In 2000, he invited nine other architects to contribute work on the first 10. Zack McKown and Calvin Tsao, of Tsao McKown in Manhattan, designed one for Public School 19 in Corona, Queens, above left.

Falling sales and losses pushed Qwest to borrow $4 billion from banks earlier this year because money market investors refused to lend.

Most of the widened loss was attributed to tax accounting and the cost of previously disclosed layoffs and other programs to reduce expenses. But $223.2 million of the loss was attributed to writing off products that Ciena has little hope of selling.

Because ''The Matrix'' cribbed from the book for its dialogue and gave a full-screen shot of the title, ''Simulacra and Simulation'' has become a cult hit, even though it is difficult to pronounce and not easy to read. The book's profile is likely to rise even higher when the first of two sequels hits the screen next year.",2002-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Nuclear Nightmares,"Not If But When: Everybody who spends much time thinking about nuclear terrorism can give you a scenario, something diabolical and, theoretically, doable. Michael A. Levi, a researcher at the Federation of American Scientists, imagines a homemade nuclear explosive device detonated inside a truck passing through one of the tunnels into Manhattan. The blast would crater portions of the New York skyline, barbecue thousands of people instantly, condemn thousands more to a horrible death from radiation sickness and -- by virtue of being underground -- would vaporize many tons of concrete and dirt and river water into an enduring cloud of lethal fallout. Vladimir Shikalov, a Russian nuclear physicist who helped clean up after the 1986 Chernobyl accident, envisioned for me an attack involving highly radioactive cesium-137 loaded into some kind of homemade spraying device, and a target that sounded particularly unsettling when proposed across a Moscow kitchen table -- Disneyland. In this case, the human toll would be much less ghastly, but the panic that would result from contaminating the Magic Kingdom with a modest amount of cesium -- Shikalov held up his teacup to illustrate how much -- would probably shut the place down for good and constitute a staggering strike at Americans' sense of innocence. Shikalov, a nuclear enthusiast who thinks most people are ridiculously squeamish about radiation, added that personally he would still be happy to visit Disneyland after the terrorists struck, although he would pack his own food and drink and destroy his clothing afterward.",2002-05-26T05:00:00+0000

He worked hard and won prizes, and soon accumulated a large fortune in the pursuit of his profession. Achille-Cl&#233;ophas Flaubert became one of the princes of the new realm of scientific medicine. It would surely have dismayed the good doctor if anyone had ventured to tell him that he would be remembered principally as the father of a boy whose only obvious talents were for writing odd, disreputable novels, spending other people's money, and generally satirising the bourgeois virtues.

But after one visit in 1974, the Philadelphia-based artist and art teacher Roswell Weidner began a love affair with the Pine Barrens that lasted until his death in 1999. During that time Weidner created a series of richly toned pastels based on an area a mile and a half square near a campsite in the Wharton State Forest. Twenty of these pastels are on view at the Noyes Museum of Art in Oceanville through Sept. 8. ''When you hear the name Pine Barrens, you might think of Colorado's tall aspens or a Christmas tree farm,'' said Larry Schmidt, the executive director at the Noyes. ''But the type of pine that grows here defies being used in any particular way. They're bent and scrappy. It really attracted Ros Weidner to the place.''

(The games seen in the United States will come from international soccer crews, a good sign, because they will avoid the American fascination with crowds, coaches and human-interest features smack in the middle of a game.)",2002-05-26T05:00:00+0000

In 1892, the firm produced what many consider one of the best ceramic pieces made in America: a three-foot refined earthenware covered vase glazed a brilliant blue and decorated in gold and silver Asian-inspired motifs made from tooled paste. These included chrysanthemums, peacocks, peonies, pomegranates and a hawk with a duck in its talons. The vase, thought to have been executed by a Japanese artist, was displayed at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and was regarded as a masterpiece. A black-and-white image appeared in a ceramics magazine that year; then the vase disappeared for over 100 years. Recently, the curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, received a call from an art dealer: The vase had turned up at an antique shop in Providence, R.I. ''I was thrilled,'' Ms. Frelinghuysen said. ''It vies with the best of European wares.'' The Met immediately acquired the vase, which is now in conservation. It will be on display in October in the Deedee Wigmore Gallery of Late 19th and Early 20th Century Art at the museum. ''There was only one vase made,'' said Ms. Frelinghuysen.

Inside the restaurant, which seats about 60 in two rooms, diners order breakfast platters, sandwiches and house-made soups, salads and charcoal-broiled burgers, and much more.

After a bruising battle to get control of schools in Philadelphia, Edison is struggling financially and besieged by critics who argue that the company has overstated its academic performance. The decline in Edison's fortunes is attributable in part to questionable management and overly rapid expansion.

us,Postcoital Aesthete,"Darius Halloway, an urbane professor of French literature at a Toronto college, knows he's struck gold in Emma Carpenter, his young, unpredictable and sexually ravenous lover. She's as much trouble as she is a joy, but when she finally leaves him, he's stunned: what can matter now that Emma's gone? The Canadian writer David Gilmour's new novel, SPARROW NIGHTS (Counterpoint, $24), is a chronicle of erotic obsession after the fact, a grown-up version of Scott Spencer's ''Endless Love.'' We barely know Emma herself; she appears in flashback vignettes, potty-mouthed and inscrutable. It's Darius's rampaging mind that really interests Gilmour, who creates a professor simultaneously prim and outrageous. Without Emma, his nerves are raw, and everything starts to bother him: the incessant flapping of a German flag raised by his next-door neighbor, another's barking dogs, a noisy air conditioner in a Caribbean hotel. He lectures, chats with students and goes out to dinner (on what seems to be a remarkably lavish academic salary), but inside he's roiling with pain. It's not long before he acts on his annoyances, as well as his pent-up desire: he begins to frequent seedy massage parlors, whose employees become part of his life in ways therapeutic and -- at the book's end -- sinister. Gilmour's prose has flashes of bright metaphor, and his dialogue is alert and alive. Darius is a believable aesthete -- he's consumed with status, the impression he's making and the gnawing power of the past. Emily Gordon",2002-05-26T05:00:00+0000

It cuts across regional lines (unlike say, gumbo, which is enjoyed in other states but does not retain the same exalted rank outside Louisiana, or pilau, which is relatively unheard of beyond South Carolina). It can also be the subject of intense debate. For example, should the chicken be marinated overnight in milk and seasonings before being coated with flour, or simply washed and dried and coated with seasoned flour?

Cohen, Ruth is survived by her cherished sister Marjorie de Roquemaurel, of Paris, France, her devoted brother Bill, of Darien, CT, and her dear step-daughters MaryLou Weisman and Carol Becker.

Nortel, which has cut about 50,000 jobs since the beginning of last year, now expects its work force to bottom out at 42,000. The company said it did not expect a meaningful recovery in the long-haul optical market before late 2003 or early 2004.

us,"For an Arizona City, Wright Is Better Late Than Almost Never","Although Frank Lloyd Wright spent about half his time in Scottsdale, Ariz., the city has only one of his buildings -- Taliesin, his winter residence and home to the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. A new project will remedy that shortcoming. The Promenade (above right) will provide a visitors' center, offices and restaurants while serving as an enticing entrance to the city. A 125-foot spire, designed by Wright for the Arizona State Capitol in the 1950's but never built, will be the most prominent feature. (The drawing, above, is his original sketch.) The spire, made of latticed copper painted a verdigris color, is being constructed off-site and will be erected late this year. It will feature polycarbonate glazing and will be lighted from within. The remaining structures, some based on Wright's designs for a drive-through bank that was never built, are scheduled to be completed by fall. Approval for the construction was a bit of a ''community outreach project,'' said Arnold Roy, the Taliesin architect in charge of the project. Scottsdale has a height limit of 100 feet, and the tower exceeded that. The center, being built by the Pederson Group, will save the city from having another block of cookie-cutter retail stores (for which the area was originally zoned). In keeping with Wright's philosophy, the Promenade will include open space in which to celebrate the union of architecture and its environs.",2002-05-30T05:00:00+0000
