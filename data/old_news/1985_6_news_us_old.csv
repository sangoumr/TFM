I went through free agency. Have you ever heard of a player going to an owner and talking with a gun to his head, holding him up? Yet don't they give out 40-year contracts and things like that?

As the reporter indicated, she placed her hand on her breast and then on her brow. For Isadora, the source of movement was in the solar plexus.

S., Manhattan Answer: In recent challenges to transfer fees, or ''flip taxes,'' courts have held that they must be uniformly calculated for all shareholders without discrimination. Marc Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, recommends basing them on a dollar amount per share, not seniority. Some co-ops also use a percentage of the selling price or the profit. Sponsor's Right of Access Question: I live in a rent-controlled apartment that is going co-op.

us,Q AND A,"Question: Where can I get information on climbing Mount Fuji? Is it too difficult for someone of middle age in good health? - J. .A., Rutland, Mass. Answer:''Mt. Fuji and Fuji Five Lakes,'' a four-page booklet that gives information on climbing the mountain, is available free from the Japan National Tourist Organization (630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111). It has details on the three major routes to the summit (12,389 feet) and refers to the mountain huts on the slopes, trains from Tokyo (55 miles away) and local hotels. The booklet points out that there are 10 stages to the climb and that most people travel by bus or car to the fifth stage and start climbing there. Depending on the route, it estimates the climbing times from the fifth stage to the top as 4 hours and 20 minutes, 5 hours and 8 hours. (Many people spend the night in one of the huts and resume their climb in the early hours so they can be on the summit in time to see dawn break. The huts are open only in July and August.) Among books that have material on climbing Fuji are ''Japan At Your Feet: A Hiking and Walking Guide'' ($9.95, Peony Press) and ''National Parks of Japan'' ($20, Kodansha), which is essentially a photographic book but does include text on the mountain and climbing it. The books can be ordered from the Traveller's Bookstore (22 West 52d Street, New York, N.Y. 10019).",1985-06-02T05:00:00+0000

The events of ''A Perfect Peace,'' which appeared in Israel in 1982, unfold between 1965 and 1967, from the news of skirmishes near the Syrian border to the Six Day War. The reverberations of these events permeate the book, lending it an atmosphere of continual unease and anticipation, but the clashes Mr. Oz evokes are more of the domestic variety - a generational conflict over the meaning of the Israeli experience itself. In ''A Perfect Peace,'' he examines the disjunctions of history and the ways in which a people -and finally it is more than just the Israeli people to whom he speaks - transcend such divisions.",1985-06-02T05:00:00+0000

Of course, as time and technology march on, definitions have to be updated, and ironically, it may take a technological changeover to rid the ''historical'' definition of its technological bias. After all, the real point of separating the historically significant from the commonplace is whether performance styles have changed significantly since the recording was made, and more crucially, whether the reading in question conveys a viewpoint rooted in an earlier era. That yardstick is bound to become increasingly important in the next few years, since record labels transferring their old analog catalogues to the compact disk format will be turning to recordings that, despite their relatively recent vintage, deserve to be considered historical issues.",1985-06-02T05:00:00+0000

Here's a sample of the latest crop. PERENNIALS: How to Select, Grow & Enjoy. By Pamela Harper and Frederick McGourty. 160 pp. (HP Books, Paper, $9.95.) Having recently become obsessed with English perennial plantings, Americans have been forced to fend for themselves; knowledge has been hard to come by, with the few good books on our side of the Atlantic - like Robert Hebb's ''Low Maintenance Perennials'' - long out of print. To the rescue at last is ''Perennials,'' a superb guide produced by the combined talents of Pamela Harper, who is known for practicing what she preaches in Tidewater, Va., and Frederick McGourty, whose showplace nursery is in Norfolk, Conn. Their amiable text first touches upon the design of various perennial settings - including woodland, border or meadow - and then the details of selecting, planting and maintenance. Especially handy are the summary lists of plants for special conditions, such as alkaline soil, or special uses, such as ground cover. Mr. McGourty, the former editor of the respected Brooklyn Botanic Garden handbooks, lends his characteristic presence with such solid specifics as ''plants are . . . set out at least three or five to a kind. Don't plant in rows.''

The alarming acceleration of the rate of extinction among plant species, especially in the tropical rain forests around the earth's Equator, has led to some books that address larger, more global issues as well. THE AUDUBON SOCIETY NATURE GUIDES Illustrated. 606-671 pp. (Chanticleer Press/Knopf, $14.95 each.) The National Audubon Society's idea was so logical that you have to wonder why no one had done it before. They divided the territorial United States into seven ecological habitats and provided a comprehensive field guide for each. The guidebooks describe the forces that brought each habitat into being and identify the most common forms of plant and animal life to be found there. The result of this marvelous idea is the simultaneous appearance of the Audubon Society Nature Guides, an impressive series of seven books: ''Atlantic and Gulf Coasts'' by William H. Amos and Stephen Amos; ''Deserts'' by James A. MacMahon; ''Eastern Forests'' by Ann Sutton and Myron Sutton; ''Grasslands'' by Lauren Brown; ''Pacific Coast'' by Bayard H.

(A selected list of Festival of India activities and their whereabouts appears on page 29.) In any other country, I should have knocked myself out getting ready for it. I should have gone to as many museums, as many churches and as many houses and gardens, great and small, as could be fitted into the day. I should have gone to the theater, to the opera, to the ballet. I should have pestered eminent writers for their opinion on this question or that.

Bach's tercentennial has more or less coincided with the commercialization of the digital compact disk, which may or may not have anything to do with the somewhat surprising fact that in the CD listings in a recent edition of the Schwann catalogue more space was devoted to Bach than to any other composer apart from Mozart. (If you are interested, Mozart won out with 23 1/2 column inches against Bach's 19). In any event, lots of Bach has already been issued on CD and, while there has inevitably been some duplication of popular pieces, there is nothing to match the Baroque overkill represented by the 12 or so CD releases of Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' now in the stores.

Interest in wines, or at least reading about them, seems not to have waned. One new twist on this theme is that writers are now paying more attention to wine as a companion to food. What follows is a personal sampling from this spring's copious publishing buffet. THE SIMPLE ART OF PERFECT BAKING. By Flo Braker. Illustrated. 506 pp. (Morrow, $24.95.)

Everything the beginner or experienced baker needs is here - tips on equipment and timing, temperatures and chemical reactions, decorating, embellishing and so on. More than just a collection of recipes, this book is written almost as a curriculum for a course in baking. The student is introduced to a type of pastry - say, the genoise, a buttery sponge cake - and told what constitutes a classic version of it and its many variations.",1985-06-02T05:00:00+0000

(Budget Surplus) Would use the money for ''socially desirable purposes,'' including acquiring sites for toxic-waste disposal.

Rules out using the property tax as a source of financing. Says salaries of teachers already employed would also have to be increased. (Auto Insurance) Argues that the ease of litigation in automobile-insurance cases accounts for the high cost of insurance. Believes that establishing fixed rates of compensation according to the nature of injuries could reduce litigation. (Transportation) Favors using a transportation trust fund rather than floating bonds to finance repairs and road construction. Would place a priority on repair and widening of such roads as Routes 1 and Interstates 80 and 287. Favors encouraging flexible working hours to reduce crowding on the roads.

After a while we became sick of this, and made an office rule that all refreshments should be treated alike. They would all be ''delicious'' in our columns, and never anything else, more or less.

The principle that ''government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion'' - less than prominent in recent Supreme Court opinions - emerged as the centerpiece of the analysis.

The multifarious stuff we lump under the unsatisfactory term Classical music may appear to one critic as a simple diversion, to another as a quasi-religion. It can function for various people at various times as a time filler, as a hobby, as a trade, as an entrepreneurial venture, as academic make-work, as therapy, as an obsession.

It can be done phonetically, so to speak, with all, or anyway most, of the right notes sung correctly and in a technically adequate, totally uninteresting, unmoving way. On the other hand, there are opera singers touched with vocal hubris, whose singular, even perverse vision and style enliven scenes, illuminate the music and otherwise touch off audience raptures. Outside in or inside out.

The magic of this one city. Imagine the end, either end, of a car on the Paris Metro. There are two aluminum grab-poles running from floor to ceiling, about four feet apart across the width of the car.

How can we obtain information on schedules for car ferries operating between the islands and France and England? - V. F., Stamford, Conn. Answer:For car ferry schedules from St.-Malo, France, to the Channel Islands, write to Townsend Thoresen Ferries, Post Office Box A, Saltillo, Pa. 17253 (814-448-3945 or 800-458-3606). The company represents - and makes reservations for - Emeraude Ferries, which operates daily between St.-Malo and St. Helier, Jersey, and St. Peter Port, Guernsey. The crossing to Jersey takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes and to Guernsey 2 hours and 45 minutes. The one-way fares to Guernsey are from about $52 to $85 for a car, depending on length, and about $22 a passenger. (Townsend Thoresen Ferries also represents several other services, including Condor Hydrofoils, which carries passengers only between St.-Malo and the Channel Islands.) Sealink, the shipping company that operates car ferries between the Channel Islands and England's south coast, is represented by BritRail (630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-599-5400). The BritRail office, which can supply schedules and makes reservations, advises travelers to book well ahead because of the route's popularity among British vacationers. Sealink has daily service between Jersey and Guernsey and Weymouth (by day and overnight) and Portsmouth (overnight). The trip from Guernsey to Weymouth takes about 8 1/2 hours and to Portsmouth about 10 hours.",1985-06-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Q AND A,"Evictions in a Conversion Question: Can a nonpurchasing tenant be evicted from an apartment in a rent-stabilized building that was recently converted to cooperative ownership in a noneviction plan? . . . L. K. G., Manhattan Answer: Like a tenant in a rental building, a renter in a building converted under a noneviction plan can be evicted for nonpayment of rent, violating the lease or creating a nuisance, according to Martin A. Shlufman, deputy counsel for rent administration in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. However, a nonpurchasing tenant in a noneviction conversion cannot be evicted merely because the owner wants the apartment for his own use and occupancy or for that of a member of his immediate family. Courts have been split on whether a tenant can be evicted for nonprimary residence in plans accepted for filing after July 20, 1982. Getting a Lease Renewed Question: We had a one-year lease from August 1982 to July 1983 on our rent-stabilized apartment. We have asked several times for a renewal, but the landlord always avoided the issue. How can we get a lease to assure our security? . . . J. F., Manhattan Answer: ''No lease, no increase,'' says Errol Brett, a lawyer who represents tenants, colloquially para-Redinger phrasing the Rent Stabilization Code, which says landlords are entitled to rent increases for a one- or two-year lease renewal. You can file a complaint for failure to offer a lease at the Division of Housing's district rent office at 2 Lafayette Street, N.Y. 10007.",1985-06-09T05:00:00+0000

The representatives voted 248 to 184 to send the rebels $27 million in nonmilitary aid over the next nine months in an action marking a major victory for President Reagan. [Page A1, Columns 4-6.] President Reagan praised India and warmly welcomed Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to the White House, saying the United States sought to ''broaden the understanding and deepen the cooperation'' between the two countries. [A3:4-6.] North Korea still has wide damage from the Korean War nearly 32 years after the armistice. The country is tightly sealed, but a few American reporters are being allowed in for brief visits, and officials guiding them seem anxious not to make too much of the war. For North Korea, the policy marks a major change. [A1:3-5.] National United Airlines and its pilots agreed tentatively to terms for ending the pilots' 26-day-old strike, the National Mediation Board announced. The pact provides for a two-tier pay scale under which newly-hired pilots would initially receive much lower pay than those now employed. [A1:3.] Import curbs on shoes were recommended to President Reagan by an advisory panel that called for a a five-year program that would lead to price increases for both imported and domestic shoes. [A1:1-2.] A peacetime death penalty for people who sell military secrets to a hostile power may be restored. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said a panel had been formed to determine whether the Uniform Code of Military Justice should be changed to allow the execution of military officials for spying in peacetime.",1985-06-13T05:00:00+0000

The acquisition of Trans World Airlines by the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Continental Airlines and New York Air, would create the nation's second biggest airline network, after United.

Here is a composer who has prospered almost oblivious to the pop-rock onslaught of the last 25 years. That onslaught, which has increasingly affected the mainstream of Broadway theater music, has produced a new generation of popular songwriters for whom composing means ''writing records'' rather than songs. Mr. Sondheim has never composed the sort of pop-rock music that has become the economic foundation of the record industry. His elegant, yearning Old World melodicism looms more and more as magnificent anachronism. Yet at the same time, it is largely through records - RCA's original cast albums of Sondheim shows, of the revues ''Side by Side By Sondheim'' and ''Marry Me a Little'' and a recent Whitney Museum tribute, ''A Stephen Sondheim Evening - that his music continues to draw an audience in search of a genuinely adult popular music.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

G., Manhattan Answer: The law does not allow the parents of a dependent child who is disabled to be considered eligible for an exemption, says Martin A. Shlufman, deputy counsel for rent administration in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Bills have been introduced in the State Legislature at the request of the New York State Advocate for the Disabled, a state agency, to extend the exemption to parents of disabled children and to include disabled people who may be employed.

The young boxers must be conscious of the jeers and boos in this great cavernous space reaching up into the $20 seats in the balconies amid the constant milling of people in the aisles, the smells of hotdogs, beer, cigarette and cigar smoke, hair oil. But they are locked desperately together, circling, jabbing, slapping, clinching, now a flurry of light blows, clumsy footwork, another sweaty stumbling despairing clinch into the ropes that provokes a fresh wave of derision.

The date has become sacred to Joyceans as ''Bloomsday,'' but Nora Joyce herself has been treated with less reverence. She has had a bad press. It is hard to think of any other great man's wife who has gone into history with such a reputation for total and self-satisfied incompetence. Nora, if we believe what we read, could not spell. She could not punctuate. She could not, according to many, write at all. Her inadequacy adds frisson to the mystery of Joyce. Her, with Him?

us,DO GOUNOD DISKS PRESAGE A REVIVAL?,"As most people nowadays remember charles Gounod (1818-93) for his operas ''Faust,'' ''Romeo et Juliette,'' and perhaps ''Mireille,'' it may be surprising to learn that many of his French and English contemporaries, Camille Saint-Saens chief among them, believed Gounod's ultimate fame would rest upon his religious works. Indeed, Gounod the young romantic nearly entered the priesthood, while the faintly theatrical piety of his maturity led him to furnish the study of his Paris house with a pipe organ embellished with a medallion of Christ's head, and a mantlepiece carved with scenes from the Passion. Through music he expressed his fervor by writing 23masses, a Requiem and over 100 shorter sacred pieces. Moreover, the close ties he enjoyed with Victorian English audiences, who placed him next to the beatified Mendelssohn in their esteem, yielded two large-scale oratorios, ''The Redemption'' and ''Mors et Vita,'' composed for the Birmingham Festivals of 1882 and 1885. Unhappily, with the exception of the well-known St. Cecilia Mass and the even more famous ''Ave Maria'' (infamous to the snobs), this rich legacy has been neglected for almost a century. It is to be hoped, therefore, that several new recordings of sacred Gounodiana will prove to be the start of a trend.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000
us,  WAGNER'S LIFE IS IN HIS ART,"While sitting through a rather concentrated week of Wagner recently, I was continually struck by how far the wheel of interpretation has turned in a few years. When Wieland Wagner began the postwar revival of his grandfather's operas, his aim seemed to be to cleanse the works of all literal meanings by staging them as abstract, mythic dramas. He put Wagner's works before us as pure art objects, as if they had been set down by some disembodied genius, as remote from us as Homer. Especially in the ''Ring,'' the individuality and personality of characters was minimized in favor of overriding symbolism. Because decor was stark and generally dimly lighted, an eerie feeling of detachment was generated. We could watch a Wieland ''Ring'' much as we might view an abstract impressionist painting, imposing on it whatever meanings we happened to prefer at the moment.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

Cloth, $18.95. Paper, $7.95. IN this long, intense essay on postmodernist fiction, the critic and novelist Charles Newman argues that the contemporary novel in America is obsessed with a ''phony dualism between Formalism and Realism.'' By ''Formalism'' he means the postmodernist urge to make the subject matter of fiction the nature of fiction itself. Writing becomes a continuous exploration of the conditions of writing; tale telling disappears; the novel pursues the idiosyncratic, trying to undercut the complacency of a reading audience saturated, as Mr. Newman puts it, by electronic information. Formalists produce a literature of situation and not of character, a catalogue of discrete experiences that add up to a condition rather than a set of relations or a developing state of mind. The realists, by contrast, develop the humanistic legacy of modernism and are the positivists of fiction - didactic, caught in the bourgeois moralism that the formalists, to Mr. Newman's mind, so inadequately attack.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

Only cross-country skiing surpasses swimming in terms of aerobic benefits. In addition to cardiovascular improvement, swimming builds endurance and improves flexibility, especially of the shoulders and ankles. Swimming is also one of the safest sports. Unlike other aerobic activities, it does not put stress on the weight-bearing joints or the spine. Those who cannot perform other sports because of orthopedic or arthritic problems find swimming a comfortable exercise that often relieves stiffness and pain.

I first dined on this ''beggar's chicken'' in Hong Kong several decades ago, and the waiter explained the dish's origin. It seemed that a penniless rogue once made off with a fine fat fowl from a rich man's coop. He took his loot in a bag to the river's edge and prepared a roaring fire for roasting. Just as the ashes became ready, he glanced up a hill and noticed the long arm of the law approaching. He hastily scooped up mud from the river bank and enclosed the chicken, feathers and all, to disguise it. He plopped the chicken in the ashes. After an hour or so, the police departed and the thief removed the package from the fire. When he cracked the clay and removed it, the feathers came off as well. The remaining prize, so the legend has it, was delectable.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

''Avenues A, B, C, and D form a dirty appendage to Manhattan . . . these Alphabet Blocks have become Indian country, the land of murder and cocaine.'' Well, sort of. This novel is too amiable for murder, except of the comic-book variety - lots of Eeech! and Yuch! but not a great deal of pain. In fact, the novel is remarkably like a comic book - I mean the kind with pictures - in tone, in lively vernacular and juxtaposition of disparate elements. It is sort of about Sarah, a pockmarked woman from Bayonne, N.J., who becomes a nurse in Saigon, South Vietnam, and then den mother to a band of misfits in an abandoned synagogue on the lower east side of a city vaguely like New York. But the book isn't really about Sarah; rather, it contains her every so often. And it contains her boyfriend, Howie, who learns magic from Vietnam's Montagnards (called ''yards'' here) and is left by the war pulling shrapnel from his hair, addicted to poison. And it contains the various machinations of an omnipotent C.I.A.-like agent called The Preacher. Or is he K.G.B.? Or are they different? And do they perhaps both work for a super-agency run by a publisher in New York? We are not asked to believe any of this. It's just so many alphabet blocks thrown together - a few mild jokes about Henry James and his critics (who here are thugs for the super-agents), some surprising transpositions (the black market currency in Ho Chi Minh City is Mont Blanc pens), a few James Bond-like exploits and a lot of friendly, slangy writing.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,  MAHLER AND BRUCKNER ARE INTERPRETED ON CD'S,"Mahler's Seventh Symphony in E minor has always been one of his most enigmatic. In his program notes to a splendid new compact-disk recording of the work by the Chicago Symphony under Claudio Abbado (DG 413 773-2, two disks), Donald Mitchell offers some interesting ideas as to its meaning. He points out that the two ''night'' pieces, which make up the second and fourth movements, were composed first, and then Mahler created the first, third and fifth movements around them. The ''night'' pieces flank a scherzo, which, with its ''shadowy'' marking, continues the nocturnal theme. The first movement uses a somber version of the last movement's theme, while that finale becomes a celebration of the sunlit key of C. Thus the symphony moves from dark to light. (It is significant that when Mahler first conducted the work himself, he included in the program Wagner's Overture to ''Die Meistersinger,'' which is another hymn to the key of C.) The recording is superb. The orchestra is at its extraordinary best, and Mr. Abbado has a flair for giving phrases a subtle inflection and smoothing out tempo transitions without breaking the forward impulse of the music. The complex yet transparent orchestration has both clarity and a richly varied texture, with the important motives suitably stressed. In its CD version, this recording is surely the best to be had.",1985-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"DINING OUT;

REVISITING AT CAPRICCIO'S","THE view is one in a million, the service gracious and efficient, the ambience warm and relaxing; the menu is short enough to inspire confidence in the kitchen's ability to deliver what it promises, the dishes familiar but prepared with a perceptible dab of inventiveness. Of the scores of one-star restaurants in the area, Capriccio's may be one of the three we look forward most to revisiting. However, an absolute, unemotional judgment - one that excludes the charm of the waiters and the maitre d'hotel, the beautiful plants played off against dark Tudor rafters, the glassed-in veranda with a stunning view of the great East Branch Reservoir - would have to take into account the parts of this production that lack a certain measure of finesse one expects at these prices.

The purchase, valued at $23 a share, would give Texas Air a vast network of east-west routes to add to the mainly north-south business of its New York Air and Continental units. And it adds T.W.A.'s lucrative European destinations to Continental's Far East routes without cumbersome negotiations with governments. But other airlines will probably protest, and the Government may try to quash the deal as well. Analysts also note Mr. Lorenzo's penchant for trimming costs by forcing wage cuts on unions.

Following is a chronology of those flights and the local times that they occurred: xhrrFriday 10:10 A.M. Flight 847 leaves Athens for Rome with 145 passengers and eight crew members. Two men, each with a 9-millimeter pistol and a hand grenade, hijack the plane and force the pilot to fly to Beirut. The hijackers are later identified by an accomplice captured in Athens as members of a Shiite Moslem group known as Islamic Holy War. 11:55 A.M. The plane lands at Beirut International Airport after the pilot, whose request is at first denied, tells the controller that passengers are being beaten and a hijacker has pulled the pin on a grenade. 1:30 P.M. The plane leaves Beirut for Algiers after the hijackers read their demands, which include the release of more than 700 Shiites captured by Israel in Lebanon. The hijackers release at least 17 women and 2 children and the plane is refueled. 3:30 P.M. The plane, after at first being refused permission to land, touches down at Houari Boumediene International Airport in Algiers for refueling. The hijackers threaten to ''execute'' the remaining passengers unless Israel releases the 700 Shiites. 8:15 P.M. After the hijackers release at least 21 passengers, the plane heads back to Beirut. xhrrSaturday 2:20 A.M. In Beirut the controller refuses to turn on the runway lights, but relents after the pilot says the plane will run out of fuel.",1985-06-17T05:00:00+0000

''A lot of people thought I'd fold over,'' Williams said. ''A lot of people thought I'd go in the corner and hide. Why should I go in the corner and hide? I don't have any reason. Life doesn't stop with one thing. You're always going to have problems in life.'' The 6-foot-10-inch center, who is playing for the Rhode Island Gulls in the new United States Basketball League, has pleaded not guilty to charges of sports bribery and conspiracy to commit sports bribery. The scandal at Tulane, followed by Ned Fowler's admission that, while head coach, he had made cash payments to several Tulane players, prompted the university's president, Eamon Kelly, to shut down the basketball program. It also prompted National Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern to issue a recent memo indicating that Williams - who, until the scandal, was considered an almost certain first-round N.B.A. pick - could be a risky choice in Tuesday's draft. Williams's teammates on the Rhode Island Gulls have supported him. ''He's got talent, and I can't imagine him ever wanting to jeopardize that chance,'' one teammate, Bobby Reitz, told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans in an article published Sunday. Kevin Stacom, the Gulls' coach, said: ''He's a low-key worker and a strong person, not some slick, fast-talking kid.''",1985-06-18T05:00:00+0000

''I used to bowl,'' he said, ''but my scores were so bad I took up golf, and now my golf scores are higher than my bowling scores.'' Jack Pulford was the runner-up, 49 shots off the pace, with a 208. Joel Mosser was next with a 192 and Kelly Ireland finished way back (ahead) with a 179. Par for the Tournament Players Course at Ponte Vedra, Fla., is 72. Ireland set the tone for the tournament, sponsored by Golf Digest magazine, on the first stroke of the day, smashing a 15-foot tee shot that landed in the second row of the bleachers. But after seven hours of play, all he could show for his round was a trophy inscribed ''1st Worst.'' Spagnolo got the one for ''Worst-Worst.'' . . . In Flanders, N.J., a serious golf event involving 120 competitors began: the United States Golf Association Women's Public Links Championship. Sue Billek of Provo, Utah, shot a par 72 to lead the field after the first round of the 36-hole qualifier for match play.

Dell'Aria, assistant commissioner for code enforcement in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, says he believes three blocks is too far away for a superintendent to live.

Furthermore, his name address, apartment number and telephone number must be posted prominently in the building.

I got the habit from my mother, who said without further explanation that one should read in the off hours. So reading took the place of sleeping during the siesta, just as, later, it took the place of sleeping at night. I never read instead of writing or talking with someone or being bored. I realize this with sudden pleasure - I never read out of boredom. I never heard anyone say ''If you're bored, read a book'' in my mother's house.",1985-06-23T05:00:00+0000

In appointing the 11-member commission last month, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d suggested that technological changes, particularly the home-video explosion, was bringing too much pornography into American homes. The commission, he said, would have to devise new ways to control it. Civil liberties groups contend that the commission was formed with censorship as its goal. They have attacked Mr. Meese's choice as chairman, Henry E. Hudson, the chief prosecutor for Arlington County, Va., who was commended by President Reagan two years ago for having all but banished pornography in his suburban Washington area.

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"RANDOM HARVEST, by James Hilton. (Carroll & Graf, $4.50.) The title comes from World War I battlefield reports that ''bombs fell at random.'' One shell affected the memory of an English soldier, Charles Rainier, and the plot revolves around him and the two women he has married. In 1941 Rose Feld described the story as ''completely real and convincing.'' James Hilton (1900-1954) was also the author of ''Lost Horizon'' and ''Good-bye, Mr. Chips.'' A memorable screen adaptation of ''Random Harvest'' was made in 1942. WEAPONS AND HOPE, by Freeman Dyson. (Cornelia & Michael Bessie/Harper Colophon, $6.95.) ''Weapons and Hope'' is a layman's guide to the concepts and problems of nuclear deterrence. Our reviewer, Michael Howard, said it is ''excellent and talks a great deal of sense about that most misunderstood and complicated problem, arms races.'' Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., urges nuclear disarmament on the military. NOP'S TRIALS, by Donald McCaig. (Warner, $3.95.) Last year our reviewer, Jack Sullivan, called ''Nop's Trials'' an adult novel for animal lovers and said it ''does justice to both its human and canine characters.'' The protagonist is Nop, a border collie, and the plot concerns his abduction by villainous rednecks and his rescue by the sheep farmer who owns him. Mr. Sullivan said Donald McCaig, ''himself a Virginia sheep farmer, writes with an authenticity and crispness that brings a surprising liveliness to the story.''

us,AN ABC TALE OF THE MICROCHIP WORLD,"LANGUISHING in the ratings cellar these days, ABC seems determined to get rid of every mistake stockpiled on its programming shelves. Tonight at 8 o'clock, for instance, the ''ABC Thursday Night Movie'' is really an open-ended pilot for a nighttime soap opera entitled ''Midas Valley.'' In the best high-concept manner, the show's premise can be condensed into a single sentence, thoughtfully supplied by the network: ''The micro-electronic revolution has exploded in Northern California's Midas Valley, and the baby-boom children lit the match.'' The producers obviously did not anticipate the current bearish news about the silicon-chip business. That's the least of their problems. ''Midas Valley'' begins with a swank party that Drew Hammond (Robert Stack) has arranged to celebrate the engagement of his Franklin (Joseph Hacker) to the beautiful Dr. Sarah Corey (Linda Purl). Among the ominously buzzing guests are Drew's daughter Lillian (Shanna Reed), described as prodigal, and Lillian's powerful boss George Carew (George Grizzard), described as ruthless. Carew is scheming with, among others, a gang of Japanese nasties, and his partner and lover is Mitsi Kawamato (France Nuyen). Carew is wont to snarl things like, ''Tell your friends in Tokyo to keep their kimonos on.''",1985-06-27T05:00:00+0000

''Measure for Measure,'' Shakespeare's dark comedy about love, lust and loyalty, is the current offering at the free Central Park series. Directed by Joseph Papp, head of the New York Shakespeare Festival, this staging is set in Vienna in 1910.

He said the arrangement called for the hostages to be received by Syrian authorities who would promptly release them through an unidentified third party to the United States. Israel, on its own, is expected to start freeing the 735 Lebanese and Palestinians in its custody. Their release has been the principal demand of the Shiite Moslem militants who took the hostages. [Page 1, Column 6.] Most of the hostages left Beirut for Syria in an automobile caravan guarded by Shiite gunmen. An official of the Shiite militia known as Amal said that 4 of the 39 hostages were being held in a separate place and were not among the motorcade's passengers. He did not name the four, and it was not clear whether they would be traveling to Damascus to join the others. [1:5.] A fleet of Cadillac limousines was formally handed over to Chinese officials in Peking by General Motors and a Los Angeles-based coachworks specializing in armor-plating. [1:5.] National The economy is picking up after a slowdown that began last summer, a sharp rise in a key economic index last month has indicated. This was the first clear signal that the economy has seen the worst of the slowdown, analysts said.

[Page 1.] The U.S. trade deficit soared in May to $12.7 billion, the second highest total on record. Exports were the lowest in 15 months, and imports climbed to $30.1 billion, a near record. [35.] President Reagan strongly defended David A. Stockman after publication of remarks by the budget director that tax increases may be the only way to reduce the Federal deficit if Congress does not reduce spending and if the economy is softer than the Administration is predicting. ''The story is fallacious,'' Mr. Reagan said of the report in The New York Times.

But Summerfare has no board; and PepsiCo has told me that I can do whatever I like. And I have found that being completely free is not entirely beneficial. I have no one to strike sparks off - no one to argue with; no one to say, 'I think what you're doing with Summerfare is terrible,' or, 'We want to invite so-and-so.' In a way it's good to have that contact. It gives you some feeling of the community for whom one is putting the festival on. As it is, I don't know who this festival is for.

Jane Adams's second novel is full of good intentions, including a powerful concept - parents and child rummaging through and sorting out post-di-vorce debris to decide what's worth saving and what should be tossed away. Yet while the conflicts beneath the surface - within and among the three characters -are potentially complex, they are usually glossed over. Anne Manning, who has been a single parent in the 12 years since Don Manning left her, is having trouble with their 14-year-old son. Her last resort is to send him to live with his father. The parents themselves lean so heavily to stereotype that at first the reader hopes they will be parodies. Don is the drifting macho stud on the decline who has spent his life bedding every woman in sight, even during his marriage. Anne fluctuates between being a helpless, left-all-alone woman and an attorney in search of independence. Her excuse for her son's troubles is that she ''has loved him too much'' (not to mention that the marijuana he smokes is taken from her drawer and the diet pills he sells are from her medi-cine cabinet). The only problems the author successfully deals with are the son's; it is clear why he has problems. There are hundreds of possible reasons the parents do, but we get only abstract reflections. Don ''could feel the sands of their life together shifting and he knew that he could not keep their marriage from being washed away by the tide.''",1985-06-30T05:00:00+0000

This month alone, a Trans World Airlines jetliner was hijacked, one of its passengers murdered and others held hostage in Beirut; a Jordanian jetliner was hijacked and blown up in Beirut; a bomb killed three people and damaged the terminal at Frankfurt Airport; an explosion killed two baggage handlers removing luggage from a CP Air flight in Tokyo, and 329 people were killed when an Air-India jumbo jet crashed about 120 miles off the coast of Ireland, possibly after a bomb went off. (In Japan, officials speculated that the suitcase containing the explosive on the CP Air flight was intended to be checked onto an Air-India flight from Tokyo to Bombay, linking the last two incidents; suspicion centered on Sikhs, possibly including Ammand Singh and Lal Singh, two militants being sought by American authorities for a purported plot to assassinate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India.) Speaking for the Reagan Administration, the Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth H. Dole, told the delegates in Montreal about a program to make American carriers less vulnerable. She also called on the international aviation agency, part of the United Nations, to review existing standards and recommend and monitor improvements at airports around the world, a motion seconded by Canada's Transport Minister, Donald Mazankowski, and the British Minister of Aviation, Michael Spicer.

While this does not rule out comparisons between his recordings and others', there is certainly more room for competition with a new version of Janacek's ''Slavonic Mass,'' or Britten's ''War Requiem'' (to name several of Mr. Rattle's successful earlier recordings) than with the umpteenth rendering of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.",1985-06-30T05:00:00+0000

When his 5-year-old brother, Saint, falls off a balcony and dies, Claude goes into a serious decline. He drinks more, though he already drank to excess regularly, and gambles more, though his connection to the underworld of racing and petty crime is nothing new. Everyone who meets Claude falls for his Southern charm, but no one is under his sway more completely than Louise Brown, who has known the Colliers all her life and has recently returned from college in the East. Louise narrates Claude's history with a strange combination of passion and insouciance. She disregards ordinary syntax and is given to stunning oversimplifications about the nature of humanity and the meaning of honor. ''There are two kinds of people in the world,'' Louise informs us, ''the kind who would never sit around talking about honor because they intrinsically have it, and then there is the type who would sit around talking about honor all the time, but who does not actually have it.'' Despite her disjointed narrative (or perhaps because of it), Louise is a more interesting character than the one she is so eager to describe. Her determination to believe that Claude is a saint never falters, though he continually presents her with evidence that he is not.",1985-06-30T05:00:00+0000
