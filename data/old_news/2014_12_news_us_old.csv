Kelli Barrett (Baby Its You, Wicked), is to star opposite Mr. Mutu as Zhivagos paramour, Lara Guishar, in the production based on Boris Pasternaks 1957 novel about romance and revolution in Russia during World War I. While Mr. Mutu is a familiar presence in the West End of London, including a recent role as Javert in Les Misrables at Queens Theater and a coming starring role as Stone in the Donmar Warehouse production of City of Angels, his original Broadway debut was to have been Rebecca, which was undermined by financial shortcomings and scandal. Other key players in Doctor Zhivago will include the Tony-nominated Tom Hewitt (The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Jesus Christ Superstar) as the aristocrat Viktor Komarovsky, and Paul Nolan, (who is currently playing Guy in Once) as the revolutionary Pasha Antipov. Full casting is to be announced later. The musical version of Doctor Zhivago (with book by Michael Weller, music by Lucy Simon, and lyrics by Michael Korie and Amy Powers) had its world debut in 2006 at La Jolla Playhouse in California. In 2011, it was revised at the Lyric Theater in Sydney. Des McAnuff (Jersey Boys, The Whos Tommy) will direct.

Cleveland police officials said they had not reviewed Officer Loehmanns Independence personnel file during their hiring process, but had been told by that citys human resources director that there were no disciplinary actions against him or other incidents that they needed to be aware of.",2014-12-04T01:32:08+0000

Spider-Man, to come to the rescue of the city he vowed to protect in this second installment in Mark Webbs franchise, based on the Marvel comic. Emma Stone returns as Peters love interest, Gwen Stacy; Jamie Foxx is Electro, the latest disgruntled employee turned monster; Dane DeHaan is Harry Osborn, Peters frenemy; and Sally Field is Aunt May. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that this sequel, until a late, lamentably foolish turn, balances blockbuster bombast with human-scale drama, child-friendly comedy and gushers of tears. Mr. Garfield, whos making a career out of playing delicate flowers, fits the role, suit and moist sniffling fine, she added. But Mr. Webb seems to have been hired mostly to keep Sonys Spider machine going, a tricky task, given that the character doesnt have the mythic grandeur and gravity that make Batman and Superman seem endlessly exploitable, she added, comparing Spider-Man to Hamlet.

The Japanese once considered mint an effective form of birth control. In the Trobriand Islands, it served as a love charm. The ancient Greeks thought it could end hiccups. And the Romans believed a crown of fresh mint placed atop ones head would serve to stimulate the mind. In several cultures, mint was recommended as an aid to calm upset stomachs, a practice that explains the longstanding tradition of serving after-dinner mints. But perhaps the crisp, bright smell of mint and the cooling sensation of menthol in the mouth are what make it so refreshing to the palate. When, in the 1890s, William Wrigley Jr. added chewing gum to his line of soaps and baking powder, he tried the brilliant idea of mixing spearmint and peppermint oils with the chicle he was importing from Latin America. Soon his gum was a hit  and a minty-fresh flavor industry was born. ",2014-12-05T18:28:01+0000

Thus comic strips or stand-up routines that made Grandma and Grandpa laugh can strike the present day as not just dated but downright embarrassing or even, depending on the butt of a joke, shameful; whatever wit an old laugh line possessed can curdle across decades to the point that its rank mirthlessness becomes a kind of KICK ME sign taped to the pasts back.

Rothfuss is also the driving force behind a charity called Worldbuilders, which uses auctions, giveaways and good old-fashioned ballyhoo, as he put it in a recent phone conversation, to benefit the antipoverty organization Heifer International. Ballyhoo? Cool people doing weird things, Rothfuss explained. For instance, when donations to the current fund drive reached $150,000, Worldbuilders posted a video of the author Myke Cole reviewing Hedging His Bets, a work of were-hedgehog erotica. (Its nice to know that, at least in the world of sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-genre literature, were forging into bold new territory, Cole said.)

And when the drive ends at midnight on Monday, if donations have exceeded last years total of $681,000, Rothfuss himself has pledged to kiss an animal chosen by his Twitter followers.

As we left the restaurant, we heard music coming from farther east on 125th. A record store had set up a turntable on the sidewalk, and was playing Aretha Franklins Respect over and over again. A small crowd had gathered to listen. My friends and I knew something about R & B, and we were even familiar with Otis Reddings recording of the song. But we had never heard anything like this.

us,Dorothy and Otis and The Art of Things,"A man from the American hinterlands with a murky past and a talent for invention rises in the boom years of advertising. He marries a beauty. They live in style. Heavy drinking, infidelity and a predictable breakup follow. Age and dissipation ravage the mans taut features, and his creative genius looks rusty at the end  by which I do not mean the concluding episodes of Mad Men that are scheduled to air in the spring, but the retirement and death of Otis Shepard.",2014-12-05T18:28:18+0000
us,Wayfaring Strangers and Ralph Peer and the Making of Popular Roots Music,"For lovers of American roots music, these two books are essential. Fiona Ritchie, the host of NPRs The Thistle and Shamrock, and Doug Orr, the founder of the Swannanoa Gathering music workshops, have put together a gorgeous holiday gift book, including a CD of various artists renditions of the songs whose origins the authors so beautifully recount. Wayfaring Strangers tells the story of how Scottish immigrants to Ulster in Northern Ireland merged their own musical traditions with those of the Irish before coming to America and adding their music to the American songbook. These Scotch-Irish immigrants moved principally to Appalachia, where their traditions took new forms in classics like Barbara Allen and Shady Grove. As Dolly Parton writes in her introduction, I grew up in the Smoky Mountains listening to these ancient ballads that had crossed oceans and valleys, songs that became the basis for folk, bluegrass and country music.",2014-12-05T18:28:18+0000
us,The Image of the Black in Western Art,"Dominique de Menils monumental archival project of collecting and documenting the image of the black in Western art began in the 1960s as an aesthetic form of resistance to anti-black racism at the height of the civil rights movement. But with the publication of the fifth volume, concentrating on the 20th century, it has become a necessary cultural resource documenting the visual construction of blackness over the past 5,000 years. This latest and perhaps last volume  subdivided into two parts, The Impact of Africa and The Rise of Black Artists  redirects the underlying colonialist, Eurocentric framing of the previous four volumes. The co-editors, David Bindman and Henry Louis Gates Jr., bring focus to black artists globally as makers of their own art and imagery, rather than solely the subjects of others fantasies and fascination. Though some attention is paid to overtly racist imagery popular in the first half of the 20th century, the books as a pair stand in line with de Menils original, corrective intent to assert presence. Given the volumes title and the original terms of de Menils archival project, a reader could not be faulted for anticipating a salon installation of numerous images  but in fact, brilliant essays by the likes of Deborah Willis, Christian Weikop, Petrine Archer and many other noted scholars richly motivate this endeavor.",2014-12-05T18:28:20+0000

Our moment of texts and tweets, of cutting and pasting, of sampling and repurposing provides irresistible grist for collagists, their medium ideally suited for our smartphone-fragmented consciousness. Benjamins recent descendants include the likes of Jonathan Lethem (who assembled an entire Harpers Magazine essay about plagiarism using other sources), David Shields (whose manifesto, Reality Hunger, is similarly Frankensteined together) and now the Canadian author Diane Schoemperlen, the author of several story collections and three novels.

us,Photography,"Vivian Maier, who worked mostly in domestic service, mostly in Chicago, was a serious photographer who shot some 100,000 images over upward of 40 years. Although those who knew her  primarily the children in her care; she had no real intimates  were aware that she took pictures, she never published or exhibited them, and rarely showed them to others. Her work came to general attention only when, in 2007, two years before her death, five storage lockers on which she had failed to keep up payments were emptied and their contents auctioned off. By the time the buyers realized what they had on their hands, she had died. John Maloof, who bought most of it, put up a selection of scans on a website, which immediately went viral; Maier posthumously became a media sensation. Maloofs VIVIAN MAIER: A Photographer Found (Harper Design, $80), with text by Marvin Heiferman, is already the fifth book of her photographs to have been published.",2014-12-05T18:28:22+0000

He made his mark in the 70s, when he haunted print shops and auction houses and assembled a major collection. Eccentric and wide-ranging, his holdings mingled classic images from the 19th century  misty views of French forests, soulful portraits of poets  with contemporary images of brazen eroticism. Was photography art? Wagstaffs lover, Robert Mapplethorpe, answered the question with a vengeance, yoking an austere, nearly arctic elegance to images of flowers, male nudes and the rituals of sadomasochism.

In the past two decades, she has starred in at least 20 new biographies, six museum exhibitions and six novels. Three editions of her correspondence have also appeared during this time, as have many more studies (of Napoleon and other Bonapartes) in which she features. The latest addition to this corpus is Ambition and Desire: The Dangerous Life of Josephine Bonaparte, by Kate Williams, a biographer of Queen Victoria and Emma Hamilton. Beyond her appreciation for flawed, vulnerable, engaging, powerful women, Williams does not seem to have a compelling reason to tell this story. In the absence of new material or a new approach, she offers a breathless paean to the woman who, while no great beauty, could with one twitch of her skirt . . . enthrall the man who terrorized Europe.",2014-12-05T18:28:28+0000

It helps that Poehler is upfront about her exhaustion, given that she is a 43-year-old sitcom star who shoots 12 hours of television a day while mothering two children under 7. Even when Poehler does sleep, she wakes herself up 20 to 30 times a night (according to a Beverly Hills sleep clinic) and, apparently, snores like a dragon. She freely allows that Yes Please is a spontaneous overflow in the middle of chaos, not tranquillity, a thing written on subways and planes, ugly and in pieces. And in the end, no apologies. She finished the job. Perfection is a luxury. As improvs godfather Del Close used to say: Dont think. Get out of your head, Poehler writes. Stop planning and just go. ",2014-12-05T18:28:30+0000

At the time, the 27-year-old Irish upstart had yet to write any of the works that would earn his fame. Undercredentialed as Wilde then was, his verbal verve and outlandish dress (satin breeches, velvet jackets, black cape) had made him a sought-after dinner guest in London and prompted a 10-month American tour, where his brio met with an ecstatic reception. It was a superb performance, a masterpiece of sparkling wit and gaiety, wrote one audience member in an account of the event. Never before, or since, have I heard anything that compared to it.

In our cover story, the 11-year-old actress Quvenzhan Wallis, star of the new Annie remake, takes us roller skating and proves that, sometimes, the best things do come in small packages. In London, Jody Rosen follows a man through The Knowledge, the grueling  and, some might say, anachronistic  years-long qualification process to become one of the citys cab drivers. In a sunnier locale, we explore the all-night debauchery of Ibiza, where an influx of billionaires and celebrity influencers is bent on reinventing the islands image (if not tamping down its fun). And in a 19th-century castle in rural Ireland, we pay a visit to the controversial, duck-obsessed artist Gottfried Helnwein, whose tight-knit clan and macabre digs call to mind a real-life Addams Family. Elsewhere, Andrew OHagan pours one out for sobriety, with mixed results; a lifelong devotee of the Vermont Country Store waxes nostalgic on its down-home charms; Hollywoods hottest stars make a break for Broadway; and in the spirit of the season, we share a compendium of covetable gifts made by under-the-radar artisans from around the world.

Morena Baccarin plays Rachel, Jacobs favorite; Debra Winger is Rebecca, his mother; and Will Tudor is Joseph, Dinahs brother. Fans of the novel will no doubt watch and revel in this relatively big-budget treatment, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times. Others might find its pseudo-biblical, pseudo-feminist mix hard to take. Yes, women tend to get short shrift in the Bible once Eve disappears, but this is a decidedly Lifetime version of their unknown story  episodes of love at first sight followed by sexual ecstasy; lots of child-birthing; a tent where the sisterhood keeps the flame while stupid, callous men rage outside.

Food is daily rising in price at Vienna. The cost of chocolate and cocoa has doubled and foodstuffs generally are becoming exhausted. The shop windows are becoming empty and taxicabs have stopped running because the military authorities have confiscated the entire supply of petroleum and have forbidden the refineries to supply the trade. The stocks of dealers will be exhausted soon. Signor Salandras speech is still the subject of conversation here. In normal times, no doubt, the cry of Long Iive an Italian Trieste! which re-echoed through the Chamber of Deputies after this important pronouncement, would have resulted in a diplomatic protest, but on this occasion the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador has remained silent.

The Vicomte, a former chamberlain and bosom friend to the Emperor, who, notwithstanding his age, made the severe journey from Paris, unmindful of the terrible cold of the passage through the mountains of Spain to be a t the side of his old and adored m aster in his hour of great trial, and place his remaining years and services at the disposal of Dom Pedro. He continued No, sir, the Emperor would never return, even if they begged him. Never! The Emperor, while conversing generally and freely, refused to touch upon any subject concerning the political situation. He said they had a very good voyage, with beautiful weather, but his lips were sealed upon political topics. Princess Isabella said: I cannot understand this Revolution having taken place during my fathers lifetime after a reign of forty-nine years. Had it occurred after I had come to the throne I should not have been so surprised. So closes a page of history which must touch the hearts of everybody with sadness and sympathy for an aged and enlightened Monarch upon whom so terrible a blow has fallen at the end of a long and useful life.

Says"," The World Health Organization reported steep declines in malaria cases and deaths compared with 2000 in a report released early Tuesday, saying the progress was particularly notable in Africa, where the disease is most prevalent. But the W.H.O. coupled the news on malaria with a warning that it could worsen again in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries worst hit by the Ebola virus, which has overwhelmed their public health systems. In its World Malaria Report 2014, the W.H.O. said the malaria mortality rate fell by 47 percent worldwide and by 54 percent in the Africa region between 2000 and 2013. It attributed the improvement largely to advances in diagnostic tests as well as increases in the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and effective drug therapies. Malaria was responsible for about 584,000 deaths worldwide last year. While the scope of Ebola pales in comparison, it is far deadlier. In the W.H.O.s latest Ebola update, on Monday, it reported 17,800 cases, including 6,331 deaths, since the outbreak began early this year. ",2014-12-09T01:57:33+0000

They saidLibyamust hand over Mr. Qaddafi for trial inThe Hague, as ordered by the court. He is accused of murder and persecution of civilians during the uprising that toppled his father, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. It is unclear what the Council could do, given thatLibyais mired in chaos and fighting.

us,Whats on TV Friday,"9 P.M. (Starz) TRUST ME (2014) Clark Gregg (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) wrote, directed and stars in this black comedy about Hollywood wheeling and dealing, centered on Howard Holloway, a floundering agent specializing in child actors. He should know: Howard used to be one himself, until his career sank 36 years earlier with a Jan-Michael Vincent surf movie that was never made. But a chance meeting with a wildly talented 13-year-old from Oklahoma (Saxon Sharbino) with a controlling, alcoholic father (Paul Sparks) might be his road to redemption. Felicity Huffman plays the producer of a new vampire franchise, and Allison Janney is her casting director, both of whom loathe Howard; Sam Rockwell is his client-poaching archrival. The performances and some of the writing are the movies strongest elements, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Sharbino has the radiance and skills to be a teenage megastar in a Twilight'-like series. He said Mr. Gregg succeeds in finding some humanity inside a dislikable creep. But as the movie picks up speed and undergoes sudden, confusing plot reversals, it loses its satirical edge, he added. You cant help wondering if the production ran out of money while racing to meet a deadline.",2014-12-12T06:00:03+0000

us,Nutcracker Moves to Milder Climes,"In the last scene of the first act of American Ballet Theaters The Nutcracker, choreographed by Alexei Ratmansky, a gentle snow suddenly turns into a blizzard, a thrilling dark detour in this acclaimed production. But after last years harsh winter, Ballet Theater has had enough. Or perhaps after five years, it has been unable to find a real toehold in this citys crowded Nutcracker marketplace. Either way, the company is off to Southern California: Beginning next year, Ballet Theaters The Nutcracker will become an annual tradition at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa. Which means this is your last chance to see Mr. Ratmanskys astute interpretation of the holiday classic in New York. All the ingredients are there: the opening party, the Christmas tree on steroids, a world tour of cultural stereotypes. But the great adventure at the heart of this version is the journey from adolescence to adulthood, dramatized with touching innocence and wonder.

Its been decades since the last major museum show devoted to it, but even a quick tour of Fiber: Sculpture 1960-Present at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, tells us what weve been missing. If youre thinking braided rugs and samplers, think again. Much of the work in this survey of 33 artists is spectacularly space filling. A suspended three-dimensional sculpture of knotted sisal by the Croatian artist Jagoda Buic is as big as a ballroom chandelier. A new work by the great Sheila Hicks pours down, a Niagara of silk and linen cords, from the ceiling. Some of the quietest things are the most beautiful, like Lenore Tawneys revolutionary open-weave Dark River from 1961.

John Lennon and Paul McCartney did not win in the songwriting category; that honor went to Bob Dylan instead. But they were among the runners-up, and in its citation to explain why, the new New Republic made the kind of gaffe the old New Republic would probably have avoided: Two of the three Beatles songs it alluded to werent written by Lennon or McCartney. (There was something in the way they came together, the citation read, the way they moved, the way they twisted and shouted. But George Harrison wrote Something, while Twist and Shout isnt a Beatles original at all; it was written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns. The one song the magazine got right, more or less, was Come Together.) The Beatles fare better in a new book by their longtime Boswell, Hunter Davies, whose collection The Beatles Lyrics enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 15. In gathering as many handwritten drafts as he could, including crossouts and false starts, Davies traces the evolution of some of rock n rolls most enduring songs. The further we get from them, he writes of the Beatles in his introduction, the bigger they become. Daviess book has been greeted with almost religious devotion in some quarters. When the lyrics, like those for The Word and Baby Youre a Rich Man, include multicolored doodlings by a presumably stoned author, Andy Gill wrote in the British newspaper The Independent recently, theyre like the primitivist equivalent of illuminated manuscripts.",2014-12-12T16:38:14+0000

His Cinderella-like heroine grew up fatherless, a poor relation surrounded by warring court factions. Still a teenager when the death of successive relatives left her to inherit her uncles throne, Victoria was faced with a series of fragile coalition governments, labor unrest at home, a famine in Ireland, revolutions on the other side of the Channel, a spectacularly mismanaged war in the Crimea  and thats just in the first two decades.

Anyone who has raised a child will know how assaultive the abundance of such parenting advice can feel, how dreary it is to be told constantly that if you only did (or, indeed, had done) something slightly different, your childs problems would evanesce, and you would have, through the alchemy of nurture, a child who is happy / well behaved / nonviolent / good at math / successful / self-motivated / popular / thin.

The prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, left, said that given her limited resources and the lack of political will, she had no other choice, even as the decade-long violence in Darfur, in western Sudan, was worsening and government-run militias had stepped up attacks against civilians, especially women. Ms. Bensouda called for a dramatic shift in the Councils approach and for concrete solutions to get arrests. In 2005, the Security Council asked the court to open a criminal investigation of Sudans campaign against civilians and rebel groups in Darfur. As a result, the court indicted President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, his defense minister and two other associates on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. But when the officials traveled abroad, other countries refused to arrest them. The court has no police force of its own, and the prosecutors complaints to the Council were ignored, she said. We find ourselves in a stalemate that can only embolden perpetrators, Ms. Bensouda said. The indictments, however, will remain in place. ",2014-12-13T01:56:34+0000

Snorkel-equipped fire trucks poured 15,000 gallons of water a minute into the upper floors of the seven-story specialty store for six hours. Four hundred firemen fought the blaze. The fire apparently was caused by a series of explosions in the escalator system. Firemen dashed back and forth in front of display windows filled with expensive imported silk robes Steuben cut glass, diamonds, pearls and a liquor display featuring a German 1953 vintage wine selling for $62 a bottle. It was Tuckenbeerdauslese.

While the silliness of quantum spirituality is apparent enough these days, the possibility that Eastern traditions might have something to say to science did not disappear. Instead, a more natural locus for that encounter was found in the study of the mind.

In the 1420s, in a village in northeastern France, an illiterate teenage peasant girl has a series of visions telling her that God wants her to lead a French army to lift the English siege of Orlans and help crown the dauphin, Charles, king in the cathedral at Reims. Putting on mens clothing and winning over everyone by force of character and belief, she gets her army and triumphantly achieves all that the voices have foretold. Pious, outspoken, stubborn and recklessly courageous, she breaks every rule of gender, class and organized religion, and the people flock to her. Then comes her fall. Sidelined at court, she waits too long to launch an unsuccessful attack on English-occupied Paris, during which she is wounded, and then in a skirmish at Compigne she is captured. Abandoned by the king, she is cruelly imprisoned, tried as a heretic and witch, then burned at the stake. The light of revelation ends in the agony of fire, and the legend of Joan of Arc is born.",2014-12-19T18:39:34+0000

While the reviews were mixed for The River, a dark tale of a man who brings his girlfriend to a fishing cabin, the box-office power of Mr. Jackman (above)  a Tony winner as well as a movie action hero  is potent enough to reliably sell out performances.

The United Nations called the cease-fire a hopeful gesture. The FARC has been pushing for a bilateral truce, but President Juan Manuel Santos has repeatedly refused, saying he will continue the governments military offensive.

Having already destroyed the belfry of the famous church, the Germans are now probably bent on leaving not one stone of it upon another. But although the army of Kultur may destroy the beauties of helpless French cities, it is having no success when opposing itself to the French troops. In front of Arras the French artillery threw such a rain of shells into the enemys lines that no fewer than thirty-six cannon were silenced. Immediately after the infantry advanced, and after a hand-to-hand fight gained several trenches. The cavalry also took a distinguished part, the cuirassiers nailing the German artillerymen at their guns. Not satisfied with working further havoc in Arras, the Germans have also had recourse to another one of their favorite diversions, and have bombarded the hospital in Ypres. Such tactics on the part of the Germans generally indicate that they can make no headway in legitimate fighting. This view is, in fact, frankly expressed by a war correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt.  The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 22, 1914",2014-12-21T11:54:42+0000

(Showtime 2) LEE DANIELS THE BUTLER (2013) Inspired by the real story of Eugene Allen, Mr. Daniels follows a White House butler, Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), and his wife, Gloria (Oprah Winfrey), as history  particularly the civil rights movement  unfolds over seven presidential administrations. A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called the film a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial. Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecils close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf, Mr. Scott wrote.  'The Butler has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at eachs point of view. He added: We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.",2014-12-21T15:28:57+0000

Todays two votes made the current presidential election the longest in the 18-year-old history of the Italian Republic. The previous record was the nine ballots it took in 1962 to elect Antonio Segni president. Mr. Segni resigned earlier this month after it became clear that he would not be able to perform the functions of the office as a result of a stroke he suffered in August. The voting today was also marked by the appearance, for the first time on the ballot, of Deputy Premier Pietro Nennis name. Mr. Nenni, long an outsider in government affairs, is leader of the left-wing Socialists. He joined the government of Premier Aldo Moro last year in its opening to the left. Former Premier Giovanni Leone, the official Christian Democrat candidate, polled 299 votes tonight  six less than in the ninth ballot this morning. A total of 482 votes are needed for election. The Social Democrats and Republicans, as well as the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement, abstained in tonights vote. Legislators nearly came to blows in the morning session when Communists and Fascists jeered and shouted at each other. It was the first such outbreak since balloting began Dec. 16.

Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday that it had risen to 56 from 33. Over the weekend, the police killed two Bodo militants and recovered a cache of arms during a counterterrorism raid, and some officials said the Assam attacks might have been planned as revenge.

(HBO2) ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) Beneath glum, gray skies in suburban New York, deeply wounded adults find each other, love each other and take extraordinary medical measures to forget each other. Joel (Jim Carrey) is a man as dull and listless as the weather, and Clem (Kate Winslet, exuding wounded charm) is a brilliant and scatterbrained young woman who briefly makes his existence pop. They may have known each other once before; the script, written by Charlie Kaufman, reveals the truth of the on-screen relationships slowly and with obvious glee. Clem and Joel and who-knows-how-many of the other characters have turned to a process developed by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to burn away their most hurtful memories of each other. Much of the films second half is set within Joels mind, as he witnesses his memories destruction in real time.

After hundreds of pages of love, lust, passion, fear, exhilaration, disappointment, exhaustion, aggression and, probably most important, jealousy, they are having their final fight. Leo Tolstoy is describing Anna ascribing an emotion to a man whose love she needs so desperately that she is convinced he has stopped loving her. Consider also this: When she lifted her coffee cup, she extended her pinkie away from it  a precious gesture that signals just how far this domesticated, miserable Anna has come from the glamorous young woman she was at the beginning of the novel; she made a sound with her lips  and she realized this when she lifted her gaze and saw Vronsky looking at her.

There will be plum puddings in the trenches. Judging by present portents, it is probable that the plum puddings will be eaten under fire. King Albert has placed an order for 40,000 boxes of cigars, which will be given as Christmas presents to Belgian soldiers at the front. Each man will receive twenty-five cigars in a special box.

On New Years Eve the citys clubs, restaurants, bars and concert halls welcome them all for the annual night of (mostly) premium prices and ritual excess. Electronic dance music has taken over Madison Square Garden, where jam bands like Phish long claimed New Years Eve; the newer arena in town, Barclays Center, reaches back generationally to Elton John.

(TMC) FRUITVALE STATION (2013) In the small hours of New Years Day, 2009, an unarmed young black man named Oscar Grant III, handcuffed and lying on his belly, was shot and killed by a white police officer in the Fruitvale subway station in Oakland, Calif. The director Ryan Cooglers first feature film, which won a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, carefully reconstructs the last 24 hours of Mr. Grants life. Michael B. Jordan (Friday Night Lights, The Wire) gives Mr. Grant a fully human presence, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, acknowledging his complexities and contradictions. The film is steady, subtle and seldom moralistic, Mr. Scott wrote, which is what gives it its power. The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty, defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audiences reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry.

The differences in mood are striking. The first book, Invisible City (1988), which Mr. Schles created while living on a drug-ravaged block on Avenue B, reflects the turmoil and death in his life at the time. My friends were dying of AIDS, and I was living in an abandoned building, he said. A quarter of a century later, when he went back to the work, it was as someone who had survived the era, and the images revealed themselves to him in a different light. The resulting book, Night Walk (2014), is the retrospective glance of a father of two living in Fort Greene, in Brooklyn. It is much more about the people and the vitality, he said.

Parker, was given its initial performance at His Majestys Theatre on Thursday evening [Dec. 24], and it proved a rare Christmas Eve treat. Sir Herbert, in the dual role of Micawber and Daniel Peggotty, was never seen to better advantage, and the difficult task of adapting Dickens for the stage was carried out remarkably well. There was a great ovation at the end, and the audience insisted upon a speech from Sir Herbert, who replied with the modesty of a schoolgirl, but with evident gratitude. Judging from the dress rehearsal of the Sleeping Beauty Re-Awakened, at Drury Lane, this pantomime will be a great favorite of the festive season. During one of the intervals, the band played Tipperary, and everyone in the audience joined in with such relish that encore after encore followed. At the Lyceum, Miss Louise Beckman will be the hero of Jack and the Beanstalk, and Miss Doris Dean will be the pretty princess.

This contingent, composed of about two hundred well-trained, sun-browned men from the Antipodes, is the first to reach Britain from any section of the imperial realm of King George VI. The squadron, which was schooled in Australia and is operating four-engine Sunderland flying boats, will be attached to the coastal command in the Royal Air Force after the completion of a course of advanced training at a British air base.

Its easy to see the appeal: Who couldnt use a nudge to re-evaluate their tottering piles of stuff? But Kondos obsessive-compulsive asceticism comes wrapped in a moony New Age haze that recommends, for instance, thanking your shoes for their hard work or communing with your outfits by fondling them. It is very natural for me to say thank you to the goods that support us, Kondo told The Associated Press recently. The inside of a house or apartment after decluttering has much in common with a Shinto shrine, . . . a place where there are no unnecessary things, and our thoughts become clear. Maybe so.

Its no coincidence that one of the most erotic characters in literature, Bram Stokers Dracula, appeared in 1897, toward the end of Queen Victorias reign. (Remember: He had to leave Transylvania and come to England to feast upon pure blood, and open all those untouched . . . necks.)

Its a case of literary jet lag. Youve been with Johnson to secret chambers within the pyramids of Giza and foul trenches in the sewers of old Chicago; youve looked through telescopes on Mauna Kea and peered into microscopes with 19th-century bacteriologists. Youve had to move around space and time to do this, but more crucially, youve had to wander back and forth through passageways that connect technological history with politics, economics and culture. Have you ever wondered why flash photography led to antipoverty programs at the turn of the 20th century? Or how the invention of the laser contributed to the decline of mom-and-pop stores? Of course you havent, because you didnt really stop to think  wait, check that; I didnt really stop to think  how the invention of flash photography finally allowed Jacob Riis to capture the images of dismal tenement life on New Yorks Lower East Side that he had already been writing about, with little impact, for years. Or how the laser begat the bar code that, in turn, gave an efficiency advantage to stores like Target and Walmart. How We Got to Now is full of nifty connections like these  stories that illustrate obscure chains of causality that shaped the modern world. Weve gone from making cave paintings to using slender slabs of powerful technology like the iPhone 6. But its hardly been a linear path. Johnson shows the meandering process by which weve made this journey, and what sort of cultural waves ripple outward as we move ahead. ",2014-12-26T17:51:03+0000

Most of the world considers all settlement construction to be a violation of international law. Israel has established more than a hundred official settlements, but others have sprung up without official approval in recent decades. Amona, which was established in 1997 and is one of the oldest outposts, violated Israeli rules because most of it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. The courts have ordered the partial evacuation of Amona in the past, but action was postponed on various grounds. Michael Sfard, the legal adviser of Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, and one of the lawyers representing the Palestinian landowners, described the ruling as a landmark in the struggle against the theft of Palestinian land in the West Bank.

Philosophies like Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, and possibly Epicureanism (the ancient philosophy, not its modern association with pleasures of the flesh) offer different ways of achieving such a tranquil state, and so they are tempting.

The announcement came on the heels of announcements that the film would not be shown in Morocco and Egypt because of its portrayal of Moses, as well as historical inaccuracies and giving a Zionist view of history. Exodus, produced by 20th Century Fox, was previously criticized for having white actors in the leading roles  including Christian Bale as Moses  despite being set in Egypt. It has had tepid results at the box office, taking in $52.5 million in domestic ticket sales since opening nationwide on Dec. 12, according to Box Office Mojo. Its not the first time Arab countries have banned Hollywood films because of religion: Darren Aronofskys Noah was barred in several countries in the spring, and the animated movie The Prince of Egypt was forbidden in Egypt in 1998.",2014-12-28T22:42:31+0000

But for a replica of that Texas landmark, above, neglect may be the biggest foe. Alamo Village, a 400-acre set built in the late 1950s for John Waynes movie  The Alamo, is slowly losing the battle against time and nature, The Associated Press reported. More than 100 additional productions, including movies and music videos, were filmed at the site, about 120 miles west of the actual Alamo in downtown San Antonio. The set contained more than 200,000 square feet of permanent buildings, including a church, blacksmith shop and a jail, according to the Texas State Historical Association. For several decades it was a popular tourist destination, drawing hundreds of daily visitors at its height for musical shows and staged gunfights. But attendance waned in the 1980s as traffic shifted north after the completion of Interstate 10, The A.P. reported. The set was put up for sale in 2004 by Virginia Shahan, who took over operations after the death in 1996 of James T. Shahan, her husband and founder of Alamo Village. It was eventually closed in 2010, about a year after Ms. Shahan died. The site is now mostly used for cattle grazing and hunting, and some buildings are beginning to succumb to the elements, The A.P. reported. David Jones, a businessman in Corpus Christi, Tex., hopes to bring tourists back to Alamo Village. He told The A.P. he is close to raising the $8 million he estimates is needed to buy the property and turn it into a Texas version of Old Tucson, a theme park in Arizona.",2014-12-28T22:45:45+0000

After that sale, through Christies in July, the association barred the Northampton council from its membership, and Arts Council England revoked the accreditations of the Northampton museum as well as the Abington Park Museum, also run by the borough council, for five years. The Museums Association is further tightening its ethics code to help stem sell-offs of valuable antiquities from collections run by financially struggling institutions, and it is in talks with Arts Council England, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Art Fund to establish a joint response to such sales.

Still, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, "" not as good as E.T. is not so bad. The film, directed by the Spielberg admirer J. J. Abrams, is about a group of young teenagers (including Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee, Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) in 1979 who are filming a low-budget zombie movie when they witness a violent train derailment. They cant see much in the chaos of the crash, but its possible that their camera saw more. While they wait for the film to be developed, strange things begin happening in their town. Dogs and people disappear, electronics go missing, and the streets fill with soldiers. Mr. Abrams, Mr. Scott wrote, captures his protagonists and their era with a sense of period detail that sits right on the line between uncanny and neurotic. He added: His 1979 is more like 1979 than the real 1979, which hardly seemed like a time of innocence and eager wonder. But no time ever does, except in retrospect.",2014-12-30T05:31:03+0000

The organizations executive directors, Hugo Martinez, a gallery owner, and Dr. Juan Tapia, a pediatrician, worked with Kaptein Roodnat, a Dutch architectural studio, on the $2.4 million renovation, whose design alludes to a town square and streets: the natural habitat of graffiti. (All city is the phrase graffiti artists use when they have painted all five boroughs of New York, including the rooftops, Mr. Martinez said.) The waiting area, above, includes gray cushions wrapped in colorful canvas straps. If visitors dont want to sit upright, they can sit any way they like, said Marleen Kaptein, one of the architects. The first show, Free Radicals, is up through March. Framed art sells for $250 to $8,000; cotton-blend rugs start at $1,200. 3332 Broadway (West 135th Street).
