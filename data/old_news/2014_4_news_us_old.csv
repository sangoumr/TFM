The information will include data on the $77 billion paid by Medicare in 2012 to more than 880,000 health care professionals for 6,000 types of services and procedures. Patient information will remain private. Data like these can shine a light on how care is delivered in the Medicare program, said Jonathan Blum, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a blog post. They can help consumers compare the services provided and payments received by individual health care providers. Businesses and consumers alike can use these data to drive decision-making and reward quality, cost-effective care. Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly, was prevented from releasing information on individual physicians until a ruling last year by a federal judge in Florida. In a statement issued by the A.M.A., the medical group raised concerns that Medicares broad release of the payment information could mislead the public and recommended that doctors be allowed to review and correct any information before it was made public.

Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that this very long, very busy Disney movie, directed by Gore Verbinski and produced with Jerry Bruckheimer, will unite the generations in bafflement, stupefaction and occasional delight, noting that it tries to do for the post-Civil War frontier what the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise did for the high seas in the Age of Sail, turning history (including the history of movies) into a hyperactive, multipurpose amusement machine.

And with a first chapter that begins, Milla, or what was left of her, was found by Simen and two of his friends when they were digging for buried treasure in the woods, it hardly seeks to maintain suspense about the identity or fate of the victim. Yet the novel  Ullmanns fifth, translated from Norwegian by Barbara J. Haveland  is steeped in dread the way a fruitcake is steeped in rum: Every page, every line, seems to glisten with vapors of sumptuous, intoxicating unease.",2014-04-04T15:04:59+0000

us,Inside the List,"Triple Threat: Its tempting to be cynical, I know, when you come across another book by a rich and powerful person avowing that power and riches are, like, totally overrated and happiness is all that matters. And when that rich and powerful person is Arianna Huffington  whose media empire, The Huffington Post, is famous among other things for encouraging writers to work without pay  well, cynicism becomes downright unavoidable. (At least her message is consistent: Why pay contributors if money corrupts?) Huffingtons new book, Thrive, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 1, arguing that our obsession with wealth and status obscures the importance of mental well-being as the third metric of success. Basically, its a technocratic version of the old work-life equation, swathed in New Age incense: Our breath, Huffington declares early on, also has a sacredness about it. None of this means the book doesnt make good points along the way, advising readers to sleep longer, take more walks and disengage every now and then from the digital world  including, presumably, from The Huffington Post. When Huffington appeared on The Daily Show recently, Jon Stewart seemed unsure what to make of her new persona.

Leon tends to console herself by writing a new book. BY ITS COVER (Atlantic Monthly, $26), which finds the author in a fury over vandalism and theft in national libraries, museums and churches, appears to have been inspired by the looting of Napless Girolamini Library by its director, a systematic sacking of thousands of rare books that came to light in 2012. (It would make a stone weep, according to one of Brunettis colleagues.) Although the criminal damage done at the venerable Biblioteca Merula is on a far more modest scale, its no less heartbreaking to the library director, as well as to the commissario. Its also a great mystery. How was the damage done when the only patrons of this obscure library are innocuous scholars like Joseph Nickerson, an American academic researching maritime and Mediterranean trade history, and an ex-priest affectionately known as Tertullian for his obsessive study of the writings of the Church Fathers?

Before airlines made that color standard for their flight recorders, some Boeings used a yellow sphere, and the British had a gizmo called the Red Egg. So why do they call it black? One explanation goes this way: In 1939, an aviation engineer named Franois Hussenot devised a means of capturing an aircrafts history to a box of photographic film. Onboard sensors flashed into the box through calibrated mirrors and traced a running tab of flight parameters, including altitude, air speed and the position of the cockpit controls. Because the device worked like a camera, its insides had to be in total darkness; thus, perhaps, the black""-ness of the box.",2014-04-04T15:15:27+0000

The captors claimed to have executed one of the border guards. Irans government-run Press TV website quoted Esmail Kosari, deputy chairman of a parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, as saying that the other four had been handed over to Iranian officials in Pakistan. It was not immediately clear why they had been released, and there was no confirmation from Pakistans government. The abductions on Feb. 6 caused deep strains in relations between Iran and Pakistan, and the Iranians had threatened to send troops into Pakistani territory to rescue the captives. The border area, in Sistan-Baluchistan Province in southeastern Iran, is a hotbed of Sunni militant resistance to Irans Shiite authorities. In October, Iran executed 16 Sunni insurgents in retaliation for an attack by armed men who crossed the border from Pakistan and killed 14 Iranian border guards near the city of Saravan.

At once frantically overblown and beautifully filigreed, Man of Steel will turn on everyone it doesnt turn off, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. If you wave away all the computer-generated smoke and see past the pulverized buildings, its possible to remain hooked on the resonant origin story that wends through Man of Steel  that of the immigrant.

But while Pettibon examines the trappings of surf culture in the paintings, the artist  who despite living in Venice Beach, Calif., has never ridden the waves himself  is also dealing with universal truths. These works are about the solitary surfer against the vast ocean, man against nature. You get a sense that nature is going to swallow him up, Lindemann notes.

Theres a whiff of playful humor to the designs, underscored by the fact that Chu also sells conical party hats, made with the same premium leather and high-end stitching as the bags.

Based on early returns, four television networks forecast a victory for the Liberal Party. The results are likely to be viewed as a severe rebuke of the movement for Quebec independence. Before the election, the Parti Qubcois played down the likelihood that it would seek a third referendum on separation if re-elected. For years, polls have shown that a firm majority of Quebeckers oppose leaving Canada. Yet the partys attempt to avoid the issue, which was the basis of its founding, fell apart last month when its star candidate, Pierre Karl Pladeau, a media magnate, immediately vowed to make Quebec a nation in a rousing speech that concluded with a raised fist.

Legend has it that when Cassina first saw Magistrettis prototype for the now-iconic 1974 Maralunga sofa, he disliked it so much that he punched it  hard. His frustration split the back of the model, which fell back over itself so that it resembled a headrest. This serendipitous series of events eventually resulted in the design for the Maralunga, the first upholstered sofa to incorporate movement  the back transforms into an actual headrest  for ultimate comfort. To mark the 40th anniversary of its bestseller, the company collaborated again with design visionaries to develop a new version of the sofa, this time tapping 20 students from the Swiss art and design school ECAL for the task. Just in time for Milans annual design week, Salone Internazionale del Mobile, the results are on view at the Cassina showroom in the city beginning tomorrow.",2014-04-08T04:00:00+0000

(Starz) AMOUR (2012) An elderly French couple, portrayed by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, above, find their love tested when she has a stroke and he becomes her caretaker in this Oscar winner for best foreign-language film, directed by Michael Haneke. Isabelle Huppert plays their self-centered daughter  like her parents, a musician  whose questions about what she can do to help as her mother becomes increasingly incapacitated ring hollow. Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called this film a masterpiece about life, death and everything in between. And while some viewers may find the movie cold and even cruel, she added, theres another point to be made here, namely that all the violence in Amour is crucial to Mr. Hanekes rigorous, liberatingly unsentimental worldview, one that gazes on death with the same benevolent equanimity as life. All of which is to say: Bring hankies. This is a film that will make you weep not only because life ends but also because it blooms. ",2014-04-09T05:00:01+0000

The Dutch garden designer from Hummelo, the Netherlands, has risen to international acclaim thanks to the many private and public parks he worked on, including the High Line in Manhattan, the Lurie Garden in Chicagos Millennium Park and Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, which was home to the 2012 Olympic Games and just opened to the public last week. These projects bring the quality of home gardening to public spaces, creating organic environments that feel as though theyve been growing there, on their own, for years. For his latest undertaking, Oudolf is designing the grounds of the new outpost of Hauser & Wirth gallery, a remodeled 18th-century farmhouse in the rolling hills of the English county of Somerset that is set to open in July. This film, produced by the filmmaker Thomas Piper and Checkerboard Film Foundation, will offer an intimate view of Oudolfs process, from landscape blueprints to theories on beauty, when it hits the big screen toward the middle of next year.",2014-04-09T17:10:57+0000

The inspector general, Gregory H. Friedman, issued a management alert that was a veiled slap at a former chairman of the commission, Jon Wellinghoff, who has been arguing that an attack last year on a California substation was an act of terrorism, a conclusion that the F.B.I. and local law enforcement officials have refused to endorse. Mr. Friedman said that the commission staff had created a presentation that should have been classified and protected from release. The commission generated a memo, later described by The Wall Street Journal, that said that simultaneous attacks on a handful of substations around the country could cripple the power grid. The inspector general said he was acting after a complaint from the Energy Departments ethics officer and letters from the chairwoman and ranking minority member of the Senate Energy Committee. He recommended establishing a classification system, a step he said the current chairwoman of the commission had promised to implement promptly. ",2014-04-10T02:48:24+0000

For one thing, he was older than the others and the first to emigrate from Europe to America. For another, he was less autocratic. Laemmle, an elfin man, was informal, unpretentious and cheery. Everyone, including his own son, called him Uncle Carl, and, according to one witness, he would roam the lot at Universal City with a pail in which he would urinate when he felt the urge. Most of the others made a point of declaiming their American-ness. Laemmle kept close ties to his native Germany  he visited Europe each year  and called the country his fatherland.

Their predecessors didnt have that luxury, but their recollections are being captured by programs like PBSs Pioneers of Television, which begins a new season on Tuesday (check local listings) with a particularly entertaining episode, Standup to Sitcom.

These stars made it look easy, but its a challenge. The difference between the stand-up and the sitcom is youre going from the least collaborative medium there is to the most collaborative, Mr. Seinfeld says. The reason you become a comedian is youre not a good collaborator, youre not good with people, youre not good in social situations or professional situations. ",2014-04-11T21:14:59+0000

Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave who assists his master. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film, which also earned Mr. Tarantino an Oscar for best original screenplay, crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness. He added: Mr. Tarantino is a virtuoso of bloodshed, that is for sure, and also more enamored of a particularly toxic racial slur than any decent white man should be. But decency in the conventional sense is not his concern, though in another sense it very much is. When you wipe away the blood and the anarchic humor, what you see in Django Unchained is moral disgust with slavery, instinctive sympathy for the underdog and an affirmation (in the relationship between Django and Schultz) of what used to be called brotherhood.",2014-04-12T05:00:01+0000

Rio 2 (20th Century Fox), an animated avian musical, was close behind with a solid $39 million, on par with the opening-weekend total for its series predecessor. But analysts and Fox, which backed Rio 2 with a sizzling social media marketing campaign, had been predicting slightly higher totals.

(13) THE TRIALS OF MUHAMMAD ALI (2013) In 1967  after changing his name from Cassius Clay, joining the Nation of Islam and refusing to be inducted into the United States military because of his religious opposition to the Vietnam War  Muhammad Ali, above, was convicted of draft evasion. Stripped of his world heavyweight championship and banned from boxing, he spent the next four years fighting legal battles. In 1971, his case for being a conscientious objector reached the United States Supreme Court. In this Independent Lens presentation, the director Bill Siegel combines interviews with Louis Farrakhan; Mr. Alis second wife, Khalilah Camacho-Ali; the journalist Robert Lipsyte; Mr. Alis loyal brother, Rahman; and a clerk from the Supreme Court proceedings to address Mr. Alis challenges then and now, including his battle with Parkinsons. The film falls short of explaining Mr. Ali, who, like many outspoken individuals, can stubbornly repel scrutiny, nor will it pacify the many who opposed his conscientious objections, Nicolas Rapold wrote in The New York Times.

The first time I saw the recipe I wanted to test it right away, but I didnt have Asian pears. So I used an apple, and loved it. Its the sweet, crunchy fruit that does the trick, and apples and Asian pears both work. There are onions in the original recipe but Ive made them optional.",2014-04-14T14:43:51+0000

Roasting the tomatillos, chiles and garlic  toasting really, as I use a skillet for this, on top of the flame  produces a salsa with a delicious charred flavor. I learned something recently from the chef Iliana de la Vega, who demonstrated the recipe at the Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives conference in Napa Valley in March: she says, in no uncertain terms, that you should not add water to tomatillo salsas. Without the water, this is a more intense salsa with pleasing density. You can use it as a sauce to serve with chicken or fish, or as a dip with chips or other vegetables.",2014-04-14T14:45:14+0000

The insect, famed for its remarkable annual migrations, faced declines in habitat on both the Mexican and American ends of its range for decades, but now is the focus of an urgent push for a rescue. The latest step is a letter sent on Monday to President Obama and relevant cabinet members by a group of scientists, educators, farmers, and other concerned citizens organized by the Xerces Society and other conservation groups focused on these butterflies. The letter (read it here) describes policies the administration could pursue on both public and private land along the butterflys migratory path. In February, after about 20 naturalists, poets and other monarch defenders pressed for international action in an open letter, the plight of the butterfly was addressed by President Obama and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts ata summit. The leaders agreed to create a working group to study ways to protect the butterfly at both ends of its range. A recent article by Richard Conniff in Yale Environment 360 describes what farmers can do to help monarchs.

Using preliminary police data, researchers identified a homicide decrease of about 16 percent, with some of the biggest drops in murders in Ciudad Jurez and Monterrey, notoriously dangerous cities that have recently calmed down as the war between criminal gangs and the government has declined in intensity. Still, experts warn, it is not clear whether the decline is attributable to an overall weakening of organized crime: The number of gun-related murders has held steady as other kinds of killing have declined, and homicides have sharply risen in states farther south. Extortion and kidnapping have also increased nationwide. But with overall murder rates down for the second year in a row from their 2011 peak, some parts of Mexico appear to be on the mend, said David A. Shirk, an author of the report. The decrease in violence that the government in Mexico is trying to convince people of is in fact real, he said. ",2014-04-15T00:50:11+0000

And they should know: Ficaro has styled props and interiors for Bon Apptit, Town & Country, Elle, Harpers Bazaar and Domino, while Nickey co-owns a successful design company in L.A. Rather than choosing homes simply because they struck their fancy, the co-authors first rounded up a trove of creative types  artists, writers, musicians, stylists, art directors  who had interesting personal style, and then hoped their homes would follow suit. Their instincts proved correct, and the 17 nests featured in this beautiful coffee-table book, shot by the Danish photographer Ditte Isager, reveal the inspiring combination of natural light and accidental, lived-in beauty. And despite the authors professions, Ficaro and Nickey opted not to style or decorate any of the interiors before they were photographed.

A thread of whimsy runs through the work of the New York-born, Amsterdam-based designer, whose handcrafted pieces have been collected by the likes of Kanye West and Sienna Miller. Though she started her line in 2006, her work is gaining new attention this season; it recently debuted at Bergdorf Goodman and Dover Street Market in New York and will launch on Net-a-Porter on June 9th. Her spring collection, carved from 40,000-year-old mammoth tusks that emerged from the Russian tundra thanks to global warming, includes such designs as a pendant depicting a cloud raining thunderbolts, a necklace strung with dodo egg-shaped pearls and a wraparound dragon ring that features a tiny man clutching a diamond emerging from the jaws of the beast. The natural world is a leitmotif for van der Velden, who likes to tell the story of how an owl once soared through the room at one of her runway shows. For fall, her pieces will incorporate actual scarab wings. I am fascinated by nature and its beauty, she says. I hate to see such beauty go to waste.",2014-04-17T14:00:04+0000

us,Turkey: Intelligence Bill Approved," Turkeys Parliament on Thursday passed a bill that increases the powers of the national spy agency and strengthens its immunity, a move that critics said would allow Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to bolster his control over state institutions. The measure, which requires presidential approval before it becomes a law, would give the National Intelligence Organization, known by the initials of its Turkish name M.I.T., access to information collected by public and private institutions without a court order and would expand its ability to carry out covert operations. Government officials said the changes would make the agency more efficient and provide protections for its personnel. Mr. Erdogan has been tightening his grip on state agencies as his government deals with accusations of corruption and has tried to block or control access to the Internet, Twitter and YouTube. With this legislation, the M.I.T. is no longer a national intelligence agency but has become the prime ministers intelligence agency, said an opposition lawmaker, Sezgin Tanrikulu.

He bought a piece of calfs liver and put it in a lab oven at about 120 degrees for a few days to approximate mummification.

It excludes the period shortly afterward when Russia annexed Crimea. It was not immediately clear whom Ukraine was accusing of the deaths. Initially, Parliament sought to single out the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, but other groups may also be included. Because Ukraine is not a member of the court, it has formally given it jurisdiction with respect to the period in question. That step, which was apparently taken in early April, was announced in a court statement issued late Thursday. Ukraines application said it expected that the court shall duly study the case. But a court spokesman emphasized that it would be up to a prosecutor to decide whether to proceed, and then the courts judges would be asked to approve the decision. An investigation is not expected any time soon. ",2014-04-19T00:22:12+0000

The result of the ingress of tourists was that the boulevards and main streets of Paris presented an even more cosmopolitan appearance than usual. Fortunately fine weather favored the sightseers and the guides reaped a rich silver harvest. Groups of energetic Teutons made an almost military inspection of the Louvre and decided with unanimity that the Mona Lisas smile is as over-rated as it is ambiguous.The char--bancs were all crowded, the majority of the passengers wearing caps. At dusk a group of English tourists, who had probably crossed the Channel for the sake of higher mental culture, marched contentedly up the avenue de lOpra to the immortal strains of You made me love you, supplied by the youngest visitors richly toned mouth-organ. The Frenchmen who had remained in Paris gazed upon their progress with unspeakable admiration and drank a thoughtful aperitif to the eternal durability of the Entente Cordiale.

Youve got to admit that its perversely entertaining, Neil Genzlinger wrote in The New York Times. Though witchery is a favorite theme of shows aimed at teenagers, this series aspires to a grown-up audience. You can tell that from the sex and nudity (the somewhat demure basic-cable variety, but still, theres a lot of flesh here). More important, you can tell it from the writing. When Salem isnt being deliberately outrageous, its cultivating a dynamic that could be fruitful as things move along.

(FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three story lines, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon, above), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, a solemn boy named Marcus feels the presence of his twin, Jason, whose violent death has left him adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Ccile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, is convinced that she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this film, written by Peter Morgan. He added: What does seem new  newly strange, newly beautiful  is what Hereafter makes of the here and now.

This dough, adapted from Jacquy Pfeiffers recipe for pte brise in The Art of French Pastry, involves more butter than youre used to seeing in my recipes, but an occasional butter-based crust, especially when its made with whole-wheat flour and contains a filling that is all about vegetables, is not going to kill us.

He was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement, something the defense lawyers said improperly made him an informant. The disclosure derailed a week of pretrial hearings, and the special trial counsel, Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, an assistant United States attorney, is leading an investigation into the matter. It was widely speculated that the subject of the F.B.I. inquiry was how the 36-page manuscript by Mr. Mohammed  the self-described architect of the attacks  had been leaked. But in a public court filing on Monday, Mr. Campoamor-Sanchez said that was not true.

The naturalist John Muir and the forester Gifford Pinchot waged war in the early 1900s over the flooding of the magnificent Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Decades later, the proposed damming of the Colorado River prompted public outrage, and the environmental movement was born. Today some two million organizations worldwide work on behalf of social justice and the environment. In this Earth Day tribute, American Masters chronicles issues (pollution, whaling, conservation of the Amazon rain forest, climate change) within the fight and the players who made a difference (Lois Gibbs, who rallied on behalf of Love Canal; David Brower, above, the first executive director of the Sierra Club; and Paul Watson and Rex Weyler, the founders of Greenpeace). The environmental movement is about nature versus humanity, says Robert Redford, who with Meryl Streep, Ashley Judd, Van Jones and Isabel Allende narrates this documentary, directed by Mark Kitchell.

But incomes for the middle class and poor in the United States have since been growing more slowly than elsewhere. Why? Among the reasons: This country has lost its once-wide lead in educational attainment. Other countries have increased their workers skill levels more quickly, helping create well-paying jobs. The United States also tolerates more inequality: The minimum wage is lower here. Executives make more money. The government redistributes less of it. By 2010, the poor in several other countries had pulled ahead. And Canadas median income had reached a virtual tie with that of the United States.

The defendants, Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles, who have not been permitted to leave Qatar, are appealing their three-year sentence, which was announced on March 27. But until Tuesday, their lawyers were unsure how to proceed with the appeal because the judges had never explained the reduced charge. Prosecutors had accused the Huangs of starving their daughter, Gloria, 8, and originally suspected them of being child traffickers because the defendants are of Asian heritage and the child was African. The Huangs, who attributed the childs death to an eating disorder, said the prosecution was based on flawed evidence, racial prejudices and misunderstandings about Western adoption.

Local news media reported that the deaths occurred in the slum, or favela, called Pavo-Pavozinho. The disturbances began after a young man who was a dancer on a television variety show was found dead and residents charged that he had been killed by a police officer, according to the reports. The police said that they were investigating, but that marks on the mans body indicated that he could have fallen to his death. A protest turned violent, and several officers became trapped in the favela. An elite squad then arrived. Copacabana residents reported hearing gunshots and what sounded like small explosions. A second man was later found fatally shot. Separately, a police officer was shot in another favela in the north of the city.

(Starz Cinema) CHICKEN WITH PLUMS (2012) A celebrated but tormented violinist, Nasser-Ali (Mathieu Amalric, above), in 1958 Tehran retreats to his bed to end his life after his prized instrument is broken, in this drama from Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, based on Ms. Satrapis graphic novel of the same title. But in flashbacks  and flash-forwards  starring Nasser-Alis wife (Maria de Medeiros) and children (Mathis Bour and Enna Balland; Chiara Mastroianni and Christian Friedel portray them as adults), it soon becomes clear that his melancholy is rooted in a deeper heartache: his long-ago love, Irane (Golshifteh Farahani). Not that Chicken With Plums is gloomy, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Like its swooning, madly melodramatic musical score (by Olivier Bernet), the film takes an almost giddy pleasure in unhappiness, turning even pedestrian moments of boredom or discomfort into occasions for wild invention. The result, which features a naked Sophia Loren and Edouard Baer as the Angel of Death, is captivating, but not exactly moving. ",2014-04-23T04:18:00+0000

us,Whats on Friday,"9 P.M. (13) MATTHEW BOURNES SLEEPING BEAUTY In 1992, Mr. Bourne, the British choreographer, reinterpreted The Nutcracker, the first of three classic ballets set to scores by Tchaikovsky; in 1995, he unveiled his setting for Swan Lake. He completes the endeavor with this reimagining of the fairy tale about a princess who sleeps under a spell for 100 years, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa in 1890. Mr. Bournes version, taped at the Bristol Hippodrome in England, begins in that year with the birth of the heroine, Aurora (danced by Hannah Vassallo, above center, with Edwin Ray, left and Danny Reubens), who falls in love not with a prince but a gardener, Leo (Dominic North), and eventually awakens in the modern day. He also provides Leo with a rival, Caradoc (Adam Maskell), the dashingly vengeful son of the evil fairy who curses Aurora to death. The love story that Mr. Bourne substitutes isnt any more emotionally compelling than the original, Brian Seibert wrote in his review of the production, presented here by Great Performances, in The New York Times. Poetically, its a diminishment. The battle between good and evil is reduced to a tussle between the nice guy and the bad boy. Still, he said, Mr. Bourne is not an ungrateful recipient of the gift of Tchaikovskys score. He dedicates his Sleeping Beauty to the composer, whose work will survive this version. Its more than 100 years old and still likely to last as long as the undead. ",2014-04-25T05:00:01+0000

One of these urbane aspiring writers was 24-year-old Peter Matthiessen, fresh out of Yale and wrestling with his first novel, who, along with George Plimpton, William Styron, Harold Humes, Thomas Guinzburg and a few other hard-partying expats, would go on to start The Paris Review in 1953.

In life, Boyd retains the spirit of a youthful rebel, with her pierced tongue and name spelled in anti-Establishment lowercase.

While he acquitted Gandhi, he might have been harder on Cesar Chavez, the great farmworker leader. Certainly in this engrossing biography Miriam Pawel, a former editor and reporter with Newsday and The Los Angeles Times, is out to show both the good and bad. In the 1960s and early 70s, Chavez did seem like a version of Gandhi. Organizing the dispossessed, our own untouchables, he fasted to the point of death, staged mass marches up and down California that resembled religious pilgrimages, and defeated growers with nationwide boycotts that even Gandhi would have found hard to duplicate. Back then, many of the best and saintliest of Americas young quit their jobs or dropped out of school to join up with Chavez and live lives of voluntary poverty. ",2014-04-25T15:16:18+0000

Fikry  new at No. 15 on the hardcover fiction list  is a cranky bookstore owner, depressed after the death of his wife and the theft of a prized volume, who gradually perks up while caring for a baby abandoned in his shop. Book buyers, it turns out, like to read about booksellers. In the past few years, other best-selling examples include The Marriage Bargain, by Jennifer Probst (a billionaire proposes to a bookstore owner), Murder of a Bookstore Babe, by Denise Swanson (death by shelving), and Mr. Penumbras 24-Hour Bookstore, by Robin Sloan (a web designer finds a night job at a mysterious shop). Yet Zevin recently told readers of The National Post in Canada that as appealing as the idea of running a bookstore is in theory, in reality shes just not interested. I think this is the pet pipe dream of many of us who love books, she said. I sometimes like to imagine the kind of bookstore I would run. I have, for instance, a deeply impractical idea for a performance art space/minimalist bookstore. The bookstore would only sell one title a month, and there would be a play or art installation of some kind based around that book. However, this is all just fantasy. Running a bookstore is ridiculously difficult, and the challenges bookstores face  e-books, online competition  are enormous. I suspect the closest Ill ever come to owning a bookstore is having written The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry. ",2014-04-25T15:31:45+0000

They will make their request at their first hearing, scheduled for Monday, the lawyers said.

Everybody on our team was scratching their heads, said Randy Papetti, one of the lawyers. This is simply out of left field. The Huang case has come to symbolize what critics call the arbitrary system of criminal justice in Qatar, where foreign workers constitute a majority of the population.

His book, as the title suggests, is notable among recent treatments of inequality for its elevation of wealth and capital (as opposed to just income), and particularly for its discussion of the re-emergence of inheritance as a force for class stratification in the West. The books frequent references to 19th century fiction notwithstanding, Piketty concedes that there are likely to be fewer extraordinarily large estates (relative to the wealth of society as a whole) in 21st century Europe and America than there were in, say, his native France two hundred years ago. But he argues that there will be, and indeed already are, enough large-ishestates to return us to a state of affairs where wealth is channeled through patrimonies to a remarkable, quasi-Victorian extent:",2014-04-26T00:05:11+0000

(Starz Cinema) A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP (2010) In this faithful remake of Joel and Ethan Coens Blood Simple (1984), the director Zhang Yimou moves the action from modern-day Texas to a desolate valley in northwest China in the feudal past, above, where the wife (Yan Ni) of a rich and sexually sadistic noodle-shop owner, Wang (Ni Dahong), is carrying on with one of his employees (Xiao Shenyang). Then Zhang (Sun Honglei), a detective hired by Wang to kill the adulterous couple, arrives on the scene, and all hell breaks loose. Though it begins with some exaggerated, almost clownish business and includes a handful of clean and mordant sight gags, A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop has a gravity that is surprising, given that it is basically the pastiche of a pastiche, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But by working through the self-conscious genre imitation that was something of a novelty in Blood Simple, Mr. Zhang uncovers the primal, mythic intensity of the story and also changes the tone of its essential nihilism. The Coens posit a universe without order or meaning, and while Mr. Zhang does not necessarily quarrel with this view, he treats it less as a cosmic joke than as a grim folk tale.

The idea is to expedite the process of getting at least some comments posted, which also lowers the overall number of comments that need moderation in advance.Some dont like it. Michael Simmons, for one, calls it unfair and wrong. In a comment on my recent Sunday column, he wrote: This has created a hierarchy of commenters wherein the same handful of readers have their comments posted before everyone else  sometimes many hours before everyone else can be vetted.

The boat was scheduled to sail in June from Gaza to European ports carrying Palestinian goods for export. Attempts to breach the blockade have usually involved boats trying to sail to Gaza.

The move, announced on Tuesday by the Treasury, State and Justice Departments, also offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Mr. Lis arrest or conviction. Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, told reporters in Beijing that China resolutely opposes the U.S. citing domestic laws to unilaterally impose sanctions on Chinese companies or individuals. He said the American move will not help resolve the issue and will harm bilateral cooperation on nonproliferation. It was unclear whether Chinas anger would have an impact on the effectiveness of the American-led sanctions against Iran, which are mostly a response to the Iranian nuclear program. China and the United States are both in the group of big powers negotiating with Iran over its nuclear activities, seeking guarantees that the Iranians will not develop nuclear weapons.
