Thanks to its debate coverage and heavy focus on the presidential primaries, CNNs ratings in prime time for viewers 25 to 54 were up 90 percent, to an average of 453,000 for the first quarter of 2008.

Among total viewers in prime time, Fox maintained its leadership position in the first quarter with an average of 1.8 million viewers, up 14 percent from last year.

He was here for a book party and media tour.

PEN supports freedom of speech and freedom of expression on the most basic level, she said. Writers should be able to enter our country regardless of what theyve written. Mr. Horsley, in a telephone interview from London, said he would absolutely accept PENs invitation if American authorities would let him into the country. The pen is mightier than the sword, he said.

For many years the image was attributed to William Henry Fox Talbot, one of the fathers of photography, and was thought to have been made in 1839. But Larry J. Schaaf, an expert on Talbots work, questioned that attribution in an essay in the catalog for the photography auction, which will still be held on Monday but without the leaf image, above. Mr. Schaaf wrote that there is evidence to suggest that the work titled Leaf  made by placing a leaf on photosensitive paper exposed to light  could have been created by the early photographic experimenters Thomas Wedgwood, James Watt or Humphry Davy. They are known to have produced photogenic drawings, also called photograms, as early as the 1790s, though no examples have ever been found. Denise Bethel, director of Sothebys photograph department, said the auction house and the images owner, an investment firm called the Quillan Company, had decided to postpone the sale of the print indefinitely until more research could be done.",2008-04-03T04:00:00+0000

Daisy, a 2007 launch that the perfumer Alberto Morillas crafted under the creative direction of Marc Jacobs and Cotys vice president of marketing, Michael DArminio, is almost mesmerizing in its violent resistance to being mesmerizing. A perfume built to play a specific role? Then emphatically yes. Floral without flowers, sweet without sugar, somehow a pretty face without allowing a single feature of that face ever to come into distinct focus. (The only distinct aspect here is its demographic appeal: the perfume skews young.) It seems to have a peculiar engineering that allows it to melt into any background, to speak with a female voice emanating from invisible speakers somewhere over your head, to travel under any door like smoke and occupy, comfortably if spectrally, any space.

For all their accomplishments, though, what neither of these men could claim was any service as an elected executive  that is, as mayor or governor or vice president or president. I mention this only because in the 100 years since, at least as far as I can tell (though perhaps one of you history buffs can prove me wrong), America has never faced a choice between two candidates who lacked any previous executive experience.

The remark was made early in Father Hesburghs 35-year tenure as president, which began in 1952; it was not made in 1987 (The Times reported the remark in an article that year).

us,Welcome to Up To The Moment," By Armand Limnander Its hard to bring a fresh perspective to photographic portraiture, but Paul Mpagi Sepuya proves that sometimes the simplest approach yields the most rewarding results. His book, Beloved Object & Amorous Subject, Revisited (Envoy), is straightforward enough: a series of shirtless young men  Sepuyas friends, boyfriends and collaborators  pose deadpan against a plain white wall in his bedroom. These images are technically impeccable, almost ritualistic in their repetition, and they offer a voyeuristic frisson. But it is the subtle changes in mood and expression that draw us in: who exactly are these guys, and why do we care? The books title was inspired by Roland Barthes A Lovers Discourse: Fragments, his 1977 impressionistic treatise on desire.

For me, I was born in France after the war; I was in the milieu of Structuralist thinkers. If I dont have a good analysis of something, I am lost. Once Nouvel examines his given conditions and decides that the best architectural solution is, say, a skyscraper without visible base and summit, or a mechanized geometric facade that casts filigreed shadows, he can get going. But to this cerebral process he appends a counterweight: the sensuous love of the material components of a building. What I like is the potique of the situation, he said, in Gallically accented English. I am a hedonist, and I want to give pleasure to other people. That avowal of hedonism gained credibility from the surroundings in which it was made: Le Duc, arguably the best seafood restaurant in Paris, where the waiter knew without instruction to bring Nouvels standard order of marinated raw fish followed by poached lobster dressed with olive oil.",2008-04-06T04:00:00+0000

True, Kesey had returned to the United States by the time I dropped out in '67, but Neal Cassady and friends were well established in this town of expatriate artists and potheads. Neal was the featured guest at most parties, entertaining us all with his perpetual-motion silver hammer act and dazzling us with his washboard abs.

The first Mass of the season was held on Sunday. The service is attended by stadium employees, police officers, reporters and, sometimes, visiting players and team executives. I have seen Brian Cashman, the general manager of the Yankees, there.Bob Sheppard, the Yankees public address announcer since 1951, often does the Scripture readings, which, on its own, is a reason to attend the Mass. Sheppard is still recuperating, but there was an announcement made during the service about how he hopes to return by June.The Mass is quick because most attendees are working, but, for those whose Sundays feel vacant without a spiritual experience, it is enjoyable. A half hour after the Mass was over, the makeshift altar was gone and Girardi was doing his pregame news conference.The next Mass at the Stadium will be much different.

The problem is that in 1985, according to The Bay City Times, Madonna was considered for the honor but some people thought then that her entertainment was too risqu. To make matters worse, the newspaper reported, the city refused to accept a sculpture of Madonna from an Italian artist in the late 1980s on the grounds that her popularity would fade. Now Mayor Brunner has written to Madonna to offer her the key, saying, We have always been proud of your accomplishments, but recently your induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame reminded us that we need to honor you with the highest honor that Bay City can offer.

Some have been flattering and some derogatory, but none have been as potentially costly as what her own estate has called her: a New Yorker. Judge Margaret Morrow of Federal District Court in Los Angeles has ruled that because Marilyn Monroe LLC had argued to California tax authorities that the actress was a New York resident, Monroe could not have been a Californian when she died. As so Monroe becomes subject to legislation in New York, where her rights of publicity ended with her death in 1962, rather than in California, where her rights of publicity continue after death and can be bequeathed. The decision makes it possible to reproduce Monroes image without having to pay licensing fees worth millions of dollars to her estate. Marilyn Monroe LLC lacks standing to assert any right of publicity in Marilyn Monroe, said  Surjit Soni, a lawyer representing families of photographers who own images of Monroe.

Pennsylvania shipped $9.2 billion worth of export merchandise to Canada in 2007  32 percent of the state total  and $2.2 billion of goods to Mexico, according to the International Trade Administration. Pennsylvanias exports to Mexico rose 81 percent from 1993 to 2003 and exports to Canada rose 61 percent. The trade association notes that export-supported jobs linked to manufacturing account for an estimated 4.3 percent of Pennsylvania's total private-sector employment. Nearly one-sixth (16.5 percent) of all manufacturing workers in Pennsylvania depend on exports for their jobs.  At the national level, Canada accounted for nearly 16 percent of all U.S. imports of merchandise last year, but also 22 percent of American exports. Mexico accounted for 11 percent of U.S. imports, but 14 percent of U.S. exports. Oil and gas accounts for over 16 percent of American imports from Mexico and (including electricity) nearly 26 percent of our imports from Canada. The dollars we spend on Canadian and Mexican imports are mainly used to buy U.S. exports  mostly goods, but also investments and services provided by such Pennsylvania giants as Vanguard, Cigna, Mellon and PNC Bank.  For all the talk about lost jobs, theyre hard to find in the data. The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania was 6.9 percent in September 1993 when Nafta was enacted, and it is 4.9 percent today. Nonfarm payrolls have grown by 682,500 since then, or 13.3 percent.   Technology (computers and robots) has long been shrinking assembly-line manufacturing jobs in virtually every nation. If we exported manufacturing jobs, it must have been to the moon. A 2006 Banco de Mexico study worries that in recent years employment in (Mexican) industry has been decreasing whereas the employment in the service sector has been increasing. Even China eliminated 10 million manufacturing jobs from 1991 to 2003, according to the Asian Development Bank.   Some U.S. jobs are lost every year, even as more jobs are added, because some businesses shrink or fail. Critics of Nafta toss out anecdotal examples of job losses, which they loosely blame on import competition, rather than on competition from other states. For example, U.S. Steel (now USX) has its headquarters in Pittsburgh, but many of the companys 49,000 employees are now in Indiana, Alabama, Minnesota, Illinois and Texas.   One of the biggest things Nafta accomplished was to cut steep Mexican tariffs on U.S. goods. Half of all American imports from Mexico were already duty-free before Nafta because of the 1976 Generalized System of Preferences. Mexico, on the other hand, imposed brutal tariffs on American goods. The U.S. tariff on Mexican cars was 2.5 percent; the Mexican tariff on U.S. cars was 21.5 percent.   Nafta slashed the Mexican tariff on Heinz Ketchup from 20 percent in 1993 to zero since 1998. In exchange for such dramatic reductions of Mexican tariffs, the U.S. agreed to cut an 8 percent tariff on tomatoes and cut flowers, a 26 percent tariff on frozen orange juice, and a 35 percent tariff on canned tuna. As a result, U.S. consumers saved a lot of money at the grocery store.  Tariffs dont protect jobs. They protect monopoly profits. Tariffs just raise the cost of living and the cost of production, making consumers and producers poorer. Nasty U.S. tariffs on sugar, nuts and milk, for example, impose huge costs on Hershey.   The mutual reduction of trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. made all three economies more efficient and more affluent. And, yes, Nafta was unquestionably good for Pennsylvania.

us,Brooklyns Changing Storefronts," Slide Show: Brooklyn StorefrontsPaul Lacy, 50, has lived in Brooklyn for all but two years since 1983. He has worked as a factory night watchman and an apprentice furniture maker. Now he does freelance page layout for publishers of science and technical books. But Mr. Lacy's real passion -- like that of so many New Yorkers who are defined as much by their hobbies as their day jobs -- is street photography. He has just published his first book, ""Brooklyn Storefronts,"" a collection of 75 color photographs of small, independently owned stores throughout the borough.   City Room first noticed the book, which W. W. Norton published as a paperback last month, during a visit to the Whitney Biennial; it was on sale in the gift shop. More than merely documenting the great variety of small businesses in Brooklyn, it provides a glimpse of the often rapid social and economic change that many residents fear is transforming Brooklyn neighborhoods and threatening the unique enterprises that have long made them distinctive.   In a phone interview, Mr. Lacy said he began photographing the storefronts a few years ago, often encountering subjects while riding his bicycle, whether to get some exercise, take a break from work or check out new restaurants.  ""I knew northern Brooklyn and coastal Brooklyn, but I didn't know the central Brooklyn area where I was to move,"" he said. ""In a way, I was exploring all the places that I would then patronize. If I saw a place that repaired vacuum cleaners, I would think, 'Hey, I should remember that.' ""  The images, taken since 2001, certainly reflect the eclectic nature of Brooklyn commerce -- and of Mr. Lacy's tastes. The images invite all sorts of questions. Who would have guessed that there was a taxidermist shop at 964 Jamaica Avenue in Cypress Hills, on the Brooklyn-Queens border? What is shown or performed at the Impact Theater at 190 Underhill Avenue in Prospect Heights? What kinds of ""statuettes"" and ""variety items"" are sold at Fraille Botanica at 616 Flatbush Avenue, in Flatbush? Are there other sins besides alcohol at the Sin City Lounge, at 59 Montrose Street in Williamsburg? What does the Egyptian iconography signify outside the Smai Tawi Afrakan Kultural Wellness and Martial Art Center, at 106 Kingston Avenue in Crown Heights -- and what explains the unusual spelling?  In the foreword to the book, Mr. Lacy admits that his visual record of Brooklyn's storefronts might seem ""a bit odd,"" and indeed, some store owners would pop outside to ask why he was taking snapshots. Mr. Lacy writes:   Granted, ""you can't judge a book by its cover,"" but a small, independently owned store is singular and so is a handpainted sign. When you see one, you have to wonder whether there will be something inside not found in the other stores, let alone the chains and franchises. Very often there is: a lovingly made dish made from a family recipe, a display of photographs or posters, a funny story, catchy tunes from another land: there are so many surprises.   Mr. Lacy moved to Brooklyn in 1982, a year after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied painting. He has lived in a wide variety of Brooklyn neighborhoods: Greenpoint, Williamsburg, East Williamsburg (or is it Bushwick?), Boerum Hill, Gowanus, Fort Greene and now Crown Heights.   Mr. Lacy said the book ""came about somewhat by chance"" when the owner of a garage with a 12-foot-high Trinidadian flag painted on the door asked to see some of Mr. Lacy's other pictures. Mr. Lacy made those prints to show to the store owner; Mr. Lacy also showed the prints to a friend, who passed them on to James L. Mairs, an editor at Norton and the publisher of Quantuck Lane Press, which publishes photography books.  Virtually all the 75 businesses in the book have hand-made signs, a feature that Mr. Lacy considers particularly distinctive. There is not a Starbucks, a bank branch or a chain store among the 160 pages.  ""For me, this is an exploration I have not finished,"" Mr. Lacy said in the interview. But even as he continues his photography journey, the stores themselves are changing.   Indeed, by the time Mr. Lacy wrote the foreword to his book in September 2007, he estimated that one-fifth of the storefronts had already changed during the previous five years. ""Their signs have been painted over, or replaced by a new sign, or the business has changed altogether,"" he wrote. ""And there are new stores with new signs. In this sense, the book could never be complete.""   Asked what criteria were used to select images, Mr. Lacy reflected a bit and wrote in an e-mail message, ""It was never stated outright while Jim and I were selecting the pictures, because we were proceeding intuitively, but one way to think about it is warmth. Warmth -- the way people talk about vinyl records as having a warmer sound than do CDs. ... So yes, there is nostalgia, but also there is a timeless value, a preference, if you will, for that which is warm and friendly.""   The images are crisply focused and artfully composed, but Mr. Lacy's technology is rather simple. He used a Canon digital point-and-shoot camera to take the photographs, although he has worked in the past with single-lens reflex cameras, which more advanced photographers generally prefer.   ""I'd go back and visit the same place until I felt it was the right time to take the picture,"" Mr. Lacy said, explaining that he often waited for a time of day with more compelling light, or even for a day when different alternate-side parking rules were in effect so that cars would not obstruct his view of the storefronts. Even as the stores change, the parking rules, it seems, remain constant.  ",2008-04-08T18:43:04+0000

Fidentia was placed under administration last February, accused of stealing client funds, with losses estimated at as much as 1 billion rand ($130 million). An investigation found that the company had invested in private equity ventures outside the mandate given by investors and its license conditions, and that client funds had been used to pay for the personal expenses of its chairman, Arthur Brown. Mr. Brown, who has denied wrongdoing, is to face trial by Oct. 3, the South African Press Association reported last month. The companys accountant, Graham Maddock, was sentenced to a seven-year term under a plea deal, the news agency said. ",2008-04-09T04:00:00+0000

us,Immigration Stories,"By Julia Preston   During two years as the national immigration correspondent for The New York Times, I have received many e-mail messages from readers recounting their struggles with the United States immigration system. These readers were often American citizens and legal immigrants who said they were determined to follow the law. Yet they described heavy burdens the federal bureaucracy imposed on them as they tried to play by the rules.  They wrote of being separated from loved ones because of unpredictable backlogs and delays, or immigration officers' hasty decisions, or inadvertent missteps by family members in the labyrinth of federal paperwork. In some cases, immigrants who spent years completing advanced studies here and had job offers lined up instead left the country because of quotas on employment visas.  The readers described shuttling between United States Citizenship and Immigration Services and the State Department, two agencies that divide immigration tasks in confusing and sometimes conflicting ways. Both bureaucracies, they said, seemed overwhelmed, hobbled by inadequate resources and by a limited supply of legal visas compared to the numbers of immigrants seeking them.   I think more Americans need to understand how the current system is making things difficult for people who are trying to do things the legal way, wrote Kelly Phillips, a Coast Guard seaman from California whose husband is Mexican. I feel that more individuals would do things legally if the manner for doing so was more reasonable.   Below are stories I compiled from e-mail and interviews of six people, including Ms. Phillips, who are representative of many more Times readers. If you have a similar story to share about difficulties you have experienced trying to do the right thing in the legal immigration system, please do so by submitting a comment below (briefly  a paragraph or two, please).  *****  KEITH HARRIS, United States citizen, North Carolina  In early March Mr. Harriss wife, Claudia Solano-Lopez, and their three small children left their home in Raleigh, N.C., to move to Mexico City. To comply with immigration law, the family now must live apart for two years.   Mr. Harris, who is 37 and a veteran of the first Persian Gulf war, met his future wife in 1997 when they both were studying for doctoral degrees in food science at Ohio State University. They married in 2001. They completed their Ph.D.s, and last year Mr. Harris became an assistant professor at North Carolina State University.   Ms. Solano-Lopez, 45, had come from Mexico on a visa for advanced studies (its official name is J-1) that requires immigrants to return to their home countries for at least two years after completing their academic work. Distressed by the prospect of separation and its impact on their children (3-year-old twins and a toddler), Mr. Harris and his wife consulted several lawyers. On their advice, they applied for a hardship waiver from the two-year foreign residency rule, as it is known.  We understood that we were doing the correct thing, and this waiver was the way we would keep our family together, Mr. Harris said. But the letter they received from Citizenship and Immigration Services denying the waiver said the familys separation would not be exceptional hardship.  If they think this is minor emotional anguish, they dont know what they are talking about, Mr. Harris said.  With his first-year professors schedule and salary, he felt he could not care for their three children alone in Raleigh. The couple did not appeal the waiver denial, because their lawyers said their chances of success were small.   Noting that many Mexicans live illegally in North Carolina, Mr. Harris said, I feel this is almost a punishment for following the rules.   *****  RONALD PERKINS, United States citizen, Illinois  After his first wife died five years ago, Mr. Perkins, a 63-year-old postal worker in Champaign, Ill., met a woman from the Dominican Republic and married her there in June 2005. He is still waiting for his new wife, Ana Perkins, to be allowed to come to the United States.  In general, residence visas should be easier to obtain for spouses of American citizens than for other immigrants because there are no annual limits on spouse visas. In November 2005, Mr. Perkins applied for a conditional visa for his wife that would make it relatively easy for her to get a permanent resident visa, known as a green card, after she entered the United States. By July 2006, visa authorities confirmed that Mr. and Mrs. Perkins had submitted all the required documents and their file was complete.  They were placed in line to wait for a required consular interview at the United States Embassy in Santo Domingo  behind more than 26,000 other people. By October 2007 they had inched forward, but more than 7,000 people were still ahead of them.  Then, Mr. Perkins wrote in an e-mail message, they changed the rules.  The embassy announced it would no longer manage scheduling of its consular interviews. Instead, the scheduling would be handled at the National Visa Center, a State Department site in Portsmouth, N.H. Mr. Perkins was told that their file would be sent there but that it might no longer be complete. Since the file would now be examined by officers in New Hampshire and not Santo Domingo, Mrs. Perkinss Dominican documents would require certified translations from Spanish to English.  That turned out to be a lesser problem. Recently, their file seems to have been lost in the system. The National Visa Center currently reports it has no record of their case.   I am told to be patient, Mr. Perkins wrote. He looks at the immigration agencies performance with the eye of a citizen who is also a federal employee.   Someone has created a monster here, he commented by telephone. There are so many places that could be streamlined, I dont even know where to start.  He tries to keep his sense of humor. If you only see your wife three times a year, you have three honeymoons, Mr. Perkins said. But that doesnt make up for the time apart.   *****  KELLY PHILLIPS, United States citizen, California  Ms. Phillips met her future husband, a lawyer and officer in the Mexican Navy, when his ship paid a California port visit in the summer of 2005. They married in Mexico in March 2006. They are currently going through the routine procedures to obtain his permanent resident visa. So far it has cost them about $2,800 in fees and travel expenses, and he may still be years away from receiving the green card.   At first Ms. Phillips, who is 29, and her husband, Juan Jos Castillo Zarate, 40, intended to live in Mexico. But her husbands naval unit, based in Baja California, faced threats from drug traffickers, she said. A friend of Mr. Castillo, another Mexican naval officer, was abducted and beheaded by a drug gang, and his head was sent to his family, she said. Ms. Phillips and Mr. Castillo, fearing for the safety of their infant child and also struggling financially, decided to move to the United States. He resigned from the Mexican Navy, and she joined the United States Coast Guard.   In October 2006, they began the process of filing for a type of visa (known as a K-3) that would allow Mr. Castillo, as the husband of a citizen, to live and work in the United States while pursuing his green card. It was the beginning of a dizzying bureaucratic journey, with one form leading to another (I-130 to I-129F to G-325A to AR-11 to I-131 to I-864 to I-485, etc.), and many forms bringing their own filing fees. Since fee increases last year, the most important form, the green card application, now costs $1,010.  Last August, Mr. Castillo flew from Baja California to Ciudad Jurez ($380 round trip) for an interview at the only United States consulate in Mexico that processes K-3 visa applications. The appointment nearly failed because Mr. Castillo, following instructions on the forms, had filled them out by hand, but the consulate accepted only typewritten forms. After paying $50 to have the forms typed on the street and $50 for an extra night in a Ciudad Jurez hotel, in addition to $135 for a required medical exam, Mr. Castillo passed the interview.   Last fall he was admitted to the United States. From her Coast Guard salary, Ms. Phillips has been supporting the family and paying the immigration fees  just barely. In February, after more trips and fees, Mr. Castillo received his authorization to work.   I did everything that was expected of me legally, and at times it was very hard and almost out of my reach financially, Ms. Phillips said. You get in line with everyone else, but you have no idea how long that line is and how many fees there are.  It is worth it to do it the right way; it really is, she said. I just think more people would not resort to sneaking if it were easier and more affordable to do it the legal way.    *****  NANCY KUZNETSOV, United States citizen, North Carolina   Nancy Kuznetsov, a car sales manager in Durham, N.C., must wait nearly nine years before her husband, Vitali Kuznetsov, can return to the United States. He was deported in January 2007.   (Photo: Nancy and Vitali Kuznetsov.)    Mr. Kuznetsov, a 32-year-old citizen of Belarus, is a hockey player. He came to the United States legally in 1998 to try out for a team in West Virginia. Due to an injury, he failed to make that team, but was eventually offered a place on a team in North Carolina. Friends of that team filed papers to extend his visa.   Mrs. Kuznetsov said, in an interview, that she met her future husband through friends in October 2000. By then Mr. Kuznetsov, without seeking an experienced immigration lawyer, had filed additional documents trying to straighten out his status that only made his situation worse.   Drawn together, the couple married in April 2001. But lawyers told them that even though Mrs. Kuznetsov was an American citizen, her husbands prior problems left him no way under immigration law to recover his legal status without leaving the country for 10 years.   Mrs. Kuznetsov, who is 47 and supporting a daughter still in high school, felt she could not leave. An Army veteran, she has another daughter and a son-in-law on active duty in the Air Force who rely on her for child care when both are deployed. She runs an on-line family clothing business in addition to her job in car sales. She and Mr. Kuznetsov decided to remain in the United States, hoping for a change in the law to help them.   Immigration agents arrested Mr. Kuznetsov at their home in December 2006. He is barred from coming back to this country for 10 years from the date of his deportation.   What is painful is not having a way to fix things, Mrs. Kuznetsov said. Separating a married couple for 10 years seems so cruel and out of proportion to the violation.    *****  POONAM SHARMA, 32, Legal immigrant from India, New York  Poonam Sharma came to the United States from India as a legal immigrant with her parents 17 years ago, when she was 15. At the current pace of the immigration system, she will be at least 42 before she receives a permanent residents visa.   Ms. Sharma said she had always been careful to maintain her legal status and pay her taxes. On student visas, she completed her education with a masters degree in psychology from the City University of New York. (As an immigrant, she paid higher rates than in-state students.) Six years ago she obtained a temporary H-1B visa for highly educated immigrants.   She applies her psychology skills at a job with a nonprofit organization in New York assisting students with disabilities.   I am teacher, counselor, friend to the students, she said. Part of her work is to help disabled high school students prepare to find and hold jobs once they graduate. I am an immigrant trying to ensure that American children are employable in the future, Ms. Sharma said in an interview.  Certain that the United States has become her home, she applied last year for an employment-based green card. The waiting list is about 10 years long. While she waits, she cannot change employers or accept a promotion.   Its 10 years in limbo, she said. I cant think of my life, of buying a house, of my growth at my company.   She wrote in an e-mail message: I went through hell to keep myself legal. But no one cares.   *****  GLENYS OLD, United States citizen, West Virginia  Glenys Old came to live in the United States from her native Britain after an on-line romance with Curtis Old, an American who is a computer systems administrator living in Wardensville, W.Va. They married in 2002, and Mrs. Old and a daughter have become United States citizens. But her son, Michael Head, spent the last five years fighting the immigration system because of a bureaucratic glitch.   (Photo: The Old family.)   After Glenys and Curtis were engaged, her daughter, a teenager, came with her to the United States on a temporary visa as the minor child of a fiance. Her son, Mr. Head, came on the same visa in May 2003, and he immediately applied to adjust to a green card. Mr. Head turned 21 in July 2003, between the time when he presented his application and the August date he was given by Citizenship and Immigration Services for a required interview. To the familys shock, the examiner who interviewed Mr. Head said that since he was no longer a minor, he had aged out and could not adjust to a green card.   Immigration officials insisted that Mr. Heads eligibility was not pegged to the date when he filed his application, but to the agencys processing, which is chronically backlogged and unpredictable. They said Mr. Head would have to leave the United States to start over applying for a different visa, one that had a waiting list at that point of at least five years. While Mrs. Old and her daughter received their green cards, Mr. Head received a deportation order.  Mrs. Old, who is 47, has been battling her sons case ever since. He has a steady job as a truck driver and a steady girlfriend in the United States, and no immediate family in Britain.   It just has put so much strain on our family; its just been hell, Mrs. Old said. Families really are being torn apart by such unfair treatment.   While Mr. Head currently has no permanent visa to remain in the United States, he also cannot leave freely. The authorities declined to give him permission to travel this year with his family to Britain for his grandmothers funeral. If he had left the United States, he would not have been able to return.        ",2008-04-11T21:32:15+0000

No one is mistaking his wife for a hat. The people in this book are having seizures, running after their loved ones with kitchen knives, waking up in unfamiliar towns with no idea how they got there. Rather than spotlighting the rococo workings of the human brain, the author highlights its bald frailty: the ease with which a tap on the head, as Mason puts it, can blow apart a life.",2008-04-13T04:00:00+0000

Then the sudden loss of temper, the storming from the room, the slamming door at the end of the hall and the appalled silence afterward. But I could deflect all this. I would play the fool, or be the baby, distract him from the mounting wave of boredom and frustration he must have felt at being trapped within the suffocating domestic atmosphere my mother liked to foster.

Now Rosamond is 73 and near death, and she decides to speak the tale of that failure into a tape recorder so Imogen can have some knowledge of her own familys history. She does this by selecting 20 photographs, then describing them and the circumstances in which they were taken. But by the time she reaches No. 16, the strain is beginning to tell: Five more to go, then. Thank goodness! I am growing tired of this story, and you must be exhausted, listening to me chatter on for hours on end. Can you bear with me for just a little longer, Imogen?

Deval Patrick last September: the authorization of destination casinos across the commonwealth. The plan was for Massachusetts to sell three 10-year licenses for at least $200 million apiece and then tax the casinos takings at 27 percent, raking in $400 million a year. That, went the reckoning, would cover a $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Patrick was backed by The Boston Globe, big casino corporations and some trade unions. His opponent, the House speaker, Salvatore DiMasi, warned of human devastation and suggested that Massachusetts could aim higher. We are the Athens of America, DiMasi said at a St. Patricks Day breakfast. Do we really want this? Do we need this casino culture?",2008-04-13T04:00:00+0000

us,Remembering John Paul II in New York,"Pope John Paul II waved as he arrived at Newark International Airport on Oct. 4, 1995. (Photo: Monica Almeida/The New York Times)  Slide Show: The Last Papal Visit to New YorkIn a gray drizzle, John Paul II came down the jetliner steps with care, limping but still iron-willed at 75, and stood on a red carpet on the tarmac at Newark International Airport. He did not bend to kiss the ground, a gesture he reserved for his first visits to a country -- and this was his fourth to America.  The burdens of 17 years as pope were obvious. The mountaineer's shoulders were bent, and the big Slavic face was lined with the years. A hand trembled with Parkinson's disease. But the man who had cried out for humanity at Auschwitz and Hiroshima, who had begged for peace in Ireland and roared for justice in Poland, still had miles to go.  He beamed and made the Sign of the Cross with the fluid gestures of a parish priest. He shook hands with President Clinton and waded into a throng of senators, governors, cardinals, bishops and 800 other dignitaries sheltering under clumps of black umbrellas.  It was Oct. 4, 1995, the start of his final four-day visit to the New York area, and a heavy schedule of Masses, conferences and appearances lay ahead. But he seemed in no hurry. Along a fence on his way to the car, he stopped to greet Sister Miriam Anne Evanoff and her schoolchildren from Jersey City. He reached across to touch them.  ""Praised be Jesus Christ,"" the nun said, her eyes glistening with tears as she offered the traditional Polish greeting.  ""Forever, Amen,"" the pope responded in his native tongue.  Myron Maslowyca, 13, tried his family's Ukrainian: ""Glory be to Jesus Christ.""  ""Glory, forever,"" the pope said softly, in Ukrainian.  It was one of those touching, spontaneous moments of human contact that, even after all these years, people remember when they think of John Paul.  (Photo: The pope was welcomed by President Clinton in Newark. (Photo: Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)) Security agents and advance planners try to arrange papal trips down to the last detail, fixing routes, timing events, limiting potentially dangerous contacts with the public, trying to prevent the kind of violence in which John Paul was shot in St. Peter's Square in 1981.  But the truth is that elaborate plans are often flawed, and that the pope's spontaneous moments -- the small asides and intuitive reactions to strangers -- often leave the most lasting impressions, those glimpses into the personality behind the public face and the studied pronouncements.  On John Paul's last visit to the city 13 years ago, what most people saw was just a tiny gold-and-white figure on a distant altar during the Masses he celebrated for biblical multitudes on the Great Lawn in Central Park, at Aqueduct Race Track in Queens and at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands.  But a more revealing episode, for thousands who witnessed it, was the pope's moment of impulse outside St. Patrick's Cathedral on his last day in town, when he emerged after reciting the Rosary and, instead of stepping into his Popemobile and riding away, he decided to take a stroll around the block.  ""He's walking! He's walking!"" someone cried.  And the crowd of more than 6,000, which had hoped for no more than a fleeting glimpse from behind the barricades, suddenly roared and surged after him. A few people actually touched the pontiff before scrambling police officers and Secret Service agents caught up and formed a protective ring around him. John Paul was unruffled and it was all harmless.  But it was not unusual for John Paul. People everywhere found his presence intensely physical. In his visits to 129 nations on 104 trips abroad, he often made protocol chiefs wince and horrified security officers. Not content to wave from a passing limousine, he would jump out and plunge into the crowds, hugging strangers, kissing babies, singing, smiling, winking, reaching out to touch and bless people.  On his first papal trip to his Polish homeland -- a journey that defied the Communist government -- his presence dominated life for nine days, drawing workers away from jobs to outdoor Masses attended by throngs that stretched across hillsides. He sang hymns and folk songs with his people, clasped old friends in headlocks and talked to coal miners, housewives, college students and teenagers in blue jeans.  John Paul leaving St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue after offering Mass on Oct. 7, 1995. Enlarge this image. (Photo: Keith Meyers/The New York Times) Throughout his 26-year papal reign, John Paul was theologically conservative -- many would say intransigent -- but almost from the start it was clear that he was not to be a traditional pope, ascetic and remote behind the high walls and elaborate ceremonies of the Vatican.  Here was a different kind of pope: deftly politic, schooled in confrontation, a physically expressive man of wit, daring and energy who had seen war and sweeping political changes in the world, a showman of the television-and-jet age who would captivate much of humanity by sheer force of personality.  He had been a poet and playwright, an author of books and articles, a philosopher, a debater, an actor, a factory worker, a professor of social ethics and a linguist skilled in a dozen languages. He had been an athlete and outdoorsman most of his life -- a soccer player, backpacker, camper and boater who loved to ski, swim and climb mountains. And he looked it: a rugged, ruddy-faced man with a bullish neck, pastry-maker hands and the legs of a long-distance runner. He moved gracefully until age began to interfere.  Ultimately, John Paul, who died in April 2005, helped end the cold war, contributed to the defeat of European Communism, made ecumenical gestures to Jews, Orthodox Christians and other faiths and reshaped his church with a vision of combative, disciplined Catholicism.  His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, despite almost three years on the Throne of St. Peter, is largely unknown to New Yorkers and even to many American Catholics. He turns 81 on Wednesday, has been abroad six times as pope and has made no deep impression on people around the world. Experts who know him as the German-born former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, John Paul's arch-conservative Vatican defender of the faith, say he is scholarly and tough beneath a mild exterior.  This week, as Benedict visits America for five days, including three in the New York area, crowds are expected to line his routes, attend his Masses, follow his movements on television and hear him address the United Nations. He is to meet President Bush at the White House, visit ground zero and St. Patrick's Cathedral and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium. He is also to meet with Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and members of other faiths, as well as Catholic leaders, seminarians and parishioners.  Impressions of Benedict may come primarily from what he has to say -- much of which he has said before -- opposition to the war in Iraq, regrets over the priest sexual-abuse scandals, praise for American religious toleration and rejection of secularism and changes in church teaching on birth control, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women, homosexuality and other issues that trouble American Catholics.  Security will be the tightest ever, the authorities say, with backpacks banned, spectators searched and audiences vetted at every venue. And Benedict will travel in an enclosed Popemobile, limiting chance encounters with people. His visit thus may be a sequel, but in the cautious age of terrorism, impressions of the pope -- especially the emotional connections many felt toward John Paul -- may be limited.

us,Pennsylvania Stagnation: Is Nafta the Culprit?,"The Democratic presidential primary in Pennsylvania has drawn attention to troubles in the states manufacturing sector and to the role played by the North American Free Trade Agreement specifically and by global trade generally. Despite isolated success stories, Pennsylvania manufacturing has experienced job loss and stagnation for over a decade. Not everything that has gone wrong with the Pennsylvania economy is due to trade, but the worries of workers in the state (and throughout the country) about what globalization means for their living standards are well-founded.  Nafta became the framework for the global economy when it took effect in 1994. It was followed by the World Trade Organization in 1995 and by numerous similar agreements. While these deals were not responsible for globalization, they certainly encouraged the rapidly growing trade and investment that has occurred in the past decade.   There is no doubt that American manufacturing has been hard hit by globalization. Between 1967 and 2000, manufacturing employment went up or down with the business cycle, but never dipped below 16.5 million workers. Since 2001, the U.S. has lost 3.4 million manufacturing jobs and employment dipped below 14 million.   Pennsylvania manufacturing has been even harder hit, with 208,000 jobs lost  a 24 percent decline  in the same period. Overall employment growth in the state continues to lag that of the rest of the country; jobs in the nation as a whole have grown three times as fast as jobs in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, real median wages in Pennsylvania fell 2 percent between 2001 and 2007.   Some have mistakenly blamed productivity growth or slow demand for manufactured goods for manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania and nationally, arguing that the sectors decline is inevitable. This is wrong. Manufacturing has always enjoyed fast productivity growth, and demand for its goods remains strong. What has changed in the past decade is that a much larger share of goods purchased by U.S. consumers are now imported, and jobs displaced by these imports have not been replaced by export-supported jobs.  In the decade after Nafta, growing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada eliminated 44,000 jobs in Pennsylvania and more than a million nationwide. In this decade, China has overtaken Nafta as the source of our largest trade deficit. From 2001, when it entered the W.T.O., to 2006, the growth of the American trade deficit with China eliminated an additional 78,000 Pennsylvania jobs alone. In both cases, about two-thirds of the losses were in manufacturing.   Some have argued that job growth and unemployment are affected by factors other than trade, and that workers laid off from manufacturing plants are more likely than not to find new jobs. True enough, but when a steelworker loses his job in a mill and ends up as a greeter at Wal-Mart, would anybody honestly say that he has not ""lost a job""?  These displaced workers are only the most visible casualties of trade. Job displacement and competition for manufacturing jobs with workers in low-wage countries like Mexico and China depress the wages of not just industrial workers, but of all workers throughout the economy with similar skills and credentials. Landscapers may not know that their wages are being hurt by trade, but when laid-off steelworkers crowd into their labor force, they are.   Josh Bivens, my colleague at the Economic Policy Institute, recently wrote that in 2006, trade with low-wage countries pulled down wages of workers without a college degree by roughly 4 percent. For a married couple with no college degrees and with kids, earning the median wage, this means that trade flows have cost this household more than $2,000. This is, by the way, the net effect of trade: it takes into account the presumed savings the family members enjoy in the form of cheap foreign goods, like that T-shirt at Wal-Mart, and the presumed ability to secure work in exporting industries.  It doesnt have to be this way. For starters, we can take a number of steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, like forcing China to end its unfair trade practices and insisting on improvements in labor rights in Mexico and other countries. Reducing the American trade deficit can help expand U.S. exports, which have been the most rapidly growing sector of the economy for the past year, thus helping Pennsylvanias manufacturing workers.   The conversation about trade is too important to be relegated to election season polemics. An intelligent discussion will begin when the conventional wisdom catches up to the reality faced by workers in Pennsylvania and the rest of the country.   Robert E. Scott is a senior international economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.   ",2008-04-16T01:14:02+0000

On perhaps the most profound level, the question of why this troubled and angry youth chose to plan and carry out the killings may never be fully answered. But there were a host of other issues that had relevance for other universities and for policymakers in general. They include:* whether Mr. Chos history of mental illness should have barred him from purchasing the guns he used, and whether the system needed to be tightened* whether campuses would be safer if more students and faculty members could have guns to use to protect themselves* whether concerns over privacy stood in the way of adequate steps being taken to protect Mr. Chos classmates and himself* and what if any changes needed to be made to emergency response procedures at schools across the country.A group of people with expertise on different aspects of these questions has agreed to discuss these issues.

It Depends.,"A 90-minute Dancing With the Stars may have afforded ABC the most viewers over all on Monday, but in the important demographic of adults 18 to 49 CBS eked out a slight victory thanks to its comedy lineup. Nielsen reported that Dancing With the Stars averaged 17 million viewers from 8 to 9:30 p.m., easily the nights largest audience, but down considerably from the 19.7 million the show drew a week ago. Meanwhile, CBSs 9 p.m. comedy Two and a Half Men (13.8 million) delivered the nights top ratings in the 18-to-49 set. CBS remained in the lead in that demographic at 9:30 with Rules of Engagement (10.3 million), which significantly outperformed ABCs sitcom Samantha Who? among adults 18 to 49 despite the ABC shows competitive showing in total viewers (10 million).

(Photo: Rob Carr/Associated Press))    By this time exactly one year ago, two students lay dead of gunshot wounds at Virginia Tech, an event that would by itself have been the latest addition to a sad storyline of campus shootings. But 30 more students and faculty members would die there at the gunman's hand that day, leaving Virginia Tech to recover from the most violent blow that an American university had ever suffered.  How would the campus respond? How would students and staff move on? Today, on the anniversary of the massacre, voices at the university seem to agree: As the nation checks in on Virginia Tech, the campus is continuing to look inward, resolutely insisting on mourning at its own pace.   Since midnight, the school's Corps of Cadets has stood continuous guard in 15-minute shifts before a candle lit in the victims' memory. Hour by hour, a Roanoke Times blogger has recorded moments both moving and mundane at the scene.   There were tears and praying, but also joggers ""decked out in Spandex and wind gear"" speeding past the memorial site, and cadets breaking the solemn tribute for ""friendly chatter."" They are, after all, just kids.   It seemed to be a fitting illustration of the struggle to ""move this institution forward,"" as Charles W. Steger, the university president, put it in one interview. At 10:30 a.m. Eastern, he will lead a commemoration by reading the names of the 32 victims and offer ""a few words about the special qualities"" about each of them. (The event will be held ""rain or shine,"" a notice said, but the forecast calls for clear skies, calm winds and temperatures in the 60s. More on the ceremony from The Associated Press.)  (Photo: Emergency responders carried victims from Norris Hall on the Blacksburg, Va., campus on April 16, 2007. (Photo: Alan Kim, The Roanoke Times via Associated Press))   There will be many other events in Blacksburg, Va., today to mark the anniversary as well. And it's also being marked on the Web, where news of the tragedy unfolded for the students as well as the rest of the nation. A 9-minute video clip posted on Planet Blacksburg is intensely upbeat. Several members of the community shared more shaded thoughts in interviews published today in Collegiate Times, a campus paper.  ""We didn't try to pretend it didn't happen,"" Nikki Giovanni, the renowned poet and professor at Virginia Tech, told Collegiate Times. ""And we didn't try to pretend that we didn't get hurt, because we were, and we are.""  Anthony Della Calce, a former student, wrote in a Blacksburg Planet column published today that Ms. Giovanni's speech at a convocation on the night after the shooting had a lot to do with starting the healing:  Her words triggered a mournful crowd to erupt into a resilient chant of Lets Go Hokies. And a phrase repeated over and over in her poem, We Are Virginia Tech, has become a rallying cry for Hokies everywhere.  More than the hurt is shared among Hokies, he added -- there is also pride for those who sacrificed their lives, like Liviu Librescu, the professor who died blocking a classroom door to the gunman.   ""The dynamic of the story of that day is not fully understood through grief and tears,"" Mr. Della Calce wrote. ""Through the cloak of tragedy, inspirational moments emerged.""

Deval Patrick. The state had appropriated $472 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, but enrollment in the states subsidized insurance programs for low- and middle-income workers exceeded expectations. About 340,000 of the states estimated 600,000 uninsured have gained coverage since Massachusetts began requiring health insurance. The state had projected that 136,000 people would sign up for its Commonwealth Care policies, but 174,000 are now enrolled. Cyndi Roy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Patrick, a Democrat, said this years shortfall would be offset by surplus revenues in the states general fund. For the coming fiscal year, Mr. Patrick has requested $869 million for Commonwealth Care, but his aides have already conceded that will not be enough as enrollment continues to grow.

us,Finland: A Plan for Love Vacations," A proposed bill before Parliament would grant Finnish workers, already entitled to 25 paid days of vacation a year and as many as 10 paid public holidays, one more week of love vacation to reduce, its sponsor said, a high divorce rate and revive passion in a population whose workdays are growing longer. The measure would allow Finns to connect on an erotic as well as an emotional level, Tommy Tabermann, a poet, actor and member of the Social Democrats, said in a speech introducing the measure last month. To get to a vote, his proposal needs the backing of 100 members, or half, of Parliament. It now has 13 signatures. Some lawmakers suggested that the idea might get more support if the leave were unpaid. People can take love vacations but shouldnt be paid for them, said Bjarne Kallis, the head of the Christian Democrat delegation. You have a lot of free time already today. ",2008-04-17T04:00:00+0000

The find, by the national Revenue Guard Corps, took place while the corpss Archaeological Heritage Safeguard Unit was safeguarding a protected area from thieves. The sarcophagus, probably once the property of an aristocratic family, was excavated in the area of the Isola Sacra Necropolis, a large Roman Imperial-era pagan cemetery in the town of Fiumicino, site of Romes main airport and a few miles from the famous ancient ruins of Ostia. The coffin presents an exquisite frieze showing the sun god Apollo escorting the nine Muses in the presence of Athena, the Greek goddess of knowledge and heroic endeavor. The sarcophagus, archaeologists say, is not only an invaluable work of art but also a representation of a political elite that regarded culture and education as essential to reaching the afterlife. The remains inside the sarcophagus are being analyzed by the Luigi Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnology in Rome. ",2008-04-18T04:00:00+0000

As part of the agreement, Yellowstone will commit $1.5 million, with an additional amount that will be paid largely by conservation groups, to a 30-year lease for the ranch land north of the park. Record numbers of bison have been killed this winter as part of a culling effort to protect cattle from brucellosis, sometimes carried by the bison, and to keep bison from roaming outside the park. The culling has angered groups trying to protect bison and drew criticism in a Government Accountability Office report. State and park officials hope the additional land, more than 5,000 acres, will save bison and cattle. This is a good day for bison, livestock, and Montana, said Gov. Brian Schweitzer, above.

us,Germany: Odd-Couple Parties Join Forces in Hamburg," Chancellor Angela Merkels conservative party, the Christian Democrats, and the left-wing environmentalist Greens agreed to join forces to form a government coalition in Hamburg. The alliance could set a precedent, on the federal level as well, and become potentially a turning point in German politics. The accord was reached seven weeks after the Christian Democrats lost their majority in Hamburg, forcing them to seek a partner to remain in power. Despite the parties longstanding differences, Ole von Beust, the conservative mayor, decided to open negotiations with the Greens rather than ask his partys traditional partner, the Social Democrats, to enter into a coalition, because, his aides said, of growing public disillusionment over how the so-called grand coalition of that party and his has performed on the federal stage.

It includes a permanent exhibition devoted to the 1950s, temporary art shows and a restaurant 335 feet above the ground, where spectacular views are offered, along with Ostend oysters and the chicken dish known as Mechelen cuckoo.

The episode opens during a storm on the Bering Sea, in which the Wizard, a fishing boat, appears in danger of sinking. But the flooded boat was filmed in September, and the huge waves shown crashing into the boat were shot in October, according to the production outline, which The Reporter obtained. (A scene from a different episode is shown above.) Additional footage was also shot to help stitch the two events together. The outline directs producers of the show to patch together a scene of life-and-death peril from different days of filming, but Discovery executives said the document was an early draft that was not used. Such editing and staging tactics are common on reality shows, but Discovery considers Deadliest Catch a documentary and denies that re-enactment footage was ever used on it. John Ford, Discoverys president and general manager, said the outline was a rough draft that was rejected. He added: The Wizard was struck by a big wave, and that wave caused the leak you see in the show. The thing we didnt have on camera was the actual wave that struck the Wizard.

In an article on Thursday in The Yale Daily News, the student, Aliza Shvarts, was quoted as saying she had inseminated herself as often as possible while taking herbal drugs to induce miscarriages as her senior year performance art piece. Her account found its way to the Internet and news outlets before Yale said it had investigated and found it to be false. The entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a womans body, said Helaine Klasky, a university spokeswoman. Ms. Klasky said that when confronted by three Yale officials, Ms. Shvarts acknowledged that she had never been pregnant and did not induce abortions. On Friday, however, Ms. Shvarts had insisted that she had really experienced repeated, self-induced miscarriages, although she had said that she had never known if she was actually pregnant. Ms. Klasky responded that the university had expected her to maintain her story: She said if Yale puts out a statement saying she did not do this, she would say Yale was doing that to protect its reputation. In Fridays Yale Daily News, Ms. Shvarts said she planned to display a work that consisted of a cube lined with plastic sheets, with a mixture of blood and petroleum jelly in between, onto which she would project video footage of herself experiencing miscarriages in her bathroom tub. Andrew Mangino, the editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said the newspaper had published the article after receiving a news release about the project.

Federal Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia G. Morris approved a motion brought by lawyers for the Justice Department to convert the Salanders case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation, in which a trustee sells everything except exempt assets. The Salanders opposed the motion. Eric Small, a Justice Department lawyer, said that since the Salanders filed for bankruptcy protection in November, they had been slow to sell assets and quick to accumulate new debt. Mr. Salander ran the Salander-OReilly Galleries on the Upper East Side. By the time he filed for bankruptcy, complaints were mounting from people who said they had consigned artworks to the gallery but were never paid for them.

When built correctly, a roof garden acts as natural insulation, keeping a building warm in winter and cool in summer. In urban settings, green roofs help mitigate runoff problems, absorbing, cleaning and straining rainwater and reducing the load on city sewers. One of the big factors delaying the widespread use of green roofs in the United States, however, particularly on the tops of old buildings, is how much soil weighs. Soil  or, more accurately, growing medium  is a matter of mixture. Sand and clay, the mineral matrix in which the fertile humus lodges, are heavy, and the average roof can bear only 30 to 40 pounds a square foot. To make lightweight soil, green-roof designers have typically replaced clay and sand with ceramics and shales, adding air to make these materials less dense. And now theres garbage. Over the last few years, Paul Mankiewicz, executive director of the Bronx-based Gaia Institute, has designed one of the lightest, least-expensive soils on the market by using a patented process in which he blends locally made compost with recycled polystyrene, binding the two with a gel. The soil has a small carbon footprint because the materials are local, diverted from the waste stream  weve got plenty of old polystyrene right here in New York, Mankiewicz says. And you dont have to factor in the energy costs of firing and shipping the ceramics. Even wet, the soil, at six inches deep, weighs only 15 pounds a square foot (natural soil weighs 60). Mankiewicz estimates that if every roof in New York were greened, the city would gain 26 square miles of new plants, and temperatures could drop by several degrees in summer, depending on the density of the plant cover and how much water was used. Now to get an inexpensive system in place to water those gardens with a buildings gray water, he says. Thats my next dream. TESS TAYLOR",2008-04-20T04:00:00+0000

But when Savitt admits that her idea of branding G.E. as the (GE)nocide sponsor is wrong (The only problem, she says, is G.E. isnt actually responsible for any genocide), she is basically admitting the hypocrisy of branding the Olympic Games as genocidal. The trouble with their whole campaign is the rallying cry at its heart: Genocide Olympics. The Olympic Games are not in any way responsible for the genocide. They are a global trust that seeks to unite the youth of the world in friendship and peace through sport. The long-term damage that Farrow and Savitt may be doing to the Olympic brand, despite their insistence that they are not against the Olympics, may be the actual, sad legacy of their efforts.

Originally meant to deliver information to isolated populations lacking electricity, the Freeplay was a shortwave radio that ran only on human power. Thirty seconds of winding time produced 40 minutes of listening time. And now its starting to gain allies in its heretofore lonely battle against the battery (which Americans currently consume at the rate of three billion a year). An Idaho start-up called M2E Power is in the forefront of kinetically charged consumer electronics. Having just secured $8 million in venture capital, M2E (motion to energy) expects to introduce a biomechanical-energy harvester within 12 to 14 months  a device about the size of an iPhone that, when carried by a low-active person during the course of a couple of days, will generate a charge sufficient to power your cellphone for an hour or two. The ultimate aim is a self-charging cellphone. Bad news for the battery industry, yes  but M2E isnt all about moon-eyed idealism: half of its business model is devoted to military applications.

But potential big fix approaches to climate change  constructing immense space mirrors to deflect solar radiation, say  are often derided as science fiction that diverts talent and financing from more plausible solutions. John Holdren, for one, as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, noted its combination of high costs, low leverage and a high likelihood of serious side effects. So it was with considerable surprise in late 2006 that Paul Crutzen, one of the most prominent and respected atmospheric chemists in the world, proposed cooling the earth by pumping millions of tons of sulfur into the stratosphere. It would be the man-made equivalent of a volcanic eruption, spreading a thin layer of particles around the planet and increasing its reflectivity. Crutzens proposal appeared in the scientific journal Climatic Change, but the mainstream media quickly picked it up and set off a fierce debate over the ethics and efficacy of such large-scale human interference with the atmosphere. Crutzen, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for his work on the the ozone layer, was feeling deeply frustrated. I saw how little action was taking place on reducing greenhouse emissions, he says. He published his article in desperation, hoping that maybe this is a way of reducing the heating rate in the atmosphere. Natural science backs Crutzen up. After the massive 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, the resulting haze of sulfuric acid in the stratosphere temporarily lowered global temperatures by nearly a full degree. Doing this ourselves is complicated, of course. The sulfur would have to be carried aloft by rockets or balloons  and every year or two, at a cost of untold billions of dollars. For Crutzen, the article was intended to be provocative, to prod the discussion and encourage research. Although I want it to be debated, to test whether this solution is feasible, looking for side effects is very essential, he says. Such side effects could be profound, like a diminished ozone layer. Its not really a nice experiment to put a million tons of sulfur into the stratosphere, he says. Its a quite dirty experiment. MATTHEW POWER",2008-04-20T04:00:00+0000

us,Act,"A CLEAR SENSE OF EMISSION: Carbon-dioxide equivalents may be the most complicated currency on world markets today. A basic exchange works like this: When a company like the Gap commits to reducing emissions but cannot, or chooses not to, cut the energy used to move clothes across the globe, it finances someone elses green project. Rather than put $100, say, toward reinventing its shipping system, the Gap may spend $20 to plant trees or invest in a clean utility. If a new power plant is needed in India, carbon investments from the Gap and others make it possible to build a more expensive wind farm instead of a coal plant. Win-win, the logic goes: because carbon emissions are a global problem, it doesnt matter where they are reduced. The system of carbon trading exploded after the Kyoto Protocol and in 2006 sustained a $30 billion market representing nearly 1.7 billion tons of traded carbon dioxide. The market extends beyond signatories to include companies that participate voluntarily. These days, even individual consumers are joining in to pay offset retailers somewhere between $3 and $40 per ton in order to counter the carbon they emit driving to work or just running their refrigerators. But individuals are confronting many of the same uncertainties that companies and countries have been navigating under the Kyoto Protocol. First, how to determine your emissions? There are several calculators on the Web, but they yield different answers. When you fly, the fuel efficiency of your plane varies, Jeff Swenerton, a spokesman at Green-e, an offset-certification program, points out. He says that calculators, for example, dont factor in that all things being equal, different airplanes of the same model can have wildly different burn rates. Once you have a carbon figure, which offsets should you buy? Certification isnt standardized either. Part of the problem is in the measuring: how old should a replanted forest be before it earns credit? What if it gets logged or burns? Another issue: how do certification schemes verify that the projects they invest in add real, new carbon reduction to the market? Should credits subsidize solar power in a city that already gives solar tax breaks? There are social questions too: should certification only make sure that carbon hasnt entered the atmosphere, or should it include other goals, like sustainable development? Some argue that if a project generates less carbon but disrupts a local community, it forces the poor to take responsibility for the pollution of the rich and reinforces a model of development that created the problem of global warming in the first place. Although it has been muddled by competing standards, the market is maturing. The Voluntary Carbon Standard, created by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and two other nongovernmental organizations, is widely seen as a benchmark of quality assurance, and carbon credits certified by it sell for between $5 and $15 per ton. Credits certified by a competitor, the Gold Standard, sell for between $8 and $40 per ton, while offering additional standards for sustainable community development. We cant necessarily rely on a countrys environmental standards as adequate, says Michael Schlup, director of the Gold Standard. He also adds, We need to give something to people and places who are giving us emissions reductions safely. (The V.C.S. recognizes that the Gold Standard offers an added virtue.) Russell Simon, a spokesman for the nonprofit carbon retailer Carbonfund.org who admits the carbon-certification business really is a baffling market, says he thinks that a battle over standards can be healthy, but that one or two companies need to emerge and build trust in their brand of certification. He adds, It is a bit like the wars we used to have at the beginning of using the word organic. Now we agree what that means. TESS TAYLOR",2008-04-20T04:00:00+0000

us,Eat,"SERE GRAPES: Though ultraripe wines have been fashionable in the Napa Valley for more than a decade, climate change appears to be forcing the issue. While recent summers were cool, most Napa winemakers agree that 10-year averages are the hottest in memory. Too often, a result has been overripe grapes, and the cooked flavors and throat-searing alcohol that accompany them. If temperatures continue to rise even slightly, Napa could be in trouble. Most superior grape-growing regions enjoy cool summer nights, which allow vines to recover from the stress of the days heat. Lose that, and youre left with grapes better suited for bulk wines. If average nighttime temperatures increase even a few degrees, says Andrew Walker, a professor in the department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis, then theres really no difference between Napa and the Central Valley. Tony Truchard, whose Truchard Vineyards is located in Carneros, Napas coolest pocket, says: If I could start the California wine industry over again, I wouldnt plant on the valley floor at all. Its too hot, and its going to get hotter. But those mature vineyards are considered Napas most prestigious. And Napa retains other desirable attributes. In Napa, weve got rootstocks we like, soils we think are the best, Pat Garvey, an owner of Flora Springs Winery and Vineyards, says. Were not going anywhere. Instead, Garvey and others have set out to mitigate the heats effect. The mandate is clear: undo everything that was done in the name of ripeness during the 1990s. Those cabernet clones imported from Bordeaux because they ripen so easily? Rip them out and plant something more reluctant. Vines positioned near the ground to soak up radiant heat? Install a trellis system and pull them higher. Wineries have started planting vineyards on a northeast-southwest axis, which minimizes strong afternoon sunlight. They add cover crops  clover, bell bean  to compete with the vines and prolong the fruits maturation process. And theyre removing fewer leaves. We used to try for as much sun as possible, but weve backed off, says Doug Shafer of Shafer Vineyards. Shading has become really important. Without it, we get roasted fruit. Trying to reduce alcohol in the winery is like trying to bring a snapshot into focus in the darkroom, but it can be done. Perhaps the most widespread technique, though one rarely acknowledged, is dilution. You use what we call Jesus Units, because they turn water into wine, says the owner of a Napa Winery known for its elegant cabernets. Manual sorters, previously employed to detect rot, now look for overripe grapes. Its a large investment in labor, but it makes a significant difference, Michelle Edwards, the winemaker at Cliff Lede Vineyards, says. Last harvest on some properties, I removed as much as 10 percent of the grapes off the table because they were desiccated.  These changes cost money, but theyre less costly than allowing wines to carry such alcoholic heat that nobody wants to drink them, and less drastic than abandoning Napa cabernet altogether. Still, the future might include grape varieties that do better in hot weather, like Grenache and Syrah. If it keeps getting warmer, maybe we have to think about that, Shafer says. Maybe cabernet wont always be king here. I have a hard time saying that, but it could be the answer. BRUCE SCHOENFELD",2008-04-20T04:00:00+0000

us,Move,"HYPERMILING: Steve Chafes interest in hypermiling started with a $150 speeding ticket. Determined to avoid another one, he became a different man behind the wheel  one who didnt mind getting to his destination a few minutes later. Until then, his Honda Civic had been getting 22 miles per gallon. The next tank, it got 26. Now it gets as many as 37. The changes in my gas mileage were 100 percent a result of my thinking, says Chafe, whose Web site, hypermiling.com, exists to spread the word about the art of mileage maximization. Hypermiling was coined by Wayne Gerdes, a former nuclear-power-plant worker from Chicago whose legendary feats include getting up to 200 miles per gallon in his hybrid Honda Insight. Any driver who manages to exceed a cars E.P.A. mileage estimate can call himself a hypermiler, but it helps to have a hybrid, both because the cars dashboard readout provides instant feedback about fuel usage and because it is capable of stratospheric gains. Gerdess Web site, CleanMPG.com, is a mecca for mileage-obsessed drivers, littered with discussions of braking techniques and brag posts from drivers who log 100 miles per gallon. A lot of hypermilers are guys who would consider themselves  in a fun, positive way  geeky, says Eric Powers, who runs Hybridfest, an annual gathering of hybrid drivers in Madison, Wisc., that includes an annual M.P.G. Challenge, where hypermiling records are set. Getting triple-digit mileage requires some fairly complex maneuvers, but the average commuter can reap substantial gains just by avoiding idling, quick accelerations and heavy braking. It also helps to keep your tires well inflated and to be in the habit of going to the farthest errand first, so that your car is warm when you embark on the next one. But the simplest way to save fuel is to observe the speed limit. That alone can increase mileage by at least 12 percent. When I had my Geo Metro, I would go 70 or 75 on the freeway, says the hypermiler Jerad Parish, who won last years M.P.G. Challenge by getting 110 miles per gallon in his 2005 Prius. Now, I would never, ever do that. DASHKA SLATER",2008-04-20T04:00:00+0000

us,Yale Demands End to Students Performance,"Yale University said on Monday that it would not allow a senior to participate in a campus art exhibition unless she made a written statement that her performance, in which she repeatedly inseminated herself and then induced miscarriages, was a fiction that she had concocted. In an article on Thursday in The Yale Daily News, the student, Aliza Shvarts, right, was quoted as saying that she had inseminated herself as often as possible over several months while taking herbal drugs to induce miscarriages, which she recorded on video to display for her senior-year art project at a show beginning on campus on Tuesday. Her claim drew intense criticism. Yale said last week that Ms. Shvarts had told three university officials that she had not inseminated herself or induced abortions but had made up the story as part of the project. On Friday, however, Ms. Shvarts insisted she had really experienced repeated, self-induced miscarriages, although she said that she had not known if she was actually pregnant. Yale officials said the denials were part of the continuing art performance, and on Monday demanded that it end. Peter Salovey, the dean of Yale College, and Robert Storr, dean of the School of Art, also said that they had found serious errors of judgment on the part of Ms. Shvartss adviser and an art instructor who knew of the project. They did not identify the adviser or instructor, though Ms. Shvarts has said that her adviser was Pia Lindman. Mr. Salovey said that appropriate action had been taken against the two teachers, but did not elaborate. Neither Ms. Shvarts nor Ms. Lindman could be reached for comment.",2008-04-22T04:00:00+0000

CBSs Big Brother drew a much smaller audience at 8 (6.8 million), and its made-for-TV movie, Sweet Nothing in My Ear, averaged a mediocre 8.1 million viewers from 9 to 11. NBC was third over all, followed by Fox, which, despite an all-repeat lineup, finished in second place among adults 18 to 49.

us,Pain as an Art Form,"(Photo: Selections from the Pain Exhibit. To see a slide show, click here. ) Pain doesn't show up on a body scan and can't be measured in a test. As a result, many chronic pain sufferers turn to art, opting to paint, draw or sculpt images in an effort to depict their pain.  ""It's often much more difficult to put pain into words, which is one of the big problems with pain,'' said Allan I. Basbaum, editor-in-chief of Pain, the medical journal of The International Association for the Study of Pain. ""You can't articulate it, and you can't see it. There is no question people often try to illustrate their pain.''  (Photo: ""The Broken Column,"" by Frida Kahlo (Banco de Mxico Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo Museums Trust))   One of the most famous pain artists is Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, whose work, now on exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is imbued with the lifelong suffering she experienced after being impaled during a trolley accident as a teenager. Her injuries left her spine and pelvis shattered, resulting in multiple operations and miscarriages, and she often depicted her suffering on canvas in stark, disturbing and even bloody images.  Sacramento resident Mark Collen, 47, is a former insurance salesman who suffers from chronic back pain. After his regular doctor retired due to illness, Mr. Collen was struggling to find a way to communicate his pain to a new doctor. Although he has no artistic training, he decided to create a piece of artwork to express his pain to the physician.  ""It was only when I started doing art about pain, and physicians saw the art, that they understood what I was going through,"" Mr. Collen said. ""Words are limiting, but art elicits an emotional response.''  Mr. Collen wrote to pain doctors around the world to solicit examples of art from pain patients. Working with San Francisco college student James Gregory, 21, who suffers from chronic pain as the result of a car accident, the two created the Pain Exhibit, an online gallery of art from pain sufferers. The images are evocative and troubling.  ""Some of them are painful even to look at,'' Dr. Basbaum said. In November, he included an image from the site on the cover of Pain; it can be seen here.  Finding ways to communicate pain is essential to patients who are suffering, many of whom don't receive adequate treatment from doctors. In January, Virtual Mentor, the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, reported that certain groups are less likely to receive adequate pain care. Hispanics are half as likely as whites to receive pain medications in emergency rooms for the same injuries; older women of color have the highest likelihood of being undertreated for cancer pain; and being uneducated is a risk factor for poor pain care in AIDS patients, the journal reported.  Some of the images from the Pain Exhibit, like ""Broken People"" by Robert S. Beal of Tulsa, Okla., depict the physical side of pain. Others, such as ""Against the Barrier to Life,"" convey the emotional challenges of chronic pain. ""I feel like I am constantly fighting against a tidal wave of pain in order to achieve some quality of life,'' wrote the work's creator, Judith Ann Seabrook of Happy Valley in South Australia. ""I am in danger of losing the fight and giving up.''  Mr. Collen said the main goal of the exhibit is to raise awareness about the problem of chronic pain. However, he said he hopes one day to find a sponsor to take the exhibit on tour.  ""People don't believe what they can't see,'' Mr. Collen said. ""But they see a piece of art an individual created about their pain and everything changes.''   To see a slide show of selections from the Pain Exhibit, click here, or visit the Web site to see the full gallery of photos. Another slide show from The Times in February features art created by migraine sufferers.    ",2008-04-22T10:59:03+0000

The agency said atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide reached nearly 385 parts per million last year, up from 280 in 1850 and an increase of 2.6 parts per million from 2006, chiefly from the burning of fossil fuels. The methane situation is less clear. Methane is produced naturally by swamps but also by activities including burning fossil fuels. The issue is important because climate experts have long worried that if Arctic permafrost thaws, the process would release potentially catastrophic amounts of methane into the atmosphere. In a statement, the agency said the most likely causes of the methane increase were economic development in Asia and emissions from Arctic wetlands. It said it was too soon to tell if the increase signals an Arctic thaw. ",2008-04-24T04:00:00+0000

The city announced on Thursday at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam that the heirs would be given title to five important Malevich paintings owned by the city that have been in the Stedelijks collection for many years. In return, the heirs have agreed to drop claims to the other works and end a lawsuit filed against the city. The heirs had said that the 14 artworks were among more than 100 that Malevich took to Berlin in 1927 for an exhibition.

Campbell is one, and Kelly, coming out of college, was considered one of the top receivers available, but injuries and perceived attitude problems hurt him.

Or maybe its competition?26/57. Miami: Chad Henne, QB, MichiganAnd here come the quarterbacks. This years class is not deep, but it is a bit surprising that we have gone 57 picks and only four quarterbacks have been taken.27/58. JacksonvilleTampa Bay: Dexter Jackson, WR, Appalachian StateThe Buccaneers, after trading down for this pick, used up all of their seven minutes, the first team to see the clock go down to 0:00 so far in this streamlined draft, as the N.F.L. likes to call it. And they used all the time for a player they already had. Oh, different Dexter Jackson. That Jackson, a safety now with the Bengals, was the Super Bowl MVP for Tampa Bay in 2003.28/59. Indianapolis: Michael Pollak, OG, Arizona StateThis was the Colts only first-day pick, but the last offensive lineman on a day for the trenches, which was expected.

Many of those seated around me seemed to be simple celebrity spotters, there to see in the flesh the biggest-selling novelist in Arabic, Al Aswany, who is also an increasingly bold critic of President Hosni Mubaraks regime, which in Egypt has held power uninterruptedly for 27 years. The rest appeared to be aspiring writers or students eager for literary and political instruction. Austerely furnished with a single fluorescent light, half-broken chairs and a solitary table scarred with overlapping teacup rings, the room defused all expectations of literary glamour. Nevertheless, it offered a frisson of political danger. When the salon was held the previous year, Egyptian intelligence agents so intimidated the owner of the cafe where the meeting was taking place that he screamed at Al Aswany and his audience to go away. He later apologized, explaining that he had done it for the sake of the government spies who were watching him.",2008-04-27T04:00:00+0000

People who would not know if a page of Arabic is upside down or right side up helpfully expound upon the meaning of jahilliyah. Sayyid Qutb is quickly overtaking Reinhold Niebuhr as the theologian about whom the un- or antitheological pronounce with the most serene authority. Nothing creates intellectual confidence like catastrophe. After the mind breaks, it stiffens; in the aftermath of grief, it lets in only certainty. In a time of war, complexity is suspected of a sapping effect, and so a mental curfew is imposed.

We need to find substitutes to ward off this onslaught, which aims at children and young people whose personality is in the process of being formed. Although officials in Iran regularly denounce Western culture, Western toys have been popular there, and affluent parents often indulge their children with them. The prosecutor said, These toys, which do not respect the required norms, present dangers for the health of children and affect the survival of toy factories in this country. In July 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows went on sale in Tehran. Two years ago the police raided toy shops and put black stickers on the packaging of Barbie dolls to hide their bodies.

us,City Room: Lost World of the Fulton Fish Market,"""Row of Filleters,"" 1982. One of 37 images on display at the South Street Sea Port Museum by a Brooklyn-born artist. (Photo: Barbara Mensch, Courtesy Bonni Benrubi Gallery)  See a Slide Show  When the city closed the Fulton Fish Market in 2005, moving it to the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, it marked the end of a 183-year tradition of working-class life on the Manhattan waterfront. A new exhibition of photographs at the South Street Seaport Museum, by a photographer who devoted years to documenting the lives of the men who worked along the piers, pays tribute to that tradition, not long gone yet seeming already to be an element of the city's mythic past.   The 37 images in the exhibition, which opened on Saturday and is on view through December, are largely but not entirely drawn from ""South Street,"" which Columbia University Press published last year. The photographs in the book are drawn from a four-year period, 1979 to 1983, when Barbara G. Mensch, a Brooklyn-born artist who attended Hunter College and moved to the seaport area soon after, slowly managed to earn the trust of the fish workers, enabling her to compile an extraordinary portrait of waterfront life.   (Writing about the book last year, Sam Roberts of The Times noted that that way of life already seemed long vanished. ""Savoring the vivid faces in Ms. Menschs photographs, though, and reading her picturesque profiles of the loaders, lumpers and other workers, you can almost still smell the fish,"" he wrote.)  Attracted by what at the time was one of the city's more affordable neighborhoods, Ms. Mensch moved to an apartment near the seaport in 1979; she has never left.  Ms. Mensch, who grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, had studied drawing and earth sciences at Hunter, says she picked up a Rolliflex medium-format camera at the suggestion of an art instructor and began taking pictures of her mother, who was dying of cancer. Ms. Mensch's died in 1979, and her father in 1980.   The men of the seaport, she said, became a substitute family. ""There was a certain warmth and genuineness,"" she said. ""I dont know if its because of that old immigrant culture  primarily Italian or Jewish  where people care about you and want to make sure you're O.K. They would watch your back. They'd ask, 'Have you eaten enough?' One guy used to make me meatball sandwiches to take home because I was too skinny. Another would hand me a flounder that had fallen off a truck to take home.""  These were big tough guys, she emphasized: ""Their muscles were so enormous they could crush you like a bug. I was terrified the whole time. I look back on the things I did and the risks I took and I could never do it today. Theres no way.""  Eventually, photography became the main thrust of Ms. Mensch's artistic practice. The fish market became an enduring subject, which Ms. Mensch would visit again and again. Many of the images are not only of the physical environment, but also revealing portraits of the workers.   ""I caught the last wave of the old waterfront -- the bars, the flophouses,"" she said in a phone interview. ""The essence of the market was the old-timers, those amazing faces that come out at you.""   In 1985, she published ""The Last Waterfront: The People of South Street,"" a book of photographs and taped interviews, but today she views it as an early, inadequate work. ""The photographs in there were more illustrative of the market as opposed to the essence of my own artistic endeavor, which was to get into the soul of the place,"" she said. ""It wasnt really the story I wanted to tell. I was a kid. I was a bambino.""  Ms. Mensch is fascinated -- and saddened -- by what she views as the ""profound change in the urban landscape of New York,"" a change that is sweeping away so much of the city's past. Yet, she insisted, ""Its not about nostalgia. It's about what do we replace all these things were destroying with? Where are we going as a culture -- as a civilization - when we walk around and everything looks like interchangeable?""   Last year, around the time her book was published, the Museum of the City of New York approached Ms. Mensch, who is represented by the Bonni Benrubi Galley, about putting up an exhibition of her work. Mary Ellen Pelzer, the executive director of the South Street Seaport Museum, said that Susan Henshaw Jones, the president of the Museum of the City of New York, generously agreed to let the downtown museum have the show after Ms. Pelzer expressed interest.   ""The fish market has been so instrumental in the recent development of the region but also in the long history over the past two centuries,"" Ms. Pelzer said in a phone interview. ""Since our mission is to preserve and interpret the port of New York and the culture and commerce of it, this is perfect for us. More specifically, Barbaras work is so evocative of just what a working mans life was like in this district: the harsh environments, the difficult tasks, things that some people wouldn't really treat with respect and honesty.""  Thomas Mellins, who is curator for special exhibitions at the Museum of the City of New York and organized the exhibition of Ms. Mensch's photographs for the South Street Seaport Museum, said he went through hundreds of images for the show. He also included some of Ms. Mensch's more recent images of the seaport -- as recent as 2005 -- for the show. In a phone interview, he said he was struck by the haunting power of Ms. Mensch's photographs. He said:   I would say they are unflinching, but they go far beyond documentation. Its almost elegiac. It has great respect for people and places and the activities that are being portrayed. There certainly is an element of the old New York and the kind of reverence for the past that people often have, but at the same time, I would say that any sense of nostalgia is tempered by the harsh realities of the work that was conducted at the market. Its not a romanticized vision, but it is clear that this is a place that Barbara had a strong sense of tie to.   In an introduction to Ms. Mensch's book, the writer Phillip Lopate examines the market and what it meant for New York. He wrote:   Its obstinate prolonged existence points to one of the main paradoxes embedded in the city's character: for all that the image of Manhattan has rightly become identified in the world's imagination with modernity, its local population has often resisted technological upgrading and clung to provisions, stopgap work practices that become fixed through tradition.   The fish market used to be one of only several large commercial operations along the waterfront, but the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 ""sounded the death knell of the Fulton Market as an all-purpose emporium,"" Mr. Lopate wrote. ""No longer would housekeepers arrive daily from Brooklyn on the Fulton Ferry; instead, pedestrians and passengers would be deposited many blocks west, on Centre Street."" Construction of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the 1940s helped isolate the market even further, casting moody shadows over the market but also protecting it from developers who might otherwise have wanted to seize the valuable land, with its proximity to the Financial District.  The market where Alfred E. Smith had once toiled as a teenager seemed increasingly obsolete in an era of refrigerated trucks and air travel. Talk of relocating the market went as far back as 1956, when David Rockefeller, then the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, led a group of businesses that considered the future of Lower Manhattan. The city announced that the fish market would move to Hunts Point in 1969, but the subsequent fiscal crisis postponed such plans. The last trawler to dock at the fish market did so in 1979.   ""If the adjoining docks no longer served any function and the fish market was nothing more than a staging area for trucks, it could be located anywhere -- preferably near a major highway, with plenty of parking,"" Mr. Lopate wrote.   In 1983, the Rouse Company, a private developer, transformed much of the seaport area adjoining the fish market into a tourist-oriented recreational zone and placing more pressure on the commerce remaining in the area. The market's reputation for organized crime did not aid its survival.   In 1987, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States attorney in Manhattan at the time, announced the filing of a civil lawsuit seeking to seize control of the Fulton Fish Market on the ground that the Genovese crime family dominated it, driving up fish prices and improperly influencing the union of seafood workers. (At the time, Ms. Mensch was quoted in The Times saying she was upset about the racketeering accusations. ''These guys are out there shoveling fish carcasses,'' she said. ''They're as far from the Mafia as you can get.'')  In 1990, Ms. Mensch joined community residents who expressed opposition to the proposed rehabilitation of the Lettie G. Howard, a 19th-century fishing schooner that had been declared a national landmark. The residents supported the idea of restoration, but worried that the project would imperil the area's delicate balance of tourist, residential and maritime uses. ''If they have that big giant boat in there, in addition to the noise and the construction, it's another situation where the fish market cannot conduct its business,'' Ms. Mensch said at the time.   Lower Manhattan has gained residents since 9/11 -- against most expectations -- and the combination of residential growth and the desire to promote tourism meant that the fish market's days were numbered.   In 2004, as the city prepared to move the Fulton Fish Market to Hunts Point in the Bronx, Ms. Mensch was the subject of an About New York column by Dan Barry. Now I look at this place, and it's like death to me, she said at the time. There's nothing living.   Mr. Barry suggested that the seaport itself had become indistinguishable from other tourist-centered visitors' areas, comparing it to other tourist districts like Quincy Market in Boston and the Inner Harbor in Baltimore: ""Novelties on cobblestones, nothing more.""  Ms. Mensch's images, then, are a reminder of all that was lost. ""Mensch's photographs sometimes give the impression of dating from another, much earlier era, although she used no antiquing tricks to achieve that effect: it is simply that the tribe she portrays seems a throwback,"" Mr. Lopate wrote. ""Their faces and bodies express an almost ancient awareness of the price that must be paid to be a man, to hold one's ground, especially in a society less and less respectful of working-class culture.""

The Oprah Winfrey Show is promoting David Blaines appearance this Wednesday as a death-defying feat, which is not quite the way scientists (or Mr. Blaine) see his attempt to break the world record for breath-holding. Underwater breath-holding can lead to fatal blackouts if you do it without proper supervision, but Mr. Blaine will be carefully observed. Experts like Ralph Potkin, the pulmonologist who monitored Mr. Blaine during his training (which I described in my Findings column), say that prolonged breath-holds dont appear to cause harm to the body  at least not in the short term.

(One disadvantage: he and his father had to work on Christmas, even though the shop was nominally closed that day, because so many families were calling for help in setting up their new floor-level railroads.)Now Mr. Levinson, chairman of L&L Holding Company, is an owner of the former toy building at 200 Fifth Avenue.

He said he planned to visit Jordan soon to seek the return of more than 150 items. Dr. Muna Hassan, who heads a committee working to restore the artifacts, said similar discussions were in progress with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Italy. Between 3,000 and 7,000 items are believed to be missing, Laurent Levi-Strauss, a Unesco culture official, said last month. Syria said it arrested some of the traffickers but did not provide details.

By the time my mother was born, 10 years later, people were living in frame houses and had planted trees. When she was a child, nearly everyone she knew was from somewhere else, back East, all the way to Sweden, Norway or the Russian steppes. But by the time I spent childhood summers there, the place had become densely layered with human history of the sort so vividly depicted in the novel. It is the first place I heard people  the parents of a friend my grandmother disapproved of  described as shiftless, not likely to remain in the town for long.

In its decision, the court noted that the Port Authority, a bistate New York and New Jersey agency that owned the trade center, did not argue that the bombing was unforeseeable, only that it was unlikely, since its own consultants and an internal study group had predicted with exact prescience how an attack could be carried out.

Amy was a good writer and an excellent, tireless reporter who had an energetic mind that sought out new ideas. She loved the nostalgia piece; one of my favorite articles that I wrote for her at the Magazine was a profile of Jacques Tiffeau (a wild, brilliant guy and a lover of Diors, by the way). She saw the charm and evergreen news in those kinds of pieces. But Amy was also someone with strong moral beliefs and maybe that was the source of her contentiousness. She loved catching a fashion exec in a lie, and, of course, there was the heroin chic piece. You felt her rage, her high sense of standards. And she could REALLY yack during a fashion show. Amy would be talking away during a show and youd be looking at the clothes and going, Yeahahumyeahahum. Somehow, she saw everything. Her deputy at the mag, Andy Port, gave a marvelous speech at Amys memorial, which was held at the Rainbow Room. Amy had a knack, as Andy said, of persuading people to her side.
