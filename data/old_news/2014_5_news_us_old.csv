Indeed, this coral archipelago in the Indian Ocean, 23 miles off the eastern coast of Tanzania, still has many of the features that it did when it was an important trading center and its historic Stone Town served as the capital of an Omani sultanate. Zanzibars largest island, Unguja, is home to most of the cultural attractions, many of them found in beguiling Stone Town, which was awarded Unesco World Heritage status in 2000. In recent years, theres been a concerted effort to restore and give new life to the citys distinctive structures. Palaces have been turned into museums and cultural centers, and grand Swahili mansions have been reborn as restaurants and boutique hotels. Yet the coast still offers the delicious view that the explorer Sir Richard Burton recorded, of a cocoa-fringed shore of purest white, and the sea blue as a slab of lapis lazuli.

us,North Korea: Activity at a Missile Site," New commercial satellite imagery shows that North Korea is expanding its main rocket-launching site and testing engines of what is believed to be its first road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, a website specializing in the North said Thursday. The reported activities at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri near North Koreas western border with China come amid fears that the North may be preparing for another nuclear test. In recent days, more activity has been reported at an underground nuclear test site in Punggye-ri in northeastern North Korea. The website, 38 North, which is run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said its analysis of satellite images of Tongchang-ri showed that North Korea conducted one and maybe more engine tests of what is probably the first stage of a KN-08 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile in late March to early April. With this latest activity, three KN-08 rocket engine test series have been identified for the first and possibly second stages dating back to mid-2013, the website said. As this effort progresses, the next technically logical step in the missiles development would be a flight test of the entire system. ",2014-05-02T04:22:21+0000

Making its way to Germany as the Allies closed in, the train was intercepted by the Americans. Some of its cargo  jewelry, glassware, carpets, bed linen, cutlery, furs, furniture, gold coins, watches and much else from households whose occupants had vanished into the concentration camps  was subsequently commandeered by the generals working on the Marshall Plan, who needed to furnish their headquarters.

Roberts delivers all of this in the soothing, upbeat voice that has made her so formidable a presence on morning TV. Im no Pollyanna, she says in the current issue of Good Housekeeping, but I believe optimism is a choice  a muscle that gets stronger with use. Right foot, left foot . . . just keep moving.

Fred Dixon, the chief executive of NYC & Company, the citys marketing and tourism organization, says Brazilians average about a week per visit; a few who were in town last month can be seen on the following pages. Because of sky-high taxes on imported goods in Brazil, many there find that shopping sprees in New York can pay for themselves.

Clark started out as a maker of geometric abstractions under the influences of Klee, Mondrian and Lger. In the 1960s she was associated with Neo-Concretism, the Brazilian movement that insisted on the sensual and material  as opposed to intellectual  properties of paintings and sculpture, sometimes encouraging viewer interaction with objects and installations. After 1966, Clark claimed to have abandoned art. She shifted her approach away from creating conventional forms and toward a kind of art therapy that involved the application of materials and devices directly to the peoples bodies. Art was treated as a form of psychological healing. Her late works should be of particular interest to fans of socially engaged and otherwise participatory types of art making.

Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play the Fitzgeralds, R.V. enthusiasts with a teenage daughter who are beyond square, which is to say that they are stranger, kinkier and more interestingly individual than the Millers  and funnier as actors, too  Mr. Scott added.

That morning an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall, killing 13 Sherpa guides and leaving three missing  the highest death toll in a single day in the mountains history. This documentary covers the weeks leading up to the tragedy and the subsequent rescue and recovery efforts through real-time film footage and witness accounts. Among those interviewed are Mr. Ogwyn, above; Garrett Madison, the expedition leader; and Todd Burleson, the president of Alpine Ascents International, which lost five guides. It also pays tribute to the Sherpas and their families; the network will make a contribution to the American Himalayan Foundations Sherpa Family Fund, from which all donations will flow to relatives of the deceased. In Bear Grylls: Man vs. Everest, leading in at 8, Mr. Grylls presents stories of the greatest Everest attempts, using archival footage and interviews with climbers and support crews.

The films depiction of the raw fear lurking below the brothers braggadocio is the most pronounced emotion in a movie whose focus on the personalities of its criminals suggests an Australian answer to Goodfellas, minus the wiseguy humor, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.

Nomie Lvovsky portrays the queens lady-in-waiting; Virginie Ledoyen is the woman rumored to be the queens lover. If the rules and the players of this continuing, increasingly dangerous court intrigue remain obscure, its because Farewell, My Queen is told through Sidonies eyes, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Tapping her palace sources, notably an archivist (Michel Robin) and a dressmaker (Anne Benot), Sidonie learns of news known only to the nobility and their trusted stewards: that the Bastille has been seized. Mr. Jacquot, she added, has always been a sensitive director of actresses, his sympathies evident in his caressing, sometimes ogling camerawork and the time and space he gives women and their stories.

The rich, variegated colors are hand-dyed by Palmer using flowers, leaves and minerals; the jet-black hue comes from a dye recipe of roots, bark and indigo that dates back to medieval times. Each is one of a kind; custom designs are also available by special order. Palmer and Matson have set aside a small number of the blankets for T readers, and can ship overnight  just in time for a (very decadent) last-minute Mothers Day gift.",2014-05-07T14:44:52+0000

us,"Old, Good Things Seen Anew","A rarity among authors who focus on the relentlessly forward-looking profession of architecture, Witold Rybczynski is generally considered something of a conservative. Born in Scotland, educated in England and Canada and residing in Philadelphia, Mr. Rybczynski wrote in the introduction to his most recent book, How Architecture Works: A Humanists Toolkit (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), I consider history a gift, rather than an imposition. While a few of his 18 books are set firmly in the past, most, like the 1986 best-seller, Home: A Short History of an Idea, use a broad historical perspective to better frame the present. His writing has a patient, deliberate quality that is rare at a moment when the dominant medium of architectural discourse is Twitter. Perhaps this is why Mr. Rybczynski, despite himself, is suddenly all the rage. On May 1 he was named a Design Mind by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in its annual National Design Awards, an honor generally bestowed on visionary thinkers. On the same day he attended the National Magazine Awards as a nominee for three columns he wrote for Architect magazine in which he revisited significant buildings and neighborhoods that were completed many years ago to see how theyve stood the test of time.

Agent Is Questioned," The police questioned a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent under the countrys antiterrorism laws on Wednesday, two days after he was arrested on charges of possessing ammunition and knives as he tried to board a domestic flight.

The Associated Press said that Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington, confirmed that Mr. Cox was an F.B.I. employee on temporary assignment to provide routine assistance to the legal attach at the U.S. Mission in Pakistan. The local news media broadcast images of a handcuffed man wearing a blue and white striped shirt as he was taken to court on Tuesday. The images were reminiscent of the arrest of Raymond A. Davis, a covert security officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, in Lahore in January 2011 after he shot two Pakistani men at a busy intersection.

The companies were the only bidders in the latest phase of a decadelong effort to begin replacing the aging, white-topped helicopters that alight from the White House lawn. An earlier program run by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland of Italy collapsed in 2009 because of technical difficulties and billions of dollars in cost overruns, with President Obama complaining that it was an example of the procurement process gone amok. Industry officials said that AgustaWestland, Boeing and Bell Helicopter did not bid this time because they believed that the specifications favored a version of Sikorskys S-92 helicopter, which is smaller than most of its rivals. The new contract will cover the development of six aircraft. The Navy, which runs the program, is likely to eventually buy 21 helicopters. Sikorsky, which built the current presidential helicopters, is a unit of United Technologies. It will assemble the new aircraft in Stratford, Conn. Lockheed will install the mission systems in Owego, N.Y. ",2014-05-08T02:50:07+0000

us,Cradle of Civil Disobedience,"At the end of the 19th century, Mohandas Gandhi was a young lawyer living in Durban, South Africa. He left his house in Beach Grove every morning for an office on Mercury Lane, where he spent much of the day helping his fellow Indian immigrants navigate the onerous colonial bureaucracy. He kept meticulous records, including a logbook of correspondence  from an English missionary and local planters, and a series of letters exchanged with the Protector of Indian Immigrants about the treatment of indentured laborers. In January of 1897, and again a few months later, he heard from another lawyer who was, like him, a Gujarati who had studied in England and then struggled to establish a practice in Bombay. The contents of these letters are unknown. In a remarkable new biography, Gandhi Before India, Ramachandra Guha gingerly speculates about what they might have been. Expressions of support for Gandhis nascent activism? Or perhaps explorations of interest in a possible career in South Africa? Guha wisely stops there. What is not in doubt is the name in Gandhis logbook  M. A. Jinnah, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would become the founder of Pakistan. All we now know is that, a full 50 years before partition and the independence of India and Pakistan, the respective Fathers of those nations were in correspondence.",2014-05-08T20:52:51+0000

Delhi talks to itself about money  about what money can buy, about the cabinet minister pocketing kickbacks, about the suburban swatch of land that a lawyers untaxed, all-cash fee has purchased and, in near-reverential tones, about the ingenious and illegal ways more money can be made.

Mr. Brown, who is running for his fourth term this fall, has been pushing for the measure, which he says is the only way to bolster the states finances for the long term. Under the plan, spikes in money collected from capital gains taxes would be diverted to the fund, with some money set aside for debt payments on pensions. The Legislature would also be required to set aside 1.5 percent of general revenue for the fund each year, and money could be withdrawn from the fund only if overall revenue did not meet historic spending levels. The Legislature is expected to approve the proposal next week so that the measure can be placed on the November ballot. ",2014-05-09T01:59:46+0000

People came to socialize, to dance. After the game moved indoors around the 1950s, many courts that were not demolished became places for parking or storage. There is little nostalgia among the Irish for handball alleys, O Halloran says. I dont think people would value them the way they value a traditional cottage, old crosses or ancient ruins, he says.

They had lived there until July, when they were evicted and moved in with Anns mother in Sugarloaf, a more affluent township nearby. There was not much to miss about Hazleton, with its decaying downtown and its fading homes spotted with satellite dishes, but to Ann and Tom the town held a shimmering appeal: It had heroin, a lot of it. They had called the usual friends for a ride, with no luck, and their own car had been repossessed. So at midday, the two left Anns mothers condominium by foot and followed the asphalt out of the valley all the way to Hazleton. Eventually they turned onto Alter Street, where, especially in summer, heroin dealers greeted customers outside a packed barbershop and a busy pawnshop, clustering around them, competing for business. Sometimes Ann and Tom joined other users they knew behind a building, where someone had left a tattered couch. Sometimes they got high in an abandoned garage on a side street. Though the walk that day to Alter Street was long, it was worth it to them both: Tom, especially, loved heroin, and Ann loved Tom, and the march to Hazleton was as much about need as it was about love.",2014-05-09T14:45:22+0000

us,Inside the List,"Lifes Too Short: Greg Iless thriller Natchez Burning, about racism and murder in the Jim Crow South, is his first new novel in five years. Thats a long time between books for a writer whose previous best sellers arrived as regularly as the Olympics, every two years or so. But Iles has a good excuse. In 2011, when he was putting the finishing touches on an earlier version of Natchez Burning, he was in a car crash that tore his aorta, left him in a coma for eight days and resulted in the loss of his right leg below the knee. The accident, along with the death of his father a year earlier, inspired him to have another go at his novel. I realized that life was too short to pull any punches, Iles told The Greenville News in South Carolina earlier this month. I decided there was no room in this book for formula and fluff. The story had to be handled with appropriate gravitas. I had to deal with it not only the way it deserved but in a way that would make my father proud. The reworked Natchez Burning  which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 2  clocks in at almost 800 pages, and is the first of a planned trilogy. Among other things, it explores the role of social elites in allowing racism to thrive. The white lower middle class and lower class did not commit those acts of violence in a vacuum, Iles told The Greenville News. They had been given tacit approval by the upper levels of white society. Nor, he said, is such racism restricted to the past. Look at the scandal over the comments by the Clippers owner, he said, referring to Donald Sterling. The legacy of slavery is the greatest psychic wound in the American character. We still havent fully dealt with it, and I think itll take another lifetime to deal with it.",2014-05-09T15:56:24+0000

us,Whats On Sunday,"9 P.M. (NBC) ROSEMARYS BABY In this two-part remake of the 1968 Roman Polanski thriller, the director Agnieszka Holland transfers the setting from the Dakota on Central Park West to the Eighth Arrondissement of Paris, where Rosemary Woodhouse (Zoe Saldana, above) has moved with her husband, Guy (Patrick J. Adams), a writer with a teaching stint at the Sorbonne. Ms. Holland also transforms the dotty older couple next door, first played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, into French sophisticates (Carole Bouquet and Jason Isaacs) who offer the Americans their friendship and a spare apartment. This being Paris, they discuss the transaction in an elegant sex club. And when Rosemary, eager to get pregnant again after a miscarriage, visits an OBGYN, the examining room looks like the rare-books section of the Acadmie Franaise. Rosemarys Baby bends to current fashions, and, accordingly, is more straightforward and much gorier than the original film, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. But partly because the story has been so altered, it still has mystery and suspense. And because its Paris, it is possible to wonder, at least for a while, if maybe the problem is Rosemary, not her neighbors, who seem so serenely superior and all knowing. Part 2 will be shown on Thursday at 9.",2014-05-11T05:53:13+0000

Now its founder, Kevin Dolan, said that he had lined up what he called philanthropic investors to put up the money needed to finish construction. It is an unusual arrangement. Mr. Dolan said that the investors would become part owners of the building, which they would allow the Original Music Workshop, a nonprofit, to use rent-free. In the future they could then give their shares to the workshop, sell them to the workshop, or sell the building. Mr. Dolan, 62, said this would reduce the risk to people who might be reluctant to put money into a new organization without a long track record. He added that the space could open as soon as the fall of 2015.",2014-05-11T22:07:35+0000

So far, thats lead to such varied creations as atmospheric candles gilded in precious metals, high-performance skin-care creams and hand-ticked silk scarves depicting photographs of Havana shot by Murawczyk himself. The latest addition to the MiN oeuvre: a series of abstract fragrances, called Scent Stories, debuting this week. Composed of notes that normally dont land in eau, such as pencil shavings and ozone, the collection of 11 unisex scents took a year to develop with a master perfumer in Grasse, France. The idea was to make each scent like a chapter or a short story: it would be vivid, visceral and disconnected from the others, but take you somewhere, Yang says. Indeed, many of the fragrances were inspired by the pairs own memories and journeys. Dahab, for example, evokes the deserts and deep seas of Egypt where Murawczyk spent time. Its incense-y, smoky and mysterious, he says of the saffron-, cumin- and nutmeg-laced blend. Yang, who is also a trained reiki healer, is particularly drawn to Shaman, describing it as a futurist nomad scent, with a mystical air. The violet leaf note is especially nuanced, she says, and conveys a sense of clairvoyance.",2014-05-12T04:00:00+0000

(Cinemax) MAMA (2013) In this modern fairy tale directed by Andy Muschietti, the uncle (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) of two feral sisters (Megan Charpentier, above, and Isabelle Nlisse), abandoned by their father in the woods, moves them into a home with his goth girlfriend (Jessica Chastain). Then a grotesque figure the girls call Mama appears in the shadows and begins to wreak havoc on their lives. But is the monster simply a coping mechanism for dealing with tragedy? Or is Mama the essence of the girls dead mother? Instead of delivering buckets of guts and gore, this ghost story offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that dont often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you dont want anyone to take an ax to them, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. And while the director Guillermo del Toro, the reigning godfather of motion picture horror, is only an executive producer on the film, she wrote, it fits with the more successful movies hes signed on to. Mr. del Toro understands that nothing says terror like a home thats become a rattling cage. ",2014-05-12T04:17:00+0000

Its Rubys first solo show in Chelsea since he parked two menacing, rectilinear forms (a bus and a big brick of human-size cages) inside the Pace Gallery four years ago. This new show, entitled Sunrise, Sunset, presents a dense cross-section of recent works the prolific and controversial artist has produced in his fabled studio-cum-industrial-complex on the outskirts of Downtown L.A.  where only weeks ago, a Mack truck veered off the road and through the wall of the building, destroying a number of mammoth spray paintings and Rubys studio managers car (fortunately, no one was injured). Though the accident was a setback, the grandiose, unexpected destruction of the incident aligned well with Rubys expansive practice. The exhibition is full of charged objects, including Corinthian columns dripping with lustrous red polyurethane, a super-size canary-yellow electric chair, infernal stoves and bleached fabrics that evoke everything from Rorschach tests to the American flag. Here, the artist reflects on his intentions for the show and his place in the art world. ",2014-05-12T20:30:02+0000

These young women were often confined to their fathers homes in the rural villages where they lived; they would sneak calls to a Kabul-based poetry hotline to read their poems and exchange ideas with other Afghan women  parliamentarians, doctors, professors  whose lives they could only imagine.

In 2007, it came to light that the C.I.A. had destroyed videotapes of its interrogation sessions showing the use of the suffocation technique called waterboarding. The militarys practice of force-feeding detainees has been a major issue in habeas corpus lawsuits. The procedure involves strapping a detainee into a restraint chair and inserting a gastric tube through the nose and down the throat, through which liquid nutritional supplement is poured into the stomach. In February, a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia ruled that the courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges of the conditions of confinement at Guantnamo as part of habeas corpus lawsuits.

The duo, known for their knack for identifying new talent, originally looked to create the same neighborhood feel they had experienced when attending other global design weeks in London and Milan. However, by last year, the trials of securing real estate in a booming market had become overwhelming. In the end, it proved so difficult to find those spaces that we spent 80 percent of our time doing that, and zero percent curating, says Khemsurov.

Writing in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the lavish production  which helped to immortalize the famous greeting Dr. Livingstone, I presume  intelligent and restrained and dignified.

Mr. King and the producer Darryl Zanuck have made a picture that constantly fascinates the eye and stimulates the emotions in small, isolated ways, Mr. Crowther wrote in The Times. He added: The shots of wild animals in Africa  elephants, lions, rhinoceroses, giraffes and all manner of lesser creatures  are as magnificent and exciting as any yet, and the atmosphere and beauty of a safari under the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro are superb.

The riots were some of the worst civil unrest in recent years and appear to have prompted restraints on the local media by Vietnams authoritarian government. An article about the protests that was posted online by a Vietnamese state newspaper on Tuesday was removed by Wednesday morning.  The Chinese Embassy in Hanoi issued a notice on Wednesday that urged Chinese living in Vietnam to minimize unnecessary outings.  A staff member at the Chutex Garment Factory north of Ho Chi Minh City said 8,000 to 10,000 workers were involved in the rampage at his factory.  They burned the office, said the staff member who agreed to speak on condition that his name not be used. The rioters burned everything, all of the materials, computers, machines.  Police units and fire fighters arrived at the factory Tuesday and disbanded, the rioters, he said. On Wednesday morning police captured around 15 to 20 men who were attempting to loot the premises, he said.  The Chutex factory, located in Song Than Industrial Park 2 in southern Binh Duong Province, is described on its web site as one of the largest garment exporters in Vietnam. Chutex International, the parent company, was founded by a Taiwanese garment executive.  It is unclear why rioters targeted a factory linked to Taiwan.

Monthly data compiled by the energy agency, a 29-member group of oil importers, showed that Irans exports were 1.11 million barrels a day in April, down from 1.29 million barrels a day in March and 1.58 million barrels a day in February. The temporary accord specified that Irans monthly oil exports are not to exceed one million barrels a day on average for the six-month duration, and the excesses raised concern among critics of the accord that Iran was violating its terms. Obama administration officials have said they believe that Irans May, June and July exports will be lower. Under the accord, some Western economic sanctions were eased in exchange for a freeze on most of Irans nuclear activities, for the purpose of giving negotiators more time to reach a permanent agreement. Negotiators for the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany are seeking guarantees that Irans nuclear fuel cannot be used to make bombs. ",2014-05-16T03:03:41+0000

(Starz) CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) Tom Hanks, above, portrays Richard Phillips, the commander of the Maersk Alabama, an American container ship with a crew of 20 sailors and a cargo including supplies from the United Nations World Food Program, that was seized in the Indian Ocean in April 2009 by four armed Somalis. Barkhad Abdi, a first-time actor who received an Oscar nomination, plays Muse, their leader, whose actions lead to the arrival of the American military and its warships. The existential realities that inform contemporary Somali piracy turn out to be one of the unexpected themes of Captain Phillips, which begins as something of a procedural about men at work and morphs into a jittery thriller even as it also deepens, brilliantly, unexpectedly, into an unsettling look at global capitalism and American privilege and power, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this best picture nominee, adapted by the director Paul Greengrass from Mr. Phillipss book, A Captains Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea. Phillips is unambiguously a heroic figure, but hes scarcely the sole point of interest in a movie that steadily and almost stealthily asserts the agonized humanity of his captors.

us,Scandalous Women,"The publication of Gustave Flauberts Madame Bovary in 1857 and of mile Zolas Thrse Raquin 10 years later roused the French literary establishment against two previously unknown authors who had gone beyond the bounds of all that was held to be morally admissible in fiction with their portraits of adulterous women starved by marriage of sex and romance. The state prosecuted Flaubert for gross indecency, despite the terrible punishment he metes out to his wayward heroine. Zola was not subjected to the same ordeal, but critics treated him as a rogue purveying smut in the name of realism. Both novels have appeared in countless editions since the 19th century. Both have been adapted to the screen. Now they are available as audiobooks, read by two gifted English actresses: Madame Bovary by Juliet Stevenson and Thrse Raquin by Kate Winslet.",2014-05-16T16:25:30+0000

Both were fascinated by society high and low, by how people climbed or toppled from one rank to the other, and by how sex and money underpinned the entire system. Breakfast at Tiffanys, Capotes charming 1958 novella about a self-invented cafe society girl and the admiring writer who lives upstairs, is set during World War II. Most of the stories assembled in the recent Penguin anthology of OHaras New York stories were written in either the 30s or the 60s, but some are set decades earlier. And yet in the newly released audio recordings of the two books, maybe even more than on the page, the versions of New York that are evoked seem virtually interchangeable: Its a city of people on the make or else clinging to their former reputations, where everyone drinks too much, and where you can easily wake up in bed next to someone you barely remember meeting.",2014-05-16T16:26:04+0000

When it comes to immersing yourself in the First World War by audio, however, youll need more than a short commute. The war was very long, the books about it tend to be very long, and about this cataclysm that so thoroughly changed our world for the worse, surely you dont want to listen to merely one book?

Lee Rickard and Sean Bohrman, former bandmates in Thee Makeout Party!, started the Burger Records label in 2007 and opened a record store two years later; in that time theyve become the center of a scene thats generating excitement, loyalty and a sense of identity, especially among an Orange County contingent thats under the legal drinking age and hungry for local culture. Burgers pace has become manic lately  it released 300 items last year, between cassette-only editions or reissues and original albums on LP and CD  but it seems to be working: Burgerama, its annual two-day festival in Santa Ana, sold 10,000 tickets this year, and its bands (including Cherry Glazerr, Together Pangea, Audacity, the Garden and Gap Dream) have started to move onto the national radar.

Thats why I did this cookbook. The chef and owner of Los Angeless Fords Filling Station gastro pub (and son of Harrison Ford) has authored Taming the Feast (Simon and Schuster, $34.99), a how-to guide for bringing Game of Thrones-size banquets to your own kitchen table, whether youre serving a phalanx of friends or just a family of four. The idea of working with whole animals, trying to close that proximity between the back door of my kitchen and the farmland, the book came out of that, says Ford. Readers will have a difficult time finding another cookbook with both instructions for rigging a pig for vertical roasting and everyday backyard fare, like grilled beer-braised bratwurst or a simple safflower oil aioli. Alternative, more manageable recipes are offered for each feast  in case you, or your landlord, prefers that your paella come from a Weber or stovetop and not an inferno in the backyard. While such projects as sourcing cedar planks on which to roast sturgeon may sound complicated, for Ford the book is actually about getting back to basics; for instance, he teaches techniques like using ones hands for testing not only the doneness of meat, but also the temperature level over a fire. Says Ford, Im very much a touch, feel, smell kind of chef.",2014-05-20T13:00:49+0000

Perhaps the strangest shift is that Mr. Branagh, the wunderkind once considered Laurence Oliviers heir, is now directing Hollywood action movies (Thor). His is a complex, playful career that dabbles in many forms but always returns to what made him famous: Shakespeare.

The pilgrims were on their way to the shrine of a Shiite saint in Kadhimiya, in northern Baghdad, to commemorate the anniversary of his death. A day earlier, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki urged the security forces to protect pilgrims traveling to the shrine. The deadliest attack took place in the Ur neighborhood of eastern Baghdad, where a car bomb exploded near a tent for pilgrims, killing 14 people, including four children, security officials said. We need a new government that is able to protect us from those terrorists that are the enemies of God, said a man wounded in the Ur bombing, Jafar al-Musawi. An attack in central Baghdad by a suicide bomber killed 12 pilgrims and wounded 26, and in the western Baghdad neighborhood of Mansour, a car bomb killed nine people and wounded 20, officials said.

The photographer Alec Soth recently visited the Belle Plaine public high school, an hour outside Minneapolis, to witness its routine. When the principal announced that a lockdown was in effect, classroom doors were quickly locked; students who were in the middle of gym class moved to locker rooms and secured the doors behind them. For several minutes, they sat on the floor, heads lowered. It was pretty silent, Soth says. They were fairly nonchalant about the whole routine. Julie Bosman",2014-05-23T14:24:05+0000

A neurosurgeon, and also Feinstein Institutes president, Tracey had spent more than a decade searching for a link between nerves and the immune system. His work led him to hypothesize that stimulating the vagus nerve with electricity would alleviate harmful inflammation. The vagus nerve is behind the artery where you feel your pulse, he told me recently, pressing his right index finger to his neck.",2014-05-23T14:24:14+0000

The fact that language has musical attributes  rhythm, melody, tone  isnt much help when youre trying to express Bartok or Captain Beefheart in words. Even when music has lyrics, its essence is antilanguage, or at least in another language  and an inability to translate explains why so many album and concert reviews are unreadable.

us,By the Booker,"Edward St. Aubyn is that thing beloved by heritage series from the BBC, a man of ancient and aristocratic pedigree. He writes of an upper-class world so central to the English novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries, it has shaped the modern imagination: You might think we all sprang from big houses with handmade wallpaper and quietly smoldering servants. St. Aubyn cuts through the fantasy of privilege, however, with lacerating precision; once you have read his Melrose cycle of novels, there is no going back. These books  Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mothers Milk and At Last  set a marker in the English tradition by changing our view of what preceded them. The narrator, Patrick Melrose, is raped at the age of 5 by his sadistic, patrician father and later partially disinherited by his cold and foolish mother. After Melrose, the aristocratic novel, from Richardsons swooning Pamela to the affectless cruelties of Waugh, can never look the same again. ",2014-05-23T14:27:53+0000

That was partly because at that moment the Democratic Party controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, so there wasnt a dominant conservative politician to focus on; partly because of a wave of news media attention, notably an influential story on the Kochs political activities by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker; and partly because of the rise of the Tea Party movement, of which the Koch political apparatus was a primary backer. The conservative victories in the Congressional elections that fall looked like conclusive proof of the Kochs power.

In fact, she has just persuaded her parents to allow her to live in their vacation cabin in Californias Sierra Nevada for three months free and clear, so that she can bang . . . out her dissertation in economics. The 28-year-old, high-achieving Cress comes from cautious, stingy stock, a foundation that gives her a natural aptitude for her field: Her father is a traumatized victim of the Great Depression, and his fears and obsessions had imprinted her with thought patterns that, superficially at least, were indistinguishable from the mind-set of a trained economist: What is given up to get this?

But a person can spend only so many hours a day inventing gruesome murder schemes, and one of the ways Deaver likes to unwind is by breeding show dogs with a business partner near his North Carolina home. Im not as creepy as the things I write about, he told The Associated Press in 2007. That doesnt mean you cant question his priorities  he once passed up dinner with Angelina Jolie to tend to a dogs matted coat. But Deaver knows what hes doing: His briards have won Best of Breed more than once at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York. Your hearts pounding, he told a reporter in 2005, comparing the experience to that of a father watching a Little League game. Youll still love the dog just as much if he doesnt win. But I cant help it. I hope he wins. Given the elaborate plot twists and psychological head games in his novels, is Deaver ever tempted to mess with his dogs minds, just a little?

(Cinemax) THE WORLDS END (2013) In the summer of 1990, five British teenagers set out on a pub crawl in the town of Newton Haven, vomiting, fighting and having drunken sex along what is known as the Golden Mile. But they failed to make it through the 12 requisite watering holes, the last of which was called the Worlds End. Twenty years later, they give it a second try in this comedy directed by Edgar Wright, the final installment in his Cornetto Trilogy, following Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Paddy Considine, along with Martin Freeman and Eddie Marsan, play the Golden Milers. Four have traded their wild youth for adult respectability; the fifth decidedly has not. Then the robots show up, and these men just may be humanitys only hope for survival. The Cornetto Trilogy is named after a popular ice cream treat, and the buzz of The Worlds End is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end  no Hangover, in other words. Ill drink to that.",2014-05-24T05:00:01+0000

One possible explanation is that Jewish converts to Catholicism in the 17th century switched to a name that would clearly distance them from their Jewish past and reduce the risk of further persecution. Another is that a local clerk mistakenly changed mota, or hill, into mata, or kill. ",2014-05-27T02:13:27+0000

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a first lung sample from the Illinois man had tested negative for the coronavirus that causes MERS, but two preliminary blood samples had then tested positive for antibodies to it. That led the C.D.C. to announce on May 17 that the man had been infected but had not fallen ill; this would have been the first transmission of the virus within the United States. On Wednesday, they said that a more sensitive blood test that takes at least five days to produce results showed that he never had the virus. The most likely explanation, one of the officials said, is that the preliminary test had cross-reacted with antibodies the man had to a previous coronavirus infection. At least six coronaviruses are known to infect humans: Four normally cause common cold symptoms, while the other two, MERS and SARS, are more serious. Only two MERS cases have been found in the United States  the Indiana man and another in Florida. Both had recently arrived after working in Saudi hospitals where there have been hundreds of cases since March. Thus far, C.D.C. officials said, extensive testing indicates that the two men did not pass on the virus to any family members or health care workers treating them. ",2014-05-29T00:37:51+0000

The Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices said the group contributed about $2 million to that campaign but did not register with the commission as a ballot committee, in violation of election law. The organization has argued that its donors did not specifically earmark contributions for the campaign and so it did not have to make disclosures about them to the commission. It said it would appeal. The fine is the highest imposed by the ethics board, which will also direct the group to register as a ballot question committee and to list its contributions.

(Starz Cinema) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance (Before Sunset) in Paris that began nine years before that (Before Sunrise) in Vienna, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke, above with Ms. Delpy) are now in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), the son he left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with Hank. Celine sees his question as a demand to make it happen. And so they will fight about this  and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women  throughout the course of a day.

us,Online Chats Between Sexes Denounced in Saudi Arabia," A senior Saudi Arabian cleric has issued an edict against online chatting between the sexes, equating such activity to the prohibitions on the physical mingling of unrelated men and women, the news agency Al Arabiya  reported Thursday. It said the cleric, Sheikh Abdullah al-Mutlaq, a member of the Saudi Committee of Senior Scholars, had warned that such conversations were religiously forbidden and might lead to sin. Al Arabiya quoted the cleric as saying the devil would be present when women talk to men on social media network sites. It was unclear how seriously the clerics declaration would be enforced in Saudi Arabia, where roughly half the population of 27.3 million are Internet users, an estimated six million use Facebook, and online chat forums appear to be common. Social media for political messaging in Saudi Arabia is strictly forbidden, however. Reporters Without Borders, a press freedom advocacy group, has classified Saudi Arabia as among the most repressive countries in a global ranking on news and information censorship.

Bush while they were in office to an inquiry panel looking into the Iraq war. The agreement between the government and the inquiry, led by John Chilcot, will allow publication of some selected quotations from Mr. Blairs exchanges with Mr. Bush, but will not include any of Mr. Bushs replies, Mr. Chilcot said in a letter to Jeremy Heywood, the British governments top civil servant. Detailed consideration of gists and quotes requested by the inquiry has now begun, and quotations will be kept to the minimum necessary to enable the inquiry to articulate its conclusions, Mr. Chilcot said. The deal comes after months of deadlock over what would be released; the report is expected to be published before the end of the year. At issue are about 25 written notes from Mr. Blair to Mr. Bush and more than 130 records of conversations. The inquiry was set up in 2009 and was expected to report in 2010.

My Life in Cartoons, which is not just a charming memoir but also a charming grab bag of cartoon history, cartoon theory (nothing too woolly) and shoptalk. The title is taken from Mankoffs best-known drawing. Businessman on phone, consulting datebook: No, Thursdays out. How about never  is never good for you? As its author points out  false modesty is not one of his faults  that line has entered the vernacular, alongside other classics from the magazine such as I say its spinach, and I say the hell with it (drawing by Carl Rose, caption by E.

us,The Dark Side,"Robert Louis Stevensons The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an oblique and artful Gothic tale framed as a detective story. The truth seeker is Jekylls lawyer, Utterson, the books most prominent character. Jekyll  the gentleman who dabbles in chemical self-transformation  appears only intermittently, never fully speaking for himself until the end, when he discloses the details of the disastrous experiments that unleashed his primitive alter ego. The novel isnt a conventional horror story, lingering on the macabre for its own sake, but an allegory of the divided self, perhaps also a meditation on addiction. Stevenson dramatizes human duality but doesnt analyze its causes, treating it as pervasive and fundamental. For him, the Jekyll-Hyde split is the split in all of us, between the animals we evolved from and the angels we aspire to be.",2014-05-30T14:36:32+0000

us,Travel,"Paul Bowles observed that an important difference between a tourist and a traveler is that the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking. This difference also separates writers about travels from travel writers. Is the voyaging writer telling us canny stories from a romping trip or using his peregrinations to relocate his place in the world? Sometimes its difficult to tell. D. H. Lawrence knocked off travel essays about places in which he had arrived only a few hours before, but he was writing about himself and his intuitions. Bowles, for his part, lived for years in Morocco but traveled through the desert with a suitcase filled with his favorite neckties. Do we read either man for profound and meticulously earned insights about Sardinia or the Sahara, or for their ability to convey something about themselves as they pass through those places? Most writers are passing through, and we expect no more of them. Its part of their charm, if they have any.

us,Street Life,"The flneur, that feature of the 19th-century urban landscape, stood apart from the city as a wide-eyed wanderer. But when he had a camera in his hands, he became the archetypal street photographer, a curious observer who captured his environment in what Henri Cartier-Bresson called its ""decisive moments: spontaneous, serendipitous, intuitive, singular. In Unfamiliar Streets: The Photographs of Richard Avedon, Charles Moore, Martha Rosler, and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, the art historian Katherine A. Bussard explores the genre of street photography, beginning with this dominant definition and then expanding it. The photographers she investigates, whose work here spans the 1940s through 2001, manipulate the viewers imagination of the city, or change the way viewers act within it. According to Bussard, accurately representing experiences of city streets involves addressing issues of gender, commerce, race, collectivity, class, dispossession, sexuality and spectacle. In other words, street photography isnt only the magic of capturing a well-composed slice of life; its the more complex task of recapitulating or intensifying the economic, class and gender tensions of the city street within an image. The image should galvanize the viewer or, ideally, alter street life as its lived simply by the fact of the image having been made.",2014-05-30T14:41:23+0000

Or, You wouldnt confuse me with Thomas Merton, theyll say, referring to the Trappist monk and mystic. Kneeling bags my nylons. The best of these self-conscious comparisons may come from James Thurber, who was once asked to review Salvador Dals autobiography. Comparing his own golden-hued Columbus, Ohio, upbringing with young Dals chiaroscuro of ermine capes and necrophilia, Thurber wrote, The naked truth about me is to the naked truth about Salvador Dal as an old ukulele in the attic is to a piano in a tree, and I mean a piano with breasts.",2014-05-30T14:45:16+0000

With the arrival of Twitter, Reichl added another genre to her rsum: haiku-like paeans to breakfast in any weather: Sunny in Charlotte. Returned to rain. Gray New York morning. Big bowl of ginger strewn congee. Chiles. Soy. Scallion. So consoled. The next day, it was still raining, but once again food came to the rescue: Gray drizzle. Umbrellas up. Sidewalks sloppy.

Riding the rails to Boston in 1924, George Gershwin listened to the roar of the steam engine and the turn of the wheels and found the inspiration for Rhapsody in Blue, his hymn to urbanizing, Jazz Age America. It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its rattle-ty bang, that is so often so stimulating to a composer, he told a biographer, describing the moment of creation. I frequently hear music in the very heart of the noise. W. C. Handy and other African-American musicians heard a similar sound on the Illinois Central, the Midwestern line that spirited them away from the Deep South on the Great Migration that began during World War I. They married the whistle and drone of the locomotive to the plaintive chants of sharecroppers and invented the city blues. Steve Goodman, a little-known composer, was inspired by a journey on the same line to write a dirge that became one of the anthems of the Vietnam War era  The City of New Orleans.",2014-05-30T14:53:43+0000

Freds views filtered down to at least one of his four sons: Charles, the second-oldest and now the chief executive of Koch Industries, spent most of a blind date in the early 1960s railing against the evils of Communism, according to the biography. (I ended up leaving early and walking home, his date says.) Charles also let his politics spill over into literary criticism.
