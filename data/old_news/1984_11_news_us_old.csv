us,THE POLISH RIDDLES,"''There are many riddles in the case,'' said Jerzy Urban, the Polish Government's chief spokesman, as he discussed the investigation into the slaying of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko. Essentially, the specifics of the case as it has emerged are that on Oct. 19, as the 37-year-old pro-Solidarity cleric was returning to Warsaw after preaching at a church in Bydgosz, the car he was riding in was stopped by three men in a second car. The priest's friend and driver, Waldemar Chrostowski, was said to have later told the police that he was blindfolded, gagged, handcuffed and pushed into the car. He said he heard the priest say, ''Gentlemen, what are you doing?'' This was followed by a thud and the sound of weight being thrown into the trunk. Mr. Chrostowski said he managed to pry up the door latch and rolled out of the moving car, escaping into the night. According to Government sources, the abductors sent a ransom note to church officials. Shortly thereafter, investigators focused attention on Gregorz Piotrrowski, a captain in the Interior Ministry department that is reportedly charged with monitoring the activities of priests. The captain had reportedly forged an entry in a log book in his official car. Traces of the priest's hair were found in the trunk, and the captain was detained with two associates in the ministry's security services, Lieut. Wlademar Chmielewski and Lieut. Leszek Pekala. Questioning of the suspects led investigators to a reservoir near Wloclawek, where the priest's body was discovered by divers last Tuesday.",1984-11-03T05:00:00+0000

The committee, formed after the American Civil Liberties Union had filed a list of complaints, found that most of the charges were groundless, including accusations that starting assignments had been made on the basis of players' religious beliefs; that athletic scholarships had been withdrawn because prospects were not Christians, and that one coach had told players they couldn't play on his team unless they played on ''God's team.''",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,ORGAN TRANSPLANTS GROW IN NUMBERS AND SUCCESS,"Thirty years after a Harvard team of physicians removed a healthy kidney from a man and transferred it to his twin brother, doctors continue to conduct dramatic and controversial experiments in human transplants. Removing the heart of a living baboon and implanting it into an infant named Baby Fae in California nine days ago is the latest breakthrough. In recent years, doctors have transplanted the lungs, heart-and-lung combinations, the small intestine, and even a uterus, among other organs. But behind the risky work on the scientific frontiers, something at least as remarkable is taking place in the medical mainstream. The number of transplants of hearts, livers, kidneys, corneas and other organs has been growing rapidly in the past few years, and the operation is becoming a standard medical procedure in desperate cases.60,000 KidneysExperts at the National Center for Health Services Research estimate that more than 60,000 kidneys have been transplanted in the world in the past two decades. The center counts roughly 5,300 bone marrow transplants worldwide, and it says that doctors have also transplanted more than 700 livers and 400 pancreases and roughly 800 hearts. Heart transplants, which made headlines in the 1960's but proved so ineffective that most medical centers stopped performing them, have returned to favor. Early this year, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, one of the heart transplant pioneers, resumed the operation after a 14-year layoff. ''We're at the low end of an upward swing'' in organ transplants, says Kenneth Goodman, executive director of the American Council on Transplantation, a private group that seeks to increase the supply of available human organs.",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Jack Sawyer is the boy, his scarecrow is an old black man named Speedy Parker, his cowardly lion is a cheerful werewolf and the Tin Woodman is his human but ultra-rational cousin Richard. The yellow brick road may be U.S. 40, while Oz is a quaint country known as the Territories, to which Jack learns to travel far more easily than by tornado over a rainbow. The talisman, the object off his quest, is the Wizard. Unlike the Wizard, the little crystal ball is not a fraud but ''the axle of all possible worlds'' with which Jack's mother, a former Sandra Dee-type actress known as the ''Queen of the B's,'' and her ''twinner,'' the Queen of the Territories, will be able to rise from their deathbeds. There is no Toto, but to make up for that there are two wicked witches. Stephen King and Peter Straub must have had fun with their collaboration, not least by making digs at other authors. The evil evangelist is named Sunlight Gardener, the worst man in the hellish town of Oatley is Smokey Updike, and Jack starts out at a creepy hotel in New Hampshire. There are quantities of blood and of worms crawling out of things, and of each character's verbal tag tacked to every utterance - ''Yeah-bob,'' ''Right here and now,'' ''God pound his nails,'' ''Can you gimme hallelujah,'' - until you could hum them in your sleep.",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Much later, in our own day, the same lofty site precluded the building of railroad tracks (the station is down in the valley), superhighways, shopping centers and other similar blessings of the modern age. So the city has remained much as it was in the late Middle Ages, when it became part of the Pontifical States.

When the players agreed to a draw on the 31st move of the 21st game of the series on Friday, they were registering the 12th draw in a row, extending the record for consecutive draws in world championship play. Karpov leads the series 4 to 0, but one now wonders whether he will ever score the two more victories needed to win the match; draws do not count. This 21st game was a pretty much uneventful performance by both players. True, Kasparov expedited his development with a little gambit, but Karpov refused it to resume business as usual, and neither side ever got the upper hand. The same Queen's Gambit Declined variation as in the 19th game made its appearance, but this time Kasparov, probably fearing some prepared analysis by Karpov's team, eschewed his earlier sharp 7 . . . N-B3 in favor of 7 . . . PxP. This allowed Karpov to advance 8 P-K4 without hindrance, but Kasparov was equally free to strike back at the white center buildup with 8 . . . P-B4. The champion did not try to seize the gambit pawn offered by 12 . . . O-O!, since 13 QxP, B-N5! will recover the material with a good game. Thus, 14 O-O, BxN; 15 PxB, B-B5 threatens 16 . . . Q-R5! as well as 16 . . . NxP. After the exchange of queens with 13 . . . QxQ; 14 BxQ, the resulting ending was quite even: White had the better centralized piece placement, but his KP was slightly fragile and Black had the bishop-pair.",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Scavullo's celebrities, dramatically posed, lighted and cropped to catch the eye, are presented in large prints, including one floor-to-ceiling blowup. Nixon's 8-by-10-inch contact prints are no larger than is usual nowadays in museum and gallery exhibitions, and his otherwise unknown old people, photographed apparently unposed in the settings of their everyday lives, are shown in a neutral light that seems to do no more (or perhaps I should say no less) than reveal them as they actually are.

Writing in these pages last year, Stanley Kauffmann called the migration of European intellectuals and artists to America during the Hitler era ''the largest transfusion of talents from one culture to another in Western history.'' Anthony Heilbut's ''Exiled in Paradise'' is devoted to those men and women, from Hannah Arendt and Bertolt Brecht to Kurt Weill and Stefan Zweig, what they came from and their experiences here. Mr. Kauffmann praised Mr. Heilbut's ''passionate concern. If he picked up a heavy load which sometimes makes him spill a bit or stumble, he marches on with fervor.'' A MAN AND TWO WOMEN, by Doris Lessing. (Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) These are stories, set in England and South Africa, dealing with sexual and romantic involvements. Our reviewer, Stanley Kauffmann, taking note of Doris Lessing's ''The Golden Notebook'' which came out in 1962, a year before ''A Man and Two Women,'' said, ''Most of these 19 stories are the work of the author she has already shown herself to be - a mature and valuable artist, adventurous in the mysteries of daily life, thoughtful, passionate, true.''",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Representatives Peter W. Rodino Jr. of Newark, Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, Joseph P. Addabbo of Queens and a dozen other senior members of the region's delegation are expected to continue to wield influence in Washington. Does their power make re-election all but certain? Or has their popularity in their districts earned them the seniority needed to win power in Congress? ''A mixture of both, I guess,'' Mr. Rangel said. Other politicians and political experts agree, saying that while it is difficult to separate cause and effect, there is little doubt that both create the conditions for Congressional authority. As Democratic chairmen of committees and subcommittees in the Democratically controlled House, power brokers often decide the fate of legislation. They are courted by lobbyists and political action committees eager to contribute even to re- election campaigns that are contests in name only. A chairman's power and resources, including patronage, can scare off potential opponents. Party leaders have even been known to acknowledge - behind the scenes, to be sure - that a committee chairman from an opposing party can do more for a district and its local politicians than a freshman representative from one's own party. Senior representatives are seldom subject to election-day jitters. Mr. Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, routinely gets 85 percent of the vote. Mr. Rangel, the fourth-ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, does even better.",1984-11-04T05:00:00+0000

A connoisseur, collector and dealer, he helped to expand the interest in African and Oceanic art in this country. He was also a yoga practitioner, a linguist, an amateur anthropologist and a mystic.

''But the decline occurred largely because of the sharp drop in auto sales that month,'' Mr. Popkin noted, ''and not because the consumer is overburdened with installment debt.'' Continuing labor problems again depressed domestic auto output in October, causing sales to fall to an annual rate of 6.9 million units, from 7.9 million in September. As a result, Mr. Popkin expects sluggish growth in installment debt to continue in October. But the trend should reverse in the final months of the year.

He was aware, he said, that these choreographers were trying to deal with such elements in a dissociated way that would keep them from being accused of being old-fashioned. But implied in his point was the idea that the modernist revolution (manifest in modern-dance in the 1930's and 1940's) had already introduced nonlinear presentation of emotion and storytelling.

The professor discussed ectopic pregnancy, toxemia, spontaneous abortion and major birth defects. I was eight months pregnant. I sat there, rubbing my belly, telling my baby: ''Don't worry, you're O.K., you're healthy.'' I sat there wishing that this course would tell us more about normal pregnancy, that after memorizing all the possible disasters, we would be allowed to conclude that pregnancy itself is not a state of disease. But I think most of us, including me, came away from the course with a sense that pregnancy is a deeply dangerous medical condition, that one walks a fine line, avoiding one serious problem after another, to reach the statistically unlikely outcome of a healthy baby and a healthy mother.",1984-11-11T05:00:00+0000

This is a large-format book with hundreds of photographs, drawings and old advertisements. Our reviewer, William Cole, said last year that Stuart Berg Flexner ''shows us how our society has changed old words and wrought new ones.'' He is ''not a grammarian but a derivation detective.'' And ''Listening to America'' is ''a big browse of a book and, incidentally, beautifully indexed; slip it into the reference shelf after savoring.'' WALTZ IN MARATHON, by Charles Dickinson. (NAL, $6.95.) This 1983 story by a Chicago newspaperman is about a 62-year-old loan shark, Harry Waltz, a rich wid ower with children, and the surprise he and his lover, a 42- year-old attorney, feel when she becomes pregnant. Julian Moynahan wrote in The Book Review that ''Waltz in Marathon'' is ''an arresting first novel.'' The strength of Charles Dickinson's narrative ''lies in its authenticity. Eastern Michigan's fierce winters of fog and ice, the miseries and satisfactions in the daily affairs of ordinary people, the distinctive and essentially egalitarian social patterns of a long-established and important American region are rendered realistically and vividly but not without humor and surprise.''",1984-11-11T05:00:00+0000

''I'm still pinching myself,'' said Mr. Garn, who has been jogging 20 to 25 miles a week to keep ''in physical shape so there would be no question.'' As a Navy pilot and later an Air National Guard officer, the 52- year-old Senator has logged more than 10,000 hours aloft - more than all but one astronaut. Perhaps more to the point, Mr. Garn is head of the subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees NASA, and the agency will be asking Congress next year for more seed money for its $8 billion space station program and for added funds to improve the shuttle's reliability.",1984-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Mondale, was a solid political figure, so he clearly did not win by being perceived the lesser of two evils.

But by midcentury these histories had lost their appeal. Rough treatment at the hands of professional historians had something to do with their fate, but events also played a part. World War II had made a mockery of H. G. Wells's optimistic vision of ''man rising from lonely beginnings to this present dawn of world fellowship,'' but the victory and survival of the Western democracies had also discredited the doomsayers who had predicted the decline of the West.

In this posthumous collection of stories, fey mortals and all-too-mortal fairies abound. Of the 20 pieces - several of which appeared in The New Yorker over the past 40 years - most concern themselves with the real world; the rest take place in the imaginary, politically sensitive Kingdoms of Elfin. Whether writing naturalistically about village life in England, or fantastically about the destinies of elves, Sylvia Townsend Warner (who wrote in a wide variety of genres, including poetry) works her curious trick of showing how one thing does indeed lead to another, often in the most alarming way. ''Some Effects of a Hat'' is typical: an American tourist leaves his homburg behind in a chance encounter with an unmarried, unpopular woman living in Devonshire. Expecting him to come back for it and unwilling to let the expensive hat sink into the oblivion of daily neglect like ''the inexplicable key on the bathroom window sill, the dog-eared packet of wallflower seed behind the parlour clock,'' the woman keeps it spruced and ready on the table near her front door. Her hostile neighbors get suspicious of a man's hat (''It's been moved a good inch to the right since I saw it last Tuesday''), and she is eventually driven out of town, only to end up in Derbyshire and a new life. Warner's effects are especially delightful when characters appear in several stories.",1984-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,OUTDOORS: PACKING UP TACKLE,"This is perhaps the most propitious time for those who live in the Northeast to attend to fishing gear that lies where it was tossed on the day the last cast was made. This is not to say that, for all anglers in the region, their sport is over for the year. In the ocean, bluefish and striped bass are still about and codfishing never seems to end, and in some states one may go after such species as black bass, yellow perch and lake trout through this month and more. There are also, of course, certain trout streams, such as the no-kill sections of the Beaverkill and Willowemoc in the Catskills, where one may fish year-round. All I am suggesting is that, if one is truly done with angling for the season, one should pay proper attention to his gear. Some anglers don't quit until the season for the species sought has closed, or, as in the case of the bluefish and striped bass, until the fish have moved away. Others follow a self-imposed closure schedule. I stop in late October, preferably after a particularly successful morning or evening so that I can savor my recollection of that time in the frozen months ahead. This ritual is sometimes difficult to honor, as it was the past few days, when friends persisted in telling me of the superlative surf fishing for striped bass that was less than 20 miles from my home.",1984-11-12T05:00:00+0000

At dawn, the Government forces raided a poor Santiago neighborhood that has witnessed many clashes and demonstrations against the military Government. The Government forces occupied the slum for seven hours, searching house to house, and then bused or trucked virtually all males over 16 years old to the stadium. (Page A1, Column 1.) A desire to move promptly into talks with Moscow on ways of resuming arm control negotiations was repeated by the Reagan Administration. It said it was eager to ''flesh out'' its plan for so-called umbrella talks with the Soviet Union. At the same time, officials said that negotiations on a new agreement for cultural exchanges were snagged over the issue of possible defections by Soviet participants.

us,THE HOUR THAT AMTRAK'S MIND LEFT THE RAILS,"I'm probably the last person to tell Amtrak how to run its business. After all, the federally subsidized passenger railroad cost the Government only $2.15 billion over the last three years. And the line hasn't suffered a derailment or head-on collision for some weeks now. Still, after my excursion from Baltimore to New York the night of Oct. 27-28, I felt that Amtrak was getting some bad advice somewhere, and that even a rank amateur could offer a pointer. Meredith Platt is a graduate student in biopsychology at Hunter College. The subject is scheduling. As an alert reader may already have noted, Oct. 28 is the night we all turned the clocks back from Daylight Savings Time to Eastern Standard Time. As our sleek Amtrak coach hurtled through the night toward New York, we had no inkling of the extraordinary experience that lay ahead - in time, not space. Sure, there had been that unexplained burst of fireworks near Wilmington. But that hardly prepared us for the surprise that Amtrak held in store. You see, Amtrak takes very seriously our great annual ritual called The Turning of the Clock. At precisely 2 A.M., all over the country, Amtrak trains hit the air brakes, pulled over and stopped. For one hour, thousands of passengers and crew silently waited while Daylight Savings Time became Eastern Standard Time. We ''fell back'' together.",1984-11-17T05:00:00+0000

In responding to written questions submitted by an NBC News correspondent, Mr. Chernenko also said that if the Reagan Administration was sincere, the way was open to resolving key arms-control questions. (Page 1, Column 6.) Salvadoran rebels eased their policy of refusing to participate in elections until they gain a formal role in the Government, one of the rebel leaders said. He said they are prepared, in principle, to take part in elections organized by the Government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. (1:3.)",1984-11-17T05:00:00+0000

It saw him admired as one of Europe's great lovers; and yet from the beginning he had a mystical, religious bent. It saw him vain and spoiled, yet extraordinarily kind and helpful to his colleagues. He made a big thing about being Hungarian, but could never speak the language. A complicated man, Franz Liszt, and there have been those able to see only one side of his profile.

Low Mountain is remote, even by the standards of the sparsely populated, 21,400 square-mile Navajo reservation; winter snowstorms and spring mudslides can make impassable the deeply rutted dirt roads linking the region to the rest of the world.",1984-11-18T05:00:00+0000

So did fund-raising efforts by their defenders. Controversy is a constant on the seven-member court's docket. Twice in the last 12 months it has stirred conservative anger with rulings that knocked initiative measures off the ballot. One was a reapportionment proposal backed by most Republicans, who wanted to replace the 1982 Democratic redrawing of boundaries for legislative and Congressional districts. The court ruled that the state's constitution allowed only one reapportionment every 10 years, and the Democrats' bill had used up the quota for the 1980's. On Aug. 27, the court tossed out another initiative that, if approved, would have directed the Legislature to petition Congress to call a Constitutional Convention on an amendment to require an balanced Federal budget. The court's reasoning was that only the Legislature is empowered to petition Congress; therefore, it would be improper to allow Californians to consider withholding legislators' salaries until the petition was filed, as the initiative provided.",1984-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT,"Queen Elizabeth has arrived in San Francisco; just as Mary Ann Singleton, television reporter, goes to cover the scene, one of the Queen's officers jumps ship. Mary Ann's husband, Brian, doesn't know that he's infertile, but Mary Ann does, so she decides to. . . . Thus begins ''Babycakes,'' and the fourth installment of Armistead Maupin's San Francisco saga careens beautifully on. People who haven't read his ''Tales of the City,'' ''More Tales of the City'' and ''Further Tales of the City'' might initially be confused by the plethora of characters, but they should continue. ''Babycakes,'' unlike the ''Tales,'' preserves a sense of irony while making paramount the values of warmth and love. Almost a decade into their promiscuous but caring friendships, the characters are tempered by age and wisdom, though still layered in reflecting, intermittently revealing levels of absurdity. Gestures have a life of their own - an ''Elizabethan'' wave of the hand, for example, belongs first to the Queen, then to a socialite, then to Mona, a mail-order lesbian bride, making equal the essentially unequal. If British high life and low life don't come across as different from San Francisco's, who cares? Credit, as Mr. Maupin does, ''the global village,'' or suspend disbelief and concentrate on the mostly deft twists and turns of plot. ''Babycakes'' seethes with pleasantly nasty topical references and has been likened by the over-enthusiastic to Dickens's Victorian melodramas and to Wodehouse's cheerful fables. Mr. Maupin's style, though, with all its near-perfect ear (''crumbling umber castle''), is still too alienated and grotesque for many, and Babycakes herself - Mary Ann - isn't central enough to function as a proper picaresque heroine.",1984-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Three centuries of scientific literature, all anecdotal, have had her biting off the head of an amorous male, thus triggering some rather satisfactory automatic reflexes on his part. Having had her fill of pleasure, the story went, she then had her fill of him, as dinner. A neurophysiologist named W. Jackson Davis says, however, that the female praying mantis is actually no more lethal than a saucy wench. Mr. Davis, according to The Washington Post, put 30 pairs of males and females in laboratory cages, trained video cameras on them and waited for the decapitations. Instead, a frame-by-frame analysis revealed a courtship ritual that is, he said, ''a lovely thing to see.'' Some females, in fact, encouraged their suitors by what in another species would be called knee-tickling.",Thus Mr. Davis destroys one more stereotype of the deadly female.

The last local members of a family that could be traced back to the 12th century, the Luxtons were seen by their neighbors in the village of Winkleigh as reclusive anachronisms, seemingly unaware that the world had changed since the 19th century. Their farm was archaic, and wih the exception of Frances, who was occasionally glimpsed huddled over tombstones in dark churchyards, the Luxtons almost never left its grounds. With the discovery of their bodies, each shot at close range in the head, rumors began to circulate - of suicide pacts, family curses and incestuous relations between Robbie, the eldest Luxton, and his sister.

At the same time, the worst possible way to do a television biography, or even a reminiscence, is to have a lot of people commenting on, or recalling,the sub ject. Talking heads can deaden even the liveliest film, and a documentary can use them only with care. ''We Remember Eleanor,'' a one-hour documentary produced by WNEW- TV, uses them with great care, and the result is a modest triumph.
