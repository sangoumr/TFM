Some people want to be titillated, excited. A space should offer some of that. In the 80's, it was the disco restaurants, all that shiny material. Then they closed down. Q. How do you stay in touch with tastes but at the same time design a setting that will last? A. I try to create a timeless environment, to instill a sense that the restaurant's always been there. Q. What are the fads? A. Homeyness -- a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. I try to use natural materials, domestic woods like cherry, linoleum versus vinyl. I use a lot of stuff from Environmental Construction Outfitters in SoHo. At the T room, there's no rain-forest wood, no dangerous chemicals, no toxic materials. But it's not a religion for me. Q. What's all this comfort about? A. It's so important now. Modern life is uncomfortable, hurried, noisy. The domestic environment should be comfortable so you can relax, lean back, think. Q. But isn't a restaurant supposed to be a little different from home? A. Yes, people need to be entertained, so you need to make a restaurant a little more flamboyant, use brighter colors on walls, elaborate fabrics and light fixtures, make it more dressed-up. Q. What's artificial? A. Big, loud places in the Flatiron district. I'm doing one there now, and I'm scared. What can I say? I'll try to make it very relaxed. The buzzword in restaurant design is democratic, ""of the people."" I try to be careful with that word. It's something for everyman, universal. Q. How is the new Cub Room democratic? A. It's current to the 90's, and it's not meant to be a supper club. It has a casual cafe with a takeout section, and you can sit down. The barroom is where you can also eat, but it's for the young and beautiful. There's a nook where you can see pastry chefs working -- this is a little anti-reactionary. The dining room is separate, quieter, more comfortable, a tiny bit more formal with a more adult crowd. Off that room is a chef's dining room, the scale of a private dining room at home, with a table for 12. All the rooms are meant to peek into the kitchen without the noise. Q. What are other trends in restaurants? A. Retail, a lot of diversity in one place. The idea is not to exclude anyone, not the rich, the old, etc. I'm doing a place in Burlington, Vt., which has a housewares area, a restaurant, a cafe and a bakery. Bigger spaces are also a trend, and in that some people need their own little corner, a cocoon, while others like to be in the middle of the room. Q. What else is your style? A. I tailor styles to the client, taking the same approach as I do in my residential work. Most of the restaurant owners I work with are individuals, not companies or corporations. Kelley & Ping, for example, reflects my style in the painted wood floor, the easygoing tone. My work also has a sense of rough and soft, like masonry with upholstery. Examples of that are the T room, Savoy, Union Square Cafe. Q. Do you do research for your restaurants? A. I travel and go out to dinner all the time. I also take clients around to restaurants I like and dislike. Or we tour them, picking out lighting, floors. I take notes, pictures. Most restaurants don't mind if you do this. Q. What are some restaurants you're working on now? A. Heights Cafe in Brooklyn Heights. The Lemon in the Flatiron district. Lucky Dog Diner on the Lower East Side. A cafe in Battery Park. Warren Ashworth, my associate, is also working on these. Q. Do you ever think of opening your own restaurant? A. All the time. It would be a peaceful place, but that's all I want to say. I'd also like to open a children's restaurant.",1994-10-02T05:00:00+0000

That discovery about the random nature of events is at the heart of CITY OF GLASS (Avon, paper, $12), a novel by Paul Auster first published in 1985 and now issued as the first volume in Neon Lit, a series of mysteries adapted to the comic-book format. Mr. Auster's work would seem to be an unlikely choice: it is an elegant meditation on the fragility of identity and the wayward power of words. But in this terse adaptation of the book by Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli, the many layers of Mr. Auster's speculations about existence are peeled back to reveal a deft mystery, involving the obsessive efforts of a writer, passing himself off as a private detective, to protect a disturbed young man from his brilliant and quite possibly deranged father. Of course, nothing is as it seems: the young man may himself be deluded, his seductive young wife may have her own lethal agenda and the father may not be nearly as dangerous as he seems. Mr. Mazzucchelli's art is appropriately stark, demonstrating great ingenuity in rendering the intense isolation of these characters.

""Both are complex but intensely readable,"" one critic said last year. CURRICULUM VITAE: Autobiography By Muriel Spark. Houghton Mifflin, $10.95. Who was the model for Miss Jean Brodie? Who inspired the sad finality of ""Memento Mori""? This memoir of the author's first 39 years reveals what was autobiography and what was invention in many of her novels, as well as the facts behind her early failed marriage and her conversion to Roman Catholicism. Last year our reviewer, Helen Bevington, said, ""Reticent when she chooses but always free of invention, Muriel Spark succeeds in her mission: she puts the record straight."" ""Curriculum Vitae"" ends with the publication of Ms. Spark's first novel, THE COMFORTERS (New Directions, $10.95), which has just been reissued. In it a writer and Catholic convert begins hearing voices that make her realize she is a fictional character herself. The book ""adds to the growing evidence that Kingsley Amis and other members of the 'couldn't-care-less' school of writers are not the only lively force in British fiction today,"" Aileen Pippett said in The New York Times in 1957.

us,New York as Hell,"PRODUCER -- Severin/Aviles/Associates, New York City VISUAL -- This 30-second ad opens with a still photograph of a ""will work for food"" sign. Images flash of a body bag, a chalk outline of a corpse, ""for sale"" signs, a ""going out of business"" sign. Finally, the camera pans across a rubble-strewn city lot, followed by a grim-looking shot of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (the producers say the photographs were all taken in New York over the last week). SCRIPT -- ""This is Mario Cuomo's New York. Cuomo coddles criminals. Day and night, we are in danger -- on the street, at work, in school, even in our homes. Cuomo imposes crippling taxes. Business withers, jobs disappear, families suffer, dreams die. Cuomo plays politics. Working men and women pay the bills. Twelve years of Mario Cuomo. Can you afford four more? Dump Cuomo. Build New York."" ACCURACY -- It is true that people can often be in danger in New York, that some businesses wither and that some dreams die, but it is difficult if not impossible to make a case that it is true of New York alone or that Mr. Cuomo is solely responsible. But this dark portrait is not meant as history; it is an emotional summation of the three themes that may defeat Mr. Cuomo: crime, jobs and taxes. SCORECARD -- This ad was financed by the real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld, but it is as if it came from Dante, depicting New York as hell. There has been bad blood between the two men: in 1986, Mr. Cuomo knocked Mr. Hirschfeld off the ballot when he tried to run for lieutenant governor and last year, Mr. Cuomo successfully opposed Mr. Hirschfeld's attempts to buy the New York Post. Though he says it is not revenge, Mr. Hirschfeld says he is spending from $250,000 to $1 million to broadcast this ad, first in New York City and Albany, then perhaps across the state. Mr. Hirschfeld said he supports the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki (who is not mentioned in the ad), but that his primary reason for the ad was ""to help my fellow man"" by presenting his vision of New York State under Mr. Cuomo.",1994-10-06T05:00:00+0000

But the report did not alarm financial markets because the job growth was not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve to move immediately on interest rates. [ Page 39. ] While job growth was seen in all regions of the country, the unemployment rate in New Jersey rose to 6.7 percent, from 6 percent. In New York State, the rate fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.9 percent. [ 47. ] An overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws was approved by the Senate. The measure would set new rules making it easier for individuals to repay their debts on installment plans and harder for big corporate debtors to avoid their creditors. [ 39. ] Recycling is becoming a big business as economic recovery and greater mill capacity increase demand for raw material. Old corrugated boxes, waste paper, plastics and steel cans have been finding new and lucrative markets. [ 1. ] The F.C.C. may let cable operators charge what they want for new channels or services as long as they do not dilute programming protected under current price restrictions. [ 39. ] International U.S. executives remain wary about investing in South Africa, despite their applause for President Nelson Mandela earlier this week. Currency exchange controls, trade barriers and a militant labor force are seen as the chief obstacles. [ 39. ] Companies Shares of Broderbund Software jumped after the company reported higher-than-expected earnings and a stock split . [ 39. ] The stocks of Kemper and Conseco tumbled after Conseco said it was changing the financing for its acquisition of Kemper. [ 41. ] A Tenneco subsidiary signed agreements to develop two natural-gas-fired power plants in central Chile. [ 41. ] Thirteen bidders for F.C.C. licenses defaulted. The licenses for interactive video services will be re-auctioned. [ 41. ] Markets Stocks rallied. Buyers were encouraged by the employment report, which lessened expectations of an immediate increase in interest rates. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.77 points. [ 40. ] Treasury prices rose after the Government reported a rise in payrolls that was below market expectations. [ 47. ] The dollar strengthened, rising above 100 Japanese yen. The dollar was bolstered by gains in stocks and bonds and by a report showing a reduction in Japan's trade surplus. [ 48. ] Crude oil prices jumped before falling back. Traders bet a move by Iraqi forces toward Kuwait would not lead to an invasion. [ 48. ] Your Money Peter Lynch has kept his investment approach startingly simple. Mr. Lynch, who produced huge gains as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund before going into semiretirement four years ago, has made some changes in his own investment portfolio. Now, the renowned stock picker even buys bonds. [ 37. ] Olde Discount is offering trades without commissions. But there is a catch: the transactions must be in stocks recommended by analysts at the deep discount brokerage firm. [ 37. ] Citibank customers can buy and sell stocks on cash machines. Citibank, which began offering the service this week, is the first bank in the country to let customers make such trades.

CUOMO BATTLES FOR QUEENS VOTES Governor Cuomo had no trouble persuading his borough to send him to Albany once, twice, even three times. But as he requests a fourth term, he is finding that his homely expression about trust and doubt carries a double meaning, for there is no longer much enthusiasm for Mario Cuomo in Queens. He will probably win the borough again next month, both professional and amateur analysts predict. But he may do so by default, and with a far more slender margin than he has previously enjoyed. Page 1. Governor Cuomo has spent more than Senator Pataki, but Mr. Pataki is raising money quicker, according to campaign filings. Page 28. The contest between Governor Cuomo and Senator Pataki remains close, according to recently released polls. Page 28.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Portraits of the Artist","James Joyce once told Patrick Tuohy, one of the many artists who painted him: ""Never mind my soul. Just be sure you have my tie right."" The comment is emblematic of Joyce. JOYCE IMAGES (Norton, $39.95), a book of photographs and drawings edited by Greg Vitello, whose previous books include ""Twenty Years of Masterpiece Theater,"" reaffirms the face of the family man who was one incarnation of James Joyce (1882-1941) -- but the heart of the radical artist who saw life so intensely eludes this collection. Despite an excellent essay by Anthony Burgess on Joyce's life and work, completed shortly before Burgess's death in 1993, ""Joyce Images"" oddly reaffirms the limitations of the visual record. Five photographs of Joyce by Josef Breitenbach, published for the first time, take their place beside well-known portraits by Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Gisele Freund and Augustus John. One wishes for more text. The famous photograph of four generations of Joyces -- James; his son, Giorgio; and his grandson, Stephen, seated beneath Tuohy's portrait of Joyce's own father -- has a deeper significance if we know that Joyce considered a father ""a necessary evil."" Photographs of Joyce's daughter, Lucia, show an enigmatic, and lovely, young woman. She was ultimately lost to schizophrenia and confinement in mental hospitals, and Joyce believed it was she who had inherited his genius. Her brilliantly rendered drawing of her father is especially poignant because it demonstrates such fine control. The family record is brought more happily up to date with a photograph of the writer's only living descendant, Stephen Joyce. He is pictured with his wife, Solange Raytchine Joyce, who wears the ""Love is unhappy when love is away"" necklace that Joyce had made for Nora Barnacle in 1909. Recent drawings by Robert Motherwell and David Levine attest to the continuing fascination with Joyce. The admiration and reverence of other writers is documented by F. Scott Fitzgerald's whimsical cartoon of Joyce at a dinner party in 1928 and by one of the book's closing photographs, of Ezra Pound's visit to Joyce's grave site in Zurich shortly before Pound's own death in 1972. The homage paid by one great writer to another is a fitting image with which to end a book about a man who is ultimately accessible only through his own words.JOELLE ZOIS",1994-10-09T05:00:00+0000

The New Old Soft Shoe","WHAT: The Nike Air Moc, which a company catalogue calls a ""21st century moccasin."" Other people have referred to it as an Earth Shoe for the 90's, a high-tech Birkenstock or ""the potato shoe."" Less affectionately, it has been called a shoe for Smurfs.THE CONCEPT: Back to basics. Development began when Tory Orzek and Steve McDonald, outdoorsy Nike designers, asked themselves, ""What would happen if you just put a bag on your foot, and a minimal sole?""SOURCES OF INSPIRATION: Shoes with split toes used by Japanese workers for grasping tools, Navajo ankle-high moccasins, third world sandals made of old tire treads and the Nissan Figaro, a popular automobile sold only in Japan that evokes small cars of the 1950's.MATERIALS: The sole is made of recycled rubber called Nike Regrind. The inner sole is neoprene, and the heel stiffener is thermoplastic. The hand-stitched leather upper comes in light brown, with Nike's Swoosh logotype in accenting purple, or in black, with the logotype in silver.STRUCTURE: The soft, floppy upper, with an inner adjustable sleeve, is punctured with eight ventilating holes on each side and lies atop a compressed air sole of the sort used in running and basketball shoes. The upper is snugged tight at the ankle with a drawstring, somewhat like a laundry bag, secured with a spring-loaded toggle clasp borrowed from parka hoods. The sole's grid pattern functions as a heat sink, through which heat dissipates. The sole curves upward at its sides, and its waffle shape calls to mind the tire of a motocross bike, or the blackened fish special of the day, complete with grillmarks.PERSONALITY: The anti-athletic shoe, with none of the exoskeletal plastic straps or supports of high-tech basketball shoes. A shoe for the post-Air Jordan era, soft and floppy, shapeless and blobby, but also comfortable and versatile. Traditional Nike retailers like the Athlete's Foot have found the new shoe baffling; it appeals more to wearers of old Converse All Stars than to devotees of Shaq Attack, and at $65 is roughly half the price of top-of-the-line basketball shoes. It serves as a kind of Top-Sider for Lower East Siders, a woodland moccasin adapted for urban pavement.PRAISE: The shoe was cited for ""design distinction"" in the annual award issue of ID, the design magazine. One judge, Vincent Porcelli, called it ""sophisticated and ugly -- the perfect combination for life in the 1990's."" Another judge, Gerry Hirshberg, designer of the Infiniti J-30 and Nissan Altima, declared, ""In their blend of old and new, high and low, these shoes radiate a kind of truth.""NOMENCLATURE AND MARKETING: Originally called ""the potato shoe"" by its designers -- from the sack-on-your-foot concept and from the resemblance of the final product to a baked potato -- the shoe was featured in a Nike sales catalogue as Air Ida, on the model of Air Jordan, Air Max and other Nike shoes. But Nike says lawyers suggested that the H. J. Heinz Company, as owner of the Ore-Ida trademark, might not be pleased with the pun, so the name was changed to Air Moc.PHIL PATTON",1994-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Readers were left wondering what became of Nan St. George, a young American who made an unhappy marriage to a dull English duke and then dared to leave him. Marion Mainwaring's addition of new chapters has resulted in ""a fairy-tale novel, miraculously returned to life,"" Wendy Steiner said here last year. TRAVELS WITH LIZBETH By Lars Eighner. Fawcett Columbine, $11. For a number of authors, homelessness has been an experiment, an experience to be tried and then written about. For Lars Eighner, it was no literary choice. This chronicle, selected as one of the best books of 1993 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review, describes the three years in the 1980's that Mr. Eighner, jobless and destitute, spent on the road with his dog, a Labrador mix named Lizbeth. Our reviewer, Jonathan Raban, said, ""If there's any justice in the world it should guarantee its author a roof over his head for the rest of his days."" TROUBLE By Fay Weldon. Penguin, $10.95. There's plenty of it in the life of Annette Horrocks, a first-time novelist: She's pregnant and her husband, Spicer, has rejected her in favor of New Age psychotherapy and extramarital affairs. For her humorous adventures ""we must praise and thank Ms. Weldon and her wicked pen,"" Tama Janowitz said here last year. EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe By Eva Hoffman. Penguin, $11.95. The author investigates the cultures of six countries that used to be part of the Communist bloc, including her own homeland, Poland. She concludes that their identities are too often reductively described. Last year our reviewer, Robert D. Kaplan, said, ""Ms. Hoffman's book provokes fresh imaginings about a part of Europe where change is just beginning to unfold."" 21 SUGAR STREET By Lynn Lauber. Norton, $10. This first novel centers on two characters from the author's collection of short fiction, ""White Girls."" In 1970 Loretta Dardio, a white teen-ager in love with a black man, Luther Biggs, is forced to give up their baby daughter for adoption. Their story is ""wisely observed and well written,"" Mark Childress said here last year. THE GOLDEN THIRTEEN: Recollections of the First Black Naval Officers Edited by Paul Stillwell. Berkley, $15. During World War II, the Navy finally allowed black men to become officers. But such progress did little to halt racist behavior. Last year our reviewer, William H. Honan, called these reminiscences -- from the eight survivors of the original 13 black officers and from three white commanders -- ""fascinating and moving."" Racial prejudice in the military is also explored in ASSAULT AT WEST POINT: The Court-Martial of Johnson Whittaker, by John F. Marszalek (Collier/Macmillan, $12), an account of the experiences of the third black man to enter the academy. Originally titled ""Court Martial,"" the book tells how Whittaker, a former slave, was court-martialed in 1881 for supposedly faking a brutal assault against him. ""It reads like a well-paced courtroom fiction,"" The Book Review said in 1973. THREE NOVELS: The Deep, Beasts, Engine Summer By John Crowley. Bantam, $12.95. This volume gathers together early science fiction works by a master of the genre. In ""The Deep,"" John Crowley's first novel, warring societies on an Earthlike planet are visited by an emissary on a strange mission. In 1977 our reviewer, Gerald Jonas, said, ""Paraphrase is useless to convey the intensity"" of the prose. ""Beasts"" takes place in an anarchic future in which the United States no longer exists and a new species -- part lion, part man -- plays an important role. The author ""displays a prodigious inventiveness,"" Mr. Jonas said here in 1976. There is still another post-apocalyptic vision in ""Engine Summer."" In 1979 our reviewer, again Mr. Jonas, praised its ""ingenious, well-made plot."" THE CIVIL WAR By Geoffrey C. Ward, with Ric Burns and Ken Burns. Vintage, $13. This edition of the companion volume to the acclaimed 1990 PBS series doesn't have the photographs that appeared in the hardcover, but it faithfully reproduces the text, which includes narratives by politicians, soldiers and slaves. It is ""thoroughly researched"" and ""vividly written,"" David Haward Bain said here. A particularly poignant passage in Civil War history is chronicled in THE LAST FULL MEASURE: The Life and Death of the First Minnesota Volunteers, by Richard Moe (Avon, $15), the story of the 262-man regiment assigned the suicidal task of stopping the huge force of Confederate soldiers who were about to divide the Union Army at Gettysburg. Last year our reviewer, Richard E. Nich olls, called it ""a vigorous, haunting celebration."" Also reissued is WITHOUT CONSENT OR CONTRACT: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery, by Robert William Fogel (Norton, $14.95), which expands upon the theses of the author's 1974 book, ""Time on the Cross."" This history acknowledges slavery's horrors while analyzing the sometimes questionable moral practices of its abolitionist opponents. ""Mr. Fogel has the good judgment to moderate the polemical tone"" of his earlier work, C. Vann Woodward said here in 1989. TONY AND SUSAN By Austin Wright. Warner, $5.99. Susan Morrow's ex-husband has returned to her life: he wants her to comment on his first novel. Last year our reviewer, Brendan Bernhard, called this fiction ""a brain-teasing page turner.""

The Americans will face England, which won all nine of its matches in the first three rounds, in one semifinal today. The other semifinal in the $1.5 million event will pit South Africa against Canada. Tom Kite shot a three-under 69 and took advantage of bogeys by Grant Waite on the last two holes to win by two shots. Curtis Strange (69) beat Frank Nobilo by one, and Fred Couples (72) survived a bogey at No. 17 to defeat Greg Turner by two. The results left the Americans and Irish, who beat Japan by 2-1, tied atop the Group One standing with two victories each, but the United States advanced because it had six victories in individual games to Ireland's five. (AP) U.S. Is Back in Lead: Tiger Woods's five-under-par 67 boosted the United States back into the lead of the world amateur team championships in La Boulie, France. With three of four individual scores counting, the Americans finished the third round with a 16-under 629 total, one better than a team of golfers from Britain and Ireland and four better than Australia. Woods, 18, said a tip from a golf writer -- that his hip turn was too big -- helped him shoot eight birdies and three bogeys on his third trip over the 6,734-yard French National layout. Allen Doyle, a veteran of amateur play, shot a 69. Todd Demsey shot 71 and John Harris a 72 for Americans. The best round of the tournament came from 21-year-old Jason Dawes of Australia, who shot a course-record nine-under 63.

China has 62 gold medals, followed by 24 for South Korea, which won in archery, shooting and its native taekwondo. Japan has 22 after winning in bowling and men's swimming. In the pool, the world-record holder Le Jingyi was disqualified for a false start in the 50-meter freestyle and Lu Bin raced to victory in 25.68 seconds for her fourth gold.

Andretti, driving in his 407th and last Indy-car race at age 54, had a frustrating day, damaging his car in a first-lap accident and winding up 18th after his engine blew just three laps from the end. He wound up watching from the pits as Tracy took the checkered flag. ""I'm just going to have to find out if there is life after driving after all,"" Andretti said. ""And I'm sure there is."" The day quickly turned from one of nostalgia for Andretti to the brutal realities of racing. On Lap 1, in the third turn, Michael Andretti, Mario's eldest son, was sidelined and the father's car was damaged in a multicar melee. (AP) After 56 Races, a Victory: Dale Jarrett broke a 55-race streak in which he failed to make the winner's circle yesterday by shooting past Morgan Shepherd with less than four laps left and holding on to win the Mello Yello 500 in a wild finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. His third career victory, and first since the 1993 Daytona 500, came one week after Jarrett had failed to qualify for the race at North Wilkesboro, N.C. ""I was at the bottom of the ocean last Sunday,"" Jarrett said. ""We have too good a team to not at least make a race. But I think that gave everybody a good wake-up call."" Shepherd wound up second and Dale Earnhardt, who finished third, took a big step forward in his bid for a seventh Winston Cup season driving title. (AP) GOLF Canada Upsets U.S. to Win Dunhill Cup Canada took advantage of blunders by Tom Kite and Fred Couples to upset the United States, the defending champion, yesterday and win the Dunhill Cup in St. Andrews, Scotland. Dave Barr (70) defeated Kite, who lost his match by one after making a double bogey on No. 17. Couples missed a 3-foot putt on No. 16 and also ended up one stroke behind Ray Stewart (71). The two Canadian victories made Curtis Strange's seven-shot victory over Rick Gibson meaningless. Strange closed with a sizzling 67. Canada had never before advanced as far as the semifinals. (AP) U.S. Captures Amateur Title: An American team led by 46-year-old Allen Doyle and 18-year-old Tiger Woods ended five years of frustration for the United States yesterday, running away with the World Amateur golf title in La Boulie, France. After finishing second each of the past five years, the United States team turned its one-shot lead at the start of the final round into an 11-shot cushion at the end. The United States has now won the title 10 of the 19 times it has been contested.

The camera pans around the room to various Cuomo children and grandchildren listening as the patriarch talks about crime. SCRIPT Mr. Cuomo: ""We'll never forget when Matilda was mugged. And I still worry when my daughters are out alone at night. Crime touches too many of us. That's why we've doubled state prisons in taking criminals off the streets in record numbers. Now, I want to ban assault weapons and put career criminals away for life. But we also must give young people hope of a good future before they are seduced by drugs and money. We're making progress, but not enough. My job is to keep fighting to make life safer for all our families."" SCORECARD Amid a storm of attack ads against State Senator George E. Pataki, his Republican opponent, this is Mr. Cuomo's first spot in recent weeks that focuses on his own record and plans. It operates on several levels. He lets viewers see his family -- a textbook trick for politicians seeking to seem softer or more human -- and says he has a personal reason to share their worries. He defends his record, which he has not always found easy because of his opposition to the death penalty. Finally, he says that fighting crime ultimately hinges on prevention, a message that sells big with his base of liberal and black Democratic voters.",1994-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary: October 9-14,"COMAPNIES Today's Artists Unite, and Hollywood May Never Be the Same In 1919, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith had a Hollywood-shaking idea -- get together some people who know movies and let them run the show. United Artists was born. Since those glory days, though, corporations and committees and accountants have taken over -- and their movies, alas, often look the part. But last week a grand cycle came round again as three men who indisputably know movies now -- Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- joined forces to create a studio. The rest of Hollywood may soon look as if a ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaur had tromped through. Mr. Spielberg will stop making films for Universal, Mr. Katzenberg will probably raid the animation talent at Disney, his former home, Mr. Geffen will bring his production unit. And all that talent will flow to the new studio. A Novel Cash-Flow Problem Every company should have such problems. Chrysler -- yes, the one that almost went under -- has been making so much money it's running out of mattresses to stuff it in. With buyers clamoring for its cars and Cherokees, its earnings reports are getting boring -- another quarter, another record. And again last week: $11.66 billion in revenues, $651 million in profits, both records. So, what to do with it? The company even has all it needs in its pension funds -- the first time since 1957. It could raise the dividend, it could buy back some stock. But it also hasn't forgotten how wet the rainy days can be. The Car-Buying Minuet What is it about new cars? When you buy anything else, you shop around, you find the best price, you pay it. Simple. (Or you don't shop around, you pay too much, you kick yourself.) With cars, though, a bizarre world has evolved -- meaningless price tags, complex formulas for figuring what the price should be and the dealer's profit. (But do you know the deli's profit on that bagel and coffee?) And then ""no haggle"" pricing, to make it all nice and simple. But nothing, of course, is simple -- last week it turned out that the Justice Department is investigating the whole idea of no-haggle pricing. What are they looking for? Price-fixing possibly. Or maybe, like the rest of us, they're just trying to figure out what's going on. Lutece Super-Value Meals? The bistros come and go, the temples of Tuesday's cuisine vanish by Wednesday. And then there's Lutece, as indestructible as the Brooklyn Bridge. But the bridge shook a bit last week: Andre Soltner sold Lutece. So is it any cause for alarm that the buyer, Ark Restaurants, owns less-illustrious establishments like Albuquerque Eats and B. Smith's? No, insists Ark's president; this pillar of French cuisine will remain intact. But -- a ""but"" always seems to sneak in about now -- ""there may be room for enhancement,"" he said, like a ""Lutece Brasserie somewhere."" Stay off the Brooklyn Bridge. Toys Don't Kill? Think Again Kids love toy guns; parents hate them. So guess who usually wins out: Toy guns were a $246 million business in this country last year. But parents' vague unease has turned to tangible fear lately, as one New York boy, then another, was shot by a police officer who mistook a toy gun for the real thing. Toys 'R' Us heard those shots loud and clear, and last week it said it would stop selling ""realistic"" toy guns; others, like Kay-Bee Toys, quickly followed suit. Toys 'R' Us had banished toy guns before, but later started selling guns in bright colors -- to mark them as fake. But kids started painting them to look real, so the issue exploded again. Microsoft, On Top Again Microsoft clearly intends to be master of everything it touches, and if it can't build what it needs, it won't hesitate to buy it. Its own personal-finance software has managed only 4 percent of the market. But Bill Gates probably can't even see numbers that small, so last week, he had Microsoft issue $1.5 billion in stock -- in the largest software acquisition ever -- to buy Intuit, whose Quicken software owns the market. So if more people take to writing checks and paying bills electronically, Microsoft could just tiptoe in with a tiny transaction fee, then gather those golden crumbs into quite a rich cake indeed. ECONOMY Making Economics a Game There's a concept in economics called ""perfect competition"" -- the idea that businesses and nations exist in a vast state of nature, and the fittest will prevail by brute, faceless mathematical force. Some economists, though, think it's a bit murkier -- that something called ""game theory"" must be factored in. That theory takes into account the bluff and swagger, the backing and filling, of real-life competition -- a world, in short, in which rivals play a lot of ""games,"" possibly devious ones. Last week this economic school got a powerful blessing when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three game-theory pioneers. Lilco as Politics? Don't Be Silly There's been talk of a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company for years, especially during the Shoreham mess. But it's naturally just a coincidence that Governor Cuomo proposed a takeover just last week -- a few weeks before his charmed political life could skid to a halt. Certainly it's not politics -- though the takeover would, by the by, lower rates for Lilco customers, among the nation's highest, by about 10 percent. George Pataki -- possibly munching some sour grapes as he witnessed, in living color, the joys of incumbency -- called it ""the height of political opportunism."" But Mr. Cuomo insisted it was ""for the public."" Follow the Bouncing Subsidy One way to get cheap magazine subscriptions is to accept a cut-rate offer, not renew, then take another introductory offer. Companies could probably play that game, too, hopping from New York to Connecticut and back, following the tax break du jour. Last week, angry that Swiss Bank had been lured to Stamford, Mayor Giuliani started talking tough, saying that a 1991 tristate peace treaty had been broken and he'd start trying to entice companies away from Connecticut. New York, in fact, has just offered Viacom $15 million in tax breaks to stick around. Of course, as a Connecticut official pointed out, the whole region gets hurt by this tax-draining game. No Inflation for Retirees Don't mention inflation to people getting Social Security; there's none of it in their paychecks. When the consumer price numbers came in on Friday, the yearly increase added up to just 2.8 percent -- and that instantly became the magic number for 1995 Social Security increases. But for all that talk about lurking inflation, that's the third-smallest increase since the payments were pegged to price rises two decades ago. And the consumer-price data came on top of a surprising decline in producer prices reported the day before -- so, yet again, that feared price pressure isn't showing up on any radar. INTERNATIONAL A Weak Link: The Ruble Russia's on a tightrope. It has to get its economy moving, but if it tries to do so by overdoing subsidies to business, the resulting inflation will be as destructive as anything else. Last week it took quite a jolt on that tightrope, as currency markets suddenly had big doubts and sent the ruble plummeting by 25 percent against the dollar -- its biggest single drop ever. Russia had made big strides in taming inflation, but this could well send it back to the drawing board. Boris Yeltsin started talking about conspiracies, and heads rolled -- Mr. Yeltsin fired the acting Finance Minister. But it was really just the market, and speculators, at work. The central bank managed to get the ruble to bounce back the next day, but that by no means meant the crisis was over. That was clear on Friday when the head of the central bank resigned. What Now for Mexican Labor? So now that Nafta has been around a while, what's in store for workers at American-owned plants in Mexico? An answer may be taking shape. With Mexican factory workers lucky to get $16 a day -- about what Americans get an hour -- American unions have been trying to address that disparity. But there have been charges that companies like Honeywell and General Electric have fired union sympathizers, so the unions turned to Labor Secretary Robert Reich to ride to the rescue. But last week Mr. Reich refused to pursue the complaints. And union organizers and companies alike were watching it all very closely.",1994-10-16T05:00:00+0000

The sale was completed Thursday.The equity securities were sold at a premium to the net book value of the Canadian company, but the translation into U.S. dollars and other costs of the transaction resulted in a charge to the company of $ 6.8 million after tax, or 18 cents a fully diluted common share in the third quarter 1994.In addition, recognition by the company of a noncash charge for U.S. taxes on previously undistributed Canadian earnings amounted to $ 20.2 million, or 53 cents a fully diluted common share.Boise Cascade holds approximately 60 percentof Rainy River's economic equity, but only 49 percent of its voting equity. Since the company will no longer exercise voting control, Rainy River has been accounted for on the equity method retroactive to Jan. 1, 1994, in the company's consolidated financial statements.In the company's Statements of Income (Loss) for the three months and nine months ended Sept. 30, 1994, Rainy River's results of operations are included in ''Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates.'' Equity in net income and losses of other affiliates has also been reclassified for all periods presented.Results for the third quarter of 1993 included a net pretax gain of $ 5.3 million, or 9 cents a fully diluted common share after tax, which was primarily attributable to an asset sale.The computation of fully diluted net loss per common share was antidilutive; therefore, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted loss are the same.(Loss)",1994-10-17T05:00:00+0000

Thompson has assembled a collection of mash notes -- faxes to George Stephanopoulos, James Carville and others in the Clinton inner circle, missives that suggest Mr. Thompson's involvement in the Clinton Presidential campaign went beyond that of a mere observer. Mr. Thompson offers pointers on strategy and policy, even instructs the candidate on speaking properly. Mr. Thompson is back in the form we've come to know and love (or at least tolerate), firing at the usual targets, from George Bush and James Baker 3d, the former Secretary of State, to Mr. Thompson's nemesis, Richard M. Nixon, who died just before the book was finished (but not before Mr. Thompson worked up a remembrance that may be charitably described as uncharitable). Such shooting from the hip is Mr. Thompson's forte; what disappoints in this book is its disjointedness. ""Better Than Sex"" reads like a hodgepodge, a series of dispatches hurriedly lashed together. But in his own cracked, inimitable style, Mr. Thompson proves to be an upbeat Jeremiah, a civic-minded curmudgeon. ""It is a very elegant feeling,"" he writes, ""to wake up in the morning and go down to your neighborhood polling place and come away feeling proud of the way you voted.""

Nearly 200 years after he lived there, the pristine nature sanctuary and its grand old stone mansion evoke the spirit of the Haitian-born French emigre whose lively, accurate watercolors -- owned by the New-York Historical Society and now on national tour (they will be at the Historical Society May 3 to Aug. 6, 1995) -- revolutionized the art of bird illustration. ""Its fine woodlands, its extensive acres, its fields crowned with evergreens, offered many subjects to my pencil,"" Audubon wrote of Mill Grove in his journal.

POPULAR MASTER","The scholar Cornel West asks a prickly question in his essay in I TELL MY HEART: The Art of Horace Pippin (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts/Universe, $40): ""Can the reception of the work of a black artist transcend mere documentary, social pleading or exotic appeal?"" Judith E. Stein's carefully researched exhibition catalogue takes a judicious approach to providing an answer for the work of Horace Pippin (1888-1946). A self-taught painter and resident of West Chester, Pa., Pippin came to prominence in the late 1930's and 40's through the efforts of a number of white critics, curators and patrons, including the Philadelphia collector Albert C. Barnes. In his catalogue essay for Pippin's first solo show in 1940, Barnes called Pippin ""the first important Negro painter to appear on the American scene."" Included in the ""Masters of Popular Painting"" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1938, Pippin became a key figure at the intersection of two important trends in the history of modern art in the United States: scene painting and primitivism. Pippin's bold, simplified domestic scenes, landscapes, portraits and history paintings synthesized the two, making his work highly marketable to an audience eager to prove its own sophistication through its very modern appreciation of so-called primitive art. A particular strength of ""I Tell My Heart"" is its attention to the relations between Pippin and the nexus of dealers, patrons, critics and curators who promoted and collected his work. For as Judith Wilson, who teaches art history at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, points out in another essay, Pippin's example ""refutes a stereotype -- that of the self-taught artist as a socio-cultural isolate."" Ms. Stein, an adjunct curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, has assembled a catalogue that offers great insight not only into Pippin's work, but also into the American art world of the 1930's and 40's.MIGNON NIXON",1994-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Answering the N.R.A.,"CANDIDATE Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat being challenged for re-election in Nebraska by Jan Stoney, a Republican, is one of several lawmakers being opposed by the National Rifle Association because of his vote for a ban on assault weapons. This is Mr. Kerrey's response to an association's advertisement featuring the actor Charlton Heston, who asserted: ""You said you wouldn't vote for gun bans. But you went to Washington and voted for the first Federal gun ban in American history."" PRODUCER Struble/Totten Communications ON THE SCREEN Opens with men on a shooting range, with red letters declaring, ""A Message to Charlton Heston from Bob Kerrey."" The camera zooms in on Mr. Kerrey, dressed in hunting garb, as he fires at a clay pigeon. As he talks into the camera, he ejects the shell from the shotgun he just used, and then, midway through, puts the gun down and picks up another weapon. SCRIPT An announcer says, ""A message for Charlton Heston from Senator Bob Kerrey."" Then Mr. Kerrey says: ""I'm a hunter, and I believe in the constitutional right to bear arms. When it's time to hunt birds, you need a good gun like this Ruger Red Label. Twenty-five years ago, in the war in Vietnam, people hunted me. They needed a good weapon -- like this AK-47. But you don't need one of these to hunt birds."" The announcer then says: ""Bob Kerrey. The courage to lead."" ACCURACY The distinction Mr. Kerrey draws is correct. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that the semi-automatic version of the AK-47 would be covered by the ban in the crime bill, which covers 19 types of semi-automatic weapons. The spokesman also said that shotguns like the Ruger Red Label would be unaffected by the ban. SCORECARD The ad is a tough response to a tough attack: Mr. Kerrey deals head-on with the charge that his support for a ban on semi-automatic weapons was a sellout of Nebraska hunters and gun owners. By word and message, he is trying to tell hunters that he is one of them. And, as is often the case with Mr. Kerrey, his background as a veteran of the Vietnam War, where he lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor, gives a political argument an emotional punch.

But inflation showed no sign of acceleration in the Commerce Department's report on gross domestic product for the third quarter. The Clinton Administration trumpeted the data as portraying a healthy, stable economy. [ Page 1. ] Wall Street's woes threaten a fragile recovery in New York City and its suburbs. The financial industry, which had led the local economy out of recession, is suffering a downturn nearly as sharp as the stock market crash of 1987. But this time the losses have been in the less-visible bond market, which once provided a cushion of stability for the volatile securities business. [ 1. ] Markets Bonds staged a surprisingly strong rally, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond below the psychologically important level of 8 percent. Investors were heartened by the report on third-quarter economic growth, which showed inflation in check. [ 37. ] Stocks surged, bolstered by the G.D.P. report. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 55.51 points, or 1.4 percent. [ 38. ] The dollar strengthened as currency dealers took their cues from the advances in bonds and stocks in the United States. [ 47. ] Gasoline prices rose sharply after two refineries halted operations, heightening concerns about tight supplies. [ 47. ] Companies Metropolitan Life is seeking to put a sales scandal behind it by shaking up its ranks and moving to improve training of its sales force. A cautious and conservative approach helped the company avoid the kinds of investment mistakes that have plagued some other insurers. But that tendency to avoid rocking the boat also allowed some bad sales and management habits to fester. [ 37. ] Johnson & Johnson hopes sucralose will rival aspartame. But the no-calorie sweetener must first win F.D.A. approval.

Yet when the reports came, they showed that while the economy had grown surprisingly fast over the summer quarter -- a 3.4 percent pace -- inflation was still not a danger. This so cheered the markets that the Dow industrials soared 55 points, and Treasury yields dipped back below that magic number, to 7.95. And Democrats, fearing a trouncing at the polls, were quick to remind voters that all this good stuff was happening on their watch.",1994-10-30T05:00:00+0000

Ready to See the Truth?","WHAT: The True Mirror, a looking glass that does not reverse images the way conventional mirrors do. Printed matter, for instance, reads correctly when reflected in this mirror.A 107-YEAR-OLD IDEA: The concept, which involves joining two mirrors at a 90-degree angle, was first patented 107 years ago by a Catholic priest in England. It was recently resurrected by John Walter, a 35-year-old Manhattan computer consultant. Mr. Walter was in the bathroom of a friend's home when epiphany struck. ""There was a mirror on the medicine cabinet at a right angle from the mirror on the wall. I looked over and saw a totally different energy. It was a very happy thing I was seeing.""SEAMLESS REFLECTION: It took Mr. Walter 12 years to come up with a design that does not produce a visible seam where the two mirrors meet. While the usual mirror consists of a plate of glass with a coat of reflective aluminum on the back, Mr. Walter buys front-surface mirrors, which have the aluminum applied to the front of the glass. Nearly half of the mirrors he builds are rejects. ""It's a very precise optical instrument,"" he said.FOR ART'S SAKE: True Mirror enthusiasts insist that the mirror is more than a precision tool for the vain. Susan Shaftan, an artist in New Jersey, says the mirror has enabled her to paint and sculpture more accurate self-portraits. ""In a regular mirror, the planes are flat,"" she said. ""The images you see in a True Mirror are way more sculptural.""ABSENCE OF BALANCE: Many True Mirror fans, like Mr. Walter, take a mystical view, saying the True Mirror offers a window into their true personalities. But first-timers are generally more likely to see their outer flaws. ""Some people like it; other people are taken aback by seeing their image flipped,"" said Dennis Duca, who has a True Mirror on display in his SoHo Natural Light Studio, a rental studio for photographers. ""A lot of people say, 'I look crooked.' ""BAGGY-EYE SYNDROME: A recent True Mirror demonstration in Washington Square in Manhattan elicited a range of reactions. ""I'm lopsided,"" noted Helen Rothauser, 45, of Manhattan. Elizabeth Sagarin, 19, a New York University student, found her unreversed reflection upsetting. ""I look like I have a baggy eye,"" she said.SHAVING ACCIDENTS: While the True Mirror may be a crowd pleaser at parties, using the mirror for personal grooming could have disastrous consequences. ""If you want to buy it to do something in, like shave, you'd have a horrible time,"" said Tony Movshon, a professor of neural science at N.Y.U.THE PRICE OF TRUTH: Mr. Movshon predicted that scientists would find little use for such a mirror. ""Though I dare say it will make money for someone,"" he said. Indeed, truth does have a price. The mirrors cost $195 for a 12-inch model and $245 for an 18-inch model. The top of the line, which offers a full-body view, is four feet tall and costs $750. The mirrors are sold through the True Mirror Company, P.O.

us,"What Makes Brooklyn Angry: The 'Quality of Life,' West of Flatbush","IN August, The City began an examination of how residents defined the ""Quality of Life,"" a political mantra that has no single meaning. The first installment focused on Manhattan; the second on Queens. Because it is so large, Brooklyn has been split in two, with Flatbush Avenue as a natural divider. Taken as a whole, the area west of Flatbush has distinct characteristics, with less of the sweeping poverty of several neighborhoods to the east -- Bushwick, East New York and Brownsville. The emphasis of concerns differs by neighborhood -- traffic and parking in the northwest; loitering by youths in the southwest; flooding in Coney Island and Brighton Beach. Illegal dumping is raising anger; drugs keep people in fear, particularly around housing projects. Not all issues are mentioned in the map. It is simply a sampling of views of residents, merchants, police and community board officials. East of Flatbush will be examined next. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, DOWNTOWN, BOERUM HILL 1. PARKING Lack of parking coupled with aggressive enforcement. 2. LOITERING Residents complain about residents of the St. George Hotel at Clark and Henry; some panhandling. 3. PANHANDLERS A frequent problem for the shoppers at the Fulton Mall 4-6. DRUGS Street activity at (4) Willoughby and Flatbush; (5) Bond and Livingston, and (6) Bond and Wyckoff. 7. FLOODING Serious conditions at Third Avenue and Atlantic Avenue during rains. 8. TRAFFIC Congestion and a lack of parking spaces throughout Boerum Hill. Double-parking prevalent. COBBLE HILL/CARROLL GARDENS 9. TRAFFIC Congestion in Cobble Hill. 10. MAIL Slow mail delivery. 11. SUBWAY F Train sometimes bypasses Carroll Street stop without adequate notice during construction and track work. RED HOOK 12. SUBWAY Frequent escalator breakdowns at Smith-Ninth Street station. 13. PARKS At Coffey Park, deteriorating restrooms, inadequate equipment, illegal parking. 14-15. TRAFFIC (14)Van Brunt Street: Noise and fumes from heavy truck traffic. (15) Columbia Street: Still designated as a truck route despite heavy residential population in the Red Hook Houses. 16. DRUGS Drug sales and related violence in and around the Red Hook Houses. 17. ILLEGAL DUMPING Misuse and abuse of vacant lots and other tracts throughout area. PARK SLOPE 18. PARKING New aggressive ticketing of cars that double park on alternate-side days. Residents say this violates a traditional accommodation made necessary by brownstones' lack of driveways and carports, as well as a dearth of commercial parking facilities in the area. 19. GRAFFITI Seventh Avenue and Fifth Avenue from Flatbush Avenue west. 20. SANITATION Debris on commercial streets, especially Seventh Avenue. But merchants claim they are being ticketed for debris that they have nothing to do with, even after they've cleaned up. 21. TREES Poor maintenance on residential blocks. 22. CRIME Thefts of flowers, trees, plants and planters from private property. SUNSET PARK 23. TRAFFIC Double-parked trucks cause congestion between 24th and 26th Street and other locations along Fourth Avenue. 24. ILLEGAL DUMPING A problem at Third Avenue at the Prospect Expressway. 25. PROSTITUTION Street trade along Third Avenue between 55th and 65th Streets. 26. DRUGS Still some street activity at various points on Third and Fourth Avenues in the 40's and 50's, though enforcement has forced a number of operations to move indoors. BOROUGH PARK 27.

The book is less a thoroughgoing analysis of musical technique than an anecdotal medley of the observations of a master. Vocalists who influenced him include the usual pantheon of gods (Bessie, Billie, Frank, Bing, Nat, Ella, Louis) and grandes dames (Ethel Waters, Mabel Mercer, Connee Boswell, Helen Forrest), as well as a few artists not known primarily for their singing: Johnny Mercer, Woody Herman, Fred Astaire. A gifted arranger and composer as well as a pre-eminent performer of American popular music, Mr. Torme displays the extent of his musicianship as he discusses the songwriters, instrumentalists, arrangers, bandleaders, vocal groups, Broadway and film vocalists and scat singers who are among his ""role models almost too numerous to mention."" I was fascinated to read that he numbers among his ""heroes and heroines"" the offstage Hollywood singers who were the ""voices of the stars"" in the film musicals of the 1940's, 50's and 60's: Anita Ellis, Carole Richards, Martha Mears, Marni Nixon, Buddy Clark and others. (We learn that Robert McFerrin, father of the pop star Bobby McFerrin, was the singing voice of Sidney Poitier in the 1959 film ""Porgy and Bess."") Mr. Torme, whose previous books include portraits of Buddy Rich (""Traps, the Drum Wonder"") and Judy Garland (""The Other Side of the Rainbow""), remains a musician first and a writer second; no one reading ""My Singing Teachers"" will advise him to give up his night job. But those who have admired the modesty, generosity and taste he has displayed as a singer will find many of those same qualities in this book. PATRICIA T. O'CONNER",1994-10-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Tales of Tampa,"Sometimes the most valuable memories are best labeled ""stretchers,"" to use Huckleberry Finn's term for recollections caught somewhere between fact and fiction. YBOR CITY CHRONICLES: A Memoir (University Press of Florida, $24.95), Ferdie Pacheco's nostalgic account of his childhood in the late 1930's and early 1940's in the Latin quarter of Tampa, Fla., can confidently be called a stretcher. One senses that after 50 years, Dr. Pacheco has allowed the espresso to grow a bit stronger, the Cuban bread crustier and the neighborhood characters more intriguing. After all, as Dr. Pacheco, a television boxing commentator and Muhammad Ali's former physician, describes it, Ybor City's blend of cultures and classes proved fertile ground for mythmaking. There was, for example, the legendary figure of Sweet Sam, an elegant delivery man who owned a grand piano but mysteriously refused to play it. Dr. Pacheco's father also looms large, demanding Old World respect from his family. The author describes the restaurants, social clubs and movie theaters that serve as the backdrop for his memories. His stories are bolstered by photographs and his own cartoons, so the reader can actually see the place as he saw it. Dr. Pacheco is enthralled by the memory of a neighborhood of family and friends inextricably tied together by custom, values and concerns. It is these traits that make his anecdotes worth relating.

Situated 52 miles east of San Juan and 12 miles west of St. Thomas, Culebra is a lovely, rather rustic part of the Puerto Rican commonwealth consisting of 7,000 acres (including surrounding cays) and 1,600 inhabitants. Like Vieques, a sister island nine miles to the south, Culebra attracts sun worshippers from the continental United States in winter and vacationers from the ""big island"" of Puerto Rico in summer. Its powdery beaches also lure several varieties of sea turtle, including the giant leatherback, the largest of all marine reptiles. Between February and July, leatherback females, averaging 6 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds, clamber onto Culebra's shores at night to deposit their eggs before returning to the water to undertake a long and (to humans) mysterious migration from the Caribbean Sea to colder waters.",1994-10-30T05:00:00+0000
