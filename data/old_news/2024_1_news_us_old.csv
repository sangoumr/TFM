The question, posed by a mother to a general who is scheming to overthrow the British, encapsulates the contradiction woven throughout Chan’s novel. Housewives become spies; saviors become oppressors; unlikely friendships bloom; and young men endure and inflict horrific violence.

Published late last year, “The Korean Cookbook” by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.) And with its focus on regional cooking, the book needs a map for those unfamiliar with Korean geography.",2024-01-02T10:01:12+0000

Nine years before this drawing was created, Duranty wrote something critical of Manet, in response to which Manet, encountering Duranty in a cafe, slapped him. Duranty demanded that Manet apologize. Manet refused. Duranty challenged Manet to a duel. The duel, by sword, took place three days later. Manet was unscathed; I guess you could say he won. Duranty, the man in the Degas drawing, “received a wound in his upper chest,” as the museum text accompanying the drawing states matter-of-factly.

us,"Coqodaq, From the Cote Team, Is a Temple of Fried Chicken","Beef or chicken? The restaurateur Simon Kim now has you covered either way. An owner of the Korean steakhouse Cote is opening what he calls a “fried chicken cathedral,” with a dining room framed by glowing, barrel-vaulted arches that disappear to infinity, thanks to a rear wall mirror. The design is by the Rockwell Group, involving David Rockwell’s personal touch. But the food is Mr. Kim’s idea, more than four years in the making, with the executive chef Seung Kyu Kim in charge (no relation to the owner, though the two met while working at Jean-Georges). Simon Kim’s notion is to offer a mix of American and Korean approaches to fried chicken and give it glamour with (supposedly) more sustainable ingredients in a more elegant setting. At Coqodaq it’s one-size-fits-all, a $38 dinner that includes chicken soup; a bucket of chicken parts fried in a gluten-free batter based on rice flour, chicken glazed with gochujang or soy and garlic; a cold perilla noodle dish; banchan, small dishes, that include palate-cleansing white radish; and soft serve frozen yogurt. Starters (extra) include some seafood options. The chickens are pasture-raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, and triple-fried in oil produced in Iowa from fermented Brazilian sugar cane. The name of the restaurant blends French, American and Korean words for chicken. The sommelier, Victoria James, who also curates the wines at Cote, has a wine list that features Champagne, which she and Mr. Kim agree is the ideal beverage for fried chicken. Her list offers 400 of them, and other sparklers by the glass and the bottle. Considering that fried chicken is finger-food, in the front of the restaurant, there’s a hand-washing area with three sinks. Some high-top tables near the entrance are for walk-ins, there’s a long bar, and garage doors will open to an outside patio in warmer weather. Tables at the leather-upholstered booths beneath the arches in the 190-seat room have lazy susans, the better for sharing. (Opens Friday)",2024-01-09T16:57:45+0000

After retiring from football in 2020, he founded the design practice Studio Kër. Bennett’s exploration of the Black home led him to create an 11-piece collection of sculptural furniture that he’s debuting this month in “We Gotta Get Back to the Crib,” his inaugural exhibition for the Los Angeles art gallery Marta, presented at Theaster Gates’s Rebuild Foundation in Chicago. (In the spring, the show will travel to Houston.) The collection reimagines objects of communal gatherings; pieces include the Gumbo lounge chair, a lush take on the stackable monobloc chair, and the Pew couch, a nod to the church bench, made of leather and ekki wood. “For me, the show is about celebrating Black ingenuity and connecting back to that African diasporic design language,” says Bennett. “We Gotta Get Back to the Crib” is on view from Jan. 12 through Feb. 10, marta.la.",2024-01-11T15:19:37+0000

In “Leo,” Burr’s Squirtle is the grouchy sidekick to Leo, a septuagenarian lizard (voiced by Adam Sandler). They share a terrarium in a fifth grade classroom in Florida, and when Leo realizes he’s reaching the end of his reptilian life span, he has a sudden urge to escape and see the world. When the humorless substitute teacher Ms. Malkin (Cecily Strong) tells the students that they each have to take one of the two creatures home for the weekend to learn responsibility, Leo sees his chance. He goes home with the chatty Summer (Sunny Sandler), and reveals that he can speak. Once each kid stops freaking out about bringing home a talking lizard, Leo turns into a life coach/therapist for them. Through old-school wisdom, the children learn lessons about kindness, acceptance and confidence. The script — by Sandler, Robert Smigel (“Saturday Night Live,” “Hotel Transylvania”) and Paul Sado (“Sandy Wexler”) — doesn’t break any new ground, but there are enough cute jokes, so-so musical numbers and visual gags to hold the interest of preschool- and elementary-aged kids.

The rest of the story is, like many of Jarman’s tales, a hallucinatory rummaging through the mind of a broken man.

us,Inside the Heritage Foundation’s Plans for ‘Institutionalizing Trumpism’,"Since taking over the Heritage Foundation in 2021, Kevin D. Roberts has been making his mark on an institution that came to prominence during the Reagan years and has long been seen as an incubator of conservative policy and thought. Roberts, who was not well known outside policy circles when he took over, has pushed the think tank away from its hawkish roots by arguing against funding the war in Ukraine, a turnabout that prompted some of Heritage’s policy analysts to leave. Now he’s looking ahead, to the 2024 election and beyond. Roberts told me that he views Heritage’s role today as “institutionalizing Trumpism.” This includes leading Project 2025, a transition blueprint that outlines a plan to consolidate power in the executive branch, dismantle federal agencies and recruit and vet government employees to free the next Republican president from a system that Roberts views as stacked against conservative power. The lesson of Trump’s first year in office, Roberts told me, is that “the Trump administration, with the best of intentions, simply got a slow start. And Heritage and our allies in Project 2025 believe that must never be repeated.”",2024-01-21T10:01:18+0000

us,The Team Behind August Gatherings Opens YAO in the Financial District,"From Canal Street to Wall Street, not so far in distance, sums up the ambition behind this new restaurant from Kenny Leung, a chef, and his business partner Thomas Tang. They established their first, August Gatherings, in Chinatown nearly 10 years ago with a Cantonese menu that had some creative twists. This time, they’re doubling down, adding additional global influences in a more formal setting and calling the food modern Cantonese. Mr. Leung, a native of Guangzhou who came to New York in 1988, pays homage with dishes like salt-baked chicken, several abalone preparations, fried rice with roasted eel, and Hong Kong style noodles with fish maw. But he will also be adding black truffles to his Cantonese shrimp dumplings, tossing octopus with fusilli, and using balsamic vinegar. Equipment like sous vide is also in his arsenal. “I’m preserving the integrity of Cantonese food but adding international ingredients and techniques,” he said. Among the desserts, he has successfully crossed the classic Chinese egg tart with the Portuguese nata, a similar confection that’s popular in Macau, and which he’s been serving at August Gatherings. Michael Goff, the beverage director, has assembled a tight list that starts at $50 but, with an eye on Wall Street, climbs to a $2,000 Burgundy. The restaurant’s fancy street entrance is next to the modest-looking Courtyard by Marriott, which houses the restaurant on its second floor. The large, airy, well-windowed space seating 168 in a main room and smaller private rooms, is fitted with banquettes and tables in quietly elegant tones of beige and salmon, with fake greenery and flowers and real Chinese ceramics.

us,A Red Velvet Bistro in an Istanbul Villa,"During the 49 years that Estée Lauder worked at her namesake company, she oversaw the creation of a dozen scents and encouraged women to create fragrance “wardrobes” tailored to every occasion and mood. The brand’s Legacy Collection, which comes out on Feb. 1, revives five of Lauder’s creations with the help of Frédéric Malle (whose perfume brand was acquired by the Estée Lauder Companies in 2015) and the perfumers Anne Flipo, Carlos Benaïm and Bruno Jovanovic, all of whom have worked with Malle on previous fragrances. During an interview inside Lauder’s well-preserved office near Central Park, Malle explained how he retooled the scents using more modern fragrance-making techniques. He noted that, in Lauder’s day, perfumers combined base scents that were “like premixed mini-perfumes” to create a final fragrance. “They contained things that weren’t necessary and created background noise,” Malle said. To update the formulas, any nonessential ingredients in those bases were stripped away — “it’s like cleaning up,” he said. The new collection has notes that range from fresh and herbaceous to musky and sweet. Azurée, initially released in 1969, evokes dry Mediterranean shores with herby notes like basil and tarragon as well as jasmine, spicy cardamom, bergamot, and cumin, which Malle amplified in his edition. For White Linen, a classic floral bouquet of rose and jasmine, Malle used pure labdanum, an ambery resin from the rockrose plant, which wasn’t available when the scent debuted in 1978. Knowing, a seductive scent from 1988, “contained a little bit of the Muzak of the ’80s,” Malle said. The modernized version is a fruity chypre with raspberries, black currant, rose and patchouli. The overall goal of the collection, Malle said, “is to revive this work and show how good Mrs. Lauder was.” The Legacy Collection is available from Feb. 1, $280, esteelauder.com.",2024-01-25T14:00:19+0000

I walked over to a large circular table laden with dozens of jars, each containing a different strain.

Rather than painstakingly analyzing each photo, tangled piece of jewelry or DVD in my box marked “mementos,” I set a timer for 30 minutes and discarded ruthlessly. It was difficult, but his grin was worth it. — Rachel Kramer Bussel",2024-01-30T20:00:19+0000

Yet, it is hard to comprehend the full scope of her talent because, like so many Broadway performers of her generation, much of her best work was not captured on-screen.
