us,Grand Illusionist,"Claudio Bravo, the Chilean-born realist artist who has a knack for making a crumpled piece of wrapping paper look like a 17th-century religious relic, came to success early in life. By 1972, at the age of 35, he was a well-established, sought-after portraitist living in Madrid, a darling of society. That year, lacking neither confidence nor funds, he traded in the high life for a monkish existence in Tangier, where he passed long ascetic days of work and solitude amid the luminous surroundings of his newly acquired seaside mansion. The paintings and drawings he produced there, many imbued with the color and texture of the Arab world, make up the bulk of the more than 200 reproductions in CLAUDIO BRAVO: Paintings and Drawings (Abbeville, $95). Arranged in more or less chronological order, the book traces his use of color, which seems to become more extravagant with the passage of time, and the increasingly mysterious arrangement of objects in his photo-perfect still lifes (a bowl of ostrich eggs, for example, alongside a yellow tulip, or a shower cap beside a tube of oil paint). Many of these drawings and paintings combine the precision of hyperrealism with the lush texture of a centuries-old classic, leaving one to ponder how, say, a rendering of a goat -- each strand of hair taken into account -- can mirror reality so acutely and, at the same time, transcend it. A 1995 interview with Bravo and fascinating introductory essays by two of his friends, the novelists Paul Bowles and Mario Vargas Llosa, provide insights into the life of this ''illusionist,'' as Vargas Llosa calls him, who causes objects to ''lose the insignificance they have in real life and become delicate creatures.''

As Americans watch the work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the moment may be right to consider whether a similar approach might be useful in the United States in certain narrowly defined situations. Unlike South Africa, whose new Government is still evolving, the United States has a fully developed and functioning criminal justice system. But it is also true that contemporary American society is still haunted by some unresolved questions that nag at the national conscience. Such questions, if left unresolved, promise to provide fodder for conspiracy theorists for decades to come.

In my experience, no ''troubled nurse,'' unless totally incompetent, would have administered a flagrantly incorrect dose of a potentially lethal drug having taken only the few steps Belkin described to check the error. We were trained in calculating correct doses in nursing school, and it was drummed into our heads that no matter what the doctor ordered, responsibility for the correctness of the dose lay in our hands, since we did the administering. In such a case, a nurse does not say to a doctor, ''Are you sure you want me to give this?'' but instead, ''You do realize this is 10 times the indicated dose, don't you?'' But even if she made this communications mistake, the next step would be to go to the head nurse or charge nurse. The head nurse then calls the resident, and if the resident is not available calls the attending to double-check. There are occasions when nonstandard dosages of medications are called for, but I have often seen ''troubled nurses'' say to doctors, ''Well, if that's the dose you want, you give it!''",1997-07-06T05:00:00+0000

When the Emanuel family avoided talking about Shoshana in detail and she herself declined to be interviewed, Bumiller should have realized that there was no story. Without a full account of the troubled adopted daughter to contrast with that of the highly accomplished biological sons, the article lapses into a banal showcase for the talents and temperaments of three smugly successful 30-somethings. Their feats are attributed to nothing more remarkable than high parental expectations. The nature-nurture issue slips between the reader's fingers, with statements about genetics and environment tantalizingly dangled but never developed. From the scant information provided, it sounds as if Shoshana's difficulties may have stemmed less from being adopted and more from having had brain-hemorrhage complications and overachieving older brothers -- circumstances that could just as easily have afflicted a biological child.",1997-07-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Do You Come Here Often?,"NIGHT OUT: Poems About Hotels, Motels, Restaurants, and Bars (Milkweed, paper, $14.95) is a clever homage to restless souls and creatures of the night. This anthology, edited by Kurt Brown and Laure-Anne Bosselaar, features the work of 125 contemporary poets in a surprising array of flavors and moods. You'll find everything here, from the dark (''We have all been in rooms / We cannot die in, and they are odd places, and sad,'' James Dickey writes in ''Adultery'') to the light (as in Bruce Berger's ''Dining Late'': ''There are no burnt croutons in the restaurants of Heaven. / No overindulgence of manna will put on weight. / Reservations are eternally held between seven / and half past eight''). Familiar names, like Raymond Carver, Derek Walcott and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, are well represented, but many lesser-known poets also shine, like Mark Cox in ''Inhospitable'': ''You, too, have walked the carpeted halls / with an empty ice bucket, pretending / to look for the machine, but really listening / for passion's channel / blaring from bolted-down, pre-set tvs.'' The poems are whimsically grouped by theme -- ''Rented Pleasures,'' ''Hamburger Heaven,'' ''Some Enchanted Evening'' and so on -- and while many readers may find themselves dipping in and out of this collection, it's hard to bypass titles like ''Vanna White's Bread Pudding,'' ''The Remarkable Objectivity of Your Old Friends'' and ''For the Barmaid Unhappy With the Size of Her Breasts.'' Many of the real gems are odes to transient hotels, seedy bars and all-night diners, dwelling on half-glimpsed trysts, clandestine gropings and the loneliness of late hours -- even as the poets are eager to see life, in the words of Chase Twichell, in the lovely ''Chanel No. 5,'' as ''a sort of gorgeous elegy / intimate with things about to be lost.''

But Hong Kongers look at events here with much more mixed emotion. For them, it's not Communism versus democracy, but nationalism versus the rule of law. That is, there is real ethnic pride here in the return of Chinese sovereignty, after 156 years of British colonialism. But there is also real fear that what Hong Kongers appreciated most about Britain's colonialism -- the rule of law -- will vanish along with it. As one Hong Kong businessman remarked to me on handover day: ''I feel torn -- like I just watched my mother-in-law drive out of town in my new Mercedes.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FINLEY, JOSEPH E.","FINLEY-Joseph E. Beloved and revered General Counsel Emeritus and historian for the Office and Professional Employees International Union died on July 8, 1997. Mr. Finley served the Union for Professional Technical and Clerical Employees for more than forty years. He advocated for OPEIU members in many court cases including several before the U.S. Supreme Court. He successfully argued the right of white collar employees of trade unions to organize and bargain collectively in OPEIU v. NLRB (353 US 313); and that the convention of the International Union could establish a minimum dues rate for local unions in Ranes v. OPEIU Local 28 (317 f.2d915). Besides chronicling the history of OPEIU in his book ''White Collar Union'' (1975), he was a prolific writer whose works include ''The Corrupt Kingdom'' (1973) on the United Mine Workers of America, the critically acclaimed novel, ''Missouri Blue'', which was part autobiographical, as well as several books on horse racing under a pseudonym. At the time of his death he was working on a book on the battle of Saratoga. Mr. Finley was born on August 7, 1919, to William V. and Nell (Whitten) Finely in Missouri. He was a graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism (1942) and Yale Law School (1951). He was a member of the bar of the United States Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Besides having a private practice, he was a partner of Metzenbaum, Gaines, Finley and Stern, in Cleveland, Ohio, 1961 to 1970. He was also General Counsel for the International Brotherhood of Pottery and Allied Workers, East Liverpool, Ohio, 1970 to 1983. He heroically served in World War II from 1942 to 1946 as one of the early liberators of concentration camp survivors in Dachau. He is survived by his wife, Doctor Joanne Finely, MD, his daughter and fellow lawyer, Lucinda Finley and his sons, Scott, William and Ethan Finley. We offer them our most heartfelt condolences. We thank them for generously sharing him with us for so very long. His loss to our International Union is immense. There was no more dedicated, insightful defender of workers' rights. He rigorously pursued justice and fairness in the workplace and a better way of life for all working people. He was and is an inspiration to all. He was our historian, our advocate, our adjudicator, our brother and our very gentle friend. May he rest in peace. There will be no service, although a memorial will be held in New York City in a few weeks. For information, call OPEIU at 212-675-3210.

us,$1.50 to La Guardia? Take the M-60,"SEVERAL recent trips between the Upper West Side of Manhattan and La Guardia Airport have convinced me that the M-60 bus, just five years old, is one of the best travel bargains in New York City. For the price of the regular bus fare of $1.50 in exact change, a token or a Metrocard, this little-heralded bus picks up passengers or drops them off at any of a number of stops in upper Manhattan and Queens and at La Guardia's major terminals, from Delta-Northwest to the Marine Air Terminal. Starting the Fourth of July, the bus became an even bigger bargain: Users of the new gold Metrocard can now transfer without charge (within a two-hour limit) from subways and all Transit Authority buses in Manhattan -- including the mainstay of the Upper West Side, the M-104, which runs on Broadway -- and from some Queens buses as well. The schedule of the M-60 is a classic of Cartesian regularity. As a rule, the buses operate every 20 minutes between 10 A.M. and 7 P.M. (every half hour from 4:30 to 10 A.M. and again from 7 P.M. to 12:30 A.M.), and travel time is about 50 minutes, depending on traffic. This compares favorably with just about any other form of public transportation to or from Manhattan. Recent bus trips in the direction of rush hour traffic between 106th Street and Broadway, the southern terminus, and La Guardia have shown that even with all the stops the bus makes along the way, the M-60 still covers the distance in about the same time as cars can manage.",1997-07-13T05:00:00+0000

(Yes, he said it. But in the same speech he said, J.F.K.-like, The chief ideal of the American people is idealism.) Whether the film will flutter many hearts remains to be seen, but Karol is a believer.

A mock-up for its $12 million campaign showed a tough New York businessmen with a line announcing that his city's safety rates right up there . . . with Boise. Alas, focus groups didn't buy it, perhaps sensing that per head comparisons don't always mean much. New York had 984 homicides in 1996; Boise had 1.

Donleavy -- and newcomers to his antics -- can rejoice at his latest rich, ribald and touching creation, THE LADY WHO LIKED CLEAN REST ROOMS: The Chronicle of One of the Strangest Stories Ever to Be Rumoured About Around New York (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $18.95). Mrs. Jocelyn Guenevere Marchantiere Jones sweeps onto the scene as the doyenne of an estimable house and fortune in Scarsdale. Although her South Carolinian, socially registered grandmother disapproved of anything above the Mason-Dixon line, Jocelyn still honors her code of behavior: ''Your snobberies are the most preciously valuable asset you will ever have in life, cherish them well. Avoid unbrave men and when you're away from your own trusted lavatory, only go to the cleanest of places.'' But Jocelyn's certainties are tested when her husband leaves her for a bit of ''fresh flesh.'' Ever the lady, Jocelyn proposes modest terms for the divorce and holds her course through financial collapse. What follows is a freewheeling tour of our heroine's ''unexpurgated thoughts'' as fortune bounces her down the peculiar social ladder that separates Scarsdale from Yonkers, Yonkers from the Bronx -- and the New World nouveaux riches from the ''dignified homeless indigent.'' Donleavy proves himself as much the master of a certain New York social set and train corridor as he is of the psyche of a fresh-mouthed 43-year-old Daughter of the Confederacy. The reader cheers for Jocelyn as she fends off her friends' husbands, brandishes a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson and lives for her trips to Manhattan's museums. But her search for the city's cleanest restrooms becomes increasingly desperate, leading Jocelyn finally to a funeral parlor and a quite shocking reversal of fate. Eight elegant line drawings by Elliott Banfield complement Donleavy's slim text, depicting moments of scandal with a restraint that would do Jocelyn's grandmother proud.

us,On a Clear Day You Can See Florence,"For almost 60 years, Bernard and Mary Berenson's villa at Settignano, outside Florence, was dedicated to the art of connoisseurship and the craft of entertaining. When he willed the place to Harvard University as a center for Renaissance studies, Berenson envisioned it as a ''lay monastery of leisurely culture''; Mary, never keen on the idea, grumbled that it would more likely be a ''wayside inn for loafing scholars.'' After reading William Weaver's text in A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE: The Story of Villa I Tatti (Abrams, $49.50) and poring over David Finn's and David Morowitz's enticing photographs, you can't help thinking that in a perfect world I Tatti ought to be both. A highly refined attention to sybaritic detail does seem to have been an integral part of the house's history. Weaver tells us that while in hiding at an Italian nobleman's villa during World War II, Berenson insisted on sending his monogrammed shirts back to I Tatti by bicycle to be properly laundered, even when a German general had taken up residence. Mary once fired a coachman who pilfered violets and who threatened the cook ''because he was given polenta to eat.'' And rewards were certainly in order for the young architect who survived his hostess's tour of the local museums. ''He did not,'' Mary reported, ''make a single banal remark, or admire anything wrong.'' But maybe it's best to let her husband have the last word. ''My ideal,'' he wrote in his will concerning the future inhabitants of I Tatti, ''is that they should become ripe humanists.'' We should all be so lucky. Alida Becker",1997-07-13T05:00:00+0000

She was an esteemed endocrinologist who was considered an authority on the management of patients with Addison's Disease of which her knowledge was encyclopedic.

She was adored by her patients, revered by her students and admired by her peers for the quality of her care and the depth of her caring. In 1986 she was awarded the Alumni Medal for Outstanding Service, and in 1990 Columbia's Alumni Federation Medal. In 1991 she was presented the Arnold Gold Foundation Award which is given to a physician who has demonstrated compassionate and devoted patient care and who has served as a humanistic role model for students and young physicians. She held almost every office in the Alumni Association, most notably Annual Fund Chairman from 1982-1997, 1942 Class Chairman from 1978-1997, & President from 1993-95. Her innovative leadership, wise counsel & dedicated service to her Alma Mater were a continuing source of pride to her colleagues in the Alumni Association.

Quite apart from her distinguished contributions to a basic understanding of adrenal gland physiology and the early management of patients with Addison's disease which were formerly recognized in her election to membership in The American Society for Clinical Investigation, Dr. Knowlton served as an incomparable role model for all those fortunate to be associated with her. Wise, vigilant, faithful and tender in her care of patients, she taught by quiet but telling example what it is to be a physician and friend. To the end, despite a long and trying personal illness, she set a standard for others in her continuing care for patients, her kindness, her quick and perceptive interest in others and her unflagging courage and good spirits. She was a gallant, unfailingly gracious and universally beloved teacher and colleague whose passing leaves an aching void and who is greatly mourned. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, Dr. Kenneth Calder, to her son, Thomas Calder and to her daughter, Mary Calder Johnstone. Myron L. Weisfeldt, M.D. Chairman, Department of Medicine College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University",1997-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Haunted by a terrible childhood accident, the specifics of which are revealed only in the final pages, the Duke occupies his days meandering about his estate, philosophizing on matters great and small, delving into his own psyche and startling his staff and neighbors. The Duke's most remarked-upon eccentricity is his obsession with tunnels: he has carefully built a wide-ranging network of them beneath his lands, allowing him free and hidden access to all parts of his realm. But Jackson's tightly written narrative, in the form of the Duke's journals, with the occasional testimony of various bystanders, focuses more on the man's often hilarious hypochondria, his bright if useless observations (like the ''precise impracticabilities of one year sticking all the fallen leaves back into the trees'') and his inevitable descent into madness. It is difficult not to sympathize with the Duke, but equally easy to feel the discomfort and trepidation that fill those who move through his tiny universe -- including his faithful aide, Clement, and his neighbor, Mellor, a clergyman and amateur archeologist. A kind of climax comes in a grotesque yet gripping scene when the Duke performs brain surgery on himself, drilling a coin-sized hole in his skull and reaching in to feel his brain, his ''little box of tricks,'' in a failed effort at final relief. A skilled writer blending fact -- the tunnels, at least, exist -- and highly imaginative fiction, Jackson has produced a marvelous study of human foibles and done justice to the memory of a very strange man.

us,One traveler's twist on Goldilocks,"Growing up in close proximity to the rich, the New England rich anyway, has a peculiar effect on the psyche. It does not, as one might expect, drive one to extravagance. On the contrary, it drives one to stinginess. I spent too many years watching my town's millionaires attending weddings in their sneakers not to grow up believing that the classiest consumption is the least conspicuous. When I travel my conviction does not hold true for meals -- I like to eat well -- but almost without exception my hotels have been, if not quite hell, suburbs of purgatory. It's easiest to travel that way when you have only yourself to think of.",1997-07-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Don't Blame the Printer,"In 1992, Ray Gun, an alternative rock-and-roll magazine, earned a reputation for radical graphic presentation that so challenged the conventions of legibility that its texts were reduced to textures. Its raucous graphic design set the standard for a kind of hip style of typographic tomfoolery that soon became the rave with countless other alternative-culture publications and on posters, packages and music videos. The traditional type hierarchies -- headlines, subheads, body text and page numbers -- were rejected in favor of unrelenting randomness. Text was allowed to bleed off the page in the middle of a paragraph, and in one issue an entire article was printed backward in an illegible typeface. Ray Gun's first art director, David Carson, and his small army of designers made pages that were more like Abstract Expressionist canvases than magazine layouts. Rather than communicate ideas, they created auras that gave an impression of expression. The magazine was the harbinger of visual codes for the post-baby-boom generation, and it remains the granddaddy of edgy graphic magazines as well as a document of its time. But RAY GUN: Out of Control (Simon & Schuster, $45), a celebratory compendium of covers and pages from the magazine and its sister publications, Bikini, Blah Blah Blah, huH and Stick, is not the best way to document this trend. This book, edited by Dean Kuipers and Chris Ashworth, looks more like a collection of printers' errors than a book. And although the graphics are punctuated by interesting essays on the magazine's brief history, they are lost amid the confusing morass of type and image. Now that the Ray Gun style has been adapted for mainstream television and print advertisements, this assemblage is more confusing than outrageous. Steven Heller",1997-07-20T05:00:00+0000

Or preserving the ancient mounds of oyster shells along the Maine coast for $364,000. Such projects occur because the law requires states to spend some of the Federal highway money they receive on historic preservation, with a stipulation being that the site must be visible from the road. Applying that concept liberally, one affected roadside site is the West Virginia state Capitol, recipient of a $620,000 spiff-up.

One can't help coming away with an impression that anyone who hits the road solo starts off with a serious handicap, and that those who aren't joined in bedlock or bound to an affinity group are in danger of that dread modern social disease solitude. But with all due respect for the sensitivities of the unmarried, divorced or widowed, it seems to me that setting out on one's own has inherent advantages that deserve to be considered even by people who have a choice in the matter.",1997-07-20T05:00:00+0000

Avocation: Lifeguard,"MIKE SHAPIRO, having called on a dozen clients between Mystic and Old Saybrook, including two at Ocean Beach in New London, would appear to have put in a full day's work. But it was only noon on a recent Monday, and there, perched on a lifeguard stand at Ocean Beach, not far from the boardwalk concession where he had made his last client call of the day, was Mr. Shapiro.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  SONDERLING, EGMONT","SONDERLING-Egmont. We have lost a loving husband, a father and a grandfather-our beloved Egmont Sonderling. To those of us who loved him, his kindness and concern for others will forever be in our hearts. Egmont's life is the story of faith, hard work, dedication and commitment. We will all cherish the memories of how he expressed his feelings to each of us in his quiet, unassuming way. Egmont's journey to America, almost 75 years ago, began on an oil tanker which crossed the Atlantic Ocean. He came to Chester, Pennsylvania. As millions of European immigrants had done, Egmont came to the United States because he heard and believed that here the streets were paved with gold. He very much wanted to participate in the American Dream. He would often remark that when he first saw New York City he was simply overwhelmed. Over the years, his faith centered him in the belief that G-d must have been on his side. Egmont never forgot that just ten years after his arrival in America, the horror of Nazi Germany would be unleashed against his beloved people and all of mankind. Egmont Sonderling's destiny took him to Chicago where he became a visionary in the emerging fields of broadcasting, entertainment and advertising. In the ensuing 65 years, he built a company that would become one of the world's pioneer group broadcasting corporations, covering 11 major markets. His success touched a large chain of movie theaters in New England and New York. In 1980, the majority of his then publicly owned Sonderling Broadcast Corporation was merged in to Viacom International. Throughout these years of active, creative leadership, this wonderful man always remembered his humble origins, always remembered his family, was always concerned for the quality of life for all people. Egmont was truly forever grateful for the opportunities he found in America. His enthusiasm for life was unbounded. His life's experience instilled within him a deep, principled commitment to give something back to the people in the communities where he lived. He decided early on that his success was to be shared with others and he derived a tremendous sense of joy in being able to support many causes across the nation and around the world. Egmont Sonderling had a special feeling for the residents, tenants and clients of the Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged at Douglas Gardens. He was always conscious of his heritage and grateful that he had been given the opportunity to escape the years of horror in Germany. In this way, as both a philanthropist and as a Board Member, he was deeply involved with an organization which aids Jewish elderly and which provides care to thousands of Floridians of all races, religions and creeds. Our beloved Egmont earned a reputation as a most generous host in his support of a long list of other worthy causes as well: medical research, the handicapped, and the arts, especially the Opera and Ballet. He became a Crown Jewel during the Golden Anniversary Season of the Opera and also served as Co-Chair of the Grand Opera Ball. Those of us who mourn this loving, decent and honorable man will cherish the bright dreams he dreamed and the love which we will share always. Survived by his devoted wife Marjorie Serralles Sonderling, loving children Roy and Bonnie Sonderling, Annik Serralles Wolf and Michael, Juan E. Serralles, IV and Rita, Marjorie E.

us,Images of Private Dreams,"A collection of crisp portraits and soft-focus landscapes taken from 1977 to 1996, THE SILVER CORD (Scalo/DAP, $45) is a kind of austere, arid diary of the photographer David Armstrong's life. He has frozen the beauty of his friends -- mostly gay men, along with a few women and people of indeterminate sex -- in cool, classical poses, calm and patient and private. His subjects sit quietly in somberly lighted rooms with wistful expressions on their faces. In one series, Armstrong's lover placidly embodies various images of gay sexuality: posed as a sailor, in a dog collar, on a bed with velvet-soft window light caressing his face, his shoulders, the marbly veins in his hands. The blurry landscapes look like abandoned portraits -- the people have all gone away, leaving behind empty streets and gardens. In these photographs, instead of creating sharp, legible images, Armstrong makes misty, moody, painterly pictures that drag the viewer in, back into private memories and dreams. Some of these uninhabited spaces seem more alive than the pictures with people: we never learn much more about personalities than that they are lovely. Armstrong's portraits seal a perfect past in amber, while his diaphanous landscapes beckon with the promise of possibility. Jake Miller",1997-07-27T05:00:00+0000

At 5 feet 10 inches with long blond hair, green eyes and an underbite that often makes her look as if she's half-smiling, Jill cuts an imposing figure for 16; she is the sort of girl boys notice instantly and are sometimes afraid of. And the fear is mutual, despite her air of confidence.",1997-07-27T05:00:00+0000

She tried valiantly to divert us with alternatives -- Sterling Castle, perhaps, or a day trip to Arran. But we were insistent. We had come to Scotland, in early spring, to visit Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott's estate in the Border Country. It was a pilgrimage of a kind, to celebrate my husband's completion, after years of delighted absorption, of ''The Surgeon's Daughter,'' the final volume in the collected works of the dean of Scottish literature.

Carol Smith, the narrator as well as the heroine of the story, was an accessory to an undergraduate bomb plot in the early 1970's; for this she was sent to prison, where she suffered a mental collapse. And after 20 years of confinement, she winds up in a shabby room in Spanish Harlem, under the intermittent care of an unstable social worker. Confronted with the New York of the 1990's, Carol soon finds herself wandering the streets. Although the novel provides a frank, unbiased exploration of homelessness, its strength is at times undercut by the flimsiness of its plot. Yet Calisher's vibrant, erratic rhythms make Carol's observations continually surprising. ''In the Slammer with Carol Smith'' is as jazzy as its title. If you're willing to look past the vagaries of its plotting to its remarkable prose, Calisher's book will yield ample rewards. Emily Barton",1997-07-27T05:00:00+0000

A woman of great wit and warmth who loved people and politics, words and music, grammar and syntax, but above all, family and friends, died peacefully Friday at her home in North Salem, NY. She was eightynine. Born Dorothy Evelyn Paddock on May 17, 1908, she was the daughter of Ellen Meehan Paddock and Lewis Nathan Paddock of Providence, RI. There she graduated from famed Classical High School and later from The Katherine Gibbs School. Subsequently, she worked for the Providencebased Paddock Paper Company and continued her musical studies. She was an accomplished pianist and vocalist when she met and in 1933 married James Edward Downey of Hartford, CT. The couple lived in Providence until 1940. Dorothy and James Downey were blessed with four sons and then two daughters. As she would with her grandchildren a generation later, Dorothy imbued her children with an individual sense of uniqueness, values and fair play. She made each person she touched feel like the most important being in the world. The Downeys lived in the New Haven area throughout the 1940s and afterwards in Concord, MA. In 1954 they moved to Darien, CT. Some years later, following her husband's death in 1969, Dorothy relocated to her home in North Salem. Mrs. Downey is survived by her children: Dr. James L. Downey, a pediatrician of Winnetka, IL; Robert N. Downey, partner Goldman Sachs of NY; Steven M. Downey, Chairman DWT, Inc., of NY; Paul A. Downey, President of Downey Capital, of San Francisco; Eleanor Downey Martinez, former Senior Editor at NetRadio of NY; and Caroline Downey Abrams, Chief of Legislation and Legal Opinions, NYS Division of Human Rights, also of NY; a sister, Eleanor Paddock LaBonne, of Somers, NY; 19 grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

A woman of great wit and warmth who loved people and politics, words and music, grammar and syntax, but above all, family and friends, died peacefully Friday at her home in North Salem, NY. She was eightynine. Born Dorothy Evelyn Paddock on May 17, 1908, she was the daughter of Ellen Meehan Paddock and Lewis Nathan Paddock of Providence, RI. There she graduated from famed Classical High School and later from The Katherine Gibbs School. Subsequently, she worked for the Providencebased Paddock Paper Company and continued her musical studies. She was an accomplished pianist and vocalist when she met and in 1933 married James Edward Downey of Hartford, CT. The couple lived in Providence until 1940. Dorothy and James Downey were blessed with four sons and then two daughters. As she would with her grandchildren a generation later, Dorothy imbued her children with an individual sense of uniqueness, values and fair play. She made each person she touched feel like the most important being in the world. The Downeys lived in the New Haven area throughout the 1940s and afterwards in Concord, MA. In 1954 they moved to Darien, CT. Some years later, following her husband's death in 1969, Dorothy relocated to her home in North Salem. Mrs. Downey is survived by her children: Dr. James L. Downey, a pediatrician of Winnetka, IL; Robert N. Downey, partner Goldman Sachs of NY; Steven M. Downey, Chairman DWT, Inc., of NY; Paul A.
