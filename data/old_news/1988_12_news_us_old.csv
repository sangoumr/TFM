Philadelphia's Charles Barkley, who finished with 31 points, made a driving layup at the buzzer, but the basket was nullified when Barkley was called for a foul to end the game. Tripucka led the Hornets with 25. (AP) Hawks 127, Bullets 115: Dominique Wilkins, with 36 points, put the Hawks in front and kept them there most of the night as Atlanta won its sixth straight home game. Wilkins's 11-foot baseline jumper with 8:11 remaining in the second quarter put the Hawks ahead for good. Atlanta got 23 points from Moses Malone. John Williams led the Bullets with 30 points.(AP) Cavaliers 99, Bucks 96: Mark Price hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 29 seconds left and Ron Harper scored 28 points as Cleveland rallied for the victory in Milwaukee. Price's shot made it 93-90 and his two free throws with 16 seconds to go gave Cleveland a 95-92 lead. The Bucks' Jay Humphries made a long jumper with 13 seconds left but Harper and Brad Daugherty made two free throws each. (AP) College Basketball Fordham 78, Hofstra 64: Andre McClendon hit all five of his 3-point shots in scoring 21 points and Joe Paterno added 20 for Fordham last night. Dan O'Sullivan had 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Rams (2-0). Carlos Dicenta had 25 points for the Flying Dutchmen (1-2), including five 3-pointers in six attempts. The Rams led by 41-23 at halftime. Hofstra got to 52-44 after a Dicenta 3-pointer with 9:44 left, but Fordham went on a 12-2 run to put the game away. (AP) B.C. 90, New Hampshire 76: Dana Barros scored 32 points, including five 3-pointers last night for Boston College. In the first half, Barros's long-range shooting helped Boston College (2-1) to a 22-14 lead with 12 minutes left. But New Hampshire fought back behind the shooting of Bob Cummins to tie at 38-38 at halftime. Doug Able scored 12 of his 15 points within the first nine minutes of the second half as the Eagles gained control at 60-51.(AP) Horse Racing Dancing Spree Rallies to Win: Dancing Spree, ridden by Julian Vazquez, rallied in the stretch and scored a four-length victory in yesterday's feature race for 3-year-olds and up at Aqueduct. Fluorescent Lou was runner-up in the field of five. Dancing Spree, the odds-on favorites, covered a mile and an eighth on the fast track in 1:51 1/5 and earned $17,400 for Ogden Phipps. The winner returned $3.20 for $2.(AP) Golf Sheehan and Haas Lead: Patty Sheehan and Jay Haas overcame gusty winds to shoot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday for a one-stroke lead in the J. C. Penney Classic at Largo, Fla. Sheehan, who finished second to Sherri Turner on the L.P.G.A. Tour money list this year with $326,171, and Haas, who ranked 20th on the PGA Tour season with $490,409, are the highest-ranked pair in the tournament. The brother-sister team of Larry and Laurie Rinker finished the par-72 North Course at the Bardmoor Country Club with a 66. (AP) College Football Alabama 30, Texas A&M 10: David Smith threw two short touchdown passes, and Philip Doyle kicked three field goals to establish an Alabama season record as the 20th-ranked Crimson Tide beat Texas A&M last night in Jackie Sherrill's 81st, and perhaps last, game as coach of the Aggies. The Alabama linebacker Derrick Thomas, the Butkus Award winner as the nation's top linebacker, had four sacks and recovered a fumble. Alabama, which will play Army in the Sun Bowl, improved its record to 8-3 while Texas A&M dropped to 7-5 in the game in College Station, Tex. The Aggies cut into a 10-point Alabama halftime lead on Robert Wilson's 1-yard touchdown run in the third period. But Smith hit Kevin Turner with an 8-yard pass; Doyle kicked a 30-yard field goal, and Murry Hill ran 10 yards to score in the fourth period to put the game away for Alabama. Sherrill's future at Texas A&M remains under a cloud because of a school investigation of payoff accusations by a former player, George Smith, who later recanted his statement. Bill Curry, the Alabama coach, was informed before the game that his contract would be honored through 1992. Alabama officials made the gesture as a vote of confidence to stem rumors that Curry would be dismissed. The Texas A&M-Alabama game was originally scheduled for Sept. 17, but Alabama couldn't come to College Station because of Hurricane Gilbert. (AP)",1988-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Oct. 20, 1988: An investment group led by F. Ross Johnson, Nabisco's chief executive, in partnership with the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, proposes a $17 billion leveraged buyout at $75 a share. Oct. 24: Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, Wall Street's leader in leveraged buyouts, tops the record bid with a $20.43 billion offer. Oct. 25: Shearson and Kohlberg, Kravis consider a combined bid. Oct. 26: Competition heats up as a joint deal is rejected. Oct. 27: Salomon Brothers joins Shearson as a backer in the management-led offer. Kolhberg, Kravis begins its tender offer for $90 a share. Oct. 28: RJR Nabisco agrees to give Kolberg, Kravis confidential financial data about its operations. Nov. 1: RJR's chairman, Charles E. Hugel, said it is highly likely that the company will be sold. Stock rises $1.25, to $85 a share. Several Kohlberg, Kravis investors balk at allowing the firm to use their cash in a RJR Nabisco buyout because of a possible hostile takeover and because of RJR Nabisco's ties to South Africa. Nov. 2: The two suitors tentatively agree to join forces. Nov. 3: The agreement fails; Mr. Johnson's group raises the stakes with a $92-a-share counteroffer of $20.9 billion. Nov. 4: Forstmann Little indicates it might join the battle with a higher bid. Shearson accuses Forstmann of breach of promise. Nov. 8: RJR Nabisco discloses formal rules for its sale, indicates it might sell its food divisions on its own and sets Nov. 18 as a deadline for bids. Nov. 11: Kohlberg, Kravis extends its tender offer by 10 days, to Dec. 5. Nov. 16: Field narrows as Forstmann Little declines to enter the auction; RJR Nabisco's stock tumbles $4.50, to $84. ITT, which holds RJR Nabisco bonds, sues RJR Nabisco and Mr. Johnson over the decline in the bonds' value. Nov. 18: RJR Nabisco management and Kohlberg, Kravis deliver bids before the 5 P.M. deadline of $22.7 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively. A surprise tentative offer of $23.8 billion to $26.8 billion comes from group led by First Boston, which is aligned with the Pritzker family of Chicago. Financing for that offer is uncertain. Nov. 19: Potential buyers spend the day explaining their complex bids to the company. Nov. 20: Special committee running the auction announces a new deadline, Nov. 29., for reformulated proposals. Nov. 29: Three suitors submit final bids of more than $100 a share. Management offers $22.9 billion, Kohlberg, Kravis offers $24 billion and First Boston offers $23.38 to $26.11. Stock price jumps $1.875, to $90.875. Nov. 30: Kohlberg, Kravis claims victory for the staggering price of $24.88 billion, or $109 a share. Mr. Johnson's group char",1988-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 The U.N. General Assembly voted to move its current session to Geneva later this month so that Yasir Arafat can address it. Mr. Arafat has been denied entry to the United States. 1 Soviets citizens have been denied refugee status in the United States because they could not demonstrate ''a well-founded fear of persecution,'' Federal officials said. 1 A Chinese-Soviet summit meeting will take place in the first half of next year, the two sides announced after a meeting between the Chinese Foreign Minister and Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow. 1 A massacre of Guatemalan peasants last week in which 22 civilians were tortured and strangled to death was carried out by leftist guerrillas, villagers said. A leading guerrilla group denied the charge. 3 South Africa released the editor of a prominent anti-apartheid newspaper after holding him without charges for two years. But the authorities immediately put the journalist, Zwelakhe Sisulu, under tough new restrictions. 4 American Jews have visited Israel in great numbers and with surprising spontaneity in the month since the Israeli elections. They are fighting an effort by Orthodox Jewish parties to amend Israel's Law of Return. 6 The White House charged the Soviets with five minor violations of the new accord to ban medium- and shorter-range missiles but said all the infractions have been corrected or are being resolved. 5 France said it will end an embargo against the purchase of Iranian oil by French companies in the latest manifestation of growing trade ties between Iran and Western Europe. 35 National 8-12, 28, 52 More than 450,000 jobs were created in November, indicating a strong economy. Because the number of people looking for work also increased, the unemployment rate edged up a tenth of a point. 1 Unemployment in New York State climbed slightly in November, to a rate of 4.6 percent, while New Jersey's rate remained at 3.9 percent, the Government reported. 12 The space shuttle Atlantis launched into orbit on a mission to deploy a reconnaisance satellite after swiftly taking advantage of a lull in the menacing high-altitude winds. 1 President-elect Bush will review his options and strategies for tackling the Federal deficit in a meeting with his senior advisers on Sunday, Mr. Bush's aides said. 10 News analysis: A Bush-Dukakis meeting completed a week in which the President-elect has reached out to political opponents of both parties to establish a theme of conciliation. 10 Investment for biotechnology is becoming scarce after billions of dollars have been directed to the hope of creating revolutionary products. Experts say the shortfall comes at a time of critical need. 35 George Mitchell's ''fondest hope'' as the new Senate Majority Leader, he said, is to find a way to schedule formal major policy debates on the Senate floor that would evoke the drama of a parliamentary body. 10 An air safety directive to review takeoff warning systems was not received by the chief Federal inspector for Delta Air Lines until more than two months after it was issued and several days after a Delta jet crash, the inspector said. 28 Ohio has the first claim to resources the Federal Government has devoted to repairing environmental damage at nuclear weapon plants, state environmental officials asserted. 8 Basic flaws in computer security similar to the one that let a rogue program jam a nationwide computer network are far more common than is generally believed, system designers say. 8 Serum from healthy AIDS carriers that had been injected into patients ill with AIDS apparently cleared the virus from the patients' blood, two studies have found. They do not show whether the treatment can prolong lives. 9 A blood bank in San Francisco has become the first such repository in the nation to be successfully sued for providing blood tainted with the AIDS virus to a patient who later developed the disease. 9 New-home sales jumped in October to the highest level since February 1987, the Government said, surprising analysts who have been expecting the rise in interest rates this year to dampen sales. 35 Having agreed to buy RJR Nabisco, Henry R. Kravis and another partner of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company flew to RJR Nabisco's headquarters in Atlanta to begin rebuilding morale. 35 Regional 29-32 Lilco said it was no longer bound to Governor Cuomo's plan to close the Shoreham nuclear plant, which the New York State Legislature has not adopted. The utility filed for an emergency rate increase. 1 News analysis: The State Legislature in New York has engineered what is probably Governor Cuomo's greatest defeat in Albany by refusing to approve his plan to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant. 32 Joel Steinberg told Hedda Nussbaum hours after Lisa Steinberg had been fatally injured that he had ''knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get up,'' Ms. Nussbaum said at the Steinberg trial. 29 Asbestos in New York City can be found in about two-thirds of all buildings, said a study issued by Mayor Koch, who proposed new laws to remove or contain the potentially disease-causing fibers. 29 People hoping to win the state lottery in New York have spent more than $12 million a day on Lotto tickets since Thursday, their eyes on the $45 million jackpot in tonight's drawing. It is the largest in the state's history. 29 American treatments for alcoholism have been studied by five Soviet doctors on a visit to the United States.

Whatever the concoction in the bowl - and some can be, well, startling - it is invariably called a punch, a tradition dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, the golden age of rum. Rum was almost always mixed with other things and served in a bowl. But not the huge centerpiece bowls (with matching ladles) we have come to expect.

us,OLD-FASHIONED AND UP TO DATE,"HOME COOKING (Knopf, $17.95), by the novelist Laurie Colwin, is as much memoir as cookbook and as much about eating as cooking. The recipes are for the kinds of things your mother used to make: baked beans with Boston brown bread, pot roast, potato pancakes -savory, filling and labor-intensive. There is a chapter titled ''Easy Cooking for Exhausted People,'' which offers a recipe for vegetarian chili calling for four kinds of beans - one to be found at the health food store, another at the Indian store! I guess some of us are more exhausted than others. But never mind: even without the recipes, ''Home Cooking'' makes a comfy read. I decided to lean back and trust Ms. Colwin when she revealed that ''I am never on a diet regime I cannot be talked out of.'' Not a fussy eater herself, Ms. Colwin nevertheless has remarkable patience with those who are, even offering tips on how to feed friends of the macrobiotic persuasion. She suggests steamed vegetables with green sauce; if necessary, omit the garlic from the green sauce, though some of us would just as soon omit the friends. Ms. Colwin understands that ''when people enter the kitchen, they often drag their childhood in with them,'' and she devotes a chapter to ''Nursery Food,'' a form of edible therapy. Many of her favorite foods are of the consoling variety. There's even a passage in ''Home Cooking'' on how to make perfect scrambled eggs if you happen to have 40 minutes to spare. As she points out, ''Man cannot live on charred monkfish and grilled baby vegetables alone.'' Old-fashioned in her food preferences, Ms. Colwin otherwise has been perfectly in tune with the Zeitgeist. During the 1968 student strike at Columbia University, she cooked for hungry comrades in an occupied building. Now she battles incipient hypertension with a low-salt diet, bakes homemade bread for her young daughter and is volunteer chef in a soup kitchen for homeless women. All of these experiences are chronicled in plain, digestible yet satisfying prose.",1988-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Like President, Mr. Previte's group - featuring Jerome Harris on bass and guitar, Allan Jaffe on guitar, Steve Gaboury on keyboards - works an area heavily influenced by pop and instrumental music from the 70's.

The remaining 232 acres would be divided into 49 country lots that follow natural divisions rather than a superimposed grid. The developers will build on some of the lots, which will range from 3 to 30 acres, and sell others with deed restrictions on the size and style of the houses.

Feed Materials Production Center: Fernald, Ohio Two silos are filled with 390,000 cubic feet of radioactive wastes that emit deadly radon gas. The plant has also released more than 300,000 pounds of uranium oxide and has contaminated drinking water wells. The Hanford Reservation: Near Richland, Wash. Liquid radioactive and toxic wastes were dumped in trenches from the time the plant opened in 1944 until the early 1980's. The wastes have contaminated large underground reservoirs used for drinking water and irrigation. Idaho National Engineering Laboratory: Near Idaho Falls The plant, which reprocesses nuclear fuel and operates experimental reactors, has discharged radioactive and toxic wastes into unlined waste lagoons. From there the waste has leached into the Snake River Aquifer, a giant underground reservoir. The Kansas City Plant: Kansas City, Mo. The plant, which produces electronic components for weapons, has contaminated soil and sewer lines with PCB's by discharging the cancer-causing chemicals into pits. The plant also released 240 tons of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: Livermore, Calif. One of the principal national weapon laboratories. The site has leached toxic contamination from other operations into the ground water. The contamination is expected to migrate to nearby residential communties dependent on ground water. Los Alamos National Laboratory: Los Alamos, N. M. Test firings of high explosives have contaminated the test area with uranium. Chemicals and radioactive particles have been found on the site. Mound Facility: Miamisburg, Ohio Waste pits at the site, which manufactures high explosives and plutonium components for satellites, are believed to be leaching toxic chemicals into soil. Officials are concerned about plutonium leaching into ground water. Nevada Test Site: Near Las Vegas The site is where nuclear weapons were tested above ground until 1961 and below ground since then. About 75 square miles of the site is thoroughly contaminated with radioactive materials from these tests, including plutonium, cesium and strontium. Pantex Facility: Amarillo, Tex. Thousands of gallons of toxic solvents from the plant, the final assembly point for nuclear warheads, were discharged into a giant unlined waste pit from 1954 to 1980. The chemicals are believed to be leaking into the Ogallala Aquifer, the primary drinking water source for Amarillo. Pinellas Plant: Largo, Fla. The plant produces mechanical components for weapons. Underground storage tanks containing chemical compounds are believed to be leaking. Portsmouth Uranium Enrichment Complex: Piketon, Ohio Roughly 36 pounds of cancer-causing and toxic hexavalent chromium used in the process of enriching uranium for reactor fuel, is being released to the atmosphere daily through the plant's cooling towers. Rocky Flats Plant: Near Golden, Colo. The plant, which processes plutonium for weapons, is leaking volatile, cancer-causing organic chemicals into underground water north of Denver. Soil around the site is contaminated with plutonium at elevated levels. Sandia National Laboratories: Albquerque, N.M., Livermore, Calif., and north of Las Vegas. Miles of desert near the Nevada site are contaminated with hazardous materials used at the laboratories since the early 1940's. Underground storage tanks have leaked. Open lagoons are receiving contaminated wastes and may be leaking. Savannah River Plant: Near Aiken, S.C. The plant, which produces radioactive tritium and plutonium for nuclear weapons, has released millions of curies of tritium gas into the atmosphere from accidents. A primary aquifer in the area has been contaminated with solvents. Y-12 Plant: Oak Ridge, Tenn. The plant fabricates weapon components. It has polluted streams with mercury. A pond at the plant containing arsenic, boron and sulfate is leaking into surface streams. Crops and livestock may be contaminated by poisonous releases into the atmosphere.",1988-12-07T05:00:00+0000

''A Charles Dickens Christmas,'' a one-act family musical presented by Theaterworks/USA at the Promenade Theater, takes some of the basic biographical facts of Dickens's life and imagines how the author might have woven them into the story as we know it. As the show opens, Dickens (Warren Kelley) is presented as a harried, Scrooge-like figure, indifferent to Christmas, rushing to meet deadlines, and barely able to squelch his fury at a financially exploitative father (Trip Plymale) and a threatening taskmaster of a publisher (Don Stephenson).",1988-12-08T05:00:00+0000

''The league and team officials apparently did little to stop Duper's association with the dealers,'' the magazine said. The National Football League last week suspended Duper for 30 days for violating the league's substance abuse policy. ''I was very disturbed,'' Shula said, ''by the implication that I was aware of alleged drug use or consorting with drug dealers and didn't do anything about it. As soon as I was aware of the photographs that were taken of two of our ballplayers with two convicted drug dealers, I immediately made the league security department aware of this and called the ballplayers in. I talked to them about having their pictures taken with these convicted drug dealers. And that was the extent of what I could do.'' Duper was warned to stay away from Aguilar after a photo surfaced showing the two men and a former Dolphin, Nat Moore, the team's security consultant, Stuart Weinstein, said.

Jan. 30: The army begins severely beating hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children in a declared policy that it defends as more humane than using live ammunition.

Israel dismisses the declaration as irrelevant and smothers planned celebrations. Dec. 7: Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, says in Stockholm that the P.L.O. accepts the existence of Israel. The statement is dismissed in Israel and greeted coldly in the United States. Dec. 8: On the anniversary of the start of the uprising, soldiers shoot and kill Youssef Mohammed Subaih, 17, during demonstrations in the West Bank. Palestinians begin a two-day general strike in observance of the anniversary of the uprising.",1988-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 Mikhail Gorbachev was assured at his luncheon meeting with President Reagan and President-elect Bush that the United States wished him success with his economic initiatives, Administration officials said. 1 The Soviet Union accepted U.S. aid in coping with the earthquake in Armenia, marking the first time that large-scale American aid will be sent to the Soviet Union since the the two countries were allies in World War II. 1 News analysis: Armenia's quake is certain to cost huge amounts of money, manpower and resources, frustrating Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to revive the economy and reshape the country. 7 NATO praised Soviet plans to reduce conventional forces in Europe but added that a shift in Moscow's nonnuclear posture should not affect NATO plans for short-range nuclear missiles. 7 Israeli ground troops destroyed part of what they said was a Palestinian guerrilla headquarters after landing by sea south of Beirut and marching two miles into central Lebanon, Israeli officials said. 1 A U.S.-European Community clash over agricultural trade barriers prompted nations at a GATT conference to order a four-month reassessment of efforts to revamp the world trading system. 35 A neutral Afghanistan is in sight. Since the Soviet Union began peace talks with the rebel leadership, the Afghan regime seems no longer even to be interfering in its own international affairs. 8 India is moving into a pivotal role in efforts to find a solution to the war in Cambodia, as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi prepares for a trip to China on Dec. 19, diplomats and officials said. 5 A Japanese scandal enmeshed the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation more deeply and caused the demotion a senior executive. The action came within hours of the resignation of Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 36 Downed pilot knew of peril 3 Walesa and Sakharov arrive in Paris 3 National 9-12, 32, 50 The troubled Savannah River reactor will be ready to restart production of nuclear weapon fuel in a few months, a top Energy Department official said. But other safety officials believe it will not be ready for a year. 10 News analysis: Under the tax debate in Washington lies a fundamental change in the way Federal taxes are looked at. They are now seen as a tool to build an efficient economy rather than as a means to redistribute income. 35 A deficit-reduction group was barred by a Federal judge from meeting behind closed doors to hear economic testimony. The bipartisan group, the National Economic Commission, promptly canceled a meeting. 11 Ashland Oil has charged Iranians at the top governmental level with being involved in a conspiracy to use stolen internal Ashland documents in a $500 million lawsuit that Iran filed against Ashland in 1985, according to court records that were unsealed. 35 In a study of environmental damage at the United States Department of Energy's plants for making bomb materials, a picture emerges of years of expediency and carelessness, scattering radioactive waste. 10 Doctors examined President Reagan and found him to be ''in excellent health,'' in his final physical examination as President. 9 Prosecutors in the Iran-contra case intend to show that Oliver North misled the White House and C.I.A. by concealing his use of arms sales profits to buy weapons for Nicaragua rebels, according to documents filed. 11 President-elect Bush tried to placate conservatives by meeting with a delegation of them amid grumbling on the right that they were being deprived of a meaningful role in the next administration. 11 Troubles at commuter airlines and ''what appear to be systemic deficiencies'' in management of the airlines have been reported after a nine-month inspection, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 12 Boosters used to launch the shuttle Discovery in September had hot exhaust gases seeping through caulked seals in its nozzles, but the leakage was not a surprise and posed no threat to the astronauts, officials said. 50 Ann Richards, the Texas treasurer who gained fame by saying George Bush was ''born with a silver foot in his mouth,'' is considering a run for the governorship. 9 Law protecting poor tenants is upheld 32 Bacteria-to-human gene transplant proposal gains 32 Regional 29-32 Black New Yorkers are in a 'crisis,' a city study said, adding that their economic vitality has been sapped by prejudice, problems in getting job training and business loans, and a flood of black school dropouts. 1 A string of shootings on Long Island have created a discernible pattern in time and distance: one on each of the last four nights, all within a mile of one another; but not in logic. The police are groping for a motive, a suspect and an explanation. 1 A plan to cut the state budget gap in New York was proposed by Governor Cuomo. The plan would fill half the gap he has identified and relies heavily on using reserve funds. 29 A new settlement on Shoreham that could end the long controversy over the nuclear power plant is in the process of being sought by Governor Cuomo and Suffolk County officials, they said. 29 Plans to ease Lincoln Tunnel traffic in New Jersey and build a new route to the Hudson River waterfront have been delayed long enough to prompt developers to build their own roads and propose blasting a $50 million tunnel through the Palisades. 29 Insanity defense for Joel Steinberg will be invoked, based on the claim that Mr. Steinberg was ''delusional'' on Nov. 1, 1987, as soon as the prosecution completes its murder case, Mr. Steinberg's lawyer said. 31 Darien students protest curriculum changes 30 Financial swindler gets 8-year term 31 Fire I. deer hunt starts next Saturday 31 Neediest Cases 32",1988-12-10T05:00:00+0000

Scotch pines are most popular, followed by Douglas firs, balsams and white pines. Prices generally range from $3 to $5.25 a foot, depending on where the tree is purchased. How to Choose: At the tree stand or florist's, test the tree for freshness. Take a branch between thumb and forefinger about six inches from the tip and pull your fingers down the branch toward the tip. If the tree is fresh, it will be green and fragrant and the needles will not fall off in your hand. Keeping It Fresh: Measure up a quarter-inch from the bottom of the trunk and saw it off to allow the tree to absorb water. If you are not going to decorate right away, store the tree outdoors in a bucket of water or a stand that holds several quarts of water, away from sun and wind. After storage, cut off another quarter-inch of the trunk. Safety Tips: Never decorate with lighted candles. Make sure that the lights you use do not give off much heat. Never place the tree near heat sources like radiators or television sets. And unplug the lights before you leave the house or go to bed.

It was the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner, working through the December 1938 holidays with her nephew Otto Frisch, who first realized that Hahn and Strassmann's uranium nuclei had split, or fissioned, to produce barium. The discovery of nuclear fission involved related efforts by a number of scientists. But if there was a single instant when fission was actually discovered, it was when Lise Meitner, on a walk with her nephew in the Swedish countryside, sketched a picture of a uranium nucleus splitting into two parts.

us,ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS: VISIONS UNDER THE TREE,"ISSEY MIYAKE. Photographs by Irving Penn. Edited by Nicholas Callaway. (New York Graphic Society, $40 until Dec. 31; $50 thereafter.) Issey Miyake makes clothes that free body and spirit. Just a shadow of womanly shape is revealed inside an airy cocoon of fabric. An origami of pale pleats enfolds the figure, not as its designer dictates, but as the wearer chooses. Mr. Miyake, born in Hiroshima, came to Paris from Japan in 1968, the year of student revolt. He became - although he would deny it - the head of a warrior army of designers who were to challenge Western conventions of sexuality, of femininity, of what was appropriate in dress. Now, 20 years later, Irving Penn celebrates Mr. Miyake, in photographs that have the sculptural quality of the clothes themselves. These can be odd: breasts swelling out of a silicone bustier above inflated polyurethane pants. Or they can be classic: a ploughed furrow of pleats as a shirttail to a black dinner suit. The textures of this most tactile of designers - his gauzy open-weave linen scarf or unfinished bamboo hat like nesting chopsticks - come over with striking clarity. Fabric is the medium of Issey Miyake's fashion message. Mr. Penn portrays the felted fronds of acid-treated wool and the luminous transparence of a coat in chemically treated paper. ''There are no boundaries for what can be fabric,'' says the designer in one of the succint comments that go with each picture. Mr. Miyake's roots are in the natural world. A dress of glistening, pleated waves is inspired by seaweed; a coat knitted in ribbed stripes of shell pink, sand and sky blue is worked with fishing-line thread to create its rounded conch shape. The outfits are photographed on Japanese women and yet they have a universal quality. ''My generation in Japan lived in limbo,'' says Issey Miyake. ''We dreamed between two worlds.''",1988-12-11T05:00:00+0000

A flurry of activity in Texaco stock last week prompted speculation that Mr. Icahn had found a partner who was attempting to help him accumulate 25 percent of the shares.

us,New & Noteworthy,"GIG, by James D. Houston. (Creative Arts Book Company, $8.95.) For Roy Ambrose, a middle-aged jazz musician, one gig seems pretty much like the next. But on Saturdays - especially with a full moon in the sky - he knows that the evening is bound to be wild. This novel about a night at a California roadhouse is a ''sparkling tour de force'' and ''continually intriguing,'' Martin Levin said in The Book Review in 1969. HITCHCOCK AND SELZNICK: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in Hollywood, by Leonard J. Leff. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $11.95.) In a battle of enormous egos, the producer David O. Selznick and the director Alfred Hitchcock collaborated on ''Rebecca,'' ''Spellbound,'' ''Notorious'' and, finally, ''The Paradine Case.'' The last film was a disaster and the stormy partnership ended, but Hitchcock came away from the experience a more mature artist, Leonard J. Leff believes. Earlier this year our reviewer, Stephen Harvey, said this book is ''an absorbing dual portrait of professional equals whose clash of wills brought out the best in each of them even if the cost, in the end, proved more than either was willing to pay.'' CAFE NEVO, by Barbara Rogan. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) During the war in Lebanon, a Tel Aviv bistro becomes a meeting place where an odd collection of writers and artists try to sort out their entangled lives. Last year our reviewer, Robin Finn, said the most interesting character is the proprietor, Emmanuel Sternholz, an old man whose wife and child died in the Holocaust and who ''realizes that thanks to the Mecca that is his cafe, life has its core after all.'' BROADWAY BABIES: The People Who Made the American Musical, by Ethan Mordden. (Oxford University, $7.95.) This history of the American musical is a bit too breezy, Julius Novick said here in 1984, but it ''provides many acute, defining observations. . . . A keen, hyper-nervous mind can be seen in operation throughout.'' WHITE PALACE, by Glenn Savan. (Bantam, $4.50.) A young, up-and-coming advertising man has an affair with a middle-aged waitress. ''Mr. Savan writes skillfully about sex, as he does about most subjects,'' Meg Wolitzer said here last year. ''The author is convincing in creating the opposing worlds of Max and Nora - one ordered and sane, the other frenzied and anarchic.'' CAESARS OF THE WILDERNESS. Company of Adventurers: Volume II, by Peter C. Newman. (Penguin, $8.95.) At the peak of its power, the Hudson's Bay Company controlled an area 10 times the size of the Holy Roman Empire. The second volume of this history of the North American fur monopoly is ''a lively record of several generations of white men who did some quite astounding things,'' Joan Barfoot said here last year. REUBEN, by John Edgar Wideman. (Penguin, $7.95.) From his office in an abandoned trailer in the Pittsburgh ghetto called Homewood, Reuben, a black lawyer, tries to make sense of his clients' chaotic lives. Last year one reviewer called the book ''a work full of unfulfilled promises, deceptions, and rage - but one fueled by high-octane dialogue and explosive characterizations.'' HEARTS AND MINDS: A Personal Chronicle of Race in America, by Harry S. Ashmore. (Seven Locks, $14.95.) As editor of The Arkansas Gazette, Harry S. Ashmore won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorials supporting integration in Little Rock. ''The courage, care and candor that marked Mr. Ashmore's opposition to segregation and segregationists are still with him, qualities that make his book a valuable historical analysis of the last half-century of America's struggle with the racial issue,'' Claude Sitton said here in 1982. BABY HOUSTON, by June Arnold. (Texas Monthly, $8.95.) In a posthumously published fictional memoir, the feminist author June Arnold wrote about Baby, a self-centered, somewhat hysterical widow who lived early this century in the upper echelons of Houston society. ''The adoration that evidently prompted this autobiographical novel tends to depreciate the importance of [ its ] flaws,'' Eve Ottenberg Stone said here last year. ''We are in the arena of emotion, of real life, and of all its claims over those of fiction.'' ADAM & EVE AND THE CITY: Selected Nonfiction, by Francine du Plessix Gray. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) Among the essays in this collection, the profiles of the monk-philosopher Thomas Merton and the fashion commissar Coco Chanel are timeless, Jonathan Alter said here last year. While he complained that some of the author's comments on American mainstream culture were haughty and disdainful, he praised ''her extraordinarily graceful writing style and exquisite literary and cultural sensibilities.'' THE SOURCE OF LIGHT, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A young poet is called back to North Carolina from a self-imposed European exile when his father dies. In 1981, Joyce Carol Oates called Reynolds Price's 10th book ''a somber, rather beautifully muted work,'' with ''a hero who is, in his very uncertainty, absolutely convincing.'' GOVERNING THE HEARTH: Law and the Family in Nineteenth-Century America, by Michael Grossberg. (University of North Carolina, $12.95.) By tracing the 19th-century roots of legal policies on marriage, adoption, abortion and other subjects, Michael Grossberg shows how legal history has helped shape the American family. In 1986 our reviewer, Isabel Marcus, called this ''an interesting and informative volume.''",1988-12-11T05:00:00+0000

In the clubs and pubs, so does the lager and the champagne -even more so now that Britain's once strict licensing laws have been relaxed. True, down by the Embankment of the river Thames, beggars work the commuting crowds and homeless young people sleep under the bridges, huddled in cardboard packaging. But downriver a sparkling new skyline shines - the post-modern high-rise towers of the thriving City of London, the banking and business quarter. The famous Square Mile - England's Wall Street - is an area of glass fantasy these days, and every building has its tree-filled atrium and its crystal elevators. Spreading out over the poorlands of the East End and onto the old docklands, once the heart of British imperial sea trade, it is the core of a new empire, now based on invisible transactions, electronic impulses, video display unit screens, fax machines and, above everything else, the new enterprise spirit.",1988-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,What They're Wearing,"She seemed all but smothered in her petal-layered Ungaro, but Anne Bass wasn't letting a few excess yards of fabric cramp her style. Nor were lots of other women seen this past year on the dance floor at gala parties all over town. Not one was tripped up by a swirling skirt, sweeping train or triple-tiered ball gown. Proving, as Kenneth Jay Lane notes, that ''the dress does not the dancer make.'' The jewelry designer, who has partnered his share of fashionable women, admits that ''I've seen skirts you can't get close to.'' But things change, and already yesterday's pouf skirt and other wide-bodied looks have begun to be overtaken by leaner styles. Still, not everyone is giving up on fullness. Carolyne Roehm, for one, the designer and socialite, likes the romance of a wide skirt. ''It makes me feel feminine,'' she says. Downtown, where voguing is the rage (the dance is a series of stylized movements that recall 1960's fashion photographs), club personalities like Nell Campbell equate femininity with sultriness. ''I like dancing in high heels and a tight frock,'' says Ms. Campbell. ''But the dress has to move. If it doesn't give, how can I?''",1988-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,GLOBAL BRIEFS,"* The Soviet Union has proposed financial regulations intended to let businesses deal directly with foreign partners, make the ruble exchange rate more realistic and lower barriers to starting joint ventures. The rules, stated in a resolution adopted last week by the Council of Ministers, call for state enterprises and the Soviet cooperative movement to make direct foreign transactions by April. Several thousand cooperatives, ranging from those making household goods to restaurants, sprang up after laws supporting them were passed this year. Such transactions will be carried out on the basis of ''authentic foreign currency self-repayment,'' and Moscow will not be responsible for the groups' debts, the text said. The regulations will progressively end Moscow's current fixing of the ruble. As of Jan. 1, 1990, the ruble will initially be fixed at half its present value against convertible currencies for export-import transactions. A new exchange rate is to be set a year later. As for joint ventures, the document proposed to end Moscow's insistence on retaining a 51 percent interest but gave no effective dates.",1988-12-12T05:00:00+0000

The Capitals have won 10 and tied 3 of their last 15 games to draw even with the Rangers and Pittsburgh at 34 points. Gartner and Gustafsson both scored their eighth goals in the first period. Steven Leach and Kelly Miller added second-period scores, while Gaetan Duchesne was the only scorer for Quebec. The Nordiques (10-20-2) have lost eight of their last 11 games and are in last place in the Adams Division. Washington (15-12-4) dominated the first period, outshooting the Nordiques by 14-3 and taking a 2-0 edge. Gartner opened the scoring at 11 minutes 44 seconds when he redirected a ararp-angle shot by Scott Stevens, a defenseman. Gartner had an excellent chance four minutes later, however, he was robbed by Mario Gosselin, the Quebec goaltender, from point-blank range. But the puck came back to Gustafsson, who failed on his first try from the side of the net, then managed to score on his own rebound. ''The big thing with us is that we're playing as a team, and we're not giving the other teams too many chances,'' said Bryan Murray, the Capitals' coach. ''That's what it takes to win.'' (AP) Red Wings 5, North Stars 4: Paul MacLean scored his second goal of the game on a power play with 3:06 left in the third period last night to lead Detroit to a home victory. After Bob Brooke and Bob Probert traded goals midway through the third period, Brooke was penalized for roughing Gerard Gallant at 16:28. A fight between the two ensued and Brooke was assessed an additional two-minute penalty. Steve Yzerman fed a pass behind the Minnesota net to Probert, who slid the puck in front, where MacLean jabbed it past Kari Takko, the Minnesota goaltender, for his 17th goal. The Red Wings then killed a penalty to Jim Pavese to ensure their third straight victory. Minnesota trailed, 2-0, before the game was eight minutes old on goals 1:08 apart by MacLean, also on a power play, and Pavese. But the North Stars rallied on Curt Giles's goal midway through the opening period and Basil McRae's seventh of the season 6:59 into the second to tie it. Detroit reclaimed the lead midway through the period on Dave Barr's 11th goal. The game drew 19,709 fans, marking the 80th straight time the Red Wings have drawn more than 19,000.(AP)",1988-12-14T05:00:00+0000

The United Nations strips South Africa of its trusteeship rights. 1968The United Nations renames the territory Namibia. 1971The International Court of Justice rules that the South African presence is illegal. 1973The United Nations General Assembly calls the South-West Africa People's Organization the ''sole authentic representative of the Namibian people.'' 1974United Nations resolutions demand a South African withdrawal and the transfer of power to the Namibian people, with United Nations assistance. 1975Angola becomes independent from Portugal. Cuban troops are sent to Angola at the request of the Angolan Government, led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. 1978The United Nations Security Council approves Resolution 435, which calls for a cease-fire in the Namibian war, United Nations-sponsored elections and a peacekeeping force in Namibia. Pretoria holds elections in Namibia, but they are boycotted by the South-West Africa People's Organization; the elections are not recognized internationally. 1982Pretoria says that for Namibia to gain freedom, Cuban troops must leave Angola. 1983In December, South Africa launches a major operation against Namibian guerrillas in Angola. Pretoria offers a 30-day cease-fire; it is rejected. 1984In January, South Africa says it will pull troops from from southern Angola.

The settlement avoided a trial that had threatened to drag into a courtroom some of baseball's most familiar names. In April 1986, after Parker had testified at the drug trial of one of his cocaine suppliers that his use of that drug contributed to his playing slump early in the 1980's, the Pirates filed a Federal court lawsuit against him, seeking to void the contract signed in 1979 under which the Pirates were obligated to make deferred payments of approximately $5.3 million. The lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial in United States District Court in Pittsburgh on Feb. 6, 1989. Rick Cerrone, a spokesman for the Pirates, said the terms of the out-of-court settlement would be kept confidential by mutual agreement. In the breach-of-contract suit, the Pirates charged that Parker was a heavy cocaine user for nearly five years and that his drug use reduced him to an overweight, injury-prone player ''overpaid for the drug-impaired performances'' under the 1979 contract. Parker's attorneys contended that the Pirates knew about Parker's cocaine use. Parker, as a free agent after the 1983 season, rejected an offer from the Pirates and signed with Cincinnati.(AP)",1988-12-14T05:00:00+0000

The letter, from David Berst, the N.C.A.A.'s assistant executive director, read in part, ''Based on information you submitted, it does not appear that action on the matter is warranted by the N.C.A.A.'' Louisville started its own investigation of Kimbro's senior-year grades after an article appeared in The Courier-Journal Sept. 18. In the article, teachers said they felt pressured to give Kimbro A's or B's and quoted two who said they gave him undeservedly high grades. There were no charges against Kimbro or Louisville. In its report to the N.C.A.A., Louisville said the allegations were not credible and affirmed Kimbro's eligibility. The N.C.A.A. said that when former teachers and administrators at the school were interviewed, they all said they had no knowledge of academic favoritism for Kimbro or improper influence exerted on his grades.(AP)",1988-12-15T05:00:00+0000

But it would be a pity if visitors were to hurry, head down like runaway bison, in those two directions alone. To the left, as you walk into the Diebenkorn galleries, there is a small show drawn from the museum's acquisitions of the past few years. It gives us a sample, here and there, of activities that are fundamental to the museum's mission but that do not always attract much public attention. And to the right of the main entrance at street level, there is the latest in the distinguished and inventive series of small exhibitions by younger or less-well-known artists, directed by Linda Shearer, curator in the museum's department of painting and sculpture, Individual acquisitions by the score come into the museum every year, but with rare exceptions they take their place in the ranks with minimal stir. Where they accrue to the departments of drawings, or of photography, they will most often be seen only from time to time or on special application. If they enter the design collection, considerations of space play their part. A second helicopter, for instance, would not be seen every day.",1988-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only Christmas hours are given.< Darbar ** (Sept. 5, 1986), 44 West 56th Street (432-7227) - When the calendar reads Dec. 25 and cooking a Christmas goose is not on your agenda, here are some restaurants open on Christmas Day. Darbar is a consistently rewarding and moderately priced midtown restaurant. The refined Mogul cuisine of northern India is served in a multilevel room decorated in vivid colors. Appetizers include all the little fritters familiar to fans of Indian food (filled with vegetables, chicken or shrimp), served with tamarind and mint sauces. Recommended entrees are reshmi kebab, spiced chicken roasted on skewers in the tandoor; boti kebab, which is marinated lamb, and gosht vindaloo, a spicy lamb stew. There are also vegetarian dishes and wonderful Indian fried and baked breads. Appetizers are $5.95 to $13.95, entrees $8.75 to $21.95. Open 5:30 to 10 P.M. David K's ** (Jan. 15, 1988), 1115 Third Avenue, at 59th Street (371-9090) - David K's has a contemporary cool look with its glass wall facing Third Avenue, spacious wicker chairs and fine china and silver tableware. The menu is low in fats and oils, and frying is kept to a minimum. Among the recommended appetizers are jumping shrimp cooked in the shell with scallions and garlic Chinese noodles tossed with ginger sauce and lobster pieces, and shredded beef with crisp rice noodles in a mustard-peanut dressing. Good entrees are the Peking chicken served with whole-wheat pancakes and scallions ($28.50, serving two to four diners); braised sea bass; pork with cashews, leeks and hot peppers, and lobster in lemon sauce. Dinner appetizers are $4.50 to $12.50, entrees $13.50 to $18.50. Open 5 to 11 P.M. Omen ** (Oct. 18, 1985), 113 Thompson Street (925-8923) - This charming SoHo restaurant, designed to resemble a Japanese country inn, is named for its signature dish. Lanterns hang from the timbered ceiling, and striking calligraphy graces the walls. Omen is a seaweed-broth-based dish that combines artfully arranged vegetables (radish, lotus root, broccoli, spinach, scallions) with wheat noodles. Very fresh sashimi is available, but not sushi. Some of the menu choices are raw tuna with Japanese yam crowned with a quail egg; avocado and shrimp with miso sauce, and boned, marinated chicken dishes. Prix fixe menu at $23; a la carte $5 to $19. Open 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Rosa Mexicano ** (Aug. 1, 1986), 1063 First Avenue, at 58th Street (753-7407) - For the holiday, Rosa Mexicano's front dining room is strung with papel picado, red and green paper garlands that are traditional Mexican decorations. The more restrained back room has rose stucco walls, mauve banquettes and a stone fountain filled with colorful flowers. Recommended are the pomegranate margaritas and appetizers of freshly prepared guacamole, and tortillas with shredded pork and chilies. Grilled entrees, cooked over stone briquettes, include shell steak with sauteed poblano chilies and piquant grilled chicken. Appetizers are $6.50 to $9, entrees $13 to $20. Open 4 to 10 P.M.

Among the appetizers are pumpkin ravioli with fricassee of mushrooms and a casserole of oysters and lobster in fennel-cream sauce.

Page 1 Four Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank as clashes broke out at a funeral. The death toll was the highest since last April. 6 Syria and Iran were unhappy with the Palestine Liberation Organization's meeting with the United States. Official newspapers in Damascus rejected the talks, and one said Middle East peace ''should be taken by force.'' 6 The structural defects in Armenia that contributed to the recent earthquake's devastation are widespread in most countries. But engineers have developed methods for reinforcing buildings that might have saved many lives. 1 Soviets will not begin bulldozing cities destroyed by last week's earthquake. They said they would continue to search the wreckage until every body is accounted for and every trapped survivor found. 3 President Reagan accused Congress of exceeding its proper authority and intruding into his prerogatives as chief diplomat and military commander. 7 China's position on Cambodia regarding a diplomatic settlement is coming closer to that of Hun Sen, the Prime Minister of the Vietnamese-backed Government said at a news conference. 28 A British Cabinet minister resigned after causing a storm by asserting two weeks ago that most British eggs were infected with dangerous salmonella bacteria. 5 A Swiss official was freed in Lebanon a month after he was seized in the southern port of Sidon by unidentified gunmen. Meanwhile, other gunmen in southern Lebanon kidnapped three Irish peacekeeping soldiers. 7 The suspected killer of Olof Palme was ordered held for two weeks to give prosecutors time to assemble their case and charge the suspect. The move appears to be the furthest advance in the hunt for the assassin. 3 National 8-12, 32 George Bush named John G. Tower, a former Texas Senator with strong ties to the defense industry, as Defense Secretary, saying that he was ''totally satisfied'' with the F.B.I.'s check into the candidate's background. 1 Man in the news: John G. Tower, President-elect Bush's nominee for Secretary of Defense, provoked questions that have dogged the former Texas Senator since he was first mentioned as a candidate for the job. 1 Three Governors demanded expensive environmental cleanups as their price for allowing a nuclear weapons plant to stay open. Their demands came at a meeting in Salt Lake City with the Department of Energy. 1 In a reassuring report on inflation, the Labor Department said prices received by American producers for finished goods rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the same as the average for the three preceding months. 1 The role of an informer, in this case the former teamster president, Jackie Presser, is at the heart of the racketeering and embezzlement case against two of Mr. Presser's former associates. 32 Chicago raids aimed at gangs and other criminal elements in Chicago housing projects have violated the civil rights of tenants, the American Civil Liberties Union alleged. 8 Unofficial diplomacy in Texas is becoming ever more common between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, cities that in many ways function as one, their houses 50 feet apart although they lie on opposite sides of a border. 8 An 18-year-old murderer in Dallas was given a more lenient sentence because the homosexual men he shot to death were ''cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,'' the judge said. 8 The savings and loan situation has created tension within the Government on how to address the crisis through the budgetary process. The consensus is that taxpayer funds will be required. 35 Mother whose newborn was drug addict faces felony charge 9 Prosecutor selected to try North 11 Air Force raises estimate of Stealth bomber cost 12 Regional 29-32 News analysis: Homeless people are whose responsibility? Every interest group and every layer of government points a finger at someone else for both the general problem and the specific conditions of shelters. 1 A new residence for the homeless on the Lower East Side, the Cube, is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation and a dream come true for families who have spent years living in abandoned buildings or welfare hotels. 29 Grumman Corp. will cut 2,500 jobs on Long Island by the end of 1989, laying off 1,800 workers and eliminating 700 other positions through attrition, the company announced. 1 The state budget gap increased slightly when the Legislature returned to Albany, ostensibly to shrink it. Lawmakers approved 5 percent pay raises for 15,000 management level state bureaucrats. 29 Teachers have written to Santa requesting classroom supplies that the school system's $5.7 billion budget does not provide. The letters are on display at the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. 29 Plans for Trump Centre in Paramus, a 40-acre mall-hotel-office complex of bronze and marble, ponds and parks, has set off an uproar among residents. 29 As a badly beaten boy recovered, authorities said they were trying to determine whether they had missed any early warning signs that could have saved the life of his 5-year-old half sister. 31 In the Joel Steinberg trial, the defense lawyer, Ira D. London, said he would not enter a formal insanity defense on the ground that it would allow the prosecution to use it ''to poison the jury's mind about Joel.'' 31 In their closing statements, lawyers in the Bess Myserson trial vied for the sympathies of the jurors who will decide whether the career that began with the glitter of the Miss America crown will end in disgrace. 31 Talks are set in Lilco case 30 Neediest Cases 33",1988-12-17T05:00:00+0000

When the party is over there may be leftovers, and it is important to know how to wrap these foods and how long they will keep safely. The shelf life of pate, for example, is determined by how fresh it was when it was bought and whether it contains preservatives. Although the turnover in most shops at this time of year is rapid, if there is any doubt about when the pate was made, keep it only a short time. The same goes for caviar, which should not be kept for more than two to three weeks, unopened, after purchase. Here is a guide to food storage. FOOD HOW TO REFRIGERATE Smoked salmon or other smoked fish In plastic wrap. Will keep 5 to 6 days. If frozen, it will keep for two months. Caviar In original tin with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the caviar. Will keep 3 to 4 days; best if used in 24 hours. Pate In double thickness of plastic wrap. Will keep 3 to 10 days, depending on freshness. Freezing may change flavor. Cheese In double thickness of foil. Wrap hard cheese in damp cheesecloth, then foil.

us,FICTION,"CHEKAGO. By Natalya Lowndes. (Dutton, $19.95.) ''Chekago,'' according to the pseudonymous author of this first novel, was a nickname for Moscow in the early 1980's - a play on gangster-era Chicago and the Russian Cheka, the original secret police agency that is now the K. G. B. The author's identity must be withheld because, her publisher says, she is an English university professor who often visits the Soviet Union and must protect her friends. That's a lot of secret stuff to take in before turning the first page of this grim and violent novel of contemporary Moscow life. But there are sporadic rewards for those who keep turning. Some of the characters are almost worthy of Gorky: particularly Sasha, a love-starved garbage collector who stumbles into a conspiracy involving the nasty politics at Feministka, a Soviet women's magazine. The novel's plot is also promising: Sasha, to improve his sexual knowledge and technique, steals a batch of letters written by some lovelorn readers to the magazine. He has an affair with an American woman, Bobby, who loves all things Russian but frightens him off when she tells him what she wants in bed. There are some vivid details that put the reader right in the smelly communal kitchen where much of ''Chekago'' takes place, not to mention some sly social shorthand, as when a character flicks his neck with a finger, the traditional silent way for Russians to indicate it's time to bring out the strong liquor. There is even some wry humor. (''Sex with Bobby,'' Sasha tells himself, ''was as hard and protracted and as faintly envisigeable as Communism: always preceded by some lengthy and disagreeable stage where you were to earn your bright promise of tomorrow.'') But other characters crash into Sasha's world, including a vulgar, swindling policeman called Legless, as well as other crooks and perverts. The humor fades; the going gets very gory. The point of it all seems to be - in case we didn't know - that there are some sad and nasty people in Moscow too.",1988-12-18T05:00:00+0000

Before that, he sold from three other locations in Stamford. ''It's amazing, but a lot of people spend more time deciding on a tree than on a new car,'' Mr. Candido said. ''And there are more arguments among families over which tree to get. Then there are the people who don't trust you and bring their own measuring sticks to make sure that a seven-footer is actually seven-feet tall.'' Mr. Candido, who is known by most as Lefty, is part of a vanishing breed in Fairfield County - the independent Christmas tree lot operator who spends about 12 hours a day, seven days a week over a three- or four-week period selling Christmas trees. Years ago, during the Yuletide season, Christmas trees were sold on corner lots in virtually every neighborhood.

Anyone unfamiliar with how we use taxes and social programs to redistribute wealth will find a useful primer in ''Starting Even.'' It looks at the have-nots among us and explains, in too much detail, Government efforts to reduce inequality. Robert Haveman, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, would replace many income transfer programs, like welfare and food stamps, with a minimum benefit level, or ''demogrant,'' through a refundable tax credit. He would also establish a child-support system for children in families with single mothers, employment subsidies for disadvantaged workers (including a tax credit for creation of jobs for low-skilled workers) and a personal grant of $20,000 to all 18-year-olds for education and health care. But he offers insufficient analysis of how these interesting proposals would truly help the new poor that society has failed the most: youths (particularly minority youths, too unskilled and alienated to compete in the job market), single mothers and their children. Mr. Haveman wants to equalize opportunity by encouraging independence and self-reliance. But for the population he is most concerned about, social services like prenatal care and early childhood education are, arguably, as important as subsidies to combat poverty. Does it make sense to give an 18-year-old a $20,000 grant for college after 12 years of an inadequate education? By concentrating more on subsidies than services, Mr. Haveman's proposals do not seem to go far enough to achieve his goals.",1988-12-18T05:00:00+0000

The Secretary of Education, Lauro F. Cavazos, who was appointed this year by President Reagan and has been asked by Mr. Bush to stay on, talked recently about the ''three major deficits in this country: budget deficits, trade deficits and an educational deficit.''

And it is not that I begrudge him the sense of accomplishment (when, in fact, I am in awe of all one must master); nor do I pooh-pooh the sense of tranquillity he experiences above the clouds (when, in fact, I envy that feeling); nor do I dismiss the ease and speed with which we have closed the expanse between New Jersey and Massachusetts where our families live (when, in fact, I appreciate getting to visit my ailing dad and cheering up my mother).

us,IMAGES OF IMPROVISATION,"The Japanese photographer and fan K. Abe has compiled probably the best and most satisfying book of jazz photographs ever published. Aside from the briefest of introductions by Nat Hentoff and Mr. Abe, there is no text in JAZZ GIANTS: A Visual Retrospective (Billboard, $60). Each photo is accompanied only by a small identifying caption. Certain figures, such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, appear throughout and provide continuity. But for the most part the pictures have been arranged in an improvisatory, free-associative manner, and witty, revealing contrasts and harmonies are set up every time a page is turned. Solemn, formal portraits of the short-lived trumpeters Bunny Berigan and Bix Beiderbecke face each other; turn the page and Berigan is clowning for the camera across from a picture of the equally short-lived pianist Fats Waller dancing with a helplessly giggling young woman. Elsewhere, the pianist Red Garland - tense, poised - faces a pensive, shadowed portrait of his contemporary Bobby Timmons, and the impassive Ellington saxophonist Johnny Hodges plays in profile, across from a jubilant study of Duke himself. The photographs are extremely well-reproduced, mostly in black and white, and are printed on luscious, high-quality stock. Three color sections are slightly less successful, but a two-page nighttime color photo of a neon-lit 52d Street in the rain during its heyday in the 1940's is the stuff of which dreams are made.

Born with a quick mind, an uncanny ability to memorize and mimic and a facile readiness to adjust to any situation, Shirley Temple became the biggest child star of all time. She was blessed with a sturdy self-confidence that allowed her to give unsolicited advice on how to handle the press even to Eleanor Roosevelt. She survived an assassination attempt by a woman who believed that the child star had stolen her daughter's soul, as well as multiple threats of kidnapping. Mrs. Black mentions these incidents in ''Child Star,'' an account of her first 26 years, with no more or less emphasis than she tells of the onset of her first menstruation or the loss of her front teeth. The beautiful child with dimples and corkscrew curls is as cute in this book as she was on the screen and as unreal as her celluloid characters. Where is Mrs. Black's outrage at the ''black box,'' a torture tool used by the studio for obstreperous child stars, which consisted of a soundproofed, unventilated container fitted with a large block of ice that provided a wet floor on which to stand or a freezing stool on which to sit?

Mr. Blachowicz writes of ''the systematic displacement of Armenians by Turks''; displacement is hardly the accurate term. The Turkish genocide against the Armenians involved torture and mass killings of men, women and children whose only crime was that they were Armenians. To refer to this tragedy as a displacement is a kind of Orwellian doublespeak. HAIG BOSMAJIAN Seattle James Blachowicz replies: I appreciate the concern of Mr. Bosmajian. The term ''systematic displacement'' is an unfortunate euphemism. I did not discuss in detail this event nor did I examine any of the historical or political relations among Turks, Russians, Armenians, Kurds, Greeks and others, not only because such issues were not the focus of the article but also because more space would have been required to do them justice. I believe readers of The New York Times are generally aware of the tragedies visited on the Armenian people, especially in the events of 1915.

Many resorts, particularly in Austria and Switzerland (but not in France), have been especially cautious about raising rates. The increases used to reach 10 percent and more, at least for hotels. Lech, one of Austria's leading ski areas, proudly points out that in the last three years, price increases have remained under 3 percent, and Arosa, Switzerland, reports a rise of only one percent in hotel rates this season over last. (Lift ticket prices were raised 5 1/2 percent but it was the first increase in three years.) Some resorts have raised rates on both lifts and hotels this winter by up to 5 percent. However, rates for lifts and hotels in most leading Alpine resorts continue to undercut those of major ski resorts in the United States.

Most developing countries are no better off than when the global debt crisis erupted in 1982, although the threat to the international banking system has abated, the bank said. The bank warned that the drain of money from impoverished countries ''of the speed and magnitude recorded in recent years represents a new and significant constraint on their expansion.'' [ Page A1. ] Czechoslovak farmers have made a blossoming business venture out of a thriving agricultural cooperative. In the process they have routinely defied party orthodoxy while vaulting into the front ranks of the nation's, and the East bloc's, producers of computers, machinery and biotechnology. [ D1. ] Ghana is working to recapture its pre-independence glory as Africa's Gold Coast. American, Australian, British and Canadian companies have responded to incentives it has offered. [ D4. ] COMPANIES Pillsbury agreed to be acquired by Grand Metropolitan for $66 a share in cash, or $5.68 billion, ending a two-month struggle. On Friday, a Delaware judge struck down Pillsbury's ''poison pill'' defense plan, immediately prompting it to begin negotiating. [ A1. ] American Savings and Loan will have a new chief executive after its acquisition by the Bass Group is completed. [ D1. ] Brunswick said it expected a 50 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings and a 10 percent drop in sales. [ D3. ] Campeau reported a lower net loss for the nine months ended Oct. 31. The company lost $14 million in the period, compared with a loss of $123 million a year earlier. [ D3. ] THE ECONOMY A further increase in the prime lending rate is likely before the end of the year, even if the Fed continues to put off an increase in its discount rate, analysts said. Historically, the next two weeks are usually the slowest of the year for the credit markets. [ D1. ] Holiday business has stepped up sharply from the sluggish pace of the middle two weeks in the four-week season, reports from several cities show. To encourage shoppers, more stores have cut prices and followed the lead of Sears, Roebuck by increasing customers' credit lines and extending repayment periods. [ D1. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS The British entrepreneur Eddie Shah is quitting newspapers. Mr. Shah, who helped revolutionize the British newspaper industry, shut down his five-week-old tabloid, The Post, after just 33 issues and losses estimated at more than $12 million.

The Cavaliers, who lead the league in defense and are 14-1 when they hold an opponent under 100 points, forced 10 turnovers in the third quarter, leading to 14 points.(AP) Pistons 116, Heat 100: Adrian Dantley scored 9 of his 19 points in the first quarter as Detroit broke to a early lead at The Palace. A 3-pointer by Bill Laimbeer started a 22-10 run that gave the Pistons a 31-19 lead at the end of the first quarter. Detroit led 61-45 at halftime and 87-72 going into the final period.(AP) Mavericks 108, 76ers 102: Rolando Blackman scored 20 of his 24 points in the second half to give Dallas its fifth consecutive road game, equaling a club record. Sam Perkins had 25 points and Mark Aguirre 21 for the Mavericks, who are 6-1 on the road, the best in the league. Dallas led by 102-95 on a jumper by Derek Harper with 2:48 to play.

With Sacramento leading by 97-96, Olajuwon was called for goaltending on a shot by Harold Pressley. Olajuwon disputed the call by Ed Rush and was ejected from the game after Rush called two technical fouls on him. Pressley hit both technical foul shots, and a free throw by Pinckney gave Sacramento a 102-96 lead with 1:54 left. Mike Woodson's 3-point shot cut the Kings lead to 102-99.

The Suns won their seventh straight home game and dealt San Antonio its eighth consecutive loss.(AP) Bucks 125, Hornets 115: Terry Cummings scored a season-high 37 points and Ricky Pierce had 17 fourth-quarter points for Milwaukee.(AP) N.H.L. Red Wings 6, Blues 3: Steve Yzerman scored his 32d goal midway through the final period to snap a 3-3 tie. Yzerman, who also had three assists, ran his point-scoring string to 22 games, tying the team record he set last season. After Paul MacLean's power-play goal tied the score 3-3 7:56 into the final period, Yzerman took a long pass from Joe Murphy, eluded two defenders and drove a wrist shot past the goaltender Greg Millen. Gallant scored his second power-play goal of the game with 1:45 left and Miroslav Frycer connected 53 seconds later.(AP) SKIING Tight Finish: Vreni Schneider of Switzerland edged Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain by one-hundredth of a second to win a women's World Cup slalom yesterday in Courmayeur, Italy.

us,Dining Out Guide: Cassoulet,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Ambassador Grill * (Oct. 3, 1986), 1 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue at 44th Street (355-3400) - Now that winter is here, robust fare is appropriate, and one of the most satisfying meals is cassoulet, the white-bean dish of southwest France that includes confit, pork or lamb and sausages. Half the menu of the Ambassador Grill is devoted to the foods of Gascony, the glorious region of ducks, geese, foie gras, confit, truffles - and cassoulet. The grill's version with duck meat may be less rich and complex than it could be, but it is flavorful nonetheless. An appealing starter, if you feel you have the room before the cassoulet, is the apple stuffed with fresh foie gras and served with a Sauternes sauce. For dessert, try crepes filled with chestnut cream, a fitting finale. Dinner prix fixe is $27, surely one of the better bargains in town. Open 7 to 11 A.M., noon to 2 P.M. and 6 to 10:30 P.M. on Friday; 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 10:30 P.M. on Saturday, and 7:30 to 10:30 A.M., 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 10:30 P.M. on Sunday. La Colombe d'Or *** (Sept. 16, 1988), 134 East 26th Street (689-0666) - A snug Provencal-style French establishment, this restaurant has a terra-cotta floor, colorful banquettes, whitewashed brick walls and gentle lighting. There is an impressive range of dishes that evoke the sunny and fragrant cuisine of southern France. The duck confit served here is outstanding: moist, full of flavor and crisply sauteed. It is among the ingredients in the cassoulet, which also includes beans, of course, along with confit of pork and two types of sausage. A good starter is escargots; a pleasing conclusion, ginger-spiked custard. Entrees are $16 to $25. Open noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M. Friday and 6 to 11 P.M. Saturday. Closed Sunday. La Cote Basque *** (Aug. 22, 1986), 5 East 55th Street (688-6525) - The restaurant's dining room, after 30 years, still exudes a timeless glamour with its murals of coastal France, red leather banquettes, splendid flower clusters and a well-turned-out crowd. Habitues of this fortress of classic French cuisine look for comfort, cosseting and food they can really get their teeth into. The last includes a hearty cassoulet with roast pork, sausage, lamb stew and sauteed duck (fatback and garlic make the dish especially lusty). Light appetizers are available, like sparkling cold salads and vegetable combinations. For dessert, there is a silky, concentrated chocolate mousse. Dinner prix fixe at $52. Open noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 10:30 P.M. Friday and 6 to 11 P.M. Saturday. Closed Sunday. Quatorze ** (Feb. 26, 1988), 240 West 14th Street (206-7006) - This is the sort of place you go to for sustenance, not surprises. Its modest setting is as guileless as the food; it has a long, pale-yellow-toned room with maroon wood trim, Art Deco sconces, French posters and neighborly banquettes. The cassoulet here has the requisite white beans, along with homemade pork and duck confits, lamb sausage and garlic sausage, all enlivened with a bit of tomato, fresh thyme and dried herbes de Provence. As a complimentary appetizer, there is a mildly livery terrine with green peppercorns. The dessert of choice is a thin, buttery apple tart the size of a Volkswagen hubcap. Entrees are $15.50 to $22.50. Open noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11:30 P.M. Friday, 6 to 11:30 P.M. Saturday and 5:30 to 11 P.M. Sunday.",1988-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Most brands contain inhibitors for corrosion and rust. Antifreeze must always be mixed with water, although some brands come premixed. All brands should be able to prevent an engine from freezing in temperatures of 34 degrees below zero. Each brand has a different concentration of ethylene glycol. Avoid any brand with more than 50 percent water, which is too watered-down.

Page 1 Airlines have no assured protection against bombs, experts in aviation security said, noting that officials had been paying particular attention to the possibility of bomb attacks in recent months. 5 A plane flaw should not be dismissed yet as a possible cause of the midair disintegration of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Scotland, several aviation officials indicated. 5 A Brazilian union leader was killed Thursday night at his home in northwestern Brazil. He had received repeated death threats during a campaign to protect the Amazon rain forest. 1 The Pope received Yasir Arafat and told him that Israelis and Palestinians had ''an identical fundamental right to their own homelands,'' but that both must reject violence, including terrorism and reprisals. 3 New analysis: The P.L.O. has achieved a long-standing goal in starting a dialogue with Washington, but a long-standing challenge remains: to show that Palestinian aspirations will not prove perilous to Israel. 3 Lebanese Shiite Muslim militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas agreed to end three years of fighting in southern Lebanon. 2 South Africa has agreed to cut back the number of policemen in Namibia and to disband a police force in an attempt to show the United Nations that free elections there will not be subverted, diplomats said. 4 Holiday shoppers in Warsaw can buy from a great variety of luxury goods at a department store, and they can do so with any of 23 world currenices. The catch: The Polish zloty is not one of those currencies. 4 National 6-8, 28, 46 Hidden losses in Government loans to groups like farmers, students and small businesses have reached startlingly high levels and the losses will cost taxpayers billions of dollars for years to come, budget experts say. 1 The Pentagon retracted a statement that eight companies in the arms industry face possible criminal prosecution for possession of secret Goverment documents. Only four are being investigated, it said. 1 A new problem for prison systems has evolved as they handle more and more prisoners sentenced to longer and longer terms. The problem, complicated and costly, is elderly convicts. 1 Tobacco companies are fighting laws that restrict smoking in public with a richly financed campaign in areas as large as California and as small as Midwestern towns. 1 A Dutch man arrested in Miami on charges of exporting computers to the Soviet bloc has led one of the largest high-technology smuggling operations known to Government officials, investigators said. 6 The protest of anti-abortion groups over a move by President-elect Bush - the naming of Dr. Louis W. Sullivan to be Secretary of Health and Human Services - seemed almost inevitable given the movement's satisfaction with President Reagan. 8 Concern about the space shuttle's continued safety was voiced by the chairman of a scientific advisory set up by the National Research Council to monitor the redesign of the space shuttle's booster rockets. 6 The director of the Kinsey Institute was asked by Indiana University to resign from the prominent sex research center. The university cited concern about the quality of recent research and of managment. 7 Retroactive pension benefits for many people who worked past normal retirement age will be ordered by the Internal Revenue Service in cases where employers stopped contributing to their pensions when they reached normal retirement age. 8 Pregnant women with diabetes can reduce the risk of miscarriage by keeping the body's blood sugar level under control, said a study that found that their risk of miscarriage increases with blood sugar levels. 8 American Brands's stock ran up on speculation that a takeover bid was likely. The tobacco and consumer products company is perennially rumored as a takeover target. 35 An article upset Bloomingdale's so much when it appeared in The Wall Street Journal that executives met with the managing editor and the reporter.

The move was in response to politicians' complaints about the board's strict legal interpretations. 29 A town in New Jersey is protesting its selection as a site for a hazardous-waste incinerator that is to take an estimated 50,000 tons a year of toxic waste from across the state. 29 A mother killed her husband and two young children in Rockland County and then apparently tried to commit suicide, hours after her first visit to a psychiatrist, the police said. 30 Cockroaches may be on the decline in New York City - or at least officially recorded complaints about them are.

There is a peculiar affection that the highly privileged sometimes feel for the severely deprived. Rarely has this emotion been given such unrestrained vent as in ''Hayat,'' a self-congratulatory account of a tour through famine-stricken Africa in 1985. Mariapia Fanfani, a vice president of the International Red Cross-Red Crescent and the wife of Amintore Fanfani, the former Prime Minister of Italy, raised funds to fill the hold of a ''Ship of Peace'' with relief supplies. For two months, Mrs. Fanfani was escorted by various officials to ports where the ship was unloading and to camps where goods were being distributed. Mrs. Fanfani's writing is as graceful and insightful as a press release from the United Nations. ''I believe that compassion has no geography and that a gesture, however small, is never useless,'' she writes. ''It is always a mark of friendship among people.'' Much of the book is taken up with maudlin and patronizing descriptions of Mrs. Fanfani's encounters with impoverished Africa. ''They were also beautiful, and their wretchedness had not managed to eradicate the signs of a fascination that is still there in the sad smile of the African water bearers before me now,'' she writes. ''They probably have only one change of clothing and will never have any wealth, only fatigue, hunger, and privation.'' Celebrities who raise money for charity deserve praise and maybe even an all-expenses-paid trip to Africa. Publishing their travel diaries is more difficult to justify.",1988-12-25T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"SECOND SIGHT, by Mary Tannen. (Ivy, $3.95.) In the depths of urban New Jersey, a film director and a building developer become mixed up with a psychic named Destiny Ortega. In this first novel, Mary Tannen ''somehow makes it all work,'' Gary Krist said here earlier this year. ''She skillfully creates a fictional world spacious enough to house the highborn and the lowborn, the rational as well as the mystical.'' BY SILENCE BETRAYED: Sexual Abuse of Children in America, by John Crewdson. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) As they study the pictures of missing children on the sides of milk cartons and dutifully warn their offspring against taking candy from strangers, parents are offering themselves false comfort, John Crewdson writes. Most childhood sexual abuse is not rape and abduction by violent interlopers but skillful seduction by the child's own family, neighbors, teachers and other acquaintances. In February, our reviewer, Sherry Turkle, said this book was ''stunning in its statement of the facts and unrelenting in its attacks on our myths. . . . The illness is not just adults' sexual aggression toward children. It is also that we allow abuse to be an unspoken and invisible social fact.'' I LOOK DIVINE, by Christopher Coe. (Vintage, $5.95.) When Nicholas, a pathologically narcissistic homosexual, dies inexplicably at age 37, his older brother tries to figure out what went wrong. Last year, our reviewer, Richard Burgin, called the author of this novel ''an icy and acute observer.'' MY GURU AND HIS DISCIPLE, by Christopher Isherwood. (Noonday/Michael di Capua/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) In 1939, long before the mysteries of the East had become all the rage, the writer Christopher Isherwood began studying under a Hindu swami, tempering his sybaritic Hollywood existence with such worthy pursuits as translating the Bhagavad-Gita. ''What emerges is a record of a religious adventure that would have delighted Kierkegaard,'' Edmund White said here in 1980. ''Isherwood rejects conventional piety - all the humdrum apparatus of worship - in favor of a direct, even jaunty appreciation of how preposterous, certainly precarious, spirituality can be today.'' Noonday Press has also made three additions to its uniform set of Isherwood novels. In A MEETING BY THE RIVER ($7.95), the writer also explores the world's continuing war between spirit and flesh. This time the tension is between two brothers: Patrick, a homosexual publisher, and Oliver, who has decided to become a Hindu monk. The story is told with a ''natural charm that will make almost any literate reader, free of prejudice against its subject matter, want to read it to the end,'' Gerald Sykes said in The Book Review in 1967. THE WORLD IN THE EVENING ($8.95) tells of Stephen Monk, who flees Hollywood for loftier climes after he catches his wife committing adultery at a party. In 1954, our reviewer, Mark Schorer, called the book ''a brilliant enigma.'' First published in 1932 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth Press, THE MEMORIAL: Portrait of a Family ($8.95) uses the story of troubled siblings in London to document the decline of British society after the First World War. THE CARE OF THE SELF: Volume Three of The History of Sexuality, by Michel Foucault. Translated by Robert Hurley. (Vintage, $7.95.) The French archeologist of human consciousness traces the roots of our sexual anxiety to imperial Rome when, it appears, the first Me Generation was born. Through Michel Foucault's eyes, this ancient world is ''almost uncannily familiar,'' John Boswell said here last year. ''Its population . . . is obsessed with personal health and the care of the body. Pop medical authorities cater to this preoccupation by providing guides to diet, exercise, sex and regimen that seem surprisingly modern - down to such fine points as the recommendation to eat a lot of bran.'' Vintage has also published a new edition of MADNESS AND CIVILIZATION: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason ($7.95), which is perhaps Foucault's best-known attempt to show how those in power shape the way we perceive reality. ''This is a difficult but rewarding book, beautifully written and subtle in its development,'' one reviewer said in 1965. THE SCREAMING MIMI, by Fredric Brown. (Carroll & Graf, $3.50.) In this classic pulp thriller, a hard-drinking newsman tracks down a serial murderer called the Ripper. In 1949 one reviewer called the book ''tough, funny, and plausible in a dreadful kind of way.'' DEEP BLACK: Space Espionage and National Security, by William E. Burrows. (Berkley, $4.95) The work of the National Reconnaissance Office, which designs and manages spy satellites, is considered so sensitive that, on the books, the agency doesn't exist. ''As described by Mr. Burrows, the routine activities of manned and unmanned systems deployed in space, the upper atmosphere, at sea and on earth seem more remarkable than exploits of human spies,'' John Newhouse said here in 1987. BOY, by Roald Dahl. (Penguin, $6.95). For almost a decade, Roald Dahl was held captive in English boys' schools, Dickensian places where children waged war against monstrous disciplinarians. ''These autobiographical stories are as frightening and funny as his fiction,'' Hazel Rochman said here in 1985. ''They have the intense drama and simplicity of the fairy tale, and its unequivocal extremes of good and evil.''",1988-12-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"MINE ENEMY. By Amalia Barnea and Aharon Barnea. Translated by Chaya Amir. (Grove, $17.95.) At the end of ''Mine Enemy,'' Amalia and Aharon Barnea's account of how the Israeli couple come to respect and even love a Palestinian ''terrorist,'' the reader is left uncertain as to who the villains are in the Middle East. This is the measure of the success of the book, a best seller in Hebrew, now smoothly translated by Chaya Amir. ''Mine Enemy'' traces the Barneas' relationship with Lieut. Col. Salah Ta'mari, a commander of the Palestine Liberation Organization's forces who was captured during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Mr. Barnea, the Arab affairs correspondent for Israel Radio, was offered the first interview; he arrived hot for the story but cold toward the colonel. He then had to reconcile his stereotype of a Palestinian with this student of T. S. Eliot who compares Zionists with Herod. If these are not complexities enough, Colonel Ta'mari is married to Dina Abd el-Hamid, the first wife of King Hussein of Jordan; some of the most disarming passages reflect the Barneas' gee-whiz attitude toward royalty. The journalists (she is a reporter for Yediot Aharonot, Israel's biggest newspaper) serve as go-betweens while Colonel Ta'mari is in jail, and win permission to take him on outings. Woven into the tale of unlikely friendship are biographies of the colonel and the queen, and eventually the Barneas' little girl is playing with Queen Dina's little grandson. This seems an obvious symbol for the brotherhood of man, but the Barneas serve it up without saccharine. Some of their analyses are simplistic: if the P.L.O. hides a military bunker under a hospital, can it protest the bombing of the hospital? But these do not detract from this readable description of the emotional morass of the Middle East.",1988-12-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Drexel Decides On a Guilty Plea,"Drexel Burnham Lambert agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a $650 million fine to resolve a Federal investigation of securities- law violations. The largest-ever settlement came in a two-year-old case that centered on Drexel's dealings with the arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, who is serving a prison term for insider trading. Drexel's board voted 16 to 6 to accept the settlement. The firm's chief executive, Frederick H. Joseph, voted against the deal but then had to try to put the best face on it, both to the press and to Drexel employees, who were said to be bitterly divided. The strongest opposition reportedly came from associates of Michael R. Milken, the trader who created ''junk bond'' financing of big takeovers and made Drexel a Wall Street powerhouse. It is widely expected that Mr. Milken, who was not mentioned in the settlement and has denied any wrongdoing, will be indicted soon. Largely because of Mr. Milken, Drexel has been highly profitable in recent years and the big fine is not expected to pose a financial problem. The settlement also avoids a long trial on much more serious charges, including racketeering. Nevertheless, a guilty plea is expected to cost Drexel some customers and encourage lawsuits against the firm. The settlement still has to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. *",1988-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Its cupola will rise nearly 400 feet. Its cost has been estimated at $200 million. Mr. Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled the Ivory Coast since it won independence from France in 1960, is Africa's longest-serving head of state and, at the age of 83, its oldest.

Whether playing the ecstatic tissue-tearing child, the photographing parent, the maidenly aunt or avuncular uncle, we are never more ''literary'' than we are on Christmas morning. As the saying goes, we ''make a Christmas'' for one another, through our real-life behavior, creating a story along such formulaic lines that writing fiction about Christmas is somehow painting the lily, if you will, sugaring the sugarplum. Of course this redundancy hasn't stopped us from making the Yuletide tales of Dickens, O. Henry and Clement Moore some of the best-known stories of all time, but one would think we might be satisfied with documentary Christmases.

A taxpayer bailout is almost a certainty. DEPOSIT INSURANCE: The Government's blanket guarantee of deposit insurance contributed to the savings and loan crisis. Experts say some limits need to be placed on it. LEVERAGED BUYOUTS: The $24.88 billion RJR Nabisco buyout highlighted the issue of potential abuses by management of leveraged buyouts. Congress and the S.E.C. will consider requiring fuller disclosure, conflict-of-interest laws, and reducing the tax advantage of these transactions. GLASS-STEAGALL REFORM: While the Senate passed a bill in 1988 giving banks expanded underwriting powers, it languished in a divided House. The banking lobby plans to resurrect the question of whether to modify Glass-Steagall and let banks underwrite more securities. POST-CRASH MEASURES: Despite endless deliberations, Congress failed to pass any substantive legislation to deal with market structure problems highlighted by the October 1987 stock market crash. Proposals such as raising margin requirements on stock index futures and requiring detailed reporting of large program trades are likely to arise again, but may have the same fate.",1988-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,It Was No Joke: The Coach Was Sick,"One of the first things the Sacramento Kings' coach, Jerry Reynolds, requested after an ambulance took him to an emergency room Tuesday night was a bag of popcorn and a beer. That kind of joking is typical of the popular coach. In fact, Reynolds is so known for his jokes and courtside antics that most of the 16,517 fans who saw him collapse and lose consciousness during the Kings' victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in Sacramento, Calif., Tuesday night thought it was a stunt. Even his players at first thought Reynolds was joking, and Referee Blaine Reichelt called a technical foul against the Kings, assuming that Reynolds had thrown himself onto the floor to mock an earlier call Reichelt made against the Kings. But the 44-year-old coach wasn't joking when he collapsed during the game. Although there were early fears that Reynolds had suffered a heart attack, the Kings' team physician, Dr. James Castles, said yesterday that Reynolds showed no evidence of a heart attack in tests conducted so far.

The victory capped an 8-3-1 season for Indiana. South Carolina ended the year 8-4. The Gamecocks never have won a bowl game, dropping to 0-8 with the loss. Collin Mackie had kicked a 43-yard field goal for South Carolina, making it 20-10. But Schnell then put the game away on the first play of the fourth quarter. He spotted Turner behind the secondary and Turner pulled in the pass at the Gamecocks' 40. He never was touched on the longest scoring pass in Liberty Bowl history.(AP) HOCKEY Nordiques 4, Whalers 4: Walt Poddubny scored a power-play goal with less than six minutes left in the third period as Nordiques rallied for the tie in Quebec last night. Poddubny took a drop pass from Peter Stastny just inside the Whalers' blue line, skated to edge of the left face-off circle and unleashed a hard wrist shot that eluded the goaltender, Peter Sidorkiewicz. (AP) Sabres 4, Red Wings 1: Rick Vaive, playing his first game with Buffalo after being acquired from Chicago, scored one goal and assisted on another to help lead the Sabres in Buffalo last night. Vaive, who came to the Sabres in exchange for Adam Creighton on Monday, scored the game-winner at 9:09 of the second period as the Sabres won their fourth straight game and extended their unbeaten streak to six. (AP) Jets 6, Blues 2: Dale Hawerchuk's second goal of the game capped a three-goal outburst in a 75-second span of the third period as Winnipeg ended a five-game winless streak last night. Hawerchuk, usually a center but playing left wing on a line with Thomas Steen and right winger Pat Elynuik, also collected an assist as the Jets snapped an 0-4-1 slide.(AP) Blackhawks 4, North Stars 3: Denis Savard scored a shorthanded goal and newly acquired Adam Creighton had the game-winner in a four-goal second period Wednesday, sparking Chicago to a 4-3 victory over Minnesota and giving coach Mike Keenan his 200th career triumph. Following a scoreless first period in which the two teams were a combined 0-for-8 on the power play, Steve Larmer's 18th goal of the season got the Blackhawks on the board at 9:50 of the second period. But Basil McRae countered at 12:47, beating Darren Pang on a wraparound.(AP) TENNIS Petrushenko Advances: Valdimir Petrushenko of the Soviet Union, last year's runner-up and seeded seventh this year, came back for a 6-7, 6-2, 6-1 victory over Travis Boyd of Castleton, N.Y., to advance to the quarterfinals yesterday of the boys 18-and-under division of the Port Washington (L.I.)

The floor looks great at first, but after a while it starts looking dull. Any solution? A.Linseed oil is a poor choice for this purpose. It never completely dries, and the tacky finish holds dust and dirt. That is why your porch floor looks dull. Also, linseed oil eventually oxidizes and turns dark, and it is susceptible to mildew. For all these reasons, the oil should be washed off with a remover. The floor can then be treated with a clear wood preservative containing a water repellent. The color will change in time, but then you can apply a stain to restore the color. Q. I recently removed some cheap 20-year-old plywood panels from the painted dry wall in my house. But there remain large blotches and streaks of a hard tan adhesive that was used to paste the panels up. I tried various solvents - water, lighter fluid, etc. - but none worked. I also tried scraping, but this damaged the face of the dry wall. Power sanding works, but this is very slow and tedious. Do you know of a solvent I can use? A.Not knowing what kind of adhesive was used makes it impossible to recommend a solvent. I don't think a solvent is the answer. Any solvent that would work would probably be highly flammable and dangerous to use indoors, and it could soften the paper facing on the dry wall.",1988-12-29T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Blocking Winter Sun,"The winter sun is lower in the sky, but it still shines brightly, and eyes require just as much protection as they do in summer. Tinted prescription glasses or nonprescription sunglasses will block much of this uncomfortable light and shield eyes from the wind, dust and dirt. For winter sports, glasses should offer adequate protection against ultraviolet light, and the frames should be designed for the sport. If not, the lenses can pop out. The frames should be cushioned and sharp edges should be covered in case of a fall. Impact-resistant lenses, particularly those made of polycarbonates, increase safety. Any lens color that allows the wearer to distinguish between red and green and absorbs 70 percent to 85 percent of light is suitable. Here are some other tips on winter glasses. Lenses: Polycarbonate lenses offer the most protection against breakage, but they tend to scratch more easily. Coatings: Most plastic lenses incorporate material that blocks ultraviolet light. Additional coatings cannot hurt. Antireflective coatings make thick glasses look thinner and reduce glare. Never combine antireflective coatings with scratch-resistant coatings. Fittings: Make sure a licensed optician measures the optical center of the eye with a ruler or pupillometer so that the glasses are aligned properly.
