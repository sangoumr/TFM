Crampton's round tied the Elks Country Club Highlands course record set by Miller Barber at the 1987 Classic. Crampton has a two-round total of 10-under 132, and with 18 holes left, he is a stroke in front of Tommy Aaron, who shot a 67, and the first-round leader, Homero Blancas, who followed his 65 Friday with a 68. Crampton, winner of 14 PGA Tour events and 19 events on the Senior Tour, made bogeys on the second and fourth holes. He followed with birdies on four of the last five holes on the front nine and seven holes on the back -- including five straight from No. 11 to No. 15. (AP) Brooks Is Ahead: Mark Brooks, the defending champion, took a one-stroke lead over Richard Zokol in the Greater Milwaukee Open in Frankin, Wis. Brooks stands at 15-under-par 201 after shooting a 65 at the Tuckaway Country Club. ""The day started with a bad drive and a bad bunker shot on the first hole,"" said Brooks, who shot seven birdies and no bogeys yesterday. ""It sounds strange but a lot of times it's a good way to start. It maybe takes some of the pressure off being as precise as you'd like to be."" Zokol, who won the Deposit Guarantee Classic in April, is at 14-under 202 after a 64 yesterday. Jay Haas holds third at 12-under, and Nick Price, Dudley Hart and David Frost are bunched at 11-under-par. (AP) CYCLING United States Women Win 50K Race The United States made up for two successive disappointing years by winning the women's 50-kilometer team time trial yesterday in the world championships in Benidorm, Spain, edging the defending gold medalists from France. Bunki Bankaitis-Davis, Eve Stephenson, Jan Bolland and Jeanne Golay were clocked in 1 hour 3 minutes 30.7 seconds, more than 12 seconds ahead of the French and just over 46 seconds in front of the third-place Russians. The United States women won the silver medal in 1990, but wound up fourth last year when one of their riders was thought to have had an off day in her performance. That rider, Maureen Manley, was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Yesterday, the Americans had the fastest time at 17 kilometers, the first checkpoint. At the 30-kilometer mark, the United States was still up by just under 10 seconds over the French, who closed from fifth to second but could get no closer over a hilly course that was to the Americans' liking.

us,The Diet From Hell,"Josie, the hospitalized, anorexic narrator of Jenefer Shute's remarkable first novel, LIFE-SIZE (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95), desperately wishes for control. Weighing 69 1/2 pounds, the graduate school dropout is convinced that her mind has ""never been purer and less cluttered, concentrated on essentials instead of distracted by a body clamoring for attention, demanding that its endless appetites be appeased."" Lying on the bed in the creamy white room, she believes she can prove she's in charge by fighting the hospital's regime. She makes an excruciating ritual of every meal. At the big weigh-in, she reminds herself that ""if I've gained weight, I starve for the rest of the day. But if I've lost weight, I starve too."" Poor Josie. The anorexic's inability to perceive how fat or thin she really is, her struggle with her body's needs, her obsession with the diet articles she has memorized and that she repeats like mantras and, perhaps most of all, the huge amounts of time and energy Josie invests in deciding what to eat and what not to eat may seem to make an unlikely plot for a novel. But the reader becomes absorbed in Josie's plunge into hell and her heroic, if tentative, journey back to sanity. Alas, Ms. Shute has difficulty explicating other factors in Josie's illness. Her family and its contribution to her condition are mentioned almost in passing and neither convince nor compel the reader. The flashbacks and scenes of therapy with her parents have a strange, tacked-on quality. But over all, ""Life-Size"" is undistanced and therein lies its power. There is no trace of preciousness or cynicism to hold the reader back from Josie's struggle. Though grossly physical in its expressions and longings, anorexia is shown to be a spiritual disease, a hunger and a fear of hunger that finally have nothing to do with food.",1992-09-06T05:00:00+0000

Actually nothing prepares you to teach second-graders. You know, for those kids - for a lot of us - education was our hope for a better life. So if this former school-teacher goes to the U.S. Senate, I'll fight my heart out for full funding of Head Start - and for college loans for middle-class families. We've spent a lot of time and money trying to solve the whole world's problems. Now let's solve some of our own."" Narrator: ""Gerry Ferraro. Fighting for change is more than a slogan. It's her life."" PRODUCER: Doak, Shrum, Harris, Sherman, Donilon of Washington. ON THE SCREEN: Ms. Ferraro in a classroom, standing, walking and sitting on a desk, looking squarely into the camera. On the line, ""Nothing prepares you to teach second-graders,"" she gives just the hint of a rueful smile. In the final image, her slogan appears on the screen over silent footage of her talking with a little girl. ACCURACY: From 1956 to 1961, Ms. Ferraro taught second and fourth grades at Public School 85 in Queens. The Federal Head Start early-education program now reaches only about one-quarter of eligible children; she has pledged to support extending it to all eligible children. She favors creating a national trust fund to lend money to any student who qualifies for higher education, to be repaid through a small percentage of income collected by the Internal Revenue Service, or by performing a few years of community service as a teacher or police officer, for example SCORECARD: The title of this ad, Ms. Ferraro's fifth, might be ""Ms Chips Goes to Washington,"" and it is her strongest effort yet to deflect her rivals' charges about questionable business dealings. It starts out gentle, sentimental, even witty - evoking the warm feelings and shiny apples any teacher ever won. It ends with Ms. Ferraro adopting her favorite stance of common-sense Super Mom, tough and warm at once, and vowing to fight on behalf of American families the way voters have already seen her fight for her own.

us,Business Diary: August 30 - September 4,"INTERNATIONAL Failing Pravda Gets a Partner When Pravda was founded in Moscow by Vladimir Lenin in 1912 as the official organ of the Soviet Communist Party, its purpose was to be the party's ""agitator and organizer."" But with the Soviet Union dissolved and the Communist Party having fallen on hard times, Pravda has seen its circulation shrink from 10 million in 1987, to less than 1.4 million. And more than once it has found itself on the wrong side of history: when it supported last year's failed coup and when it opposed many of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms. Pravda -- it means truth -- also saw its revenues decline. Last March it was forced to shut down for three weeks while it arranged emergency bank loans. Last week, Pravda's editor-in-chief, Gennady Seleznyov, announced he had found a savior for the paper -- and he's certainly no Lenin. For an undisclosed amount, Greek businessman Yannis Yannikos will buy a 55 percent interest in Pravda. The Rights to Fly Countries guard their airlines jealously against too much competition. But last week, the United States and the Netherlands agreed on broad new aviation pact that could change all that. The agreement will allow airlines in each country the rights to fly anywhere in the other country. ""This is a very significant event in international aviation,"" said Secretary of Transporation Andrew E. Card Jr. ""Not only does it cement an extremely close relationship, but it will provide a mood for market-oriented aviation agreements with other countries."" The immediate impact of the agreement is to allow KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which owns 49 percent of Northwest Airlines, and Northwest to operate as a single airline, with antitrust immunity. Previous treaties had prohibited the two airlines from coordinating their pricing, routes and flight schedules. The Department of Transportaton is though to be putting pressure on Britain to negotiate a similar aviation treaty. Cost-Cutting, Japanese Style Dai Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, is cutting costs Japanese style. Rather than laying off low-level clerks, it is asking its 41 top executives to take 5 percent pay cuts and has asked them to trim 20 percent off their expense accounts. Those executives must certainly do a lot of entertaining. According to Yoshihide Akazawa, a spokesman for the company, the cuts -- along with a few others -- are expected to save an estimated $40 million a year. ECONOMY Politician Bush Has a Little Something for Taiwan and U.S. Farmers President Bush has been loathe to anger China. He opposed sanctions after the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square and fought hard for China to keep its most-favored-nation trade status. But this is an election year and last week -- at a General Dynamics Corporation plant in Fort Worth -- Mr. Bush said he had approved the sale of 150 of the company's F-16 fighters to Taiwan, China's long-time foe. The sale could be worth $6 billion over 10 years to American companies in Texas, California and Connecticut. The same day, in South Dakota, Mr. Bush -- a staunch foe of agricultural subsidies in this year's trade negotiations with Europe -- said he had approved $1 billion to subsidize American wheat sales abroad and another $755 million to aid farmers whose crops were damaged by Hurricane Andrew. ""This is pure pork-barrel politics,"" said Dee Dee Myers, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger. Outlook: Stagnant to Grim Behind every President there are economists. But George Bush's economic mavens must be feeling a little uneasy. Last week's report from the Commerce Department on the Index of Leading Economic Indicators showed the pace of growth at just 0.1 percent in July after a 0.3 percent decline the month before. The index, which forecasts economic activity six to nine months hence, suggests a slower economy in first quarter of next year. ""The economy is essentially dead,"" said Lawrence Chimerine, of DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. More Poverty for All Sluggish economic growth? How about plain poverty? The Census Bureau said last week that the number of Americans living in poverty increased by 2.1 million last year to a total of 35.7 million or 14.2 percent of the population. It was the second consecutive annual increase in the poverty rate. What's more, there are now more people living in poverty in America than at any time since 1964. The purchasing power of the average household also shrank last year by $1,100, the bureau said. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater blamed the increase in the poverty rate on Congress's inability to pass the Administration's economic proposals. Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, blamed it on the Administration saying it has the ""worst economic record in 50 years."" Handling Hurricane Andrew Tallying up the damage from a disaster as vast as Hurricane Andrew is no mean feat. But last week estimates began to trickle in. The American Insurance Services Group, a nonprofit research organization, figures Andrew will cost insurance companies about $7.3 billion. But those estimates do not include uninsured losses, losses in Louisiana, damage to the infrastructure and damage to Government-owned installations. Though Andrew is the costliest natural disaster ever, analysts believe the insurance industry -- with $160 billion in capital -- will be able to take the hit. ""The one thing this industry is very effective at is spreading risk,"" said G. Alan Zimermann, an analyst with Prudential Securities. No Glee in Purchasing If the nation's purchasing managers are the economy's weathervane, they are saying there's hardly a breeze. Last week, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its Purchasing Mangers Index fell to 53.7 from 54.2. A reading above 50 indicates economy is growing, below 50 indicates it is contracting. Fed Acts on Jobless Numbers Though unemployment fell to 7.6 percent in August, from 7.7 percent in July, it was accompanied by an alarming loss of 83,000 jobs from the nation's nonfarm payrolls and -- if government employment is excluded from the picture -- an even gloomier loss of 167,000 jobs from the nation's private payrolls. The unemployment numbers show ""a dramatic deterioration in the job market,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. Most of the job losses were concentrated in the transportation, instruments and electronics sectors of the economy. ""This news will not be well received in the White House,"" Mr. Robertson said. In response to the figures, the Federal Reserve lowered its Federal funds rate to 3.0 percent from 3.25 percent, the lowest level since 1963. The move is designed to make it easier for banks to borrow money. COMPANIES Bad Season for Citicorp It hasn't been the best of summers for Citicorp. First the banking examiners identified problems that forced it to revise downward its second-quarter earnings by $28 million, to $143 million. Then a document leaked out from the Comptroller of the Currency's office that criticized the nation's No. 1 bank for the shoddy way it has run its mortgage subsidiary. The report said Citicorp overcharged customers and exposed the bank to undue risks. It did such a poor job at screening out unqualified mortgage applicants that it was unable to sell its mortgages to other institutions. The report also said Citicorp executives ""have neglected their responsibilities to correct identified problems,"" some of which were first pinpointed in 1988. Citicorp said it could not legally comment on the report but that not everything in it was necessarily true. General Mills's Shredded Wheat Last week, General Mills, the nation's No. 2 cereal maker after Kellogg, said it planned to add RJR Nabisco's ready-to-eat cereal business to its Wheaties-led lineup. For $450 million, (no boxtops please) General Mills will get mostly shredded wheat -- in the form of Shreddies, Spoon-Sized Shredded Wheat, Frosted Shredded Wheat and the original, 100-year-old Shredded Wheat. The proceeds from the sale will help RJR pay off the $13.6 billion debt remaining from the $25 billion it borrowed in 1988 to finance a leveraged buyout. RJR's market share in cereals has slipped to 3 percent from 5 percent. ""Nabisco had been on the slide for a long period of time,"" said William Leach, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Because of the increasing concentration in the food business, the deal is expected to be scrutinized by the Government for antitrust violations. Whither Letterman? It's no secret that late-night TV host David Letterman wanted Johnny Carson's old job. He's said so himself. But NBC replaced Mr. Carson with Jay Leno. If last week's reports in Advertising Age are correct, however, Mr. Letterman is determined to leave the network. Though his contract does not allow him to negotiate with anyone until after he has completed talks with NBC, other suitors -- including syndication companies -- have made ""presentations,"" to Mr. Letterman's agents at the Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles. A syndicated show could be far more lucrative -- but riskier -- than staying with a network. NBC said in a statement that Mr. Letterman has been ""a valuable member of the NBC family for the past 10 years,"" and that it wants to keep him right where he is. Mr. Letterman has remained silent. Labor Strife at G.M. The strike at General Motors Corporation's Lordstown complex has spread from a single metal shop to include 30,000 workers, forcing production at its Saturn division to be halted. But this strike is not over wages. Members of the United Automobiles Workers union walked out to protest the replacement of some of G.M.'s tool and die makers with a plan to buy from the outside. To become more competitive, G.M. wants to do more outsourcing; it currently produces 70 percent of all the parts it uses, versus about 40 percent at Toyota. Last week union and management teams met for talks. ""G.M. is in a tough economic position,"" said Harry Katz, professor of labor relations at Cornell University. Both sides are ""looking for bargaining leverage. Now It's Canon-I.B.M. Is there any high-tech company anywhere that hasn't entered an alliance with I.B.M.?

But Dick Hendrickson and Harold Henning bogeyed it to give Gilbert the $60,000 winner's share of the $400,000 purse. Gilbert's 11-under 202 total was two strokes off the tournament record and only one stroke ahead of Hendrickson, Henning, Tommy Aaron and Dave Stockton. Henning shot a 67, Stockton and Hendrickson had 68's and Aaron closed with a 70. (AP)",1992-09-07T05:00:00+0000

Western Hanover covered the mile in 1:531/5 with regular driver Bill Fahy in the bike. Safely Kept was second, 2 1/4 lengths back, and Humstinger was a nose farther back in third.

us,How to Get Dressed Better,"* Your socks should never be funnier than you are. * Unless you have virtually nothing to draw in, avoid drawstring pants. * A belt fits correctly when the buckle's prong goes through the strap's third hole. * If you're high-waisted, avoid high-waisted pants, unless you have an Eddie Haskell fixation. * Maybe you wouldn't be so uncomfortable in the afternoon if you bought your own underwear and knew your own size. * Never wear a plaid jacket to a job interview. * If your teeth don't look healthy, it doesn't matter what you have on. * There is no regulation width or length for ties, so knot one before you buy it. * Don't iron the stuff you buy from L. L. Bean. * The best shoes to dance in are sneakers with no tread left. * Clothes don't make you look fat. Fat does. * If you are tired of apologizing for the I-had-to-work-late-no-time-to-change corporate look, leave one black- and one cream-colored turtleneck or crew-neck sweater in a desk or file-cabinet drawer. * Do you always have to carry every key you own? * Better you should carry a usable handkerchief. * When you need them, keep business cards in your outside breast pocket. * Does Mom come in to clean five times a week? Then hang up your clothes. * Your underwear shouldn't be briefer than your favorite bathing suit. Sooner or later, you're bound to be seen in both. * Love the scent of your deodorant more than life itself? Then don't buy polyester workout clothes. * You needn't smell your own cologne once it's on. * Don't wear an ascot unless you've been there. * Solid white collars atop contrasting shirts belong with a straw boater and an apron someplace where there's sawdust on the floor. * There's no such thing as classy luggage as long as you have to carry it. * Learn to iron. * But never press jeans (if yours have creases, wear them in private, among friends, until they fade). * When wearing suede, eat nothing. * Old favorites saved for ""knocking around in"" are never knocked around in. Many charities would be glad to put them into action. * Old ski-lift tickets are not a fashion accessory. * Don't have muscles? Don't wear muscle T's. * Clothing makes an excellent sunscreen. * When it's below freezing, close your coat. We're not impressed. * Silk shirts are warmer than they look. If you sweat like a showerhead, steer clear of them on big presentation days, when out dancing or on a first date. * Use shoe trees. * Paisley goes with nothing. * If you're over 5 feet 5 inches tall and remember how it felt when Marilyn Monroe died, don't ever wear overalls again. * Unless the corona from a total eclipse is coming through the skylight, take the sunglasses off indoors. * Get your hair cut a week before the big day. * Literally tuck yourself into a bathing suit. These things don't take care of themselves. * Brush your teeth before putting on anything more than underwear -- ever try to get toothpaste off a tie? * If you're going to sit for a long time on a trip, take your wallet out of your back pocket, even if you know a good chiropractor at your destination. * If you wear boots often, try a boot wallet. * Think a blue blazer goes everywhere? Think twice before you go anywhere. * If you must have a blue blazer, and you must, buy the best one you can afford. * Though you're disappointed you weren't born with a family crest, pray for one in your next life and live without one in this. * Thin, wiry shoelaces need to be double-knotted. * To remove the old hem mark from a let-down pair of pants, soak the line in white vinegar and then press with a warm iron. * For those who insist on going sockless in even the steamiest of climates, remember you can always throw sweaty socks into the wash, but loafers tend to give it up in the spin cycle. * Pinky rings look so cool -- in a Scorsese film. * Beware of showroom sales-fever reasoning: i.e., ""for $20 . . ."" Once you're home, how little you paid is forgotten; how good you look in it is all that matters. * If you must have your clothes monogrammed, do it where it can't be seen. * Tweeze your nose hairs: both the ones inside and the ones on top. * If you're over 40, your ears need a haircut, too. * The invitation says ""black tie."" How come she opts for a dress kept lovingly wrapped in tissue paper, while you rent a been-to-the-dry-cleaners-more-times-than-Vicki-Carr's-sung-""It Must Be Him"" dinner jacket? Be a grown-up and buy your own tuxedo. * Massages relax you, and the more relaxed you are, the better you look in your clothes. * White jeans are not out of season in winter. White leather shoes are not in season ever. * A wide tie looks good hanging just below the belt; a regular-width tie looks good just above the belt, and a thin tie can be tucked into the shirt between the third and fourth buttons. * The only time you're not better off shopping alone is when buying eyeglass frames. * A little flannel goes a long way. * Despite their prevalence, button-down oxfords worn under double-breasted jackets are more the Fred and Ethel than the Lucy and Ricky of fashion. * More people look better in solid navy than in solid black. * Don't pull loose threads. Cut them. * Jewelry on the beach is arriving by the pailful. Just remember before diving into the surf that sharks love shiny things. * Don't waste money on cologne if you smoke. * Buy shoes in the late afternoon. * ""You have to break them in"" is an old wives' tale. Shoes should feel good before you hand over the charge card. * If you're not active, don't buy activewear. * Use a moisturizer as often as a woman -- every time you wash your face. * Loosening or taking off your tie does not make you look sporty. It makes you look drunk. * When confronted by a person with reflective aviator glasses, look him square in the eye and then start fixing your hair. * If you like something that much, buy two of them. You may not see it again. * Don't wear a belt and suspenders. * Safari jackets look pretentious when you're on one, and too far out of Africa when you're not. * There's nothing wrong with buying a fur coat, as long as you're giving it to someone who goes to a gynecologist. * Don't hang up sweaters, not even cardigans, or the woman in your life will soon belt one and wear it with leggings. * There's a time and a place for everything, except dickies. * Don't organize your clothes closet by outfit. * In a random survey, not one tailor knew what ""single-needle tailoring"" was. (One asked, ""How many needles do you need to tailor a suit?"") If they don't know, why should you? * Names of fabric colors have gotten bizarre, less to confuse you than to maintain clear communication between designer and mill.

us,Science Fiction,"Literal-minded critics have sometimes derided science fiction as subliterary ""escapism,"" because it does not deal, in so many words, with the here-and-now. J. R. R. Tolkien, who wrote ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" defended all imaginative literature from such charges by drawing a distinction between escape and desertion: while few applaud desertion, our reaction to a prison escape depends on whether we identify with the prisoner or the jailer. In a savvy introduction to his fine collection of stories, MEETING IN INFINITY (Arkham House, $20.95), John Kessel confesses that when he was 12 years old, reading science fiction was his sole means of escape from ""the feeling of being trapped that, sadly, so many children feel."" The 14 stories in this collection confirm that while the mature Mr. Kessel still identifies with prisoners, he uses science fiction not to avoid or deny life's encumbrances but to confront and comprehend them.",1992-09-13T05:00:00+0000

In the Trenches for Vogue","Born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and gifted with a photographer's eye and a capacity for hard work, to say nothing of striking physical beauty, Lee Miller (1907-77) was a top model for Vogue and a glittering adjunct to the Surrealist circle in Paris in the 1920's and 30's and to the art world of London in the days after the fall of France. In 1944 she became a combat photographer for British Vogue, covering the European campaign from Normandy to the end in Bavaria a year later. LEE MILLER'S WAR: Photographer and Correspondent With the Allies in Europe 1944-45 (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $45) is a collection of her photographs and dispatches edited by her son, Anthony Penrose, with an introduction by her fellow photographer David E. Scherman, who covered the war for Life magazine. At a time when women war correspondents were generally relegated to the rear areas, she went everywhere and photographed everything -- or rather everyone, for people were her specialty: soldiers, both friend and foe; shaven-headed Frenchwomen who had fraternized with the occupying Germans; refugees; nuns poking through rubble for the body of their parish priest. She covered the liberation of Paris, the winter war in Alsace, the horror of the newly freed Dachau concentration camp and, finally, the burning of Hitler's Bavarian redoubt at Berchtesgaden. The black-and-white photographs are accompanied by lucid and sensitive prose. After nearly 50 years, this chronicle is a most valuable addition to the literature of World War II, as well as a marvelous memorial to a talented and courageous woman.",1992-09-13T05:00:00+0000

On the other side, craggy cliffs give way to the Sea of Okhotsk, swirling between Kunashir and the nearby islands of Etorofu and Shikotan to form a crucial portal to the Pacific for the once mighty Soviet fleet.

us,"God, I Hope I Get It!","No deodorant ad can approximate the stress, the agonized wishin'-'n'-hopin', the psyching for ""final Jeopardy"" that accompany the job interview. So it's imperative not to forget that your best shot does not start with a firm handshake, a winning smile or the first question fired by the affable Lord High Executioner behind the desk. The interview begins the moment you open the door. So stand out but don't stick out. Two weeks from your meeting, if your interviewer says, ""Remember the guy, the one with the great vest . . . ,"" your clothes have done a good job. If you've been equally memorable, you may get to do one, too. ""What you wear at a first meeting makes a huge impact because it indicates how aware you are of your surroundings. The key is grooming and understatement: a dark-colored suit, polished lace-up shoes, a pale shirt in a nice fabric. I'd be impressed by a moderate European-cut suit that doesn't call too much attention to itself. Even a double-breasted jacket is a little pushy for an entry-level position. But understatement does not mean underdressing. No sport jackets, button-down shirts, penny loafers, boots, funny suspenders or cuff links. Go for the richness, not brightness, of color and fabric -- like a woven tie. Make your impression with subtlety."" CHAD LEAT Managing Director, Chase Manhattan Bank ""I'm impressed when someone doesn't wear his best suit to an interview. This is not a wedding. It's much smarter to dress just a little bit better than the customer you'll eventually be dealing with. Not flashier, just more affluent. I'm pleased by someone who looks as if he hasn't bought the outfit whole and then wears it that way all the time. Penny loafers and wingtips signify sure-fire bores. Monograms and pocket handkerchiefs lack originality. Spend a little more on a pair of shoes. One tip: You can tell a man knows how to dress by the way he matches his shirt collar to his suit."" BILL MCDERMOTT District Market Development Manager, Apple Computer ""Different jobs have different criteria. Writers should look as if they fell out of a bar. Account executives should wear classics with a twist: colorful blazers, soft wool pants. Art directors should art-direct themselves. If one shows up in black with a ponytail, I know he never got out of the 80's. For someone in accounting, however, polyester is a plus. It says, 'I don't care about fashion; I care about collecting your money.' But most important is to see how people dress normally. I don't like it when two weeks after a new employee begins, the earrings go in. I recently had a person admit he couldn't stay late on Tuesdays because he had mambo lessons. Fine. Honesty helps."" RICHARD KIRSHENBAUM Executive Creative Director, Kirshenbaum & Bond ""An interview is unlike other conversational situations because there are going to be judgments made all along the way. What I'm looking for is a person who's comfortable with his own package. When someone dresses in a manner unlike his normal habit, it always shows. Dress at the upper end of your daily repertoire. True, in my profession, anything goes, but what impresses me most is when, within 60 seconds, I no longer see the clothes and begin to focus on the person. If I were interviewing me, I'd wear a dress shirt, open at the collar; the best belt I could find, because it's a detail that isn't oppressive; jeans, for sure, because they're the only comfortable pants for me, and casual shoes.

us,D'Amato on the Attack,"Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato began his television advertising campaign yesterday against his Democratic opponent, Robert Abrams, with four commercials appearing across the state. THE SCRIPT: Announcer's voice: ""Al D'Amato. Bob Abrams. The difference is clear. ""Al D'Amato wants to cut taxes and freeze spending. Bob Abrams plans to raise taxes on all families earning $36,000 and individuals earning $22,000. ""Al D'Amato supports the balanced budget amendment. Bob Abrams wants a 6 percent tax on every job in America. ""That's just plain wrong. Bob Abrams taxes and spends. Bob Abrams, hopelessly liberal. PRODUCER: Russo Marsh & Assoc. of Sacramento, Calif. ON THE SCREEN: Frozen images of a smiling Mr. D'Amato wearing a white shirt against a red and blue background, and Mr. Abrams, frowning, against a black background. Words fromthe spoken text appear. The candidate's pictures alternate rather than appearing side byside, because, Tony Marsh of Russo Marsh said, they look alike. ACCURACY: Mr. D'Amato is using Mr. Abrams's support for the national health care program of Representative Marty Russo of Illinois to support his claim that Mr. Abrams wants to raise taxes. The Russo plan would impose tax increases to pay for the health insurance. The Russo plan would tax families earning about $51,000 or more. Those earning $51,000 would have taxable incomes of $36,000, the figure Mr. D'Amato's ad cites. Families earning a gross income of $36,000 would not be affected. Similarly, only individuals earning more than $27,550, with a taxable income of $22,000, would pay more. Mr. Abrams's spokesman, Timothy Gilles, said that Mr. Abrams has never endorsed the taxing structure of Mr. Russo's legislation tro finance the program. He has said that a payroll tax would be a good way to finance a national health care program. The D'Amato ad translates that into Mr. Abrams's support of a 6 percent tax on every job. What is not included in any of Mr. D'Amato's calculations are health-cost savings that could help families and businesses offset tax increases. SCORECARD: Mr. D'Amato's ad creates the misleading impression that Mr. Abrams has endorsed several specific tax increases.

The opening flourish, on Wednesday, used the brassy swagger of popular 20th-century suites by Prokofiev and Bernstein and a group of reflective Strauss songs to present the orchestra as a sleek, flexible symphonic engine. By contrast, the season's first subscription concert, on Thursday evening, showed off the orchestra's virtuosity from a different perspective.

He does not intimidate or manipulate the viewer, but uses unfinished edges and trenchant captions inscribed across the photographs to illustrate man's relationship with the land. Mr. Klett does not judge the effects of this alliance; he presents it in a highly specific, imaginative, personal manner. A lone creosote bush reveals, on close scrutiny, a man standing behind, looking not at the camera but away, at the distant landscape; the image of a gun found in the sand shows a small, dark symbol of man's violence amid the vast, pale smoothness of the desert; a U-Haul truck is pulled off a highway in Monument Valley as some present-day pioneers consult a map. Mr. Klett lives in Arizona, studied geology in college and has worked on the Rephotographic Survey Project, an effort to take new pictures of locations in the Southwest originally shot in the 1860's and 70's.

us,'Leviathan',"In the work of the contemporary French photographer Sophie Calle, the everyday rituals of strangers inspire images that reveal anonymous lives as art. For Ms. Calle, spying began as an unorthodox way of reacquainting herself with Paris after a long absence, and she studied the behavior of randomly chosen citizens in order to determine her own. By the time she began recording her observations with a camera, she had parlayed her chance pursuits into a profession: she had become an artist. That her subjects were unaware of her surveillance allowed Ms. Calle to reinvent their identities, and thereby her own. It is more than politeness that makes Paul Auster preface his seventh novel, ""Leviathan,"" with thanks to Ms. Calle for ""permission to mix fact with fiction."" This acknowledgment is a clue to Mr. Auster's methodology in a work in which fictional lives are circumscribed by recorded events, and real people shape the destinies of conjured ones. The disparity between reality and its reinvention is choice terrain for artists who seek to seduce their audiences with a sense of familiarity, only to abandon them in unexpected but no less memorable places. Yet if Ms. Calle happened to land here on her journey of self-discovery, Mr. Auster's presence is intentional. He uses hints of the real world to anchor an otherwise implausible tale, and to authenticate the coincidences against which his characters collide.",1992-09-20T05:00:00+0000

L/G Research Inc., a San Francisco money manager that invests in no-load funds, says it does not usually pay to put your money in bonds. At least not when you compare the results with that of stocks. L/G studied the return on stocks versus bonds in 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year periods, and found that stocks almost always beat bonds. Indeed, over 15-year periods, stocks do better 94 percent of the time, L/G said. The average one-year return of 12.4 percent by stocks is more than double that of bonds in the 55-year period that was studied, said Ken Gregory, editor of the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter. Like most good things, though, the happy returns come at a price. Stocks are riskier, Mr. Gregory said, declining more than bonds in bad years. The worst 12-month performance of bonds was a 5 percent loss, he said, while the worst year for stocks was a 50 percent loss.

And no chemicals like isopropyl myristate and t-butyl hydroquinone. By definition cruelty free, these lipsticks take pains to avoid animal byproducts. Notable trade-off: Aveda abstains from carmine, a deep red coloring harvested from the shells of Peruvian beetles, but for texture and staying power, it uses lanolin, which comes from sheep's wool.

Floyd, who turned 50 years old earlier this month, birdied five of his last seven holes to win the G.T.E. North Classic in Indianapolis and become the first golfer to win tournaments on both the regular and Senior PGA tours in the same year. He won the Doral-Ryder Open in March on the regular tour and added yesterday's victory in only his second start as a senior. Floyd's six-under-par 66 gave him a 17-under 199 total, two shots ahead of Mike Hill. Floyd matched the tournament record set last year by George Archer and won $67,500, which he announced he would donate to the PGA Tour's hurricane relief fund. (AP) Frost Holds On for Victory: David Frost, despite posting four birdies and six bogeys, held on for a three-stroke victory in the Hardee's Golf Classic in Coal Valley, Ill. Frost, who won the Buick Classic in June, shot a two-over-par 72 for a 14-under 266 total. He protected his five-stroke lead with birdies on two of the first three holes, but then bogeyed three of the next six holes. After rain delay of 1 hour 22 minutes, Frost bogeyed Nos. 14, 15 and 16, allowing Loren Roberts to pull within a stroke. But Roberts bogeyed his last two holes to finished with a 70 and a 269 total, tied for second with Tom Lehman, who also shot 70. Jay Delsing, who shot a 68, was fourth at 271.

Verdi's libretto by Antonio Somma was based on the assassination of a Swedish king at a masked ball in the Stockholm opera house in 1792. But the censors in Naples in 1857 objected to setting it too close to home in either space or time. So Somma thought of moving it to Pomerania (""an independent duchy in the 12th century"").

us,A History of Hate,"In his capacity as an adviser to a British television series entitled ""The Longest Hatred,"" Robert S. Wistrich, who teaches modern European history at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has put together as good a one-volume overview of anti-Semitism as exists in English. ANTISEMITISM: The Longest Hatred (Pantheon, $25) is not, for the most part, a work of original research but rather a comprehensive and balanced report on the mass of research that has been done, some of it by the prolific Mr. Wistrich himself. ""Antisemitism"" begins with a masterly account of enmity toward the Jews from pre-Christian times through the Holocaust, including its aftermath in Germany and Austria. There then follows a series of chapters on anti-Semitism in England, the United States, France, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. A final section deals with the Arab world, where the struggle with Israel has resulted in a grafting of the whole vile tradition of Christian European anti-Semitism onto Islam's historically less hostile approach to the Jews. No one can be equally sure-footed in all reaches of this far-flung subject. Mr. Wistrich is at his best describing the transformation of theological Jew hatred into the nationalistic and political anti-Semitism of 19th- and early 20th-century Europe. In his chapter on the United States, he makes a small but unfortunate stumble, claiming that African-Americans, in contrast to white Americans, become more anti-Semitic the better educated they are. That is not the case, although it does appear that anti-Semitism decreases less swiftly with educational level in the black community. Anti-Semitism is a phenomenon whose absence is often as significant as its presence. In this regard, Mr. Wistrich ought to have focused at least as much attention on the evangelical Christian right as on Louis Farrakhan and the Black Muslims. Despite a theology that looks to the eventual conversion of the Jewish people, the Christian right has leaned over backward to signal that Jews are not excluded from its ""Judeo-Christian"" political agenda. There is no greater testimony to the marginalization of anti-Semitism in the United States today.",1992-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Portraits of the Artist","Featuring 60 portraits by such photographers as Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston, FRIDA KAHLO: The Camera Seduced (Lookout/Chronicle, cloth, $29.95; paper, $18.95) is a treasure for admirers of the Mexican painter best known for her self-portraits. The novelist Elena Poniatowska, one of Mexico's leading literary figures, has written a fictional memoir in Kahlo's voice, an annoying technique -- particularly since Kahlo (1907-54) covered similar material in her diary. Carla Stellweg, a freelance curatorial consultant, serves both the painter and the reader much better in her essay. Several photographs by Lucienne Bloch reveal an un-self-conscious Kahlo clowning around; a shot by the artist's nephew Antonio Kahlo shows her uncharacteristically dressed in Chinese pajamas, with her hair loose. Two of the finest photographs are by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, proclaimed Mexico's pre-eminent surrealist photographer by Andre Breton. In one, Kahlo, in traditional Mexican dress, sits next to a large reflecting ball -- the effect being both stately and classical. The camera seduced Kahlo as much as she seduced the camera.

Despite the fact that Mr. Bennett had already had three No. 1 hits -- ""Because of You,"" ""Cold, Cold Heart"" and ""Rags to Riches"" -- he was petrified. He decided to ask his idol, Frank Sinatra, whom he had never met, for advice. ""Everybody had warned me, 'Look out, he's a tough guy,' but I had intuition,"" Mr. Bennett recalls. ""I felt it was gonna be all right."" Backstage at the Paramount Theater, where Mr. Sinatra was appearing, he gave the young singer a fatherly tip: ""Don't worry about being nervous. People don't mind that. It's when you don't care that they walk away from you.""",1992-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Yet defending the franc was more important than money; it was a show of unity after France's lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty.

It never happened. Aoki won without picking up a golf club when rain washed out the final round. Aoki's rain-shortened 36-hole victory was worth $120,000 and deprived Floyd of the opportunity to capture his second consecutive senior event. Aoki, Japan's most accomplished player, turned 50 on Aug. 31, making him eligible for the Senior Tour. He increased his senior earnings to $183,900, in four events. Play began yesterday morning but was suspended at 12:50 P.M. The round was canceled less than an hour later by the heavy rain, and the leaders never started play. Aoki birdied four of his last five holes Saturday for a six-under-par 66 and two-round total of 136. Floyd finished a stroke behind. (AP) Scranton Wins L.P.G.A. Tourney: Nancy Scranton shot a seven-under-par 65 and came from seven strokes back to win the $500,000 Los Coyotes L.P.G.A. Classic, her second victory in eight years on tour. Scranton finished at 279, nine under and one stroke ahead of Meg Mallon, who posted a final-round 70 at Los Coyotes Country Club. Jan Stephenson, leading after three rounds by two shots, slipped to a 75 and ended tied for fourth with Kathy Postlewait. Stephenson, who earned $23,902, became the ninth player in L.P.G.A. history to go over the $2 million mark in earnings. She has now won $2,014,186 since joining the L.P.G.A. Tour in 1974. (AP) Jimenez Wins in Belgium: Miguel Angel Jimenez won a battle with Nick Faldo when the world's top-ranked golfer lost his touch down the stretch of the Belgian Piaget Open in Knokke. It was the Spaniard's first European PGA Tour victory. Jimenez, who broke the Royal Zoute course record with a 64 on Saturday, played squeaky-clean golf on the final day, finishing with a two-under-par 69 that gave him a total of 10-under 274. He finished three strokes ahead of Barry Lane of England. Faldo was leading by three strokes with 10 holes to play, but he found shrubbery, trees and thick rough from there on and finished in a tie for fifth at 279 with Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and Per-Ulrik Johansson. (AP) TENNIS Seles Makes Quick Work of Sabatini Top-ranked Monica Seles, reeling off 11 straight games, overwhelmed second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, 6-2, 6-0, yesterday and won her second consecutive Nichirei International Ladies Championship in Tokyo. Sabatini was shut out after breaking Seles for a 2-1 lead in the first set of the hourlong match, played mostly from the baseline. Seles drilled passing shots past her Argentine opponent on the few occasions when Sabatini rushed the net. In the eighth game of the first set, Sabatini, ranked third in the world, began hitting backhand shots wide. Her hitting remained erratic in the second set. (AP) AUTO RACING Mansell Keeps Roaring Along The world champion, Nigel Mansell of Britain, set a single-season victory record yesterday, leading from start to finish in the Portuguese Grand Prix in Estoril for his ninth triumph of the Formula One season. Mansell, who is leaving Formula One at the end of the campaign to join the Indy-car series in the United States, had been tied with Ayrton Senna of Brazil at eight victories. Senna also won eight times in 1988. The triumph, in a Williams-Renault, was Mansell's 30th over all. He ranks third on the career list, behind three-time world champions Alain Prost of France, who has 44 victories, and Senna, of Brazil, who has 33. Earlier, Williams-Renault announced that Prost, who has not driven this year, would return to racing next year to drive for Williams-Renault. Mansell, who clinched the world title three races ago, started from the pole and finished in 1 hour 34 minutes 46.659 seconds. Gerhard Berger of Austria was second in a McLaren-Honda, 37.533 seconds behind, with the McLaren-Honda driven by Senna third, more than a minute back.
