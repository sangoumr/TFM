Later in the chapter Nelson allows that while political correctness is not the all defining campus cultural force the right makes it out to be, it does operate, in some contexts absurdly. His own example of absurdity (it occurred in his home department) is a faculty appointment that was derailed when it was discovered that the candidate, then teaching in New Zealand, had written a letter to a newspaper criticizing the practice of going barefoot in public places on the grounds that it promoted the spread of disease. A department member decided that the letter was an attack on the Maori people and thus racist, and even when it was determined that it is not the Maori, but white hippies, who go barefoot in New Zealand, the majority voted against pursuing the candidate in order, says Nelson, to prove themselves to colleagues of color.

us,Canada: Economy Out of Recession,"Canadas economy grew for the first time in four quarters from July through September, signaling that the countrys first recession since 1992 has ended. Gross domestic product expanded at a 0.4 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 1 percent annualized gain, based on the median of 19 responses. The second-quarter decrease, initially reported at 3.4 percent, was revised to a 3.1 percent annualized decline. The third-quarter figure is lower than the Bank of Canadas prediction for 2 percent annualized growth. Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of Canada, said last month the growth could come in softer than his formal prediction, adding the profile for a strengthening recovery next year remains intact. There is reason to be optimistic that growth will build for the fourth quarter from todays fairly weak return to positive growth, said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, citing the gain in domestic spending.

This commitment, of course, was hedged with a substantial caveat: We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground.

The Rodin Museum and Versailles were also affected, though much of Versailles was open to visitors. Most of the Louvre was open too, though some rooms were shut, and the entry price was cut by a third for the day. The museums were expected to remain closed on Thursday. The strike was begun by conservationists at the Pompidou Center because of government plans to replace any two civil servants who retired with only one new hire. The rule applies to all government departments, an effort to reduce a huge state work force that largely has guaranteed jobs for life and handsome state pensions.

The city council of King Township, north of Toronto, voted 6-1 to designate the work, completed in 1972, and some of the land around it as a protected cultural landscape under the Ontario Heritage Act, over the objections of the lands owner, Hickory Hills Investments. The townships mayor, Margaret Black, said that while she respected property rights, she felt the importance of the sculpture overrides that, The Toronto Globe and Mail reported, adding that the council had never before granted protected status to any property without the property owners consent. The development company, which has plans to build housing on land near the sculpture, had offered to promise in writing that it would not harm, alter or destroy the work, but council members decided that more comprehensive protection was needed. Reached Wednesday morning, Mr. Serra, above, who built the piece on what was then an isolated cornfield owned by an art collector, said he was elated by the decision to protect a sculpture he considers crucial in the development of his work. He said he had not visited the work since the late 1970s but might do so now. I think at least its a great initial move, he said, and well see what happens now.",2009-12-02T23:23:34+0000

He died in 1996. A third candidate, a banjo and guitar player from Scranton, Pa., Robert Degen, was generally unknown, but he and a partner, Joe Brier, copyrighted a song called The Hokey Pokey Dance in 1944, five years before Mr. LaPrise and his musical group, the Ram Trio, recorded their own, very similar version.

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when federal lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restricted, but the film business is putting out more unrated DVDs that may contain material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for display in theaters. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a survey of shoppers by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising. The gaming industry, the report said, has the strongest self-regulatory code and has generally good compliance with its standards. ",2009-12-03T19:19:04+0000

Deborah Willis, head of New York Universitys photography and imaging department, spent a decade exploring the question.

If you saw 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, the Cristian Mungiu film that won the Palme dOr in 2007 then you would know what all the fuss is about. Now the three-day Romanian Film Festivalwill try to bridge past and present, not just with its title, 4 Years, 3 Days and 2 Decades Later, a play on both the Mungiu movie and the two decades since the 1989 revolution that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu, but also in its programming which highlights the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism. In addition to a number of new films by young directors, the festival also includes a special retrospective section. It opens Friday night at the TriBeCa Cinemas with a screening of Videograms of a Revolution. That 1992 film features amateur video broadcast by Romanian state television after it was taken over by demonstrators in December 1989. ",2009-12-04T03:42:35+0000

Wright II of the United States District Court for the Central District of California has had some interesting bedtime reading over the past few months. Before dismissing a plagiarism case brought by the author Jordan Scott against Stephenie Meyer, above, the author of the blockbuster best-selling Twilight series, Judge Wright (or his clerks) had to read both Breaking Dawn, the fourth and final (we think) installment in the Twilight series, and The Nocturne, Ms. Scotts novel, the first in a projected trilogy, to make extensive comparisons. Ms. Scott had suggested that because of similarities in the novels, involving a wedding, a consummation scene on the beach and a subsequent childbirth, that Ms. Meyer had copied Ms. Scotts work. In a decision filed late last month, Judge Wright ruled that the novels were not substantially similar as a matter of law and admonished Ms. Scott for her deceptive presentation of the alleged similarities. Among the judges many detailed comparisons, he found that the dialogue in both books was substantially different. The speech in The Nocturne, he wrote, is an amalgamation of largely archaic and some modern language that is likely unparalleled in either classical or modern literature. By contrast, the dialogue in Breaking Dawn, he wrote, maintains a very modern and fresh tone throughout the story that is appealing to a younger audience.",2009-12-04T05:34:07+0000

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restrictive, but that the film industry is putting out more unrated DVDs that may include material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for theatrical release. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a shopper survey by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising.

As a result, he wound up the most influential progenitor of much that is spectacular, vulgar, cheerfully phony and just plain fun about American popular culture. Hes not only one of the founders of the circus that still bears his name, but hes also a direct ancestor of everything from Bat Boy in the Weekly World News to all those pseudoscience shows on the History Channel like MonsterQuest to the careers of such enterprising vulgarians and spectaclemongers as D. W. Griffith, Jerry Bruckheimer and the creators of reality television.

Glenn Horowitz, a rare-book dealer who handled the auction for Mr. McCarthy, told The New York Times earlier this week: When I grasped that some of the most complex, almost otherworldly fiction of the postwar era was composed on such a simple, functional, frail-looking machine, it conferred a sort of talismanic quality to Cormacs typewriter. Its as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife. Mr. McCarthy will not be using the opportunity to go digital after all these years. A friend of his recently bought him a replacement typewriter  the same Olivetti model  for less than $20.",2009-12-05T00:57:54+0000

The Off Broadway environment is a very fragile one, Mr. Davenport said in a telephone interview. After two, three years, weve been watching every box office number we could. Weve just gotten to this point where its too risky to keep going. Altar Boyz, a satirical musical about a Christian pop band, above, had its premiere at the New York Musical Theater Festival in 2004 and transferred to New World Stages (then known as Dodger Stages) the next year. At its closing, it will have played 2,032 performances, Mr. Davenport said. Mr. Davenport, a former actor (Forever Plaid) who helped develop the musical with his fellow performer Marc Kessler, said Altar Boyz had pared expenses to keep the show open. In recent months, Mr. Davenport said, the show was running without a casting director or an outside advertising agency. Its a bleak winter, said Mr. Davenport, who is also a producer of Oleanna, which will close on Sunday.",2009-12-05T00:58:18+0000

us,"Art Basel Miami 2009 | After Performa, the Show Goes On","For the last year or so, we have seen a growing interest in performance art, which hasnt been so popular among art groupies since its golden days in the 1970s. Performance arts comeback follows other art-world trends like photography, a return to painting and the rise of the multimedia installation. And after reading the actor James Francos preaching in The Wall Street Journal about the history of performance art and presenting his 20-episode stunt in the soap opera General Hospital as an art piece, I cannot wait to see it going mainstream and worldwide.I am not sure what is driving this resurgence: is it a reaction against the excesses of the art market in previous years or an expression of its present crisis in 2009? Is it a form of rejection, an act against art consumption, a sign of fatigue over the art products now available in every fair and biennial in every corner of the world? We are so tired of the old paintings on the wall and of the edition-of-three garden sculptures. Dont we all want something unique and unrepeatable? Something that not only money can buy.

That was in 1988. Davis then put the footage away until a traveling museum retrospective made it clear that there was little of the actual Basquiat on film.

Thats why I suggested that were such a transformation likely or even plausible, it would merit the deepest sort of pessimism about Europes future.

As it turns out, the strain of the downturn hasnt pushed the divorce rate higher; instead, economic stress seems to have made American marriages slightly more stable overall, as couples develop a new appreciation for the economic and social support that marriage can provide in tough times, as the studys lead author, Brad Wilcox, puts it. Americans are also turning thriftier (saving more, cutting down on credit card debt, reviving home-based economies, etc.), which is good news for wedlock, since financial stability correlates with marital stability, and with marital happiness as well. If you squint a little at the data, you could even imagine that the recession, and the adjustments required by long periods of unemployment, might accelerate the social acceptance of women as equal breadwinners and men as capable parents and homemakers, as Christine Whalen writes in an accompanying essay, and make the institution of marriage more flexible and resilient in the long run.",2009-12-08T20:51:51+0000

us,Two Worlds Collide: Rock Royalty Meets Authentic Royalty,"Meanwhile, in Britain, a woman who is an object of fascination to her millions of loyal subjects and dogged by inquisitive followers wherever she goes was, at long last, introduced to Queen Elizabeth II. On Monday, Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, of the New York Germanottas, and better known as the pop star Lady Gaga, above right, with Queen Elizabeth II, was among the artists at the Royal Variety Performance, an annual benefit for Britains Entertainment Artistes Benevolent Fund. Agence France-Presse reported that Lady Gaga attended the event at Blackpools Opera House clad in a red PVC outfit and played her song Speechless on a piano supported by stilts. (Cribbing a line from John Lennon, she began her performance by telling the crowd: Good evening Blackpool. Let me hear you rattle your jewelry.) Other performers included Whoopi Goldberg, the comedian Frank Carson and the dance troupe Diversity. Miley Cyrus also performed, gyrating in leather hot pants onstage while singing her hit Party in the U.S.A., according to Agence France-Presse.",2009-12-08T22:15:55+0000
us,Ireland Gives New York $3.5. Million for Center,"Over the years Ireland has provided New York with cultural assets like Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne and that occasional visitor Bono. Now the Irish government has made a more numerically quantifiable contribution in the form of a $3.5 million grant that will be used to build a new Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. The announcement was made in Ireland by that countrys foreign minister, Micheal Martin, and confirmed by Christine C. Quinn, the New York City Council speaker. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Ms. Quinn said the new Irish Arts Center would probably be at the institutions current site, 553 West 51st Street in Clinton. The space hosts exhibitions and educational programs, and is also home to a 99-seat theater, but is not quite as green as it was at its founding in 1972. Its heart and soul is a total treasure, Ms. Quinn said. Its physical shape has not quite kept up. In addition to the contribution from the Irish government, the City of New York has committed $7.75 million in capital financing for the center, and additional contributions are expected from the federal government and private donors. A start date for construction was not announced.",2009-12-08T22:16:12+0000

Now, as the troubled airline reorganizes after bankruptcy, it is selling many works from that collection, including a few that racked up some serious miles. More than 180 paintings, drawings, prints and other works from the collection were to be auctioned Tuesday night in Rome by Finarte Casa DAste, the auction house announced on its Web site, finarte.it. The highlight of the sale, with a high estimate of about $660,000, is the Futurist painter Gino Severinis Zeus Gave Birth to the Sun, a colorfully geometric work on three panels that once hung in the airlines Paris offices.",2009-12-08T22:17:11+0000

To Miller, the success of a big, expensive ceramic chandelier makes total sense. A light is the first thing people notice when they walk into a room, he says, so you want it to say something, and youre willing to pay more for it. With that in mind, Miller has created an as-yet-unnamed lighting firm, with products set to make their debut at next springs furniture fair in New York. He will produce his own work and will cherry-pick the best of his colleagues, like Paul Loebachs triangulated aluminum Himmeli lights or Sarah Cihat and Michael Millers rocker-chic porcelain-and-chain lamps.

With Alice, I could be my mad self, but in the context of Tim Burtons Alice, my madness actually seemed rather tame.

The layout was very simple, almost monastic, with clusters of tables aligned with the portholes, said the architect Andre Kikoski, who designed the restaurant. But, as he explained, it wasnt conducive to social interaction, and it certainly wasnt about the integration of art. Rather than executing Wrights original sketches, Kikoski turned the space  most recently a generic cafeteria with brown carpeting  into a modern homage to the legendary architect, who designed the museum to harmonize with the artwork within.

The guides arent especially comprehensive or surprising (and, honestly, who traipses around Tokyo with a hardcover in his pocket?), but theyre nonetheless beautifully produced enough for some dreamy armchair travel. What you actually might want in your pocket as you roam a foreign land is a Fabriano notepad. The Bouquet set includes seven booklets, each with a different type of paper  parchment, vellum, embossed  suitable for, say, tracing a gargoyle at Pre Lachaise or jotting down first impressions of the Forbidden City. (Remembering a trip through a travel diary can be just as rewarding as browsing old photographs). To keep all your itineraries in order, theres the new diary set from Moleskine, with a different color soft-cover booklet for each month. It contains plenty of stickers and numbers and ledgers for a total taxonomical orgy, and it all tucks snugly into a black binder that snaps shut with the companys usual elastic band. The Tumi set is $125 at Tumi stores and tumi.com; Fabrianos Bouquet is about $17 at Binders; and the Moleskine set is $40 at barnesandnoble.com.",2009-12-10T09:55:41+0000

Yet compared with the reputations of other members of that august pantheon, Wilsons lags far behind. George W. Bush was described as Wilsonian after 9/11, but that was hardly meant as a compliment. Barack Obama, like Wilson a scholar, political neophyte and Nobel Peace Prize winner, prefers to be compared to Lincoln and the second Roosevelt, or even to Truman and Reagan  practically any other member of the top ranks. Today, the only major public figure who seems to be interested in Wilson is the Fox News host Glenn Beck, who traces the roots of our current socialist predicament back to the dark era of Wilsonian income taxes, war propaganda and obscure monetary symbols.

The objects, which come from 27 regions of the country, range from clothing and accessories to housewares and furniture. There are items  like traditional lacquerware and fierce-looking kitchen knives  that are identifiably Japanese. But others are harder to pin down. SatsumaVidro offers delectable, expensive cut crystal and colored glass that was influenced by English and European techniques. Kawaguchi I-mono cast iron cooking pots are strong but amazingly lightweight. Bitowas contemporary lacquer, like the Raku box shown below below, puts a modern twist on a time-honored craft.

us,Now Tippling | Londons Leading Microbrew,"As young men in 1980s London, Alistair Hook and Ben Joseph played in punk bands, chased girls and drank a lot of beer. They started brewing their own in Hooks small flat in the citys Greenwich neighborhood and, after developing a taste for artisanal brews, they officially introduced Meantime Brewing and opened their first brewery and pub, the Greenwich Union, in 2001. More than a dozen types of beer later  including pilsners, stouts, wheats, flavored brews and a yearly roster of limited-edition releases  Meantime has become the only real beer success story to come out of London in a very long time. Hook says he started Meantime not only because he loved beer, but also because of what he considered to be Londons appalling British beer scene. Artisanal beers produced in Britain are predominantly D.I.Y. one-man shows, brewed in houses or garages or small pubs, and mostly in the bread-basket regions of Kent and Sussex. There is no microbrew movement here; indeed, eight out of 10 beers consumed in the city come from foreign companies, like Anheuser-Busch, Heineken and SABMiller. They taste of nothing, says Hook, referring to the pasteurization process of mass-produced beer, which wipes out the carefully cultivated flavors that American microbreweries are famous for.Meantimes efforts arent appreciated by everyone. The company is often castigated by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), a British organization dedicated to preserving Britains historical brewing standards. By definition, British Real Ale is fermented in the vessel its consumed from, whereas Meantimes beers are brewed and fermented slowly in giant steel tanks. CAMRA maintains that Meantime Brewing is quintessentially un-British.That may be one reason that the United States is Meantimes largest export market, selling to pubs and shops in 29 states. (You can find a full list on the Web site.) But the company is certainly gaining ground at home. Having since moved their headquarters to the crusty Docklands warehouse district in south London, the men of Meantime will open their second pub and brewing lab in March. The Old Brewery will occupy a site that, 300 years ago, was home to the Royal Naval Hospitals brewery, an operation set up to provide veterans and war pensioners with their daily pint. Records show that Londoners have been brewing beer on the same site since the time of Henry VIII.Until then, look out for the release this month of Meantimes last seasonal lager for the year, a smocked bock brewed in the Franconian style  meaning the Munich malts used in the recipe are smoked. Hook says the beer tastes like Christmas in a bottle, with notes of ham, smoked cheese and other hearty foods found at the table this time of year. You may have to look hard for it, though. Hook is unconcerned with meeting quotas or filling orders ahead of his competition. Were not always on schedule with our beer deliveries, he says, but then we dont rush the fermentation process. We want the flavors in our beers to reach full potential. After all, whats in a name is what its all about.",2009-12-11T20:45:44+0000

The earlier ruling struck a blow to Gov. Beverly Perdue, a Democrat who has fought the release of nearly two dozen inmates demanding release under the law. The inmates argued that state law further reduced the 80-year sentences by half or more for good behavior. The case has infuriated Democrats and Republicans across the tough-on-crime state, but prisoner advocates say the inmates have lawfully earned their freedom. The law defining a life sentence as 80 years was changed in 1977 and applies only to people convicted from 1974 to 1978. ",2009-12-15T01:56:45+0000

us,Footes Orphans Could See Broadway,"Signature Theater Company and the producers Jeffrey Richards and Daryl Roth are discussing a possible transfer of the Signature production of Horton Footes last play, The Orphans Home Cycle, to Broadway in April after its Off Broadway run, said three people involved in the production. Mr. Richards, one of Broadways busiest producers, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday afternoon that he was certainly interested in the possible transfer of Orphans, a three-part, nine-hour play based on the lives of Footes parents and relatives in Texas in the early 1900s. I think its a great piece of theater, he said. Of a possible transfer, he added, Other people are looking at it too. The three people involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the transfer discussion was meant to be private, said the talks involving Mr. Richards and Ms. Roth  who produced Irenas Vow on Broadway last season and many other plays  accelerated after the exuberant reviews for Part 1 of the cycle last month. The talks have reached a serious stage, but no commitments had been made, these people said. The idea is to transfer and open the production in time to be eligible for the Tony Awards this June.",2009-12-15T23:33:58+0000
us,Writers Guild Disputes Random House on E-Rights,"The Authors Guild, a trade group that represents writers, posted a statement on its Web site (authorsguild.org) on Tuesday disputing efforts by Random House to claim e-book rights to titles published before 1994. On Friday, Random House sent a letter to dozens of literary agents saying that the vast majority of our backlist contracts grant us the exclusive right to publish books in electronic formats. But in its Web site statement, the guild, which has more than 8,000 members, noted that Random House changed its contracts with authors in 1994 explicitly to include electronic book rights. Random House felt the need to change its contract, quite plainly, because its authors did not grant those rights to it under Random Houses standard contracts prior to 1994, the guild wrote. The statement continued: Publishers acquire only the rights that they bargain for; authors retain rights they have not expressly granted to publishers. E-book rights, under older book contracts, were retained by the authors.  Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said in a statement that the company respectfully disagrees with the Authors Guild and that it believed rights for its backlist were ours to maximize.",2009-12-15T23:34:17+0000

My own take is that religion has often been part of the problem, but that it also can be part of the solution. Ive seen people kill in the name of religion, and Ive seen people reject condoms in the name of religion even as a tool for fighting AIDS (which usually means people dying). But Ive also seen Catholic nuns showing unbelievable courage and compassion in corners of the world where no other aid workers are around, and mission clinics and church-financed schools too numerous to mention. And in Islamic countries, Ive seen mullahs who are hypocritical misogynists but also some imams who are leading a push for education and justice. In short, I dont think theres any glib answer to the question, but there is no question that religions can be a force for justice and equality that they are now not.

That hundreds of thousands refers to the number of Americans who die every decade because they dont have health insurance  or rather, it refers to one studys estimate of that number.

When confronted by the possibility of donating her brain-injured daughters organs after the accident, Beaulieu never doubted that Amanda would have wanted them to go to someone who needed them. But Amanda first had to be declared dead, and in her case, the only way that could happen was if her parents chose a precisely choreographed death  one conducted by medical personnel in a hospital procedure meant to allow Amanda to die while preserving her organs.

In the feminine version of the genre, the heroines typically possess awesome powers of desirability. In Harrisons spin, the male leads arent much to look at (usually), yet they possess awesome powers of desire. Whether a whippersnapper of 12 or a geezer rancher in his 70s, the Harrison hero unfailingly sparks the ardor of any girl or woman he encounters, even when hes sick, drunk and drugged, having his teeth pulled, passing kidney stones or dying. He doesnt mind if a woman is a few decades older than he is or half a century younger; whether shes a king-size Lakota divorce pushing 60 or a miniature young nurse with a boyfriend.

In The Twilight Years, his thought-provoking and illuminating new study of the interwar period, Richard Overy contends that before 1914 the British believed they had conquered the world and would rule it forever. After World War I, a wrecked generation had to pick up the pieces of that world and ask what went wrong. It is this process that occupies the book, which successfully adopts a broad-brush approach to cultural life without obscuring gemlike details.

The apartment did not hold the cachet of top-of-the-stairs living. You needed only to ascend a few steps to the scarred brown door labeled 2B. The latch was faulty, and because the sublet was illegal and I was too broke to call a locksmith, I lived with the door that would not lock. The odds were low that out of all the apartments in all of the old tenements in the city, someone would try doorknobs then risk prison time to steal a clutch of clothing and books from mine.

us,Wallcoverings Without the Middleman,"Not long ago, on a visit to the D&D Building, Cindy Weil discovered how hard it can be to buy high-end wallpaper from showrooms that sell only to designers. So Ms. Weil, an e-commerce veteran (she was previously a director in the Internet group at Ameritrade), started The Wallpaper Collective, a Web site that sells wallcoverings directly to the consumer. Its frustrating  and expensive  to buy wallpaper through the trade, she said. I wanted to take the hassle out of it. The site carries the work of 15 designers, over 100 patterns in all, some of them contemporary versions of traditional toile and trellis designs. (Rose Orange, top left, and Poppy Red, below it, by Camilla Meijer, are $420 for a 49-square-foot roll.) Ms. Weil offers what she calls artisanal wallpaper, which originated as hand-painted or blocked patterns by tiny studios and is produced in small print runs. And she makes it a practice to send customers samples, so they can see patterns firsthand. Information: (212) 966-3958 or wallpapercollective.com. ",2009-12-17T01:09:48+0000

The 47-year-old artist, the child of a leftist mural painter and teacher, studied in Mexico City and is the subject of a career retrospective at MoMA that runs through March 1. Part of Mr. Orozcos initial appeal was his approach to art. Dodging commitments to mediums or styles, he took improvisation as his baseline method, and turned personal quirks into assets, writes Holland Cotter. Although the shock and delight of puzzlement, of seeing nothing turn into something before your eyes, from the first show are gone, there are still treasures to be found in this exhibition, including dozens of small sculptures set out on shelves and tables in the last gallery. Some are sketchy or merely busy, but others do what Mr. Orozco has always done best: find the cosmic in the commonplace, sweeten abjection with wisdom and wit.",2009-12-17T02:09:04+0000

Those looking for added impetus to watch the New Mexico Bowl  as if you needed it  can look toward a matchup of second-level teams from the Western Athletic and Mountain West conferences as a potential litmus test for Januarys Fiesta Bowl, which pits the respective champions (Boise State and Texas Christian) of each conference. However, unlike the Fiesta, this bowl has a decided favorite. Before handing the cherished New Mexico Bowl title to Fresno State, however, take note: the Bulldogs entered this same bowl game last season as sizable favorites, but fell to a hungry Colorado State team (also from the Mountain West, like Wyoming) that preached the same ball-control, turnover-free offense the Cowboys have used to reach six wins.",2009-12-19T20:57:00+0000

Chait argues that the Republicans could have sold moderate Democrats on a vastly more limited piece of legislation, if theyd been willing to compromise early in the process. Instead, by uniting in lockstep opposition and gambling that the difficulties of getting to sixty would doom the Democratic effort, the G.O.P. has ensured that theyll walk away with nothing. Frum, meanwhile, suggests that Republicans placed too much rhetorical emphasis on the freedom of healthcare providers to do business in their own way, free of government interference, and not enough emphasis on holding the line on costs. By fearmongering about death panels and attacking Medicare cuts, he argues, the G.O.P. riled up its ideological base but failed to rally the institutional supporters of the Republican party, the taxpayers, small business owners and corporate leaders who care about cost control.

us,"After Actress Dies, SNL Skit Disappears","A Saturday Night Live sketch that satirized the actress Brittany Murphy, below, has been pulled from Internet sites like hulu.com, provoking disagreements among viewers about whether the video should remain on the Web, and whether SNL should have performed the skit at all. In a segment that appeared on the Dec. 5 episode of the show, Seth Meyers, anchor of the mock news segment Weekend Update and its head writer, noted reports that Ms. Murphy had recently been fired from a film project called The Caller. He was soon joined at the Weekend Update desk by his cast mate Abby Elliott, who was impersonating Ms. Murphy. The fictional Ms. Murphy seemed to be disoriented and still under the impression that she was on an episode that Ms. Murphy hosted in 2002. Though video of the sketch was posted on hulu.com soon after the show was broadcast, it disappeared from the site after Ms. Murphy died on Sunday. A news media representative for Saturday Night Live declined to comment. The Los Angeles County coroner has said that an official cause of Ms. Murphys death might not be determined for some time.",2009-12-21T23:59:14+0000
us,Avatar Opening Grosses: The Sequels," It seems that 20th Century Fox got a bit carried away as it counted final Avatar grosses. On Sunday Fox said that this 3-D science-fiction epic directed by James Cameron had made $73 million in its debut weekend. But that figure was based on studio estimates of Sunday ticket sales. Early on Monday, after Sunday sales figures were available, Chris Aronson, Foxs senior vice president for domestic distribution, said Avatar had actually raked in $77.3 million in North America over the weekend. That meant that it had beaten Will Smiths I Am Legend, which opened in 2007 at $77.2 million and holds the record for a December opening. Then, a couple of hours later, Fox was forced to try to pick up the confetti, saying the final total for Avatar was actually $76.8 million, below the record for Legend. And soon thereafter came yet another correction: the final number  Fox promised  was actually $77,025,481. BROOKS BARNES",2009-12-21T23:59:41+0000

Luckily, the colonial town  which dates back to the 16th century and still bears traces of Spanish, Creole and Native American cultures  was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 2008.

He never mentions the unmissable monument, the six-story octagonal Baptistery of pink-and-cream Verona marble, built at the beginning of the 13th century, one of the worlds most elegant medieval buildings.

But the Russian ruling did not appear to have any immediate practical effect on the case against Mr. Khodorkovsky or his partner, Platon Lebedev. Both have been serving eight-year prison terms after being convicted in a tax-fraud case and are now on trial on new charges. Their supporters say they became targets of prosecutors because Mr. Khodorkovsky, at the time Russias richest man, ventured into politics and challenged Vladimir V. Putin, then the president and now the prime minister. Mr. Lebedev had appealed his case to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2007 that his rights had been violated when he was arrested. But the Russian court did not adopt the European ruling until now, and it did not order any change in Mr. Lebedevs status. Defense lawyers said that beyond the symbolism of the decision, they did not expect any significant impact on the case in the near future. ",2009-12-24T02:53:43+0000

Lost amid this mix is Nevada, fresh off a second-place finish in the WAC (behind, of course, Boise State). Nevada should have its way with S.M.U., especially on the ground, as the nations top ground game faces off against the nations 88th-ranked rush defense.

Or at least this Mick Wall does, this fellow from England who has also written or co-written definitive biographies of Ozzy, Bono and Iron Maiden. The back story is like this: A hot session guitarist named Jimmy Page kills some time in a band called the Yardbirds (Shapes of Things, etc.) until he decides he can do better by assembling the New Yardbirds  except that he is unable to lure away the Whos rhythm section, which he devoutly wishes to steal, or Steve Marriott of Small Faces, a singer of note. He settles instead for a couple of country yokels, Robert Plant and John Bonham, vocals and drums respectively, and another somewhat frustrated session dude, John Paul Jones, who plays the bass. Of these, Page is most happy about Bonham, who hits the drums as if he is trying to affect seismic activity in the British Isles. About the singer, who is very good looking, hes not sure. Page doesnt pay much attention to the bass player at all. ",2009-12-24T16:51:37+0000

The commenter donbo2010 nominated Stings I Saw Three Ships. (This appalling, calypso, drumming mess truly makes my ears bleed at every listen.) And many readers were troubled by I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, like Rose, who wrote, How do you explain to a child that this particular Mommie was having/not having an extramarital affair with another man? But there was one yuletide tune that took a commanding lead early on and never looked back. And the winner is Wonderful Christmastime, by Paul McCartney. The commenter kevg may have made the best case for its inclusion, writing, It proves that even a Beatle can go horribly wrong.

Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, hired the sign maker Artkraft Strauss to build  then lower  a 700-pound wood-and-iron ball, five feet in diameter and illuminated by 100 25-watt bulbs, to mark the passage from 1907 to 1908. The ball descended slowly from a flagpole atop One Times Square, at the intersection of Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street, where thousands witness it live  and millions more on television  each New Years Eve. The ritual echoes one that has taken place since 1833 at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, where a ball is lowered daily at 1 p.m., originally to help ship captains nearby synchronize their chronometers. Beginning in 1845, there was also a ball dropped each noon at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington so inhabitants could reset their timepieces; it was eventually replaced by more advanced methods including todays master clock system, which automatically resets using an atomic clock.

That dubious distinction belonged to the J. J. Abrams-directed reboot of Star Trek, featuring Zachary Quinto as a young Spock, which topped a list of disparate films compiled by the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks the file-sharing program BitTorrent. According to that list, Star Trek was downloaded close to 11 million times, and other guy-oriented blockbusters dominated the chart: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was No. 2, with 10.6 million downloads; The Hangover was No. 4, with 9.2 million downloads; Wolverine was No. 9, with 7.2 million downloads. But there was no accounting for pirates tastes, and no clear correlation between piracy and the overall box office revenues of these movies. The years No. 3 was the Guy Ritchie misfire RocknRolla, which earned less than $26 million worldwide since its 2008 release but was downloaded more than 9.4 million times; the No. 5 slot went to the first installment of Twilight, which took in nearly $385 million globally and was downloaded more than 8.7 million times.",2009-12-25T22:21:11+0000

Ohio has fulfilled those expectations  and then some  thanks to another sterling coaching job by Frank Solich, who molded a statistically average team into the MAC East champion. Marshall, like Ohio, fulfilled its preseason hopes by reaching bowl play; thats where the similarities end. The Thundering Herd enter the Little Caesars Bowl running on empty, having fired their coach following losses in four of their last six games.

This mentality paid enormous dividends for Pittsburgh through the seasons first 10 games, with three wins in a five-game span coming by single digits. (Unfortunately, Pittsburgh also happened to lose ugly. The Panthers had their hearts broken by last-minute losses to West Virginia and Cincinnati to end the season.) This trend continues with the Tar Heels, winners of four straight from Oct. 29 to Nov. 21, who were dealt a humiliating loss to rival N.C. State to end the season.

The rationale behind Boston Colleges lack of preseason hype was simple: Jeff Jagodzinski was gone, let go following the season and replaced by the longtime B.C. assistant Frank Spaziani; the all-American linebacker Mark Herzlich, diagnosed with cancer, sat out the season; and the projected starting quarterback, academically ineligible, transferred. Despite the travails, B.C. has extended its streak of eight-win seasons to nine, with the potential for a sixth straight nine-win campaign with a victory Saturday. What about those Trojans?

We tend to hide these things from view; Ancient Industries aims to change that.The American-born Wilson grew up in Europe in the 1970s. With her aesthetics-and-quality-obsessed mother in charge, the family bought only traditionally made, well-designed and modest clothing and home items. When Wilson moved back to the United States, her penchant for quality and tradition led her to continue the pilgrimages of her youth to the markets of Europe, where items made by the ancient industries, like Austrian enamelware makers and Menorcan cobblers, still existed. When requests for her continental finds outnumbered the bags she wanted to carry home, she started selling these wares to her friends, then friends of friends, through trunk shows. In August, three years after establishing her business, Wilson set up an e-commerce Web site, and now we can all buy the perfect hot water bottle or enameled milk pot.

In an article in the January issue of The Art Newspaper, Mr. Bailey wrote that he had devised the theory after studying van Goghs painting Still Life: Drawing Board With Onions, which the artist completed a month after cutting off part of his left earlobe. Among the details in the painting is an envelope, an image that Mr. Bailey examined under a microscope and said contained a letter in which Theo revealed he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend. Vincent was fearful that he might lose his brothers emotional and financial support, leading to his self-mutilation, Mr. Bailey wrote. Historically, van Goghs ear cutting has been attributed to everything from his mental illness to his lead paints to a fight with his fellow painter Paul Gauguin.",2009-12-28T21:56:15+0000

The move came Monday, days after the two countries agreed to reopen a major border crossing, another sign that some aspects of the chill might be easing. Russia is home to a huge Georgian diaspora, and charter planes used to travel between the capitals three times a day during the holiday season. The flights were suspended in 2006 in retaliation for Georgias arrests of four Russian military officers on espionage charges. The flights resumed in March 2008, but stopped again five months later, when the two countries went to war over the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia. ",2009-12-29T01:33:30+0000

But on Monday, the Kadima parliamentary delegation voted to reject the offer. Kadima leaders said it had not been serious and was part of Mr. Netanyahus effort to destroy their party, his main opposition. After the rejection was announced, Ms. Livni, above, attacked Mr. Netanyahu, saying, The cynical use of threats in order to appear to be calling for an emergency government  and bring in parts of Kadima  is not an act worthy of a prime minister.

(6-6) vs. Temple (9-3),"U.C.L.A. has backed into bowl play like no other, earning a trip to the EagleBank Bowl only after Armys loss to Navy to end the regular season left the Black Knights a win away from bowl eligibility. The Bruins will take the bid, and do so happily, especially when considering last seasons brutal offensive showing and the youth of this years roster. Whether U.C.L.A. fans will make the trip cross country to frigid Washington, D.C., remains to be seen. (I would bet on a light showing.) While U.C.L.A. Coach Rick Neuheisel is still experiencing some growing pains in leading the Bruins back into the national picture, Temples rebirth is officially complete. Coach Al Golden, in his fourth year, has taken the Owls from 1-11 in 2006 to 9-3 this fall, and within one victory of playing for a Mid-American Conference championship.

Created in 1937 and in circulation until 1971, Look had a little bit of everything: fashion, celebrity, crime, human interest. The book and show draw from the museums trove of about 200,000 images from Look, donated by Cowles Magazines, beginning in the 1950s. Many other images never made it into the pages of Look, which ran more like a photo agency than a magazine.

The Champagnes green status comes from an innovation Gasco refers to as sexual confusion.

Theyre also using 20 percent less water to produce the Champagne and have cut their pesticide use by a quarter. Pommery is bottling the bubbly in a lightweight glass container, with no external packaging and a label printed with water-soluble ink, and its shipping the cases to the States by boat. The $55 POP Earth has just debuted at Sherry Lehmann in New York and in a handful of stores in Florida, Texas and California; it will be widely available in 2010. ",2009-12-29T16:39:03+0000

The decision comes as a bit of a surprise given that Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special, a performance shown on Comedy Central in 2008, is that channels most-viewed broadcast ever, drawing 6.6 million viewers, and that the premiere of The Jeff Dunham Show was watched by 5.3 million viewers. (Ratings for subsequent episodes declined to under two million viewers.) Comedy Central said it would continue to work with Mr. Dunham on a larger deal it signed with him this year, which includes a live tour, a standup special, DVDs and other products.",2009-12-29T23:22:43+0000

The Borough of Seaside Heights, N.J., has joined the list of organizations, institutions  and now, municipalities  to raise objections to that hit MTV reality series, The Associated Press reported. In a statement, the government of Seaside Heights, where the first season of Jersey Shore was taped over the summer, said it did not solicit, promote or participate in the filming of this show. It added that though Seaside Heights gave filming permits to the production company that filmed Jersey Shore, it does not condone any discriminatory remarks against Italian-Americans, domestic violence or the promiscuous and otherwise bad behavior portrayed on the show. The statement continued: The people on the show are certainly not indicative of the majority of those who visit, and enjoy the Jersey Shore and Seaside Heights every summer. Since its debut in November, Jersey Shore has been protested by the New Jersey Italian American Legislative Caucus, Unico National, the Order of the Sons of Italy in America and the National Italian-American Foundation, as well as the Jersey Shore Convention and Visitors Bureau. MTV has said that the show depicts just one aspect of youth culture and is not intended to stereotype, discriminate or offend.",2009-12-29T23:23:03+0000

Reuters reported that the Weinstein Company is scaling back its release plans for Nine, Rob Marshalls adaptation of the Broadway musical, after it met with poor reviews and low box office grosses. Though Nine was showing on about 1,400 screens last weekend, it grossed just $5.5 million and will play on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. The movie is performing very well on about 890 key screens, David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, told Reuters. In a review of Nine in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that as it strains to capture artistic frenzy, it descends into vulgar chaos and is less a homage to Federico Fellinis 8  (its putative inspiration) than a travesty. Nine was nonetheless nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, including best motion picture (comedy or musical).",2009-12-30T17:26:47+0000

Its not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade in Methuens Second Grammar School in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, according to The Boston Globe, and theyre applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frosts hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didnt. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadnt even finished his first semester. But teachers didnt need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. In fact, teaching was the Frost family business. Frosts father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frosts mother, also a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, got hired there, too.

us,Listening to Braille," AT 4 OCLOCK each morning, Laura J. Sloate begins her daily reading. She calls a phone service that reads newspapers aloud in a synthetic voice, and she listens to The Wall Street Journal at 300 words a minute, which is nearly twice the average pace of speech. Later, an assistant reads The Financial Times to her while she uses her computers text-to-speech system to play The Economist aloud. She devotes one ear to the paper and the other to the magazine. The managing director of a Wall Street investment management firm, Sloate has been blind since age 6, and although she reads constantly, poring over the news and the economic reports for several hours every morning, she does not use Braille. Knowledge goes from my ears to my brain, not from my finger to my brain, she says. As a child she learned how the letters of the alphabet sounded, not how they appeared or felt on the page. She doesnt think of a comma in terms of its written form but rather as a stop on the way before continuing. This, she says, is the future of reading for the blind. Literacy evolves, she told me. When Braille was invented, in the 19th century, we had nothing else. We didnt even have radio. At that time, blindness was a disability.

Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington clich that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the 40s.

And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

The movie that brought Kurosawa  and Japanese cinema as a whole  to the attention of the world, Rashomon (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: The Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), Yojimbo (1961), Sanjuro (1962) and Ran (1985).

Lousy,"Broadway is once again having a tough winter: the critically acclaimed revival of the musical Finians Rainbow will close on Jan. 17 after 22 preview and 92 regular performances. In a statement on Wednesday the producers blamed the economic realities of Broadway today for the quick end. A spokesman said the lead producers were unavailable for an interview about whether the show amounted to a total loss for investors. In recent weeks productions of the musicals Burn the Floor, Bye Bye Birdie, Ragtime and Shrek and the plays Oleanna and Superior Donuts closed or announced the end of their Broadway runs because of weak or unpredictable ticket sales. A pair of productions, Brighton Beach Memoirs and Broadway Bound, were also quickly canceled in late October because of poor sales. These financial disappointments come as Broadways overall box office has been strong this season, thanks to star-driven shows (A Steady Rain) and blockbusters like Wicked. Some shows close virtually every January, the start of a post-holiday slowdown, but the 2009-10 failed crop is fairly large.

us,How Are Things in Glocca Morra? Lousy,"Broadway is once again having a tough winter: the critically acclaimed revival of the musical Finians Rainbow will close on Jan. 17 after 22 preview and 92 regular performances. (Above, from left, Paige Simunovich, Christopher Fitzgerald and Christopher Borger in the show.) In a statement on Wednesday the producers blamed the economic realities of Broadway today for the quick end. A spokesman said the lead producers were unavailable for an interview about whether the show amounted to a total loss for investors. In recent weeks productions of the musicals Burn the Floor, Bye Bye Birdie, Ragtime and Shrek and the plays Oleanna and Superior Donuts closed or announced the end of their Broadway runs because of weak or unpredictable ticket sales. A pair of productions, Brighton Beach Memoirs and Broadway Bound, were also quickly canceled in late October because of poor sales. These financial disappointments come as Broadways overall box office has been strong this season, thanks to star-driven shows (A Steady Rain) and blockbusters like Wicked. Some shows close virtually every January, the start of a post-holiday slowdown, but the 2009-10 failed crop is fairly large. Other shows also closing soon, like Wishful Drinking, were scheduled as limited engagements.",2009-12-31T07:57:57+0000

Whatever Booth intended, the cartoon is not without a certain art historical truth, if Roberto Calasso is on the mark. According to him, Tiepolo (1696-1770) was a master of sprezzatura, a virtue much prized in the Renaissance courtier. The word has no exact equivalent in English, but it refers to a kind of nonchalance regarding ones endowments, in art and in life, so that one just might be a great painter without anyone knowing one could paint. Sprezzatura is discussed by Baldassare Castiglione in The Book of the Courtier  a guide to courtly conduct.

According to the police The Chorus, above, a small colorful pastel depicting singers on a stage, worth an estimated $1.15 million, was stolen overnight from the Cantini Museum. A security guard noticed that it was missing early Thursday morning. Jacques Dallest, a prosecutor, said the artwork appeared to have been unscrewed from the wall, adding, As far as I know there was no break-in.

us,Crime Pays for CBS,"With virtually nothing but repeats on network television in prime time on the final Wednesday of 2009, CBSs Criminal Minds and CSI: NY easily dominated the night. According to Nielsens estimates, the two crime shows won their respective time slots with 11 million and 10.9 million viewers, respectively, at 9 and 10 p.m. No other programs came close to matching those numbers, including CBSs comedy reruns at 8 and 8:30, The New Adventures of Old Christine (6 million) and Gary Unmarried (5.6 million). ABC was a distant second, earning its best ratings at 8 with its holiday special, Happy New Year, Charlie Brown (5.2 million). Following it ABCs comedy reruns each delivered under 4.5 million viewers, and at 10 a new episode of Eastwick (3.3 million), the lone nonrerun on the night, lagged behind NBCs repeat of The Jay Leno Show (4.4 million) in the hour. NBC finished in third place for the night, while Fox ranked fourth.",2009-12-31T21:24:32+0000
us,My American Friends,"The first thing I ever heard about Americans was that they all carried guns. Then, when I came across people whod had direct contact with this ferocious-sounding tribe, I learned that they were actually rather friendly. At university, friends who had traveled in the United States came back with more detailed stories, not just of the friendliness of Americans but also of their hospitality (which, in our quaint English way, was translated into something close to gullibility). When I finally got to America myself, I found that not only were the natives friendly and hospitable, they were also incredibly polite. No one tells you this about Americans, but once you notice it, it becomes one of their defining characteristics, especially when theyre abroad. ",2009-12-31T21:24:39+0000
us,Nine Is Staying Put,"After a report that the Weinstein Company was scaling back its release of Nine, the studio says it has no plans to pull the movie out of some theaters, Reuters reported. Last weekend the Federico Fellini-inspired musical with a star-studded cast was showing on 1,412 screens in the United States. This week David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, said it was performing well on 890 screens, and Reuters reported that it would be shown on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. On Wednesday Mr. Glasser said, At this moment in time there has been no plan between us nor the theater chains that we deal with to cut any theaters. Nine opened in limited release on Dec. 18 in the United States and expanded to wide release on Dec. 25. The film, which received generally poor reviews from critics, cost an estimated $64 million to produce and finished eighth at the North American box office on its second week last weekend with a modest $5.5 million in ticket sales.",2009-12-31T21:24:54+0000

Its not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade at the Second Grammar School in Methuen in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, The Boston Globe reported, and theyre applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frosts hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didnt. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadnt even finished his first semester. But teachers didnt need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. Teaching was the family business. Frosts father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frosts mother, who had been a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and, not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, was hired there too.",2009-12-31T21:25:18+0000

us,Van Morrison Denies Report of a New Baby,"An announcement this week that Van Morrison, 64, had become a father again was a hoax posted by hackers on his Web site, according to a statement issued on Thursday in Mr. Morrisons name and reported by Agence France-Presse. The initial announcement on his official Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that the singer was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III. It added that the baby was the the spitting image of his daddy and was a dual citizen of Britain and the United States. On Thursday, a statement issued on Mr. Morrisons behalf by the public relations company Fleishman-Hillard International said the reports were completely and utterly without foundation, and that he had asked his management to carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my Web site on December 29th last. The original announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager. But an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, John Saunders, said in an interview with the Irish state radio network that the singer had told him that the story was completely false, and that he had not heard of Gigi Lee. Mr. Morrisons statement added, For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison, with whom I have two wonderful children.",2009-12-31T21:28:31+0000

Perhaps more impressive has been Missouris eight-win campaign, which came despite the general perception that the Tigers would struggle mightily attempting to replace players like quarterback Chase Daniel and receiver Jeremy Maclin.

However, CGI is used in this instance only because of both the running time of the commercial and the distance the entire ad would need to reach its conclusion; the ad agency, Wieden & Kennedy, couldnt find a studio large enough to accommodate the length of the ad, so the same space was used twice.
