She asked how to get rid of them. Here are some ideas. Albert Glantz, a Brooklyn reader scared them away by swishing a broom at pigeons several times each morning the appeared. The desirable birds cooperated by screeching at the pigeons. So far, it's worked. Charles Cocuzza, a Queens reader, suggests pigeons are attracted if the feed is easily accessible while the more desirable species will adapt to small eating quarters. He suggests putting up a number smaller bird feeders suited to the desirable species and not attractive to the heavybodied pigeons. Bernard Levitan, a Westchester County reader, has used an electrical shock devise, similar to electric fence, to keep unwanted birds from his feeder.

Museums were alleged to be indifferent, if not actually hostile, to the interests of the public, and mainly concerned with the judgment of (as one speaker put it) eternity. In session after session, day after day for the better part of a week, one speaker after another came forward to uphold what he felt to be the public interest, and was vigorously applauded for saying something nasty about the museum as citadel of privilege and elitism. The public interest was almost universally perceived by the speakers as existing in an adversary relationship to the traditional practices of museums, and the call for reform verged at times on the demagogic.",1975-07-06T05:00:00+0000

As will shortly appear, I do not by any means invariably agree with her, but Vendler is undoubtedly a finely trained and extraordinarily resourceful reader, and I cannot imagine that anybody who cares for Herbert, or more generally for poetry, will fail to learn something from this book. Her meditations are nearly always faithful to their textsshe very rarely succumbs to the vice of the close reader, which is to speak more wonders than the poem he is considering; and she has brought off a quite notable feat of construction in making a collection of disparate commentaries stand up as a book. I read it virtually straight through with Canon Hutchinson's edition open beside it, on an eighthour plane trip, unseduced by inflight movies or alcohol.

us,"'World's Young Ballet,' '69 Competition","""The World's Young Ballet,"" the Russian documentary that opened at the Bijou yesterday, is a vivid, if black-and-white, illustration of artistry that ignores geographical boundaries. Although this record of the 1969 ballet competition in Moscow's Bolshoi Theater that drew entries from 20 countries is fragmentary, it projects striking impressions of the talent of potential heirs to the golden slippers of even the likes of Rudolf Nureyev and Dame Margot Fonteyn.If they haven't reached the magnitude of such stars, some appear to be on their way. Mikhail Baryshnikov, who, of course, has since defected and is now with the American Ballet Theater, is eye-catching as a dancer and actor in his award-winning performance in ""Vestris."" And Japan's Fukagawa seems to be his strong competitor in fluid leaps and turns.While there is a mere glimpse of Helgi Tomasson, the American entrant now with the New York City Ballet, the film's international cast is ably represented. Ludmila Semenyaka, a petite ballerina from Leningrad, shows versatility in a gold-medal stint in both ""Giselle"" and in ""We,"" a charming pas de deux in modern, jazz style. France's Francesca Zumbo and Patrice Bart combine difficult Indian, modern and classical idioms in Maurice Bejart's ""Bakti."" And Cuba's Loipa Araujo and her Russian partner, Azari Pliset-sky, delicately glide through the classic, if standard, ""Swan Lake"" pas de deux.If the long parade of dancers is a mite confusing, Boris Lvov-Anokhin's American-accented narration is helpful. And a viewer is given some offstage peeks at rehearsals, at the judges including the famed retired prima ballerina Galina Ulanova and such activities as anxious competitors in the wings and a tour of Leningrad's ballet school.This ""Ballet"" is, of course, largely for special tastes. But even if Arkadi Tsineman's direction is somewhat disjointed and weighted in favor of the Soviet contingent, his documentation, even in excerpts, is captivating proof of the worldwide wealth of dedicated dancers.",1975-07-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'Shoot It' and 'Super Spook' Open,"As disparate approaches to seriousness and clownish crime and punishment, respectively, ""Shoot It: Black Shoot It: Blue"" and ""Super Spook,"" the double bill that arrived at local houses yesterday, rate high for their cooperative, independent efforts. But if the good intentions of both troupes are obvious, the results are varying disappointments.Call ""Super Spook"" a good deal less than persuasive as comedy or a lampoon of the black private-eye movie. Filmed in Harlem by a black team headed by Anthony Major, director, these antics are slavishly dedicated to the crack, ""If 'Shaft' can't, 'Hammer' won't, the 'Spook' will,"" delivered by Leonard Jackson, as its fumbling, titular sleuth. He's a good-natured buffoon, as are the others in an athletic cast, including Bill Jay, the lover-bad guy who rips off, a numbers bag woman. But their genial, raunchy, muscular capers quickly become as tiringly repetitious as a succession of burlesque skits they seem to resemble.No comparisons are intended but ""Shoot It"" is, naturally, stern, often provocative fare. In tackling the cold-blooded killing of a black mugger by a white policeman, director - writer Dennis McGuire, who shot the feature in and around Kansas City, is perhaps too perplexingly involved with racial antagonisms, clashing personalities and a young, black film student who has surreptitiously recorded the Crime and ensuing events in a movie to be used in a $1-million suit against the errant policeman.If the principals and their dialogue are naturalistic, their drives and character are, on occasion, shadowy and unconvincing. Among them are Linda Scruggs, as a rich flower girl who denounces our harried hero after a desultory affair, Eric Laneuville, as his young moviemaker-nemeses, and Paul Sorvino, as the square, white lawyer handling the case for the slain man's widow.However, Michael Moriarty (following such fine roles as those in ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" and the Tony Award-winning stint in ""Find Your Way Home"") gives a realistically underplayed performance as the handsome but biased and beleaguered, ill-fated policeman gnawed by rising doubts and guilt. If the somewhat ill-defined causes, effects and points of view tend to flaw ""Shoot It,"" it nevertheless emerges as provocative, if not fully satisfying social melodrama.",1975-07-10T05:00:00+0000

To judge by the commercial success of Mr. Clavell's first two novels, King Rat and TaiPan, it is by an author with a solid track record for yarnspinning. And the storyabout an English ship's pilot who in the year 1600 lands in Japan and gets himself heroically embroiled in a struggle among various warlords for the Shogunate, or military rulership, of the empirewould seem to have everything anyone could possibly ask for in the way of romance, violence, sex, blood, guts, exoticism, violence, suspense, sudden reversals of fortune, violence, or whatever it is one looks for in a novel to transport one away from reality.",1975-07-10T05:00:00+0000

The new film, which opened at theaters throughout the city yesterday, is nowhere near as funny as the first but a lot better than the second.The setting once again is Medfield College, where the students look old enough to be junior executives on Wall Street, and behave like grade-schoolers. This time the magic formula is for a liquid that so fortifies a person that he has superhuman strength. In less time than it takes to tell it, the formula becomes the object of frantic competition between two breakfast-food companies, and the thing that will save the job of Medfield's nutty Dean Higgins, played by the late Joe Flynn.""The Strongest Man in the World"" has a lot of cheerful things in it, including a scene in which Dean Higgins must upbraid the school fat boy for always eating in class. ""All this bag rattling and cracker crunching has got to stop,"" says the furious dean, which makes one long for a world in which cracker crunching might be the paramount problem.Also reassuring are the appearances of Eve Arden and Phil Silvers, as the chiefs of the rival breakfast-food companies whose industrial spy networks recall the worst bungling of the Watergate burglars.For a film designed for very young children, the movie contains one appalling scene that is meant, I assume, to be funny. When a couple of villains prepare the hero for hypnosis, they use acupuncture. They nail a long pin into the young man's skull, which may or may not give some members of the audience ideas.

The adversary is the Ms. Big of the international drug trade, a lesbian known as Dragon Lady, a character that the irrepressible Stella Stevens plays for something more than the little it's worth.The film, which opened yesterday at the Criterion, Apollo and 86th Street East Theaters, is a sequel to ""Cleopatra Jones,"" the 1973 film that was defended in some quarters as being an example (though admittedly a fantastic one) of how black brothers and sisters might get together to clean up the hometown neighborhood.

The Grand Canal, its main thoroughfare, is lined with palaces and other impressive buildings in gothic, Renaissance, baroque and neoclassic styles. The Piazza San. Marco is perhaps the most magnificent public square in the world with the medieval ducal palace and the Byzantine cupolas of St. Mark's Basilica standing side by side as architectural testimony to the meeting of East and West that took place here during the centuries when Venice dominated the trade routes between Europe and the Orient. The piazza is a constant spectacle, with three competing outdoor cafe orchestras, automatons in the clock tower striking the hour, the eternal tourists' feeding the eternal pigeons (a practice tolerated by the city even as it attempts to reduce the pigeon population to protect the city's fragile monuments), the goings and comings of a dozen kinds of small boats at the water's edge.

Responses from readers indicate the overall debate may have fallen into argumentative grooves that are overly confining and ultimately distorting. Assumptions have become too simplified. Reactions are too automatic. On one of the more prominent levels, Senator William Proxmire not only would abolish the Fairness Doctrine but would remove all Federal Communications Commission authority to regulate broadcast content in any manner. In effect, station licenses, now renewed every three years, would be granted in perpetuity. In a letter printed on this page last Sunday, Senator Proxmire explained that the purpose of my proposal is to give broadcast media the full First Amendment rights that are now enjoyed not only by the printed media but even by the movies.",1975-07-13T05:00:00+0000
us,If You Go . . .,"... to Alpbach by car, it's roughly oneandahalf hours southeast of Munich, an hour or less northeast of Innsbruck, or an hour west of Kitzbhel. Map your route as far as Brixlegg, from which there's one road up to Alpbach, about a 15minute drive. Brixlegg is a local stop on the Arlberg Express railroad route between Innsbruck and Salzburg. The nearest express stops are Jenbach and Wrgh from either of these you take a connecting local train to Brixlegg. Accommodations: The Alpbacherhof and Bbglerhof are both Class A hotels where about $20 a day per person (midsummer rate) covers a charming room with bathroom and rustic balcony and three generous meals. Both have heated outdoor swimming pools. Mayor Moser's Boglerhof is on the whole rather sleeker and is the more favored by chic Austrians. The Alpbacherhof has the more hideaway feeling. There are also the Hotel Post (a fullpension room with bathroom and balcony costs about $15 a day); the Messnerwirt Gasthaus (full  pension room without private bathroom, about $11 a day), and the Haus Andreas, the newly built jewelbox annex of the Messnerwirt (fullpension room with bathroom, under $15 a day). At all three, the food is not up to the standard of the Alpbacherhof and Bglerhof, and there is not much in the way of comfortable lounge facilities. But Messnerwirt and Haus Andreas guests have access to the Andreas's indoor swimming pool; and Post guests have a large heated outdoor swimming pool. Both the Post and the Messnerwirt are utterly echt traditional Tyrolean inns in atmosphere and dcor. You can also stay at one of the bedandbreakfast chalets for anywhere from $3 to $8 a night. In that case, you can lunch on picnic cheeses and sausages bought at the village shops, and dine (for $3$7 a person, including wine) at any of the hotels and inns. If you have a car, you can stay outside the village proper at places like the Roosmoos Gasthaus (fullpension but without private bathroom, $4$8 a day) or in one of the upmountain farmhouses (bed and breakfast, $3).",1975-07-13T05:00:00+0000

Freeman, partner in charge of the New York office of the ELS Design Group, and Hardy, a partner in the firm of Hardy, Holzman and Pfeiffer, shared similar motives that prompted their separate moves. First, they totally endorsed the Waterside concept: an urban residential community placed at Manhattan's waterfront, with planned open spaces, retail and recreational facilities, and no cars (a garage lies beneath the plaza). Since both architects lived in brownstones, they looked forward to the stunning views afforded by the buildings location and height, plus the privacy. In addition, each architect could easily walk to work. However, their disparate lirestyles ana aesign preferences have generated quite different responses to the Davis Brodydesigned apartment layouts (most of which would not be called extraordinarygenerally they feature the room dimensions, including the eightfoothigh ceilings, and closet space typical of new luxury buildings).",1975-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Claude Jutra's 'Kamouraska',"Claude Jutra's ""Kamouraska,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a French-Canadian melodrama that is too fastidious and tasteful in some of its parts to qualify as pulp fiction, but too sentimental and foolish to be tragic or even romantic.When the film's illicit lovers misbehave to the point of murder, you don't respond to the grandeur of their passion. You think, instead, that they have dangerously short fuses. What's worse, they are careless. No wonder their lives are blown to bits.The time is the late 19th century, and the setting is rural French Canada. Elisabeth (Genevieve Bujold), a pretty, virginal child of good family, brought up by her widowed mother and maiden aunts, is married off to Antoine Tassy (Philippe Leotard), the young, vigorous lord of Kamouraska, a remote but rich estate that overlooks the St. Lawrence River and even includes some of its islands.The neighbors remarkas neighbors are wont to remark in this kind of moviethat Elisabeth and Antoine make a handsome couple and Elisabeth's first weeks at Kamouraska are blissful. Then, helas, the dream turns into a nightmare.Antoine has terrible table manners. He slurps his food. He eats with his fingers and never, never uses a napkin. He drinks too much, uses gross language and takes his pleasure from Elisabeth in the thoughtless manner of a live-in rapist. But that's not all. Antoine is also certifiably nuts.One night, he scrambles out of bed and tearfully confesses his sins as a drunkard and fornicator, all the while banging his head against a mirror that finally shatters.The next day, when Antoine stands mute in the living room, deep in catatonia, his mother is no help to Elisabeth. ""All he needs is a little black coffee,"" she says with confidence  which is where the movie and I began to lose touch with each other.""Kamouraska"" was adapted for the screen by Mr. Jutra, the director (whose ""My Uncle Antoine"" was shown here in 1972), with Anne Hebert, who wrote the original novel. It's a number of stories awkwardly ellipsed into onethe story of Elisabeth's desperate attempts to get away from Antoine, of her romance with Georges Nelson (Richard Jordan), a moony country doctor, of their various plans to murder Antoine and of Elisabeth's later marriage to a rich, cranky, sick old man who, despite Elisabeth's trial and apparent conviction for complicity in the murder of one husband, depends on her to fetch his life-sustaining medicine.Mr. Jutra is an able director, and he has a much more than able cast of players, but none of them are able to give emotional urgency to material that depends so heavily on our believing in these characters and sharing their sense of sin and guilt. Perhaps the form of the film, which is fractured into bits of time, works against a convincing, cumulative impact. The flashbacks and flashforwards have the effect of distancing us from the events, which is all right in social comedy but is fatal to this kind of headlong melodrama.It's not enough that the film looks very good with all its moody landscapes and snowscapes, its fine country houses and its awareness of the seasons. The characters, too, look absolutely right, especially the mad Antoine of Mr. Leotard, who was so fine in Alain Tanner's ""The Middle of the World.""Miss Bujold is a skilled, sometimes wonderfully surprising actress, but like Mr. Jordan, who gave an especially good supporting performance in ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle,"" she is pretty much mired in the requirements and conceits of second-rate gothic fiction.",1975-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Here on Page 31 is Mr. Mailer debating what to call himself and settling, ever so humbly, on Norman, because he was feeling a little bored with his presence lately and besides that's what everybody in the fight game called him. Elsewhere is Mailer taldng on the familiar selfgenerated psychic daresto do a mile or so of roadwork with All (with the exception of Erich Segal and George Gilder, he had never heard of a writer who liked to runwho wanted the brilliance of the mind discharged through the ankles?); or to take a modestly risky step between two balconies seven stories above the ground (Of course he had done it all in freedom from fear. The freedom that drinking brings). Here is Mr. Mailer discovering in African philosophy a mirror of his beliefs that humans are fortes, not beings, and that history is, an organism, and reveals a sense of style. And everywhere else is the familiar Mailer style, stuffed with rhetorical queries and exclamations beginning with the words What a. . . with an occasional metaphorical intimation of electricity and cancer thrown in for old times sake.",1975-07-14T05:00:00+0000

Cassel, who has been an excellent comedian in the films of De Broca, is the mild-mannered cellist whose ancient Renault one day bump into her Rolls thereby prompting the kind of courtship that only the talent of the late Ernst Lubitsch might have elevated into fabulous farce.In effect, she chases him until he catches her, but the maneuverings are mostly the tactics of coy moviemaking here involving several awful child actors, windshield wipers that comment on the action, a huge but gentle dog, a Siamese cat named Prudhomme, and endless little rages between the lovers that define their real affection.Several years ago, Deville made ""Benjamin,"" in which his appreciation for the classic comedy of manners was charmingly apparent, Charm is the ingredient that is in singularly short supply in ""The Bear and the Doll,"" largely, I suspect, because Miss Bardot, once a sex kitten, now approaches middle age with all of the grace of a seasoned predator.The film, which is in French with English subtitles, opened yesterday at the Paris.",1975-07-17T05:00:00+0000

According to a friend in Halifax, N. S., the way to see the Maritimes is just to drive down to the end of the road. There you will almost always find the seaand with it, perhaps, some fishermen on the way in or out, a colony of painters, a deserted beach, a delightful lobster bar, an unforgettable sunset. The cities in the Maritime Provinces have little appeal, and can be skipped without pangs.

us,Film: Holmes Nostalgia:'Hound' on Bill With First-Rate Keaton,"The first bit in a program of Sherlock Holmes nostalgia at the D. W. Griffith Theater is an old filmed interview with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Stout, mustached and affable, the 68-year-old author made it clear what some people had always suspected: it was Watson who invented Holmes. In any case, Sir Arthur was mainly interested in talking about psychic research.People wanted to know what happened to the generation of young Englishmen who died in World War II, he said. ""Are they dissipated into nothing,"" he inquired, patting his dog, ""or are they still the grand fellows we used to know?""It wasn't Sir Arthur's ghosts that made a success of haunting: it was his stories. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is on Broadway, tourists still go on forlorn searches up Baker Street, Gene Wilder is filming Holmes's younger brother in London and Lord Olivier will tackle Moriarty this fall.The centerpiece of the Holmes's film program is the 1939 Darryl F. Zanuck production of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" It isn't a great picture. It isn't even a great mediocre picture, but it is a good mediocre picture, and perhaps they made better mediocre pictures in those days than they do now.Dartmoor, the funereal setting for ""The Hound,"" may be partly painted backdrop but they roll in enough studio fog to do ""Wuthering Heights twice. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce play Holmes and Watson with comic exaggeration. It is a serious kind of comic exaggeration. It lets you watch it. It doesn't spoof itself: it doesn't wink at you and tell you that it's really just as sophisticated as you are and knows it is making a fool of itself down there on the screen.The hound is just a large ugly dog, but it manages to be quite as frightening as the mechanical floor waxer in a white shark suit that plays the lead in ""Jaws,"" and a lot less gory.And then there are the phrases. ""Mr. Holmes, you're the only man in all England who can help me."" ""I'm in mortal fear Sir Henry's life will be snuffed out."" ""They were the footprints of a gigantic Hound."" ""Watson, keep your eye on that hansom."" ""That's what I hate about his moor, there's always something strange."" And, of course: ""Oh Watson, the needle.""It's like the tunessingable with a life of their ownthat pop out of Gilbert and Sullivan.Some of the audiences leaves after ""The Hound,"" and the usher urges them back to their seats. He's right: the last picture in the program is a 45-minute Buster Keaton classic.""Sherlock Junior"" is not really a Sherlock Holmes picture. It is about a movie projectionist (Keaton) who wants to be a detective, courts a girl, is thrown out after a rival steals her father's watch and lays the blame on him, falls asleep while projecting a picture and dreams himself into the picture. There he becomes Sherlock Holmes, frustrates the scoundrels and wins the girl.If it's not quite the masterpiece that ""The General"" or ""The Navigator"" is, it is still first-rate Keaton. That is, it is both disciplined and wild. The major part of the picture, where in his dream he literally walks down the aisle, climbs into the screen and joins the plot as Holmes, is full of marvelous chases, escapes and battles with exploding billiard balls.But the quieter bits are even better. For example, he sweeps out the theater and finds in the debris two or three dollar bills that will allow him to buy candy for his girl. The customers return one by one to claim them. One is an old woman who comes up weeping. With agony he yields up the dollar bill to her. She takes it and yields her handkerchief to him.",1975-07-22T05:00:00+0000

Later he turned to making movies in which people or animals play the parts of animated drawings.They bound, they double-take, they simper when moved and quack when angry. Their disasterscrashes, plunges through space, explosionsare weightless.""The Apple Dumpling Gang,"" the fourth Disney production to open here this month, is a fair example. It is about a Wild West cardsharp named Donavan who agrees to take delivery of some valuables for a friend, only to find that the valuables are three orphan children.The three children are hellions, of course, and darling to boot. The gambler doesn't boot them, this being Disney Productions: he takes them in with the tough-talking but golden-hearted assistance of a woman stagecoach driver. Adventures occur, including the children's discovery of a giant gold nugget and the efforts of two wildly incompetent bandits to take it away from them.Donavan, played by Bill Bixby, models his sputtering but doomed resistance to the tide of Disneyish good feeling on Donald Duck. The bandits, Don Knotts and Tim Conway, are clearly Disney skunks. The children are chipmunks except for the youngest, played by Celia Bradley. She is a little blond girl who creeps into Donavan's lap and says such things as ""I love you, Mr. Donavan."" She is probably Dumbo.It is as cheerful and indistinguishable as rice pudding. It even has the two-and-a-half raisins that a quality-control office somewhere inside Disney Productions seems to allow its pictures. One, for example, when a bandit tries to rope the gambler and gets tangled up in his own noose. ""Maybe we can head him off at the pass,"" he suggests without any conviction. ""Mmmhmm,"" his partner answers after a long silence.It will keep the children away from poison ivy, and it will probably amuse them, though at a preview most of the laughing was done by a father whose two daughters sat in amiable silence. It won't hurt them, anyway, though after four Disney pictures in one month it may be necessary to hit them a bit if they show signs of crawling into your lap.",1975-07-24T05:00:00+0000

Exorcism,"""Beyond the Door,"" which opened yesterday at the National and Trans-Lux East, reminds us once again that, in some movies, at least, the devil's work is never done. This case, involving a young, pretty San Francisco matron possessed by a demon during a decidedly weird pregnancy, serves only to conjure up a pallid successor to the likes of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist,"" as well as last year's equally imitative ""Abby.""As the work of Oliver Hellman who, the distributors report, is making his theatrical feature-film directorial debut with ""Beyond the Door,"" it is more puzzling than shocking.Gynecologists might note that Juliet Mills's gestation is the speediest on record. Not only is her term alarmingly abbreviated but it's also accompanied by other startling changes. There are ominous sounds and a few furies around to slam doors, open drawers and, above all, to change her into a howling hag with basso voice shouting some raunchy dialogue and with wretching enough to scare the daylights out of her two kids and her terrified, record-producer husband.For reasons understood only by qualified necromancers, it seems that Richard Johnson, who once was her boy friend and appears to have been killed in an auto accident, had made a pact with evil forces.Under the circumstances, the bearded Mr. Johnson; Miss Mills, who is levitated during one of her manufactured seizures and David Colin Jr., as her agitated husband, cannot be faulted for merely acting distraught.",1975-07-24T05:00:00+0000

us,W.W.'Is Pleasant Summer Surprise,"Even if you don't think you're ready for another variation on the one about the traveling con artist and the orphan who melts his slush-cold heart, you may find John G. Avildsen's ""W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings"" an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. It's a skylarking sort of movie, full of the good humor and nave optimism with which you start out on an all-day picnic on the hottest day of the year.""W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings,"" directed by the man who made the schizophrenic ""Joe"" and the sentimental ""Save the Tiger,"" is a small-scale, ebullient period (1957) comedy, set in and around Nashville and its country music business, though it has less in common with Robert Altman's epic ""Nashville"" than with Peter Bogdanovich's folksy ""Paper Moon."" It opened yesterday at Loews State 2, Loews Tower East and other theaters.The film, based on an original screenplay by Thomas Rickman, is about a debonaire, somewhat eccentric holdup man named W.W. (Burt Reynolds), about his 1955 black-and-gold Oldsmobile hardtop, one of Oldsmobile's golden anniversary specials, and about the Dixie Dancekings, a third-rate, five-piece, country band he adopts and, through one awkward ploy and another, guides to Grand Ole Opry stardom.A certain part of this lunge to stardom is financed by W.W. through a series of holdups of S.O.S. gasoline stations, part of the S.O.S. empire owned by a nutty Nashville fundamentalist named Elton Bird (Sherman Lloyd), who looks upon the robberies as the work of the devil. To stem this wave of sin, Elton calls in an old associate, an equally nutty fundamentalist who goes by the name of Deacon (Art Carney).One of the charms of the movie is the casual way it seems to discover its story while it wanders from one minor crisis to the next. Mr. Avildsen's manner here is soft sell. It's a tall story, unhurriedly told, which allows the actors, particularly Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Carney, to work some very funny variations on rather conventional roles.The overpublicized Reynolds machismo is apparent all right, but in this film it fails from time to time, as when he attempts to rob ""the Southland's first drive-in bank"" and succeeds only in wrecking the physical structure.The film's supporting roles are very well cast, largely, it seems, by Nashville country music personalities who are unknown to me. These include Conny Van Dyke, who plays Dixie of the Dixie Dancekings, a steely sort of virgin with a heart of gold, and Jerry Reed, who plays one of the Dancekings. Ned Beatty, who appears as Country Bull Jenkins, a country music star, is the only member of the cast who is also in ""Nashville"" (as the fast-talking lawyer).Mr. Carney isn't around a lot of the time, but he is very funny when he is, especially in a radio broadcast in which he exhorts the audience to be on the lookout for the devilthe true devil, not a metaphoric onedriving that old black-and-gold 1955 Olds. He reminds his listeners that while the devil can change his shape, Oldsmobiles can't.",1975-07-24T05:00:00+0000

From Kittery the coast runs through such popular spots as Ogunquit, with its summer theater and renowned art colony, and Kennebunkport, where the late Kenneth Roberts wrote many of his bestselling novels. Ten miles or so farther north is Old Orchard Beach, which attracts thousands of Canadians.

After all, just because a novel is first on the bestseller list doesn't necessarily tell you what it is. For every badbad book there, like a Love Story or a Jacqueline Susann, you're just as likely to see a goodbad book like The Godfather or Watership Down. Come to think of it, I can't name a No. 1 bestselling novel of the last few decades that hasn't had something extraordinary to rec ommend it (unless it was William Brinckley's Don't Go Near the Water, which I simply never got around to reading), though the Lord knows simply to be extraordinary is by no means necessarily a virtue. So I waded into The Moneychangers confident at least of being diverted. And I wasn't entirely mistaken. To be sure, it would be easy enough to ridicule Mr. Hailey's skills as a novelist. Early in the story he introduces a character, Juanita Nunez, whom he describes simply as looking Puerto Rican (like Jose Ferrer, does he mean? Or like Roberto Clemente?). This Mrs. Nunez is a teller in a bank, one of whose executive vice presidents finds his memories of his father and the bank's dying president to be strangely intertwined (this is Mr. Hailey's way of establishing that the bank president, Ben Rosselli, is a fatherfigure).",1975-07-28T05:00:00+0000
