The movie isn't truly softhearted; if anything, it works very, very hard to be taken seriously. But it has a sentimental streak you could drive a truck through, and that turns out to be its most endearing feature. The nicest thing this movie offers is the spectacle of two young blue-eyed prodigies falling prettily in love. It needn't have strained for much more. ",1980-12-03T05:00:00+0000

Here, as in ''Tribute,'' someone is mortally ill and trying to make sense of life while there's still time. Otherwise, there's no comparison between the two films, since ''Tribute'' is awash in false sentiment and ''Tell Me a Riddle'' is a slow, restrained, dignified effort. ''Tell Me a Riddle,'' which was directed by Lee Grant, opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse. ",1980-12-15T05:00:00+0000

The cast is extremely appealing, and the director, making his feature debut, is Jay Sandrich. Mr. Sandrich, who directed many episodes of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' is no stranger to appealing casts, and he hasn't much modified his television tactics to suit a feature film. He didn't have to. The material here is slick and entertaining, and Mr. Sandrich settles for comic simplicity without reaching for anything more. He coaxes the film along at a cheerfully breakneck rhythm. ",1980-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'THE JAZZ SINGER',"SOUND. Al Jolson. ''Mammy.'' These were three notable ingredients of the original version of ''The Jazz Singer,'' and, among them, only sound is present in the current remake, which stars Neil Diamond. The sound is a mixed blessing, since it allows for Mr. Diamond's often nondescript score, and for the rehash of a plot that makes not one bit of sense any more. Nevertheless, ''The Jazz Singer'' has the sloshy, melodramatic, show-biz appeal of something like ''A Star Is Born,'' which even in its latest, weakest incarnation managed to drag 'em in. This movie has nothing but foolishness to carry it along. At least it is foolishness that pretends, however unsuccessfully, to be grand. ",1980-12-19T05:00:00+0000

This is it, in its entirety: ''Milk Dud?'' The rest of the dialogue has had to do with oil cartels and international intrigue. And it has been so convoluted that Mr. Brando's big moment - kind of a bonbon mot - works well not only because it's funny, but also because it's simple and clear. ''The Formula,'' which has at least as much to do with the price of tea in China as with its apparent subject - the price of oil on the world market - opens today at the Manhattan 1 and other theaters.

us,'BREAKER MORANT' ON THE MORALITY OF WAR,"''Scapegoats of the Empire'' is the title of a book by someone who survived the affair on which ''Breaker Morant,'' a new Australian movie with a dependably old-fashioned manner, is based. The drama takes place in 1901, in South Africa, at the end of the Boer War. The action is confined almost exclusively to a trial, the outcome of which is a fait accompli. The mood of it recalls military drama of the 1950's, like Terence Rattigan's ''Ross.'' In this case, the gears move almost automatically. There's nothing unexpected here, but neither are there omissions of anything an audience might anticipate. As based on Kenneth Ross's play, ''Breaker Morant'' is a shapely and orderly kind of drama. Its greatest strength is that it delivers what it promises. ",1980-12-22T05:00:00+0000
