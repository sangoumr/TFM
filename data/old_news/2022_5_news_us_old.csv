Limn is a master at making a simple idea (that of hindsight, seeing the bright side of things) askew. And so I have/two brains now, she writes. Two entirely different brains.

This hidden weekend lunch spot, operated by the chef Ana Gonzalez Serrano and her partner, Carlos Perez-Puelles, is run out of a roughly 550-square-foot second-floor apartment on a leafy side street in the citys Roma district. The former living area is now an extension of the modest dining room, which can seat up to 14 and is decorated with family photos and books from the couples own residence. In a newly opened lounge just off the main area, Perez-Puelles pours wine and mezcal from a hyperpersonal selection. Gonzalez Serrano, who previously oversaw the corn-based offerings at the citys acclaimed Expendio de Maiz, cooks in a decidedly noncommercial kitchen (her mother, Beatriz, helps with prep), serving polished yet homey dishes that, on a given weekend, might include cheese-stuffed plantain croquettes with hoja santa chimichurri (recalling the coastal state of Veracruz from which half of Gonzalez Serranos family hails); a tostada heaped with buttery turmeric-spiked lentils that is equal parts Mexico, India and France; or Peruvian red rice with pork ribs and huancaina, a cream sauce she makes with poblanos, alliums and cheese.

And while not widespread (yet), human cloning has become a reality. Because he has a terminal illness, Cameron (Mahershala Ali, effortlessly carrying the movie) decides to secretly replace himself with a duplicate so that his wife (Naomie Harris) and their young son will be spared the grief of his death. Cameron elopes to a secluded facility run by Dr. Scott (Glenn Close), where his consciousness is uploaded into a molecularly regenerated copy of his body. But then Cameron finds it hard to let go: Cameron 2 is himself  only one small mole differentiates them  and yet he is not, provoking complex feelings of fear, jealousy and defensiveness. One of the few people who understands the predicament is Kate (Awkwafina), a dying woman spending her last days at Dr. Scotts compound after having been replaced in the outside world by a clone. Bathed in the cold palette and cool details (these characters listen to music on vinyl, of course) that are de rigueur for this type of arty sci-fi, Swan Song does get a little mopey, but it is also insightful about the difficulty of making huge decisions. And it posits a situation that may not be all that far-off.",2022-05-13T15:00:05+0000

This chain of simple, bright spaces with a refrigerated wall holding prepared foods has 27 outlets in Southern California. Mr. Polk says there will be 60 by the end of the year. He plans to expand throughout California and on the East Coast, where he is about to open stores in New York, one in the East Village and two in Chelsea. From the start, his pricing has been flexible, changing according to the median household income in a particular ZIP code. (A serving of carnitas tacos will be $5.75 in the East Village and $7.75 in Chelsea.) As in the California locations, the food for New York is cooked and packaged in a central kitchen as portions for one person and with a four-day shelf life; preparation is done in the former Pfizer industrial building in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Healthy food is more expensive than fast food, but a central kitchen drives down the cost, Mr. Polk said. We are still profitable even at the lower price point in some neighborhoods. The company also has its own delivery team, and there are plans for two locations in Harlem, one near City Hall, one in the financial district and another in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

I will book a direct flight at a good time and then get an email days or weeks later with an inconvenient time change or an added layover or both. The worst was when I was planning a trip with my daughter to Tampa, Fla. In January, I booked a direct flight on Southwest Airlines that left Hartford, Conn., at 12:30 p.m. on April 17 and arrived in Tampa three hours later. Perfect. But on Feb. 15, Southwest emailed that they had moved me onto a 6:15 p.m. flight with a nearly three-hour layover in Nashville, getting me to Tampa at 1:10 a.m.! Why is this OK?

So he moved to Albany, N.Y., started catering and considered opening a restaurant. Its something I thought I could do, he said. Now, at age 34, he is a restaurateur, specializing in Cajun and Creole cooking. He enrolled in an online hospitality business program through Cornell University, found advisers and a business partner, and then, because of Covid, was able to pick up a restaurant space at a reasonable rent. His sliver of a restaurant in TriBeCa is named for fil powder, the ground sassafras thickener often used for making gumbo. But hes from Boise, Idaho, not the Bayou. He said he grew up eating Louisiana fare, which his maternal grandfather, Aubrey Gaines, known as Tiny, would cook at home. (Though he wasnt a Louisiana native, Mr. Gaines learned the cuisine in his travels with a construction company.)

Like the Hudson Valley and Long Island, New Jersey is a major source, but not just for seasonal field-grown fruit. A couple of indoor growers, Bowery Farming and Oishii, are cultivating them indoors with no seasonal limitations. Theyre grown without pesticides and are sold at Tiffany prices. Now Oishii has just opened a major new indoor vertical farm in a former Anheuser-Busch plant in Jersey City, N.J., and the increased production is allowing the company to reduce prices by about half, so a tray of 11 delicious medium-size Omakase Berries is now $20, or six for $11. The Whole Foods in NoMad, 63 Madison Avenue (28th Street), which opens this week, is selling them, as are a number of the citys high-end food retailers. Oishiis berries might be worth considering once the local season, with berries for around $10 a quart, winds down.",2022-05-31T15:02:56+0000

With Crown Shy, Harrys, Nobu Downtown, Temple Court, the new Le Gratin and this gracious restaurant and bar by John Fraser in the Wall Street Hotel, its heading in that direction again. The hotel, owned by Paspaley, a major pearl company in Australia, is in a repurposed office building with a mercantile past. (The restaurants name  the merchant in French  reflects that.) An elegant bar leads to a white-tablecloth dining room with an elaborate raw bar and a couple of semiprivate tables framed in heavy drapes. Despite the formality of the setting, Mr. Fraser hopes to attract what he sees as a younger crowd who live and work in the area, by modernizing the French fare that shaped his career in Paris. Im looking at the 21st century, using global ingredients, sometimes out of left field, he said. Hes supported by his executive chef, Rick Horiike, who worked at Buddakan and Wild Ink. Among the raw-bar items and appetizers on the lengthy menu are beef tartare, asparagus or blue crab enclosed in rice paper rolls; littleneck clams with cilantro mignonette; and lightly seared duck breast, sliced carpaccio-thin, with a drizzle of fish sauce caramel. Main courses include sweet rice with mushrooms cooked in a banana leaf, a version of homard  lAmricaine made with coconut milk, coffee-crusted pork chop with lentils, trout baked with a basting of miso, and roasted or steamed Dover sole for two with vermouth-lime butter. Desserts include a floating island with Japanese-style cheesecake. Amy Racine, the beverage director for Mr. Frasers JF Restaurants, will oversee the 120-label wine list that, while mostly French, lists some Australian selections to honor the hotels owners.
