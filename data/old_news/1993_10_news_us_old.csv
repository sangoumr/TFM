us,HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT,"Scouting the Top Teams Following are the scouting reports for this weekend's top games in the Public Schools Athletic League and Catholic High Schools Football League as well as for New Jersey, Connecticut, Westchester County and Rockland County. The teams' records are in parentheses. P.S.A.L. Sheepshead Bay (2-0) at Lafayette (1-2) Key Players: Both teams feature a ball-control offense and rely on hard-hitting defensive units. ""Brooklyn football is like the Midwest,"" said Sheepshead Bay Coach Dick Reilly. ""It's bang-bang football."" Lafayette's linemen may have trouble moving defensive end Elvis Abellard (19 tackles) and Company off the ball, as the Frenchies are significantly smaller than the Skippers up front. Lafayette will probably have to throw the ball to create running lanes. Sheepshead Bay features a more balanced attack, as Michael Reilly, the coach's son, is a smart quarterback with an accurate arm to complement the fine running combination of Kwesi Daniels and Joe Coffey. Daniels received Sheepshead Bay's game ball last week after rushing for 145 yards on 18 carries and 1 touchdown in the 15-14 victory over Curtis. Daniels also registered 15 tackles and 2 sacks as a linebacker. Comment: Lafayette has won the last two meetings against Sheepshead Bay in the closing seconds. Lafayette defeated the Skippers, 13-6, last year and by 19-17 in 1991. ""Those are the ones that put the white back into your beard,"" said Reilly, Sheepshead Bay's coach. Lehman (1-1) at South Shore (0-2) Key Players: What South Shore quarterback Adrian Nazario lacks in size (5 foot 5 inches, and 150 pounds), he makes up in heart. ""He's a tough kid,"" said Coach Stan Feldman. ""He gets knocked down and he pops right back up. He's our leader."" Nonetheless, the Vikings' offense still depends on the running of Tracey McDonald, Carlos Cromwell and Dwayne Bennett. Lehman needs Robert Talley to rebound from last week's 30-7 loss to Canarsie, in which he was limited to 27 yards rushing on 10 carries. Comment: South Shore has yet to score a point this season, losing by 26-0 in its opener against Curtis and by 20-0 to Lincoln. ""I'm really proud of the boys,"" said Feldman. ""They haven't given up, and they've been gung-ho in practice."" C.H.S.F.L. Spellman (2-1) at St. John the Baptist (3-0) Key Players: St. John the Baptist's offense is ranked No. 1 in the A Division, averaging 271.3 yards a game. Eric Martin (31 of 55 for 533 yards, 5 touchdowns, 1 interception), who is the division's leading passer, has three sure-handed targets in tight end Robert Kelly (11 receptions for 219 yards, 2 touchdowns), wide receiver Dennis McGuire (6 for 100 yards, 1 touchdown) and running back Mike Grippo (11 for 163 yards, 2 touchdowns). Martin's counterpart, David Rodriguez, is a pretty good signal caller himself, passing for 2 touchdowns and rushing for 2 others. Rodriguez's favorite receiver is Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 71 yards, 1 touchdown). Comment: Jay Byrne Gamble, the St. John the Baptist coach, is back after a 10-year hiatus. He has returned to the school where he had three consecutive Metro Bowl titles after serving part of the time as an assistant coach at Hofstra University. His presence, along with a new staff of assistants, has helped turn around a program that had a 12-35-1 record over the past three years. St. Anthony (3-0) vs. Nazareth (2-0) at Canarsie Key Players: St. Anthony has averaged a league-best 369 yards on the ground a game, while the Kingsmen defense has allowed a league-low of 89 yards rushing. The Friars' offense, which averages over 30 points a game, revolves around the backfield of Tony Williams (38 carries for 615 yards, 6 touchdowns), who is the league's leading gainer, and Dan Shea (22 carries for 268 yards, 6 touchdowns). Nazareth boasts a good inside (Julien Dale) and outside (Gordon Tunison) running attack. Dale, a 6-foot, 220-pound fullback, has carried 28 times for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns. Tinson is a 5-5, 140-pound tailback who has rushed 17 times for 218 yards and 3 touchdowns. Comment: St. Anthony's backfield is quick and has been aided by playing all of its games on Astroturf, an advantage that St. Anthony's runners will enjoy once again this afternoon. Long Island Longwood (1-0) at Brentwood (0-1) Key Players: Longwood's backfield of Jason Schuster (4.6 for 40 yards), John Lange (4.7 speed) and quarterback Eric Brown (4.5 speed) is lightning quick. The threesome combined last week for over 400 yards rushing in a 35-7 victory over Ward Melville. Felipe Sabino will do most of Brentwood's running behind Carl Matzen (6-2, 286-pound tackle) and John Alvarado (6-2, 250-pound guard), both of whom anchor the right side. Comment: Longwood is ranked No. 2 in Suffolk County and 21st in New York State by the Sports Writers Association. Last year, Longwood lost to Connetquot, 28-7, in the county's final. ""I think that experience is going to help us,"" said Schuster. ""We experienced what it's like, and hopefully we're going to learn from it."" New Jersey Elizabeth (1-0) at Linden (1-0) Key Players: Elizabeth is once again loaded with Division 1 talent: tailback Kaream Bowser, Sharod Williams (wr-db), Hector Sepuleeda (dt-og) and linebacker Frank Chmiel are all being heavily recruited by colleges. This talented bunch is directed by sophomore Al Hawkins, who is a ""scary quarterback who could throw the long ball off his heels,"" said Linden Coach James McDonald. Linden's two blue-chip prospects are two-way ends Mike Pringley (6-4, 218) and Dave Biles (6-4, 275). Comment: Last year, Elizabeth had eight Division 1 players but only managed a 5-4 record. ""We had a bunch of superstars that were only interested in themselves,"" said Coach Jerry Moore. He added that this year's team works better together. ""I like the chemistry of this group. They work hard and are very aggressive. And when we hit you, you stay hit. They are playing Elizabeth's style of football."" Fieldston (1-1) at Dwight-Englewood (0-2) Key Players: ""To let Gus Ornstein set up is to set yourself up to get beat,"" Englewood Coach Dave Hansburg said of Fieldston's quarterback. Ornstein (16 of 35 for 219, 1 touchdown, 1 interception), who is being recruited by Michigan, Notre Dame and Miami as a quarterback and first baseman, has the ability to pick apart opposing defenses if given the time. Sam Gilbert (4 catches, 122 yards, 1 td) is Fieldston's deep threat. Fieldston will have to contain the Bulldogs backfield of Josh Walsky, Rick Komotar and Steve Milo. Comment: The outcome will be determined on the line of scrimmage, where Fieldston's over-matched line will be called upon to hold back the rush of tackles Luis Locuroto and Matt Seiff. Connecticut Bassick (1-1) at Darien (1-1) Key Players: Johnny Barnes (23 carries for 154 yards, 3 touchdowns) is the best of Bassick's speedy backs capable of springing at any time. James Hanford (172 yards rushing and 3 touchdowns) and Vince Childress (181 yards, 2 touchdowns) share the running duties for Darien. Jeff Eaton's (13 for 32 for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns) ability to complete the short passes gives the Blue Wave's offense a more diversified attack than Bassick's. Chris Robbins (9 catches for 193 yards, 1 touchdown) is Eaton's primary target. Comment: Darien Coach Mike Sangster says he plans to drop a few plays from the teams' playbook after losing by 21-20 to Greenwich last week, snapping the teams' 16-game unbeaten string. ""I just think that we made too many mistakes last week and that we need to go back to the basics,"" he said. Westchester and Rockland North Rockland (3-0) at Roosevelt (3-0) Key Players: While both teams are comparable in size, North Rockland's linemen hold the advantage over the Indians' less experienced big men. Tom Morreira (tackle, 6-2, 270), Conrad Bartosik (guard, 6-0, 200), Ed Teitz (center, 6-2, 260), Tom Johnson (guard, 6-0, 200) and Rajah Winn (tackle, 5-9, 260) will need to gain maturity in a hurry and find a way to open holes for Roosevelt's star runner, Franklin McBride. He has rushed for 4 scores and over 100 yards in each of the teams' games. McBride's counterpart is Marcus Larkins, a 5-8, 170-pound runner who has rushed for 344 yards and 5 touchdowns. Raiders quarterback Jeff Becker (12 of 25 for 281 yards, 5 touchdowns) is a quality drop-back passer who sees the whole field and delivers the ball with accuracy. Comment: ""This could be the biggest game ever played in Westchester and Rockland County,"" said Roosevelt Coach Tony Dematteo. The teams have never met during the regular season. The game will be carried live on Channel 3 on TCI Cable.",1993-10-02T05:00:00+0000

There were more elegant speak-easies in New York than Mario's, converted East Side mansions with handsome iron gates and the imposing air of art galleries that deal only in Old Masters, but they were expensive and intimidating. Mario's occupied the two lower floors of a rundown brownstone in the West 40's; it could once have been a theatrical boardinghouse and was now a speak-easy only in the sense that it sold illegal liquor and that its owner went through the required ritual of inspecting his customers through a peephole in the locked front door. In all other respects it was a family-style trattoria, serving excellent home-cooked food at low prices. Most important, it was safe to drink its liquor. Every day during the Prohibition years the newspapers published their grim toll of people blinded or killed by wood alcohol.

In this century, life expectancy has grown by 30 years; between 1970 and 1985, the number of people over 65 increased more than 35 percent; and women over 85 form the fastest-growing group of the elderly in the United States and the world.

us,National League Championship Matchup,"ON THE MOUND Can They Get The Final Outs? The rotation gave the revolution the club staged over the second half in the N.L. West its momentum. It's deep and often unmerciful, paid multi-millions to allow as close to nothing as possible. The team's collective e.r.a. of 3.14 wasted the rest of the competition in the N.L. Greg Maddux should win his second straight Cy Young Award, Tom Glavine won 20 games for the third straight season and Steve Avery has the most sinister stuff of all of them. John Smoltz, the man with all the pitches and all too often the habit of wasting a great part of his talent, is a post-season deity in Atlanta. He seems to find his zone when the October moonlight finds him on the mound. Avery split his season record against the Phillies, his e.r.a. a full half a point higher versus Philadelphia than it was for the season. He will also be facing the club's right-handed lineup, certainly its more lethal incarnation. Maddux simply is the best pitcher in baseball at the moment. He walks no one, gives up a hit every five innings or so and always takes his club deep into games. Glavine, who has a mixed post-season resume at best, may enter the scene with the most to personally prove. The bullpen, as almost virtually all in baseball are, is ordinary. Mark Wohlers throws hard, but straight, and so is turning around a lot on the mound. Kent Mercker never seems to throw strikes when he has to. Steve Bedrosian and Jay Howell have been effective surprises. But the Braves have not won the World Series the last two seasons because they never seemed able to get the final out. Greg McMichael, barely invited to spring training, gets the invitation to make history for the Braves as the club's closer. But the right-hander, whose out pitches are not strikes, has been awfully suspect after a summer-long run of fantasy finishes. The Phillies, who have faced McMichael six tmes in 1993, stuck him with an 8.53 e.r.a. At Least They're Healthy Conventional wisdom says the Phillies are at the wrong end of a mismatch in this department. As usual, there's considerable truth to standard thinking. The club's starters, a revelation over the first half, were often wounded and worked over across the team's uneven trek to October's promised land. Tommy Greene has been hurt, and Terry Mulholland was once feared done for the season. All are now available and certainly capable. They may have to be much more. Their track record, though, says the corps, one augmented Danny Jackson's left-handed presence, will give the Phillies innings, keep them close enough for there to be hope that the offensive engine will wear down the opposition. Certainly, turning the games over to the bullpen will be a mortifying option. The contingent of relievers, one the front office sought all season to improve and alter, was ranked 11th in the N.L. They together amassed 24 blown saves. The Phillies, not surprisingly, were a marginal 23-20 in one-run games. Mitch Williams, the theoretical closer, is the perfect top man for a below average bullpen. His final pitching line of the season about captured the perpetually potential downside to his dramatics: 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 runs, 2 walks, 2 wild pitches. Advantage Braves IN THE FIELD Sometimes Vulnerable You don't win three straight division titles without a line of defense, and the fielding fortifications for the Braves got more imposing when McGriff was added. His bat gets people's attention and headlines and it might have got him more than a handful of MVP votes (McGriff's arrival sparked the inflation of everyone's averageinfalted the averages of his cohorts at the chop shop, but his play aty first might get the Braves an extra out or two when it counts most this series. But Atlanta, whose overall fielding efforts ranked third in the N.L., isn't without its departments of defense that trouble Manager Bobby Cox. Terry Pendleton, garnerer of Gold Gloves, has been erratic this season at third. Ron Gant, for all his speed and hustle, still can seem unrefined three years after his conversion to an outfielder. David Justice can launch the odd throw that looks more like one of his home runs. And the defense's vulnerability was on full and painful display over the season's final stretch. Freddy Krueger With a Glove It can be Nightmare on Broad Street when the Phillies slip into their slapstick routine in the field. It can happen anytime with this club, and there won't be a worse time than if the Phillies don't make the routine and remarkable plays in October that win championships. Dave Hollins is the first baseman of the future, only he now plays third base in the present. He doesn't do it soundly. John Kruk, the man who does play first, hasn't of late played it nearly as efficiently and airtightly as he had earlier in the season. The club turned the fewest number of double plays of any club in the N.L. in 1993. It also made 141 errors, their defense finding its rightfully mediocre place in the second tier of the league (9th place.) Pete Incaviglia, the man with the World's Gym upper body and world's worst set of wheels, can be an adventure in left. Lenny Dykstra still runs into walls in cnter, but doesn't pick himself up with the ball in his glove quite as often. Advantage Braves. AT THE PLATE Well-Balanced and Hot ""There are good lineups at the plate - Texas, San Francisco, Philadelphia,"" said Ron Gant, the left-fielder for the Braves. ""None are hot like we are hot."" The temperature turned out these numbers - Atlanta's 169 homers led the N.L. and Gant, David Justice and Fred McGriff all hit 30 or more homers and drove in 100 or more runs. It's a lineup blessed with fabulous balance - Otis Nixon's basehit bunts and afterburners (his 47 stolen bases were good enough for 3rd in N.L.), Jeff Blauser's hit parade out of the No. 2 hole (182 for a shortstop), Terry Pendleton's decision to go nuts with the bat the last week of the season (the third baseman drove in nine over the final weekend), and Mark Lemke's repeated flair for post-season mass production. The lineup had a perfectly healthy appetitite for the strong-arm offerings of the Phillies, as Justice, Pendleton and McGriff combined to hit .333, with Justice homering three times. Gant, though, could be the wild card. With right-handers Tommy Greene and Curt Schilling coming at the Braves in Game 1 and Game 2, Gant, who hit only .191 against the Phillies, will be under the microscope to see if the breakthrough in the clutch he made throughout the second half of 1993 extends to the second season. They Score in Bunches The club nearly scored 900 runs in 1993, a staggering total that wasn't hurt by the 5.3 runs a game the club scored on average in its 12 games with the Braves. Len Dykstra, who might have been the runaway choice for N.L. MVP in the absence of Barry Bonds, is a machine of offensive menace, on base always and across the plate more than any other player in baseball this season. He's a lifetime .312 hitter against Atlanta. The heart of the order is as patient and muscular as they come - John Kruk (.430 on-base percentage, .316 average), Darren Daulton (105 r.b.i., 117 walks) and Dave Hollins (.330 against left-handers.) And the attack - Philadelphia's club average of .274 trailed only the Giants - has been aided by assorted phenomena - Pete Incaviglia drove in an astonishing 89 runs in only 368 at-bats (the left-fielder hit four homers against Atlanta pitching) and and Kevin Stocker, a minor-league promotion halfway through the season, hit .324 in 70 games. Key questions would involve how fast Daulton's bat still is (the catcher played in 147 games), how a lack of team speed might hurt the club in a short series (the Phillies were next to last in the N.L. in stolen bases), and the ability of players with great numbers but inconclusive track records (Mariano Duncan, Jim Eisenreich) to produce in the passion of post-season. Advantage Phillies. OFF THE BENCH Not Glamorous, But Solid Sid Bream, Rafael Belliard, Bill Pecota. They aren't glamorous names, but they are the estimable backbone of the bench for the Braves. They'll provide professional defense and the occasional quality at bat in a big spot. And the dugout isn't devoid entirely of intriguing mercenaries. Deion Sanders can steal a base and make an impact if asked to start. And Francisco Cabrera, whose 15 minutes of fame might have been among the most intense in baseball history hit .357 with a homer and three r.b.i. against the Phillies this year. Which Ones Are They? It's hard to separate the bench from the regulars. Jim Eisenreich hit .318 as the right-fielder against right-handers and Milt Thompson drove in 44 runs as the left-fielder against right-handers. Pete Incaviglia wreaked havoc against lefties and Wes Chamberlain hit 12 homers and 20 doubles in under 300 at-bats. The bench is deep beyond the platoon, too. Todd Pratt 87 as the backup catcher and pinch-hitter. Rickey Jordan who can homer on half-swings, hit .289. And Kim Batiste can fill the role of home-run threat. Advantage Phillies.",1993-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Giuliani, dressed in red plaid jacket and discreet gold earrings, facing camera in office setting with warm wood-toned television cabinet in background. At one point, footage is interspersed of Mr. Giuliani in a hard hat and plaid workshirt, talking first with a white construction worker and then a black one at a building site. As she says her final lines, Ms. Giuliani first nods, then shakes her head just a bit. PRODUCER: The Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: As a journalist, I thought I'd seen everything. I was wrong. I'm Donna, Rudy Giuliani's wife. My husband was called a fascist by a group of ministers endorsing David Dinkins. And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support my husband are called racist. This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence. Of course I want people to vote for Rudy Giuliani. But I want them to vote for Rudy because he's the best man for the job, not for any other reason. ACCURACY: In endorsing the Mayor last week, the Rev. William H. Jones, the head of a black Baptist ministers group, said Mr. Dinkins had been unfairly branded a murderer in the death of a Hasidic scholar in Crown Heights and that people who made such charges included fascist ""elements"" that has grown around Mr. Giuliani. But he did not call Mr. Giuliani a fascist. While some Dinkins supporters have said that some white Democrats are backing Mr. Giuliani largely because of his race, Mr. Dinkins has never explicitly ascribed racial motives to them. The Mayor often says that for blacks to vote for a black or Italians to vote for an Italian is an expression of pride, while voting against someone because of his origin constitutes racism. SCORECARD: Mr. Giuliani often contends that Mr. Dinkins is too willing to paint himself as a victim of racial animosities, and this commercial, and a similar one by Mr. Giuliani's running mate for Comptroller, Herman Badillo, argues that Mr. Giuliani is the true victim -- of guilty liberal voters reluctant to oppose a black candidate. Without saying so, it objects that few politicians or pundits find it troubling that more than 90 percent of black voters back Mr. Dinkins, while often bemoaning the fact that barely one quarter of whites support the Mayor. That amounts to a call to arms to Mr. Giuliani's strongest white ethnic backers to support him with pride, and to white liberals to be offended by appeals to guilt and focus on competence instead. It trades on Ms. Giuliani's reputation as a former news anchorwoman for WPIX-TV to make its case in a Checkers meets Diane Sawyer vein, and sorrowful tone as she stands by her man puts a soft edge on a tough message. But the ad also risks seeming disengenuous: While ostensibly saying that race should not be an issue, it actually goes to great lengths to highlight and trade on racially inflammatory remarks.

Sending him to Conran's-Habitat - the Valhalla of the pared-down and contemporary look - to shop for living room furnishing might seem like a dare. He insists not. ""I hate to disillusion you,"" says Mario Buatta, ""but it's a fallacy that I have to have chintz in a room."" Nor was the space he worked in steeped in wood-paneled tradition: a new condominium apartment with wide-open views of the Manhattan skyline and Central Park. In making the room his own, Buatta shopped for the big-ticket items at Conran's, then applied his signature touch: pattern on pattern. ""I try to work the way Mother Nature does, putting together different shapes and textures,"" he says. ""Think of a forest where there are all theses different colors, lights, textures and even smells, but it's still calm and restful. That's my aim,"" At Conran's, Buatta made a beeline for sinkably soft furniture to cushion the condo's boxy proportions and for patterned upholstery to give warmth. To these he added layers of colored fabric and an intriguing miscellany of books, dog prints, objects and plants. The result is vintage Buatta - but without a stitch of chintz in sight. The following items are available at Conran's-Habitat stores nationwide. For the nearest location or to order, call (800) 326-6726. 1.

In the chronology of the gardens on David's 1 1/2-acre property in the hills overlooking Austin, Tex., ""food came first,"" he says, although one would never know to see his kitchen garden that it preceded the ornamental garden by several years. Designed by David and composed and cared for by Gary Peese, his partner in Gardens, a native-Texas and specialty-plants nursery in Austin, the fruit-and-vegetable garden is woven seamlessly into the sophisticated overall plan. It is behind and just north of the kitchen, overlooking a gravel terrace where a pair of persimmon trees points to wide limestone steps leading down to a dry creek that eventually will be shaped and dammed for a pond. The vegetables take up two rectangular plots on different levels, separated by another gravel terrace and limestone retaining walls bordered by herbs, shrubs and flowers. Out of the unmortared wall grow clumps of zinnias and periwinkles and a lone moss rose. Yellow cherry tomatoes have sprouted from the gravel, as happy here as in the confines of the 500-square-foot garden. ""Plants love the aeration the gravel provides,"" says David.

We drove a thousand miles from Iowa to get there, me burbling the whole way about how much he would love it. We arrived just at sunset. The pine paneling was alight, the pond was a glassy platinum steel, the nearer hillsides were an impossibly rich green, which shaded in the distance to a color I think of as Catskill purple. I was ecstatic. We walked through the living room, me twirling, Steve contemplative. Just as I turned to carol, ""Isn't this great?"" I heard him mutter, ""Floor's not level.""

us,Q and A,"Turned Down For Refinancing Q. Recently I attempted to refinance the mortgage on our 613-square-foot house on 1.8 acres, which can be claimed as our primary home because of the amount of time we spend there. I found, however, that it was impossible because most lenders said that there was too little house for the parcel of land. We could not find any bank -- with one exception -- that would consider refinancing for a home under 850 square feet. Unfortunately, that lender rejected our application because the home has no central-heating system. The house is insulated and heated with propane. Are there any banks that would refinance our mortgage? There is no problem with credit or equity. . . . Margaret Hannigan, Manhattan",1993-10-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Ethan Allen,"""I always thought of Ethan Allen as the place to go for stately Colonial furniture,"" says the interior designer Victoria Hagan. ""I was surprised to find so many contemporary peices and accessories, too."" The chain's wide selection allowed the designer to indulge in her favorite kind of shoping spree. ""Ethan Allen displays their merchandise in complete collections and room vignettes,"" she says. ""The fun is in taking some pieces from one set and some from another. Mixing helps create a more timeless interior."" The room she decorated - a sunny bedroom in a prewar town house - is light and airy. White walls and furniture, she figured, would allow for a variety of accessories. Pieces with sculptural shilhouettes, such as the metal-framed bed, and interesting details, such as the nail heads on the sofa arms, were high on her list. And for a twist, there's a pie rack usually sold as a Colonial memento that Hagan found ideal for books and magazines. ""One-stop shopping can be terrific,"" she concludes, ""as long as you remember that it's the personalized details that make a room come alive.""

When Futurism Met Fascism","In ITALIAN ART DECO: Graphic Design Between the Wars (Chronicle, paper, $16.95), Steven Heller and Louise Fili delineate Art Moderne in Italy as ""the offspring of two volatile parents: Futurism and Fascism -- with consumerism as its stabilizing grandparent."" In a generous sampling of posters, labels, packages, signs and logos for such things as candy, liquors, travel, cigarettes, Fiats and Campari, this small monograph illuminates a sublime hallmark in the history of industrial arts, an effort to present and yet to propagandize. At the onset of World War I, Italy had enjoyed less than half a century of unified statehood. Its artistic aspirations were suspended between the Fascist desire for an undiluted Italy and the belle epoque's romance with nature, between a mimicry of other European styles and the reincorporation of Italy's own classical legacy, between a giddy quest for an avant-garde and a vernacular means to persuade a population, 30 percent of which was illiterate, to feel optimism amid an economic crisis. As Mr. Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Ms. Fili, a New York designer, show, the resultant style incorporated a humanizing of technology, a mythic treatment of contemporary imagery, and airbrushed shapes that suggested an egoless production. While the Futurists' work by self-definition was a reckless, audacious movement -- for industry it proved frivolous, for advertising almost useless -- the resulting graphic work extracted the workable, pragmatic aspects otherwise buried in the rarefied bombast of art manifestoes. ""Italian Art Deco"" displays the objects of Italy's longed-for arte-vita, the availability of art in everyday life. Fifty years later, the Art Moderne designers' dreams of a future with radio, air travel and robots has been fulfilled, and still their designs possess the radiance of a charmed modernity.MICHAEL J.

But based on an experience we had two years ago, those reserving there should be sure to get a room in the old building. A newer building has rooms that are infinitely less charming than the main building; indeed, they're rather lifeless. We had specified the old building, got a room in the new building, didn't like it, and successfully insisted on a room in the old building. There's no comparison. DAN HARRISON Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. Clyde Haberman responds: While rooms in the new wing may lack the grace of those in the old, some visitors consider them to be more comfortable and also quieter. The morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of the nearby mosque is charming. But not everyone can catch the spirit at 4:30 A.M., and the new wing provides enough distance for those preferring muffled muezzins.",1993-10-10T05:00:00+0000

Chatham is a self-avowed ""modernist with a sense of humanity"" who likes basic shapes and colors. ""When you work with solids, it's hard to go wrong,"" he emphasizes. Shopping to fill a loft-sized family room, Walter Chatham went for extremes in terms of shape: Two voluptuously overstuffed leather sofas are flanked by skinny six-foot metal lamps with yellow shades that reminded the architect of the sculptor Giacometti's attenuated figures. But Chatham's overall intention was to use furnishings to create a pleasantly neutral background - one that could both absorb and encourage an active family life.

Producer; The Garth Group of New York The Script: Ms. Giuliani: Let me tell you about my husband's record on women's rights. In his law practice, Rudy fought for split schedules and extended maternity leave so female lawyers could take care of their families without sacrificing their careers. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted an abortion clinic bomber who went to jail for seven years. Rudy helped establish New York City's first on-site childcare center for federal workers and he appointed the first woman in the country to head an Organized Crime Strike Force. And make no mistake about it, Rudy Giuliani is pro-choice. Accuracy: Lawyers who would know whether Mr. Giuliani fought for split schedules as a lawyer in private practice at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler from 1977 through 1981 could not be reached for comment over the past few days. But in all other respects the commercial is accurate, though perhaps making Mr. Giuliani more central to events than he was. When he was United States Attorney, his office did prosecute the case of Dennis J. Malvasi, an abortion clinic bomber who turned himself in after John Cardinal O'Connor made a televised appeal for him to surrender. He was sentenced in 1987 to seven years in prison.

us,Whitman on Florio: Accusations of Corruption,"Candidate: Christine Todd Whitman Producer: The Murphey Pintak Gautier Agency. Washington Text: (Voiceover) Whitman and Florio. Compare. Christie Whitman wants to cut state spending. Jim Florio increased spending by three billion dollars. Christie Whitman wants to create new jobs with tax cuts. Jim Florio raised taxes billions and he won't rule out raising taxes again. Whitman will clean up state Government. Florio's administration is under two grand jury investigations. Jim Florio. Rising unemployment, corruption, high taxes. We can't afford more. Christie Whitman. A change for the better. Visual: Still photos of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio appear side by side -- predictably she is smiling engagingly while he is frosty -- while graphics echo the truncated words of the narrator. Her image disappears when the specter of corruption is mentioned, replaced at the Governor's side by stacks of money and news headlines reading ""State Jobless Rate Reaches 7.7 % For Second Rise in a Row"" and ""Lax Ethical Standards."" Analysis: What's new here is the odor of corruption. In earlier television spots, Mrs. Whitman tried to saddle Mr. Florio with all the bad effects of a prolonged recession while contrasting the $2.8 billion tax increases he pushed through the Legislature in 1980 with her campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.4 billion. (Mrs. Whitman herself refuses to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.) While mention of the two grand juries is fair game, equating them with proof of corruption is not, and Mrs. Whitman's pledge ""to clean up state Government"" not only lacks specifics but means little without evidence that it is dirty. A state grand jury is looking into allegations that $1.5 million in excess state school aid was sent to the Democratic-controlled town of Lyndhurst , which GOP partisans have painted as a political payoff ordered by the Governor's office. Meanwhile, a Federal grand jury has been examining the old practice, unique to neither party, of directing profitable state bond business to Wall Street fat cats who make hefty campaign contributions to the party in power. The fly in Mr. Florio's ointment here is that Joseph C. Salema Jr., his chief of staff and political satrap, was a partner in a bond consulting firm that profited handsomely from state decisions. Mr. Salema resigned last May to spare the Governor further embarrassment, but so far Federal investigators have not indicated that any laws were broken. Some Democrats question whether Mrs. Whitman, whose husband is a wealthy Wall Street broker and whose late father was a Republican power broker and fund-raiser, is all that shocked by back-room deals between Trenton and captains of finance.

us,Giuliani on the Attack,"Striving to put Mayor David N. Dinkins back on the defensive, Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials and two similar radio ads, harshly attacking the Mayor's record in office and a range of personal or professional lapses dating back two decades. This is one of them. ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with big words on screen ""Maybe we should have known better,"" next to a tiny picture of Mr. Giuliani noting that his campaign paid for it. Followed by pictures of a Comptroller's report, and a quotation from it: ""...serious internal control weaknesses over revenue..."" Then newspaper headlines, title noting that Mr. Dinkins failed to file tax returns from 1969 through 1972, footage of Korean boycott, Crown Heights, asbestos sign on a dumpster, and titles that repeat much of the narration. It ends with a picture of Mr. Dinkins, with a smirky smile, and the words ""It's not my fault."" Last image: White letters on black background, ""Maybe it was our fault four years ago."" PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York THE SCRIPT: Male narrator: ""Maybe we should have known better. When David Dinkins was City Clerk, a Comptroller audit found that his office was a financial mess. He also forgot to pay Federal, state and city income taxes four years in a row. You think you'd get away with it? Then he becomes Mayor, and we get the Korean boycott, the Crown Heights riots, the PVB scandal, asbestos in the schools and on top of that, we lose 350,000 jobs. And all David Dinkins says is, it's not my fault. Maybe he's right. Maybe it was our fault four years ago."" ACCURACY: Two audits by the City Comptroller did fault the management of the City Clerk's office during Mr. Dinkins's tenure from 1975 to 1985. He failed to file income tax returns and pay all taxes due from 1969 through 1972, but he later paid the taxes with penalities and there was no prosecution. As one of the Giuliani radio ads notes, the lapse prevented Mr. Dinkins from becoming the city's first black deputy Mayor in 1973. The school asbestos problem long predated the Mayor's tenure in office, and economists say the city government cannot be held accountable for all the jobs lost in a severe regional recession. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged fault in several of the cases cited, particularly with respect to Crown Heights. SCORECARD: This tough ad attacks Mr. Dinkins for a range of old and new lapses, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. It is Mr. Giuliani's attempt to counteract the Dinkins ads that have sought to rehash old aspects of his record of service to Republican administrations and link them to his current policy views. Similarly, this ad attempts to paint Mr. Dinkins's entire career as an endless skein of mediocrity and bumbling -- typified by his failure to pay income taxes. The ""You think you'd get away with it?"" line is an indirect echo of a charge the Giuliani camp sometimes makes more overtly: that if Mr. Dinkins were white, he would never have been forgiven such a lapse. That is a way of saying whites need not feel guilty for voting against him now, having given him a break four years ago. By citing the most notable crises of the Dinkins administration, the ad may ring uncomfortably true. But its rapid-fire mix of images and charges, and its final sneering tone of blaming the electorate may also put voters off.<? TODD S. PURDUM",1993-10-15T05:00:00+0000

The next year, 16 vines were sick. The vineyard's owner, John Baritelle, brought an expert on nematodes up to search for the parasitic worms that often transmit disease to grapevines. The nematologist could find no nematodes. Baritelle consulted other specialists. Was it an insect? A virus? A fungus? A drainage problem? A planting error? A soil deficiency? Although myriad misfortunes can afflict a vineyard, the symptoms are unenlighteningly uniform: the vines weaken and die. Diagnosis is a haphazard art and, for the grower, a frustrating one. The mystery was not solved until the summer of 1982, when Austin Goheen, a plant pathologist at the University of California at Davis, dug up a vine on Baritelle's land and saw at once the telltale yellow colonies of tiny aphid-like insects on the roots.

Lloyd of Morris Heights, the Bronx, staggered into the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center nearly comatose, nearly blind and barely able to walk. Doctors discovered he had severe diabetes, which kept him in the hospital for 10 days. But Mr. Lloyd's more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor, which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in New York's poorer neighborhoods turns treatable outpatient diseases into life-threatening conditions. This severe deficit of doctors in poor urban neighborhoods will make President Clinton's health-care plan, or any alternative, difficult to carry out in the areas that most need the help. A1. NEW YORK CITY DIFFERING SHARPLY ON THE ECONOMY As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that mirrors a national debate over economic policy.

The Canadiens avenged a 5-2 loss to Quebec in Montreal last Saturday night. The Montreal victory continued a curious pattern in meetings between the provincial rivals: Dating back to last season, the Canadiens have won the last four games in Quebec, while the Nordiques have won the last four in Montreal. (AP) Red Wings 6, Sabres 4: Shawn Burr scored his first three goals of the season and Ray Sheppard snapped a third-period tie to give Detroit the victory in Buffalo. The Red Wings ended a four-game losing streak, while Buffalo extended its losing streak to six games. For the fifth time in those six losses, the Sabres were tied or ahead going into the final period. Sheppard beat Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek between the legs with a short low shot at 6 minutes 20 seconds of the final period on the power play. (AP) Jets 6, Oilers 3: Kris King scored his first goal of the season early in the third period to put Winnipeg ahead to stay at home.

Edmonton goalie Fred Brathwaite, making his first start, stopped 36 shots while Jets goalie Bob Essensa blocked 23.

us,Playing on Uncertainties About the Health Plan,"SPONSOR: The Coalition for Health Insurance Choices, financed by the Health Insurance Association fo America. ON THE SCREEN: A couple, Harry and Louise, is sitting over breakfast. He is reading a newspaper, she a published version of the President's health care plan. The camera angle changes, and we see the health care plan from above as Louise underlines a passage with a yellow marking pen. At the end of the ad, an 800 number appears along with a tag identifying the sponsors. THE SCRIPT: Harry: ""I'm glad the President's doing something about health care reform.""....Louise: ""He's right. We need it.""... Harry: ""Some of these details--""... Louise: ""Like a national limit on health care?""... Harry: ""Really."" ...Louise: ""The government caps how much the country can spend on all health care and says, 'That's it!""'...Harry: ""So what if our health plan runs out of money?""...Louise: ""There's got to be a better way."" ACCURACY: The implication of the ad is that under the President's plan, only a certain amount of money can be spent on health care, and after that, patients will be out of luck. The President has proposed a complicated set of regulations to limit the rate in increase in health care spending to the inflation rate. Among other things, these regulations would limit the amount that health insurance premiums could rise each year. Many health care providers are concerned that the limits would adversely affect the quality of care and that some health care plans might actually run out of money. The President's proposal also calls for each state to set up contingency funds to bail out insolvent plans. SCORECARD: The ad purports to reflect the concerns of average citizens, and it effectively appeals to a generalized sense that the Clinton Administration's plan doesn't quite add up. But the ad has an melodramatic, overacted quality that may make viewers suspicious. And once they learn the ad is sponsored by the insurance industry, these suspicions are only likely to increase.

The Writing on the Wall","Lee Friedlander has gathered the photographs he has made of letters, numbers and messages he found on walls, windows and pavements in the United States and abroad and published them as LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE (Distributed Arts Publishers, 636 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10012, $95). The contrasting textures, shadings and points of view of the 213 crisp black-and-white photographs arouse much esthetic pleasure. But beyond his delight in form, the photographer seems to have stared at surfaces to capture substances and scrutinized the esthetics of characters for clues about their identities and contexts. Toward the end of the book, Mr. Friedlander, whose previous photography books include ""The Jazz People of New Orleans"" and ""Like a One-Eyed Cat,"" shows complete words and sentences: some graphically advertise the stuff of everyday life (chicken, a shoeshine parlor, books); most express beliefs and yearnings. From a white wall, an elongated black ""Sin"" heckles passers-by; a black-marker diatribe against Ronald Reagan defiles a model's smiling face; messages about love and sex are shouted in spray paint or whispered in tiny scratches. The photographer's homage to human ingenuity of expression is clear. Mr. Friedlander also emphasizes the power and mystery of his symbols. A dark spray-painted ""No,"" surmounted by a question mark and underlined three times, seems to be crying out in anguish -- but about what? To whom? The power and mystery of these images are synthesized in the last photograph in ""Letters From the People,"" of a short love poem inscribed on a railing in Hong Kong: ""Everyday I calls a phone to her. / Every night I dreams for her.""

But others -- Claire McCardell's 1940's sportswear and Norman Norell's glamorous gowns, for example -- transcend time. 40's -- On its own, American fashion emerged triumphant.

A series of hypothetical examples outline the current and projected costs of insurance coverage for a number of families or individuals in varying circumstances. Here are excerpts from the report, with White House's description and cost estimates. TWO-PARENT FAMILY YEARLY COST TO FAMILY NOW: Mary Sampson manages a small law office in San Jose, California. She makes $35,000 a year. Her husband, a minister, makes $30,000 a year. Today, they get their coverage through Mary's employer, who pays half their premium. They pay $2,940 a year, 8 percent of her salary, for their health care premiums alone, not including co-payments and deductibles. CLINTON PLAN: Assuming they choose an average-priced plan, the premium for Mary Sampson and her husband will be around $872 a year, or $73 a month. They could choose a higher cost plan, which would cost them more, or a 1ower cost plan, which would cost them less. COUPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS NOW: Dennis and Barbara Rutherford, who live in Hannibal, Missouri have a combined income of $21,200. Dennis was laid off from his high paying job with a large manufacturing firm in late 1990. At that time, both Rutherfords lost their health care coverage. They have been turned down for other coverage because of preexisting conditions -- Dennis' high blood pressure and Barbara's history of breast cancer.

Fuzz Redux","CHENILLE, THE MEMORY: Chenille is a fuzzy-feely, cozy-cuddly fabric whose very name evokes waves of nostalgia in people old enough to remember Howdy Doody, Alben Barkley and bedspreads with rows and rows of cotton tufts that could be pulled out, systematically, by bored kids until all that was left covering them was a thin cotton rag. Mothers who had made it through World War II had to endure this compulsive behavior in the 1940's and 50's.CHENILLE, THE FASHION PHENOMENON: Sweaters made of another kind of chenille (and we'll get to that shortly) are pouring out of Manhattan stores, enveloping the island in a sea of fuzz. At Barneys New York, where it is possible to spend from $150 to $340 on a chenille sweater, ""chenille's selling faster than anything else,"" said Suzie Welton, a vice president at Barneys. The two Barneys stores together are selling chenille sweaters at a rate of 350 pieces a week. At Eileen Fisher, the rate is an impressive 20 a day per store.WHY NOW: Chenille sweaters are post-modern security blankets, said Valerie Steele, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ""In the old days, you felt secure if you were well dressed,"" she continued. ""Now people are bringing out more eccentric security blankets."" Made by Donna, Ralph or Azzedine.MORE NOSTALGIA: At the Lucy Anna Folk Art and Antique Quilt store in the West Village, Karen Taber is selling a slew of old chenille bedspreads to people who remember playing with toy cars between the tufted lines in their bedspreads.",1993-10-31T05:00:00+0000

It wasn't that I wanted the Koch poem. Not at first. I mean, I didn't ask for it or anything.

The painter also recalled it as a place for making friends, subject to a rite that involved the initiate buying ""a large quantity of beer.""",1993-10-31T05:00:00+0000

A contemporary of Verlaine and Rimbaud, Pierre Loti (the pseudonym of Julien Viaud) was a rakish French author, artist and naval officer whose sensuous travel diary ""The Desert"" was first published in France in 1895. Translated by Jay Paul Minn, it is a bewitching account of Loti's camelback travels from Cairo to Gaza through the Sinai Desert. Loti (1850-1923) was an atheist who embarked on the trip to heal his spirit by following ""old abandoned trails to Holy Jerusalem."" (He covered the Gaza-Jerusalem journey in his next book, ""Jerusalem."") He was often as enthralled with his Bedouin guides in their ""furry rags"" as he was with the sacred landmarks he visited. Similarly, his religious enthusiasm was as much anthropological as spiritual: at a sixth-century Byzantine church, he marvels at the contents of two reliquary chests. One contained ""the mummified black hand of St. Catherine, lying with its rings and bracelets on a silk cushion""; the other, ""her head, crowned with a tiara of precious stones, an awesome relic framed by quilting and smelling of mummy."" On the road, the author and his companions meet bandit sheiks, learn to distrust mirages and suffer an attack of longhaired caterpillars.

us,"UNIVERSITY PRESSES -- IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Rebels With Causes","The writers and revolutionaries who gave Greenwich Village its reputation for bohemianism at the beginning of the century were reformers at heart. Their mission was to make a better world, not better art. As John Reed put it, ""This class struggle plays hell with your poetry."" They found a haven in the Village, a backwater unaffected by the grid system imposed by city planners on the rest of New York. GREENWICH VILLAGE: Culture and Counterculture (Museum of the City of New York/Rutgers University, $29.95), a fine collection of essays and photographs edited by Rick Beard, a former official of the Museum of the City of New York, and Leslie Cohen Berlowitz, director of the Humanities Council of New York University, examines the peculiar confluence of geography and economics that made the American bohemians feel at home. For example, few thoroughfares linked the Village with the business district to the south or with the flourishing shopping district just north; this preserved the neighborhood's intimate quality. As the essayists -- who include Alfred Kazin, Daniel Aaron and Denis Donoghue -- point out, the anonymous rooming houses and studios offered liberation from conventional restraints. Still, personal relations took a back seat to politics. Village residents expressed outrage at the needless deaths in the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire and were early supporters of the suffragettes. After World War I, many of the original Villagers moved on, the artistic types were shrewd entrepreneurs playing to an increasing tourist trade, and the neighborhood's character remained; the Beat Generation writers of the 1950's hung out in the Village for the same reasons John Reed and Emma Goldman had 40 years earlier. The rapture was fading, but the memory is wonderfully preserved in this book.HANNA RUBIN",1993-10-31T05:00:00+0000

Of course, on certain religious feast days one can still find Peruvian Indians in the mountains in just such angel costumes (without the rifles), but their predecessors have been preserved in magnificent paintings, reproduced -- along with an astonishing array of art produced in oil, metals, wood and textiles for 300 years -- in CAMBIOS: The Spirit of Transformation in Spanish Colonial Art (Santa Barbara Museum of Art/University of New Mexico; cloth, $50; paper, $25). Two curators of a show organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Gabrielle Palmer and Donna Pierce, give overviews of art in the Viceroyalty of Peru (all of South America except Brazil) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Central America, Mexico and parts of the United States). But it is the descriptions of individual works that, taken together, fill one with wonder at the lavishness, vitality and great endurance of the artistic genius that flowed through the old Spanish empire, making the gold and gems Europe fought over seem tawdry in comparison. Mexican painters like Juan Correa and Miguel Cabrera certainly knew contemporary European standards, but their work blazes with light, passion and wisdom that express their own visions of the great civilization rising around them. And the anonymous casters and carvers of silver Peruvian incense burners in the forms of turkeys, peacocks and armadillos knew all that Cellini knew, and more. This book is not a heavy history, but a sweet breeze of inspiration that fills one with humility and delight, and perhaps some somber reflection on the blind arrogance of people who refer to these lands now as ""third world.""

None of these elegant-looking books (each one of which costs $65) has ever appeared on a best-seller list; none is likely to turn up on the shelves of your neighborhood bookstore any time soon. Yet some 95,000 individual volumes have been sold since 1966, when the first one appeared. Virtually every American library owns a set, as do hundreds of other libraries around the world (there are at least two sets in Moscow.) Initially subsidized by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, ""The Papers of Woodrow Wilson"" long ago began to turn a handsome profit for Princeton.

At the same time that you are being asked to decide who should spend the next four years in City Hall, you will get to weigh in on whether eight years in office is enough for anyone. If it is approved, ballot proposal No. 4 would force candidates who win on Tuesday and are re-elected in four years to be out by 2001.

But look at it this way, President Clinton said, as he plunked his mammoth health care plan in Congress' lap last week: ""None of us could devise a system more complex, more burdensome, more administratively costly than the one we have now."" He's got a point there. But then again, the present system wasn't built in a day, and he's trying to create a brand new labyrinth in a single stroke. The plan has evolved during its months of gestation, notably in new limits on Government subsidies -- an attempt to allay fears that Big Government will take on an unworkable burden. But for all the talk of his waffling, all the plan's revisions, he's stuck to one razor-sharp goal: ""health care security for all Americans.""",1993-10-31T05:00:00+0000
