In one broad sweep, the union will grow to 450 million people and an economy rivaling the United States in size. There are predictions of chaos. Decision-making, not exactly easy even among the core countries of what has been called old Europe, will get more cumbersome. A flood of migrants could swamp the sluggish Western European job markets. But there is also optimism. The low wages of the East may force countries like Germany and France to overhaul their own economies and loosen up labor rules. That could make Europe more competitive and give it a much-needed shot of self-confidence.",2003-12-01T05:00:00+0000

The European Commission accuses it of antitrust transgressions that warrant tougher remedies.

The medical examiner's office said that the baby girl, who was found at Resurrection Roman Catholic Church in Gerritsen Beach, was a newborn, not a fetus. Under a 2000 law intended to prevent the death of abandoned infants, newborns can be left in a place where they are ''safe from physical injury'' with no questions asked of parents. The Brooklyn district attorney's office has specified hospitals and firehouses as ''safe havens,'' and when the baby was thought to be abandoned, the fact that she was left at a church on Sunday morning, when parishioners could be expected, was a factor in favor of the person who left her. That has changed with the police ruling of homicide. Shaila K. Dewan (NYT)",2003-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing: New York," ALBANY: JUDGE CLEARS HEALTH INSURANCE LAW A state judge has ruled that a new law requiring employers to provide contraception to women as part of health insurance coverage does not violate the free-exercise-of-religion clauses in the state and federal Constitutions. Church groups had challenged the law, saying it forced them to violate their beliefs by providing birth control to employees at hospitals and other institutions with religious affiliations. Dennis Poust, a spokesman for the New York State Catholic Conference, said the plaintiffs would appeal. Justice Dan Lamont of State Supreme Court ruled on Friday that state precedent going back to 1911 held that compelling government interests can permit some infringement on religious practice. The state's interest in providing necessary health care to women, Justice Lamont ruled, outweighed whatever First Amendment burden affected the religious charities. &#0160;&#0160;James C.

In September 2002, the elevated train derailed on a curve during a test run, killing its operator. An investigation said the crash was unrelated to the design and construction of the system. The eight-mile system will connect airport terminals and the airport itself to the transportation hub in downtown Jamaica. The train will operate 24 hours a day and leave every four minutes during peak travel periods. It will also run to the A train at the Howard Beach subway station and to a new terminal in downtown Jamaica. The Howard Beach and Jamaica trips will cost $5 each way.

Yesterday, two SUNY trustees opposed the budget plan: the student trustee, Stephanie Gross, and Candace de Russy, a former educator. SUNY, after eight years without tuition increases, raised tuition 28 percent this year to $4,350 for state students at its senior college. The City University of New York, which also went eight years without a tuition increase, raised tuition this year by 25 percent, to $4,000. On Monday, the CUNY board approved a budget plan seeking $139 million in increased state aid but no tuition increase.

Caparulo and her husband, Steve, make a strong case that it should in their new book, ''Great Dishes From New Jersey's Favorite Restaurants'' (Rutgers University Press, $32.95). The book, a survey of 52 restaurants from Weehawken and points north down to Cape May, includes recipes and tempting photographs taken by Mr. Caparulo. The list tilts toward formal places like the Ryland Inn and the Dining Room at the Short Hills Hilton. Ms. Caparulo, a cooking teacher, has a jokey, exclamatory writing style, calling a chef who likes seafood ''a real afishianado.'' But the recipes are clear and often include chefs' tricks. Many are on the complicated side, requiring special equipment and unusual ingredients like caul fat.

The group also said that the agency had failed to conduct a required environmental impact report. It was the second such legal challenge to the bear hunt, the first sanctioned hunt since 1970. On Monday, animal-welfare groups and others made similar arguments in federal court seeking to exclude a national park along the Delaware River from the hunt. The state's environmental commissioner, Bradley M.

John Windmuller was born on December 4, 1923 in Dortmund, Germany, son of Solomon and Bertha (nee Kahn) Windmuller. He left Germany on a children's transport in December 1938 after having been held for four days by the Gestapo. He was a passenger on the ill-fated voyage of the St. Louis and came to the United States in 1942. He served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, was active in postwar relief work on behalf of children in war-devastated European countries, and graduated with a B.A. degree from the University of Illinois in 1948. He then undertook graduate work in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, receiving a doctoral degree in 1951 when he was appointed to the Cornell faculty. In 1983 he became the first holder of the Martin P. Catherwood Chair in Industrial and Labor Relations, and in 1987 he was named Professor-emeritus. He continued to teach for several years after his retirement. As a teacher, he had the satisfaction of seeing several of his students embark on careers in international industrial relations. Throughout his academic career Professor Windmuller was actively engaged in research, usually on subjects with a significant international or comparative aspect. He took a special interest in the operation of labor organizations, employers associations and collective bargaining systems. He also served on several editorial boards of academic journals and the Cornell University Press. For a book on Labor Relations in the Netherlands (1969) the Dutch government awarded him a medal. For many years, Professor Windmuller contributed to the development of international programs and activities in Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and from 1961 to 1964 he served as its Director of International Activities. He also served as Associate Dean of the School from 1975 to 1977. On two occasions he held senior positions in the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, chiefly to prepare a study of Collective Bargaining in Industrialized Market Economies.

Momentarily freed from the pressure to choose the right pop pose, Whitney Houston can simply bestow her vocal gifts on the familiar songs (plus two inoffensive new ones) that fill her Christmas album. The lavish swoops, the sultry whispers, the gospelly asides and the meteoric crescendos are all applied to songs that are usually arranged with the burnished keyboards and subdued percussion of current R&B. The ballads are impressive, though they can verge on soupy; turning ecumenical, she adds Hanukkah and Kwanzaa to Mel Torm's ''Christmas Song.''

While the proposal for a pair of piers at Battery Park that would be as long as the trade center was tall, was Mr. Bernstein's, it was entered by his domestic partner, Charles Upchurch. Mr. Bernstein submitted a separate proposal in his own name. The Twin Piers entry survived until very late in the judging process but was eliminated after Mr. Bernstein's involvement was discovered by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Mr. Upchurch then sued for reinstatement. Mr. Bernstein said yesterday, ''It would have been good for everyone -- including the jury -- to be able to consider the Twin Piers on their artistic merit, but the L.M.D.C. had other ideas.''",2003-12-05T05:00:00+0000

They're restrained versions of church repertory (''There Is a Balm in Gilead,'' ''Every Time I Feel the Spirit'') as well as stock holiday songs like ''The Little Drummer Boy.'' The album is parked at a lovely midway point between jazz and classical music. BEN RATLIFF",2003-12-05T05:00:00+0000

Nicely packaged, and loosely organized thematically (there's one about the weather outside, a second about the warmth inside and finally a third of Christmas icons), they mix the regular Christmas crooners with less obvious choices that should be classics. What results is a CD not just for arch-eyebrowed purveyors of cocktail music but also for Christmas-pop traditionalists looking to expand their horizons. Included are Rosemary Clooney, Ella Fitzgerald, Artie Shaw, Sergio Mendes, Booker T. and the MG's, and Claudine Longet, whose fantastic ''Snow'' makes me wonder why I've never seen a collection of 1960's French Christmas chansons.

Television, the band that put CBGB on the map in the mid-1970's, was less a punk band than what would now be called a jam band. But it was a New York jam band, barbed and dark and deliberately astringent. Its late-1970's studio albums were showcases for Tom Verlaine's songs and were constrained by the length of the LP. Now that Television's first albums have been reissued, this live set reveals what was missing: the constant, peripatetic interplay of Mr. Verlaine and Richard Lloyd on guitar and the dynamics of a rhythm section that brought jazz subtlety to basic, two-chord rock. The sound is pristine, illuminating each quietly picked harmonic or distorted squall from a band whose improvisations were tightrope-walking marathons. JON PARELES",2003-12-05T05:00:00+0000

With all the songwriters in Nashville, one would think there'd be more original Christmas fare coming from country artists. Mr. Chesney's holiday CD is a centerpiece for the title song, about getting away from the snow and to the Caribbean. It's enough to make Jimmy Buffett jealous. There's plenty of filler, throwaways and sap here, and many of the elements that make Mr. Chesney stand out from his contemporaries are neutered. But there are two worthwhile duets, ''Christmas in Dixie'' with Randy Owen and ''Pretty Paper'' with Willie Nelson. NEIL STRAUSS",2003-12-05T05:00:00+0000

The discs contain some of the best jazz and R&B of the time, including Johnny Otis and his Orchestra, Slim Gaillard, Charlie Parker, Erroll Garner, Helen Humes and Big Jay McNeely; the purview of the label incorporated bebop's subtleties but tended more toward frantic good times.

This anthology focuses on the exquisite soul songs Mr. Pendergrass recorded for Philadelphia International Records from 1976, when he left Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, to 1982, when his career was interrupted by a car crash. On these recordings, Mr. Pendergrass sounds equally smooth (and, when necessary, gruff) whether accompanied by an orchestra, a funk band or a synthesizer, and sometimes, as on ''I Can't Win for Losing,'' he's accompanied by all three. On ''Close the Door,'' a silky Gamble and Huff production, Mr. Pendergrass punctuates his pleadings with a shouted invitaion: ''Come here, woman!'' This is singleminded music, but it's also surprisingly versatile: some listeners will hear a great singer navigating the transition from soul to disco to 1980's R&B; others, no doubt, will be content merely to act out the lyrics.

Her reversal drew criticism from human rights groups. The death penalty was removed from the Constitution in 1987 but a series of sensational crimes in 1992 prompted Congress to reinstate it in 1993. Executions started in 1998, but President Joseph Estrada stopped executions in January 2001. By then, only seven of more than a thousand convicts on death row had been executed. Carlos H.

Toward the end of the tournament, a friend finally took her aside, and now Mariann flies into their room in a fury, brandishing a fly swatter.

For three decades, to the astonishment of foreigners, the crown had been wrestled back and forth between the Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry V, the glory of Lancaster and the victor of Agincourt, had been followed in 1422 by a child-king, Henry VI, who grew into a saintly fool at the mercy of his scheming lords. England quickly descended into factional warfare, with extraordinary slaughter of the nobility on both sides. In 1460 Richard, Duke of York, claiming descent from Edward III, tried to proclaim himself king but was rebuffed and, in short order, killed. The next year, his son defeated Henry in battle and was crowned as Edward IV at Westminster. ",2003-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,PHOTOGRAPHY,"There's a theological bent to this season's books of and about photographs, as some of the titles reviewed below attest: ''Revelation'' (singular), ''Revelations'' (plural), ''The Passions,'' ''The Devil's Playground.'' But big biblical themes like temptation, renunciation, redemption and grace can also be found in unexpected places, like ''One Big Self,'' a startling collection of portraits of convicted felons in a Louisiana prison, and ''What Remains,'' Sally Mann's new book of freighted landscapes and portraits of the dead. (These, too, are reviewed below.) Another sign of the times is a wealth of photographic literature, from collections of essays by the curator David Travis (''At the Edge of the Light,'' published by David R. Godine) and the critic David Levi Strauss (''Between the Eyes,'' published by Aperture) to attempts to write the recent history of photography as an art (David Campany's ''Art and Photography,'' from Phaidon, and the Tate Modern's catalog to last summer's mega-show, ''Cruel and Tender''). Equally literary, though less easy to pigeonhole, is ''The Montesi Scandal'' (University of Chicago), Karen Pinkus's captivating account -- in quasi-screenplay form -- of the moment in postwar Italy when politics, cinema and paparazzi photography coalesced into a single culture. Could moths, too, be a trend?

The 250-year-old library, in Providence, had expected to raise as much as $7 million from the sale, but dozens of people who use the library protested and took the matter to court. The suit delayed the sale until February, when the case is scheduled to be heard. Jonathan Bengtson, a specialist in medieval history who became the library's executive director late in 2001, sent a letter of resignation to the board on Nov. 23, and the board accepted it on Friday. In his letter Mr. Bengtson cited ''lingering elitism among a small, but active, group of individuals'' whose ''disdain for those who seek to secure the institution's survival seems to know no bounds.'' He pledged to stay on through mid-February to help with the litigation and said that he intended then to take a job as chief librarian of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto.

The Legislature voted Monday night along party lines &#0151; 11 Democrats to 6 Republicans &#0151; to approve a $1.4 billion budget that assumes the State Legislature will permit a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax rise in the county. They acted despite a warning from Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, who told them before they voted that the sales tax was ""off the table."" The budget, which County Executive Andrew Spano said he would sign, would raise property taxes by about 8.5 percent. To protect the county from financial problems that would occur by mid-February if the sales tax failed, nine of the Democrats signed a letter promising to raise property taxes an additional 12.4 percent and cut spending by $20.6 million &#0151; bringing back the layoffs Mr. Spano had proposed. &#0160;&#0160;(AP) ",2003-12-10T05:00:00+0000

It said Ron Smith, 53, a senior vice president who was head of its wireless business, would retire early next year. His unit will be merged with one that builds chips for networking and communications gear, Intel said. Sean Maloney, 47, who runs the communications group, will lead the new unit. Intel needs to cut costs in the wireless business and to persuade cellphone clients to switch from chips by the industry leader Texas Instruments. Intel said last week that it would write down a wireless acquisition by $600 million, prompting concern that Intel was missing out as the cellphone market surges. In the company's most recent quarter, sales in the wireless unit fell 23 percent to $450 million, while revenue from communications chips increased 13 percent to $544 million. Mr. Smith has been with Intel 26 years and helped develop its early processors and its effort in flash-memory chips.

Few actual buildings were realized, but the ideas generated about the politics, economics and environmental impact of architecture still reverberate.",2003-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Jim Guy Tucker had been indicted by Whitewater prosecutors under an outdated statute, the federal judge who had ordered him to pay $1 million in back taxes reduced that figure to $63,000. Even the smaller amount is subject to reduction or elimination, the judge said. Mr. Tucker pleaded guilty in 1998 to charges of arranging a sham bankruptcy to evade taxes on the sale of a business. The case now returns to a federal appellate court. Mr. Tucker resigned in 1996 after his conviction in a second Whitewater-related case. Steve Barnes (NYT) ",2003-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Sales rose 22 percent to $358.6 million from $294.7 million, the company reported after markets closed yesterday. Sales have climbed for five consecutive quarters, and net income has increased for six. Advertising companies, who use Adobe's software to design their campaigns, said ad spending might increase 6.9 percent in 2004, spurred in part by marketing related to the Summer Olympics; that would be the biggest jump since 2001. In last year's fourth quarter, Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., said advertisers spent no money on new software. In after-hours trading, shares of Adobe rose as much as $2.31, to $42.09.

Without taking sides in the Damadian controversy with the Nobel Committee, I am positive that Dr. Damadian's publications were a major factor in his being denied a part of the prize. Although Dr. Damadian's paper was published before Dr. Lauterbur's, this may not be significant because many world-class journals have delay periods of two or more years between the time the manuscript is received and the time it is published in the journal. These long delays are due to slow referees returning papers with their critical comments, and the additional time it may take for the authors to make the appropriate revisions.",2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000

In the 1970's and 80's, legions of students and professors in humanities departments embraced the view that the world was a ''text'' -- that the personal and political were shaped by language and that literary and cultural critics possessed tools as powerful as those of, say, political scientists for understanding the world and effecting social change.

''Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff,'' he observes, and the movie, which came out in August, takes this statement as both its theme and its organizing principle. As fans of the comic book from which the film takes its title will know, Harvey Pekar is a real person, and he appears in the movie not only in the rumpled, jowly form of Giamatti but also in his own unremarkable skin. Giamatti's Pekar ambles through the real streets of Cleveland, while Pekar's Pekar shows up from time to time, posed against a blank white background that suggests an uninked comic-book page.

The actor Patrick Dempsey played Ronald Miller, a senior class nobody whose Saturday nights revolve around ''chips, dips and dorks.'' When Ronald pays the prettiest cheerleader in school to be his girlfriend, he suddenly rises from ''totally geek to totally chic.'' And then the discovery of the ruse and the inevitable downfall. What's unexpected is what has happened to Ronald 16 years later.

us,Alfred Kazins America," In Brownsville tenements the kitchen is always the largest room and the center of the household. As a child I felt that we lived in a kitchen to which four other rooms were annexed. My mother, a ""home"" dressmaker, had her workshop in the kitchen. She told me once that she had begun dressmaking in Poland at thirteen; as far back as I can remember, she was always making dresses for the local women. She had an innate sense of design, a quick eye for all the subtleties in the latest fashions, even when she despised them, and great boldness. For three or four dollars she would study the fashion magazines with a customer, go with the customer to the remnants store on Belmont Avenue to pick out the material, argue the owner down - all remnants stores, for some reason, were supposed to be shady, as if the owners dealt in stolen goods - and then for days would patiently fit and baste and sew and fit again. Our apartment was always full of women in their housedresses sitting around the kitchen table waiting for a fitting. My little bedroom next to the kitchen was the fitting room. The sewing machine, an old nut-brown Singer with golden scrolls painted along the black arm and engraved along the two tiers of little drawers massed with needles and thread on each side of the treadle, stood next to the window and the great coal-black stove which up to my last year in college was our main source of heat. By December the two outer bed-rooms were closed off, and used to chill bottles of milk and cream, cold borscht, and jellied calves' feet. ",2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000

In the time since, a coterie of ''network thinkers'' have begun to extend the language of the network -- ''nodes'' and ''hubs'' and ''links'' -- to phenomena ranging from the workings of the world economy to the possible spread of a dangerous pathogen. Several network theorists, most notably Albert-Laszlo Barabasi of Notre Dame and Duncan Watts of Columbia, have recently discovered that varieties of systems display a common architecture that governs their dynamics and structure. The way a cluster of neurons fires, for instance, has marked similarities to the way a disease like SARS travels the globe or the way a contagious idea disperses.

us,QUICK BITE/Glassboro; Charms 101,"To Margie and Ted Tannenbaum, retired Rowan University professors, it takes more than a college and a town to make a college town. In a real college town, campus life spills out into the streets. Students gather at local haunts to chat, hang out and study over steaming mugs of coffee. Downtown Glassboro, pitted with vacant storefronts, offers few of these charms. So, last April the Tannenbaums opened the town's first real coffee shop: Eleven East Cafe. Now it is a favorite among Rowan students and locals alike, who stop in to lounge on overstuffed vintage furniture while drinking lattes ($2.25 and $2.75) or specialty concoctions like mango vanilla iced tea with raspberry syrup ($2). Snacks include bagels, pretzels dipped in chocolate (85 cents each, or two for $1.50) and organic, vegan treats baked by the Tannenbaums' daughter, Jessica, that taste surprisingly good in spite of their wholesomeness. These include a rich orange cinnamon biscotti ($1.25) and the buzz bar ($2.25), with dense layers of chocolate, peanut butter and raspberry jam beneath a cashew crust. If you're not part of the study crowd, you can peruse the work of local artists on the walls or pull a magazine from the coffee table heap. A back room offers more seating and a charmingly haphazard array of board games and books from the Evergreen, a used bookstore next door, which the Tannenbaums also own. If you like your coffee with a collegiate, Vermont-style ambience, you will sing the cafe's praises. And if you want to sing them in front of an audience, you can: Friday and Saturday are open-mike nights. Jessica Bruder",2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000

An interlude on a pirate ship was added and Hook (''O man unfathomable,'' wrote his creator) was born. An expert dramatist like Barrie, already rich from a string of hit plays and books, knew his yarn needed a bad guy, but he thought he already had one: Peter himself. Birkin writes that among the over 700 notes for ''Peter Pan'' discovered in the 1980's was one reading ''P. a demon boy (villain of story).''",2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000

After not paying the government for seven years, he amassed a $27,000 debt that ballooned to $80,000 because of penalties, interest payments and an expensive bill from a holistic tax attorney/therapist.

us,Players Without a Program,"Hollywood always prefers its fiction  clef, so if there's a vaguely gossipy quality to DANGEROUS COMPANY: Dark Tales From Tinseltown (Miramax, $22.95), Peter Bart's collection of interrelated short stories, that just means the author knows his target demo. As editor in chief of Variety, the entertainment industry's most influential trade publication, Bart makes friends and enemies in roughly equal measure; before taking over the magazine, he was a studio executive at Paramount and MGM. Having achieved a unique kind of power -- in Hollywood, headlines from the trades often carry the weight of papal bulls -- Bart is beyond using mere fiction to settle scores or curry favor. Indeed, his mission here at times seems more akin to earnest undergraduate crusading than Tinseltown dishing. Several stories explore issues of ageism, lookism and homophobia among writers, actors and producers; another story argues intelligently for a reconsideration of the ratings system by which mature sexual content automatically condemns certain motion pictures to art-house obscurity. Too often, though, these stories have the cursory feel of a pitch made over the last bites of dessert at Orso. At the heart of ''Friend of the Family,'' in which a dueling producer and director finally discover a compelling reason to cooperate, is little more than a third-act plot twist dressed up as emotional conflict. And the unifying conceit of Bart's stories -- that all the characters either live on or frequent an exclusive street in the Hollywood Hills -- would be more at home in a nighttime soap opera than serious fiction. Still, it's fun to play along and guess which real-life figures Bart has in mind as he editorializes about all that's venal and vicious in the city whose rules he helped draft.

us,"Greek Gods, Human Lives"," The ancient Greeks did not have a sacred text like the Bible. No one decided what versions of the myths were authoritative. Authors were free to tell the stories as they chose, with their own emphasis, provided they preserved the principal characters and basic plots. The Greeks learned about the gods from poetry written in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., the most important and influential of which, Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days , and the great epics attributed to Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey , still survive. Hesiod's poem Theogony offers an account of the beginnings of the world and a genealogy of the gods, detailing their names and how they are related to one another. At the same time, it explains why, in a world with so many different gods, the lives of humankind are dominated by a particular family of gods on Mount Olympus, the head of which is Zeus. Hesiod describes how Zeus came to be the most important god and shows why it is better for the world as a whole that Zeus (rather than his predecessors) is in charge. Hesiod's Works and Days tells myths that explain why Zeus has made life hard for humans and why they must work to survive while the gods live at their ease, free from cares.

The idea was to find an efficient way of collecting a wide range of expert opinion about threats to national security. To do this, the Pentagon created a futures market -- a cross between a betting pool and a stock market -- in which government officials and other experts would buy and sell ''assets,'' or futures, linked to developments in the Middle East. An asset might be, say, an imminent terrorist attack in Jordan. If experts believed that such an event was likely, they'd snatch up the asset, and its value would rise. Though individual investors would stand to benefit, the real beneficiary would be U.S. policy makers, who'd get otherwise diffuse opinion distilled into a single, easy-to-interpret number: the price of a future.",2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000

BMC plans to keep 200 workers at Magic Solutions, which is based in Plano, Tex., and makes software used to log and answer customer calls. Network Solutions also makes McAfee and Sniffer computer-security programs. The deal will close in the first quarter, Network Associates said. BMC aims to take sales from companies including Computer Associates International and Peregrine Systems by acquiring Magic Solutions, which has about 4,000 clients, a BMC spokesman, Arch Currid, said.

Critics of the plan to reassign 22 of the 50 elevator operators said more, not fewer, operators are needed, especially in the evening. The M.T.A. votes on the plan tomorrow. Around 10:15 p.m Monday, the 20-year-old man, whose name was not immediately released, was stabbed once in the stomach. Witnesses described the attackers as a man and a boy, about 22 and 14, who attacked the man on the platform for the No. 1 train. The victim was listed in stable condition at Harlem Hospital. Three elevator operators work at the station in Washington Heights, but two leave during the overnight hours. A spokesman for New York City Transit said the number of operators at the time of the attack, one, would have been the same under the old plan and the proposed new one.

She was an inspiration to all who knew her and countless others who were afflicted with ALS and other neurological disorders. Jenifer's dream was that, someday, there would be a cure for ALS and the related diseases of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's. She devoted her energy to making that dream a reality. She knew that progress in finding a cure would take years and would likely come too late for her. Her wish was that Project A.L.S. would go on and that all of us would fight this disease for years to come until a cure is found. To the thousands of Project A.L.S. supporters, we pledge to honor Jenifer by continuing the fight to find a cure for this dreaded disease.

Sales at Target had cut attendance at Tupperware parties, where independent representatives have sold the products since the 1950's.

Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., said it planned to gather customer feedback from the site in the next few months, make changes, and ''officially launch the service'' next spring. The service, called Music Downloads, is available at www.walmart.com. Competitors, including iTunes and Napster, offer song downloads for 99 cents. The move mimics Wal-Mart's entry into the business of renting DVD's by mail, when it cut prices to draw customers away from rivals like Netflix. Wal-Mart is seeking a foothold in online music as downloading is blamed for the declining sales of CD's. Global music sales fell 11 percent, to $12.7 billion, in the first half of this year, after declining 7 percent last year and 6 percent in 2001, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group. Shares of Wal-Mart rose 70 cents, to $52.60. The market for legally downloaded music will be $35 million this year, a fraction of annual music sales, said David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Research, a technology research firm.

''I wish I could say I have a job,'' Mr. Villalba, 42, a former systems technician for the BellSouth Corporation's Argentine unit, said during a demonstration by unemployed people in Buenos Aires last week. President Nestor Kirchner's government says the 150 pesos ($51) it gives Mr. Villalba each month is the equivalent of collecting a paycheck for a job. Mr. Villalba, who has been out of work for two years, has received the payments for about six months. Such handouts helped drive down the jobless rate to a four-year low of 14.3 percent in the third quarter from a record 21.5 percent in May 2002, the government said yesterday. Argentina's actual unemployment rate, counting those receiving government handouts, is still above 16 percent, said Pablo Morra, an economist at Goldman Sachs & Company in New York.",2003-12-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Kelis Question: Appealing, Appalling Or Simply Addictive?","BABY DODDS -- If you want to smell the subsoil of American music, try an arresting documentary record from 1946, reissued by Atavistic: ''Talking and Drum Solos,'' by the drummer Baby Dodds. (This single disc also includes ''Country Brass Bands,'' an LP from 1954.) Recorded by the jazz historian Frederic Ramsey Jr., Dodds's original 10-inch EP offered his answers to a series of probing questions. What did drumming sound like before all this bebop existed? What exactly did you play in King Oliver's band, in Louis Armstrong's Hot Seven? What did those rhythms sound like, abstracted from the rest of the band? Dodds, who helped invent jazz drumming before there were such things as hi-hat or ride cymbals, demonstrates his rim-tapping and press-rolls, his playing tom-toms, woodblocks and bells, all amounting to a delicate science. And he goes further, constructing several ad-libbed solo performances, which he called ''Spooky Drums,'' Parts 1 and 2. They are among the great solo performances in jazz, and it would have required a leap of imagination by Dodds to consider them performances as such, since they were recorded more than 20 years before drummers played alone on stages.",2003-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Monster Mash,"The Mummy, Dracula and the Wolf Man -- the gang's all here in HOLLYWOOD HORROR: From Gothic to Cosmic (Abrams, $45), Mark A. Vieira's delectably gruesome, if arbitrarily organized, compendium of fright flicks from classic Lon Chaney silents to drive-in fodder like the remarkably unscary Roger Corman cheapie ''The Terror,'' starring a wooden young Jack Nicholson. The book brings well-deserved attention to makeup artists like Jack Pierce, the genius behind the bucket-headed horror of Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy's moldy visage and the beehive for the Bride of Frankenstein. Vieira, who wrote ''Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits,'' also details the work of set designers like Charles Hall, who created the multistoried mad scientist's laboratory in ''Bride of Frankenstein,'' and Jack Otterson, who created the nutty Expressionist angles for ''Son of Frankenstein.'' The book makes a case that moodily lighted black-and-white portraits and production stills are an art form, but Vieira's argument dissolves into pure camp when he includes schlock like ''Monster on the Campus,'' in which the beast-man is seen to be wearing short-sleeve body fur with gloves. Films like Robert Aldrich's ''Kiss Me Deadly'' and Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are shoehorned into the horror genre. Real Hollywood horrors like a washed-up Bela Lugosi cruising Beverly Hills funeral homes for a fix of paraldehyde with the no-budget director Ed Wood Jr. are lightly touched upon. Vieira's book is a nostalgic look back at a kinder, gentler era of monster-movie making. Eric P. Nash",2003-12-21T05:00:00+0000

Far from it: Massey, 39, directed one of the most extensive and notorious identity-theft rings prosecuted so far by federal authorities. By the time investigators broke the case, Massey and his partner in crime, a computer whiz named Kari Melton, had ruined hundreds of people's credit.

us,The Soul of Capitalism," First, we pause to acknowledge the ancestors. The discontents of present day American life are real enough but can seem quite trivial and self-indulgent when laid alongside the American past. Modern pressures lack the hard and often tragic bite of what earlier Americans commonly endured. Three or four generations ago most Americans lived in dwellings that lacked indoor plumbing, not to mention electricity and central heating. Most families were tenants, not owners. Life was simpler, certainly, but also much shorter. Half of the children born in 1900 were dead by the age 40 (in our time, 95 percent of the new babies will live to 40 and half will be still alive at 79). People, it is said, were more God-fearing in olden days, and probably so, since their lives were ruled by stark, random insecurities that dwarf our own: bad weather that could destroy livelihoods or abrupt waves of economic disorder; unspeakably harsh working conditions and inadequate incomes; the blind cruelties of uncontrollable diseases. Parents regularly experienced the sudden death of small children, an event that no doubt encouraged faith in an afterlife, the promise of a heavenly reward. ",2003-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   COULSTON, DR. FREDERICK","COULSTON--Dr. Frederick. 89, of Alamogordo, NM, died Monday, December 15, 2003, in Alamogordo. Dr. Coulston was born December 4, 1914 in New York City to Samuel and Celia Goldstein. He attended Syracuse University where he received his Bachelor's Degree in 1936, his Master's Degree in 1939, and his Doctorate in 1942. During WWII, he was active in the Human Malaria Project, a research program to discover new drugs for malaria. He developed and taught the concept that the malaria parasite acted on the host through its chemical action, both pharmacologically and toxicologically, and the host in turn acted upon the parasite through humoral and immunological mechanisms. This was the beginning of his introduction into modern toxicology. Dr. Coulston had a long, awardwinning career, including Director of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology at the Steeling-Winthrop Research Institute. For the Albany Medical College he served as Director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology, Professor of Pathology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Director of the Animal Research facilities, and assisted in the development of the first hepatitis vaccine. He founded and served as Chairman of Coulston International Corporation and Coulston Products, Inc. which developed and marketed Permanone, used during Operation Desert Storm by the U.S. military. He served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Coulston Foundation which performed research on HIV, various vaccines and hepatitis C. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Diagnostic and Technology Center, Inc. Dr. Coulston was a unique individual who believed strongly in education and was continuously teaching people to the very end of his life. He taught many of today's scientists in the fields of toxicology, parasitology and pharmacology. He was a man with many, many accomplishments, honors and awards, but foremost a dedicated scientist. Through his research work, Dr. Coulston has touched the lives of many human beings throughout the world. He dedicated his life to the health of mankind. He published countless scientific articles and was editor for several scientific journals. His many professional honors included Co-Founder and President of the Society of Toxicology; member of the World Health Organization; member of the International Atomic Agency Commission of the United Nations; President of the International Society of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety; co-Chairman of the Human Health Aspects to Accidental Chemical Exposure of Dioxins; recipient of the Arnold J. Lehman Award; President of the International Society of Regulary Toxicology and Pharmacology; co-author and sponsor of banning cyanide gold processing; and recipient of Businessman of the Year in 2002, given by President George W. Bush. Survivors include his son, Craig Wynn Coulston of Tularosa; his daughter, Cynthia Ann Oxley and her husband Lloyd of Dallas; two grandchildren, Eileen Marie Coker and her husband Christopher of Garland, Texas, and Michael Lloyd Oxley of Dallas; and two very special friends, Robbie Kayhart and Mary Villegas of Alamogordo.

Despite his diminutive stature, brave Antonio secures a job swabbing the decks of a ship, serving as the lookout on a train and taming a huge wild horse, his small, determined song carrying him ever closer to the only place he wants to be: ''I'm on the way home! . . .

On Monday, a former Hudson County Freeholder, Nidia Dvila-Coln, was sentenced last week to 37 months in jail for a bribery conviction, and a former Asbury Park mayor, Kenneth Saunders, and his political advisor, Rayfield James, were convicted of trying to bribe a former city councilwoman. In both cases, law enforcement officials had principals in the bribery cases secretly tape the politicians. Then on Tuesday, the former president of the Camden City Council, James R. Mathes Jr., was sentenced to 27 months in prison and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine in an investigation of Camden city government that had put former Mayor Milton Milan in prison. Mr. Mathes was convicted of accepting a diamond ring for a girlfriend from a jeweler selected by a Philadelphia mobster in the hope that he could then steer city contracts toward his associates. Ms. Davila-Coln, who had served 19 years on the Hudson County freeholder board, was sentenced for her May conviction in federal District Court of carrying cash from her boyfriend, Oscar Sandoval, to the Hudson County executive, Robert Janiszewski, in 1999 as payoffs for contracts. As for the Asbury Park officials, Mr. Saunders and Mr. James were convicted by a federal jury of bribing former City Councilwoman Sheila Solomon to get her vote for contracts on the city's waterfront development in 2000. Sentencing for Mr. Saunders and Mr. James has not been set, and the two men are deciding whether to appeal their cases. Robert Strauss",2003-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,A Talk With the Ghost Of Top-10 Lists Future,"IT is traditional, in the waning weeks of the year, for movie critics to look backward, sorting out the accomplishments and disappointments of the previous 12 months and noting the results on awards ballots and 10-best lists. (The results of that fretful and mysterious process will be published in this section next Sunday.) At a time when the annual tally of theatrical movie releases hovers around 500, and when every town with a population over that number seems to have its own film festival, those lists and prizes can seem downright stingy. Worse, they usually fail to capture some of the keenest excitement of the critic's job, which is the discovery of promising work by actors and filmmakers, young and not so young, at early stages of their careers. Think of this column, a partial roster of such work, not only as yet another end-of-the-year movie retrospective, but as an exercise in divination, a hopeful prophecy of the 10-best lists and Oscar tip-sheets of the future, and of reasons to keep going to the movies in years to come.",2003-12-21T05:00:00+0000

Although ''Oz'' was panned by critics when it opened in October, Mr. Jackman received some of the season's most enthusiastic reviews, and the show, a biography of the Australian entertainer and songwriter Peter Allen, has been playing to full houses at the Imperial Theater. Cancellations of this sort are rare on Broadway. Even when stars like Nathan Lane in ''The Producers'' and Bernadette Peters in ''Gypsy'' were forced out by ailments, they were replaced by understudies. Mr. Jackman has an understudy, Kevin Spirtas, but the producers decided that replacing Mr. Jackman would so disappoint members of the audience that many would demand a refund. A spokesman for the show said, ''Due to the brevity of the breaks, the producers feel that it is not practical or feasible to bring in a star replacement.'' Performances will be canceled on Feb. 1, Feb. 3 to Feb. 6, March 28 and March 30 to April 2. To compensate for some of the lost shows, two have been added, on Jan. 26 and March 22.

Northwest, which is based in St. Paul, is seeking to spread the payments over five years, instead of the normal 18-month period. Northwest said rescheduling the payments was part of its plan to preserve cash and manage costs. The carrier has had losses of $1.34 billion since 2000 because of an industrywide slump and increased competition from discount carriers. The amounts due for the pension plans will not be final until early 2004 and could change depending on the level of investment returns and interest rates in the rest of 2003, Mr. Ebenhoch said.

She is survived by her father Paul Greenberg, her best friend and husband Fred and their four children, Lauren 14, Amanda 12, Jake 10 and Will 5. Jill was the daughter of the late Lenore Greenberg and sister to the late Gwen Greenberg. All three of these incredible women were tragically taken from us in an automobile accident near Akumal, Mexico on Saturday, December 20th. Jill lived with her family in Westchester County. She found a passion for horses when she was 8 years old and competed in the Hunter Class into her early adulthood. Jill's equestrian skills qualified her to show at the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden. She graduated from the University of Virginia with a major in history and started her career at a law firm in Manhattan. She went on to work in commercial real estate at Integrated Resources. She met her soul-mate, Fred, at a Halloween party in the city and they were married two years later on Halloween day. She gave up real estate several years later to pursue her life's work as the devoted mother of her four children. In 1992, Fred and Jill moved to the Village of Larchmont in Westchester County. They soon became a moving force for the community. Jill's extensive involvement in Larchmont included being the Commissioner of the Girls' Junior Soccer League and a number of important fundraising efforts. Virtually every aspect of the community was touched by her contribution. Being a full-time mother to her four wonderful children in no way diminished her willingness to give of herself in her signature calming, self-possessed, effective and intelligent manner. She had a quiet but powerful way of bringing out the best in those around her. Our hearts are broken. Services Friday, December 26th, 10 A.M., at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, Larchmont, NY 10538.",2003-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Using the argot of rap, he calls himself Chubby C for the new song, ''Limbo Rock (Remixes),'' and calls his band Chubby C &OD, featuring Inner Circle. OD is a hip-hop trio; Inner Circle is a veteran Jamaican reggae outfit best known for the omnipresent ''Bad Boys,'' the theme song of the syndicated cinma vrit television show ''Cops.'' Although ''Limbo Rock (Remixes)'' slipped this week to No. 6, the Dec. 20 issue of Billboard listed it at No. 3 on its hot dance singles sales chart, making it Mr. Checker's first top-five hit since the original ''Limbo Rock'' in 1962. The new hit has only reinforced the confidence that Mr. Checker, a longtime Philadelphia-area resident, has in his upbeat, family-friendly stage act.

Total debt is expected to drop to $12.5 billion this year and $10.6 billion in 2004, from $15.7 billion in 2002, Moody's said. Equipment revenue will continue to rise and will help increase sales of ink, paper and other products and services, the ratings agency said. The chief executive of Xerox, Anne M. Mulcahy, has reduced costs and introduced lower-priced products to regain sales lost to rivals like Canon Inc. and the Ricoh Company. Xerox is expected to continue to use cash flow for debt reduction, Moody's said. Moody's has a B1 rating on Xerox debt.

On Dec. 4, the Defense Department approved development and demonstration of the multiplatform radar technology insertion program, said Chuck Paone, a spokesman for the Air Force Electronic Systems Center, which oversees the program. The project will run from 2004 through 2010, he said. The new radar is intended to replace Northrop's joint surveillance target attack radar system, which was used in Kuwait, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. That system can track only ground targets. Northrop received a $303 million design contract for the radar in 2000. The radar will be installed on Northrop's Global Hawk unmanned spy plane, and a larger version will go on a manned aircraft for surveillance of wider areas, Mr. Paone said.

ALERT,"Shares of Biopure, which is developing a human-blood substitute, fell about 14 percent yesterday after the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that it might take action against the company. The company said Wednesday after United States markets closed that it received a so-called Wells notice from the S.E.C. The document is an alert that S.E.C. staff members might recommend charges against a company and gives the company a final opportunity to argue its case. The company said the S.E.C. inquiry probably involved talks with the Food and Drug Administration about testing Biopure's experimental blood substitute, Hemopure, in trauma patients. Biopure had said it expected approval in August for use in orthopedic surgery patients. Biopure will respond ''promptly and thoroughly'' to the notice, said a spokesman, Douglas Sayles. The company said it did not disclose communications with the F.D.A. because it did not believe that they were material. With approval, Hemopure would be first human-blood substitute available in the United States. The product acts like red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the body. Unlike donated blood, Hemopure does not have to be matched to a patient's blood type. Shares of Biopure fell 39 cents, to $2.43.",2003-12-27T05:00:00+0000

Genentech and the Celltech Group of Britain reached a confidential agreement in 2001 to end a dispute over whose scientists first created the method of manufacturing combined human and nonhuman genes. MedImmune sued earlier this year, claiming the companies were wrongly using that agreement to demand royalties from competitors. Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Federal District Court in Los Angeles ruled that there was no antitrust violation because a federal judge approved the agreement. The patent that is the subject of the dispute was issued under rules set by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, she said. ''This is not a case of an anticompetitive private agreement receiving immunity because it passed through government hands in some ministerial way,'' Judge Pfaelzer wrote in her decision issued on Wednesday.

us,Follow That Nun!,"Sam Gamett, the protagonist of Jim Kokoris's novel SISTER NORTH (St. Martin's, $23.95), is a Chicago lawyer who doesn't like the inspirational knickknacks that Maureen, his assistant, keeps giving him. What does she think he's going to do with a framed photograph of a nun on a bicycle? Sam doesn't know -- or care -- that the woman in the picture is Sister Maria North, the nun with the popular television show, or that Maureen is a dedicated fan. It all begins to matter deeply, however, after a crazed client walks into Sam's office, pulls a gun on him and blows Maureen away instead. Sister North's nighttime show becomes Sam's salvation. He has to meet her -- and drives all the way from Chicago to Lake Eagleton, Wis., only to arrive in a cross between a tourist trap and a necropolis. But Sister North has mysteriously vanished (her show is in long-term reruns), and Sam's hope crashes. He wants to know why he's still alive, and he thinks only she can tell him. Jim Kokoris's characters, and scenes set in Midwestern bars and buses and restaurants, would do Tom Waits proud. Everyone's made desperate by the waiting, including us. But there is a payoff. When Sister North does finally reappear, her answer to Sam's existential question is unexpected, hilarious and more than worth the trip. Sally Eckhoff",2003-12-28T05:00:00+0000

us,THE YEAR IN PICTURES: NEW YORK,"NEW YORK had an odd year, and residents can be forgiven if they felt washed up or left in the dark at times. Record rainfall drenched the region in the spring, bringing gloom but proving a boon to foliage. The country's biggest power failure left the area without lights for a couple of days in August, but the relative calm showed how far New York City had come in the quarter-century since its last blackout. Broadway musicals were dark for four days in March during a musicians' strike, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg helped resolve. But the mayor's popularity dropped, and his proposal to eliminate partisan elections for city offices failed miserably at the polls. In July, Councilman James E. Davis, who had crusaded against violence, was assassinated at City Hall by a political rival. A Staten Island Ferry boat crashed in October, killing 11 and raising questions about the ferry's operation. In September, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard A. Grasso, resigned amid criticism of his pay package. In sports, Roger Clemens retired from the Yankees after becoming a 300-game winner. And Jim Fassel was fired as head coach of the Giants after a disappointing season. In a sign that the city is constantly rejuvenating, the design of the first tower at the World Trade Center was unveiled this month. ''This is not just a building,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said of the 1,776-foot structure. ''This is a symbol of New York. This is a symbol of America. This is a symbol of freedom.''",2003-12-29T05:00:00+0000

Fujian Asia Bank is one of seven domestic-foreign joint venture banks that China created in 1993 in an experiment that has since been overtaken by Beijing's decision to allow foreign banks to acquire larger stakes in existing domestic banks.

In 2000, worldwide chip sales jumped 37 percent to $204 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. International Data expects 2003 revenue to grow 14 percent.

On Tuesday, a spokesman for the department said no reports of abuse or neglect were associated with Alquan White at the time when Rhode Island child welfare authorities, investigating a matter related to Alquan's out-of-state siblings, asked their Connecticut counterpart to determine his whereabouts in 2001. A Connecticut social worker never saw the boy and relied on a report from Mr. James's lawyer that the child was fine. The state medical examiner determined this week that Alquan died from blunt trauma. Mr. James, 38, was charged with capital felony murder in his son's death and is being held in $1.25 million bond.
