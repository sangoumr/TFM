us,DETAILS OF LILCO'S EVACUATION PLAN,"I am writing in response to Bob Stein's Jan. 19 letter to the Long Island editor regarding what he calls ''some of the details of the Lilco Shoreham evacuation plan.'' As a certified radiation health physicist and someone who has been closely involved with the development of Lilco's emergency preparedness plans for the Nassau Coliseum, I would like to set the record straight on the elements of the plan he addresses. 1. He refers to ''directing over 150,000 radiation-exposed people and cars'' to travel to the Nassau Coliseum for monitoring and decontamination. There are three misconceptions in this statement. First, in its emergency planning efforts, Lilco has used a generally accepted population estimate of 160,000 people for the 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone around Shoreham. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that an evacuation of this entire zone would ever be required, it seems obvious that if it ever was required, not every resident would drive a car out of the area. Thus there would be considerably fewer than 150,000 cars going to the Coliseum.",1986-03-02T05:00:00+0000

N. Behrman. Each dealt with the domestic infelicities of the rich and the sybaritic. In partial imitation of Restoration comedy, their plays drew sustenance from an expenditure of style.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ONE IS A WANDERER. By Francis King. (Little, Brown, $16.95.) Francis King's editors are not really his friends. Why, otherwise, would they allow this English novelist and critic to publish a collection of 21 stories so wildly uneven in quality? Mr. King's last novel, ''Voices in an Empty Room,'' showed him master of a subtle, melancholy style, rich and understated. At his best he achieves this in his short stories, but it occurs rarely in this collection. ''Indirect Method'' is a poignant story about an Englishwoman who returns to Japan and visits her family's former houseboy, now a married businessman, who had been her lover. The great chasm between them, and the failure of emotion to bridge it finally, is beautifully rendered, as it is in ''The Festival of the Dead,'' about an Englishwoman whose Japanese lover mourns the death of his young son. ''The Goat,'' an unsettling account of the death of an adored animal, and ''A Corner of a Foreign Field,'' about an old Japanese scholar of English literature, are both small jewels. But the rest of the stories are crude and heavily ironic, lacking depth, perception and finesse. We have the feeling that he is dashing these off. In three of the stories, for example, there appears a woman whose hair is ''an improbable shade of orange.'' Using the same trite phrase three times in the same book is not a criminal offense, but it makes the author's position clear: Mr. King simply can't be bothered to think up a new phrase, one that startles and delights and brings a character into vivid focus.",1986-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Yehoshua's novella ''Facing the Forests'' (published in Israel in 1963), a young Israeli watchman, a forest scout, is haunted by the remains of an Arab village that was bulldozed to make way for a newly planted forest of slender pine trees. The watchman shares the solitude of the forest with an old Arab who cannot speak and an Arab child. The solitude is interrupted every now and then by groups of hikers who come to admire the work of the Afforestation Department. One such group of hikers turned up with a map and inquired as to the whereabouts of an Arab village. ''A village?'' the watchman asked. He knew of no such village: ''The map must be wrong, the surveyor's hand must have shaken.'' But the old Arab, in excited gestures, ''pointing fervently, hopelessly, at the forest,'' confirms that a village once stood there. The young watchman now wants the forest to burn down. Eventually, on the last night of his assignment, he looks away as the old Arab burns down the forest in a ''riot of horror and glee.'' And out of the smoke and haze, the ruined village appears before his eyes ''in its basic outlines as an abstract drawing, as all things past and buried.''",1986-03-02T05:00:00+0000

The other was that he had become the target of exile or refugee groups bent on revenge for difficulties with Swedish authorities. ''They are breaking into every Croat and Kurdish apartment in Europe,'' a former official with good police contacts said. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] Indications of vast Marcos wealth were aboard the he two United States Air Force planes that brought former President Marcos and 88 relatives and associates to Hawaii last week, according to United States Government sources. Documents detailed investments worth potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. [ 1:1. ] The U.S. will use antiterrorist force cautiously. A new policy declaration by the Reagan Administration to be issued Thursday will state that ''a judicious employment of force'' may be required to deter further terrorist attacks, but will rule out random acts of retaliation against states harboring terrorists.

ALEXANDER POPE had a very long period of development as a poet; in fact, one could say it was lifelong. A modern reader new to his work, picking up, say, some close-printed one-volume edition and flicking through the pages, is apt to notice first that with very rare exceptions his poetry is composed in 10-syllable couplets and then to conclude hastily that it is all basically similar, as if one poem in couplets must be like another. In fact, Pope's gamut goes all the way from the prettiness of the early ''Pastorals,'' through the delicate fantasy of ''The Rape of the Lock'' and the surreal and savage burlesque of ''The Dunciad,'' to the calm and luminous irony of the ''Imitations of Horace,'' which discuss life and relationships very directly in a language stripped of ornament and staying very close to prose - though, thanks to the fineness of the poet's ear for rhythm and cadence, never becoming merely prosy. Pope had inherited from Renaissance literary culture the doctrine that literature naturally groups itself in genres, or ''kinds,'' and that there is an appropriate set of conventions and an appropriate linguistic level for each kind, so that training oneself for a fresh attempt on one is like learning a new language. He succeeded in so many kinds that his achievement is complex and not at all easy to assess beyond the simple remark that it is brilliant.",1986-03-02T05:00:00+0000

But more than items from other museums, these can be said to have an added cachet because the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, long considered one of the epicenters of French style, is relatively unfamiliar to Americans. Part of the reason has been its inaccessibility.

DARYL HINE, celebrated for translations of the Homeric Hymns and Theocritus, has embarked on his own autobiography in classical disguise in ''Academic Festival Overtures.'' Though the poem is written in self-proclaimed alexandrines (by alternating 13 and 12 syllables), its indented patterning is suggestive rather of Ovid (part ''Tristia,'' part ''Amores''). The narrative impulse races through long paragraphs, while a rhyme scheme insistently coagulates internal elements into epigrammatic quatrains. It is a virtuoso achievement, as remarkable in its way as anything by Auden. It is also a remarkable record of a yearning, bookish and inhibited boyhood. Behind the metrical screen Mr. Hine imposes on his memoirs, he paces to and fro - as if watching from be-hind the self-imposed bars of his caged existence.",1986-03-02T05:00:00+0000

The dangers in Wilde's case are further compounded by the fact that he self-consciously turned his own life into a fiction.

By the early 1980's Move had evolved into an authoritarian, violence-threatening cult. 2. The residents of 6221 Osage Avenue were armed and dangerous, and used threats, abuse and intimidation to terrify their neighbors and to bring about confrontation. 3. Mayor Goode's policy toward Move was one of appeasement, nonconfrontation and avoidance. 4. The Managing Director and the city's department heads failed to take any effective action on their own and, in fact, ordered their subordinates to refrain from taking action. 5. The city administration discounted negotiation as a method of resolving the problem. Any attempted negotiations were haphazard and uncoordinated. 6. In the first several months of his administration, the Mayor was presented with compelling evidence that his policy of appeasement was doomed to fail. 7. In the summer of 1984, the Mayor was told that the legal basis existed at that time to act against certain Move members. Yet the Mayor held back. 8. From the fall of 1984 to the spring of 1985, the city's policy of appeasement conceded to the residents of 6221 Osage Avenue the continued right to exist above the law. 9. More than any other factor, intensified pressure from the residents of Osage Avenue forced the Mayor to devise a strategy for resolving the problem quickly. 10.",1986-03-07T05:00:00+0000

E. R., Butler, N.J. Answer: Yes. Section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code does not impose limitations on the location of the principal residence, according to Larry Batdorf, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service in Washington, D.C. For a copy of Publication 54, ''Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens Aboard,'' or Publication 523, ''Tax Information on Selling Your Home,'' write: Forms Distribution Center, Box 25866, Richmond, Va. 23260. Rent-Increase Exemptions Question: If an elderly tenant qualifies for the senior citizens' rent-increase exemption, does the landlord get any subsidy? . . . M. T., Staten Island Answer: Yes. The landlord receives a tax-abatement credit equivalent to the rent exemption that can be applied against city real-estate taxes, according to Barrington Wright, assistant commissioner in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

But for most of his stint behind the podium, Tinker, immaculate in a yellow sweater, khakis and a suede jacket, graciously accepted praise for the network's ascent to the top.

In 1893 the widowed sister of Friedrich Nietzsche devoted herself to the care of her deranged and bedridden brother. She gained control of his letters and manuscripts, wrote a three-volume biography of him, established the Nietzsche Archives, manipulated the dissemination of his ideas and, long after Nietzsche's death, befriended Hitler and Mussolini and sought Nazi patronage of her work. In The Book Review in 1977, Martin Green called the story ''a real tragicomedy of the intellectual life'' and found H. F. Peters's account scholarly and workmanlike. A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ, by Walter M. Miller Jr. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) The world, in this fantasy, has been destroyed centuries earlier in a nuclear holocaust and quasi-medieval mankind, armed with the dimly understood remnants of 20th-century science, appears doomed to make the same mistake again. Reviewers in 1960 called Walter M. Miller Jr.'s vision of the future as a repetition of the past ''altogether exceptional'' and ''a remarkable science-fiction novel that soars above the level of mere science fiction into the realm of satire, parable, allegory and philosophy.'' ORIGINAL LETTERS FROM INDIA (1779-1815), by Eliza Fay, edited by E. M. Forster. (Hogarth Press, $6.95.) This collection of letters by Eliza Fay, an Englishwoman who sailed for Calcutta with her lawyer husband in 1779, was originally published in 1817 and reissued in 1925 with notes by E. M. Forster.

This is the most original and provocative question that Liam Hudson, a professor of psychology at Brunel University in Uxbridge, England, asks in ''Night Life,'' a new book on a venerable subject - the interpretation of dreams. In our technological society, ''the dream is at risk,'' he announces with alarm. Comparing ours with ancient times, he has the impression that ''our dreams have become tame.'' He imagines scenarios that might threaten our very capacity to dream. Television, with its rapidly shifting images, its discontinuous narratives and its vicariously thrilling subject matter, may increasingly be doing our dreaming for us. And Mr. Hudson wonders whether the social uses of computers will expand to the point that their way of ''thinking'' will come to rule over our inner lives, forcing everything into rational channels, making all intelligence, in effect, into artificial intelligence. In that event, our imaginative powers might simply atrophy. Dreaming would no longer have an adaptive function in such a society, and if dreams continued to exist at all, they would be little more than a psychic vestige, a sort of mental appendix.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

But to those more familiar with the revisionist methods of current art history, ''Painters and Public Life: In Eighteenth-Century Paris'' will represent the most comprehensive and valuable study of art and public life in that era now in print. Mr. Crow, an assistant professor of art at Princeton University, attempts, with much success, to investigate almost every manifestation of what might be considered public - public life, spaces, opinion, discourse, art and, finally, the public itself, which he sees as ''nothing more nor less than a series of representations.''",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Briefly, for a few years in the 1930's, their paths crossed, and during that time jazz was pop music and vice versa. Those were the Swing years, which started on Aug. 21, 1935, when Benny Goodman's Orchestra found in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles the responsive audience it had trekked across the country looking for. Those years effectively ended after World War II when returning G.I.'s found that, with the emergence of be-bop, jazz was no longer a dance music. Actually, even before the United States entered the war, pop music was going back to its earlier sweet, nonjazz style, with the popularity of Glenn Miller's music and Harry James's discovery that he could draw a wider audience playing such plaintive ballads as ''You Made Me Love You'' than he could with ''Two O'Clock Jump.''",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

The Federal Reserve soon followed, cutting the United States rate by half a point, to 7 percent. And major American banks quickly dropped their prime rates to 9 percent, the lowest in more than seven years. While few would admit it, the seemingly coordinated actions indicated that the Group of 5 major industrialized nations had heeded American wishes. The United States has been seeking to lower interest rates in order to spur the worldwide economy, but was worried that if it moved first, the dollar would be sent into an uncontrolled fall as investors fled into other currencies. And with interest rates already dropping because of the fall in oil prices, the central banks' moves become more a nudge than a shove.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

From a thorough and careful study of documents, mostly concerning patronage, the author vividly characterizes Rembrandt as a repugnant and untrustworthy person.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE POETRY AND POETICS OF AMIRI BARAKA: The Jazz Aesthetic. By William J. Harris. (University of Missouri Press, $20.) For almost 30 years, the poetry of LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka has been a loose cannon on the deck of American verse. Mr. Baraka learned to write as a beatnik, then rejected mentors like Charles Olson and Allen Ginsberg for black nationalism in the 1960's. In tracking the explosive spurts of growth in Mr. Baraka's literary voice, William J. Harris identifies his conscious models as angry jazzmen like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker, both of whom, he writes, attempted to destroy white music so that a new black music could be born. Mr. Baraka used this ''jazz aesthetic'' to invert and transform what the white avant-garde taught him about the poetic process into an actual weapon for black revolt. In his plays, white stereotypes of blacks were transformed from docile figures into strong, often murderous heroes; ''If Bessie Smith had killed some white people she wouldn't have needed that music,'' says a character in Mr. Baraka's 1964 play, ''Dutchman.'' In his 1970 play, ''Jello,'' Jack Benny's faithful chauffeur, Rochester, takes up the razor as a black militant and terrorizes his boss. To jazzify his poetry, Mr. Baraka adapted a ''fast rap'' of scatting, ''songification'' and other oral and performance techniques to grab the ''zoom trembling in its cage.'' He succeeded in synthesizing a powerful Afro-American poetry rooted ''in the tradition, always clarifying, always new and centuries old.'' Mr. Harris, who teaches English at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, also discusses the racism and absolutism that have marred Mr. Baraka's work, factors that might explain his relative exclusion from the American literary scene.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

While there is indeed an important mountain named Mount Nemrut in eastern Turkey and it is at the western end of Lake Van, it is not the same Mount Nemrut as described in the article, which is actually between the Kahta and the Euphrates Rivers. It would indeed be quite a trek from Adiyaman to the Mount Nemrut near Lake Van. (It is merely the case of mistaken identity, having two mountains with the same name in the same general part of the country.) It is not difficult to travel in that part of Turkey. The cities of Gaziantep, Malatya and Diyarbakir all have good hotels with good food, and respectful, though sometimes naive, service. While English is not commonly spoken, French or German can be encountered, and the people are pleasant and helpful with the bewildered tourist. I have traveled extensively in Turkey, only lately gaining a smattering of Turkish, and have fared very well. The hotels in Adiyaman are adequate, though hardly luxe, but not unlike the kind of rustic places you might expect in Vermont or Colorado. (It is best to drink the water delivered as tea to make sure it is safe.) Making arrangements to get to Mount Nemrut is surprisingly easy, particularly from Adiyaman.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

My own education, in the late 50's and early 60's, was similar. When I was a student, there were six Romantic poets: Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge in the first generation, followed by Byron, Shelley and Keats in the second. Then came the Victorians, of whom Tennyson, Browning and Matthew Arnold were the major figures. After that, one would read Hardy perhaps, Hopkins certainly. During long years of undergraduate loneliness, I solaced myself reciting long mouthfuls of Hopkins, savoring those resonant cadences so full of ecstasy and despair. It made no difference that Hopkins was a Jesuit priest and I was a Jewish coed. Thanks to the magic of poetry, he was I, I was he. Finally, there were the supernovas of the moderns: Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Pound, Williams. That was literary history as my professors taught it - and it became my own history. In turn they lit up my sky; I was they, they were I. Needless to say, I read few women poets. The wicked and hilarious Aphra Behn, who should have been snuggling next to the wicked and hilarious Lord Rochester in my 17th-century text, wasn't in the book at all. Poor Dorothy Wordsworth, devoted sister and secretary to William, was absent from among the Romantics, though the prose poetry of her Grasmere journals - which William mined for his poems - is as fresh as new grass.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

The question will not go away; it is constantly resurrected. The networks grow increasingly supranational, roaming the world like sovereign powers. Journalism and self-interest clash; expedience and opportunity play a part. It is unlikely, for example, that ABC News would have put a Communist functionary in Moscow on the air to rebut President Reagan's recent speech on military spending if ABC News had not been all over Moscow in the first place, covering the Communist Party Congress. Even Roone Arledge, the president of ABC News, was there. Television news is egocentric, and ABC News presumably thought that because it was in Moscow, the center of journalistic gravity and urgency had to be there, too. Ergo, ABC allowed Vladimir Posner, a party spokesman, to criticize Mr. Reagan as ''dishonest'' on a domestic American issue.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Charlotte, the physically awkward narrator of ''Flotsam,'' is told by her fashionable roommate: ''You're lucky that you're so nice. . . . Men are going to treat you really well in your next life.'' Needless to say, niceness is a disability. Charlotte, alternately bludgeoned and ignored by romance, is a victim of her own inclination to be overwhelmed by beauty and by folks like those Padgett Powell describes in his novel, ''Edisto,'' as knowing ''the whole alphabet of worldly maneuver.''

us,IN AND OUT OF LOVE AND FAITH,"GENTLEMEN IN ENGLAND A Vision. By A. N. Wilson. 311 pp. New York: Viking. $17.95. MIXED with our nostalgia for the coziness of Victorian life is an impatience with all the things it left unspoken. If, as writers like Peter Gay and Steven Marcus have suggested, Victorians were not quite so repressed as we once thought, they nevertheless maintained the outward signs of repression, which almost amounts to the same thing. When they did exercise their sexuality, they denied it a full acknowledgment, a recognition of its place near the heart of things. To some of us this denial is intolerable, for it is the essence of the modern to say what one feels, to break an ancient silence into which we seem to have been shushed by church, state or society. More and more, we live by pronouncing ourselves. In A. N. Wilson's novel ''Gentlemen in England'' the infinitely articulated manners of his Victorian men and women might be seen as a defense against understanding one another - or even the darker side of themselves. For a novelist, this defense has certain advantages: it gives a character privacy and allows his personality to develop as a pure distillation. As someone said, character is a secret psychosis - but in the 20th century we can't keep secrets.",1986-03-09T05:00:00+0000

The status swizzlers that are making waves in the drinks of the moment are rather less elegant than Cartier's, composed as they are of carnival-colored paper, transparent plastic or flexible tubes that glow in the dark.

Judy Carmichael raised some local eyebrows as well as ears when she made her debut in New York in October 1982, playing stride piano, a music associated with ruggedly muscular male pianists. Miss Carmichael is young, slim and female, but when the great jazz saxophonist Benny Carter heard her playing on a tape, he was puzzled because he thought he was hearing one of the stride pianists of the 1920's, although the recording was obviously much more modern. For more than three years, Miss Carmichael has played frequently at Hanratty's as a soloist, but this weekend she will be part of a trio, something she has been working up to gradually. Last September, she gave a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall with a quartet that included Freddie Green, the guitarist in Count Basie's band; another guitarist, Howard Alden, and the bassist Red Callender. In October, she made an album with Mr. Alden, Mr. Callender and the cornetist Warren Vache, and she played another concert in November at Cooper Union with Mr. Vache and Mr. Alden. More recently she found that Michael Hashim, the alto saxophonist with the Widespread Jazz Orchestra, lived around the corner from her on the West Side and they played a weekend at Struggles in Edgewater, N.J., with Mr. Alden on guitar.

I left my friends on the road above and backtracked only to keep those following us from trying this tempting shortcut. I chalked a warning on the road, peered again down the shadowy descent, succumbed to temptation and plunged. I tell myself I am a fool; I should climb back.

IT is easy to be interesting about travel in the third world. One can arrive in a country like Zaire and, simply by walking into a hotel bar or taking an internal airline flight and recording what one hears and sees, come up with something revealing about the place. Alex Shoumatoff, a writer for The New Yorker, does this in ''In Southern Light.'' He flies from Kinshasa to Isiro in Zaire. At the Isiro airport, he waits with his fellow passengers while baggage handlers dump their luggage onto the runway and then devote themselves to the more important task of loading valuable tusks, some of them from elephants killed by poachers, that are owned by a local government official. (Mr. Shoumatoff learns the provenance of the tusks from a Belgian coffee planter he meets on the plane.) Two hours elapse before ''an official announced that nothing was going to be done about the baggage, and we were al-lowed to walk past the soldier in spotted fatigues who had been guarding it with an automatic rifle and retrieve it ourselves.'' Clearly, we are not at O'Hare. This is a glimpse into another world.",1986-03-16T05:00:00+0000

How much damage the order will do to U.S.-Soviet relations was not imediately clear. Moscow said it would not help the atmosphere of the summit that is to be held in Washington this year or early next year; but the Russians did not threaten to cancel the meeting.

us,THE AIR IS LEAKING OUT OF CLEVELAND'S CUSHION,"MORE than 3,500 mayors and other municipal officials, members of the National League of Cities, met in Washington last week to seek ways of containing the damage done by Federal aid cuts required under the new budget-balancing law. One of the mayors' principal efforts - many of them said privately it is almost sure to fail - is to save general revenue sharing, which has provided $4.2 billion a year for local governments to use as they wish. Among the most successful beneficiaries of that program is George V. Voinovich , the Republican Mayor of Cleveland and a former president of the national league, whose city is said to have acquired more Federal funds per capita than any other major municipality since President Reagan entered the White House. In Cleveland recently, John Herbers, national correspondent of The New York Times, talked about the state of the cities with Mayor Voinovich, who has become increasingly outspoken in his opposition to the urban policies of his national party. Excerpts from their discussion follow. Question. What will Cleveland's situation be next year if cuts in Federal aid under the new balanced-budget law go into effect?",1986-03-16T05:00:00+0000

He thought he had found it to the far south, entering what he called the Freshwater Sea, now known as the Rio de la Plata, on the Atlantic coast of southern South America. (Four centuries later Jorge Luis Borges would dub it the river of ''dreamery'' and mud.) To its discoverers it appeared only as a vast body of water with swampy shores. On its west bank a handful of men were left to establish a settlement. Poetry was already lurking: on board with Solis was Martin del Barco Centenera, who wrote an ode titled ''The Argentina,'' thus giving a name to the new lands. A misnomer, since there was practically no argentum, no silver, there. The ode bestowed on the newly named Argentina Tritons, sirens and other European mythical creatures.

THE prolific Australian writer Thomas Keneally obviously likes to give himself tough assignments. Undeterred by the accidents of nationality or the hard facts of embryology, he has, in his recent fiction, chosen the American Civil War as the subject of one novel (''Confederates'') and a preternaturally sophisticated fetus as the narrator of another (''Passenger''). Still more ambitiously, he has written a gripping ''nonfiction novel'' of the Holocaust, ''Schindler's List,'' in which he tells the true story - embellished with an abundance of historical and imagined detail - of a Sudeten German industrialist and bon vivant, Oskar Schindler, who ingeniously and recklessly managed to snatch several thousand Jews from the very gullet of the Nazi death machine. ''Schindler's List'' won the Booker Prize in England, where it was published as a novel, and brought Mr. Keneally a wide audience in this country, where it was published as nonfiction. His new work, which seems to be in part a spinoff from the research undertaken for its predecessor, is again bold in its scope and its choice of subject.",1986-03-16T05:00:00+0000

THE second volume of Peter Gay's projected five-volume survey of middle-class culture in the 19th century is a less tidy affair than its predecessor. In ''The Education of the Senses,'' (1984), the first volume of ''The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud,'' Mr. Gay took issue with received wisdom about Victorian sexuality. Despite their exaggerated fears of masturbation and their insistence on confining sex to marriage, the Victorians, he argued, appreciated sexual pleasure and pursued it avidly. His exploration of 19th-century love (the ''tender passion'' of the title of this volume) yields no such sharply etched revisionist thesis. To be sure, his book contains an argument of sorts, and many telling insights, but it is often overwhelmed by biographical detail, textual commentary and psychoanalytic speculation whose significance for his general portrait is not entirely clear.",1986-03-16T05:00:00+0000

The texture resembles nonchocolate brownies. Sometimes mud hens are referred to as butterscotch brownies. Q. Are you familiar with an English dish called pickled oysters? A. Pickled oysters were reportedly quite fashionable once in England. They are rarely prepared today. A recipe appears in that venerable volume, ''Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management.'' In her version, 100 oysters are gently cooked in their own liquor. They are then put into jars. The liquor is reserved and added to an equal volume of vinegar along with a blade of mace, a piece of lemon peel and 12 black peppercorns. This mixture cooks five minutes, cools, and is poured over the oysters. The jars are then sealed tightly and stored. Q. I have read of a salad made with something called hartshorn. What is it? A. Hartshorn, a European delicacy, is an edible weed with green leaves vaguely resembling the antlers of a deer. It grows in sandy soil near salt water and must be plucked and eaten while young.

''The fact of the matter is, Keith and I aren't getting on too well,'' Mr. Jagger said in a recent telephone conversation. With the first Rolling Stones album for Columbia due in the stores on Monday, Mr. Richards has been telling the press he wants the band to tour this year, and thinks, or hopes, that it will. ''I'd love to be out there playing, and of course the money would be great,'' Mr. Jagger admitted. ''But there's no point unless it's going to be fun, and right now things are just too difficult. We are not going to tour this year.'' Tension between the two musicians, who referred to themselves for a time as ''the Glimmer Twins,'' is nothing new, nor is it surprising. But this is the first time any of the Rolling Stones have chosen to air their differences in such plain language and in public. Business-wise, a tour would seem to be the sensible thing to do. The forthcoming ''Dirty Work'' is the Stones' first album for Columbia since the band signed a multimillion-dollar contract with the company last year. The first fruits of that contract, last year's Mick Jagger solo album ''She's the Boss,'' was a success but hardly a blockbuster.

Since no one, to my knowledge, had ever eaten such a thing, it was unclear why anyone should be obliged to cook it -especially while the boys were off in shop learning useful things like carpentry and radio repair.

IN SHORT","THE LOSS OF SELF: A Family Resource for the Care of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. By Donna Cohen and Carl Eisdorfer. (Norton, $18.95.) Alzheimer's disease, believed to afflict over two million middle-aged and older Americans, has been called the silent epidemic. But in recent years this condition has been widely publicized, and the availability of information and other resources for patients' families has greatly increased. Among the latest contributions is this book by Donna Cohen, a professor of geriatrics in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Carl Eisdorfer, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Miami School of Medicine, who for over 15 years have studied the disorder and worked with patients and their families. Intended mainly to assist families caring for members who have Alzheimer's disease, the book deals with psychological, logistical, biomedical, legal and financial issues. It does not shy from such sensitive topics as the sexuality of patients and their partners, the possibility of suicide among disease victims and the risk of serious depression in care givers. Material on the interaction of family members with patients and among themselves is a particular strength of the book. Almost without exception, the authors provide concrete advice without being dogmatic. Thus they present many guidelines (often in the convenient form of lists) and useful facts, even as they emphasize again and again, both explicitly and through many anecdotes about patients and their families, that every situation is different and no single right formula exists.",1986-03-23T05:00:00+0000

THE NEW HYSTERIA","HUNGER STRIKE The Anorectic's Struggle as a Metaphor for Our Age. By Susie Orbach. 201 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $15.95. IN ''Fat Is a Feminist Issue'' (1978) Susie Orbach, a psychotherapist and co-founder of the Women's Therapy Center Institute in New York City, offered one of the first feminist analyses of women's obsessions with food and body size. In ''Hunger Strike: The Anorectic's Struggle as a Metaphor for Our Age,'' a cultural and clinical study of anorexia nervosa, Miss Orbach reads anorexia as ''a dramatic expression of the internal compromise wrought by Western women in the 1980s in their attempt to negotiate their passions and desires in a time of extraordinary confusion.''

A more eccentrically sung and acted Carmen has probably never been heard and seen in this opera house than the one delivered by Miss Ewing on this opening night. The melodic line was persistently torn to shreds by her nasty lunges into notes, her disregard for phrasing in pursuit of who knew what theatrical effects and her disconcerting register separations, which sometimes made it sound as if three or four different voices were attacking the part of Carmen simultaneously. It was clear rather early that someone at the Metropolitan had made a serious miscalculation in planning this production.

MANY of our best novelists are obsessed with exploring the nature of the family, and for good reason. What is more fascinating than these disparate beings who inhabit the same households, breathe the same air, inspire hope and expectation and - all too often - cause disappointment? The disintegration of a family, particularly one in which a young child has died, moves us directly into a territory of sorrow.

Part fact and part fiction, ''Hoopla'' re-creates the year 1919 and baseball's infamous ''Black Sox'' scandal, when eight members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of conspiring to throw the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds and were banned from major-league ball. In The Book Review in 1984, Ira Berkow said that Harry Stein's work, ''kaleidoscopic, vivid, tragic - earns a place among the splendid novels about sports.'' LINDEN HILLS, by Gloria Naylor. (Penguin, $6.95.) An adaptation of Dante's ''Inferno,'' this novel by Gloria Naylor has as its locale the affluent suburb of Linden Hills, a thriving community of black professionals. But beneath the facade of material success is revealed a grim world of lost black souls trapped in the American dream. Mel Watkins said in The Book Review in 1985 that while Miss Naylor was not entirely successful in adapting the ''Inferno'' to the world of the black middle class, she displays ''wit and insight into the tensions and anxieties that plague assimilated blacks.''

Relying upon exaggeration and the macabre, the genre slips easily into self-parody (the plot of the first Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's 1764 ''Castle of Otranto,'' all but defies rational summation) and has long inspired such deliberate spoofs as Austen's ''Northanger Abbey'' and Peacock's ''Nightmare Abbey.''

IN SHORT","THE PURSUIT OF HEALTH. By June Bingham and Norman Tamarkin. (Walker, $16.95.) The idea that the mind can influence the body's response to disease (and vice versa) has had a long and at times controversial history. In ''The Pursuit of Health,'' June Bingham, a writer, and Norman Tamarkin, a psychiatrist, travel two steps farther in the quest to determine ''why one person gets sick and another doesn't or why someone gets sick today and not tomorrow.'' To ''mind'' and ''body'' they add ''other people'' and ''the environment'' as factors that directly influence our state of well-being. They have constructed a model that integrates these four dimensions around a core, the ''intimate connector,'' that is the central force responsible for a patient's will to live or will to health. The authors cite examples of people who, against all odds and for reasons that defy clinical explanation, have survived an illness far beyond the expectations of their doctors. The book also includes six case histories that exemplify ways in which attention to dimensions other than the one causing the illness was the turning point in the patient's recovery. For example, a young woman who was suicidal (mind) is given a prescription for exercise and an enriched diet to improve her health (body) so she can begin to work on the weakened relationships (other people) that caused her illness in the first place. The message for physicians is that when examining patients, they should look well beyond the symptoms that brought the patient to them in the first place.",1986-03-23T05:00:00+0000

Given the highly volatile state of fashion then, this prediction did not seem in the least farfetched. It was. The principles of summer dressing, in fact, never really changed. If anything, there is a marked resurgence of traditional elements of style.

RICHARD RESTAK, neurologist: ''The Brain.'' I don't discuss my writing with medical colleagues any more than I discuss my patients with journalists and editors. With patients, the situation is more complicated. They often can tell if their doctor is interested in them for themselves or only as background for a book. I constantly remind myself, therefore, that my patients are like patients in every age and every place: they seek a cure or some palliation for their suffering or, at the very least, someone who will accept them, listen to them and thereby help them in ways that cannot always be explained. PENELOPE LEACH, psychologist: ''Your Baby and Child.'' One day I was a research psychologist discussing Apgar scores (a measure of newborns' physical condition) with medical colleagues. Next day I was a mother, asking my baby's Apgar and being told, ''Leave that to us.'' Still resenting the authoritarianism, the chauvinism of some doctors dealing with people they insist on addressing as ''Mother,'' I have learned how deep a communication gulf there can be, even when doctors acknowledge parents' rights and try to explain. Sick children mean anxious parents who may be unable to hear the doctor's messages. Parents say that honest medical information, absorbed calmly from books and magazines, radio and television, paves the way for understanding.",1986-03-23T05:00:00+0000

A decade later, just before his 40th birthday, he began to use his personal term, ''psychoanalysis,'' to describe his mode of therapy. Psychoanalysis still survives among us, as an isolated and disputable therapy, a particular variety of psychiatry. As such, though international in scope, it can be said to have become a small subbranch, almost a sect, within American psychiatric medicine. Freud hated the notion that his legatees would be part of the American medical profession, since he cordially disliked both the United States and most doctors of medicine. His preference in disciples would have continued to be European intellectuals, lay analysts with broad cultural interests who could have applied the Freudian theory of the mind to every sort of cultural or social question.

MIND is such an odd predicament for matter to get into.

If a brain is just three pounds of blood, dreams and electricity, how does it manage to contemplate itself, worry about its soul, do time and motion studies, admire the shy hoofs of a goat, know that it will die, enjoy all the grand and lesser mayhem of love? What is mind, that one can be ''out of one's . . .''? How can a neuron feel compassion? What is a self if, as Judith Hooper and Dick Teresi observe, ''what our Victorian grandparents used to call 'character' is contained in an intricate matrix of speech centers, motor pathways, and minute electrical circuits''? Why did automatic, hand-me-down mammals like our ancestors somehow evolve brains with the ability to consider, imagine, project, compare, abstract, think of the future?

The stones themselves are thick with history, and those cats that dash through the alleyways must surely be the ghosts of the famous dead in feline disguise. Many noted artists, after all, died here: Wagner, Browning, Diaghilev - though some, like Dante, merely died of maladies contracted on their last visit. These illustrious deaths have given the city a certain spooky patina and a faintly macabre reputation - like New Orleans, only more so. Or maybe it is the time-stopped nature of the place, the fact that so many vistas still look exactly as they do in Carpaccio or Bellini paintings (except for the television antennas, of course) which gives you the sense that you can turn a corner and walk into the past - as the accompanying photographs by Michael O'Neill illustrate.",1986-03-23T05:00:00+0000

President Reagan and House Democrats, representing broad constituencies, resent and distrust each other's basic instincts in dealing with Nicaragua. But however our checks and balances are finally calibrated, the Sandinistas should have no doubt about Americans' disapproval of their present course. What produced the 222-210 vote against giving Mr. Reagan free rein was agreement to vote again next month on a better hedged package of sanctions.

For a very long time, it has been clear that the Cartesian separation of mind and body was a philosophical fiction. (In non-Western cultures, Descartes would have been laughed out of the room.) As a practical matter, dualism has been refuted by the successful use of biofeedback, faith healing, placebos, and hypnosis, among other things. But only recently has medical science begun to take official notice that attitude and temperament are intertwined with neurobiological phenomena. Thus the straight-faced reference to a new medicine of mind and body.",1986-03-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Assuming that ''Star Wars'' becomes a reality and can knock out Soviet intercontinental missiles, what happens to their nuclear warheads? A. Michael Ross, a spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the country's nuclear weapons design laboratories, said military experts there believe a warhead on a missile would be destroyed if struck by a laser of sufficient intensity or some other weapon in the missile shield program. He said a continuous laser would burn a hole through the warhead, in much the same way that lasers in industry cut metal, and would possibly ignite the high explosives. There would be no nuclear explosion, he said, because the warhead's explosives must be set off in a special way to create one. If the laser is a pulse laser, such as an X-ray or free-electron laser, the warhead's outer surface would be heated very quickly, producing internal shock waves that would tear the warhead apart, Mr. Ross said. If the warhead is hit at an altitude below about 250 miles, most fragments would eventually fall to earth and vaporize on re-entry. Only the largest fragments would survive re-entry to hit the surface, he said. If the warhead is hit above 250 miles many fragments might float into space. The large chunks of the warhead might contain hazardous material such as uranium or plutonium but could readily be detected and collected. ''The hazard of the vaporized material would be much much less than if the warhead had actually detonated over its target,'' Mr. Ross said.",1986-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Now he's getting a chance to find out what it's like to coach without one hand tied behind his back. The 41-year-old Evans was named head coach at Pitt, the Big East school that limped to a 15-14 record this season despite a wealth of talented recruits. Evans, who compiled a 119-60 record in six years at Navy, including an 80-19 record the last three seasons, succeeds Roy Chipman, who resigned the Pitt post and left coaching. Evans, calling Navy's success this year a fluke, said it was unrealistic to expect a military academy team to be among the top teams in the nation every year. Describing the Pitt job as ''just what I was looking for,'' Evans said his first task would be to impose a bit of Navy-style discipline on the Panthers. ''They need the discipline and they realize that,'' he said after a meeting with the Pitt team. ''They tailed off at the end of the season despite some good players. I don't know if the talent is as good as the press makes it out to be, but we'll find out.'' Pitt sources estimated that Evans's four-year contract would bring him about $800,000, including broadast fees, or about four times his salary at Navy. . . .

My guess is that dust in the basement air, or possibly fine soot fumes from the heating system, coated the pine paneling with a light film of soil or grime, all but where the pictures were hanging.

Though personal income taxes are already scheduled to decline, the Senate's Republican majority leader, Warren Anderson, seeks additional tax relief credit with a plan to exempt clothes costing less than $75 from the state's 4 percent sales tax. The benefit, $40 saved on $1,000 of qualifying clothing per year, seems slight and would appear to benefit the middle class more than the poor. So dubious an item shouldn't be allowed to complicate the budget negotiation. Subsidized drugs. Medicare doesn't pay for prescription drugs. The Democratic Assembly would pay for those purchased by the elderly poor. In other states, the lack of any contribution by the recipient has led to abuses as the elderly acquire free drugs for relatives, or even for sale. A Senate version of the plan would pay for drugs costing more than 5 percent of the elderly patient's income and 4 percent for the elderly poor. That is clearly the better concept. Transit bridge. In the Assembly, Speaker Stanley Fink sees the probability of a transit fare increase later this year. He proposes allocating now the $28 million necessary to keep fares from rising in December. Senator Anderson agrees money will be needed, and much more in fiscal 1988, but, preferring to hold New York City's huge share hostage to programs he may push later in the year, he objects to allocating the appropriation now.",1986-03-27T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"If you recall Bette Davis as the pathological governess in ''The Nanny,'' you'll be chilled. Read the British author Patricia Angadi's first novel, THE GOVERNESS (Gollancz/David & Charles, $18.95) and initially you'll be left cold. The novel opens in 1918 in London; the first narrator in this book of many narrators is Eleanor Lane-Baker, a stereotypical weary wife and exasperated mother of six. Eleanor raises questions that by 1918 standards were bold: ''Why should not men, at some time in their lives, be made to suffer as women do? Why should they not have the agony of both menstruation and giving birth?'' The futility of these questions aside, Eleanor does the only thing she believes a woman can do - she hires another woman, Violet Mabel Herring, known as Herry, to be governess in her household. Once Herry becomes part of this family's fabric she is referred to as a saint by Edward, Eleanor's husband, and five of their children, and perceived as an evil force by the not-quite-reliable son, Justus. All the reader knows for certain is that Herry seems quite capable, smiles a lot and is quite tolerant of Eleanor's and Justus's sarcasm. Patricia Angardi supplies the reader with each family member's point of view on Herry between 1918 and 1938; what these alternating narratives make clear is that the book has less to do with Herry's sainthood or evil than with the ubiquitous neuroses of the family. So while the author's intention may have been to create a black tale about the insidious nature of blind benevolence, the family's dissolution - which includes Edward's seduction of Herry, Miles's suicide and Helen's nervous breakdown - seems inevitable regardless of Herry's role as a ''red herring,'' blamed for the problems of the Lane-Bakers.",1986-03-30T05:00:00+0000

This book, the seventh, continues the exploration. First published in Belgium under the title ''Ernest et Celestine au Musee,'' the new book brings Ernest and Celestine to a museum - the Louvre in Paris, no less. Ernest applies for a job there, but will only accept the position if Celestine can accompany him daily to work. He doesn't get the job. Nevertheless, they spend the day enjoying the splendid art in the museum. So engrossed is Ernest in the art that he momentarily loses track of Celestine. Happily, they are reunited. Yet Celestine is worried that Ernest is more fond of the paintings than of her. The concern is temporary, for Ernest sets her mind at ease by saying: ''There is nothing I like better than you, Celestine!''",1986-03-30T05:00:00+0000

Not only were both primarily concerned with the contrapuntal integrity of musical lines, but their methods began to converge as well.

THE most influential writers of history in the Western world are the Greek and Roman historians, yet in the way we tend to think of history today, they were rarely, and then often inadvertently, historians. To write about ancient society in a form that modern historians would regard as history, scholars must try to construct an account from reluctant and elusive source materials: the fragments of stone and papyrus that have survived the ravages of earthquake, weather and vandalism; whatever literary evidence ancient writers chose to give us; and whatever facts can be gleaned from the scattered and partial evidence of archeology. If we now have some notion of the economic life and the underlying political motives of Greek and Roman society, it is largely because of Sir Moses Finley, the emeritus professor of ancient history at the University of Cambridge, who in his own books and through the works of his pupils has given economic and political factors the attention the ancients neglected to pay them.",1986-03-30T05:00:00+0000

I understand that the lot, which measures 25 by 100 feet, is too small to build on and that I can buy it from the city. I would like to put up a fence and plant a garden, and have made several calls to the city but have not been able to get information. Can you help me?. . .J. G., Staten Island Answer: The Adjacent Homeowners Program of the Department of General Services allows private owners of adjacent properties to buy city-owned lots. According to Barbara Perkins, a spokesman for General Services, such lots must be under 2,600 square feet, have an appraised value of less than $3,000, be in an area zoned for residential use and be surrounded by privately owned properties. Only homeowners whose property abuts such a lot for at least 10 contiguous feet are eligible, and the lots are restricted to such ''accessory'' uses as a garden, a side yard or a parking area. A house cannot be built on the lot, and it cannot be sold separately from the owner's home for five years after the sale. Eligible lots are auctioned off through a sealed bidding process, with minimum bids of $500. Interested homeowners can call the program office at 566-3841.

Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande,'' like Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' communicates the nature of tragedy through its orchestra. For tragedy posits a degree of helplessness - a controlling and consuming force surrounding its protagonists.

I believe that men have struck a perfect balance between personal and professional lives. Reasonable accommodation of private lives? Nonsense. Humanization of the work world? Who needs it? I've made it clear to my friends and family that love, affection, friendship and human emotion play a small role in the life of a real professional.'' And what if the interviewer asks about children? ''Not to worry. Test tube babies for me. That way I can wait until I'm 40, 50, even 60 before I start a family, until my career is really well established. I'm no fool.''",1986-03-30T05:00:00+0000

Others might think of the semijournalistic works of Roland Barthes.

Raffles, was a great favorite on both sides of the Atlantic at the turn of the century. Hornung's popularity, in fact, rivaled that of his brother-in-law, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Raffles's daring exploits were dramatized for the stage with great success and later brought to the screen in film versions starring Ronald Colman and David Niven. ''One reads what Mr. Hornung has written with a kind of fascination such as the serpent is credited with exercising,'' our reviewer wrote in 1899, asserting, ''There is not a prosaic line in one of the eight stories in the book.'' This edition includes an essay written in 1944 by George Orwell. THE FALCONER OF CENTRAL PARK, by Donald Knowler. (Bantam, $8.95.) The English journalist and amateur ornithologist Donald Knowler chronicles 12 months in the life of Central Park, following the fortunes of the human and animal species that populated its 834 acres during 1982. August Heckscher said in The Book Review in 1984 that the park, ''itself an almost miraculous survivor in the clogged and asphalt city . . . has been caught, like one of its own birds in flight . . . upon the pages of this lovely book.'' THE WAR BETWEEN THE TATES, by Alison Lurie. (Avon, $3.95.)

One can safely speculate that commercial theatrical managements offer Mr. Kline nearly every starring role for which he might be remotely suited. Yet, since making his Broadway debut in a supporting part in the musical ''On the Twentieth Century,'' the actor has limited his Broadway appearances to classics (''The Pirates of Penzance,'' ''Arms and the Man'') and a superior contemporary play (Michael Weller's ''Loose Ends'') - all under the aegis of nonprofit theatrical institutions. Mr. Kline's choice of Hollywood film projects (''The Big Chill,'' ''Sophie's Choice,'' ''Silverado'') has been similarly schlock-free.
