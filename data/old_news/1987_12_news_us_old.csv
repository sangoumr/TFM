The only noticeable departure from convention was a small outburst of didactic works that reached its nadir in a line of books called ''Disney's Classic Value Stories,'' with the title ''Walt Disney's Dumbo and the Magic Feather: A Tale About Confidence.'' Confidence? I thought ''Dumbo'' was a tale about a baby elephant with big ears who learns to fly by getting drunk. No such thing. In this bowdlerized version of the Disney classic, Dumbo falls asleep sober and has a dream of ''flapping his ears and flying.'' The next morning he wakes up high in a tree. Gone is ''Pink Elephants on Parade.'' I suppose this will help to lower the rate of alcoholism among 6-year-olds.

The light of Christmas in New York is different from the light of any other time, or of any other place; it is more precise, more delicate, at once overpowering in its sweep and gentle in the way it touches the eye. The tree at Rockefeller Center is by tradition the touchstone of the New York Christmas, and it deserves to remain so forever, although if the truth be told, I prefer the march of trees along Park Avenue, with their tiny lights of white, to the multicolored array at Rockefeller Center, for the tree at Rockefeller Center is really a bigger version of the kind that exists everywhere else, while the trees of Park Avenue could be nowhere but in New York.",1987-12-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Art: Legendary Influence Of Black Mountain College,"IN the history of the postwar avant-garde, the name Black Mountain College crops up repeatedly, framed in the golden glow of legend. The list of artists and writers who as students and teachers entered into the school's short, experimental existence is studded with impressive names. Founded in 1933 in the hills outside Asheville, N.C., by a group of disenchanted faculty members from Rollins College in Florida, Black Mountain placed the arts and, in its first years, especially the visual arts, at the center of its curriculum. One of its leading lights was Josef Albers, who arrived at Black Mountain late in 1933. Albers was fresh from the Bauhaus, just closed for good by the new Nazi Government, and he brought with him ideas and teaching methods that would eventually modernize American art education. Other teachers included the poet Charles Olson, who ran the school in its final years (it closed in 1957); Ben Shahn; Stefan Wolpe; Ilya Bolotowsky; Robert Motherwell; Merce Cunningham; John Cage, and Albers's wife, Anni, a textile designer who set up a weaving workshop based on the Bauhaus model. Clement Greenberg, Franz Kline, Alfred Kazin and Harry Callahan were among those who taught at the school's lively summer sessions. In October 1952, Shoji Hamada, the great Japanese ceramist, and Bernard Leach, his friend and British counterpart, taught a monthlong workshop.",1987-12-04T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. ARCADIA, 21 East 62d Street (223-2900) - **(Jan. 18. 1985) This cozy East Side restaurant has a little bar up front and a dining room ringed with mauve banquettes. The menu melds the best of American regional cuisine without becoming cute. Appetizer choices include grilled leeks in puff pastry with onion marmalade and chive butter as well as corn cakes with caviars and creme fraiche. During the game season, you might order medallions of venison with cranberry-black pepper sauce and yellow turnip tower; grilled duck steak with wild mushroom and port sauce and wild rice pancakes and kale; or sauteed quail on wild-bean and swiss chard ragout. It makes sense to save room for dessert - the chocolate bread pudding with brandy custard sauce and flourless chocolate terrine, for example. Dinner prix fixe $55. Fridays, noon and 1:45 P.M. seatings and 6 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 10 P.M.: closed Sundays. BRIVE, 405 East 58th Street (838-9393) - **(Sept. 5, 1986) A romantic town house with a relatively quiet and comfortable atmosphere provides the backdrop for some arresting food. You might begin with noisette of rabbit with artichoke polenta or a torte of duck and ginger. For a main dish, a number of game dishes are available: roast saddle of venison with a chestnut tart; stuffed pigeon, and grilled Muscovy duck breast with three cranberry purees. Prix fixe $50. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 10 P.M.; closed Sundays. THE FOUR SEASONS, 99 East 52d Street (754-9494) - ***(Nov. 22, 1985) The lavish Pool Room with its graciously appointed tables, lofty foliage and illuminated marble pools is for romance and extravagance. To start you might order the pheasant consomme, fettuccine with wild truffles or a game-bird pate. During the game season main dish options include fillet of venison sauteed with apples and red cabbage; grilled quails with mustard and sage, and breast of pheasant baked with mustard and filberts. Entrees $34 to $42.50. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11:30 P.M.; closed Sundays. GOTHAM BAR AND GRILL, 12 East 12th Street (620-4020) - ***(Oct. 4, 1985) The multi-tier dining room with its tall columns and high ceilings provides a spacious and comfortable backdrop for some alluring and visually dazzling contemporary cooking. Starter options are squab salad with couscous, croutons and curried vinaigrette; duck confit with lettuces, smoked bacon and lemon-mustard vinaigrette, and guinea hen and foie gras terrine with lettuces, lentils and croutons. For the winter menu, entree choices include Moulard duck breast with figs, turnips and green peppercorns; roast squab over wild mushrooms with Swiss chard, spatzle and mustard butter, and Red deer with sauteed green apple and lingonberries. Dinner entrees $22 to $26. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 5 to 10 P.M. NANNI IL VALLETTO, 133 East 61st Street (838-3939) - **(May 16, 1986) One of the more splendiferous Italian restaurants in town is this plush establishment with oversize mirrors and comfortable banquettes. The kitchen is capable of turning out some spectacular pastas - bow-ties tossed with a melange of diced tomatoes, basil, zucchini and eggplant or thin spaghetti with minced shrimp, clams and fresh herbs. And during the season, the menu offers roast quail, venison, pheasant and wild boar prepared with celery, onion, carrots and Barrolo wine. Dinner entrees $27.50 to $30. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to midnight; closed Sundays. RESTAURANT RAPHAEL, 33 West 54th Street (582-8993) - **(Nov. 28, 1986) The atmosphere is refined and rustically elegant at this midtown restaurant; pale yellow walls alternate with pastoral murals in the long rectangular dining room. The chef has a controlled and classically oriented French style, leavened with a sharp eye for presentation. Starters include seafood ravioli with a light tarragon sauce; marinated salmon with ginger, and salad of duck confit. The winter menu features grilled marinated venison with apples, cranberry and apricot as well as breast of pheasant, which can be roasted with wild mushrooms or stuffed with sauteed pears and port wine. Dinner entrees $19.50 to $28. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 10:30 P.M.; closed Sundays. What the stars mean, page C2O.",1987-12-04T05:00:00+0000

It was also her second straight victory in the Iroquois, which she won last year in the same time of 1:44 4/5. Anniron earned $42,120 for her owner, William A. Martusewicz, and returned $4.60 for $2 to win. Goodbye Halo Runs First: Running for the first time in the West, Goodbye Halo captured the $549,100 Hollywood Starlet for 2-year-old fillies by 3 1/2 lengths yesterday in Inglewood, Calif. Ridden by Jorge Velasquez, Goodbye Halo took over the lead heading into the stretch and finished the mile race 3 1/2 lengths ahead in 1:36 1/5. Goodbye Halo, winner of two races in New York including the Demoiselle by 10 lengths Nov. 7, went off at 11-1 and returned $24.80 for $2 to win.(AP) Speed Skating Russian Sets Record: Igor Zhelezovsky of the Soviet Union, racing in the last of 19 pairings, set a world record of 1:52.50 yesterday to win the men's 1,500-meter race at the World Cup speed skating competition on the ultra-fast Olympic Speed Skating Oval track in Calgary, Alberta. Ki-Tae Bae of South Korea took the gold in the second of two men's 500-meter sprints with a time of 37:08. The East German team dominated the two women's races, sweeping the medals in the 3,000 meters and conceding only a silver to Bonnie Blair of the United States in the 1,000-meter race.(AP) N.B.A. Cavaliers 97, Lakers 95: Tyrone Corbin tipped in a missed shot at the buzzer last night, giving Cleveland the victory in Richfield, Ohio. Brad Daugherty of Cleveland missed a 15-foot jump shot before Corbin leaped out of a pack of players to tap in the game-winner. Cleveland led, 95-89, when Phil Hubbard made two foul shots with 2:07 remaining. Los Angeles scored the next 6 points to tie the game on a hook shot by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a driving layup by Magic Johnson, and Byron Scott's jumper with 55 seconds left. Dell Curry and Johnson missed jump shots before Cleveland called timeout with 15 seconds left to set up the game-winning sequence.(AP) Mavericks 109, Nuggets 96: Mark Aguirre scored 17 of his 35 points during a 20-0 second-quarter outburst and Dallas went on to defeat Denver. Dallas held off a fourth-quarter Denver charge in which the visitors slashed a 25-point deficit to 94-87 with 5:30 to play. But Aguirre's steal and dunk with 56 seconds to play clinched the victory for the Mavericks, who won for the seventh time in their last nine games.(AP)",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

The would-be bohemians of ''The Whole Sick Crew'' who inhabit Pynchon's first novel, ''V,'' (1963) are quite reminiscent of the pretentious forgers and partygoers of ''The Recognitions.''

The reason, he suggests, is that men often assume, somewhat ingenuously, that ''if a person of note is wearing a thing, it must be correct.'' Or rakish, or hip, or daring, as the case may be. The adjective is a function of the role one chooses, and as l988 approaches, appropriate models for that role may be as worldly/suave as Michael Douglas, playing a powerful corporate raider in the upcoming film ''Wall Street,'' or as reassuringly square as Det.

(In the first few years of the list the books were called ''outstanding,'' not ''best,'' but the editors then meant the same thing we mean.) For the first time in some years, poetry is on the list: a selection from the works of the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. The six books on the fiction list are all novels - in marked contrast to last year, when there were four collections of short stories. Two of the most traditional in form, those by Saul Bellow and Tom Wolfe, are also the most hilarious. Julian Barnes uses a traditional form, and narrative technique, to create a vision of almost poetic grandeur. Toni Morrison and T. Coraghessan Boyle use history and even ghosts to show us transforming visions of American life. The least traditional in form is Philip Roth's latest novel; it deconstructs itself (intentionally) several times over.",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Here, the planners and the voters, not the real-estate developers, hold the power. The process of getting approval to put up a high-rise office building in the downtown business district here is so complex it must make the hardiest developer yearn for the simplicities of doing business in New York. In San Francisco, the amount of new office construction permitted each year is limited by a strict quota; there are also limits on the height of those tall buildings that do get approved, and restrictions on their locations. A panel of architectural experts must give its approval to each project, which among other requirements must be designed so as to not put any existing park or plaza in shadow. And there is more: a developer wishing to erect an office tower must make a contribution to the city's transit and housing funds, provide or help finance day-care facilities and then be able to certify the economic viability of his project by showing in advance that tenants are interested in taking space.",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

And further years to understand that I didn't mean adventurer either, but some compound poet-naturalist-explorer whose snares were sentences and whose darts were tipped with the curare of wonder. There was a fine literary tradition to join, though I didn't suspect it at the time, which included such rich fictioneers as Melville and Conrad, who had tramped through what Wallace Stevens would later call ''the wild country of the soul,'' and also rhapsodic nonfiction writers like Loren Eiseley, who always found a green thought for a green shade. Or there were literate explorers like Sir Richard Burton, or sensuous tourists like Walter Pater. But the more film and television electrified armchair travelers with quick sensory jolts, the more travel writing seemed to be looked upon as mild and faintly amateurish.

In our day, such efforts at exhumation have become such an integral part of musical life that it is hard to imagine a time when digging into the past was not only difficult but unnecessary. Looking back, we might pinpoint Mendelssohn's rediscovery of Bach as a pivotal moment, a foreshadowing of the modern curatorial period in which important new works are so scarce that musicians are forced to forage in the past in search of mislaid masterpieces.",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Now that the collections for next season have been presented in Milan, Paris and New York, it is clear that most of the design community has become obsessed with promoting overt seductiveness. In general, skirts are not only short, they are skintight. Necklines are low, often dangerously so. Shoulders are less padded, more rounded, occasionally even bare for day. The silhouettes of the new clothes emphatically emphasize breasts, hips and legs. Accessories accentuate the ''female,'' especially with charming but nonessential hats perched on top of many outfits. One of the favorite themes for fabrics is flower patterns, the kind that usually show up on decorators' chintzes. Of course, miles of more mainstream merchandise have also been shown, and will be out there to buy, but the fashion emphasis is definitely on the provocative.",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Although its validity as a harbinger of the moral climate that permitted Hitler's rise to power has been debated, its significance for the cinema as a bold stylistic departure into a realm of fantasy and expression has remained indisputable. As originally conceived by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, and directed for the silent screen by Robert Weine, the macabre story focused on an asylum director named Caligari who hypnotically controls Cesare, a side-show somnambulist, to commit murders. In presenting their idea for the film, the creators were determined that it should be photographed in an innovative way, employing avant-garde techniques of expressionism then in vogue on the German stage. Susan Mosakowski's new stage version of ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' which opened last Wednesday at the La Mama Annex, is -esthetically speaking - closing a circle begun seven decades ago.",1987-12-06T05:00:00+0000

All of us have done dumb things in our lives, and one of the dumbest I ever did was to miss the Metropolitan Opera debut of Kirsten Flagstad. It was a Saturday matinee performance on Feb. 2, 1935. In those Depression days I was the complete Wagnerite and missed no performance of importance. There was no money around and yet, somehow, it was always possible to raise the 75 cents for standing room in the family circle, or $1.50 for the parquet. (It was also possible to sneak in, but that is another story.) The debut of a new, unknown Norwegian soprano did not mean much to me. When the great Frida Leider made her debut in 1932 all of us were there. We knew about her. But Kirsten Flagstad? I had more important things to do that Saturday (though what they were I cannot remember). I did not even listen to the broadcast. That was the broadcast in which Geraldine Farrar, one of the intermission commentators, threw away her script and said something to the effect that the most thrilling thing in music had just taken place: a star had been born.",1987-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Gorbachev Blueprint: Remodeling the System,"Mikhail S. Gorbachev has announced several major domestic policy initiatives. Here are some of the programs and the progress so far in putting them into effect. Financing industry: Beginning Jan. 1, about 60 percent of Soviet factories will be required to pay their own way, the biggest step so far in decentralization of economic controls. Unprofitable companies will be cushioned by a bailout fund, so few bankruptcies are expected, but failure to produce will mean pay cuts for workers. Experiments so far have been confined to profitable enterprises. War on alcoholism: Prices of vodka have been nearly doubled and supplies and liquor store hours cut back. Some regions have eased up in response to complaints, but Soviet officials say the law has reduced alcohol consumption sharply and increased life expectancy. Soviet officials said recently that arrests for home distilling of spirits had increased fivefold since the crackdown began in 1985. Price Controls: Since Communist Party leaders agreed in July to roll back central price controls, the prospect of higher prices has led to hoarding and angry letters. Officials say that they plan to relax controls on wholesale prices between now and 1990, but that ending the subsidies on food and other consumer goods will come later, after extensive public discussion. Cooperatives: A series of new laws taking effect in the last year have permitted small groups to set up cooperative restaurants and cafes, taxis, recycling centers and other enterprises. The press still reports bureaucratic resistance. Competitive elections: Responding to a proposal by Mr. Gorbachev in January, voters in some of the elections for local government office last summer chose from among competing candidates for the first time. The system is to be expanded for the next local elections, in 1990. Beginning in January, workers in most factories and farms will vote for their bosses. Mr. Gorbachev proposed competition in party elections as well and the press reported many experiments, but lately there has been little mention of multicandidate elections in the party. Stalin's victims: On Nov. 2, Mr. Gorbachev announced a commission to resume the rehabilitation of those wrongly accused and punished during Stalin's repressions. The process started under Nikita S. Khrushchev, but stopped when he was ousted in 1964. Individual businesses: A law that took effect May 1 allows individuals to moonlight as repairmen, tailors, taxi drivers and the like. Many moonlighters prefer to keep operating without a license. Family farming: Many state and collective farms now have greater freedom to decide what to plant, and to sell more of their produce for market prices. Mr. Gorbachev is pushing to spread family farming, with each family plot tied to a large state farm for its seed, tractors, and fertilizer. Farm production has improved, but much production rots because of poor storage and transport. Legal rights: A variety of new legal safeguards are under discussion, including changes in laws punishing dissent, a new law assuring reporters access to public documents and protecting against reprisals, and measures to increase rights of criminal defendants and reduce the use of the death penalty. None of these laws have been published. A law enacted in July gives citizens broader rights to appeal violations of their rights by public officials. History: Government commissions are rewriting school textbooks, the official Communist Party history, the history of World War II and other books, reportedly to fill in ''white spots'' and restore some official nonpersons to their place in history. Quality control: A state system of quality control has been introduced at 1,500 enterprises and is to be expanded in the fight against shoddy products. The plan has caused some resentment because rejected goods do not count toward worker bonuses, and has also produced drops in production at major factories. Joint ventures: Under a law published in January, foreign companies may own up to 49 percent of joint business ventures with Soviet enterprises. Fifteen companies from capitalist countries have signed contracts, including one American company, Combustion Engineering, which will produce equipment for petroleum processing. Scores of joint ventures have been set up with other Communist countries.",1987-12-07T05:00:00+0000

''I'm through practicing,'' he said. ''Next semester I'll be in another school. I spoke with Coach Carnesecca and he said that he understood.'' Broadnax, who averaged 38.9 points a game in his senior year at Fort Walton Beach (Fla.) High School, said he had been misled during the recruiting process by Coach Lou Carnesecca and his assistants, Ron Rutledge and Brian Mahoney. ''They said that I was going to play, that they wouldn't recruit over me, and that myself and Elander Lewis were the future of St. John's basketball,'' Broadnax said. Carnesecca has confirmed the promises to Broadnax, but said that when Michael Porter said he wanted to come to St. John's along with Greg (Boo) Harvey, the coach had no choice but to take him. Porter and Harvey were regarded as the nation's best junior-college backcourt while at San Jacinto. With Harvey and Porter starting for the Redmen, and Lewis and Steve Shurina playing behind them, Broadnax had played in only two of the team's four games. . . .

us,Q&A,"Q. The rainwater from the gutters around my house drains into a dry well, but I don't know exactly where this dry well is. For the last couple of years, in every heavy rain, water penetrates the cement-block wall of my playroom, which is five feet below ground. I believe the dry well is clogged and not draining properly. Can it be cleaned out without digging down and opening it? A.It is also possible that the underground pipe connecting the dry well to the downspout is clogged or damaged. The only way to determine this is to uncover the drainpipe. That way you will also find out where the dry well is. To clean out a dry well, you have to dig down and uncover the top of it. In many cases this is impractical, so it is often easier just to dig a new dry well. Q.I am replacing some of the windows in my old house. I want to insulate the hollow spaces around the old frames where the chains and weights now fit, and I am thinking of using expanding foam, since the exterior trim cannot be removed and the interior trim would be difficult to remove. Since the foam comes in small cans, this would make it costly to use for these large spaces. Do you have any other suggestions? A.Even if the inside trim is ornate, I see no reason why it could not be removed. It is usually held on with nails and is fairly easy to pry off, but work carefully to avoid splitting the wood. You might have to do some minor plaster patching after the trim is replaced. With the trim removed it would be simple to fill cavities with fiberglass. But if you choose not to do this, you can use one of the expanding foams, as you suggest. Many marine-supply outlets and large building-supply dealers carry it in larger containers that would be less expensive than the smaller sizes stocked by most hardware stores. Q.We own a split-level house, and under the lower level there is a three-foot-high crawl space with a concrete floor. We would like to know if it is possible, or feasible, to excavate this crawl space to create a full-height basement. A.In most cases it is possible but quite expensive, especially where there is a concrete floor, which would have to be broken up first. You must call in an experienced architect or engineer to determine what must be done and then hire a contractor handle the excavation and to pour a new footing, foundation and floor.

Gorbachev. Page A1 Mr. Gorbachev is taking his case directly to the American people, sometimes assuming a conciliatory stance, while at other times the Soviet leader is combative. A1 How closely the President has tied has chances for achievement in his last 13 months in office to the Soviet leader is reflected in the summit meeting, according to political experts. A19 Raisa Gorbachev was asked by a reporter during a tour of the White House whether she'd like to live there. She replied, ''A human being would like to live in a regular home. This is a museum.'' A1 Many South Koreans are concerned that the military may intervene tocancel a presidential election next week or nullify its results if the opposition wins. A1 Peru's top soccer team was lost in the crash of a plane into the ocean off Lima. Peruvian navy officials said only one of the 43 people aboard was known to have survived. B19 A key Filipino fugitive was seized in a raid on a Manila townhouse. Military officials said the fugitive, Col. Gregorio Honasan, who led a revolt last August, was being interrogated. A3 Iran vowed to double its oil output and start an oil price war as the seven-year war in the Persian Gulf became the focus of a Vienna OPEC meeting. But the threat sounded hollow to many experts. D1 National A21-29, B16,B19,B21 Chicago factories would be saved from conversion to loft apartments and trendy shops under a proposal by planning officials in a city that has lost nearly half its industial employment since 1960. A1 Crash investigators found a gun in wreckage and said that a recording indicated that someone had barged into the cockpit just before the crash of a jetliner in central California that killed all 43 people aboard. B18 Two U.S. Navy airmen were killed and nine were injured when a polar exploration plane crashed and burned in Antarctica. Officials said the plane had crashed while trying to land. B19 Barring low-flying planes over much of the Grand Canyon was proposed by the Interior Department to preserve tranquility in the national park in an initiative that department officials said could set a precedent. B18 A host of miniature comets so small they have eluded detection are probably swarming through the inner solar system and their bombardments could account for many planetary craters, scientists said. A28 Taxpayers have three weeks left to take advantage of a wide variety of strategies that will make next April 15 less costly, including prepaying some expenses and picking the best time to sell investments. A1 Stock prices surged higher for a third consecutive day, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 34.15 points, to close at 1,902.52, but many traders remain wary of what they think may be a short-lived rally. D1 Heralding a new flu season, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have begun to document isolated discoveries of influenza viruses around the country. B20 Colicky infants are being aided by a rocking device that is also soothing their angry parents. Colic involves unexplained fits of crying at usually the same time daily in infants aged two weeks to three months. B20 Surgery trauma can be eased greatly by psychological preparation for it, studies are finding. B20 Coretta Scott King filed a suit demanding that Boston University be required to return a collection of her husband's papers. A22 Most decorating clients are bullish about investing in their homes despite the stock-market decline, but they have been sobered into thinking more carefully about quality and style. C1 Veto of deficit bill threatened A25 Jackson campaign getting more discipline A26 Gore pins hopes on big day A27 LaRouche reportedly duped by an aide A29 Washington Talk B12 A major test looms for House ethics committee Regional B1-15 Despite pressure by Mario Cuomo and Edward Koch to give the Mayor more control over the New York City school system, all the leading state legislators whose support is essential for the Governor's plan said they opposed it. A1 New middle-income L.I. housing is planned by more than two dozen employers who announced a partnership to build houses priced at $70,000 to $110,000 in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. B1 The Howard Beach case prosecutor charged that a gang of white teen-agers, yelling racial epithets in a night of ''terror and hatred,'' chased a black man to his death during an attack on three blacks. B3 4th graders visit Howard Beach trial B3 Larry Davis will be transferred from a New York City detention center to a Federal prison. The City Correction Commissioner, reversing himself, withdrew his opposition to the transfer of the murder suspect. B4 Robert E. Chambers Jr. may have been under the influence of marijuana at the time of Jennifer Levin's death in Central Park last year, according to court documents outlining prosecutors' plans.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1987","THE ECONOMY The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a record $17.6 billion in October as Christmas goods and other imports rose more than five times as much as exports. The result was far worse than analysts had expected and caused turmoil in the financial markets. The dollar fell to record lows against the yen and the mark, bond prices rose steeply and stocks fell. Imports of cars and oil contributed to the growing deficit. Many economists said they were more concerned about the slow rise of U.S. exports than by the increase in imports. The trade figures prompted fresh appeals by Democrats and organized labor for passage early in the new year of the trade bill pending in a Senate-House conference committee. The Reagan Administration acknowledged a setback but insisted that the figures were not as grim as they appeared. [ Page A1. ] Florida's Legislature repealed the tax on advertising and professional services, and Governor Martinez said he would sign the bill today. Many corporations and advertising agencies that had led the fight against the tax said the repeal would discourage other states from following Florida's attempt to tax services. The Legislature also raised the general sales tax to 6 percent, from 5 percent, to maintain revenues at current levels. [ A1. ] The Senate gave final approval to a deficit reduction package that includes $9 billion in tax increases. The package would put into effect a major portion of the budget compromise reached by Congressional and Administration negotiators last month. [ A27. ] Three men were convicted of tax fraud in what Federal officials said was the largest tax fraud case ever filed. They included Charles A. Atkins, sometimes known as ''the boy wonder of tax shelters.'' A Federal District Court jury in Manhattan found Mr. Atkins guilty of 28 counts of conspiracy and fraud. [ D1. ] A Federal land bank declared itself insolvent, the first ever to do so. The $2.4 billion Federal Land Bank of Jackson, Miss., said it had frozen deposits of borrowing farmers. [ D1. ] INTERNATIONAL The Federal Reserve and 11 foreign central banks reached a preliminary accord to increase the required capital base of banks. The accord is part of a two-year effort by the Fed and other American regulators to force higher capital cushions on banks that are taking greater risks in lending. It also reflects the global trend of closer coordination of regulatory policies. [ A1. ] OPEC suspended deliberations to allow mediation of the sharply divergent views of Iran and Iraq on production policies. But prospects of reconciliation appeared dim. [ D1. ] Mikhail S. Gorbachev asked American business for help in improving the economic relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, now that political tensions have eased. [ A22. ] MARKETS The dollar plummeted to its lowest levels since the 1940's amid heavy trading as dealers sold the currency in the wake of the unexpectedly bad report on the nation's trade deficit. Gold rose to its highest level in nearly five years, reaching $492.30 an ounce, up $7.80, on the New York Commodity Exchange. [ D1. ] Stock prices closed sharply lower after a seesaw session that reflected the bad news on the trade front. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.08 points, or 2.47 percent, to 1,855.44. In the three previous sessions, it had climbed 135.78 points. [ D1. ] Bond prices were battered, with the losses most pronounced among the longer-term Treasury maturities. [ D13. ] COMPANIES British Airways raised its bid for British Caledonian to more than $360 million in its fierce battle with S.A.S., which has offered $200 million for 26 percent of British Caledonian. [ D4. ] Revlon's chairman wants more of TW Services, the successor to Trans World, and is seeking U.S. clearance. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS There are various ways to shrink the nation's trade deficit, and all involve pain for the American consumer. But there may be some choice in concocting a recipe for the necessary ''bitter medicine,'' a leading economist says. Leonard Silk. Economic Scene.

(AP) TENNIS Edberg and Jarryd Win: Stefan Edberg and Anders Jarryd, the defending champions, recovered from an opening-day upset to beat Paul Annacone of the United States and Christo Van Rensburg of South Africa, 7-6, 6-3, 6-2, yesterday at the $200,000 Masters Doubles championship in London.",1987-12-11T05:00:00+0000
us,"Art: 'Fictions,' Views of the Future and the Past","''FICTIONS,'' the work of a critic, Douglas Blau, is one of the better curatorial performances of the season. A double-gallery exhibition of more than 40 paintings, drawings and photographs, at both the Curt Marcus Gallery and Kent Fine Art, ''Fictions'' reaches across the past three centuries to compare and contrast a variety of equally romantic realisms and world views. At Marcus, for example, it is possible to look at Thomas Anshutz's ''Dissecting Room'' from 1879 in the company of John Bowman's ''Heart of Stone'' (an operating-room scene from 1987) and a signed colotype of Thomas Eakins's masterpiece ''The Gross Clinic'' of 1876. At Kent, one encounters Elihu Vedder's ''Laboring in the Fields Before the Colossi of Memnon'' of 1891 (a startling yet seemingly straightforward painting of Egyptians harvesting wheat within distant view of the ruined colossi), and Mark Innerst's ''Memnon'' of 1984, which isolates the statues in the near dark of night.",1987-12-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Delayed Payment,"He had to wait more than 20 months, but Charlie Sifford has finally collected $100,000 for making a hole-in-one during the 1986 Johnny Mathis Senior Golf Classic. Sifford, who joined the Tour in 1962 at the age of 37, was awarded the prize money yesterday by a Federal jury in Los Angeles. The five men and one woman took three and a half hours before rendering a unanimous verdict in favor of Sifford, who had filed suit last May against B.P.J. Enterprises, the promoter of the tournament, and Freemont Indemnity Co., one of its sponsors. Jerry Roisman, Sifford's lawyer, said that the tournament sponsors had advertised that the first player to make a hole-in-one on the par-3 168-yard 15th hole at the tournament would win $100,000 and a new automobile. Sifford made the ace on March 28, but received neither the money nor the automobile at the time. Roisman said the sponsors refused to pay Sifford because they claimed the signs advertising the prizes for the hole-in-one had been torn down before Sifford played the hole. After Sifford filed suit last May, the sponsors gave the golfer the automobile, and on Thursday he received the remainder of his payments. ''It means a lot to me,'' Sifford said. ''It means peace of mind and a lot of anger gone. I've been angry ever since I made the hole-in-one.''",1987-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Gorbachev had established ''an entirely different relationship.'' The White House mood was a combination of exhaustion and exhilaration. Page 1 Strong differences on'Star Wars' remain between the United States and the Soviet Union despite President Reagan's assertion that the discussion about the issue was a victory for his position, officials said. 1 Mr. Gorbachev signals no change in the basic doctrines of the Soviet Union, Caspar W. Weinberger said. Mr. Weinberger remained one of the few in Washington immune to the Soviet leader's charm. 1 News analysis: Mr. Gorbachev was uncharacteristically cautious in handling substantive business during his visit. It reflects a more cautious approach by him on foreign and domestic affairs. 9 News analysis: The White House, where almost nothing has gone right for more than a year, seemed as if it had returned to the good old days. Still, not even the President's cheerful aides were confident the warmth would last long. 9 In private talks, humor and deep disagreements 8 Summit seen as helping Bush 9 Gorbachev gets big welcome in Berlin 10 NATO ministers praise treaty 10 South Korea's presidential campaign entered a climactic phase in a swirl of warnings about violence and charges that brutality and fraud were being used to win votes. The campaigns grew nastier on all sides. 1 Legislation about covert operations that would require Presidents to tell Congress about such operations within 48 hours is opposed by the Administration, which says it could impair the conduct of foreign affairs. 11 Four Haitian presidential candidates united in opposition to the army-dominated provisional Government and, in a hardening of their position, demanded that the Government step down. 3 Pretoria curbs freed rebel 3 Buenos Aires journal: Peronism without Peron 4 Tense mood on warship in Persian Gulf 5 Three more Palestinians killed by Israeli troops 6 U.N. panel asssails Congress on P.L.O. 6 NATIONAL 12-14, 32 A.H. Robins must reserve $2.5 billion in its bankruptcy reorganization plan to compensate fully the women injured by its Dalkon Shield birth control device, a Federal judge ruled. 1 In the Texaco-Pennzoil case, a group of Texaco shareholders said it had agreed with Pennzoil on a $3 billion settlement plan that it hoped would end the two companies' dispute. 1 Cubans held in American prisons will have their cases heard under a new process established by the Administration to determine if they should be sent back to Cuba. But lawyers for the inmates said the procedures are inadequate. 12 The deadline for clean air standards would be delayed eight months under a measure that was approved by the Senate as it began debating a $606 billion omnibus appropriation bill. 13 The American frontier lives in all its harshness, a loosely knit group of academics and public officials are arguing. They say the vast open spaces of the West need to be viewed differently from other rural areas. 13 A growing demand for a white clay that is found in central Georgia has turned into a $500-million-a-year business. The clay is used for ceramics, plastics and as a coater. 12 The Deaver jury began deliberating after it was told to disregard defense claims that Michael Deaver's alcoholism led him to forget the lobbying improprieties he was accused of falsely denying. 14 Lawsuit against anti-abortion group is settled 12 Education aide assails proprietary schools 13 Pope clears way to beatify priest 13 Senate approves new Labor Secretary 14 PTL ministry owes $61 million in taxes, court papers say 32 REGIONAL 33-36 A woman withdrew a complaint that a judge had ordered her on her hands and knees to re-enact a rape. She said the Brooklyn District Attorney's office had coerced her into making the false accusation. 1 A blood test on a homeless woman who was the first street person involuntarily hospitalized under a Koch administration program found that she was not suffering from a medical ailment as had been suggested by city doctors. 35 Less money for housing the homeless in New York and other cities will be available from the Federal Government. The Government plans to pay for only 30 days of a family's stay in a welfare hotel or shelter. 33 News analysis: Board of Education revisions suggested in New York City have led some educators to say that by focusing on who should control the Board, the City is stressing governance at the expense of change inside the schoolhouse. 35 The judge in the Howard Beach trial refused the request of a jury deliberating the fate of four white teen-agers charged with murder or manslaughter to visit the scene of an attack on three black men a year ago. #35 A $2 billion development of offices, stores and apartments will be built in New Jersey by the Colgate-Palmolive Company on the Hudson River site where it has manufactured soap since 1847, the company said. 33 AIDS patients in dire need finding solace 33 New York City jails: System in turmoil 33 Hems are up, sort of 33 Rise in health charges upsets towns 34 Not guilty plea given in Queens car-racing death 34 Neediest Cases 36",1987-12-12T05:00:00+0000

Sayers adaptations, with Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter Wimsey, the series is now returning to Agatha Christie's Miss Marple stories, once again starring Joan Hickson as the venerable but dogged sleuth.

''Nemesis,'' published in 1971, was the last of the Miss Marple novels. The story begins as, in Miss Marple's words, a crossword puzzle without any clues. Her old friend Jason Rafiel, a cockney millionaire, has died and left instructions in his will for Miss Marple to ''investigate something.''

us,ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS: GIVE THE BIG PICTURE,"THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery. By C. D. B. Bryan. (Abrams, $45.) If any American institution merits a five-and-a-half-pound $45-birthday card celebrating its centennial, it is the National Geographic Society. The society's superbly produced flagship magazine has guided generations of Americans from the benthos to the cosmos and is, I warrant, the only periodical regarded as impossible (if not downright illegal) to throw away; tons of issues are passed down like family heirlooms. The society wisely chose an outsider to document its history: C. D. B. Bryan (the author of ''Friendly Fire'' and other books), who, with felicitous anecdote and meticulous detail, has written an engaging account of the Geographic's growth from a charter membership of 165 with practically no assets to an international juggernaut with 11 million members in 170 countries and annual revenues of more than $350 million. He confronts forthrightly the most common criticism of the magazine: that, until relatively recently, it sedulously avoided controversy, ignored such unpleasantness as poverty and reported only the sunny side of war. Optimism, he points out, was the magazine's mandate. One of the guiding principles set down by Gilbert H. Grosvenor, the society's director in the first years of this century, was that ''only what is of a kindly nature is printed about any country or people, everything unpleasant or unduly critical being avoided.'' As good as the writing is, however, readers may delight most in the profuse illustrations, for, as befits a biography of a magazine whose photography has no peer, the anniversary tome is replete with pictures both fascinating and breathtaking. In all, the birthday book is, like the ''new'' Geographic itself, exhaustively researched, gracefully and precisely written and splendidly illustrated.",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

But Alex English of the Nuggets, who finished with 30 points, connected on a jump shot from the side and Vincent hit a layup and a free throw to put Denver ahead by 125-116 with 52 seconds remaining.

Cutting through Mr. Altman's customary melange of aleatory dialogue, strange epiphanies and subtle plot mysteries, one can state with fair certainty that a spirited but exceedingly odd young woman, Prudence (Julie Hagerty), has answered a personals ad; she meets the ad's originator, Bruce (Jeff Goldblum), who reveals that he is a bisexual living with his male lover Bob (Christopher Guest).",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

There is a sense in which all politics on television has elements of a game show, but the NBC program, ''America's Future: A Presidential Debate,'' set a house record. Candidates were restricted to one-minute bursts, while sitting in what looked like a jury box.

I have been fortunate enough to visit Berlin twice and stay with close friends who live there. I have also toured extensively in East Germany. On my most recent visit to East Berlin, I was taken to the Weissensee cemetery one Sunday afternoon. As a Jew, I was deeply touched by my visit. I received a powerful understanding of the large German Jewish community, especially in Berlin. I was able to see with my own eyes by reading the gravestones how strong the Jewish community was in Germany up until the coming to power of the Nazis. I have also traveled to Prague and seen the old Jewish cemetery there. There is no comparison as to the magnitude of the Weissensee cemetery. While Berlin was destroyed, it is amazing that the cemetery was untouched. The article failed to mention that there is a very small Jewish community in East Germany today and that most of the 600 Jews (according to official statistics) live in East Berlin. A small number of Jews also live in Leipzig. There is even a kosher butcher in East Berlin. The eight Jewish congregations in East Germany, small though they may be, receive considerable support from the state. HOWARD B. MARCUS Hoboken, N.J.",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Answer: It is not easy, one of the race officials explains, to estimate accurately when the winner and his or her dogs will cross the finish line until the leaders are about 200 miles from Nome. That is usually a couple of days or so before the winner's arrival. The dog-sled event begins next March 5 from Anchorage. Many enthusiasts in Alaska follow the progress of the race on the radio and in newspapers and head for Nome as quickly as they can when the day of the finish appears to be obvious. A resident of the Lower 48 might consider checking with Alaska by phone during the race - with the Iditarod Trail Committee, for example - to obtain a good estimate of when the first dog team is expected and when to fly to Nome.",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Meanwhile, Larry had arrived at a new appreciation of Mayan culture. Not only did the Mayans conceive of the mathematical zero and the mathematical infinite, not only did they work out a calendar of marvelous accuracy, not only did they know everything there is to know about the fascinating topic of maize cultivation, but they also built these most magnificent pyramids, which are somehow a breeze to climb, at a brisk pace, no hands, but which scare the life out of you once you start thinking about going down.",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"MAMA, by Terry McMillan. (Washington Square Press/ Pocket Books, $5.95.) Mildred Peacock, the protagonist of this novel about a poor black family in a decaying suburb of Detroit, finds many ways to transcend poverty -alcohol, prostitution and plain, hard work. ''In its inexorable movement toward economic doom, 'Mama' [ proves ] that dignity can't be carried in a wallet,'' Will Blythe said here earlier this year. ''Mildred Peacock slaps the forces of economic determinism clean upside their hoary heads.'' ADAM'S TASK: Calling Animals by Name, by Vicki Hearne. (Vintage, $8.95.) Vicki Hearne, a poet who trains horses for a living, believes that animals are sentient, moral beings that should neither be condescended to nor treated as though they were machines. While our reviewer, Yi-Fu Tuan, said last year that he found the author's anthropomorphizing a bit extreme, he thought much of the book was ''illuminating and educational.'' ''She believes profoundly in the intelligence of the animals she trains, in their vocation to fulfill themselves as beings of courage, responsibility and wisdom.'' NEVER COME MORNING, by Nelson Algren. (Four Walls Eight Windows/Consortium Booksales and Distribution, $7.95.) When Nelson Algren's novel about a young Polish boxer on Chicago's rough West Side was published in 1942, Fred T. Marsh said here that it was ''a brilliant book.'' This new edition includes an introduction by Kurt Vonnegut and a 1962-63 interview with Algren, who complains about how badly he was treated by Hollywood. THE PHYSICISTS: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America, by Daniel J. Kevles. (Harvard University, $12.95.) In the name of their god, pure science, America's physicists have long expected society to love them and support their multimillion-dollar experiments, Daniel J. Kevles shows in his study of a scientific elite. In 1978, John Leonard said in The Times that ''with a sharp eye for the telling anecdote, Mr. Kevles paints a picture of aristocrats who [ believed ] everything that is any good will 'trickle down' from those who know better to those who know nothing.'' TO SKIN A CAT, by Thomas McGuane. (Vintage, $5.95.) Boxed in by a modern world in which there are no more frontiers, some of the characters in Thomas McGuane's short stories become ridden with angst, others erupt into violence. Sometimes ''this nasty behavior seems gratuitous and unearned,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. But ''the finest stories in this volume . . . have the sad-funny, sad-surreal texture of daily life.'' PRESENT AT THE CREATION: My Years in the State Department, by Dean Acheson. (Norton, $12.95.) For those who would understand the web of alliances and threats - both real and imagined - that constitutes our present world, Dean Acheson's memoirs have long been considered indispensable. As he describes his role in helping to create United States foreign policy during the cold war, Acheson ''makes us privy to one of the best-trained and resourceful minds that has ever been put at the service of the nation,'' Wallace Carroll said in The Book Review in 1969. GOLDEN DAYS, by Carolyn See. (Fawcett, $3.95.) Carolyn See's perversely titled novel is about Southern Californians during the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The story is ''defiantly rude and hilariously sad,'' Carol Sternhell said in The Book Review last year. ''In its weird way, this may be the most life-affirming novel I've ever read.'' THE HARVEST OF SORROW: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine, by Robert Conquest. (Oxford University, $9.95.) From 1929 to 1933, millions of peasants died during the Soviet Union's forced collectivization of agriculture and the famine that followed. Robert Conquest ''has chronicled [ one ] of the great Russian tragedies of the 20th century,'' Craig R. Whitney said here last year. ''This is a powerful story.'' HAVING EVERYTHING RIGHT: Essays of Place, by Kim R. Stafford. (Hepworth/Penguin, $6.95.) This celebration of the Northwestern United States is ''written in a vivid, succinct prose that sparkles with imagery,'' our reviewer, John Tallmadge, said last year. The author ''is particularly attracted, as were Thoreau, Whitman and the Beat poets, to eccentrics and outcasts, the people he calls 'local saints.' '' FLOATER, by Joseph Koenig. (Mysterious Press, $3.50.) When a con man who seduces and kills rich women meets up with his female counterpart, they go into business together. This is a ''fast-paced book, well plotted, with a devastating ending,'' Newgate Callendar said here earlier this year. Joseph Koenig ''has written a splendid procedural expressed in sharp, economical, yet sensitive prose.'' THE CREATION OF PATRIARCHY, by Gerda Lerner. (Oxford University, $8.95.) Men's subordination of women is rooted in history, not biology, and thus it is something that can be changed, the feminist scholar Gerda Lerner argues. Last year one reviewer said that her book ''gives us a grand historical framework that was impossible even to imagine before the enlightenment . . . provided by her earlier work and that of other feminist scholars.'' LILIAN'S STORY, by Kate Grenville. (King Penguin, $6.95.) This first novel about an obese Australian girl's escape from her sick, incestuous father and other horrors of life ''is a work of considerable beauty and power,'' James Purdy said in The Book Review in 1986. ''Indeed, her fat itself comes to be a kind of strength of being, a true aura, the authentic envelope of her soul.''",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.

(Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $24.95 until Jan. 1; $29.95 thereafter.) The nostalgia of city dwellers for life in the country will be well-fed by this delectable coffeetable book, a collaborative effort by the husband and wife team of Reeve Lindbergh and the photographer Richard Brown. Noel Perrin's introduction defines the area under scrutiny - the Northeast Kingdom, that upper-right-hand corner of Vermont where it abuts New Hampshire and Canada and cows heavily outnumber people. Mr. Brown is my favorite upcountry artist with a camera. His photographs have such crisp luminosity I think I would recognize them anywhere. Uniquely, he captures the quality of northern light, whether it's the beatification of a curly Dorset sheep or the stunning blow of sunlight hammering the east face of a snowed-in farmhouse. These pictures may occasionally idealize, but they do not cloy. Mr. Brown's authentic pigs, goats, hens and horses lift the spirit. Those who face the winter down with wood stoves, salute spring with maple taps and new lambs or foals, will appreciate the few glimpses and black humor Reeve Lindbergh's text allows.

To substantiate the charge, the young Chopinist included a privately recorded tape of his own version, which he challenged me to compare, note for note, measure for measure, with that of the more famous artist. The tape documented an obviously spliced performance of this gusty, rather spooky movement that was indeed remarkably precise.

us,ILLUSTRATED BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS: GIVE THE BIG PICTURE,"DANCE AND PHOTOGRAPHY. By William A. Ewing. (Holt, $50.) William Ewing's primary interest in photographs of dance lies neither in performance preservation nor in star adulation but in something more profound: the craft, sensuality and intelligence framed within each individual image. The author presents more than 200 full-page exquisitely reproduced images by such artists as Brassai, Genthe, Steichen, Man Ray, Degas, Nadar and Walker Evans, all of them connected by the subject of dance - primitive, avant-garde, spontaneous, classical. Mr. Ewing's thoughtful essay traces the history of dance through its great innovators - Marie Taglioni, Isadora Duncan, Nijinsky, Martha Graham, Balanchine - alongside the development of the photograph from the first attempts by Daguerre in the early 19th century to the highly refined but sometimes less imaginative techniques used by photographers today. The wonderful paradox of dance photography - the recording of movement by freezing it - is outlined with vivid force. But the reproductions, some familiar, many not, speak for themselves: the wit of George Platt Lynes's portrait of the young Balanchine as a deity of carpentry; the perverse horror of Duncan peacefully poised in a car, wearing the scarf that strangled her; the intensity of Rudolf Nureyev's hips and legs, photographed by Irving Penn, tells the whole powerful story of this dancer and of the classical dance discipline. The boldness of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn implanting themselves in the landscapes of Yosemite's natural wonders is awesome, amusing and American. And there are the quieter moments: Anna Pavlova's neck inextricably entwined in a swan's, and the soft sexiness of Ginger Rogers's naked back draped in chiffon, photographed by Horst. The cumulative effect of this book is one of confirmation; nothing is more beautiful - or eccentric or entertaining - than the human body when it is shaped by its dancing spirit.",1987-12-13T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Hume offers three points to consider when choosing interior plants for decoration: their foliage color, their leaf texture and their flower color. He tells exactly where to place particular plants in a home so they grow best. If plants need humidity, such as ferns do, place several on a tray of gravel and tuck a glass of water out of sight to be sure there is enough moisture in the air. He also reminds hobbyists of many growing techniques, such as pinching plants back - a sort of finger pruning to keep plants shapely.

Hextall was assessed two penalties 21 seconds apart during the Flyers' 4-3 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday. He was first detected tripping the Jets' Andrew McBain, and then Referee Dan Marouelli called a penalty on Hextall for delaying the game after his attempted clearing pass went over the glass. While he agreed with the latter penalty, Hextall claimed self-defense in flattening McBain. ''McBain gave me a whack and he whacked me all night so I gave him one back,'' said Hextall, who is as mild-mannered off the ice as he is tenacious while playing. Hextall's reputation as an aggressive competitor started last year in his rookie season when he logged 104 minutes in penalties, a N.H.L. record for goalies. He also sat out the first eight games of this season after being suspended for a vicious two-handed slash on the Edmonton Oilers' Kent Nilsson in the Stanley Cup final.",1987-12-15T05:00:00+0000

If the two-dimensional character of Turandot can somehow, in addition, be projected with more than a bulldozer's nuances, all the better.

Huffman broke a 2-2 tie at 8 minutes 48 seconds of the second period when he tapped in Pelle Eklund's pass for his second goal of the season. Howe scored on a power play at 18:19 when he backhanded Peter Zezel's rebound past Gilles Meloche, the goaltender, from close range. It was Howe's 100th goal, making him the first Philadelphia defenseman to reach that level. Murray Craven had three assists for the Flyers and scored his 10th goal of the season into the empty net with :02 left.

The new formula is aimed at making cross-country races more spectacular and more interesting. Nordic events have usually been raced against the clock, individually. Mogren finished ahead of his teammate, Gunde Svan, a former Olympic and world champion. Mogren finished in 1 hour 16 minutes 11.7 seconds and Svan in 1:16:12.2.

us,Q&A,"Q.In winter, condensation forms and a mildew smell develops in our attic. We also get a lot of moisture in the bathroom, and algae on the walls. Do we need vents in the attic? A fan in the bathroom? A.It sounds as though you need both. The vents should be at opposite ends of the attic, to insure cross ventilation. If possible, there should also be vents in the eaves, to allow air to flow in at the bottom of the attic and travel up above the insulation. The vents must be large enough to provide at least one square foot of free opening for every 300 square feet of attic floor. Q.I am redoing a house that has a concrete-slab floor covered with carpet. I have taken up the carpet and plan to put a new one down, but in sweeping the old surface I find that dust keeps coming up. I am afraid the dust will come up through the new carpet. Is there anything I can do to stop this ''shedding''? A.You can apply a clear concrete sealer, using either a mop or a roller. Safe and easy to apply, sealers are sold in most paint stores, as well as in many masonry supply houses. Q.We have a tiled shower stall on our first floor. The tiles, as well as the grout, seem to be in good shape. However, the exposed wood beams in the basement directly under the shower are wet. A plumber said that the lead pan under the tiles in the shower has developed a leak, and that the only way to repair it is to rip out the entire shower. Is there any other way to fix this, like applying a clear sealer or installing a plastic pan on top of the tile? A.I'm afraid not. The tile floor of the shower must be torn up to get at the pan so it can be replaced. But you do not have to rip out the whole shower; only the floor. Q.We have a brick patio that has some dark areas, and others with algae. We want to clean this, but do not want to use anything that will harm the plants around the patio. What do you recommend? A.The most effective cleaner for this is trisodium phosphate (TSP), which is sold under various brand names (Soilax and Savogran TSP are two). If TSP is forbidden in your area, then use a strong powdered detergent. Scrub a section at a time, then rinse it off before it can dry. If you are careful, little of the cleaner will get on the plants, except for what is washed off. If you use plenty of water, this should cause no harm. For the algae, buy an algaecide at a swimming pool supply outlet and follow the directions on the package. Q.I think the linoleum flooring in one of my rooms has a terrazzo brick floor beneath it, which I want to expose. How can I remove the present floor covering? A.I don't know what you mean by ''terrazzo brick.'' Terrazzo is a seamless concrete floor with colorful chips of stone or marble embedded in it. It is polished by machine to a smooth high gloss. Brick is not smooth or glossy, and it has many mortar joints.",1987-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: For Wine Lovers,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. OYSTER BAR AND RESTAURANT, Grand Central Terminal, lower level, 42d Street and Vanderbilt Avenue (490-6650) - **(Sept. 13, 1985) The grandeur of the sprawling main dining room with its tile walls and vaulted ceiling is reminiscent of the heyday of rail travel. The restaurant's wine list is renowned for its selection of California whites, more than 100, at reasonable prices. (Fewer than half a dozen token reds are available.) Oyster fans should begin with a sampling from the dozen exquisitely fresh varieties posted, or you might start with the milky and chunky New England clam chowder. The pan-roasted shellfish are terrific, whether oysters, sea scallops, shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels or the works; bouillabaisse, a house specialty, is a standout. The long list of mostly broiled fish fillets changes daily, according to availability, and they are consistently pleasing. Entrees $12.85 to $25.95. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. (last seating); closed Saturdays and Sundays. RIVER CAFE, 1 Water Street, Brooklyn (718-522-5200) - ***(July 25, 1986) With its stunning views of Manhattan and the East River, this restaurant offers a romantic atmosphere for even the most jaded, and it has some of the most provocative food in the city. The River Cafe also has one of the better wine lists in town, particularly strong in American selections. Starter options are smoked salmon, grilled vegetable lasagna with basil oil, and chilled duck foie gras with dressed lentils and endive puree. Entrees include soy-and-honey marinated squab with potato pancakes, sauteed veal chop with Chinese mustard, and grilled yellowfin tuna with mushroom salad. Dinner prix fixe $48. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 7 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 3 P.M. and 7 P.M. to midnight. SOFI, 102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street (463-8888) - **(May 22, 1987) This graceful restaurant south of the Flatiron district occupies a soaring loft space that has been warmed with paintings, rugs and soft lighting. The menu is cross-cultural, as many as 20 wines are offered by the glass, and the list of remarkably inexpensive bottles is imaginatively assembled to match the food. Appetizers include a cassoulet terrine; buffalo mozzarella with roasted marinated tomatoes, and endive, beet and mache salad with walnut oil vinaigrette. For a main dish, options are sauteed red snapper fillet with artichokes and roasted tomato puree; roasted breast of Muscovy duck with tapenade and endive confit, and lobster served out of the shell with a lobster sauce. Dinner entrees $16 to $28. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. ''21'' CLUB, 21 West 52d Street (582-7200) - **(June 19, 1987) The patrician town house is more beguiling than ever, and the food is vastly improved since the refurbishing. The renowned wine list has ample selections in the $20-to-$30 range. The upstairs dining room is warm and welcoming, and appetizer choices include sauteed foie gras with deep-fried cellophane noodles in veal stock sauce, gratin of salt cod under Parmesan crust, and butterflied pan-fried shrimp in herb butter. Recommended main dish options are Kentucky bourbon steak with four kinds of peppers; grilled turbot with red pepper and saffron sauces; Black Angus steak in hot mustard crust. Dinner entrees $24 to $39. Dining room: Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2 P.M. and 5:30 to 9:30 P.M. Barroom: Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight. Closed Sundays. UNION SQUARE CAFE, 21 East 16th Street (243-4020) - **(Jan. 24, 1986) A low-key restaurant with comfortable dining rooms, Union Square features many good wine selections in the lower price range, and it is one of the few restaurants in town to offer a number of good dessert wines by the glass. The menu straddles the border between France and Italy; starter options include seared sea scallops with fried angel hair pasta in creme fraiche and garlic sauce; duck breast with sliced winter pears. For a main dish you might choose bouillabaisse with saffron-aioli croutons; osso bucco with orange, honey cognac and orzo, or the seared rib eye with rosemary, spinach and fagioli. Entrees $15.50 to $21. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight; closed Sundays. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD, 1 World Trade Center, 107th floor (938-1111) - *(July 4, 1986) Perched a quarter mile up atop the World Trade Center is the highest and grandest dining room of them all - glass enclosed with a wraparound view of the city and harbor. The wine list at Windows is justly famous, not only for its wide selection of French and American labels but also for its reasonable prices. You might begin with salmon and snapper, lightly grilled with orange and chive sauce; pate of wild boar with morels, and oysters and clams on the half shell with two sauces and freshly grated horseradish. Main dishes are baby pheasant marinated in wild thyme with autumn succotash; medallions of veal tenderloin with morel sauce; corn pancakes; sauteed large shrimp with fennel and leek custard, and rack of young lamb. Dinner prix fixe $29.95 to $33.95. Fridays and Saturdays, 5 to 10 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 7:30 P.M. What the stars mean, page C32.",1987-12-18T05:00:00+0000

Foreman, who held the heavyweight championship from January 1973 to October 1974, methodically pounded Sekorski with jabs and savage right hands before Referee Richard Steele stopped the bout at 2:48. Foreman (50-2 with 47 knockouts) showed only a little flab over his trunks at 244 pound as he patiently stalked the overmatched Sekorski (20-8). Foreman, who is coming back after a 10-year layoff, said he would like six more bouts before seeking a fight with Mike Tyson late next year. ''I want to fight for the championship of the world,'' Foreman said. (AP) College Basketball Kentucky 85, Miami of Ohio 71: Winston Bennett, a senior forward, scored 17 of his career-high 28 points in the second half last night to lead top-ranked Kentucky into today's championship game of the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, at Lexington. Kentucky (5-0) will meet North Carolina-Charlotte, a 78-63 winner over Middle Tennessee. Miami trailed by only 65-62 after Jim Paul sank a jumper from the lane with 8:58 left. But Kentucky's Rex Chapman connected on a 10-footer that began a 12-0 run. (AP) Villanova 83, La Salle 80: Tom Greis scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half, and hit two free throws with 21 seconds to go for Villanova to win the battle of city rivals in the first round of the Jostens Philadelphia Classic. The Wildcats will meet Wake Forest, an 82-72 victor over Canisius, for the title. Villanova held a 76-70 lead, but La Salle closed to 81-80 with 1:10 to go. Greis then converted his foul shots and La Salle (5-2) misfired on its final two attempts.(AP) Texas 99, Long Beach St. 85: Clarissa Davis scored 26 points and pulled down 13 rebounds to lead the top-ranked Texas Lady Longhorns (7-0) past Long Beach State (3-3). Texas surpassed 90 points for the sixth time this season. Doretha Conwell played for the first time in almost a year after a knee injury and scored 10 points for Texas. Penny Toler led Long Beach with 30 points.(AP) School Basketball Tolentine Wins in Hawaii: Malik Sealy, the 6-foot-7-inch forward headed for St. John's next year, scored 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead undefeated St. Nicholas of Tolentine to an 89-59 victory over the host school in the McDonald's-Iolani Prep Classic in Honolulu Thursday night. Sealy, who also had four blocks, two steals and three assists, played three quarters. There were four other players from the Bronx school in double figures: Brian Reese and Kenneth Beverly with 12 each and Jerome Holmes and Bo Paulle with 11 each. Tolentine (6-0) moved into the quarterfinal round today against St. John's of Washington, a 63-59 winner over Radford of Honolulu. Last night, St. Anthony's of Jersey City coasted past Leilehua of Honolulu, 105-43. Bob Hurley, a junior guard, paced St. Anthony with 21 points, 10 assists and 4 steals. Golf Baird and Johnson Lead: Butch Baird, a Senior PGA Tour player, and Chris Johnson, a Ladies Professional Golf Association player, combined for a seven-under-par 64 and a one-shot lead yesterday after the opening round of the Mazda Champions team tournament at the Tryall Golf and Beach Club in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

La-La Land is Los Angeles, where the discovery of a headless corpse helps a private investigator named Whistler uncover a pornography ring run by a seemingly respectable businessman with a voyeuristic taste for murder. ''Whistler is in many ways a very modern reincarnation of Hammett's Continental Op,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review last year. He called Robert Campbell ''one of the most stylish crime writers in the business.'' BROTHERS IN ARMS: A Journey From War to Peace, by William Broyles Jr. (Avon, $4.50.) Long after the Vietnam War had ended, the journalist William Broyles Jr., a former Marine lieutenant, felt nostalgia for what he considered his ''initiation into the power of life and death.'' Returning to the battlefield in 1984, he found that some of his former adversaries were just as wistful as he was and eager to reminisce. The conversations ''have a credibility born of mutual respect,'' Bill Kurtis said here last year. The author's ''journey was quite personal, but it speaks for thousands of men who are still troubled by the unsettled issues'' of the war. ENCHANTMENT, by Daphne Merkin. (Fawcett, $3.95.) Having grown up in the emotional icebox of an Upper East Side household, Hannah Lehmann feels chilled and smothered by her past. ''In the wrong hands, the inside story of the Lehmann family, dirty linen and all, could easily have made uncomfortable reading,'' The Times's John Gross said in 1986. ''Thanks to Daphne Merkin's subtlety and sureness of touch, it is a story that draws the reader on unresisting.'' FIDEL: A Critical Portrait, by Tad Szulc. (Avon, $5.95.) A skilled manipulator of the masses and the news media, Fidel Castro has managed to play off the United States and the Soviet Union against each other for three decades. Last year, Walter Goodman said in The Times that as a ''conscientious and fair-minded'' biographer, Tad Szulc ''provides as full an account of the rise . . . of [ the Cuban leader ] as any general reader could ask and more than some may require.'' MALCOLM, by James Purdy. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $7.95.) When James Purdy's novel about the slow corruption of a 15-year-old boy was published in 1959, our reviewer, William Peden, praised the author's ''talent for depicting the sickly, the abnormal, the blasted aspects of contemporary American life.'' The same publisher has reprinted Mr. Purdy's subsequent novel, THE NEPHEW ($7.95), in which the aunt of a soldier missing during the Korean War writes a memorial to him, learning in the process disturbing facts about the town where she lives. In 1960, R. W. B. Lewis said in these pages that the book was ''a small work of authentic fictional art.'' It reads ''as though some of the stories in 'Winesburg, Ohio' had been rewritten by Eugene Ionesco.'' CRISIS IN BETHLEHEM: Big Steel's Struggle to Survive, by John Strohmeyer. (Penguin, $7.95.) As the editor of The Globe-Times of Bethlehem, Pa., John Strohmeyer watched the fall of the once-powerful Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which he sees as emblematic of the problems faced by the industry as a whole. Last year, our reviewer, Steven Greenhouse, admired the book for conveying both the company's ''extravagant and insular corporate culture'' and ''the extraordinary physical dangers of steelmaking.'' THE GATES OF HELL, by Harrison E. Salisbury. (Da Capo, $12.95.) Harrison E. Salisbury, a former Times editor and foreign correspondent, based this novel on the life of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. When it was first published in 1975, one reviewer said the book's ''evocation of Russian history enthralls the reader. . . . Salisbury has written a moving and informative novel.'' TAKING THE WORLD IN FOR REPAIRS, by Richard Selzer. (Penguin, $7.95.) The surgeon-writer Richard Selzer is known for his essays about what physicians call ''invasive procedures.'' In his latest collection, which also includes some short stories, he moves beyond the operating table. ''As he palpates the world, listening for the tiny arrhythmias of despair, he jots down his observations with a surgeon's cunning and a stylist's zest,'' Diane Ackerman said here in 1986. PECKHAM'S MARBLES, by Peter De Vries. (McGraw-Hill, $4.95.) Earl Peckham, whose gloomy novel ''The Sorry Scheme of Things Entire'' has sold three copies, falls in love with the best-selling author Poppy McCloud, whose work he considers trash. ''The comedy . . . is less strenuous than in some of Mr. De Vries's other books,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. ''But the author still remains in a class by himself among contemporary comic writers.'' CRACKPOT: The Obsessions of John Waters, by John Waters. (Vintage, $5.95.) As director of the films ''Pink Flamingos'' and ''Polyester,'' John Waters prides himself on being a purveyor of bad taste. In this collection of essays, he occasionally lets down his facade, as when he describes his stint teaching at a prison institution for murderers, sex offenders and other hard-core criminals. ''Mr. Waters is far more interesting when he ditches the crackpot pose and writes from the heart,'' our reviewer, Anthony Schmitz, said last year. SEMITES AND ANTI-SEMITES: An Inquiry Into Conflict and Prejudice, by Bernard Lewis. (Norton, $7.95.) Historically, the Islamic world has not been infected with the anti-Semitic religious fervor of the Christian West, the historian Bernard Lewis writes. But he fears that the situation is changing. He wrote ''this provocative book to sound the alarm against what he sees as the deepest and most dire consequence of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' Arthur Hertzberg said here last year.",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Among the precious items stolen from her apartment were her only wristwatch and her birth certificate, so she does not know exactly how old she is, though she thinks she is close to 90. She also cannot remember when she took the long, rough boat ride to the United States from Poland, but she remembers why: the Cossacks made regular raids on her community, threatening the Jewish people, stealing their meager belongings and violating the sanctity of their religious practices.

In this small, richly peculiar novel, Elizabeth Jolley writes about money the way others write about love - lyrically, longingly, sensually. Money is the obsession of Margarite Morris, known as ''the Newspaper of Claremont Street'' or ''Weekly'' because of the petty gossip she picks up and passes along on her rounds cleaning houses in a small Australian town. Everyone on Claremont Street knows the gaunt old woman, the object of innocent fun and occasionally vicious jokes. If she can just save enough for a piece of land in the country she can free herself from all the people who cling to her and whom, for the most part, she despises. And so money becomes Weekly's passion; to her, it has ''the fragrance of roses and honeysuckle and fresh country air.'' Like many characters in Ms. Jolley's books, eight of which have been published here since 1984, Weekly is a bit barmy. In this expanded version of a short story from an earlier collection, Ms. Jolley fleshes out Weekly's character, giving her a Dickensian childhood, a stinker of a brother (shady Victor, whom she betrays to his criminal enemies), and a daily struggle to fend off her sense of shame and guilt.",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"INDOCHINE. By Christie Dickason. (Villard, $18.95.) A vivid sense of place and a thorough knowledge of Vietnamese culture distinguish this colorful if flawed first novel by an American-born director and choreographer who lived in Indochina in the 1950's. Christie Dickason's heroine, Nina Luoc, is the daughter of a Frenchwoman and a wealthy Vietnamese who sees her privileged life shattered in 1954 when her mother is killed and her father disappears in the wake of an explosion at their home. Stranded in the Saigon streets, Nina is rescued by a messenger from her father and initiated into the family opium trade. She rises to precarious fortune in the years of America's increasing involvement in Vietnam, jousting with rival drug lords and juggling two lovers, one an American journalist and the other a guerrilla who will stop at nothing to rid his country of the hated White Devils. ''Indochine'' is most notable for its characters' pragmatic, essentially amoral point of view, in which the Americans are simply the latest in a long line of foreign colonizers whose ignorant authority must be evaded or twisted to individual advantage. The author smoothly intersperses her narrative with necessary historical information, and she has a considerable gift for evoking the chaotic atmosphere of a war-torn nation. However, the plot, which is never more than serviceable, degenerates toward the end into an improbable series of confusing maneuvers that allow Nina to jet off into the sunset with no visible remorse and lots of cash. So many loose ends are left dangling in blatant anticipation of a sequel that this otherwise satisfying novel might just as well have closed with the words ''To Be Continued.''",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE CITY OF REFUGE: The Collected Stories of Rudolph Fisher. Edited by John McCluskey Jr. (University of Missouri, $25.) Although his work is little read today, Dr. Rudolph Fisher once held a prominent place among that pantheon of writers and artists whose reputations blazed during the Harlem Renaissance. And justifiably so, since his writing effortlessly captures the spirit and vitality of the Harlem he experienced in the 1920's and early 30's. Taken individually, the short stories collected in ''The City of Refuge'' show Fisher's remarkable command of both standard English and various dialects. One feels, smells and tastes his Harlem; its people come alive and one cares about them. Unfortunately, when read over a short time span, these parts seem to diminish the volume as a whole. They tend to follow the same depressing theme: Harlem crushing the spirit of the naive newcomer. In fact, there is only one somewhat positive piece, ''Ezekiel,'' in the 15 that make up this book. Most of Fisher's tales are about Southern immigrants coming to black America's Promised Land, Harlem, and how these honest, hard-working, God-fearing country people are swept away by the cynicism of the mean uptown streets. Fisher, a physician who died in 1934 at the age of 37, certainly deserves to be read, and this collection is as good a place to start as any. But I suggest you start slowly and take the good doctor in small doses.",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Cloth, $18.95; Paper, $9.95.) If you cross the F.B.I. campaign against the Black Panthers with Watergate, you would get some idea of the story told in this engrossing, if extremely complicated, work of investigative journalism. And in the post-Iran-contra era some of the darkest inferences of ''Requiem on Cerro Maravilla'' seem plausible, if scarcely proved. The narrative begins on July 25, 1978, when two radical proponents of Puerto Rican independence were killed by police in an apparent shoot-out at the base of a television tower that the two had apparently intended to sabotage. Within days the official police version of events began to unravel. After more than five years and innumerable hearings and court challenges, Puerto Ricans learned that the ''terrorists'' had been lured to the site by a police infiltrator, ambushed, and then executed at close range while kneeling and begging for mercy. The killing had then been covered up by the police and investigators. Manuel Suarez, who spent years running down every angle of the case for The San Juan Star, persuasively places the killing and the cover-up in the context of the bitter feud between statehood and independence forces in Puerto Rico. He also does a highly credible job of implicating then Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo in a truly Nixonian scheme to stonewall investigators, discredit opponents and manipulate the media. One of the most pressing questions raised by the case is whether or not the Carter Administration colluded in the cover-up, possibly in exchange for Governor Romero's endorsement in the 1980 Democratic primary. Mr. Suarez closes by calling for a grand jury investigation into possible obstruction of justice. But there is, he concedes, ''no hard evidence . . . that a deal had been struck.''",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

Then there were the carpets, made of wool, bought over mint tea in an old and magical house in the Tunis bazaar; and the painting of pheasants, done on mirror glass; and, at the end, after a chance turning through plantations of blue gum and pine, the unfurling of surf-scrubbed beaches at Cap Serrat, where there was no one and nothing save wind and white sand and the angry legions of the waves.",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE NEW BREED. By W. E. B. Griffin. (Putnam, $16.95.) This seventh volume of W. E. B. Griffin's ''Brotherhood of War'' series brings back many of the same characters whose military careers have been delineated in the first six. The series is in the platoon-movie genre - one of everything. There is, for example, the Jewish soldier who is both a decorated hero and an intelligence officer so good at his job that he hobnobs with President Johnson in the Oval Office. Also included is the spoiled rich kid who turns into a first-class officer. Earlier volumes were about fighting in World War II, postwar Greece, Korea and Vietnam. In all these conflicts, the adversaries were not only the historic ones but also the American brass who refused to consider the modern improvements being touted by the novel's intrepid band of military brothers, such as new tactics for armor and the helicopter. In ''The New Breed,'' the scene is the Congo in 1964, and again the enemy is a dual one: both the Congolese rebels, who are described in unrelievedly brutal terms, and the ''hand wringers'' in the State Department and C.I.A. who prevent fighting Americans from mowing down blacks to rescue American and Belgian hostages. What saves the book - and the series - from mediocrity is a generous ration of detailed and fascinating descriptions of weapons, tactics, Green Beret training, Army life and battle. The Brotherhood members themselves, although painted in primary colors, are still interesting characters and are usually possessed of intelligence and humor. Their womenfolk are also well drawn, but so brave and cheerful that they make one's teeth ache. In sum, ''The New Breed'' is absorbing, salted-peanuts reading. Mr. Griffin is an Army veteran himself, and his proficiency on the word processor convinces one that old soldiers never die, they just write away.",1987-12-20T05:00:00+0000

The Washington Opera revived it Saturday night as its first venture in the Kennedy Center's 1,000-seat Eisenhower Theater.

The victory, Tomba's fifth this season, gave him 125 points, 34 ahead of Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland. Zurbriggen, the defending World Cup champion, placed fourth here. Richard Pramotton finished second and Guenther Mader of Austria was third. Tomba, starting in the second group, was timed in 1 minute 46.35 seconds. Pramotton was clocked in 1:46.95 and Mader in 1:47.27. Tomba fell in the first heat of a giant slalom Saturday - his 21st birthday - ending his streak of four consecutive victories. The spill prevented Tomba from equaling the record of six straight victories set by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark during the 1977-78 season.(AP) Frenchwoman Is First: Catherine Quittet of France, returning from a serious knee injury, upset the Swiss favorites yesterday in Piancavallo, Italy, to win her first World Cup giant slalom.

She had the second-best time in the second run for a winning aggregate of 2 minutes 27.32 seconds.

(AP) HOCKEY Canada 2, West Germany 1: Ken Yaremchuk's goal at 13:05 of the third period gave Canada a victory over West Germany in the fourth round of the Izvestia tournament in Moscow.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1987","INTERNATIONAL The O.E.C.D. urged the U.S. and West Germany to take stronger steps to reduce their trade imbalances in order to restore market confidence and reinforce world economic expansion. The organization reserved its strongest criticism for Bonn in a report that predicted sluggish growth for the U.S. and other industrial nations in the next two years. However, the organization did not predict a recession. [ Page D1. ] Excessive changes in the dollar's value should be avoided, the U.S. and its major trading partners agreed. They said they would ''cooperate closely'' to that end. [ D1. ] Companies doing business in South Africa lost their tax credits in a little-noticed amendment to the revenue bill passed by Congress. [ B9. ] A spending bill passed by Congress includes sanctions that are expected to deprive Japanese companies of several hundred million dollars a year of business in the U.S. [ D13. ] Brazil may have fended off U.S. sanctions with reductions in curbs that it had placed on U.S. computers and software. [ D5. ] COMPANIES I.B.M. will join a leading supercomputer scientist in a venture to develop a new generation of supercomputers. Its partner is Steve S. Chen, former chief engineer at Cray. [ D1. ] Worlds of Wonder has filed for bankruptcy protection only a year after the toy maker was one of the fastest-growing companies in history. A dismal Christmas season didn't help matters. [ D1. ] A Federal judge gave 55 retailers an early Christmas present - a ruling that they are the classiest stores in America. That opinion came in the case of two competing fragrances, Passion and Elizabeth Taylor's Passion. [ D1. ] Three securities firms were designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They are Nikko, CRT Government Securities and Lloyds Government Securities. [ D1. ] Goodrich, which had no blimp, now has no tires: It has agreed to sell its 50 percent interest in Uniroyal Goodrich. [ D5. ] Jay A. Pritzker dropped his bid for Pan Am after the pilots union refused to go along with the $800 million in concessions he needed from a coalition of five unions. [ D5. ] THE ECONOMY The President signed a catch-all spending bill and another measure to limit the deficit, and Congress adjourned. [ A1 ] . The I.R.S. will not penalize taxpayers who had too little withheld from their paychecks this year. [ D2. ] Orders for durable goods edged up slightly in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of $111.09 billion last month. [ D5. ] MARKETS Stock prices lost ground, and traders blamed profit taking and nervousness about Middle Eastern developments. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.93 points, to 1978.45. [ D6. ] Oil prices rose sharply amid reports of OPEC production cutbacks and of military actions in the Persian Gulf. [ D12. ] The surge in oil prices eroded bond prices, causing intermediate and longer-term interest rates to rise. [ D13. ] The dollar was narrowly mixed in light pre-holiday trading. Gold rose $4.85, to $484.60 an ounce, in New York. [ D12. ] A Chicago Merc panel found no evidence that the futures markets accelerated the stock market's plunge on Oct. 19.

It estimated that the G.N.P. would rise by 2.4 percent after adjusting for inflation - more than a full percentage point lower than the 3.5 percent projection for next year that it made in August. The unemployment rate will hold steady, according to the forecast by Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. [ Page D1. ] Sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell 11.7 percent in mid-December from the year-ago period. But analysts said that the sales were strong and that the year-to-year comparison was misleading, because last year's sales were inflated by the effects of the impending change in the tax law.

us,Sports People; Slaney Sidelined,"Mary Decker Slaney, the nation's top female middle-distance runner but also the most injury-prone, will miss the 1988 indoor track season because of an injured right calf, her coach said yesterday. The coach, Luiz de Oliveira, said Slaney, who has not competed since last Feb. 28, when she set a course record of 32 minutes 3 seconds, in winning the Continental Homes 10-kilometer (6.2 miles) race at Phoenix, would ''take off the next 15 days and see how she reacts to the injury.'' He said, however, that the injury did not appear serious. But with the Olympics coming up next September, de Oliveira said it was not worth the risk of greater injury to compete indoors. Slaney, the American outdoor record holder at all distances between 800 meters and 10,000 meters, had planned to compete in three indoor meets - the Pacific Northwest Bell Indoor Games at Portland, Ore., Jan. 23; the Panasonic Millrose Games at New York Feb. 5, and the Vitalis-United States Olympic Invitational at East Rutherford, N.J., Feb. 13. ''Winning an Olympic gold medal is now the major goal in my career,'' Slaney was quoted as saying by Advantage International, her management firm. ''I don't want to risk any more injuries by racing indoors.'' The troublesome calf is the same one that Slaney injured during the 1985 United States Olympic Invitational - the last time she competed indoors. She missed the entire 1987 outdoor season because of surgery on her right Achilles' tendon.",1987-12-25T05:00:00+0000

Yet, the commission designated the buildings, at Central Park West and 95th Street, landmarks anyway. These empty buildings were undistinguished on the day they were built and remain so.

us,Noisy Advantage,"The crowd noise at the Metrodome during the World Series apparently helped the Minnesota Twins, according to a study published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the report ''Decibeldome,'' Dr. Steven Vincent, a Minneapolis family physician, tells how he wore a noise-measuring dosimeter to Game 2, when Minnesota beat St. Louis, 8-4. He compared his top reading of 125 decibels from a seat in the center-field upper deck to the sound of a jackhammer pounding concrete from a distance of 5 feet. Based on industrial research done elsewhere, the report said that the crowd noise was so loud that ''the lopsided score may be related to a fine motor and communication deficit that could have been caused by noise.'' A St. Louis fielder's dexterity may have been thrown off just enough so he couldn't catch a ball cleanly or throw it to first base in time, explained Thomas Hawkinson, an industrial hygienist at Medtronics Inc. and a co-author of the report.",1987-12-26T05:00:00+0000

New Year's Eve celebrants who seek Alexis Lichine's advice on serving Champagne will also learn that Art Buchwald likes bubbly ''because it always tastes as though my foot's asleep.'' Such tidbits explain why Mr. Lichine's encyclopedia, 20 years after it first appeared, remains popular. Now, newly expanded in its fifth revision, it gains complexity as it ages, like vintage Bordeaux. Wine lovers who savor the stylish reds the author makes at Chateau Prieure-Lichine in the Medoc village of Margaux can serendipitously ''sip'' hundreds of entries with pleasure. Though biased toward France, and devoting less attention to spirits than wine, this volume towers higher than ever over countless manuals that challenge but never threaten its supremacy as a virtual library in itself. For the amateur and professional, the 10 essays that form the book's backbone merit periodic rereading. They illuminate such basic topics as how wine is made, the history of wine, wine and food, the vine and spirit-making. Mystifyingly, the alphabetized definitions omit blush wines and West Germany's important trocken (dry) and halbtrocken (half dry) wines, and list minor chateaus separately while relegating E. & J. Gallo, the world's largest winery, to a subchapter. Impressively, seven pages are devoted to the viticultural and enological revolutions in New York State, which is shifting from sweet labrusca to dry vinifera wines. But why did Washington and Oregon together rate not quite four pages? Still, the index is subtle and the con-version tables are golden.",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE FLOOD. By John Broderick. (Marion Boyars/ Kampmann, $22.95.) Forget about plot. John Broderick's latest novel, ''The Flood,'' which is set during the 1930's in Bridgeford, Ireland (population 8,767), boasts such a colorful jumble of characters and voices one barely notices that its story is thin and inconsequential. In this community where drinking in a pub is ''as respectable as going to church,'' the townspeople crowd into the Cafe Royal. There they dawdle, talk and plot to bamboozle an Englishman named Hector Slyne, who wants to buy several parcels of land along the Shannon River, which flows through Bridgeford and, unbeknown to Slyne, floods its banks every winter. Benny O'Farrell, dubbed Fenny O'Barrell because of his majestic girth, presides over the bar and the town, stabilizing their flightier characters. And so, when ''Hosannah'' Braiden, Sarah Jane McLurry and Mrs. ''Pig'' Prendergast raise a ruckus over Slyne's attempt to withdraw from the land deal, it's Fenny who dispenses the drink and quiet wisdom that ease their fears. Keenly interested in all his characters' intricate interconnections and negotiations, Mr. Broderick depicts their strict and quirky provincial protocol in a masterly fashion, exposing the bulk of the interactions among these shopkeepers and servants as pure theater. ''The Flood'' presents nothing to contradict the stereotypical image of the Irish as a charming, hard-drinking, devious, witty and blarneying lot, whose attachment to their social rituals and to the auld sod creates wonderfully human and humorous moments. This is a first-rate comic novel, and its lush characterization and language richly recommend it.",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

Texaco's plan to emerge from bankruptcy calls for a $3 billion payment to settle Pennzoil's claim that Texaco' acquisition of Getty Oil wrongfully interfered with a Pennzoil takeover of the company. The plan will also require Texaco to pay creditors $2.5 billion. For Texaco, the plan relieves one set of pressures but sets up others. For one thing, the financial burdens will probably require Texaco to sell some assets. The largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn, has opposed the antitakeover provisions in Texaco's plan and this week he said he might file his own reorganization proposal. Mr. Icahn also disclosed that he had been contacted by parties interested in buying parts or all of Texaco. But for J, Hugh Liedtke, the chairman and Chief executive of Pennzoil, the settlemenat caps a 25-year career with the company.

Ranking the list internally in order to arrive at an ''album of the year'' would be as futile as the old apples-and-oranges comparison. The albums: Ornette Coleman, ''In All Languages'' (Caravan of Dreams) Andrew Hill, ''Shades'' (Soul Note) Live Skull, ''Dusted'' (Homestead) Roscoe Mitchell, ''The Flow of Things'' (Black Saint) Sonic Youth, ''Sister'' (SST) Russ Tolman, ''Totem Poles and Glory Holes'' (Down There/Restless) Townes Van Zandt, ''At My Window'' (Sugar Hill) Tom Verlaine, ''Flash Light'' (I.R.S.) Bunny Wailer, ''Rootsman Skanking'' (Shanachie) La Monte Young, ''The Well Tuned Piano'' (Gramavision) The La Monte Young and Ornette Coleman albums are watershed events, not just in the careers of two vitally important artists but in the development of late 20th-century music. Rock's pleasures are more immediate and visceral. Sonic Youth's ''Sister'' was the year's freshest, most intensely visionary rock-and-roll record. The Roscoe Mitchell and Andrew Hill albums were unexpected returns to peak form by two of the most determinedly individual voices in jazz. Townes Van Zandt and Russ Tolman spoke directly and eloquently from the heart.",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

Nevertheless, the jurors awarded the plaintiffs $16 million in punitive damages against the manufacturer, the Monsanto Company, for not ridding its product of dioxin, a potentially dangerous contaminant, and failing to warn the public about it.

It came at the onset of the year in the guise of a campaign by Chinese Communist Party conservatives against bourgeois liberalization, code for Western influence. Prominent intellectuals were disciplined. Hu Yaobang, the patron of the cultural ''openness'' policy that had given writers and artists more license than at any other time since the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, was ousted as the general secretary of the party. For writers and artists it was another of the recurring winters of silenced voices, unpublished manuscripts and exhibitions of vacuous art.

Jan. 29-30 The Republicans are scheduled for the first delegate selection, in Michigan state convention. The stakes: Bush stands to be embarrassed if Robertson does well. Feb. 8, Feb. 16 Iowa caucuses, N.H. primary. Winners get exposure and momentum. Dole must take Iowa. Dukakis, Hart each must win N.H. Only one can. Mar. 8 16 primaries make this a 'super Tuesday' of mostly southern and border states. Gore, a Southerner, counting on victories to establish himself as the center's candidate; with the black vote, Jackson expects to get more delegates than any of the others. Mar. 9 Field could narrow. Candidates with less than 10 percent in any two consecutive primaries will lose Federal matching funds in 30 days. Haig, du Pont, among others, may be at risk. Mar. 29 After three more primaries and a handful of caucuses, both parties will have picked over half their delegates, making, in theory at least, commanding leads possible. Illinois voting is a key test of industrial state sentiment. If Simon is still a player, he must take his home base. Apr. 2-19 Big-state voting continues. N.Y. primary especially could be key in a contested Democratic race. Cuomo looms over it all. Apr. 20 Democrats in Congress pick 253 of their number to be among 643 unpledged 'super-delegates.' Total convention votes: 4,160. Republicans send their governors, Congressmen and party officials to conventions through the regular electoral machinery. Apr. 26-May 3 Blockbuster primaries continue in Ind., Pa. and Ohio. More delegates than ever are picked by primaries this year. Democrats have them in 33 states, Republicans in 37. May 10-24 A small collection of Western contests will not yield a lot in delegates -only 107 in each party -but could yield a lot in headlines, and so help raise money for the last round, if either race is close. Sometime in June, probably Inter- and intra-party sniping may be replaced by displays of statesmanship as Reagan journeys to Moscow summit with Gorbachev. June 7 Four primaries end the season.

As a reporter who broke the story of the burial of poisonous chemicals beneath a residential community at the Love Canal, and in his subsequent book, ''Laying Waste,'' Mr. Brown was among the first to cry the alarm about toxic waste dumps. Now, in ''The Toxic Cloud,'' he is spreading the word about the ubiquitous, dangerous but virtually unaddressed problem of the pollution of our air by toxic gases. This book is essentially a Baedeker of foul air over the United States. It takes us from the dioxins spewed by chemical plants and heavy metals, to air reeking with volatile organic chemicals from refineries in the South; from the brown smog of southern California to the ''cancer alley'' stretching from Baltimore to New York City and, finally, to the acidified lakes and dying sugar maples of New England. Along the way, Mr. Brown gives us angry stories of ordinary people who suffered, grew sick and sometimes died because their air was poisoned. Aside from some simplified toxicology, he provides no detailed scientific explanations of the problem. He puts the blame on the usual suspects: ''arrogant'' industry and an uncaring, immobile government bureaucracy. He has not thought through a solution. But the book's cumulative evidence about tainted air and endangered communities is so compelling it may prod the public to demand that serious attention be paid to this national scandal.",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"NIGHT WITHOUT DAY. By Raphaele Billetdoux. Translated by Derek Mahon. (Viking, $14.95.) In this chronicle of a torturous three-day affair, the lovers' first meeting summons up ''the memory of a bruised pear . . . demanding anew to be eaten or thrown away.'' The burden of their first embrace ''was heavy, but they took the weight of it in their legs, they clung to each other, they concentrated harder, their clenched fingers hurting.'' Two questions persist: Does love have to be this excruciating? And could Billetdoux possibly be the author's real name? The answer to both is yes. ''Night Without Day'' was a French best seller. To wit, the lovers are as beautiful and fashion-conscious as they are anguished - a hip Tristram and Isolde. Blanche is 25, and the pulsing center of life itself, ''a girl to take pride in cold water, the redness of red fruit, the desire in a man's eye.'' She is also a chanteuse cum kinky violinist. Lucas is a man who, ''swathed in white jeans . . . suggested the walking wounded.'' He divides his time between brooding over the vision of his parents drowning when he was 8 and trying to get his dissertation together at 38. Ms. Billetdoux's prose style, at least as translated here, is an unfortunate marriage of the tone of Blanche's violin playing and that of Lucas's dissertation - clotted and hyperbolic, lurching from apocalypse to ennui and back again. And even with a 36-hour marathon of lovemaking, the novel is hardly erotic, probably because of lines like ''To see and hear each stroke modify further the tenor of her grimaces and the resonance of her voice . . . made it so urgently necessary to resist a general upheaval that he was nearly unseated when she suddenly cried, 'You know everything!

What was extraordinary was not the actual design for this building, which was a wretched piece of architecture, but the circumstances surrounding its demise. For in the early months of 1987, it seemed a foregone conclusion that this immense, double-towered structure would rise over Columbus Circle: the complex deal by which the city sold the land under the Coliseum to the development firm of Boston Properties for $455 million had been approved by the Board of Estimate with only token opposition. But as the year went on, there was a growing sense around New York that this project was too big by half as well as a wholly innappropriate piece of architecture, and the cries against it began to mount. They grew louder and louder, and reached a climax earlier this month with the surprise victory of the Municipal Art Society in its lawsuit against the City of New York to block the project.",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE LEOPARD, by Giuseppe di Lampedusa. Translated by Archibald Colquhoun. (Pantheon, $7.95.) Set in the late 19th century, when the kingdom of Sicily was losing its independence to Italy, Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel describes how an enlightened monarch adjusts to a situation he is powerless to change. '' 'The Leopard' is written by a highly civilized man whose intelligence illuminates the pages,'' our reviewer, Marc Slonim, said in 1960. IN SEARCH OF L. L. BEAN, by M. R. Montgomery. Drawings by Mary F. Rhinelander. (Mentor/New American Library, $4.50.) This history of the renowned mail-order sporting goods king, Leon Leonwood Bean, begins, appropriately enough, with an epigraph from Thoreau about the practical and spiritual value of a good pair of boots. In 1984, The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said the book is ''an edifying tale of America's development as a consuming society.'' Among its observations: the company's most successful advertisements have run not in such publications as Outdoor Life or Field & Stream but in The New York Review of Books. STRAIGHT CUT, by Madison Smartt Bell. (Penguin, $3.95.) In writing this ''odd, old-fashionedly hard-boiled novel'' about a degenerate sometime film editor caught up in an international drug deal, Madison Smartt Bell has ''piled up a debt to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett that will take him a long time to repay,'' Elliott Sirkin said here last year. But the author's depiction of ''the ordinary horrors of life for a wandering philosopher-esthete'' make the novel worth reading. THE STRAW GIANT. America's Armed Forces: Triumphs and Failures, by Arthur T. Hadley. (Avon, $10.95.) Since World War II, Arthur T. Hadley has observed the military - both as an Army captain and with the detached eye of a journalist. ''Few writers have as profound a knowledge of the armed services, their virtues and faults,'' Drew Middleton said in The Book Review in 1986. ''At a critical moment in the history of the American military he has written a clear, incisive account of its strengths and many weaknesses.'' THE BRANDONS, by Angela Thirkell. (Carroll & Graf, $4.95.) Angela Thirkell, the author of ''Pomfret Towers,'' has gained a following among those who are amused by her satires of English country-house life. When this story of the conflicts between a widow and her husband's aunt was published in 1939, Louise Maunsell Field said here that it gets off to a rather slow start but is ''a refreshing, entertaining and very restful novel stemming directly from the Jane Austen-Anthony Trollope branch of English fiction.'' WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER: The Voices of Cambodia's Revolution and Its People, by Elizabeth Becker. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) It has been estimated that a million people, or about 15 percent of the population, died in Cambodia's ''killing fields'' during the Khmer Rouge terror of the late 1970's. Elizabeth Becker, a former Washington Post correspondent, tells the story by ''blending narrative with analysis . . . solid research and a broad historical perspective'' to produce a book that is as thoughtful as it is deeply felt,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. THE MALDIVE MYSTERY, by Thor Heyerdahl. (Ballantine, $4.95.) On a 1982 trip to the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean, the explorer Thor Heyerdahl found that the early settlers of this Moslem nation worshiped not Allah but the sun. His story of the archeological expedition ''is a fascinating combination of historical reconstruction and intelligent speculation,'' our reviewer, Jon Foreman, said last year. THE PEACOCK FEATHER MURDERS, by Carter Dickson. (International Polygonics, $4.95.) Despite the title's suggestion, no one is actually tickled to death in this mystery, Isaac Anderson said in The Book Review in 1937, but the story (in which police are invited to a murder and the killer seems to vanish before their eyes) is ''an absolute topnotcher.'' The same publisher has also reprinted NINE - AND DEATH MAKES TEN ($4.95) by Carter Dickson (a pseudonym used by John Dickson Carr, who died in 1977), which takes place in the confined, floating universe of a seagoing munitions carrier. Although there are only nine people aboard, the identity of the murderer is a mystery to the end, Kay Irvin said here in 1940. FROM HEAVEN LAKE: Travels Through Sinkiang and Tibet, by Vikram Seth. (Vintage, $5.95.) Before he became known for ''The Golden Gate,'' his novel-in-verse about lapsed yuppies in San Francisco, Vikram Seth hitchhiked across China and recorded his impressions. ''This is the perfect travel book,'' one reviewer said in 1983. Mr. Seth ''is a wonderful companion.'' IRON & SILK, by Mark Salzman. (Vintage, $5.95.) Another young author, Mark Salzman, learned about China by spending two years teaching English to doctors in the province of Hunan; at the same time, he studied calligraphy and martial arts. Mr. Salzman's anecdotes ''kept a smile on my face from cover to cover,'' Richard Selzer said earlier this year. ''If there were a prize for most winning writer, [ he ] would cop it.'' THE WOMEN'S DECAMERON, by Julia Voznesenskaya. Translated by W. B. Linton. (Owl/Holt, $9.95.) Ten women confined in a maternity ward in Leningrad have little in common except their violent, sordid pasts. The stories they tell one another of rape and revenge result in a ''profoundly interesting'' novel, Fay Weldon said here last year. ''Julia Voznesenskaya's vision shines through the opaqueness of cruelty, indecency, pornography, and . . . into the sheer delight and wonder of just being alive, and female, and fighting back.''",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"MOUNT'S MISTAKE. By Lew McCreary. (Atlantic Monthly, Paper, $7.95.) Jay Fielding Mount, the hapless protagonist of Lew McCreary's exuberant first novel, is an ''accidental'' man, carried along on the swift currents of change that are pulsing through America in the last years of the 19th century. Part of that current is quite literally electric as the country becomes fascinated both by the power of electricity and by the character of the man most closely associated with it, Thomas Edison. Jay, struck and almost killed by lightning in his youth, becomes involved in increasingly ironic incidents with Edison. In the last of these, he inspires a plan to electrocute an elephant while Edison's fledgling film company covers the event. Jay's peregrinations begin when he becomes a pariah in his hometown of Bolusburgh, Ohio, after the death of a child left in his charge. At first, he falls in with a wonderfully sardonic group of itinerant entertainers. Later he experiences the humiliations of jail and, after his release, takes a job stoking a boiler in one of Edison's plants. Eventually he becomes a roustabout in a seedy but resourceful circus. The characters who collide with Jay in his erratic travels are all vividly illuminated in prose that catches the haunting specifics of a moment. But finally Jay is too fragile a figure to sustain much speculation on the modern age, and ''Mount's Mistake'' comes to seem more a collection of wonderful images than a tightly woven tale. Nevertheless, it announces the arrival of an extraordinary writer who requires only a more pointed story to showcase his considerable talents. By RICHARD E. NICHOLLS",1987-12-27T05:00:00+0000

(Alternate opening: After long months of campaigning for President, I'm starting over with the new year, because I've learned the hard way that neither I nor the other 12 candidates have offered you the kind of hope and vision you're looking for.) The first and most important part of my new platform is that I aim to put Americans to work at useful jobs. Official unemployment stands at just below 6 percent of the work force today, but that doesn't include those who've never had jobs and those who've lost jobs and have been discouraged from looking for another. It doesn't tell you how many millions of Americans who lost high-paying industrial jobs owing to plant failures and cutbacks have found new jobs only in the service sector - paying half or less of what they used to make.

For example, he said, if someone ate a heavy meal and then ''started doing something else that demands blood flow, there would be relative ischemia,'' or a reduction of blood supply to the intestines; this would produce a cramp. Muscular problems could also cause such pain, he said. Q. Why do some mammals mate for life? A. Few mammals do so, according to Marie Lawrence, senior scientific assistant in the mammalogy department of the American Museum of Natural History.

Patriots 24, Dolphins 10: Steve Grogan threw for 238 yards and two touchdowns as the visiting New England Patriots, eliminated from the playoffs a day earlier, beat Miami in the final game of the 1987 regular season. Grogan, playing with a broken bone in his left hand, connected with Irving Fryar for a 3-yard score after a Miami fumble and hit Stephen Starring with a 34-yard pass to cap a 79-yard drive. Grogan completed 21 of 32 passes. Both New England and Miami finished with 8-7 records. (AP) N.H.L. Capitals 4, Maple Leafs 4: The veteran defenseman Rod Langway, playing in his second game after suffering a back injury, fired a wrist shot from the point in the third period last night to give Washington the tie in Toronto. Langway, who missed 14 games with a ruptured disk, got the puck at the blue line just as an interference penalty to Ed Olczyk ended and put a wrist shot past the screened goaltender, Allan Bester, at 5 minutes 31 seconds of the third period. Michal Pivonka, Scott Stevens and Mike Gartner also scored for the Capitals, who came back from second-period deficits of 3-1 and 4-2.

If banks around the world accept the proposal, Mexico's foreign bank debt, which now stands at more than $70 billion, could be reduced by as much as $10 billion. [ Page A1. ] THE ECONOMY The American economy is undergoing a change with far-reaching implications. It is becoming more dependent on exports and less on domestic consumption. This shift, in the long run, may resolve the trade deficit problem. In the short run, it appears to be the key to avoiding a recession.

us,Results Plus; N.B.A.,"Rockets 101, Pistons 91: Joe Barry Carroll scored 25 points as the visiting Rockets outscored the Pistons, 15-7, in the final 5 minutes 41 seconds last night to break the Pistons' 10-game winning streak. The loss prevented the Pistons from setting a franchise record for consecutive victories. They had tied the mark set Feb. 12-28, 1986. This latest winning streak was the longest in the league this season. Carroll and Akeem Olajuwon each had 10 points in the third quarter when Houston outscored Detroit, 30-10, to erase a 57-46 halftime lead. Carroll, who was traded earlier in the season with Sleepy Floyd to Houston from Golden State for Ralph Sampson and Steve Harris, tied his season high in scoring. (AP) N.H.L. Nordiques 5, Sabres 1: Peter Stastny scored his 300th career goal and Ron Tugnutt, the Quebec goaltender, won his league debut to lead the Nordiques at home. The victory was the third straight for the Nordiques, who moved into third place in the Adams Division, a point ahead of Buffalo. Tugnutt, who was credited with an assist on Stastny's goal, was promoted a week ago from the Fredericton Express of the American Hockey League, where he had a 13-2-2 record and a 2.79 goals-against average. Besides making some key saves earlier in the game with the Nordiques shorthanded, Tugnutt also stopped Christian Ruuttu on a breakaway in the third period. He made 29 saves over all. Anton Stastny, Jeff Jackson, Alan Haworth and Mike Eagles also scored for Quebec. (AP) Bruins 4, Penguins 4: Chris Dahlquist scored with 3:27 left in the third period last night and Gilles Meloche made 40 saves for the Penguins. Dahlquist fired a 50-foot shot from the left point past Rejean Lemelin, the Boston goaltender, for his second goal of the season. Cam Neely scored his 18th goal at 8:56 of the third period to give the visiting Bruins a 4-3 lead. Boston tied the game, 3-3, in the third period when Rick Middleton scored on a breakaway. (AP) Horse Racing Anniron Wins Ticonderoga: Anniron scored her 13th triumph in 17 career starts when she posted a 3 1/2-length victory yesterday in the Ticonderoga Handicap for New York-bred fillies and mares at Aqueduct. Chase the Dream, who led to the stretch, held to be easily second best in the field of six. Anniron, who carried highweight of 121 pounds under Robbie Davis, went a mile and an eighth on the fast track in 1:52 4/5 to earn $40,560, the winner's share of the gross purse of $67,600 for her owner, William A. Martusewicz. She returned $2.60 for $2 to win. Tennis Paradis Upsets Sukova: Pascal Paradis of France scored a 6-4, 6-3 upset over second-seeded Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia yesterday in the second round of the $150,000 Ariadne Classic in Brisbane, Australia. Paradis, ranked 105th in the world, trailed by 0-4 in the first set before beating Sukova in straight sets to advance to a third-round meeting with Masako Yanagi of Japan. Pam Shriver of the United States, seeded first, started slowly in her second-round match against Julie Richardson of New Zealand before winning, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0. Another American, 12th-seeded Betsy Nagelsen, was the only other seeded player to lose, falling to Claudia Porwick of West Germany, 7-6, 7-6. Wendy Turnbull of Australia, seeded sixth, struggled before beating Tina Mochizuki of the United States, 1-6, 6-1, 6-2. (AP) Pozzi Defeats Anger: Gianluca Pozzi of Italy scored a 6-4, 6-3 first-round victory over Matt Anger, seeded eighth, yesterday in the $93,400 South Australian Open in Adelaide. Anger became the fifth seeded player to lose in the first round of the 32-player Grand Prix event. Other winners yesterday included Johan Anderson, a 16-year-old Swedish-born Australian, Barry Moir of South Africa and Joey Rive of the United States. Anderson surprised Alexander Mronz of West Germany, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, and Moir beat Tom Nijssen of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-3. Rive defeated Eddie Edwards of South Africa, who won this event two years ago, 6-1, 7-6.

The drop in the index has not been exceeded in more than six years, but most analysts remained confident that the economy would continue to expand, though probably at a slower pace than in the last several months. [ Page D1. ] Sales of new homes edged down 1.2 percent in November as a huge jump in demand in the Northeast was not enough to offset weakness in the rest of the country. The decline in sales was accompanied by a big jump in prices, with the median price of a new home soaring by 12.3 percent, to $119,000. [ D1. ] INTERNATIONAL Latin America hailed the proposal to help Mexico reduce its debt. Other debt-burdened nations like Argentina and Brazil hope they can take advantage of a similar plan. [ D3. ] Morgan Guaranty Trust, the primary architect of the proposal, began sending details of the plan to other banks that have made loans to Mexico. Regional banks in the U.S. followed in the footsteps of the nation's biggest banks by praising the proposal. [ D3. ] COMPANIES Western Union will complete its long-sought restructuring. The company said its bondholders had agreed to a debt exchange, the last hurdle in its race to complete its restructuring plan by the end of the year. [ D1. ] Rupert Murdoch will be unable to continue his ownership of The New York Post and The Boston Herald while owning television stations in those cities because of a little-noticed addition to a catchall Federal spending measure. [ A1. ] A judge rejected an application by Gannett and Knight-Ridder to merge the business operations of The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, which they own respectively. [ A13. ] Makers of three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles agreed to stop selling them, the Justice Department announced. The vehicles have been linked to 900 deaths in five years. [ A10. ] The Higbee Company is being acquired by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and Dillard Department Stores. [ D3. ] Dyncorp has accepted a new offer by its chairman to purchase the military contractor for cash and securities he valued at $23.25 a share, or $246 million. [ D3. ] MARKETS Trading in stock-index futures should be curbed, because it has contributed to excessive speculation in the market, a report financed by the New York Stock Exchange concludes. Among other changes, the report recommended an increase in the amount of cash required to be put up to trade the index futures. [ D1. ] The stock market bounced back with a broad advance on sharply higher volume. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.21 points, to 1,950.10, ending a three-session slide. One of the principal reasons for the rise, analysts said, was the abnormally large premium of stock-index futures over actual averages. [ D4. ] Short-term interest rates fell sharply, as fears of a temporary but sharp upward spike in borrowing costs over the New Year's weekend evaporated. [ D10. ] The dollar was mixed in quiet trading as gold prices fell. In New York, gold dropped $3.05, to $483.40 an ounce. [ D11. ] Livestock and meat futures prices advanced strongly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. [ D11. ] Yields were mixed for C.D.'s, money market mutual funds and bank money market accounts. [ D13. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The bankruptcy case of A. H. Robins provides twists on the cliche that timing is everything. Bidding companies face deadlines for legal findings, while Robins is under pressure from shareholders to choose quickly. Talking Deals. [ D2. ] Analysts agree on solid growth for railroads in 1988.

us,Woody Allen Flirts With Chekhov,"Long before he reaches those sobering final words in the end credits - ''Filmed entirely at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York'' - Woody Allen abandons any pretense that his new film, ''September,'' is anything other than a one-set play performed before the camera. The play is Chekhovian. We know this because the characters drink only vodka - until the final fade-out, at which point the more mournful women in the household switch to tea. Although the setting is nominally present-day Vermont and the intellectual characters yearn for Paris instead of Moscow, we might as well be in the provincial Russia of long ago. The dowdy antique furnishings of the family estate show few signs of the contemporary (no recent brand-name products, only black dial telephones), and that estate, along with any surrounding orchards, is up for sale to crass moneyed strangers. If there isn't a symbolic sea gull in ''September,'' we do hear about a neighboring town called East Hope. As the author of ''Without Feathers'' knows well, hope, like a sea gull, is the thing with feathers.",1987-12-31T05:00:00+0000
