The movie's ghostly butler starts out with the name of Charles Grady, but he somehow becomes Delbert Grady before the story is finished. The caption on a closing photograph of Jack Nicholson utterly defies explanation. And the director, Stanley Kubrick, once again leaves his audiences asking a familiar question: How can anyone make a film so fastidiously beautiful and still leave so many loose ends?

Suddenly, two bank robbers burst in, and they scare a little boy, one of many innocent customers in the place. The little boy drops his piggy bank and it shatters. This is too much for Bronco Billy. He give the bandits The Look, an indignant squint that means, roughly translated, ''Grrr,'' and then he hauls off and fires away. ",1980-06-11T05:00:00+0000

This essentially modest movie is reported to have cost about $30 million, and what did all that money buy? Scores of car crashes. Too many extras. Overstaged dance numbers. And a hollowness that certainly didn't come cheap. A film that moved faster and called less attention to its indulgences might never convey, as ""The Blues Brothers"" does in all but its jolliest moments, such unqualified despair.",1980-06-20T05:00:00+0000

Of the German directors now receiving so much acclaim, Mr. Schlondorff is the least diosyncratic, which may be why he so willingly and often so successfully adapts other people's works, including Heinrich Boll's ""The Lost Honor of Kathrina Blum.""

Bruce Jenner plays an uptight lawyer, and the comic high point of the film occurs when he spills dinner and has to take off his pants. Valerie Perrine plays a woman. In the boy-meet-boy world of the movie, this is something of a novelty, but it doesn't make for much of a role. The intervals between musical numbers are mostly dead air.",1980-06-20T05:00:00+0000

In fact, ''Rockers'' is in many respects the better of the two. ''The Harder They Come'' had the invaluable advantage of coming first, and the area both films cover is almost narrow enough to make a second seem superfluous. But ''Rockers'' holds its ground, thanks to its funny, offbeat players and sinuous reggae score. ",1980-06-27T05:00:00+0000
