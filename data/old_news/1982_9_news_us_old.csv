us,WHAT TO DO THIS MONTH,"Plant and Transplant Plants wind down top growth at this time of year and concentrate energy on establishing roots, which makes September ideal for digging and dividing spring-blooming perennials. New perennials, especially peonies and poppies, must be planted this month. Fall is also the best season to move trees and shrubs, both evergreen and deciduous. Before any plants are transplanted, the soil must be prepared well. Incorporate a three- to four-inch layer of peat moss or better, well-rotted compost, into each planting hole or flower bed. Plant spring-flowering hardy bulbs, particularly the little bulbs that bloom early: crocus, snowdrop, glory of the snow, squills, winter aconite, puschkinia and windflower. These are best tucked near the house where the early flowers can seen. Lawn Care This is the month to complete lawn care. Cool growing weather is ideal for grass plants to establish roots, whether sod or seed. If the lawn is thriving now, it may not need to be fertilized until later in the year, after leaves fall and before cold weather. If the lawn is skimpy, apply fertilizer now. Follow application rates given on the bag, and distribute only with a mechanical spreader to prevent overdoses and burning. If the lawn has not been limed in recent years, it may need it. A pH reading somewhere between 6 and 7 is ideal for lawns; otherwise, soil nutrients are not soluble. To be sure, make an accurate soil test with home kits available at most garden centers.",1982-09-02T05:00:00+0000

In 1970, President Nixon saw another recession rob the Republican Party of expected gains, but law and order and the Vietnam War were also compelling concerns. In 1974, Republicans were badly damaged by two issues: inflation and the Watergate affair, which kept ashamed Republican voters home.

Each is to be seen on one of those small, stark stages currently proving so popular with producers of the classics, and each is performed in what seems to be a returning fashion, in a relatively straightforward manner, without an obvious overlay of contemporary or experimental ideas. Edward Fox's version, of which more later, was awaited with a certain incredulity, but Anton Lesser's with genuine excitement, though more because of the name and nature of his director than his own proven talents.

I'm not accustomed to seeing the old warhorse, of which one can become foolishly fond, played in a setting that might do well enough for a stock company mounting of something by Philip Barry. I'm used to a ''Ghosts'' that's a bit more overstuffed: a lot of horsehair and heavy oak doors that rumble ponderously shut and big fat gaslamps perched next to handsomely tooled books, all that. Not that Ibsen's play is supposed to look eerie, as though poltergeists would begin banging away on the attic floor any minute. The ghosts in the play aren't, of course, ectoplasmic figures at all; they are echoes of the past, genetic hand-me-downs that tend to determine our present destinies (''We're all ghosts,'' ruminates Liv Ullmann as Mrs. Alving, ''Our mothers and fathers live on inside us'').

Among the prominent casualties were two Buffalo Bills, Mike Kadish, a nose tackle, and Lemar Parrish, a defensive back. Kadish, a 10-year veteran and the backup to all-pro Fred Smerlas, was the second player representative cut recently. Earlier, the New Orleans Saints released Benny Ricardo, their place-kicker, a move that angered Ed Garvey, executive director of the players association. Garvey suggested that teams were penalizing representatives. But Coach Chuck Knox said that cutting Kadish was ''based on going with a younger player.'' Parrish, a 13-year player, came to Buffalo from the Washington Redskins in the offseason. ... Surprising cuts were made by the Philadelphia Eagles, who placed Wally Henry and Rodney Parker, wide receivers, on waivers. And Rich Caster, a veteran receiver and a former Jet, was waived by Washington. ... The Raiders made another notable cut when they dropped Mark van Eeghen, the leading rusher in the history of the franchise, which moved this year from Oakland to Los Angeles.

The kitchen may have all of the components for its former success but the present staff has not discovered as yet the key to producing the completed article - the beguiling way wih fresh herbs, the daring touches of hot pepper, the wisps of puff pastry. Not all the dishes produced by the old kitchen were excellent, but enough were so that on balance Covington rated an easy two stars. Now an averaging of dishes (from inedible to competent) results in a rating of one star and a sinking one at that.",1982-09-12T05:00:00+0000

us,THE STATE OF THE CITY'S SCHOOLS,"THE New York City public school system, viewed not long ago as a hopelessly lost cause, has lately been showing some cause for hope. With a surprising upturn in a variety of indicators, officials are optimistic about the school year that begins tomorrow. An important factor is rising achievement scores in reading and mathematics in the elementary and junior high schools. In the spring, these scores surpassed the national norms for the first time in at least a decade, putting New York City ahead of most other major urban systems. Authorities credit the gains to the tough promotional policy Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola put in place two years ago, a reflection of his desire to set higher standards and hold students to them. Now that they must earn their way to the next level, almost 50 percent more fourth graders and 100 percent more seventh graders were held back last year than in 1978. Progress at these levels, it is hoped, will eventually supply the high schools with better prepared students. In the meantime, however, the system continues to suffer from having too many high school students with neither the ability nor the educational background needed for a diploma. The schools also continue to suffer from crime. Though many categories have declined recently, spending time in some of the system's 1,000 school buildings is still only slightly safer than a stroll through Central Park after midnight. Like the city, the ethnic composition of the student body is gradually changing, with minority groups now accounting for 74.1 percent of an enrollment of 904,000.",1982-09-12T05:00:00+0000

us,'Monsignor Quixote',"In recent years Graham Greene has been availing himself of the special prerogative of an old master. With many triumphs behind him, he can now turn his hand to whatever catches his fancy without feeling obliged to make a major statement or to advance his career in some striking way. The results of this freedom have ranged considerably in subject matter, tone and intensity. If none has been first-rate Greene, all have been interesting as latter-day reflections of the master's long-standing preoccupation with doom, pity and the inscrutability of God's will. In ''The Human Factor'' (1978) Greene once again stacked the deck against his protagonistvictim, a mediocre but kindly man trapped in a barbed-wire tangle of spying and betrayal. This novel was followed by ''Dr. Fischer of Geneva, or The Bomb Party'' (1980), a chilling, even repellent story of a rich man who sadistically plays God with the poor toadies who strive to please him, tormenting and humiliating them for the sport of it. And now - again shifting course - Greene presents us with ''Monsignor Quixote,'' the gentlest and most amiable of his books since ''Travels with My Aunt.''",1982-09-19T05:00:00+0000

Can you advise us how to find such a place that is modestly priced? - S.G., New York, N.Y. Answer:Going beyond the relatively easy-to-reach winter sun destinations strains mightily a family's finances - as well as its patience and endurance - when the family includes babies or small children. Look for nonstop or one-connection daytime flights of a few hours' total length during which the children may fall asleep. This should be easier to handle than spending two days changing planes and laying over to reach an exotic destination. Either coast of South Florida or the Keys are reachable from New York by nonstop or one-connection flights, and fares on the New York-Miami route, in particular, are highly competitive.

The Arab League attempted to play what should now be the discredited P.L.O. card. Yasir Arafat is a defeated leader of a now dispersed terrorist force, and the effort to puff up his importance flies in the face of the Arab states' own demonstrated lack of enthusiasm to take in P.L.O. fighters evacuated from Beirut.",1982-09-19T05:00:00+0000

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - It is perhaps somewhat unseemly to raise the issue of Egypt's predicament, in the aftermath of Beirut, at a time when hundreds of Palestinian bodies are lying in a mass grave. Still, Egyptians must ask: why? How could the Begin administration allow such a thing to happen? These are not novel questions. The anguished American Jewish community - and indeed the whole world - are asking them today. But with this difference: We have signed a peace treaty with Israel. Inevitably, therefore, when we ask it, somewhere in the background an egotistical worry lurks: ''Why did they do this to us?''","The recall of our ambassador from Tel Aviv is but one way of framing the question. For if Anwar el-Sadat's initiative was of crucial importance in opening up an avenue to peace, the way for President Hosni Mubarak to salvage the Camp David accords is not through a policy of appeasement - like Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's in 1938.",1982-09-25T05:00:00+0000

On cue, teams of four raise and lower 260-pound aluminum ladders, while pairs haul 85-pound bundles of hose. They each take turns climbing a ladder with a 35-pound box fan, an oxygen tank or a chain saw strapped to their backs. Department instructors tease overly cautious trainees, telling them to count their buttons when they're done, since the buttons can pop off if recruits cling to the ladder rungs. Worse than caution is laziness. If any of those recruits performs poorly, all 33 will have to climb that tower.",1982-09-26T05:00:00+0000

The house that Betsy and Olavo Monteiro de Carvalho built on top of one of the highest hills in the middle of Rio de Janeiro had to be eye-catching or guests might have spent all their time looking out the windows. On one side, the city stretches out to Guanabara Bay and Sugar Loaf Mountain. The other side is presided over by the faithinspiring presence of the Christ the Redeemer statue on the peak of Corcovado Mountain. Theirs is one of four spacious houses that members of the Monteiro family have built in a compound whose 30 acres still leave room for new generations to plant their ideas in the choice location. Betsy and Olavo Monteiro's idea was to come up with a place that could serve as home for them and their three small daughters, and a reception spot for the many social evenings Mr. Monteiro's professional life requires. He is the head of the family-run holding company, Monteiro Aranha S.A., that, as one of Brazil's most innovative and successful, brings people such as Arab sheiks, German automobile makers and American bankers to Rio on business.
