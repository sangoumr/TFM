By an unofficial 127-to-19 vote, the Assembly, which is led by Democrats, voted to raise the state's current $5.15-an-hour wage, the same as the federal minimum, to $6 an hour on Oct. 1; $6.75 an hour on July 1, 2005; and $7.10 an hour on Jan. 1, 2006. The minimum wage has not been increased in New York since March 2000. Twelve states, including many in the Northeast, have a minimum wage above the federal standard. The State Senate, which is led by Republicans, was reluctant to act, arguing that raising the wage would put New York at a disadvantage with other states' wages. But if the federal government does not act soon to raise the minimum wage nationally, ''then we will reassess things,'' said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who supports an increase. Al Baker (NYT)",2004-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Bank checks and other items pass through the New Jersey International and Bulk Mail Center in Jersey City, where the employee, Eloise Smith, sorted them into mail bags. Authorities accused Ms. Smith, 48, of Jersey City, of selling the checks to an identity-theft ring led by Joe Nathan Levine for $20 a box. Impersonators, using identification that matched the checks, would then use them to buy goods at stores, the United States attorney's office said. Prosecutors said that about $134,000 was taken from the accounts of bank customers, mainly from Bergen County, from February to December 2000. Mr. Levine, 41, also of Jersey City, pleaded guilty in October to buying the stolen checks. He is to be sentenced on Monday. Stacy Albin (NYT)",2004-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Mott, said the company, which is based in Gaithersburg, Md., will keep selling FluMist with or without its partner, Wyeth. Sales of FluMist fell short of MedImmune's goals even after supplies of traditional flu shots ran out in the United States, partly because the spray is about nine times as expensive. FluMist revenue will be no more than $55 million this year, and first-quarter profit will fall short of analysts' estimates, the company said.",2004-03-02T05:00:00+0000

The new measure passed by a vote of 60 to 1 in the Senate and by an unofficial vote of 143 to 3 in the Assembly, officials said. Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to sign it into law, said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman. The bill would keep many aspects of the old law intact but add new restrictions. It would make the area around ground zero in Lower Manhattan off limits to vendors and would add a block of 42nd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, to the list of restricted areas.

The album, by Brian Burton, a Los Angeles D.J. who records as Danger Mouse, combines raps from Jay-Z's ''Black Album'' with re-mixed music from the Beatles' classic White Album. The protest's organizer, Nicholas Reville, a co-founder of the music industry watchdog group Downhill Battle, said the ''The Grey Album'' was downloaded more frequently than the best-selling album in America, Norah Jones's ''Feels Like Home,'' was purchased. At least 360,000 tracks from ''The Grey Album'' -- or 30,000 albums' worth (the album has 12 tracks) -- were downloaded from just 54 of the more than 150 Web sites taking part in the protest. Those 54 responded to an inquiry by The New York Times with data transfer documentation. Jeanne Meyer, an EMI spokeswoman, called the numbers ''irrelevant to the fact that we are asking those who have illegally made an unauthorized work available to stop doing it.'' Ms. Meyer declined to comment on whether EMI would pursue legal action against the Web sites. BILL WERDE",2004-03-02T05:00:00+0000

It was finally colonized in the mid 1700's, making it the oldest port on the West Coast. In 1769, the Mission San Diego de Alcal was the first of the 21 missions built by Spanish friars throughout the state. In modern times, the city has become closely associated with its naval station and home to such famous attractions as the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld. It also has a cultural centerpiece in Balboa Park, one of the country's best urban parks. The city, however, may be most famous for its glorious sunsets over the Pacific.

The inhabitants have come to remember that it is a city with its beauties (the cherry blossoms, in spring, around the reflecting pool; or the late sunlight upon the marble monuments) and its privileges (almost all the museums are free; the spectacle of politics is always near at hand), with amusements all its own. (Even the taxicabs are entertaining in their way: the supremely illogical zone system, which, instead of using meters, divides the city into payment sectors designed to make the politicians' commute cheap; the disconcerting oddity of multiple customers with multiple destinations, crammed into a single cab; and the eccentricity of the drivers, whose knowledge of the city may be tenuous at best, but whose interest in global politics is often passionate and voluble.)",2004-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Motel of the Mysteries,"Scattered clues situate Judson Mitcham's slender second novel in the mid-1990's, but SABBATH CREEK (University of Georgia, $22.95) is a transcendent coming-of-age story that feels unshackled to any particular time. Its sense of place, however, is pungently particular, infused with the surface languor and latent violence of the Deep South. Prompted by a black eye from her alcoholic husband, Charlene Pope embarks with her son, Lewis, on a road trip through southern Georgia, until their broken-down car forces them to establish temporary residence in the tiny town of Sabbath Creek. There, they become the sole guests in a motel run by a startlingly spry 93-year-old black man named Truman Stroud, whose scowls and gripes poorly disguise a playful prankishness. Thirteen-year-old Lewis, our sensitive narrator, spends his days ruminating, practicing his pitching technique and listening to Stroud's dubious yarns, as well as the old man's more reliable reminiscences of Jim Crow laws and Negro League baseball heroes. This spare, lovely novel, while generous in humor, is anchored by sorrow and interspersed with portents of tragedy. Especially poignant are Lewis's flashbacks to the tense dread of living at the whims of an alcoholic father. ''When he was like that,'' Lewis recalls, ''I didn't know how to stand, how to hold my face.'' Lewis observes everything with the alertness of someone who does not yet take common experiences, such as kissing and drunkenness, for granted; he never resorts to shorthand to convey them, but describes them with a scrupulous fidelity to his own perceptions.

Stephen Wright's undersung ''M31: A Family Romance'' is that sort of book. ''Unsung'' wouldn't be the right word, since the novel was well reviewed when it came out in 1988, but Wright has never quite had the readership he deserves. Perhaps he wavers too much between the standard categories. There may be enough violence, drugs and chaos to put off readers likely to appreciate the beauty and daring of his style, and yet his fiction isn't callow enough to attract the following of a bad-boy cult writer. Also, he's not easy. Starting one of his books feels a little like being jumped the moment you walk into a room: it's disorienting and challenging, with more going on than you can possibly grasp at first.",2004-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Vollmann has often been an off-putting writer, sometimes intentionally so. There is the seamy (and admittedly autobiographical) subject matter -- living with prostitutes, using drugs -- of too many early works, and also of his novel ''The Royal Family'' (2000). There is the remote North American history of the four published novels in his ''Seven Dreams'' series. And, of course, there is his vaunting ambition: since 1987 Vollmann has released 14 books, 20 if one counts as separate works the seven volumes of ''Rising Up and Rising Down'' (2003), his valiant attempt to comprehend worldwide violence.

Today, West, who was born in South London in 1892 and died in 1983, is a relative unknown, especially compared to a contemporary like Virginia Woolf. Part of the reason might be that the diversity of her writings has made her legacy difficult to categorize. She was a critic, novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, biographer, political reporter and a magnificent letter writer. Her greatest work, ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,'' is an epic mix of personal history, travel writing and political journalism about Yugoslavia; the book drew new attention in the early 1990's during the Yugoslav wars.",2004-03-07T05:00:00+0000

But he also dares to bypass all clerical authority in conveying his thoughts on the divine. Instead of being an act of worship, voiced by people together speaking of God in hallowed surroundings, the Mass becomes a text to be considered, even pummeled, for its truth by one person so that others may consider it for themselves.

us,All in Good Time," There's a photograph of me with the family dog, maud, a wire haired terrier who seems to be laughing, Maud sits to my right on the brick stairs leading up to our front door. The house on La Brea Terrace has been rented for a year. It's a snug little place with a front lawn and no backyard, atop La Brea, just a bit into the Hollywood Hills. It is December 7, 1941. In short pants, suspenders, a white short-sleeve shirt, and black high shoes, I look bathed and scrubbed for the Sunday to be. It is morning, perhaps ten. My father, ever the photographer, is taking his time. ""No, hold it right there. Hold it. Now. One more."" My face does not reflect irritation. That would come years later. In fact, I appear to be happy, smiling in the sunshine, with Maud, the ""smartest dog who ever lived""-my mother's view of Maud, always-right there next to me. The smartest dog, the smartest boy-me. The best movie, the most delicious piece of pie, the most succulent pear, the most wonderful, the most beautiful, the most thrilling, the greatest. Katherine Carrington Schwartz, a natural hyperbolist, was also inclined to the malaprop. ""My, how time passes so fly."" And always that strong clear speaking voice, with a song inside. Katherine had been an ingenue on the Broadway stage. Arthur Schwartz had spotted her in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Music in the Air singing ""I've Told Every Little Star"" to a young Walter Slezak. My father had attended the opening on election night 1932, a secondary event to FDR's first plurality but not secondary to the composer of ""Dancing in the Dark."" He sought out the ingenue almost before the curtain went down. I've occasionally imagined him, oh so eager, leaping upon the stage midway through the second act. ""Good evening, I'm Arthur Schwartz,"" he might have said. Katherine, still in character, might have attempted to incorporate him. ""Well, hello,"" she might have replied. ""We've all been waiting for you."" She might have extended her arm to the rest of the bewildered cast. The orchestra, trying to cover the disruption, would almost certainly have struck up ""The Song Is You,"" a ballad in the score, while Arthur was hustled away by stagehands, his friends and peers Kern and Hammerstein in the back of the theater, burying their faces in their hands.

The notion that an unstintingly violent, purposefully controversial film -- to say nothing of one without a word of English in the script or a major star in the cast -- could become a blockbuster almost defies belief. But ''The Passion,'' helped by the synergy between Mel Gibson's shrewd media-baiting and the media's eager swallowing of the bait, will in all likelihood, by the time you read this, have surpassed ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' as the highest-grossing foreign-language film ever released in the United States.

Eighty-three percent of residents and 64 percent of small-business leaders say they would be interested in receiving emergency training, according to the survey. The poll was conducted from Feb. 23-27 and included telephone interviews with 602 New York City residents and 204 small-business leaders in the city, the Red Cross said. A majority of people in both groups cited lack of time and money as obstacles to preparing a plan, and 73 percent said they did not know how to develop a plan. The poll for residents has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, and for the business leaders it is 7 percent. The Red Cross offers preparedness classes in Manhattan for New York residents, and said it planned to hold a class for businesses.

Witnesses at the scene said they saw a man wearing a knapsack take the money from a cardboard cash box and run down 86th Street. Families who were celebrating Purim in the building at the time refused to let the incident spoil their holiday. ''Nobody was hurt, and a poor person got the money,'' said Nathan Lowe, 43, who attended the celebrations with his wife and six children. Giving money to the poor, Mr. Lowe explained, is one of the traditions of Purim, which celebrates the foiling of a plot to destroy the Jews in ancient Persia. Other traditions include dressing up and playing games, as dozens of children were doing at the synagogue yesterday afternoon. ''We fulfilled the commandment but not in the way we expected,'' said Mr. Lowe, as he clutched a pink tutu that had been worn by one of his children.

He had been quoted in newspaper articles saying that he supported the verdict in part because he did not want to see her sue the City of Meriden and profit from the death of her son, J. Daniel, who hanged himself in January 2002. Mr. Giardina denied making the comments. The judge, Stephen F. Frazzini of Superior Court, noted that the boy had been the victim of incessant bullying at school.

Dance organizations spent $121 million and employed more than 2,600 people, allocating more than $80 million to salaries during the year for full-, part-time and contract workers.

The survey estimated annual direct and indirect tax benefits to the city and state at $23.2 million. Dance schools, which draw many foreign students, were not included in the survey.

The action -- the first in South Korea -- deepened the political turmoil that has gripped the country for months. A total of 159 legislators endorsed the motion to begin a debate on impeachment, well above the majority of the 270-member National Assembly required. Mr. Roh, who took office in February 2003, has no party affiliation but has said he plans to join the liberal Uri Party, which has just 46 seats in the assembly. He set off the latest clash with his opponents last month when, in a televised news conference, he called for support of the Uri Party in elections next month. The national elections watchdog ruled that Mr. Roh's comments had violated presidential neutrality, but it said the violation was minor. Political analysts said the chances of success for an impeachment were not very high. Samuel Len (NYT)",2004-03-10T05:00:00+0000

The leadership, Board of Trustees and staff of United Jewish Communities note with deep sorrow the loss of Peggy Tishman, an extraordinary and articulate advocate for the needs of the Jewish community. In addition to sixty years of inspired leadership and dedicated service to the Jewish community, Peggy had the unique distinction of being the first woman president of a major Jewish federation. Her compassion for the plight of needy elderly and the unselfish manner with which she opened her heart and home to those around her, set a standard of leadership that was unprecedented. Peggy served as the president of the UJA-Federation of New York from 1986-1989 through the merger, which established the organization. She helped found the Jewish Association for the Aged and developed an endowments program to secure the community's future. She served as a board member of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Home and Hospital, and as President of the Jewish Community Relations Council of NY. Peggy's contributions to the Jewish community were nationally recognized. Her tireless spirit, honesty and determination serve as a model of grace under pressure, the best in voluntary leadership. Her humanitarian spirit and ability to turn ideas into action will be sorely missed. To Peggy's daughter, Pat Hall, and to the entire Tishman Family, we extend our heartfelt condolences.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   QUADROZZI, JOHN","QUADROZZI--John, born August 18, 1928, the son of a Blacksmith. Starting his life, he swung his father's hammer as he learned the trade of a steel man. Most noting his physical stature said he was the Man of Steel. His repertoire expanded to truck building and mechanics. However in 1964, John changed gears and became co-founder and President of Quadrozzi Concrete Corporation, a company now celebrating its 40th year anniversary as New York's oldest and most respected name in concrete. The company John sculpted from conception has become synonymous with quality. With his dedicated family at his side, John thrusted Quadrozzi into the major leagues with its first mammoth project, the Cross Bay Bridge -- gracefully swung across Jamaica Bay into the Rockaway's to John and his company's birthplace. John then swung Quadrozzi across the bay, as it increased its range and added multiple concrete plants throughout the boroughs. Now, as the industry - recognized pioneer and leader in high strength concrete, Quadrozzi Concrete supports the all-concrete Trump World Tower on Manhattan's 1st Avenue--standing virtuously as the tallest residential building in the world, and the AOL Time Warner building on Manhattan's Columbus Circle--the Making of a Landmark and single largest and most expensive private building project in North America's history. It is said that these two projects, requiring a consistent delivery of the highest strength concrete ever produced in the city, could not have been built if not for Quadrozzi. John's legacy continues as the company he created actively supplies Building 7 of the new World Trade Center. A philanthropist, John generously gave to all that asked--especially his hometown, the Rockaway's. He was a Rockaway Chamber of Commerce-Member of the Presidents Club and 3 times Man of the Year, Rockaway's Peninsula HospitalBoard Member, former President and Co-founder of the Association of NYC Concrete Producers and recipient of countless awards for his contribution to the industry. Loyal son of the late Costantino and surviving Catherine Quadrozzi. Beloved husband of Theresa Quadrozzi. Devoted father of their four daughters Juliana, Regina, Theresa, Catherine and their only son John, Jr. Cherished grandfather of their children Darien, Quinn, Leonor, Theresa and Isabella. John died Sunday, March 7, in the year 2004, one year after a long fight against multiple ailments. He defied medical science as he cheated death again and again. Those who said he was the Man of Steel were wrong, he was ''The Man of Concrete''--John Quadrozzi goes out a winner! Reposing at Denis S. O'Connor Funeral Home, 91-05 Beach Channel Dr, Rockaway Beach, NY. Visiting Wednesday 2pm-5pm & 7pm-10pm and Thursday 2pm-5pm & 6pm-10pm.

Food scientists reduced the drink's calorie and sugar count by using a combination of Splenda and high fructose corn syrup, the company said.

Pepsi said its new drink is aimed at health-conscious consumers who drink both regular and diet colas, but sometimes shun diet soft drinks because of their taste.

Hanson recently opened the James Hotel, with sleek rooms, plasma television screens, an upscale restaurant and a fashionable bar. The two-year-old Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain has a window-wrapped restaurant and a luxurious spa with Zen overtones. The acclaimed Boulders Resort has added a Golden Door Spa, a sibling to the original in Escondido, Calif., and the venerated Marriott's Camelback Inn recently completed an $8 million renovation of its spa. The new Willow Stream spa at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess offers a cascading waterfall, meditation gardens and a eucalyptus steam room. Once a small farming community, Scottsdale retains the friendliness and slow pace of life in a small town -- perhaps because stress can't survive on a massage table, golf course or any place where the sun shines more than 330 days a year.

As a result of France's refusal to support the American cause in Iraq, freedom fries, and their cousin, freedom toast, replaced French fries and French toast on the menus of some outraged restaurateurs. That name change, silly as it was, bared a long-simmering cultural antagonism between imperial (American) machismo and a more feminine (French) Epicureanism, and ratcheted it up a notch.",2004-03-12T05:00:00+0000

The explosions, which firefighters said were caused by an electrical fire in an underground transformer, occurred about 11:30 p.m. Diners and workers were evacuated from Virgil's Real BBQ, Viva Pancho, the Times Deli and Jimmy's Corner, a bar. Acrid smoke poured from the manhole and flames rose at least four feet in the air. The fire was extinguished by 12:45, firefighters said. No one was injured. Exploding manhole covers are common in the spring, when salt washes into manholes, corroding wires, which heat up, said Firefighter Paul Iannizzotto, a Fire Department spokesman. The rising temperature increases the pressure inside the manholes, causing the covers to blow off, he added. Lily Koppel (NYT)",2004-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Lady-Slippers Reward Growers' Years of Waiting,"A FEW years ago, I was walking with friends in a rare bit of undisturbed Northeastern woodland when I discovered something even rarer: three pink lady-slippers in full flower. With their plump rosy pouches surmounted by three delicate petals, they bore an uncanny resemblance to their exotic cousins, the Paphiopedilum orchids. Habitat loss has threatened many species of these hardy North American terrestrial orchids (Cypripedium acaule), and I began to wonder about breeding them in captivity. When ''nursery propagated'' cypripedium popped up in a garden catalog, I decided to investigate further.",2004-03-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Why She Went Home," At sixty-five, despite waning lung power, Leonard Milton Fine was still lead oboist of the Newark Symphony Orchestra. He was also one of few musicians in the troupe whom Newark's car thieves hadn't scared off from driving to work; he figured his 1986 Yugo hatchback wasn't tempting even for spare parts. On the evening of the NSO's season opener, he set off down the New Jersey Turnpike with a full car. Next to him in the front, a lugubrious cellist wearing loafers that looked like bedroom slippers stared blankly at the toxic plumage of two dozen industrial smokestacks, which was bleeding into a violet and gold sunset. In the back, Leonard's younger daughter, Phoebe, barely visible beneath a battered cello case covered with stickers from obscure music festivals, attempted to make conversation with the cellist's flute-playing wife, a dark-browed blonde who seemed to have memorized the seating chart of every musical ensemble in the tristate area. Phoebe's left ear was pinned against the neck of the case. As uncomfortable as she was, she considered herself lucky not to be sitting up front, in the death seat. Her father had the alarming habit of turning around while driving to talk to the passengers behind him. Earlier in the trip, while availing them of his many superlative buys on raingear at Burlington Coat Factory, he had narrowly avoided scaling the turnpike divide and then swerved into the middle lane, where he nearly got swiped by an eighteen-wheeler.

A mother of two, a wife and a career woman, she said she longs for the freedom and rest she imagines will come with retirement. Many of us acknowledged that at her age, we had never given a thought to retirement, nor had we lived under the stress experienced by many two-wage-earners today.

It was to mark the launching of the Johns Hopkins University, an institution whose leaders intended not simply to found a new university but to change all of American education; indeed, they sought considerably more than that.

Service was supposed to start last year, but complications with Conrail, which operates freight trains on the same tracks, and neighbors who insisted on speed and time modifications delayed that start. Initial fares have been kept low -- $1.10 for a ride of any distance. Schedules have expanded on weekends to accommodate events along the Delaware River entertainment district in Camden. On weekdays, the last trains leave Trenton and Camden between 9 and 10 p.m. and on weekends, about midnight. It is the first new transit line in South Jersey in 35 years.

us,The Origins of the Final Solution," In a brief two years between the autumn of 1939 and the autumn of 1941, Nazi Jewish policy escalated rapidly from the prewar policy of forced emigration to the Final Solution as it is now understood-the systematic attempt to murder every last Jew within the German grasp. The mass murder of Soviet Jewry had already begun in the late summer of 1941, and only one-half year later the Nazi regime was ready to begin implementing this policy throughout the rest of its European empire and sphere of influence. The study of these 30 months-from September 1939 through March 1942-is crucial for understanding the genesis of the Final Solution and constitutes the core of this book. At this time the Nazi regime stood on the brink of a true watershed event in history. But why, after two millennia of Christian-Jewish antagonism and one millennium of a singular European anti-Semitism, did this watershed event occur in Germany in the middle of the 20th century?

""I had many disabilities,"" he wrote, looking back on his early days. ""I was small; I had endurance but little physical strength; I stammered; I was shy; I had poor health. I had no facility for games."" His miserable childhood left permanent scars, but provided rich material for the poignant, autobiographical Of Human Bondage and for the deeply moving Cakes and Ale. His stammer, a psychological and physical handicap, and his gradual awareness of his homosexuality made him furtive and secretive, and caused ""an instinctive shrinking from my fellow men that has made it difficult for me to enter into any familiarity with them."" A lifelong exile and wanderer, Maugham gave the impression of being icy, remote and arrogant. The love and affection, insight and sympathy that he repressed in everyday life were channeled into the creation of plays and stories. Maugham's teasing combination of passion and tenderness, coldness and cynicism was stamped on his life and work. ",2004-03-14T05:00:00+0000

Their parents pay for tutors to improve their grades and their SAT scores, and they help with essays designed to impress college-admissions officers.

us,Many Ways to Wrap Your Head,"In HEADWRAPS: A Global Journey (PublicAffairs, $35), Georgia Scott explores a common practice that dates back to the initial recording of human history and remains prevalent throughout the world today. Packed with captivating photographs and enlightening details on the practices of covering the human head by the people of 32 countries on five continents, the book discusses the vagaries of head covering: though culturally specific, headwraps transcend the boundaries of sex (men and women use them) and social class. There are cultures and communities in which the use of headwraps hold religious and moral values, as for men and women in North Africa and the women of the former Soviet Republics; in others they are decorative and ceremonial, as in rural Thailand; and in yet others they are used to establish social status and rank, as with the male spiritual leaders and chiefs of northern Nigeria. Scott, a staff artist at The New York Times, does not always adequately document the ethnic diversity of many of the nations she covers; for example, in her discussion of Trinidad and Jamaica, she ignores the sizable groups of ethnic Asians and Europeans as well as the indigenous population, and focuses only on people of African descent. On the other hand, ''Headwraps'' does provide excellent documentation of the increased use of traditional headwraps in nontraditional places and for reasons other than tradition.

us,The Coming of the Third Reich," Is it wrong to begin with Bismarck? On several levels, he was a key figure in the coming of the Third Reich. For one thing, the cult of his memory in the years after his death encouraged many Germans to long for the return of the strong leadership his name represented. For another, his actions and policies in the mid-to-late nineteenth century helped create an ominous legacy for the German future. Yet in many ways he was a complex and contradictory figure, as much European as German, as much modern as traditional. Here, too, his example pointed forwards to the tangled mixture of the new and the old that was so characteristic of the Third Reich. It is worth calling to mind that a mere fifty years separated Bismarck's foundation of the German Empire in 1871 from the electoral triumphs of the Nazis in 1930-32. That there was a connection between the two seems impossible to deny. It was here, rather than in the remote religious cultures and hierarchical polities of the Reformation or the 'Enlightened Absolutism' of the eighteenth century, that we find the first real moment in German history which it is possible to relate directly to the coming of the Third Reich in 1933.

Her auburn-and-gold hair was clipped short. There was a pair of diamonds in each ear, more diamonds on her fingers and a gold chain around her neck. Woodford, who is 50 years old and 5-foot-7, was, as usual, unarmed. She walked past throngs of prisoners, and though she was the first female warden in San Quentin's 152-year history, and all 5,600 inmates were male, there was not a catcall or whistle.

So says the musicologist Michael Lorenz, an expert on the Viennese music of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the proof of the pudding will be served on Thursday in Vienna when the pianist Robert Levin sits down to join Sir Roger Norrington and the Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart to play Mozart's piano concerto in E-flat (K. 271) for the first time under its proper name. For more than a century, Dr. Lorenz says, the identity of the French pianist for whom the young Mozart, above, wrote the piece has baffled Mozart scholars, and the work has been known as the ''Jeunehomme'' Concerto. Dr. Lorenz says that jeune homme, or young man, a reference to Mozart, was the name given to it by a pair of French scholars in a 1912 biography because they couldn't identify the woman for whom he actually wrote it. After that, he says, scholars refrained from further research. Mozart, in a letter to his father, Leopold, after finishing the concerto in January 1777, referred to the pianist as ''jenomy,'' and Leopold referred to her as ''Madame genomai.'' Dr. Lorenz says the mystery woman was actually Victoire Jenamy, a daughter of Jean George Noverre, a famous dancer who was one of Mozart's best friends. Dr. Lorenz says a bit of research in the City Archive of Vienna last year established that Victoire was an excellent pianist, and it was she who commissioned the concerto in Vienna in 1776.

The company said it expected to file its 2003 yearly report, which was due yesterday, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the second quarter.

The first restatement last year fixed accounting for a barter deal with Time Warner.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Cisco Chief Says Dividend May Not Be First Priority,"Cisco Systems will probably pay a dividend at some point in the future, the company's chief executive, John Chambers, said yesterday, but he signaled that for now the company has different plans for deploying excess cash. Mr. Chambers, who is also Cisco's president, also discussed paying a dividend during the annual shareholders meeting of the company last November. But shareholders, he said at a conference yesterday, want Cisco to repurchase company stock, which may mean they view the shares as undervalued. Cisco can repurchase an additional $8.1 billion in stock under its current board-authorized buyback program. As of Jan. 24, Cisco had repurchased 735 million shares under that program, costing $11.9 billion, or $16.14 a share, a Cisco spokeswoman, Terry Anderson, said. Like many other high-tech companies, Cisco, a network equipment maker, has never paid a dividend. Microsoft was among the first to break that mold, starting payment of a dividend early last year. Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., has said it will not hire new employees until its current workers produce, on average, $700,000 a year in revenue. They produced $632,000 each during Cisco's fiscal second quarter, which ended Jan. 24.",2004-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   JAICKS, DAVID P.","JAICKS--David P., 78, a pioneer in food processing and education activist, successfully introduced new technologies to the production and distribution of food processing for an ever larger population, and, among other community actions, was a leader in the integration of local schools in the 1960s and 1970s, died Monday at a nursing home in Ridgewood, NJ. The cause was complications from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Born in Lake Forest, IL, he entered the US Navy in 1943 at the age of 18. The Navy selected him for the V12 program for officer training. In 1945, while the war in the Pacific was still raging, he shipped out to Japan, arriving just after the second atomic bomb. His first task was to lead his men in the SEABEES in the clean-up and re-building of Nagasaki's infrastructure. After the War, Mr. Jaicks took his family to the East Coast to join American Home Products Corporation (now Wyeth) in their foods division. American Home Foods, makers of Chef-BoyAr-Dee, Gulden's Mustard, and Jiffy Pop-Corn, was just beginning to be an important company when he joined in 1964. In 1990 when he retired from the company as CEO and President of seven plants, he had introduced state of the art technology and a major R and D department run by scientists. Mr. Jaicks also led the movement to integrate both in his company and in the community. He campaigned successfully to join the Waldwick Board of Education, ultimately becoming president of the Board. Together with a small band of community activists, he canvassed door-to-door to win an election giving the community the funds to build a school. The Waldwick High School still stands as a monument to that Board. In the 1960s and the 1970s Mr. Jaicks worked tirelessly with Fair Housing and Ridgewood Association of Good Schools (RAGS) to move his new town, Ridgewood, away from de-facto segregation. He had a reputation for scrupulous fairness and for mentoring. ''He showed me that he had faith in me--he pushed me to broaden my expertise and my experiences in the company. Everyone loved him,'' Ken Martin, CFO of Wyeth Corporation, said yesterday. Not content with staying home as a retiree in the 1990s, Mr. Jaicks accepted lengthy tours of duty in Ukraine and Poland working as a volunteer for the Citizens Corps for Democracy and the International Executive Service Corps. Mr. Jaicks, who lived in Ridgewood, NJ with his wife, Nancy, is survived by her, by four sons, Bryan of Ridgewood, Andrew of Tucson, Perry of Mesa, AZ, Cameron of Vail, two stepsons, Raul Cintra-Leite of Saddle Brook, NJ and Alex Cintra-Leite of San Mateo, CA, and five grandchildren.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Hewlett Shareholders Want Options Expensed,"Shareholders of the Hewlett-Packard Company voted Wednesday to approve the expensing of stock options, in a setback for Carleton S. Fiorina, the chairwoman and chief executive officer. A nonbinding proposal from the Massachusetts Laborers' Pension Fund was approved by 1.21 billion shares, with 925 million against, according to a Webcast of the annual shareholder meeting in Houston. The board of directors, which had opposed the measure, will now study the issue, Ms. Fiorina said. She told shareholders that expensing options would put the company at a disadvantage when its results are compared with those of rivals. The Laborers fund, which owns 87,100 shares, said that not expensing options understates the cost of executive compensation and encourages management to foster short-term price appreciation rather than long-term goals, according to Hewlett-Packard's proxy.

Cilo, Jr., writer, advertising executive, loving husband, and father, died Sunday, March 14. He was 65 and lived in South Salem, NY. Mr. Cilo was born in Passaic, NJ. His family moved to Connecticut where he attended Naugatuck High School excelling in literature, calculus, and sports, chiefly baseball. He later earned a BA from the University of Connecticut at Storrs. Mr. Cilo started his advertising career at McCann Erickson in New York City working in the mailroom in a graduate training program. His command of the English language, coupled with a brilliant creative mind, propelled his ascent through several agencies before landing him at the William Esty Agency (now Campbell Mithun Esty) from which he retired in 1992 as Executive VP, Creative Director. It was there that he helped create many of the most effective slogans and campaigns of the '70s and '80s for clients such as Datsun/ Nissan, Minolta, and MasterCard. Upon hearing of Mr. Cilo's death, Gordon Bushell, former Chairman/CEO, William Esty had this to say: ''A man with big, original ideas who could express them in unforgettable words, and presented all like nobody else could. A loved and respected leader.'' After retiring, Mr. Cilo continued his craft in the form of short stories and novels. He was working on his fourth novel at the time of his death. He will be missed for his humor, his conversation, his passion for baseball and music, and his overwhelming capacity for love and the support for others. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor, his son Charles M. Cilo III, his daughter-in-law Jill, and his sister Ruth Nord. A private memorial ceremony will be held in his honor.

Stone, below, the director of the State Division of the Budget, said in a March 2 letter to a committee of state lawmakers working to reform New York's budget-making process. The bipartisan committee, with legislators from the Senate and Assembly, favors moving the start of the fiscal year to May 1 to, among other things, have more time to analyze the annual state budget. The state is likely to miss its budget deadline for the 20th consecutive year. Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Democratic co-chairman of the committee, said he believed that Gov. George E. Pataki would ''reconsider his position'' about a July 1 start date once the legislators finished their work and put forward a clear proposal urging a May 1 start. Mr. Farrell said he believed July 1 was too late because it would leave school districts and local governments waiting too long for information on state aid. Al Baker (NYT)",2004-03-19T05:00:00+0000

Its heyday was 150 years ago, when oil was discovered in the Kern River region, bringing wealth-seeking prospectors from all over the country and Europe. Now, this sprawling community (population 250,000) is a ghostly industrial town, a sleepy Nowheresville in which laborers who toil in the San Joaquin Valley farmbelt saunter around with unironic trucker caps perched high on their heads. The city's appeal isn't readily apparent; you have to dig deep into its native culture to discover how sui generis it truly is. It is the country music capital of the West Coast, for starters, and its polyglot culture (Spanish shepherds settled here in the early 1900's) has also made it the United States capital of Basque cuisine. In the spring and summer, it becomes a hub for outdoor types, with white-water rafting, bicycling and hiking in the nearby Sequoia Forest. As for tourist-friendly gentrification, forget it.

The real question is who the baby's father is, and sharon's not talking. (When the truth comes out, it's clear why.) Yes, all the curleys' Irish working-class peers gossip, but Sharon keeps going to the pub with her dentally disadvantaged girlfriends and happily sings ''Papa, Don't Preach,'' Madonna's tribute to single motherhood, with the karaoke machine.

He was 75. A loving father and husband, a trusted advisor to many, a great sportsman and philanthropist, he had strength and good humor to the end and will be missed by all who knew him. Born June 8, 1928, the son of F. Skiddy von Stade and Kathryne Steele von Stade, he grew up with his seven brothers and sisters in Old Westbury, NY and Aiken, SC.

He served on the boards of the Saratoga Museum of Racing, Greenvale School and Piping Rock Club. For the last 10 years he served as President and then Chairman of the Board of the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. Under his leadership this remarkable institution made many outstanding changes that enhanced its reputation, its collections and its financial strength.

''Jersey Girl,'' by comparison, is a PG-13 film with a Hallmark Channel plot: a high-powered Manhattan music publicist abandons the city, and his career, to raise his daughter after his wife dies in the delivery room. In this case, Mr. Smith has shed the anti-establishment vibe of his earlier movies for what he calls the clichs of mainstream filmmaking.

But whatever the form supposedly used to be -- a historically simplistic melodrama brimming with offensive stereotypes, cardboard conflicts and wooden heroes and villains -- it hasn't been that way in a very long time. From John Ford's ''Searchers'' to Sam Peckinpah's ''Wild Bunch'' to (forgive me, film historians) Kevin Costner's ''Dances With Wolves,'' the western has been dismantled and demythologized almost since its beginning.

It promises to transform a struggling scholar in a field seen as esoteric if estimable into a guy like Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist-cum-farmer who consults for the Pentagon and just sold a new history of the Peloponnesian War for a half-million dollars. Hanson landed the contract even though Donald Kagan, the author of the definitive four-volume work on the same war, recently published a 500-page version intended for the general reader. This Peloponnesian mania is understandable among classicists; the war between Athens and Sparta tore the ancient world apart and was the chosen subject of one of the greatest early historians, Thucydides. For the general reader, though, the urgent need to learn more about the 27-year-long conflict remains far from clear.",2004-03-21T05:00:00+0000

But it's when he talks politics that Mr. Rizzuto sounds like a real radical, for a punk anyway.

us,Man Walks Into a Bookstore,"Ali Smith, whose novel ''Hotel World'' was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize, now brings us, in THE WHOLE STORY AND OTHER STORIES (Anchor, paper, $12), 12 new short stories with surprisingly long reach. ''Gothic,'' about the trouble a woman faces when dealing with the oddball clientele of the bookstore where she works, subtly links the woman's failed rebellion against the store's dress code to her inability to handle a self-promoting neo-Nazi author. Her growing intolerance -- she posts ''No Smoking'' signs in the employee lounge and looks forward to ejecting an eccentric shopper she'd previously tolerated -- raises issues of personal freedom and social responsibility with sly concision. In ''The Universal Story,'' set in another bookstore (Smith's writing often refers, in playfully self-referential ways, to books, myths and storytelling), a faded copy of ''The Great Gatsby'' serves as the fulcrum with which Smith lifts into view a quarter-century of small-town English life, beginning with an entomologically precise recitation of the life span of a fly that has landed on the book. Smith's perspicacity and humor give resonance to the hapless and slightly mad characters who populate these stories: a woman who falls in love with a tree; another pursued by an imaginary band of bagpipers; the one-armed leader of a gang that tries to rob a fast-food shop with gardening tools. ''The Heat of the Story,'' the volume's finest, is a droll and touching tale of three women who, on a cold night, keep one another warm with stories of childhood and love. It achieves grandeur with measured effects, astutely figurative language (the women, drunk, arrive exuding ''liquid happiness'') and a refreshing lack of cataclysm or melodrama.

The adult population numbers about 15, and during the Great Depression, when the film takes place, these people's lives are busy, joyless and harsh. The hard-bitten folk who inhabited the Northwestern factory town in ''Dancer in the Dark,'' Mr. von Trier's previous foray into Americana, at least had a community theater, but the most Dogville can offer is some meetings presided over by a self-styled intellectual named Tom Edison Jr. (the English actor Paul Bettany).",2004-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Cilo, Jr., writer, advertising executive, loving husband, and father, died Sunday, March 14. He was 65 and lived in South Salem, NY. Mr. Cilo was born in Passaic, NJ. His family moved to Connecticut where he attended Naugatuck High School excelling in literature, calculus, and sports, chiefly baseball. He later earned a BA from the University of Connecticut at Storrs. Mr. Cilo started his advertising career at McCann Erickson in New York City working in the mailroom in a graduate training program. His command of the English language, coupled with a brilliant creative mind, propelled his ascent through several agencies before landing him at the William Esty Agency (now Campbell Mithun Esty) from which he retired in 1992 as Executive VP, Creative Director. It was there that he helped create many of the most effective slogans and campaigns of the '70s and '80s for clients such as Datsun/ Nissan, Minolta, and MasterCard. Upon hearing of Mr. Cilo's death, Gordon Bushell, former Chairman/CEO, William Esty had this to say: ''A man with big, original ideas who could express them in unforgettable words, and presented all like nobody else could. A loved and respected leader.'' After retiring, Mr. Cilo continued his craft in the form of short stories and novels. He was working on his fourth novel at the time of his death. He will be missed for his humor, his conversation, his passion for baseball and music, and his overwhelming capacity for love and the support for others. He leaves behind his wife Eleanor, his son Charles M. Cilo III, his daughter-in-law Jill, and his sister Ruth Nord. A private memorial ceremony will be held in his honor.

The response from loved ones, primarily family, has a more powerful impact on the child than the abuse itself. I have seen children who were not believed, when parents took the side of the abuser.

It has sued to stop a pair of coffee shops in Shanghai from using the name xingbake. This is the age of globalization, after all. In Chinese, star = xing, and in a way Starbucks = Xingbake. ''We came first,'' Xingbake's general manager said. ''We can't lose.'' His name is Mao. .An Atlanta music writer known as bill wyman received a cease-and-desist letter from lawyers representing the former Rolling Stones bass player known as Bill Wyman: demanding, that is, that he ''cease and desist'' using his name. In responding, Bill Wyman No. 1 pointed out that Bill Wyman No. 2 had been born William George Perks. . The German car company known as Dr. Ing. h.c.F. Porsche AG has fought a series of battles to protect the name carrera. But another contender is a Swiss village, postal code 7122. ''The village Carrera existed prior to the Porsche trademark,'' Christoph Reuss of Switzerland wrote to Porsche's lawyers. ''Porsche's use of that name constitutes a misappropriation of the good will and reputation developed by the villagers of Carrera.'' He added, for good measure, ''The village emits much less noise and pollution than Porsche Carrera.'' He didn't mention that Jos Carreras, the opera singer, was embroiled in a name dispute of his own. The car company, meanwhile, also claims trademark ownership of the numerals 911. . A Canadian businessman known as Jeff Burgar, living in High Prairie, a small town in Alberta, owns lots of names in dot-com territory. He registered J.R.R. Tolkien's name as an Internet domain in 1996 and held on to jrrtolkien.com until this year, when a panel of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) took it away from him. The name Tolkien -- just the name, as distinct from the prose, stories, characters and ideas -- is big business. Others who claim to own pieces of it -- as a brand and a trademark, either registered or unregistered -- are heirs, publishers and moviemakers; never mind the several thousand individuals worldwide who happen to come by the surname honestly. Burgar, meanwhile, has taken some other names in vain: celine dion, albert einstein, michael crichton and about 1,500 more. In many of these cases, battles have ensued -- even the ghost of Albert Einstein fought back, via the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Burgar loses most of these cases, but not all.

The family lived in Florence until 1923 when she, her mother and her sister moved to Paris. There she met and, in 1927, married Julien Levy. They moved to New York that same year where they started, in 1931, the pioneering Julien Levy Gallery, showing contemporary photography, the Surrealists and later, the Neo-Romantics. After her divorce in 1942, she met and married in 1944 the Bauhaus painter, designer and architect Herbert Bayer. In 1946, they moved to Aspen, Colorado, where they were both closely involved with the development of Aspen as a ski resort and a cultural center. The Bayers moved to Montecito, California in 1974. After Bayer's death in 1985 she stayed on in Montecito, continuing to play an active part in the art world as she had done since her youth and managing the Bayer estate, the bulk of which she donated to the Denver Art Museum.

He said talks had not progressed and he declined to comment on a Korea Economic Daily report that the venture would cost $1.7 billion. Last year, companies in China bought $19.2 billion worth of chips that go into products like mobile phones made by Nokia and Samsung Electronics, and demand is expected to grow 41 percent this year. STMicroelectronics, a French-Italian company, and Hynix need to invest to make more chips at lower cost to keep up with rivals. Hynix's net loss widened 19 percent, to 2.3 trillion won in 2003, when the company lost its third-place spot in computer memory chip production to Infineon Technologies of Germany, according to the market researcher IDC. An STMicroelectronics spokeswoman, Joanne Tan, was not available for comment.

For many years, Mr. Connolly was one of the top intellectual property litigators in the country. Among the U.S. and international clients for whom he tried cases were Pfizer, General Foods, General Motors, Kodak, Scott Paper, Rohm & Haas, Siemens and North American Philips. Mr. Connolly was also a Director of the Sprague Electric Company in Williamstown, MA. He was one of the first Delaware members of the American College of Trial lawyers, an organization whose membership is limited to no more than one percent of the lawyers in each state. He tried many cases in the New York courts. His offices were located in Midtown Manhattan and he was a member of the Canadian Club of New York, located in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and the Metropolitan Club. Mr. Connolly was born in Boston, Mass. on November 8, 1905. He graduated from MIT in 1927 and Harvard Law School in 1930. Following law school, he worked for the Universal Oil Company in Chicago. He then came to Wilmington where he worked in the Patent Department of the Dupont Company. After eight years, he decided to found his own law firm. The small practice that he started is now the firm of Connolly, Bove, Lodge, and Hutz, with over eighty-five attorneys in Wilmington and Washington, D.C. His son Arthur G. Connolly, Jr. and his grandson, Arthur G. Connolly, III are partners in the firm. In 1926, Mr. Connolly was critically wounded in an accident that threatened his life. While working his way through college, he served as a Lieutenant in the Army Reserves. As he was instructing a training program at MIT, a recruit prematurely pulled the pin of a hand grenade, causing it to explode in Lt. Connolly's face. Doctors at Cambridge Hospital feared that Lt. Connolly would never regain his vision. After several months in the Intensive Care Unit, he had recovered completely. A long and active participant in charitable causes, Mr. Connolly served for twenty-five years as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Laffey-McHugh Foundation. He was also President of the Arguild Foundation, which he co-founded with his wife Gerardine. Some of Mr. Connollys happiest moments were spent on the shores of Sebago Lake in Maine, surrounded by members of his large and loving family. Five generations of his family had vacationed there for many decades. He was also a member of the Wilmington Country Club and the Union League Club of Chicago. Mr. Connolly was preceded in death in 1986 by his wife of almost fifty years, Gerardine Laffey Connolly. He is survived by his six children and their spouses: Arthur G. Jr and his wife, Joan of Wilmington; Dr. Ronald G. Connolly and his wife,Sieglinde, of Lafayette, CA; Dr. Christopher G. Connolly of Lexington, M A; Thomas A. Connolly and his wife, Nouchine, of New York City; Mary C. Braun and her husband, Wilson, of Wilmington; and Gerardine C. DiSabatino, and her husband, Andy, of Aspen, CO. He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren: Arthur G. Connolly, III; Amy C. Doherty, Michael M. Connolly, Gerardine A. Connolly, Ronald C. Connolly, Jr, Maria S. Connolly, Christina A. Connolly, Anna J. Connolly, Christopher B. Connolly, Lisa C. DiSabatino, Megan C.H. DiSabatino, Courtney C. Braun and Wilson J.C.

Nokia agreed to buy 31.1 percent of Symbian from Psion in February, increasing its stake to 63.3 percent. Ericsson, the largest of Symbian's other shareholders, will team up with Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications to buy some of that stock, a spokeswoman, Aase Lindskog, said.

Shareholders of Symbian, which is based in London, have agreed that should any of them want to sell a stake, the rest have a right to purchase a certain proportion. Other shareholders are the cellphone makers Siemens, Samsung Electronics and Sony Ericsson. Nokia, Motorola and Siemens are among companies battling for a share of the market for smart phones as growth slows for conventional handsets.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   MACIAG, THOMAS, PHD.","MACIAG--Thomas, PhD., internationally recognized molecular and cell biologist, died March 8, 2004 in Freeport, ME, at 57. Dr. Maciag was a scientist of the highest distinction, with extraordinary intellect, keen insight and an artist's vision of how complex biological systems work. He made seminal contributions in angiogenesis. His discovery of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) led him to be the first to propagate human endothelial cells in vitro for long periods of time and to identify many genes for angiogenic behavior. The generation of scientists he mentored in the fields of angiogenesis, growth factor biology, proteases, cell growth and development were profoundly affected by his aggressive and fearless approach to science. Born in 1946 in Bayonne, NJ, he earned a B.A. from Rutgers University in 1968, and served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1969 to 1971. He earned his Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975 and did postdoctoral study there. Highlights from his career include appointment as Assistant Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School in 1980 and work as Head of the Department of Molecular Biology, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD with teaching at George Washington University. In 1997 he accepted the challenge to establish the Center for Molecular Medicine at Maine Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI). NIH recognized his success with an $11 million award for a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in angiogenesis. Dr. Maciag was Scientific Director of MMCRI and Presidential Professor of the Biomedical Sciences, University of Maine. He published over 150 scientific articles, earned many patents, and received numerous awards for his contributions to science. He was an accomplished artist whose interpretations of cellular function were featured on the covers of scientific journals. Tom is survived by his wife, Lorrie, and son, Andrei, of Freeport, ME, his parents, Edward and Agnes Maciag, and sister, Arlene Arzulowicz, of Sommerville, NJ.

Olesen's women's prison drama, ''In Your Hands,'' like so many Scandinavian films, is heavily shadowed by the titanic influence of Ingmar Bergman. This Danish film, which has its first of three screenings tonight as part of the New Directors/New Films series, explores notions of guilt, faith, superstition and conflicting loyalty with the same do-or-die intensity that has bedeviled several decades of tormented souls in Mr. Bergman's movies. Because the conflicts roil inside the walls of a prison housing glum, angry women, the film quickly establishes a mood of intense claustrophobia, which only deepens as it continues.",2004-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,'Against All Enemies'," Iexpected to go back to a round of meetings examining what the next attacks could be, what our vulnerabilities were, what we could do about them in the short term. Instead, I walked into a series of discussions about Iraq. At first I was incredulous that we were talking about something other than getting al Qaeda. Then I realized with almost a sharp physical pain that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were going to try to take advantage of this national tragedy to promote their agenda about Iraq. Since the beginning of the administration, indeed well before, they had been pressing for a war with Iraq. My friends in the Pentagon had been telling me that the word was we would be invading Iraq sometime in 2002. ",2004-03-28T05:00:00+0000

In fact, immediately after taking office last summer, the two things the 27-year-old asked his new village attorney to check on were, first, the state and local beaver trapping laws, since a dog had recently been caught and killed in a beaver trap on the old Bienstock property -- a huge New Paltz scandal that was soon labeled Beavergate; and second, whether a mayor could perform gay marriages. The attorney, Spencer McLaughlin, is a Republican legislator from Orange County and a former deputy executive director of the New York City Human Rights Commission under Ed Koch. That West would turn to a Republican for advice was a surprise to the people who thought the mayor, who was elected on the Green Party line, was a radical liberal activist about to turn the town into a socialist enclave. In his reply to West, McLaughlin noted that the law is unclear. ''That's because the laws were written around the late 19th century, and no one ever conceived of wanting to do this then,'' McLaughlin said recently. The attorney ended his memo to mayor saying, ''That's a very long-winded explanation of why you can't perform a same-sex marriage, but does not address the issue of whether you should or not.''",2004-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Passions of the Repeat Viewers,"ON St. Patrick's Day, March 17, Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ'' was three weeks into its $300 million (and counting) run and still drawing a big enough crowd to make it the nation's top box-office draw. The film has generated passionate opinions -- among critics, who have not been kind to it, and among audience members, many of whom have been so moved by what they saw that they returned for second and third screenings. To find out why the controversial film is still attracting viewers at a point in its release when most other films have already tapered off, Alex Abramovich visited the AMC Empire 25 on West 42nd Street. Over the course of 16 screenings that day, 642 people had attended the film, resulting in $6,091 worth of tickets sales. Some members of the audience were out-of-towners who said they had waited to see it while vacationing in New York, and some were New Yorkers returning for repeat viewings. No one said they had come expressly for the gore, but most said that the violence was warranted by what they saw as the film's moral: that the degree of Christ's suffering was directly proportional to Christ's love for mankind. In some cases, at least, what the viewers had gotten out of the movie seemed to depend entirely on what they brought to it. Herewith, a sampling of their comments.",2004-03-28T05:00:00+0000

It is not enough to have the right motives; a war-making administration also has to know what it is doing. The important thing about the failure to find W.M.D.'s and the failure to pacify Iraq and the failure to protect the treasures, the infrastructure and the women of Iraq is that these failures were foreseen by many who opposed the war. The war could never have gone the way the Bush administration claimed that it would because the administration didn't have the wherewithal to make that happen.

Each is cleverly matched with a drawing. Representative Charles B. Rangel considers ''Sugar Hill Statesman''; the Rev. James A. Forbes discusses the preacher of ''Yeah, Men!''; Eartha Kitt celebrates ''Cocoa Venus,'' a smoldering odalisque. Drawings of Harlem's legendary dances show Hirschfeld's line at its greatest: the Lindy Hop and the Boogie-Woogie carry the book from its Harlem pages to ''Hirschfeld's Gallery of African American Legends,'' a sampling of illustrations from The New York Times. If this section is perhaps a victim of somewhat lazy editing (what, for instance, is Halle Berry accepting the Oscar doing in the middle of the introductory essay on the Harlem Renaissance?) the two halves are indeed linked -- for Hirschfeld, the great chronicler of theater, Harlem was but another stage. This goes some way toward explaining the inscrutably masked countenance that features on so many of the figures depicted. Many of the habitus of Hirschfeld's Harlem have no eyes -- that is to say, they can't look back. As has often been true, Harlem remains in the eye of the beholder.

Coatee's rhythmic reassurances of the Lord's (and her own rather more palpable) protection always sent me straight to dreamland. But after my mother finished her song, I'd lie awake for hours, imagining -- yearning for, really -- the party that was ''getting a glow on,'' and the ''singin''' that ''fills the air.'' By the time I'd gotten around to ''better save a chair,'' I had the whole scene in my head: a gilded ballroom chair waiting for me next to a dance floor on a wide green lawn. The orchestra would be playing, and I'd arrive, late, ''in the shank of the night/When the doin's are right,'' trailing a white mink stole behind me. All the women would have on diamonds and gardenias, and all the men would have already shed their white dinner jackets.

The trip takes an hour. I'm 28, and I work in a savings bank. My wife and I have a baby, so I'm often tired these days. As I sometimes do, I fell asleep in my seat. Suddenly I heard an explosion, and then, right away, another. When I opened my eyes, the world around me was bathed in white smoke. I was half asleep and half awake. It was a choking smoke, the kind produced by combustion. Just then I felt something hit me on the head and something else strike my back. I might have been in great pain, but I wasn't able to judge at that moment. All I could think about was escaping the smoke. Someone yelled out, ''Jump through the window!'' By great fortune, I was seated in the front of the train car, right next to a window. I didn't have to break it, because the glass had shattered. It took about 10 seconds for the smoke to clear. I could see three trains, the one I'd been riding in and two others. That was when I realized we had suffered a terrorist attack. My car, well, the windows and doors were gone.

I thought that my shiny gold velour pants actually looked good. I kept a giant sack of Nabisco chocolate-chip cookies under my bed so that they might be available in an emergency -- a flood, say, or a hurricane -- that made it harder to get to the grocery store. From the safe distance of 43, ''12'' looks less an age than a disease, and for the most part, I've been able to forget all about it -- not the events and the people, but the feelings that gave them meaning. But there are exceptions. A few people, and a few experiences, simply refuse to be trivialized by time. There are teachers with a rare ability to enter a child's mind; it's as if their ability to get there at all gives them the right to stay forever. I once had such a teacher.

Pot smoke wafted down to them along with other alarming vegetarian burnt smells, brown rice flambe or tofu gone wrong. A perpetual low-grade party reigned upstairs. There were muffled shrieks, more of the furniture wrestling, comings and goings late at night. When, after a time, they complained, they got nowhere. The kid was too stoned, his life already too full of mess and distraction for anything they said to register. The landlord was no help, nor were the police, unless they wanted to get him busted for the drugs. Even under the circumstances that seemed like a crummy thing to do.

I remember the occasion clearly because it was the birthday of my ex-fianc, almost a year to the date that I sort of, more or less, left him at the altar. Still guilt-ridden (but happily about to leave New York for an extended stay in New Orleans), I thought I should create a celebration, one in which we'd emphasize his birthday rather than my departure and finally close the door on what was left of our relationship. So I assembled my own version of Capote's swans, those chic society ladies like Babe Paley and Gloria Guinness; mine were Joan Buck, Kathleen Tynan and my childhood friend M.T. -- and they did not let me down. We hauled out all our jewels and finery (I wore a black Chanel suit, my first), picked up the birthday boy in a Town Car and spent the rest of the night lavishly fussing over him -- and drinking, a lot. We started with Champagne and caviar and the excellent foie gras terrine and progressed through many bottles of Puligny-Montrachet to those chocolate and Grand Marnier souffls you had to order ahead of time.

Created in 1824-25, the painting, an oil on canvas depicting the Watzmann mountain in the Alps, is a key work of German romanticism and, at more than 4 feet 5 inches by 5 feet 7 inches one of the few large Friedrich paintings. In 1937 the museum bought ''Der Watzmann'' from a Berliner, Martin Brunn, a Jew who was forced to sell it to finance his escape from the Nazi terror. The painting remained the property of the Nationalgalerie until 1999, when the heirs of Mr. Brunn reclaimed and then resold it to the Deka-Bank of Germany, which lent it to the museum on a permanent basis last week. Chancellor Schrder called the return of the painting to its Jewish owners the historical and ethical obligation of Germany. Nonetheless, he said, ''we will not be able to undo the injustice.''

His first known television appearance was as a backup musician on the locally produced ''Night Train.''

Should the expanded center open, the two men want the N.F.L. to approve a Super Bowl game at the center within three years of its opening. Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)",2004-03-30T05:00:00+0000

Shareholders of Metrocall, which is based in Alexandria, Va., will receive $150 million in cash and a 28 percent stake in the combined business, the companies said. Based on Arch's closing price of $23.96 Friday and 19.9 million Arch shares outstanding, the stock portion is valued at about $131.3 million. Metrocall and Arch are seeking to cut expenses, increase sales and sell a broader array of products. The companies, which exited bankruptcy protection in 2002, face pressure from carriers like Nextel, which sell paging services along with voice calling. The indicated purchase price is less than Metrocall's market value on Friday of about $409.3 million. Shares of Metrocall fell $5.79, to $69.15. Arch shares rose $8.35, to $32.31. The transaction combines Arch's 4.4 million customers who generated $597 million in revenue last year, with Metrocall's 3.5 million users and $337 million in sales in 2003.",2004-03-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: City Lifts Disputed Co-Op Fee,"A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the city in an effort to overturn a $50 fee on co-op sales and transfers. But the city said yesterday that it would stop collecting the fees. The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court last week, claims that the city's Department of Finance illegally charges a $50 fee every time a co-op is sold or transferred. The fee should not apply to co-ops, the suit contends, because co-op sales or transfers involve the exchange of shares in a corporation rather than real estate. Aaron Shmulewitz, a lawyer who is representing the plaintiffs, estimated that the city had collected more than $1 million in such fees. Martha E. Stark, commissioner of the Finance Department, said in a statement that the department had reviewed the fee. ''Accordingly,'' she said, ''Finance will identify those who paid a fee for nondeed transactions after Jan. 1, 2003, and provide refunds where appropriate and will stop collecting fees on these transactions.'' Mr. Shmulewitz said his clients would continue to pursue the suit. Motoko Rich (NYT)",2004-03-31T05:00:00+0000

The company, based in Gtersloh, said net profit fell to 154 million euros ($187 million) from 928 million euros a year earlier. Sales dropped 8 percent, to 16.8 billion euros, partly because currency exchange rates reduced revenue from the United States, which accounts for 25 percent of Bertelsmann's sales. The chief executive, Gunter Thielen, above, said that after last year's restructuring, the company would be turning ''from consolidation to attack,'' helped by 2 billion euros it has available for acquisitions over the next three years.
