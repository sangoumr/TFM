By the fall, some three months after the closings -- and long after demonstrations at the five other closed houses (in Harlem, Brooklyn and Queens) had faded -- the protest at Engine Company 212 was still going strong. Firefighters and local residents draped the facade of the two-story, redbrick building on a scrubby section of Wythe Avenue with banners reading ''fire cuts kill'' and ''budgets slashed, brooklyn burned.'' In a tent on the sidewalk in front of the firehouse, volunteers from the neighborhood took turns sleeping each night.

In fact, Whitlock may remind moviegoers of Xavier Quinn, the relaxed police chief in that overly relaxed movie. Quinn heads the force on a sun-dappled Caribbean island; in ''Out of Time,'' which opened Friday, Whitlock polices a small Florida beach community.

But this scene is not simply based on reality; it is based on a documentary about reality. Right down to the clownish yellow outfit, poolside setting and campy, drag-queen voice, Mr. Green's fake interview mimics an actual interview from a 1997 Cinemax documentary also called ''Party Monster'' and also made by the co-directors of the new movie, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.",2003-10-05T05:00:00+0000

These were but a few of the colorful New York gin slingers who were as well known to their thirsty patrons during Prohibition as the Broadway performers that Hirschfeld would later immortalize. He frequently drew satiric cartoons for magazines like Americana (which he edited with Alexander King) and The New Masses, and traveled around the world with pen and sometimes crayon in hand. According to the introduction by Pete Hamill, ''The Speakeasies of 1932'' reveals a lost world -- ''part social history, part artifact of urban archaeology, part simple reporting on the long history of human folly.'' As a personal artistic record, it also reveals an artist who had not yet found his mtier but was no amateur, either. Hirschfeld possessed a sharp eye and keen knack for capturing the nuance and gesture of his subjects. And while his black-and-white sketches relied too much on clumsy brush shading, which he later rejected for the purity of the pen-and-ink line, key elements of his graphic personality shine through in his idiosyncratic, comic rendering of hands, eyes, noses and mouths.

us,Unambiguously Cindy,"Cindy Sherman started shooting her ''Film Stills'' right after she moved to New York City in 1977, the summer of Sam and the last blackout. She cast herself as imaginary actresses in fictional roles from the 40's, 50's and 60's -- as she put it, the era of pointy bras and stiletto heels, for which there was no nostalgia yet. She showed the first of the stills late that same year in Buffalo, where she studied. She somehow lost the negatives and contact sheets. A decade later someone found them. They included this picture, which Sherman chose not to print then but now has put into her book ''The Complete Untitled Film Stills,'' to be published this month by the Museum of Modern Art. It is a shot she staged in her loft downtown: a woman in silhouette with a blond wig, her face obscured by the glare from a light stand. ''The image seemed too mysterious to me,'' she said the other day. ''I thought you couldn't see the character. But now I find her emblematic of the whole group. It's a perfectly ambiguous picture.''",2003-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,On The Edge Of The Neo-70's,"A few years ago, if you rode the D train from Brooklyn to Manhattan, your peripheral vision might have been surprised by a stroboscopic flicker of color at the mouth of the tunnel leading out onto the span of the Manhattan Bridge. If you adjusted your angle of vision properly, you could make out, through pillars and support walls, the bright Krylon hues and characteristic bubble letters of classic wild- style graffiti. By then, the M.T.A.'s subway cars were being made of special paint-resistant stainless steel, and those 50 feet or so of transfigured wall were like a secret museum, a preserved -- more probably an overlooked -- subterranean shrine to a bygone city. I remember once overhearing a young boy ask his mother what those words and pictures were. ''What's graffiti?'' he asked her, and she provided the responsible parental explanation, emphasizing the dangerous, rule-breaking nature of the act. Without knowing it, the child resuscitated an ancient civic and aesthetic controversy -- a standoff, really, between the civic impact of graffiti and its artistic status. ''I think it's beautiful,'' he said.",2003-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,American Woman," Red Hook is little more than the junction of a couple of roads, with a farm store, a church and graveyard, a diner. And the post office, a small square cement building with RED HOOK NY 12571 spelled out in metal letters across the flat gray facade. He keeps flying through this sparse nexus of structures, first along the south-north road, then, when he finally manages to slow down and make the turn, along the east-west. He has the idea that the rest of the town must lie just farther on, and that the diner and farm store and church and post office are a far-flung outpost, but he keeps ending up twenty-odd miles away in front of a sign welcoming him to a new town, and so he keeps turning back and retracing his route. He doesn't even see houses in Red Hook, just fence lines along the roads, a dirt drive sometimes winding away. Some of the fences contain fields and some just grass and grazing animals, but everywhere there are smooth humps of hills and distant darknesses of untouched woodland, interesting vistas to the harried urban man. He's enjoying tearing up and down these roads, like swinging hard through the same arc again and again, and catching the same glimpse of the sorry little huddle at the center point, and he keeps at it for a while pointlessly, up down, zoom zoom, but finally he's forced to conclude that he's not missing anything. At the post office he parks and goes in to take a look at her box. If there were a tiny window in the little metal door he would stoop and peer in, but there isn't. At the diner he orders coffee and a jelly donut and tries to figure out where all the people live. A man in overalls asks another man at the counter how to get somewhere. ""I'm from over-river,"" he explains. Back in his car Frazer studies the map. The Hudson lies west of here, about a ten-minute drive on these roads. Might be pretty. Frazer knows he is possessed of the skills to solve such problems as the one that lies before him. He can recognize, for example, that right now he is looking too hard at the wrong thing, and missing the point. He needs to do something else, maybe even give up for the day, find a bar and a motel, and start fresh in the morning. He should have realized that she wouldn't live here; she wouldn't want to be too near the post office. Yet she wouldn't want to travel too far. This is the sort of zero-sum compromise she makes all the time; Frazer knows this about her, having been subjected to the same flawed formulation. Trust Frazer or spurn him? A little of both? He notices, thinking of the man in overalls from over-river, that there aren't so many bridges: just four in the 150-mile stretch from the city to Albany. One lies due west of here, but Frazer's willing to bet that Jenny wouldn't cross the river for her mail. Too much traffic concentration, too confined; there's no good exit from a bridge. He puts an X on Red Hook, then estimates a half hour's driving distance and draws a circle around Red Hook with that radius. He does this mostly to amuse himself, but also because he believes in the inflexibility, predictability, knowability of people. They never stray far from their familiar realms of being. The most shocking act, closely examined, is just a louder version of some habitual gesture. No one is ever ""out of character."" That idea just makes Frazer laugh. ",2003-10-05T05:00:00+0000

Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is contagious, and the Health Department said many of the children are classmates or playmates. They range in age from three months to 14 years old. The two adults who are infected are parents or caretakers of infected children. The first cases were spotted in August, the most recent one on Wednesday. The health commissioner, Dr. Joshua Lipsman, said vaccination would not make someone completely immune, but the illness is generally milder in those who have been vaccinated. &#0160;&#0160;(AP) ",2003-10-06T05:00:00+0000

The circumstances of his deportation, despite his traveling on a Canadian passport, became a thorny issue in Canadian-American relations. United States officials said they had been acting on tips from Canadian law enforcement agencies, while Canada largely denied those claims and had lately lobbied for Mr. Arar's return to Canada. The Canadian foreign affairs minister, Bill Graham, said Mr. Arar would not be taken into custody on his return to Canada. Colin Campbell (NYT)",2003-10-07T05:00:00+0000

An I.B.M. lawyer, David DiMeglio, said the Court of Appeal for the Sixth Appellate District ''ought to weigh in'' on whether there is enough evidence for cases brought by two former workers, James Moore and Alida Hernandez, for a jury trial. Judge Robert Baines of Superior Court in Santa Clara County yesterday denied I.B.M.'s motion to delay the cases pending the appeal. The workers' cases would be the first of hundreds of similar cases filed in California, New York and Minnesota that accuse I.B.M. of not warning workers that toxic chemicals used at the company's plants could cause cancer. Mr. Moore has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Ms. Hernandez has breast cancer. Their lawyer, Richard Alexander, said I.B.M. was trying to stall. ''I.B.M. does not want this case in front of the public because of their outrageous treatment of their workers,'' he said.

The suits followed cases against file-sharing services like Napster. The industry is also promoting its own fee-based online services.

Supporters of the ban had argued that chemicals used to treat sewage harmed fish and other aquatic life. The extended ban will go into effect immediately, with a one-year exemption for commercial vessels longer than 225 feet or 20 feet in draft, which need to install special holding tanks. Boats may lawfully discharge treated waste at 35 stations spread along the 153-mile ban zone. Stacy Albin (NYT)",2003-10-10T05:00:00+0000

Instead, it's something not seen in movie theaters for a long time: an intelligent, modern screwball comedy, a minor classic on the order of competent, fast-talking curve balls about deception and greed like Mitchell Leisen's ''Easy Living'' and Billy Wilder's ''Major and the Minor.''",2003-10-10T05:00:00+0000

The signing follows two years in which the Legislature and the governor appropriated no new funds for the Superfund program because they could not agree on cleanup guidelines. The legislation provides $120 million a year to clean up the state's 800 polluted sites still awaiting action, as well as $15 million a year to start a program to encourage the development of defunct industrial sites. The money would come from a combination of bond sales and fees on industry. The new law establishes tax credits and relief from liability for pollution to urge developers to take on projects in blighted areas. In addition, the new law alters cleanup standards for some old industrial sites to take into account the future use of the land, rather than holding developers to a pristine standard. James C.

In 1948, Life magazine featured Madison as its pick for the best place to live in America; thankfully, not much has changed.

The legislation provides $120 million a year to clean up the state's 800 polluted sites still awaiting action, as well as $15 million a year to start a program to encourage the development of defunct industrial sites. The money would come from a combination of bond sales and fees on industry. The new law establishes tax credits and relief from liability for pollution to urge developers to take on projects in blighted areas.

A passionate American, he shared his musical gifts across the country, touring in his famous piano van. His love of baseball was confirmed when his beloved Detroit Tigers made him an honorary team member. On November 26, 2000, Manhattan School of Music was honored to celebrate his 75th birthday with a special concert and dinner creating the endowed Eugene Istomin Scholarship for Piano. The entire Manhattan School of Music family -- Board of Trustees, faculty, staff and students--extend our most heartfelt sympathies to Mrs. Istomin and her family.

His savvy widow, Dona Verdugo, remarried and held on for decades, establishing legal title to the land once Mexico gained independence from Spain.

us,You'd Think Columbus Discovered New Jersey,"In the rivalry between the Garden and Empire States, New Jersey is the clear winner in one arena: it has more monuments to Columbus than New York -- or any other state for that matter, according to Peter van der Krogt, a map historian from the University of Utrecht, who tracks Columbus monuments around the world. Specifically, Mr. van der Krogt said New Jersey had 32, and that New York was second with 24. The first monument to Columbus was created in Genoa in the 16th century, said the Dutch historian, while the first to appear in the United States was in Baltimore in 1792. The first statue of Columbus in New Jersey was erected in Phillipsburg in 1892. Hoboken and Jersey City came next, and others followed, including one by Gaetano Federici that was erected in Paterson in 1953. Federici, who was Paterson's favorite sculptor, created about 40 public sculptures and reliefs within a two-mile radius of city hall in Paterson, including a statue of Senator William Hughes outside the county courthouse and ''America,'' a war memorial in Westside Park. His larger-than-life statue of Columbus in Paterson's Federici Park portrays the explorer on his triumphant return to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand in 1493. There is also a plaster model of the same statue at Passaic County Community College's Hamilton Club Building, which has several art collections, including the Federici Studio Collection of more than 500 objects -- including plaster sculptures, molds, tools, furniture, photographs and other items associated with the sculpture, along with a re-creation of Federici's studio. At 1 p.m. next Sunday, Federici's descendants will be honored at a ceremony at the Hamilton Club Building. The event, ''Celebration of Paterson, Words, Sights and Sound'' -- to support arts programs and scholarships for youths in Paterson -- will honor several native sons and daughters, including the jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli and the poet Maria Mazziotti Gillan.

us,The 50-Year Hoffman-Hackman History,"LONG before they'd made the acquaintance of Warren Beatty and Mike Nichols, and long before they'd won enough Oscars and Golden Globes to play a nice game of chess, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman were a mismatched pair of struggling, idealistic actors who found solace in each other's company -- first in classes at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1956, where they played bongos on the roof, and then later in a cold-water flat in Manhattan, where Mr. Hoffman crashed in Mr. Hackman's kitchen until he was banished to the couch of some unwitting dupe named Robert Duvall. Though Mr. Hackman and Mr. Hoffman (now 73 and 66, respectively) have been friends for nearly half a century, they never worked on a film together until ''Runaway Jury,'' the latest installment in the John Grisham franchise.

In any event, the imagery of the Crusades was lodged strongly in his mind.

us,Ms. Macbeth and Her Cousin: The Women of 'Mystic River',"ONE of the most haunting scenes in Clint Eastwood's ''Mystic River'' -- a film that consists almost entirely of haunting scenes -- comes just before the end. The main dramatic action, we have every reason to suspect, is complete: a murder has been solved, another life has been taken in a misguided attempt at retribution and the fates of the three main characters, boyhood friends bound together by old trauma and fresh tragedy, have been sorted out. A long, climactic night of revelation and confrontation is over, and the weary streets of Boston are flooded with hard autumnal light. The break of day brings a new insight, one that has less to do with the facts of the story than with its meaning. All along, ''Mystic River'' has seemed, most obviously, to be about those three men -- Dave, Sean and Jimmy -- who still live in the shadow of Dave's abduction and molestation as a boy years before. But it turns out to be just as much about three (or more) damaged families, about the terror and mystery of marriage and about the fateful actions of two women. (Their place in ''Mystic River'' will be hard to discuss without revealing some of the movie's many secrets; I'll try to be circumspect, but you may want to finish reading this after you've seen the movie.)",2003-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,What Price Music?,"Since the introduction of vinyl records after World War II, recorded music has assumed many shapes and sizes, each one coming with a higher price tag than the last. Eight-track tapes cost a dollar more than LP's when they rose to popularity in the early 1970's, and cassettes commanded a premium over eight-tracks. And when CD's made their debut in the mid-1980's, record labels sold the shiny discs for $18, more than double the price for the same music on LP's and cassettes that cost more to manufacture. Unlike those formats, which the industry adopted voluntarily and marketed vigorously, the latest shift-- to digitized versions of songs that can be distributed online-- have been thrust upon it, the outgrowth of a technology it could not control. Battered by a sales slump it attributes largely to digital piracy and heartened by a limited test with Apple computer owners, this fall the record industry is trying to catch up with its file-swapping customers: the major labels and many independents have agreed to deconstruct the album, allowing anyone with a computer to buy any of hundreds of thousands of individual songs. Soon huge catalogs of every genre of music will be available for sale on the Internet from over a dozen retailers, bearing the blessing and license agreements of the major record labels.",2003-10-12T05:00:00+0000

But that space looks, through a wall of sliding glass doors, into a deep green, lushly planted garden. And what appears from a distance to look an awful lot like a carport projecting from the house's side is actually an outdoor dining room, complete with an enormous fireplace, topped by a master bedroom that hovers over the garden like some kind of elegant treehouse.

Intermix says the cloth comes from a fabric mill in New York's garment district, which is purportedly the world's sole purveyor of ecclesiastic materials. The same mill weaves religious tapestries, braids and sashes used by the Vatican. Because of Intermix's longstanding relationship with the mill (which also produces custom fabrics for retailers), the store was allowed to purchase 50 yards of material cut from the borders of the Trinity pattern, since the body of the fabric pictures crosses and other religious symbols that are off limits to the public.

us,McHistory,"John Delano, the harried narrator of Tom Piazza's first novel, MY COLD WAR (ReganBooks, $24.95), is a professor of cold war studies at a small college in New England. His courses are popular with students but are ridiculed by his colleagues, who dismiss Delano's gimmicky and postmodern obsession with ''surfaces'' as ''History McNuggets.'' When a major New York publisher signs Delano to write a new book on the cold war -- and to participate in an accompanying mini-series for public television -- his career seems to be skyrocketing. But as he struggles with the book, his life begins to fall apart all around him. As Delano sits in his office, blocked and floundering in midlife dread, his faith in himself and the value of his life's work evaporates; his marriage begins to fail and his own personal history, long suppressed, is gaining on him. Praying that he can get a different kind of book out of his family experiences, he travels to Iowa, attempting to reconcile with his younger brother, Chris, whom he broke with eight years earlier, fed up with Chris's drifting from one dubious movement to another. The trip is good for Delano, and it's good for this novel. ''My Cold War'' works better when it's not in academic satire mode; there's a painful, penetrating authenticity in Delano's memories of growing up in a Long Island suburb during the cold war and in his portraits of his relationships with his volatile, loner father and emotionally fragile brother. It's in these sections that Piazza -- whose previous work of fiction was a story collection titled ''Blues and Trouble'' -- reveals the depth of his perceptiveness and talent.

But once you are situated with menus, the haute-cantina vibe fizzles a bit when you are directed to order at the counter. What happens next, you wonder, in anticipation of the blackened catfish tacos, which sound too delicious to be tossed onto a plastic tray alongside a paper napkin. Mercifully, the servers, always pleasant and tolerant of inquiries about its confusing system, take over. Portions are huge and tasty, and the prices could not be much fairer: For $8 you can get char-grilled steak tacos with doughy soft shells tucked inside crisper ones; $4 buys a Texas hot dog or rice and beans for the children, and $7 covers you for any salad option, including a guacamole-dotted Mexican taco, which arrives in a salty, oily, red shell. Vegetarian choices, including tofu ''sour cream,'' abound, and desserts, and specials show up daily.

us,A Religious Experience in Silver and Gold," Shoppers who worship at the altar of fashion may appreciate the influence of an even higher order in a new limited edition Trinity skirt and bustier by Intermix. Made from the same fabric used to make the pope's robes, the metallic brocade contains real gold and silver threads twisted together in an elaborate pattern. Intermix says the cloth comes from a fabric mill in New York's garment district, which is purportedly the world's sole purveyor of ecclesiastic materials. The same mill weaves religious tapestries, braids and sashes used by the Vatican. Because of Intermix's longstanding relationship with the mill (which also produces custom fabrics for retailers), the store was allowed to purchase 50 yards of material cut from the borders of the Trinity pattern, since the body of the fabric pictures crosses and other religious symbols that are off limits to the public. This shakes out to 80 skirts ($265) and 80 matching tops ($255, both at Intermix stores). Heaven only knows how long supplies will last.

Oscar Blandi, a hair stylist who has given the look to Ms. Holmes (as well as other celebrities like Brittany Murphy), said: ''Beach hair is clean with dirty-freshness with imperfection. It's a great contradiction of styles.'' To achieve the high-humidity effect in winter's arid grip, Mr. Blandi suggests dividing freshly washed, dried, product-free hair into sections at the crown. Take each section between your palms and rub vigorously to create a static charge; then, as if peeling cards from a deck, separate the strands of hair all the way to the head. Finish with a spritz of aerosol hair spray to freeze the halo illusion and add a light serum on ends for control.",2003-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Acrylic furniture was a new idea back then, but Rubinstein was nothing if not a confident patron. She knew her own style -- bold -- and stuck with it. But then, the same is true of all the designers featured in this issue. The architect Ron Radziner designed a house for himself and his family that is much more minimalist than the Neutra and Schindler houses his firm is known for restoring, but that perfectly channels their spirit of casual, California indoor-outdoor living. The decorator Thomas Jayne's own New York loft is eccentric rather than opulent, but its educated elegance is the product of someone who knows exactly what he is doing and doesn't need to impress anyone. It's never too late to discover your own style, as William Norwich found out (albeit the hard way). And once you've found it, don't let go.

The OSS division, which is based in Toronto and makes software to provide telephone and Internet service over cable television lines, will now be accounted for as a discontinued operation, Liberate said. Liberate reported that its fiscal first-quarter net loss narrowed $12.6 million, or 12 cents a share, in the period that ended Aug. 31, from $249.3 million, or $2.35 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $1.55 million from $9 million a year earlier. Greg Wood, Liberate's chief financial officer, did not immediately respond to a voice mail message. The company announced last month that it spent $17.9 million on an insurance policy to cover legal expenses related to a restatement of financial results.

Her lawyers argue that the Nassau law is unconstitutionally vague and amounts to excessive punishment. The Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments next Tuesday.

After a temporary tax increase was passed recently, Mr. Silver said, ""I don't think we should be going back to the well again."" This year, over the vetoes of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, the Legislature imposed nearly $2.5 billion in tax increases in the $93 billion spending plan, chiefly through raising the state income tax on higher-earning New Yorkers, rescinding a state sales tax waiver on clothing costing less than $110 and increasing the state sales tax by one-quarter of a percentage point. &#0160;&#0160;(AP) ",2003-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Net income grew to $159.1 million, or 7 cents a share, from $21.3 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. A tax resolution added 2 cents to profit. Sales rose to $1.51 billion from $1.26 billion, EMC said on its Web site. The chief executive, Joseph M. Tucci, has cut costs and demanded more sales of software and services after losses in 2002 and 2001. Dell, which sells the company's gear, produced more than 10 percent of EMC's third-quarter sales, Mr. Tucci said. Revenue grew faster than the cost of sales in the third quarter, and expenses like research and development fell. EMC shares rose 52 cents, to $13.36.",2003-10-17T05:00:00+0000

William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, said the city's one-month job gain was the largest since September 2000. Statewide, the unemployment rate rose to 6.4, from 6.2 percent in August.

Alice was born on October 17, 1912, in Westchester County, New York, to the late Peter and Harriet (Forbes) Jenkins. She was married to Charles S. O'Donnell, who predeceased her by many years. They had no children. Although at the time of her death Alice had no close living relatives, she was blessed with many close friends who will miss her dearly. For over 40 years, Alice worked for Ogilvy & Mather, an advertising agency in New York City, and, at 90 years of age, was a full time employee there until September of this year when she became ill. A very private person, modest and unassuming in her manner, Alice was a woman of diverse accomplishments and interests. She had a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College and a master's in psychology from Columbia University. An avid reader (especially of good mysteries), Alice was a regular visitor to the Mercantile Library. She took great pride in successfully completing the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Alice was also an intrepid traveler and had been to many countries; she spent a lot of time in Greece and the Mediterranean. A favorite winter destination was Peter Island, where she could simply sit under a palm tree with a good book. More recently, as she became less mobile, Alice determinedly set out to see France by barge. Her final such excursion was in June. Alice generously supported many charities over her lifetime, especially The Fresh Air Fund, and devoted much of her time to helping other people.

This judgment is indicative only of our own rather too self-conscious, human limitations. It seems to me that being in a minimally conscious state makes it quite likely that your perception of gender may differ -- no longer is the body at issue, nor are you preoccupied with bodily functions, body image, body awareness.

For close to fifteen years, he shared with us his extensive knowledge of the insurance industry. Before joining Mutual of America, he served as Vice President and General Counsel of TIAA, as well as founder and president of both VALIC and EALIC. In 1961, Mr. Johnson wrote ''Variable Annuities and Variable Life Insurance, Variable Pensions, Investment Annuities, Economic Index Annuities, Separate Accounts: The Most Complete Book Ever Written on Variable Annuities.'' At the time, it was the most comprehensive book written on this subject. In 1967, along with Donald S. Grubbs, Mr. Johnson wrote, ''The Variable Annuity: A New and Exciting Financial Tool.'' Mr. Johnson was a member of the New York Bar Association, a Chartered Life Underwriter, a Fellow of the Life Office Management Association Institute, a Fellow of the Gerontological Society and a past member of the Life Insurance Council. George Johnson was a man of ideas. Through his work on the Long-Range Objectives Committee, he helped plan for the future needs of Mutual of America's clients. To him we owe a great debt of gratitude. His wife Elizabeth and son George E. Johnson, III, preceded him in death. We extend our sincere condolences to his children, Susan Hartdegan, and Robert A.

us,Cosmopolitan," In the town of Eau Claire in northern Wisconsin, where my father lives, there is an old wooden saloon called the Joynt on Water Street, just a short block off the Chippewa River. The Joynt functions to this day as all things to all people in that city. It's an egalitarian space by necessity. There is a satellite college of the University of Wisconsin there, cheek by jowl with the old Uniroyal tire factory and myriad paper processing plants. The Joynt has been by turns, and sometimes all at once, a student hangout, a faculty bar, a cop coop, the town's only gay bar, the beer hall for all the sweaty workers getting off their shifts at the factories nearby, a makeshift canteen for the elderly of the area, the only place in town to see live music, a pickup bar, and a quiet place in the afternoon or early evening to sit in the dentist's chair up front by the plate-glass window and read the paper. Beer has gone up to seventy-five cents a tap, from the quarter it was when I was growing up. That will buy you a choice of Leinenkugel's (locally known as Leinie's), Point Special, Berghoff Dark, and Grain Belt Premium Lager, the outsider from Minnesota.

The focus of the 700-square-foot storefront quickly switched from eyes to ice cream, and Jordan's Homemade Frozen Desserts -- run by Mr. Via and his wife, Lisa -- opened in late July. They are expecting a daughter whom they plan to name Amanda Jordan, but since there was already an Amanda's restaurant on Washington Street, the minimally appointed ice cream shop became Jordan's. Since relocating to New Jersey from Minneapolis three years ago, Mr. Via had his heart set on starting his own business. An intensive workshop at New York's Ice Cream University followed for Mr. Via, a former marketing specialist for Pillsbury and General Mills. Hoboken, with its young, professional demographic, seemed like an ideal spot for Mr. Via to sell premium ice cream. On the premises, Mr. Via produces a rotating selection of flavors. On a recent day, the offerings included 19 standard ice creams, a fat-free vanilla, a sugar-free vanilla, and three sorbets ($2.50 for a small cup, $3.50 large, $4.50 pint, $7.50 quart, $2.50 sugar cone, $3 small waffle cone, $4 large waffle, $4 milkshake). I tried a cup of chocolate peanut butter, which was creamy and delicious. The next time I sampled the peanut butter chocolate chip. (a personal pattern here?) The Vias pride themselves on using fresh ingredients and avoiding artificial flavoring (like real rum in the rum raisin). In the coming months, they plan to add ice cream cakes, coffees and pastries to the menu. Jack Silbert",2003-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,A Distant Shore," England has changed. These days it's difficult to tell who's from around here and who's not. Who belongs and who's a stranger. It's disturbing. It doesn't feel right. Three months ago, in early June, I moved out here to this new development of Stoneleigh. None of the old villagers seem comfortable with the term ""new development."" They simply call Stoneleigh the ""new houses on the hill."" After all, our houses are set on the edge of Weston, a village that is hardly going to give up its name and identity because some developer has seen a way to make a quick buck by throwing up some semi-detached bungalows, slapping a carriage lamp on the front of them and calling them ""Stoneleigh."" If anybody asks me I just say I live in Weston. Everybody does, except one or two who insist on writing their addresses as ""Stoneleigh."" The postman told me that they add ""Weston"" as an afterthought, as though the former civilises the latter. He was annoyed, and he wanted me to know that once upon a time there had been a move to change the name of Weston to Market Weston, but it never caught on. He was keen that I should understand that there was nothing wrong with Weston, and once he started I could hardly get him to stop. That was last week when he had to knock on the door for he had a package that wouldn't fit through the letterbox, and he said that he didn't want to squash it up (""You never know what's in it, do you, love?""). He told me that he had been instructed by head office to scratch out the name ""Stoneleigh"" if it appeared on any envelopes. Should the residents turn out to be persistent offenders, then he was to politely remind them that they lived in Weston. But he told me that he didn't think that he would be able to do this. That actually if they wanted to live in cloud-cuckoo land, then who was he to stop them? He didn't tell this to his boss, of course, because that would have been his job. There and then, on the spot.

The photographer Taryn Simon found and interviewed her subjects by working with the Innocence Project, the legal clinic founded by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld at Cardozo Law School in New York. She provides summaries for each case with its accompanying image -- vividly stylized re-creations of the scene of the arrest or misidentification, portraits with alibi witnesses or vignettes from the newly free lives of the wrongfully convicted. They alone do not tell us much about their subjects -- and that is part of the point. Many of the people portrayed were convicted on the basis of flawed eyewitness testimony, stacked lineups and manipulated photo displays. ''Photography's ability to blur truth and fiction is one of its most compelling qualities,'' Simon writes. The best of the pictures have an ambiguous, dreamlike quality. For example, Walter Snyder, seen from the front, seems furious, but his profile, reflected in the mirrored wall behind him, is tragically sad.

In 1984, Prime acquired the Howard Johnson hotel company and in 1989 it acquired the Ramada Inn chain. Mr. Simon was Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of the Company from 1969 through his retirement in 1992. Not one to stay away from deal making or the hotel industry for too long, Mr. Simon started another hotel venture in Florida in 1997 with close friend and partner Patrick Guarini. They currently have a group of 5 hotels throughout South Florida. Mr. Simon was a private person who never took glory in the many successes he achieved throughout his career.

In a 6-0 decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed two lower court decisions supporting the change. In the decision, Chief Judge Judith Kaye acknowledged that the new deadline might hurt some claimants, but concluded that the superintendent had the authority to make such a change.

That was welcome news for a company battling fierce competition in the telecom sector. As phone companies increasingly fight over customers looking for lower rates and more options, BellSouth has focused on its bundled packages of services that offer a one-stop communications shop. The strategy spurred the strong results. BellSouth, which is based in Atlanta, said it earned $936 million, or 51 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $640 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, which included hefty charges related to job and service cuts. Excluding one-time items -- charges related to asset impairment and foreign-currency transaction losses -- BellSouth said it earned $980 million, or 53 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were expecting earnings of 50 cents a share excluding one-time items. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $5.72 billion from $5.43 billion in the year-earlier period.

He cited economic harm from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome last spring and a public desire for faster growth after six years of a mostly stagnant economy since Britain returned the territory to China in 1997. Mr. Tang hinted that low interest rates might tempt the government to issue bonds to pay some of its deficit, even though Hong Kong still had large reserves left from surpluses under British rule. The International Monetary Fund's deputy director for research, David Robinson, said the timing of a balanced budget was less important than a credible strategy for reducing deficits. Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, warned that the government had a narrow tax base that made it vulnerable to economic cycles, but said that it wanted to learn more about Mr. Tang's plans before commenting.

The economics and labor ministry cut its forecast for growth in 2003 to zero, from an earlier projection of 0.75 percent. It also trimmed its expectations of growth in 2004 to a range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent, down from 2 percent. While no growth would be Germany's weakest performance over a full year since 1993, the economics and labor minister, Wolfgang Clement, above, said it would be a ''black zero,'' meaning the economy was not in danger of finishing the year in the red.

And forming a huge L overhanging this patch of blue stands the Hotel des Mille-Collines, with its habitual clientele of international experts and aid workers, middle-class Rwandans, screwed-up or melancholy expatriates of various origins, and prostitutes. All around the pool and hotel in lascivious disorder lies the part of the city that matters, that makes the decisions, that steals, kills, and lives very nicely, thank you. The French Cultural Centre, the UNICEF offices, the Ministry of Information, the embassies, the president's palace (recognizable by the tanks on guard), the crafts shops popular with departing visitors where one can unload surplus black market currency, the radio station, the World Bank offices, the archbishop's palace. Encircling this artificial paradise are the obligatory symbols of decolonization: Constitution Square, Development Avenue, Boulevard of the Republic, Justice Avenue, and an ugly, modern cathedral. Farther down, almost in the underbelly of the city, stands the red brick mass of the Church of the Holy Family, disgorging the poor in their Sunday best into crooked mud lanes bordered by houses made of the same clay. Small red houses - just far enough away from the swimming pool not to offend the nostrils of the important - filled with shouting, happy children, with men and women dying of AIDS and malaria, thousands of small households that know nothing of the pool around which others plan their lives and, more importantly, their predictable deaths.

This radical change in family structure, more so than the declining price of corn feed, prompted the extraordinary growth of the McDonald's and Burger Kings. Furthermore, by 1975, sales of microwave ovens exceeded those of gas ovens for the first time.

It is 1937 and the nameless players are a 16-year-old Manchurian girl and a 24-year-old Japanese officer garrisoned in her town. As they take turns in brief first-person chapters, their stories circle each other slowly, warily. And like the black and white stones on the board, life for each is starkly defined. He is devoted to the art of war, the honor and sublime hatred of battle. She has given herself to a student revolutionary whose betrayal hurls her into adolescent despair. When the officer, incognito, meets the girl across a go table in the town square, the strategies of the game reveal each to the other, a nearly wordless communion that mounts to an apocalyptic climax. Shan, who was born in Beijing in 1972 but now lives in France, writes spare prose adorned with images that linger in the mind -- the girl's loneliness is ''like a bolt of crimson silk stowed in the bottom of a wooden chest.'' But in this elegant translation from the French by Adriana Hunter, the dreamlike, mesmerizing alternation of voices stands in uneasy contrast to the operatic violence of the plot. Janice P.

I was surprised, however, to learn that the fine for illegal parking in a handicapped space exceeds the penalty for driving while talking on a cellphone. The law against using hand-held cellphones while driving, already compromised by permitting hands-free phones in vehicles, continues to be disregarded by an alarming number of drivers in all locations from parking lots to heavily trafficked highways. It is obvious that sufficient enforcement personnel are unavailable to deal with all of those who are willing to chance their safety and that of others. Unfortunately, the use of volunteers to identify these scofflaws is impractical. It would seem that the next logical step in gaining greater compliance with the cellphone use laws would be to increase fines to a realistic level commensurate with effecting deterrence. Surely, the penalty for flagrantly jeopardizing the lives and safety of others should be greater than that imposed on those who, in essence, cause inconvenience to a special, albeit limited segment of the population.",2003-10-26T05:00:00+0000

Today a Moscow court is to hear her suit for restoration of her job and back pay. Ms. Volochkova, 27, who stands 5 feet 6 inches tall and says she weighs 109 pounds, told the Itar-Tass news agency, ''Unfortunately I was compelled to take this step, and I intend to restore my rights and those of other artists through the court.'' Russia's labor minister, Alexander Pochinok, has also said the dismissal violated labor laws and urged the Bolshoi to take Ms. Volochkova back. Although the Bolshoi initially refused, Anatoly Iksanov, its director, has now told Itar-Tass that it is ''highly likely'' that the theater will have to welcome the ballerina back after the court hearing. Meanwhile, she has thrown her support behind the parliamentary election campaign of Unity, the party that backs President Vladimir V. Putin. She has also been rehearsing for ''Stairway to Heaven,'' a series of solo performances at the Kremlin Palace concert hall that is being advertised on billboards and banners around Moscow.

That these terrorists, mostly Sunni Muslims from the so-called Sunni Triangle northwest of Baghdad, retain a stubborn fealty to the former dictator seems to puzzle the coalition leadership. But it should not: their loyalty is rooted in part in centuries-old tribal kinship and religious identity. Only by understanding these ties and then using them to its advantage will the coalition authority reduce the resistance.",2003-10-28T05:00:00+0000

The study, which was conducted by I.B.M. and Watchfire, found that 66 percent of the financial institutions examined had one or more Web forms that collect personal data, like credit card information, that is not encrypted before it is sent across the Internet. Most companies, the study found, use encryption that does not meet the government's security guidelines. The office of the comptroller of the currency states that when collecting consumer information, companies should use ''security technology that, at a minimum, is equivalent to 128-bit encryption.'' According to the study, 91 percent of the companies supported lower levels of encryption, or less than the 128-bit level. The study was released by I.B.M. and Watchfire, a software maker, as they introduced an online service that monitors and reports privacy shortcomings in corporate Web sites.

He had a full and varied life, which he shared with his beloved wife of 64 years, Jane Chadbourne Scott. He was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1908, the son of George C. Scott Sr., President of the U.S. Steel Corporation, and Ruth Spencer Scott whose father was Corwin Spencer, President of the Saint Louis World's Fair Committee. George Scott was one of three children. His two brothers, Corwin and David, predeceased him. He graduated from The Principia Upper School in Saint Louis in 1927 and attended Principia College. George Scott started work at Citibank (then The National City Bank of New York) in 1929 as a messenger in the Foreign Tellers Department. He ws promoted to the Correspondent Desk and then to the Comptroller's department where he worked as an auditor. He was assigned to the Foreign Inspection Staff where he audited the foreign branches of Citibank for five years. In 1935 he married Jane Chadbourne whom he had known since childhood. He was then assigned to a domestic district to develop business for the bank. The Domestic Loan Desk was his next assignment and then he moved to cover the Southwest. He was in Dallas when he heard the news of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and immediately returned to enlist. He was made an officer in the Navy and, having a private pilot's license, was assigned to Squadron 7, an OS2U Sea Plane Operation based in Pensacola.

With the end of World War II, he returned to Citibank and was promoted to Assistant Vice President, then Vice President heading the Southwestern District. After a few years he took charge of all activities west of the Mississippi River. Later he transferred to the Overseas Division and handled all foreign credit activities. Under George Moore, Chairman of Citibank, he was asked to assume the responsibilities of Credit Policy Chairmanship. When asked why-George Moore replied that he did not want a ''yes'' man and that George Scott was the only person he knew who would tell him if he were wrong. When George Moore retired, Walter Wriston became Chief Executive Officer promoting George Scott to Vice Chairman and asking him to continue supervising all Citibank credit activity. During his years in Credit Policy, he and his wife visited most of the countries where the bank had activities. Some years after George Scott's retirement, Walter Wriston was questioned as to how Citibank had gotten into their current bad loan situation. His reply was that George Scott was no longer there. George Scott served on the Board of Directors of Citibank, N.A., Dresser Industries in Dallas, and an American subsidiary of Siemens in Munich, Germany. He was Chairman of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service founded to help people with financial difficulties. In addition to his business life, George Scott had numerous interests. He flew his own single engine plane holding both instrument and water ratings. He owned a variety of sailboats during his lifetime and greatly enjoyed sailing and cruising. He was a past president of the Seabright Lawn and Tennis Club, a current member of the Seabright Beach Club, and a past Director and current member of the Rumson Country Club where he recently won the Club Senior golf championship. He delighted in playing the piano and the concertina. He was a member of both the First Church of Christ Scientist in Boston, MA and its local branch in Keyport, NJ. Two nieces, Nancy Mills Crabbe and Nancy Scott Cameron, four grandnieces, two grandnephews, nine great grandnieces, and one great grandnephew survive him. He was a consummate gentleman, a role model for many, and will be deeply missed. Funeral services are private and at the convenience of the family.

Some Democrats have questioned the independence of officially quasi-independent public authorities under Gov. George E. Pataki. In 1999, Mr. D'Amato, the former United States senator and mentor of Mr. Pataki, working as a corporate consultant, telephoned the chairman of the M.T.A. on behalf of a client. Mr. D'Amato was paid $100,000 for the call and a later ''success fee'' of $400,000, Mr. Brodsky said. The phone call was disclosed in hearings conducted in May by Mr. Brodsky, who requested the investigation. Al Baker (NYT)",2003-10-31T05:00:00+0000

Pataki has been backing for a federal judgeship in Brooklyn. By voice vote, the panel agreed to send the nomination of Dora Irizarry, who ran unsuccessfully against Eliot Spitzer for state attorney general, to the full Senate. The panel approved Judge Irizarry's nomination to a judgeship in the Eastern District of New York despite allegations that she screamed at lawyers during her years as a trial judge. Administration officials said that of the 200 people President Bush has nominated to become federal judges, the American Bar Association rated only three as unqualified, and that Judge Irizarry was one of them. President Bush nominated her at Mr. Pataki's urging, which was widely viewed as a reward for running on the Republican ticket when the governor was courting Hispanic voters.

The documents are Fire and Police Department records that federal investigators requested a year ago as part of an inquiry by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which wants to review police 911 tapes as well as transcripts of interviews with hundreds of surviving firefighters so that it can understand how the city handled the trade center evacuation.

When there was optimism about their political future, he said, support for violence plummeted, and Palestinian security services fought radicals.
