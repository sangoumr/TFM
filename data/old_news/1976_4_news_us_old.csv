Field marshals and guardsmen, dressed in scarlet, gold and black, marched in solemn procession at Windsor Castle for Lord Montgomery's funeral. Lord Montogmery died a week ago at the age of 88. Veterans of Alamein, where Montgomery and a battered army began the North African thrust that turned the tide of the war 33 years ago, stood at curbside. The police estimated that 4,000 bystanders joined 1,000 specially picked soldiers along the funeral route. Nineteen cannon shots, a field marshal's due, echoed through the town, its flags at halfstaff, while muffled drums rolled and six black horses drew a gun carriage bearing Montgomery's flagdraped coffin, his familiar black beret resting on top. Mourners included Prince Philip, the Duke of _Edinburgh, who was representing his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, and representatives of dozens of nations. Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr. Supreme NATO commander, represented the United States. The Soviet Union, which snubbed the victory parade in London 30 years ago, sent one of its war heroes, Air Minister Sergei Rudenko. Five British field marshals were honorary pallbearers. The funeral took p/ace at the 500yearold St. George's Chapel, the place of worship and ceremony for the Order of the Garter, an exclusive band of royally appointed knights to which Montgomery belonged. The service, which was televised worldwide, ended with a bugle call and Lord Montgomery's coffin was driven to a simple burial under an ancient yew tree near his country home in Hampshire.",1976-04-02T05:00:00+0000

She is a self-reliant woman, not given to sudden enthusiasms or rash decisions. She has adjusted to circumstances over which she has no control and though she is not wildly happy, things could be worse. She might not have any lover at all, for example, instead of Joska, played by Laszlo Szabo, who once a week, is amusing and kind and attentive, and who has never once led her to think he would leave his wife and children for her.""Adoption,"" which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 6 P.M. and Sunday at 8:30 P.M., is the measured, unsentimental story of what happens to Kata as she realizes there may be more to life than adjusting to outside circumstances. Kata decides she wants a baby and she does something about it.The Hungarian film, directed by Marta Meszaros, is the first of 12 that will be shown at the museum between now and April 13 in the annual New Directors / New Films series, a project jointly sponsored by the museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.""Adoption"" is very much a woman's movie. Though its title has specific reference to Kata's actions after her lover refuses to give her a baby, the film has even more to do with surrogate relationships, particularly with the friendship that develops between Kata and a teen-age girl (Gyongyver Vigh) who has been put into a state home by her family. It is also about women without men (or with men who don't quite measure up) in a world still dominated by men.The style is introspective, or, at least, as introspective as it is possible to be in a movie that does not attempt to crash through to the subconscious. In the center of the screen most of the time, in the close-ups favored by the director, is the fine, angular, expressive face of Miss Berek, who may remind you of Annie Giradot minus the mannerisms Miss Giradot has been using lately.""Adoption,"" which is Miss Meszaros's fifth feature, never explodes with the unexpected insights that separate great films from good ones. It takes no exciting chances. Rather, it records the details of one woman's life with the kind of deliberate care and intelligence that one can recognize without being especially moved.",1976-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Lipstick':Glamorous Film About Raped Model Arrives,"""Lipstick"" is what might be described as a glamour film about rape. Its victim is a beautiful, hugely successful photographers' model, played by Margaux Hemingway, in real life a beautiful, hugely successful photographers' model who also happens to be Ernest's granddaughter.The rapist (Chris Sarandon) is a young man who composes avant-garde music and worships the works of another avant-garde composer, identified in the film as Sean Gage. Sean Gage? I'm sure that's what he says, though why ""Lipstick"" hesitates to drop the name of John Cage, I've no idea.It's certainly not because ""Lipstick"" is too discreet. It is, however, anti-intellectual in the ways that B movies always have been. The message of ""Lipstick,"" if I read it right, is less about the physical and legal vulnerability of women than about the sexual hang-ups of eccentric young men who compose music with synthesizers and laser beams. The movie's subliminal message: Bring back the clavichord.""Lipstick,"" which opened yesterday at the Loews State 2 and Loews Cine Theaters, was written by David Rayfiel and directed by Lamont Johnson (""The Groundstar Conspiracy,"" ""The Last American Hero""), a shrewd, knowledgeable but not very interesting director, who is touted for his fearless way with controversial subjects. ""Lipstick"" is occasionally violent and crude, and about as controversial as the March of Dimes.The film appears to take rape seriously, though  the kind of rape in which the victim, who hasn't been permanently injured, must overcome the prejudices of a society that always suspects that such a rape victim got what she asked for. The only time ""Lipstick"" is believable is during the trial sequence when Anne Bancroft, appearing as the ferociously determined lawyer for the victim, presents the case not only for Miss Hemingway, but also for all women. It's almost like a training film, but it is effective.For a little while, anyway. ""Lipstick's"" heart belongs to an earlier, simpler time. It's no accident, I think, that the heroine is presented as a good Roman Catholic with a priest for a brother. We thus know she is a good girl. Neither is it an accident that the rapist is a composer of what the movie clearly believes to be crackpot music, and that the climactic sequencea second, even more vicious rape  occurs in a modern glass and steel building that, in a film like this, could be the architectural equivalent to ""Sean Gage"" music.Mr. Johnson treats Miss Hemingway very gingerly. She's not much of an actress yet, and there are times he seems to be protecting her by cutting away to other actors, when one would expect the camera to stay on her. Mr. Sarandon, who won an Oscar nomination for his small but effective role in ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" does as well as can be expected with the role of the rapist.The revelation of ""Lipstick"" is another Hemingway, first name Mariel, Margaux's 14-year-old sister, who plays her sister in the film. As the chief witness to the events within the movie, and its ultimate victim, she gives an immensely moving, utterly unaffected performance that shows up everything else as a calculated swindle.",1976-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Miller's family roots run deep in Columbus history, and moving the company was unthinkable. So he began, slowly, to remake the town from a tired, decaying prairie place into the sort of city he saw as an appropriate home for Cummins. His method was architecture. He announced in 1954 that the Cummins Engine Foundation would pay the architect's fees for any public building in town designed by an architect of national note.

I am Mahler, Leonard Bernstein was once quoted as saying and his close identification with the Austrian composer typifies the kind of personal impact his music makes on late 20thcentury audiences When performed by a thoroughly involved interketer.

Albemarle County, in which Charlottesville lies, was settled by folk who left the security of Virginia's eastern shore in the 18th century. Their enterprising spirit was epitomized in the 19th century by native son Meriwether Lewis, Jefferson's personal secretary, who undertook with William Clark to find the Northwest Passage. The early tobacco plantations around Charlottesville vanished long ago, but the region's rural lifestyle remains. Even today the landscape is one of rustic beauty, of cattle and horse f arms, of stately mansions, of historic markers and of small country stores.

Life proliferates and chokes: Too many mosquitoes and snakes. Turn your back on your garden for a minute, and vegetable sex has buried it under fronds and creepers. ""Guerra Conjugal"" is a Brazilian film, set in the pastel and languid town of Curitiba, that sees in the relations between men and women the virulence of a poisoned eclair. It is being shown as part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors series.Three stories intercut with one another. The first is about a middleaged lawyer who seduces everyone in sight. Finally, in horror and helplessness, he is seduced by an old schoolmate. Don Juan as the repressed homosexual.The second is about a young man who finds his satisfaction in progressively older women. The last is a horrendous crone of at least 80. Don Juan as the mother-fixated infant.If the first two episodes dispose of eroticism, the third lays out marital love. An aged couple quarrel more and more violently. He accuses her of thinking of other men; she tells him he disgusts her. Dying, he asks his son to see to it that the wife doesn't kiss his dead face. He dies; she grows miraculously younger.""Guerra"" is Tropical Gothic: It makes Southern Gothic look like cream of wheat. In its violent disgust for the human animalin this case the human sexual animalit occasionally reaches the inspired dementia of a Buuel. There are some brilliantly harsh and funny episodes.Mostly, though, its meansuneven acting, uncertain direction and overblown writingfall a long way short of its intentions. If the eclair is half-baked, there's not much use poisoning it.Good things, the saying goes, come in small packages. And the small packages that are the films of Eli Noyes Jr, are crammed with wit, beauty, inventiveness and a keen sensitivity to the lunacy and sadness of the human condition.Eleven of these filmssome animated, some live action, one a mixture of the two; some in color, some in black and whiteare being shown this weekend and next at the Film Forum in an 82-minute parade that should captivate a great many children, delight adults and disabuse anyone of the notion that when it comes to animation, Walt Disney and his disciples had the last word.Mr. Noyes is the sort of artist who can take a run through the alphabet with pen and ink in six minutes, stirring up comparisons with Maurice Sendak and Saul Steinberg with his drawing and leaving ""Sesame Street"" and Richard Scarry in his wake with his humor.In 8 minutes he can speak volumes about evolution, through  appropriately  a lump of clay transformed with seeming magic into all manner of life. In 60 seconds he can run through a lexicon of barks from a creative kennel full of dogs or make wild sport of the world's peanut-butter-and-jelly addicts. Given a country music background and a few grains of sand, he produces marvelous choreography.In live action, he transmits a crafty dog's-eye view of singles' life in New York and takes a bold excursion into one of the city's great conflicts  the war against the roach. His most eye-catching clay animation is reserved for ""The Fable of He and She,"" an 11-minute film that suffers, however, from a heavyhanded story about sexual roles that Mr. Noyes did not compose.His own formidable powers of storytelling and political commentary are strikingly displayed in ""The Dot,"" a 30-minute film that conjures up an eerie, Orwellian world and combines live action and animation to make a statement against repression.Mr. Noyes is a filmmaker of impressive accomplishment, and his work deserves to be seen.",1976-04-09T05:00:00+0000

A much greater problem is that the political message that is only one of the threads in the first part thickens into hawser dimensions, strangling the film and the audience along with it.Translated as ""The Travelling Players,"" Thiassos is a bloated, spoiled masterpiece. But it is, at the same time, the undoubted high point of the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors series, being shown at the museum today and Wednesday. So far, this year's series has given us a number of fairly dim talents, and sometimes considerably less than that.Theodor Angelopoulos, whose third film this is, possesses enormous talent; large enough to show clearly through his monstrous lack of restraint and, often, to overcome it. Since restraint is easier to acquire than genius, there is a basis for hoping that we are seeing the work of someone who is destined to become a truly great film maker.""Thiassos"" attempts to tell the story of modern Greece through the wanderings of a band of actors, an unskilled provincial group that sings and dances in front of village theaters to lure audiences inside for a performance of a rough shepherd's play.The action begins in 1939, goes through World War II and the civil war and ends in 1952. Using flashbacks, flash-forwards and narrated recollections, it manages to suggest a broader time span from the 1920's up to the time of the colonels' coup.The film's structure is even more complex than its time frame. It is the story of political developments in Greece as they affect the villages visited by the troupe: the right-wing prewar Metaxas dictatorship, the national unity of right and left during the brief fight against the Axis, the civil war andas the film sees itthe victory of reaction over popular forces.At the same time it is the story of the troupe itself; the decimation of the company under the stress of personal and political passion. Mr. Angelopoulos manages to blend both thingsthe jealousies and betrayals within the company and the political divisions of right and leftinto a retelling of the Electra tragedy.There is no space to begin to enumerate the many marvelous things that are accomplished. Over such a sprawling arrangement for example, Mr. Angelopoulos manages a fair unity of mood by shooting virtually the whole film in the cold, milky overcast of Greek winter.He has some prodigious images. The wartime famine is declared in a tiny scene. A solitary chicken is shown on a snow-covered slope; the members of the troupe advance upon it in black, crablike profile. He has filmed hunger.Elektra, the young actress, is accosted by a black-shirted member of a pro-Metaxas gang. She takes him to her room and tells him to strip. He does, completely. He takes off his first garments in leering anticipation; then, beneath her contemptuous gaze his movements become less certain. Finally, his total nakedness coincides with total humiliation as she turns and walks out. It is a scene of merciless justness.There are many scenes of equal brilliance and force. The acting and camera work are flawless. Mr. Agelopoulos takes many risks. He holds camera or characters still for minutes on end; he has scenes that consist of one character addressing the camera at length. Usually these things work, in surprising ways.But the film begins to flag in the middle. In part, the deliberate pace becomes excessive. Many of the slow gestures begin to seem like affectations.Furthermore, the message begins to shed its complexity and become simply a tract praising the Communist forces who lost the civil war and attacking and caricaturing the conservative victors and their British and American allies.The execessive politicization in a work of normal dimensions and equal ???talent???t would simply be a flaw. Here it is immensely magnified. The discoveries of the first two hours turn into a relentless pounding during the last two.",1976-04-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Hitchcock's 'Family Plot' Bubbles Over,"Not since ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Trouble With Harry"" has Alfred Hitchcock been in such benign good humor as he is in ""Family Plot,"" the old master's 56th feature since he began directing films in 1922.""Family Plot,"" which opened at theaters all over town yesterday, is a witty, relaxed lark. It's a movie to raise your spirits even as it dabbles in phony ones, especially those called forth by Blanche (Barbara Harris), a sweet, pretty, totally fraudulent Los Angeles medium, who nearly wrecks her vocal cords when possessed by a control whose voice sounds like Sidney Greenstreet's.But ""Family Plot"" isn't about anything as esoteric as spiritualism and its sometimes wayward votaries. It's about good old-fashioned greed, or, how to work very, very hard in order to make your fortune illegally. It's one of the many invigorating ironies of ""Family Plot"" that its con people are so obsessed by their criminal pursuits they never realize the easier way would probably be the lawful one.Then, of course, there would be no plot, and a high regard for plot is one of the distinguishing joys of both Hitchcock and this new film.Ernest Lehman's screenplay, based on a novel by Victor Canning, is about the efforts of Blanche and her boyfriend, Lumley (Bruce Dern), a good-natured lug who works as a cab driver but thinks he'd like to be an actor, to track down the missing heir to a huge West Coast fortune. If Blanche's spirits help her to find the fellow, she's been promised $10,000 by the heir's ancient aunt (Cathleen Nesbitt). Although $10,000 isn't exactly beyond our wildest dreams, to Blanche and Lumley it represents a lot of palms that won't have to be read.The object of their man-hunt, though they don't know it for a long time, is a wealthy Los Angeles jeweler named Adamson (William Devane) who, with his girlfriend. Fran (Karen Black), has a passion for oversize diamonds he cannot afford.To satisfy their passion, Adamson and Fran have perfected the art of kidnapping for ransoms of king-size jewels. When we first meet them, they are just completing the successful abduction of a fabulously rich, seemingly Greek international financier and, before the movie is over, they've had equally good luck with the abduction of a bishop, whom they snatch from the altar of his cathedral during mass.Hitchcock cross-cuts between the two couples in the course of the film to build a kind of menace-free but very real suspense. Fran and Adamson, who live in a very chic San Francisco town house (though the rest of the movie appears to be set in Los Angeles), are naturally worried when they learn they are being pursued by an eccentric fortuneteller and her taxi driver lover, and they take steps to eliminate the investigators.It's not revealing too much, I think, to report that these steps are never completely successful. Blanche and Lumley, merged, make a single bird-brain, but one whom heaven protects and fortune smiles on.As performed by Miss Harris and Mr. Dern, they are two of the most appealing would-be rascals that Hitchcock has even given us. For that matter so are Adamson and Fran (she has no last name, which leaves her matrimonial state in Old World, gentlemanly doubt). Though Adamson is portrayed as being perfectly willing to murder, when cornered, he never succeeds, and Fran is the kind of kidnapper who prepares gourmet meals for her involuntary guests.The four are extremely good company, like Hitchcock himself when, in an expansive, genial, storytelling mood, even his digressions have digressions, but always to the point of some higher entertainment truth.Hitchcock aficionados may well miss signs of the director's often overanalyzed pessimism. ""Family Plot"" is certainly Hitchcock's most cheerful film in a long time, but it's hardly innocent. One of the things that figure prominently in the plot, though it happens long before the film starts, is the story of a young man who, finding his stepparents boring, pours gasoline all over the house and incinerates the offending pair.It's a small thing, perhaps, but it continues the master's franchise on the macabre.",1976-04-10T05:00:00+0000

The festival began on Friday and will continue through next weekend at the Fair Grounds Race Track, 1751 Gentilly Boulevard, where tents are pitched, stages mounted and booths arranged to accommodate the bands, the food and the handcrafts in a setting of old live oaks, palm trees, lagoons and fountains. On the menu will be blues, rhythm and blues, bluegrass, folk ragtime, Cajun and country music and dishes like gumbo, crawfish pie and red beans and rice. There also will be a gospel tent and jazz tent, and tamales and stuffed pepper. The festival will run from 11 A.M. to sundown. During the evenings concerts will be held around townaboard boats in the Mississippi River, at the Royal Sonesta Hotel and elsewhere. The concerts will feature such performers as Allen Toussaint, Professor Longhair, Dave Bartholomew and Clarence Gatemouth Brown.

There's a $2 cover charge on weekends for the music, which gets better later in the evening. The crowd is young, a comfortable mix of black and white. Other places, far from the tourist beat, in the Carrollton section, are the Maple Leaf Club, 8316 Oak Street, and Jed's University Inn, 8301 Oak Street. At Preservation Hall, 726 St. Peter Street, the musicians are getting older but they still sound good. You sit on benches or on the floor.

Studies tended to stress differences, specifically those that appeared to document the backwardness.

My doubts had nothing to do with my fondness for Wallace: his rare odd pieces of knowledge, often remarkable in their practicality, often wacky in their mysticism, interested me; he was serious about the state of America, open about his fears for the future, but there was no doubt that the powerful hand of Roosevelt had held tight rein over the conflicts in Wallace's nature and the strange digressions of his mind.",1976-04-11T05:00:00+0000

It's about gallantry under stress, especially that of Steely Brown (W. Geoffrey King), a young teen-ager whose father, a Vietnam vet with a lot of pride and nowhere to put it, walks out on Steely's hard-pressed mother, the sort of woman who wants to survive by making as few waves as possible.In one exceedingly long night, Steely roams the streets of Harlem trying to scrape together the $27 he owes his mother and recallingin flashbacksthe events that led up to his father's disappearance. ""The Long Night"" gets high marks for the performance of young Mr. King, who has a winning, unaffected screen presence, and for its good thoughts about black identity and aspirations. As moviemaking it is mechanical and unexciting in almost every respect.The film is being shown at the museum today at 6 P.M. and again Tuesday at 8:30 P.M. It will be released commercially later this year by Mahler Films.Being shown at the museum today at 8:30 P.M. is another black film, this one about the exploitation of a poor, hard-working Senegalese farmer by the Marabouts, religious teachers who turn their pupils into professional beggars."" The film, ""Njangaan,"" directed by Mahama Johnson Traore, is of primary interest as a report on life from one emerging African nation. It will be shown again Tuesday at 6 P.M., the last day of the New Directors/New Films series sponsored by the museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.The conclusion of this year's New DirectorsNew Films programthe fifth in the series sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art and the Lincoln Center Film Society  prompts some thoughts about the problems that arise when institutions commit themselves to such ""annual"" events. Of the 11 films in this year's program (the print of the 12th scheduled film never arrived), only three deserved the attention this sort of festival confers. Those three were the Greek ""O Thiassos,"" the French ""Vronique"" and the Hungarian ""Adoption.""The rest of the films looked suspiciously like program fillers, choices made by the festival's sponsors to keep their annual event going even in a year when they either couldn't obtain new films of remarkable value or couldn't find any worth particular attention.The New Directors  New Films program last year presented at least three highly original works, and all the rest of the films, except two, were of special interest. The mediocrity of most of this year's selections had a way of diminishing the value of even the several worthy films. Conclusion: There may be some years when the festival sponsors should call the whole thing off.",1976-04-11T05:00:00+0000

It isn't that the idea isn't a reasonable updating and extension of the movies' long and occasionally hilarious exploration of the comedic potential of Italian mores.It's simply that ""Virility"" expends too much time reaching the point where it poses the problem and not enough inventiveness in exploiting the possible answers. Only one scene  of the father, Don Vito, disguised as his son, Roberto, attempting a rape while announcing his assumed identity  begins to hint at what might have been.The movie can boast sun-washed scenery that is escapist entertainment in itself; the attractions of Agostina Belli as Don Vito's young second wife, and a general air of polish that did not, unfortunately, spread far enough to impart the sparkle of inspiration to the script.",1976-04-12T05:00:00+0000

The film's climax is the bloody clash between the two stories, a climax that should be tragic but is simply grotesque and unbelievable.When the main action of a movie is so weak and the background is so strong, a peculiar focus develops. There is a beguilement to ""Sailor,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theaterthat of sitting through a movie in a state of irascible unconvincedness while being more than half seduced.""Sailor"" is a radical transplant of a short story by the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, a writer who gathered around himself a kind of heroic cult and who killed himself to protest the softness of the times, Lewis John Carlino moved it from Yokohama to Dartmouth, a Devon port.With the inspired work of his director of photography, Douglas Slocombe, the transposition is an atmospheric triumph. The sweet but somber English coast, its lowering skies and transforming bursts of sunshine, the clean presence of the sea, the white seaside house where the widowed mother lives and into which the sailor comesall these develop a powerful emotional background for their relationship.It is a relationship that manages to be romantic and erotic. Sarah Miles is spectacular; she makes sensual yearning convincing both in itself and as standing for the whole range of human want. Kris Kristofferson, as the American sailor who gives up the sea to marry her, looks good but doesn't convey much more than puzzled weakness.But then there is the main story. The widow's 13-year old son, Jonathan, is one of a clique of six boys led by a precocious, mad towhead who has tailored the cult of the superman down into short pants. The boys sit out beside the sea while the chief lectures them on the merciless nobility of the amoeba. They draw up bills of accusation against adults. They sentence a cat to death for being old and fat; they drug it and dissect it alive. Jonathan is ambiguous about his mother's sailor, but the chief concludes that by leaving the sea the sailor has become like the fat cat and deserves the same fate. So the boys go to work on it.Mishima's implacable mouse-gang had a certain abstract grandness. These round-faced English boys smoking cigars and spouting phrases too large for their mouths simply looked silly. Part of the trouble is the writing; Mishima transposed by Mr. Carlino is not capable, as William Golding or Richard Hughes are, of projecting the local English boy into a primeval childhood.Furthermore, Mr. Carlino, for all his skill with the adults and the atmosphere, seems to have no idea how to direct children. Their murderous games never convey horror; they get no further than embarrassment.",1976-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,'River Niger' a Screen Disappointment,"""The River Niger"" is the screen version of Joseph A. Walker's award-winning Negro Ensemble Company play that opened off Broadway in 1972 and later went on to have a successful run on Broadway. Now it's virtually an object lesson in how not to make a movie out of a theater piece.Among other things one should not do is to open up the play to take advantage of the camera's mobility. The people who made ""The River Niger"" have opened it, all right, then they've left it opened upexposed and sort of gapingso that while the actors act, the director directs and the cameraman practices tricks used better by other cameramen, the life of the work has passed on to that great theatrical warehouse in the sky.""The River Niger"" is essentially a black variation of the kind of family play that Arthur Miller once wrote, about fathers and sons and husbands and wives, at a crucial moment of reckoning in their lives. It's about such a moment in the life of Johnny Williams (James Earl Jones), a house painter who writes poetry, his wife, Mattie (Cicely Tyson), and their son Jeff (Glynn Turman), who is coming home after what his parents believe to have been a successful tour of duty as an Air Force navigator.Jeff, however, has not been entirely truthful with his parents. He was cashiered from officer's training school for refusing to play the role of ""Supernigger"" for the white officers. Neither has Mattie been entirely truthful to Jeff and her husband. She's dying of cancer, while Johnny, when he isn't painting a house or writing a poem, is a bit of a lush.There are further problems, especially a subplot involving some old friends of Jeff's who have formed a black revolutionary army of four, one of whom is apparently a police informer.What really wrecks the screen version of ""The River Niger"" is not the on-screen melodrama that once was mostly offstagethough it is pretty dopeybut what appears to be a total lack of cohesive style and cinematic intelligence.I have no idea whether the responsibility is that of Mr. Walker, who adapted his play for the screen, of the director, Krishna Shah, who at times seems to have no idea where his camera should be, or of the editor, Irving Lerner, who may have done the best he could with the footage he was given. Many times two successive shots within a single scene don't match and, worse, characters have a way of leaving a scene without making a conventional exit.The actors have the air of people who've arrived at a party where there's no host. They are on their own. Mr. Jones, one of our finest actors, plays it big, sometimes explosively so, as if he knew things were going on around him that we don't. Miss Tyson carries her nobility around the sets with grim determination, looking like the housewife who says her bulging, 200-pound shopping bag isn't a bit heavy.Perhaps because he doesn't try so hard, Mr. Turman, who was so effective in ""Cooley High,"" is less offensive, though Hilda Haynes, as the grandmother, is little more than a sight gag, and she doesn't try at all.Lou Gossett, as the family friend, a doctor whose roots are in the West Indies, is the one cast member not to be compromised by the mess around him.There are not so many decent black films that the failure of a property like ""The River Niger"" can be accepted as anything but a major disappointment.",1976-04-15T05:00:00+0000

There are now 139 dance companies on the books of the National Endowment for the Arts, and the majority of those are moderndance troupes. A rather smaller percentage of the increase is due to the larger audiences and greater number of performances being given by America's Big Three classic companies, New York City Ballet. American Ballet Theater and City Center Joffrey Ballet, and by foreign touring companies, as is witnessed by the longer season the Hurok organization takes at the Metropolitan Opera House these days.

Though Mr. Passer has a poet's eye for unexpected details and associations, and though he's a risk-taker, his is not a fragile talent. When he makes a mistake, it's a whopper.""Crime and Passion,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is such a film, a grossly disoriented and disorienting shaggy-dog of a movie that seems to have no point, and no point of view, whatever.Based on a James Hadley Chase novel that I haven't read, it's a somewhat black comedy about a neurotic international financial consultant (Omar Sharif), who, when things are going bad for him, has seizures of sexual passion the way other men get sweaty palms. It's also about his loyal assistant, played by Karen Black, whom he marries off to an eccentric German millionaire in a scheme to defraud the bridegroom.The settings include a posh European ski resort and an ancient German castle, while the ghost of a headless knight and an elaborate television monitoring system (in the castle) are among the props.What it's meant to be, I cannot tell. A comedy, melodrama, spoof? There are moments when you might think you are watching one of those stateless exercises that Roman Polanski likes to make occasionally, a movie that seems peculiarly decadent because it has no discernible national identity. This I suspect to be a false reading because everything that Mr. Passer has ever done, including his American-made ""Born to Win"" and ""Law and Disorder,"" is the work of a director of profound sensitivity.

The story will be familiar to many of her readers: in May 1952 she took a dangerous and honorable stand when the House UnAmerican Activities Committee called into question her loyalty to the United States. Hellman's introductory pages are deceptively plain. Her rhetorical directness is much like Thoreau's at the beginning of Walden"": she will simply tell her audience what they have wanted to know.

On the same page are pictures of Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plafh and Anne Sexton; and to all of these the caption reads: Lowell ... was the first American poet to write in the intimate, introspective verse style that has since been dubbed confessional poetry. This new approach to poetry was to prove the undoing of at least one of Lowell's contemporaries and two of his disciples. And in case we have any doubt about who the contemporary is, and who the disciples, the caption makes it plain: John Berryman along with Sylvia Plath . . . and Anne Sexton . . . all harboring unresolved personal torments, wrote poems filled with angst and death wishes that were ultimately fulfilled by suicide. Perhaps unintentionally, this conveys the clear impression that Berryman was a confused character who lost his head as did, more excusably, a couple of much younger poetsbecause of the example of a stronger poet, Lowell, and the critical brouhaha that Lowell's developing career provoked.

I'm referring to those supercharged, badtalking, highly romanticized melodramas about Harlem superstuds, the pimps, the private eyes and the pushers who more or less singlehandedly make whitey's corrupt world safe for black pimping, black privateeyeing and black pushing. By next week I may be eating my hat, hut right now it seems as if more and more films that once would have been categorized as black films are really films for the general market. They are black films that you don't have to be black to respond to favorably, or to find dreary and pretentious. foolish and inept. The most dynamic and entertaining of these new black films is a candidly commercial boxoffice attack called Sparkle, a story about three young women from Harlem and the high price they pay in their climb to the top as the country's most popular singingsister act. It sounds terrible, a sort of retread of Sally, Irene and Mary' transposed to the nevernever land ruled by Barry Gordy and Motown Records. The confusion may well be intentional. The routines performed by the girls in Sparkle, and the new music provided them by Curtis Mayfield, definitely recall the style and effect of The Supremes and, in Lonette McKee, who plays the sister who goes bad, in the way Lana Turner did in a movie like Ziegfeld Girl, it has a leading actress whose beauty, talent and verve recall the extraordinary Diana Ross herself.",1976-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Stay Hungry':Rafelson Film Is About 'New' South,"""Stay Hungry,"" the new film directed by Bob Rafelson (""Five Easy Pieces"" and ""The King of Marvin Gardens""), isn't all bad. It just seems that way when it pretends to be more eccentric than it is and to have more on its mind than it actually does.From time to time there are some awfully good things in it, including its picture of the ""new"" go-getting South, in this case Birmingham, Ala., a place where old-money families live side by side in peace and harmony with the new rich, have the same accents, belong to the same country clubs and sometimes share a rapacity that would please the greediest of 19th-century carpet-baggers.There are also good performances by Jeff Bridges as the oddball scion of landed Birmingham gentry, by Sally Field as his something-less-than blueblood mistress and by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Mr. Universe contestant, a nice, honorable young man who appears to be trapped inside a huge, grotesquely muscled body that has no relation to the conventional head on top of it.The film, which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and the 86th Street East Theaters, was written by Mr. Rafelson and Charles Gaines, who also wrote the original novel and who, according to the program notes, was ready to make any changes in the novel that Mr. Rafelson wanted. ""Frankly,"" Mr. Gaines is reported to have said, ""I just wanted to write a screenplay.""Mr. Rafelson is quoted as saying: ""It was more than just adapting a novel to the screen. It meant restructuring the script, bringing new characters to life. [Mr. Gaines's] creative juices flowed as though it was a new project and the whole experience was exhilarating.""This, I fear, is just what's wrong with ""Stay Hungry."" Mr. Gaines was ready to jettison a lot of his novel, on which, I assume, he had worked long and hard, in order to make a movie, any movie, while Mr. Rafelson ran around keping those old creative juices flowing, instead of turning off the taps once in a while. The experience may have been exhilarating for the two of them, but for us it's all clutter.It is the sort of movie whose vapidity is exposed as soon as the clutter is removed. ""Stay Hungry"" is essentially a story about a rich kid who betrays his class by playing with the poor kids down the block. However, the consequences aren't especially dire, and we never do understand why he does it, or why he is so fascinated by the society of body builders, whose gym is on the downtown Birmingham property coveted by his erstwhile business associates.""Stay Hungry"" has the air of a story repeated by someone who has forgotten the point he set out to make. Which may be one of the dangers in bringing new characters to life and letting creative juices flow at random.The film isn't about very much, but the clutter does keep our attention, such as a sequence in which Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Bridges participate in a real down-home fiddling contest, and another in which Helena Kallianiotes (the manic hitchhiker in ""Five Easy Pieces"") discusses a dentist who keeps his freezer full of doves. R. G. Armstrong creates a wierd, memorable character as the owner of the body builders' gym, an aging body builder himself who sees his potency fading away with his hair.The movie apparently means to respect these body builders, and as long as Mr. Schwarzenegger keeps his clothes on, it does. However, when the camera, at the end of the film, roams over physiques so carefully and lovingly exaggerated they seem about to burst, you suspect the movie of being a freak show that couldn't care less about its freaks.",1976-04-26T05:00:00+0000
