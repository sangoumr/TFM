Now, with the aid of pro bono lawyers and the good will of Frances patent office, hes trying to prevent people from capitalizing on it. I cant trademark it. Its not something that belongs to anyone, Mr. Roncin said in a telephone interview. If its a slogan, it cannot be a brand. Mr. Roncin said that even arms manufacturers had filed requests with the French patent office, hoping to sell weapons with the phrase.

Yet fabulous Anguilla is home to some of the regions toniest resorts, epicurean eateries and breathtaking beaches. It has architecturally striking villas like those at Altamer, named for exotic gemstones. And it is a magnet for celebrities like Kevin Bacon and Jimmy Buffett, a kind of British St. Barts. Without the pretension, though  Anguillan style is a perfect paradox: unfussy chic, barefoot elegance. There are no cruise ships, casinos or high-rise hotels, but there is a thriving local music scene, headed by notable up-and-coming singer-songwriters like Omari Banks and Ruel Richardson, and showcased at Moonsplash, the islands annual reggae festival. And the fabulous factor grows with every season: luxe hotel unveilings include Malliouhana, reopened late last year after a three-year overhaul, along with coming debuts of Zemi Beach Resort and Spa, an opulent 115-room resort, and the Reef by CuisinArt, a boutique hotel powered by a four-acre solar field.",2015-02-04T17:07:40+0000

Mr. Tysons feeling for rubato and over-expressive freedom is balanced by his attentiveness to structure, clarity and inner details. In the 24 Preludes (Op. 28), he brings individual character to each one. Yet Chopins collection of preludes in all the major and minor keys emerges in this reading as a compositional entity. A beautiful recording. (Anthony Tommasini)",2015-02-04T17:35:16+0000

The group strikes a balance between male and female vocals, between futuristic, icy beats and incisive lyrics and even between coasts: It consists of the Los Angeles producers Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda (who also perform together as Nguzunguzu) and their New York counterparts, Fatima Al Qadiri and J-Cush. But in fact, according to Al Qadiri, the groups modus operandi is less deliberate than it seems. Its all on accident, as Al Qadiri says, backstage at a show at Los Angeles Catch One disco. The thing that unites Future Brown is that theres very little agenda. The four D.J.s, who sit at the intersection of music, art and fashion, are linked through their ties to DIS Magazine, a tongue-in-cheek lifestyle webzine that Al Qadiri describes as an incubator for artists working in different mediums.

In the summer of 2012, he controversially hand-copied, for a special commemorative edition, part of the 1942 Talks at the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art, Mao Zedongs statement of orthodoxy on the arts that became the theoretical ur-text of Chinese socialist realism and literary censorship. Yet readers will find little in Frog, Howard Goldblatts fluent translation of Mo Yans 2009 novel about his countrys one-child policy, that validates the society created by the Chinese Communist Party.

It felt like the perfect life goal for all humankind: a feeling of complete belongingness and freedom, unconstrained by societys perceptions of your capabilities, wherever you happen to be  at home or in public. The phrase resonates in three new picture books that highlight issues of race, gender and justice. These stories  about Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Susan B. Anthony, and the Loving v. Virginia case that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage  all have main characters with a steadfast determination to change their lives. They are willing to fight their known hell for an unknown, possibly harsher fate. In each book, the law looms as a character, too, a force that can save lives or kill spirits. And all three books are, in different ways, interracial tales, reminding us that diverse coalitions have always worked together to achieve racial progress.",2015-02-06T16:12:16+0000

A blog is just a stack, an undifferentiated stack of news. You cant tell the trivial from the weighty.

Richard Brookhiser, the award-winning author of biographies of the founding fathers, now adds to that list, venturing past the Revolution into a new era to explore the life of this most written-about American. In many ways, however, this is less a book in which Brookhiser moves forward in time than one that endeavors to pull Lincoln back into the 18th century, claiming him, in the titles words, as fundamentally the founders son. Brookhiser casts Lincoln as what might today be called an originalist, a leader who applied the doctrines of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution in accordance with the founders intentions in order to chart his way through a new national crisis.",2015-02-06T16:12:27+0000

At first glance, we seem to have made great strides toward equality since the civil rights movement. We elected Barack Obama, a black man, president. Twice. We almost universally condemn outright racism. But is it possible that racism (most notably against African-Americans) hasnt receded so much as it has evolved and become more refined? The elegant racist, Ta-Nehisi Coates has written, knows how to injure nonwhite people while never summoning the specter of white guilt. Housing segregation, for instance, is both devastating and hard to detect. And according to the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform, racial minorities are more likely than whites to be arrested, to be convicted and to face stiff sentences. With recent racially charged events like the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York City  as well as the rising plea for more representation of minorities in childrens literature from the We Need Diverse Books movement  I cant think of a more appropriate time for a book about the early years of Malcolm X.",2015-02-06T16:12:30+0000

A cool fog, which sometimes follows a warm winter day, reduced anything beyond my immediate surroundings to haze. I had to stop at one point to admire this trick of the Atlantic  making a thousand-mile horizon vanish  and as I did, five buffleheads appeared as if fashioned just that moment on the limpid seawater. They bobbed like corks, sharply defined in black and white, and I resisted the urge to make them agents with greater intentions.

us,"In a New Book, Never-Before-Seen Photos of John Lennon and Yoko Ono","A little over 30 years ago, the Japanese photographer Kishin Shinoyama walked through Central Park with one of the most famous couples in the world. It was sunset, autumn; they sat on a bench just in front of the pond, bordered by trees, a sliver of New York skyline visible in the distance, including the building where they lived. He asked them to kiss, and he clicked the shutter. Three months later, on Dec. 8, 1980, John Lennon was fatally shot at the entrance to the Dakota, home to him and his wife, Yoko Ono.

It is another kind of crime, said Osbaldo Berber, an adviser to the state prosecutor. The crematorium, Cremaciones Pacfico, above, had been closed for a year, and the bodies, which were found Thursday night, had been embalmed and doused with quicklime to cover the scent of decomposition, officials said. Investigators are gathering local funeral home records to determine the identities of the bodies, the prosecutors office said, and are considering charges of improper burial and abuse of a corpse. The owner of the crematorium, Guillermo Estua Zerdain, is missing, officials said. With no sign of organized crime, the discovery of the corpses appears to be unconnected to the case of 43 missing college students believed to have been rounded up by corrupt police officers and turned over to a drug gang in Guerrero in September.

us,Venezuela: Grocery Chain to Be Seized," Ratcheting up a conflict with retailers of basic goods, President Nicols Maduro on Friday ordered the government takeover of a supermarket chain that officials have accused of hoarding products as part of an economic war against his government. Mr. Maduro did not name the company, which he said had 35 medium-size stores in seven states, but it was clear that he was referring to the Da a Da chain. The stores are generally located in lower-middle-class or poor neighborhoods. Promising to use an iron fist in tackling economic problems, Mr. Maduro said the chain, which had a warehouse full of cooking oil and other items, was making war on the people and would be taken over by a government supermarket network known as Pdval. Venezuela has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil, its only major export, and shortages and long lines at stores are common. Also on Friday, the government filed criminal charges against a manager of the supermarket chain, accusing him of destabilizing the economy. It filed similar charges this week against two executives of the countrys largest pharmacy chain, Farmatodo. ",2015-02-07T02:48:21+0000

Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with Hank. Celine sees his question as a demand. And so they will fight about this  and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women  throughout the course of a day. Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion, A.

The pice de rsistance might be a mock sea battle, the better for mass drownings, in which the amphitheater would be flooded in the morning and drained in time for the afternoon mayhem. But how, exactly, was all this achieved? With a labyrinthine system of underground pulleys, lifts and trap doors to rival the most elaborate Broadway show, says Heinz-Jrgen Beste of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.

us,Wolsey Angels to Go to the V&A Museum,"The Victoria and Albert Museum surpassed its goal on Sunday of raising 2.5 million pounds ($3.8 million) to purchase four statues created by the Italian sculptor Benedetto da Rovezzano for the tomb of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, an adviser to Henry VIII and once one of Englands most powerful men. The statues, known as the Wolsey Angels, were commissioned in 1524, just before the cardinal lost his power after failing to convince the pope to annul the kings marriage. The cardinal appeared in Hilary Mantels novel Wolf Hall. Ms. Mantel said in a statement that the recovery of the angels is one of those miracles that historians pray for; something that seems irrevocably lost has been there all the time. After Wolseys death in 1530, Henry VIII acquired the statues for his own tomb, which was never completed. They were eventually sold during the 1640s to raise money during Englands Civil War and were unheard of again until two surfaced at an auction in 1994. The other pair was discovered in 2008 at a country house in Northamptonshire in central England. The majority of the funds for the purchase came from a two-million pound grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, while another 500,000 pounds came from the Art Fund, a charity that helps British museums purchase art. Additional funds came from donations and museum supporters  including 33,000 pounds from on-site donations and one-pound Save the Wolsey Angels badges. The statutes are on display at the museum but will be temporarily removed to undergo conservation treatment.",2015-02-08T22:59:42+0000

Directed by Amma Asante and written by Misan Sagay, the film chronicles the challenging love life of Belle, an educated beauty  including a dashing suitor, John Davinier (Sam Reid), as well as several not-so-charming ones. The movie also covers Belles uncle, the lord chief justice who must decide on a case involving a Zong slave ship on which more than 130 Africans were massacred for an insurance payment. The movie plays with the historical record for dramatic effect, as is often the case when the past is disinterred for entertainment, and its realism at times groans under the weight of too many passionate speeches, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

To some, Mr. Kyle represents all that was right with the American-led invasion, to others, all that was wrong. Yet to many veterans, his story offers a chance to discuss and debate a remarkable array of complex and personal questions: the mix of motivations that lead people to sign up in the military, the riot of emotions troops feel when they kill or witness death, the struggle to reengage with civilian society upon coming home.

The references to slavery and segregation inspireddebates about how deeply religion was implicated in those institutions(the short answer: a lot more deeply than many Christian conservatives careto admit today, though not in exactly the same way that religion is implicated in the crimes of ISIS; the South was many things, including a home to terrorism, but it was not a utopian theocracy); the reference to the Inquisition inspired some discussion ofjust how bad the institution really was (the answer: not as bad as Black Legend-stylehistory would have it, but at its worst quite, quite bad enough).

Among the lectures, house tours, exhibitions and fairs this year, one unofficial event stands out  and even offers the chance for the snowbound to get in on the action. The auction site Paddle8 has partnered with the design firm Homepolish to create Desert Living: Icons of Modern Design, a pop-up series of interiors vignettes at the Ace Hotel and Swim Clubs 4,000-square-foot clubhouse space. The four installations, says Jason Stein, Paddle8s senior design specialist, reflect what our favorite homes in Palm Springs would be; a setting wed want to live in. And though midcentury art and design are, as expected, well represented, the collectibles on offer extend far beyond the Mad Men-era nostalgia typically associated with the region. One California-themed tableau includes Frank Gehrys cardboard chair, Bill Currys Cattail lamp, John Baldessari prints and an Ed Ruscha painting; another explores the notion of opulence through such pieces as a chrome 1970s Gucci wine cooler and a Helmut Newton nude photograph. And a future-themed area features Gerald McCabes seven-stemmed Daisy table and artwork by Kenny Scharf, Sam Francis and David Hockney. The environments will be accessible to visitors this weekend and are, Stein promises, really layered; for those stuck in less salubrious climes, everything is up for auction starting Wednesday on the Paddle8 site.",2015-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Whats on TV Wednesday,"7 P.M. (Reelz) INVICTUS (2009) This rousing drama from Clint Eastwood, based on the book Playing the Enemy by John Carlin, was inspired by a true story of reconciliation and athletic triumph. Morgan Freeman portrays Nelson Mandela, newly elected as South Africas first black president, and Matt Damon is Franois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by many blacks. Mandela views the team as a vehicle to bring the countrys races together, especially if it can win the Rugby World Cup tournament in 1995, which South Africa is to host. Invictus has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Its an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership. In Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (2013), Justin Chadwicks biopic, at 6:35 on Showtime, Idris Elba portrays Mandela and Naomie Harris is his wife, Winnie. Mr. Elbas towering performance lends Long Walk to Freedom a Shakespearean breadth, Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. His Mandela is an intensely emotional man whose body quakes in moments of sorrow and whose face is stricken with a bone-deep anguish. The carefully chosen words in his eloquent declarations of principle, spoken with gravity and deliberation, are deeply stirring.",2015-02-11T06:00:13+0000

The fact that 36 states (apart from Alabama) now allow same-sex marriage, with rising support from the public, suggests hes probably wrong about that. His central legal claim  that same-sex marriage is a states rights issue, rather than one that implicates the guarantee of equality in the Constitution  is also a loser.

The six inmates, who were all serving lengthy terms for crimes that included drug trafficking and murder, apparently complained about their living conditions to get a meeting with prison officials, whom they then took hostage on Wednesday, according to local news reports. The inmates later took firearms from a prison armory, Taiwans Central News Agency reported. Taiwanese news outlets broadcast a series of demands from the men, including that they be provided with vehicles and that former President Chen Shui-bian, who was convicted of embezzlement and taking bribes in 2009, be returned to prison. Mr. Chen was released on medical parole in January. But early Thursday, the six inmates shot themselves, Mr. Chen, the ministry official, said in a brief televised interview.

Driven more by impatience than by prudence, I decided to go ahead with the plan. Carefully following the precise sequence prescribed by the instructions, I switched on my remote controller and then the Wi-Fi transmitter, and finally double-pressed the power button on the back of the DJI Phantom 2 Vision quadcopter I purchased the night before. The copter trilled, then emitted four consecutive beeps. The GPS system began searching for satellites to map its launch coordinates, and a moment later the rotors whirred to life, sending ripples across a nearby puddle. And then the drone was airborne, rising to a hover six feet above me, conducting an aerial choreography to maintain its position despite the wind pushing it toward Manhattan Avenue. The copter streamed an image to my iPhone  me with my cap pulled low against the November drizzle, head tilted to meet the cameras gaze. A drone selfie.

To Note continues: To declare of exercise the right to attack or destroy any vessel entering the prescribed area on the high seas without first determining its belligerent nationality and the contraband character of its cargo is an act so unprecedented in naval warfare that this Government is reluctant to believe that the Imperial Government of Germany in this case contemplates it as possible.

On Thursday, State Senator Jessie Ulibarri, a Democrat, submitted an amendment that would have assigned funds collected from immigrant applicants to pay for the program. The Republican-controlled Senate voted down the measure. Unauthorized immigrants can receive drivers licenses in 10 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Colorados program began in 2014, and state motor vehicle offices issuing these license have been swamped with requests from immigrants. But critics maintain that the program rewards people who have crossed into the country without authorization. Last month, the states joint budget committee voted not to approve about $166,000 in new funds for the program, forcing officials to lay off workers and stop issuing the licenses at four of the five participating motor vehicle offices. One office, in Denver, was left to process the licenses. ",2015-02-13T01:09:45+0000

The article asserted that Mr. Coulibaly had arranged for her travel to lands controlled by the Islamic State before the attack. She was quoted as saying that she was happy to be living in an area controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and was quoted as advising other women followers of the group to be bases of support and safety for your husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons. Turkish officials have said that Ms. Boumeddiene traveled to Turkey from Spain before the Paris attack and entered Syria through a Turkish border crossing on Jan. 8, one day before the supermarket siege.

During her glamorous previous life in the 1990s, Newbery was the assistant to Susan Train, the legendary Paris bureau chief of American Vogue, and later served as office manager for John Galliano, back when he was being courted by LVMH to take over Givenchy. Next, she moved to London where she penned three rollicking romans  clef about the fashion industry, before leaving that world for good. Today, with her press-shy English husband, Newbery runs Common Farm Flowers, a floral company that delivers cheerful bouquets and centerpieces by mail throughout Britain. They grow most of the flowers organically themselves at Common Farm, a seven-acre spread with a ramshackle house they are restoring. Newbery has also returned to her original love of writing and combined it with her third career as a florist, producing The Flower Farmers Year: How to Grow Cut Flowers for Pleasure andProfit ($30, Green Books), a richly illustrated how-to guide in which Newbery shares all that she has learned in her 10years in the fields of southern England.",2015-02-13T15:00:11+0000

Thats because Hornby, who made his name with the 1995 novel High Fidelity, has lately embraced Hollywood in a big way. He received an Oscar nomination for his screenplay for the 2009 movie An Education (adapted from Lynn Barbers memoir), then went on to adapt Cheryl Strayeds Wild, currently in theaters, and Colm Toibins novel Brooklyn, which had its premiere last month at Sundance. (Interestingly, Hornby did not write the screenplay for High Fidelity, which jumped to film in 2000, or any of his other books to become movies  confirming the wisdom that its better to operate on other peoples children than your own.) In a recent online interview with The Atlantic, Hornby, who is British, explained why he had actively pursued the Wild gig: Theres a side of me that responds very deeply to American things, he said. The book to me felt like a Springsteen album. I always loved Springsteen, but hes very American. That kind of directness is really interesting to me because it doesnt have to be unsubtle.

It seems almost incredible that it was only five years ago that Blriot made the pioneer aeroplane trip across the Channel, so vast and rapid has been the progress since. The raid not only represents the largest fleet of air craft that has ever operated together, but it is a fitting reply to the German bombardment of British towns, and a warning to the Kaisers forces in Belgium of further damage. One fact well demonstrated by the raid is that in case of such an attack, land guns are unreliable defences, and it is necessary to meet aeroplanes with aeroplanes. The attack probably puts an end to Germanys reputed intention to use Zeebrugge and other places on the Belgian coast as bases for submarines. The Admiralty states that no submarines were seen. This indicates that German preparations are too incomplete for them to trust these craft in Belgian harbors.  The New York Herald, European Edition, Feb. 14, 1915",2015-02-13T21:10:34+0000

Starting Thursday, a broad sweep of her unsettling work will inaugurate Bridget Donahue, a new gallery on the Lower East Side being opened by a longtime director at Gavin Browns Enterprise, the West Village gallery. Ms. Donahue said she had been drawn to Ms. Hershman Leeson as a kind of prophet of our cybernetic condition, through early interactive works that delved into artificial intelligence and surveillance and yearslong performances that blurred the line between acting and life. The show, Origins of the Species, through April 5, will span from the late 1960s to recent work exploring the implications of genetic manipulation. (99 Bowery, 2nd floor; bridgetdonahue.nyc.)

On the cover is Bjork, whose genre-bending songs and mastery of design, technology and visuals have been pushing music forward for the past three decades, and who is being honored with her first retrospective at MoMA next month. We pay a visit to Sharjah, where the progressive sheikhs daughter, Hoor Al Qasimi, has inherited  and subsequently boosted the profile of  a humble but growing art expo with some serious indie cred. Stateside, we take a closer look at Philip Johnsons iconic Glass House, which may be the late architects greatest achievement (even if its not quite right to call it his home). And in the never-dull French capital, where politicians have been known to air their laundry for all to see, Liesl Schillinger spins a true-life tale of sex, lies and presidents truly befitting the City of Light. Elsewhere, Cathy Horyn assesses the promise and perils of a post-trend fashion world; a pair of authors and a visual artist spill secrets from their diaries; a writer with a rare skin condition that keeps her isolated from the outside world sheds light on her life in the darkness; the talented and at-times controversial French-Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan sets his sights on Hollywood; and the prolific makeup artist Pat McGrath gets a close-up of her own in By the Numbers.

Mr. Rezaian was formally charged in January, even though the judiciary has not disclosed any details. His mother, Mary Rezaian, said that under Iranian law, Mr. Rezaian should be put on trial by early March, within 60 days after formal charges are set. But now, she said, there are rumblings that her sons case will not be heard until after the Persian New Year holiday, which falls on March 21 and lasts for about two weeks, so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6. Mrs. Rezaian, an American who lives in Turkey, made the assertions in a written commentary posted on CNNs website. American officials and The Post have repeatedly called on Iran to release Mr. Rezaian, 38, a dual Iranian-American citizen. ",2015-02-14T00:41:04+0000

Green on Blue is a novel that conveys, with harrowing power, the fallout that decades of war (going back through the Soviet occupation of the 1980s) has had on that countrys people, and at the same time, its a kind of Greek tragedy about the cycles of revenge and violence that can consume families and tribes, generation after generation.

The auction house Christies announced last week that the original working manuscript and typed drafts to the song  16 pages total  would be auctioned on April 7 in New York. Mr. McLean, 69, told Reuters he decided to sell the documents on a whim. Other than admitting that a line in the song, the day the music died, refers to the Feb. 3, 1959, deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. Richardson, known as the Big Bopper, Mr. McLean has been mostly vague about the meaning of other parts of the song. He told Reuters that the writing and lyrics will divulge everything there is to divulge. American Pie was released in 1971.

But new cases have generally been increasing in Guinea and Sierra Leone in recent weeks, and Mr. Ban said that more than half of the newly infected people in those two countries had not been in contact with people known to have been infected. This reminds us that setbacks can quickly follow apparent gains, he said. Dr. David Nabarro, appointed by Mr. Ban to lead the United Nations anti-Ebola effort, also spoke to the General Assembly and expressed concern about unsafe burials of Ebola victims, considered a major source of new transmissions.

People filled the empty spaces between tents, spilling out of a metro stop and pouring over concrete barriers with the help of carefully constructed wooden steps. They lined up for free souvenirs  silk-screened T-shirts, leather necklaces, protest stickers  and gathered around microphones for open meetings. They threw glitter and snapped photographs.

us,"My Dear, Dear, Dear Watson","Part of the Internets beauty is the space it affords people to take an idea and run with it ... and run with it and run with it, until they end up miles away from where they started. Among a subset of online superfans of the BBC show Sherlock, solving mysteries is mere window dressing for the real story: one about unrequited love between Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman). This sort of wholesale invention, by viewers, of a romance between fictional characters who are not romantically linked on-screen is a form of something known as shipping (short for relationship-ing, the term can also refer to rooting for actual fictional couples). It is by no means limited to Sherlock  any form of pop culture, from Scandal to One Direction, is fair game  but that show has inspired vast and vivid fictional worlds, completely imagined by shippers who share screenshots, drawings and even entire books speculating about what a dalliance between Sherlock and Watson (or Johnlock, as its known) might look like. These fans wring meaning out of every lingering glance and anguished expression that crosses Cumberbatchs impressively dimensioned face and superimpose their own dialogue atop these moments, amassing a trove of erotic imaginings that is in some respects more compelling than the canon, at least in the unpredictability of the plot twists. For example, one offshoot of Johnlock, known as Fawnlock, imagines Cumberbatch as an ethereal deer, complete with graceful antlers and a speckled coat  and of course his lover, Watson, cradled in his forelimbs.",2015-02-19T04:18:19+0000

us,Whats on TV Thursday,"8:30 P.M. (CBS) THE ODD COUPLE Matthew Perry stars as Oscar Madison, a slovenly sports radio host, and Thomas Lennon is Felix Unger, an avowed neat freak, in this remake of the 70s Jack Klugman-Tony Randall sitcom about roommates struggling to survive their divorces. Wendell Pierce plays Oscars agent; Leslie Bibb lives in their building and is willing to date Oscar, but only for sex; and Lauren Graham is his ex-wife. The new show updates the surface details without dissolving the central bond between the two friends, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. This is Mr. Perrys third attempt at sitcom success after a decade on Friends, and there is an uneasiness to his performance  in some scenes he looks startled, even frightened  that makes it hard to play off Mr. Lennon, who seems very comfortable as a nervous nelly. That chemistry could come with time, but even if the show flops, its an interesting experiment. In The Big Bang Theory, leading in at 8, Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) gets some startling news as the gang prepares to help Stuart (Kevin Sussman) celebrate the reopening of his comic book store.

Last month, the artist received a 2014 U.S. State Department Medal of Arts; and this week, he prepares for his first museum retrospective, A New Republic, which will open at the Brooklyn Museum on Friday. Throughout his career, Wileys pieces have canonized the people they portray: Descendants from Africa, Haiti, Jamaica and elsewhere, depicted along with emblems of culture and identity. My work, for a long time, has focused on the ideals that we celebrate in America and abroad, he says. Many of his paintings outsource their influence from popular movements that predate the 19th century, like Flemish portraiture from the Northern Renaissance. But instead of using dark colors to create a sense of severity or authority, Wileys portraits explode with energy and color  particularly in their use of clothing, which occupies a central role in his work. Fashion is fragile and fleeting, he notes. But it is also an indicator for the cultural and social appetites for a nation.",2015-02-19T21:30:41+0000

The repurposing and recycling of objects, images and forms  from other art, her own work, her life  are prominent in Ms. Skaers work, as with many artists today. The strategy yields outstanding results in the five related sculptures at Murray Guy. The tone is set by a low-lying sculpture: two thick, rough-edged slices of mahogany inlaid with smaller objects found around her studio  a tiny prototype, parts of other sculptures, a small lithography stone and an oblong blue ceramic tile. The piece, which evokes sculptures by Carl Andre and Bruce Nauman, is itself a prototype for the next four: an all-ceramic version; one in marble with touches of malachite; another in aluminum with gunmetal; and, finally, an all-wood version (including veneer). Together they form a stunning meditation on processes, materials and craft, on mutating details and textural contrasts, on looking, achieving an almost cosmic scope.

Its not necessarily the novel youd expect from the man who played Hank Moody.

But beneath the goofy plot, which The Huffington Post described, not wholly favorably, as a mash-up between Animal Farm and Chicken Run,  Duchovny is thinking seriously about environmentalism and animal rights. Its an attitude of brotherhood, he told Kirkus, not only with other human beings, but with all the animals on the planet.

Simmons will win for best supporting actor as a music teacher from hell in Whiplash. In the best actress category, Julianne Moore is the front-runner for her portrait of a professor with early-onset Alzheimers in Still Alice, while Patricia Arquette, as a mother filmed across 12 years in Boyhood, is the favorite for supporting actress. And Alejandro G. Irritus Birdman may squeak by in the best picture category, which is filled out by Richard Linklaters Boyhood, a close contender; Clint Eastwoods American Sniper; Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel; Morten Tyldums The Imitation Game; Ava DuVernays Selma; James Marshs The Theory of Everything and Damien Chazelles Whiplash. Mr. Irritu, Mr. Linklater, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Tyldum and Bennett Miller, for Foxcatcher, are also nominated for best director.

Snowden, the National Security Agency whistle-blower, contacted her in January 2013, using the name Citizenfour. When Mr. Snowden let Ms. Poitras know that he would not conceal his identity as the source of information about N.S.A. surveillance, she persuaded him to let her film their encounter. This Oscar-nominated documentary chronicles the encounter in a Hong Kong hotel room of Ms. Poitras; Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who first wrote about Mr. Snowdens revelations; and Mr. Snowden as he hands over classified documents that provide evidence of the N.S.A.s invasion of privacy and copes with the resulting media storm. Cinema, even in the service of journalism, is always more than reporting, and focusing on what Ms. Poitrass film is about risks ignoring what it is, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Its a tense and frightening thriller that blends the brisk globe-trotting of the Bourne movies with the spooky, atmospheric effects of a Japanese horror film. And it is also a primal political fable for the digital age, a real-time tableau of the confrontation between the individual and the state. He added: Thinking about the issues Ms. Poitras raises can induce a kind of epistemological vertigo. What do we know about what is known about us? Who knows it? Can we trust them?

Draped horizontally on a plinth with fingers pinched in a Cleopatran gesture, Huxtable was originally meant to be immortalized in one of her signature looks before Benson, apprehensively, asked her to pose nude. I was nervous of what she might think of that, he says, so I sent her this intense email full of historical references. And though she is without clothing, her personal style is retained in the braids Benson painstakingly drew in a digital drafting program and the green makeup spray-painted onto the statues skin. The artwork stands as a token of how virtuosity and virtuality come together in the digital age. I want the sculpture to exist as a completely finished entity inside the computer, Benson says.

us,Bear Extraordinaire,"In the annals of human-animal comradeship, there is nothing quite like the tale of a brown bear cub named Winnipeg, Winnie for short, the inspiration behind A. A. Milnes Winnie-the-Pooh. She was bought for $20 by a Canadian soldier at the outset of World War I, sailed with him to England, then ended up living out her years at the London Zoo. There, a little boy named Christopher Robin took a shine to her, renaming his own stuffed bear Winnie and prompting his father to write the classic childrens books. As a new picture book by Sally M. Walker plays it, this is a gee-whiz kind of story, with one improbable, satisfying moment after another and little to no conflict. Jonathan D. Vosss sweetly realistic, nostalgic watercolor illustrations go down easy as well, casting a benign glow even over scenes of army life during wartime. The little brown bear is adorable and affectionate, winning the heart of every human she comes into contact with, and her owner, Harry Colebourn, is a paragon of kind, virtuous, never-say-never manhood. Though Winnie earned her place in history accidentally, Walkers storybook narration makes her legendary status seem well deserved, even preordained.",2015-02-25T15:00:26+0000

The Second Nightshade, a Symphonic Nocturne for chamber orchestra, came in 1991. Final Nightshade, an Adagio of the Night for full orchestra, ended the series in 2003. All three works explore extreme contrasts of high and low, loud and soft, fast and slow, and such, as the composer explains in liner notes. But nothing can explain the cosmic allure, audacious inventiveness and gripping strangeness of Mr. Ruderss ingenious music. This recording album brings together three recordings of the three works made over 17 years, conducted respectively by Oliver Knussen (with the Capricorn ensemble), Paul Mann and Scott Yoo (with the Odense Symphony Orchestra).

It was a stark contrast to the brands bold spring/summer 2015 look, which involved bleached eyebrows with striking cat-eye makeup. It was very funny because last season was a nod to punk  and for Miu Miu we had bad girls, she said, referring to her work with another Prada S.p.A.-owned label.

At the time, American companies and governments still bought insurance from the old British firms, and the payouts to San Francisco were enormous. As was standard practice, the insurers paid in gold, shipping $65 million worth of bars  an estimated 107 tons, representing 14 percent of all British gold reserves  to the Bay Area. Afraid that all that gold leaving its vaults would permanently impoverish the kingdom, the Bank of England doubled interest rates on British bonds. In response, so many wealthy Americans sent money to England that, a few months after the gold came west from London, $30 million in U.S. gold traveled east.

Grahams great body of work, summarized in From the New World, her new career-spanning selected poems (one can understand why active poets resist the tombstone of a collected volume), has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing. Or so it seems to me  as anxious, I realize, as everyone else to make my case.",2015-02-27T15:46:22+0000

Because Welsh, known for his gleeful depictions of the depraved degenerates who populate Scotlands seediest hollows, has turned his attention to one of his adopted homes, Miami Beach, that sun-drenched refuge for strutting grotesques and desperate narcissists. This is not Welshs first Rollerblade around Florida; Crime followed a coke-addled Edinburgh detective along the same bright sidewalks. It is, however, his first to be narrated by two Americans. And not just any two Americans. Female ones. This is a man who once successfully narrated a portion of a novel from the point of view of a tapeworm.

Richard Rhodes has put this question to a test by writing an aggressively anti-ideological history of one of the most extravagantly ideological events that has ever occurred, the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. The Spanish war broke out because, on one side, the radically leftist Socialist Party pushed the Republican government ever further to the left, and large parts of the labor movement pushed still more sharply leftward, unto the zones of collectivist and libertarian revolution  and because, on the opposite side, the national army and most of the Catholic Church and other parts of society veered sharply rightward, unto the nether regions of the fascist extreme. And, well, the two sides could not get along. Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin made their own specialized contributions. Three years of this and Generalissimo Francisco Franco became the caudillo of Spain, and wartime atrocities gave way to peacetime atrocities.",2015-02-27T15:51:20+0000

(Its currently No. 3 in paperback, after 100 weeks.) Still, Macdonald was unprepared for the kind of success her book has achieved  particularly in her native England, where it was published last year and has become something of a sensation. Its freaking me out a bit! she told The Belfast Telegraph recently. There was a moment about two weeks ago when I went to do a book talk. People were queuing up to get books signed, and some were incredibly nervous and had shaking hands. I was horrified! They didnt see me as a person  they saw me as a place holder for being a writer or author or some figure that wasnt really me. That threw me into a massive wobble! Her experience, she said, taught me that this relationship with what is technically very much a wild animal is a way of getting in touch with all sorts of elemental things. . . .

(TCM) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet young man and Brad Pitt is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother, in this adaptation of Mr. Macleans 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression  and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this visually stunning film, for which Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for best cinematography. Between the novellas well-known first sentence (In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing) and its elegiac last line (I am haunted by waters), A River Runs Through It circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Macleans early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories. She added: Its easy to recognize Robert Redfords reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love. While the film is more lavish than Mr. Macleans story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean  of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace  are ably reflected on the screen. The evenings lineup, part of TCMs 31 Days of Oscar, continues with A Few Good Men (1992), at 10:30; The English Patient (1996), at 1 a.m.; and The Fisher King (1991), at 4.",2015-02-28T06:00:11+0000

us,"After Boris Nemtsovs Assassination, There Are No Longer Any Limits","On Friday evening, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and former first deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, went on a prominent Moscow radio station to exhort his fellow citizens to come out to protest President Vladimir Putins policies. There would be a rally on Sunday, a spring march, to demonstrate against the deepening economic crisis and Russias involvement in Ukraine. The most prominent Russian opposition leader, Aleksei Navalny, had been put in jail for 15 days, which just happened to be long enough to keep him from attending the rally. Nemtsov, who was older and, by now, less influential, had handed out leaflets in the metro and encouraged people to come anyway.",2015-02-28T19:21:38+0000

Its an androgynous look, McGrath told T today before the show. Its all about the brows. To make them stand out, McGrath said she put pencil and shadows into the brow and brushed them through for a natural feel. The result was a clean look, which aligned nicely with Palaus take on the hair, which he described as boyish, simple, very minimal. To get the uncomplicated style, Palau used Redken Satinwear 02 Prepping Blow-Dry Lotion to achieve a smooth blowout and Forceful 23 Super Strength Finishing Spray to keep the bangs in place. Finally, Wind Blown 05 Dry Finishing Spray completed the coiffure and added some texture. Palau said the completed look was quintessential Sander, embodying masculine femininity rather than feminine femininity. And to top it all off, Palau threw in a small quirk: a bobby pin on the side to add a bit of charm.",2015-02-28T19:30:01+0000
