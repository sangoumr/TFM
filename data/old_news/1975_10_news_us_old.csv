For seven rounds in a row he bludgeoned his man with hooks, hounding him into corners, nailing him to the ropes. And then, when Ali seemed hopelessly beaten, he came on like the good champion he is. In the 12th round, the 13th and all through a cruel 14th, Ali punched the shapeless, grinning mask that pursued him until Eddie Futch could take no more.",1975-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Next scene: the Africans, in expensive European suits, sit around the table, the white men stand importantly behind as ""advisers"" and pass them briefcases stuffed with money, the black soldiers push back black crowds and rid the streets of unsightly beggars.In a way, therefore, Osmane Sembene's cutting, radiant and hilarious film ""Xala,"" which opens at the New York Film Festival this evening, is ""Animal Farm"" applied to Africa independence.It is part fable and part satire, but it is much more: with the greatest fineness and delicacy, Mr. Sembene, the Senegalese writer and director who made this picture, has set out a portrait of the complex and conflicting mesh of traditions, aspirations and frustrations of a culture knocked askew by colonialism and distorting itself anew while climbing out.Mr. Sembene sets his fable not among the new politicians but the new businessmen. The President and his cabinet are in fact the president and governing body of the Chamber of Commerce, but they represent the new lite of corrupt power and corrupt money combined.The story centers on the downfall of El Hadji, one of the pillars of the chamber. El Hadji, a tall, aging man who wears his corruption as a flaring innocence, runs the town's import business. He brings in whisky, perfume, yoghurt and bottled water, which is used, among other things, to wash his white Mercedes-Benz.El Hadji is taking a third wife, and the garden party to celebrate the marriage, attended by the cream of this clotted society, is a comic and mordant masterpiece. Cabinet ministers arrange deals among the whisky, two businessmen discuss plans for ""le weekend"" and wonder what the English word for it is, a new automobile for the bride arrives tied up in ribbons.It is the series of quick scenes between El Hadji and his first two wives that adds humanity and social dimension, however, Adja, the first wife, is traditional African: a woman with dignity, presence and an angry acceptance of her displacement. The second wife, Oumi, is a fading sexpot, a modern Africanof the nineteen-fifties, with no training whatsoever in acceptance.Bitter rivals at the start, the two women are slowly pushed together by the new threat of the third marriage. In one splendid shot they sit side by side along the wall, bypassed, each holding a plate of food and a glass of Coca-Cola.El Hadji is alone with his young bride and discoversshatteringly  that someone has laid a curse (the ""Xala"" of the title) upon him. He is impotent.It is a catastrophe: a public one. He consults the President, who sends him to his private witch doctor. El Hadji, in his Paris-made suit, sits in a bush hut being magicked, but to no avail. A second witch doctor is tried, with somewhat better results.But the lionhe is a jackal, really, but the charity Sembene shows to his personages at the same time he is being ruthless with them allows El Hadji dignity as well as squalor  is wounded and must fall. He is implicated in a financial scandal and his fellow thieves at the Chamber of Commerce expel him.Wife Number Two moves out, Wife Number Three is removed by her mother; Wife Number One remains with the stunned and broken El Hadji. His impotence, furthermore, is back upon him: the check he gave the second witch doctor bounced.In comes a procession of crippled beggars that has been seen at various points during the film. El Hadji can become himself again  not himself as a profiteer but himself as a man and an Africanif he will strip and let himself be spit upon.He does, and the end comes with a visual and symbolic wrench. It is too sudden and didacticfurthermore, as is almost inevitable when it is a matter of relentless decline and fallthe movie has already begun to drag.It is a fault but not a ruinous one: ""Xala"" is an instructive delight.",1975-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'Mechant':An Understated Swiss Comedy by Goretta,"Switzerland, Swiss film makers seem to be telling us, is a perfect Swiss movement that doesn't deliver the correct time. None of the best Swiss films we've been seeing here recently""La Salamandre,"" ""The Middle of the World"" and ""The Invitation,"" among otherscould be easily categorized as social or political in content. They share a comically reserved manner that is hardly the thing for agit-prop. Yet each in its way is as deeply concerned about the quality of life as any of Godard's more revolutionary films.Such a film is ""Pas Si Mchant Que Ca"" ""Not Really That Bad""), the second feature by the extremely gifted Claude Goretta, whose first, ""The Invitation,"" remains one of the most finely boned comedies to be released in New York this year. The new film will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 6:15 and repeated there Friday at 9:30.""Pas Si Mchant,"" which will be titled ""The Wonderful Crook"" when it is released here commercially, is not a comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles or tossing your hat in the air or even laughing all that much. Which may be a terrible thing to say about a comedy early in a review, but I suspect that audiences need a bit of preparation for this particular Swiss film.It deals in small events, in details so practical that one is apt not to notice the comic attitude it wears. Its method is either carefully elliptical or understated. Indeed, even its overstatements are understatedand it is delightful.""Pas Si Mchant"" is the story of a not quite perfect son's coming of age in a perfect world. There is some irony in this, of course. He is Pierre (Gerard Depardieu), a happy-go-lucky fellow, married to a sweet, earthy girl and the father of a small child. Pierre works, though not very hard, in his father's small furniture factory, where everything is fashioned with care by hand, of wood that, his father says, breathes.When Pierre's father is incapacitated by a stroke, Pierre must take over the factory and learns to his sorrow that it's such a financial failure it's on the edge of bankruptcy. To meet the payroll Pierre takes to robbing post offices and banks. Each month he packs up a load of furniture that has been ordered by bogus customers, drives into the country where he burns it, and then stops by a bank just before closing for a quick illegal withdrawal.Something is obviously wrong when the kind of workmanship represented by this one factory can no longer be afforded, but then there is also something wrong with Pierre. Mr. Goretta apparently has a cheerfully open mind about bank robbing, which is one of the pleasures of the film, but not about Pierre, which is what gives the film its impact.Pierre, as charming as he is, deceitfully implicates everyone he would protect, including both his wife, Marthe (Dominique Labourier) and the plucky young woman, Nelly (Marene Jobert), whom he meets in the course of a heist and who subsequently becomes his mistress.Pierre has style and he displays a good deal of grace under pressure, but he's a crybaby too. With the best of intentions, he winds up failing everyone, especially Nelly, who has joined his life of mini-crime with her eyes wide open.Mr. Goretta's direction looks deceptively simple. The characters and situations seem familiar at the start, yet little by little, scene by scene, you realize that the film is not simple at all, as when Pierre, rough-housing with his son, becomes just as excited and semihysterical as the child. In another scene the patrons of a corner bar watch an Italian immigrant worker dancing drunkenly with a vase of flowers, making everyone desperately uncomfortable. Obliquely we learn more than we ever thought possible.Mr. Depardieu is very funny and complex in the pivotal role, which is not totally appealing, though the women's roles are. Philippe Leotard, the hero of ""The Middle of the World,"" is fine in a supporting role, as is Michel Robin, the lonely bachelor of ""The Invitation."" A whole different subject is the superior quality of the ensemble acting in these new Swiss productions.",1975-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Violent 'Framed':Corruption Triumphs in Story of Gambler,"Although its plot is convoluted, ""Framed,"" which arrived yesterday at Loews State 2 and other houses, is basically uncomplicated. Crime, it's obvious here, is not subtle. The writer-director star team of Mort Briskin, Phil Karlson and Joe Don Baker, who previously struck a bonanza with ""Walking Tall,"" are now simply fighting gunfire with gunfire and beatings with beatings. ""Walking Tall"" may have-dramatized the true story of a crusading, if violent, Tennessee sheriff, but ""Framed"" is not so much the business of justice triumphing as it is corruption and violence triumphant.Our hero-gambler-night-club-owner's luck is bad from the start when he wins a big bundle at poker. Almost immediately he runs into a murderous, if mysterious, ambush, a slugging match with a deputy he kills in self defense and a frame-up by the cops and shadowy political types that lands him in jail. But our tough boy takes no pushing around and, with the aid of a gangster big shot who admires his guts and gambling, he's out, muscles quivering and gun in hand, to get his framers and, of course, his loot.As the indestructible gambler, Joe Don Baker convincingly combines a linebacker's physique and a laconic Southern talk to absorb a going-over that hospitalizes him and then engages in a succession of bloody clashes that dispatches a platoon of the rough opposition, including one whose ear he shoots off.All this action is not that unusual, of course, but it does include some workman-like performances by, among others, Gabriel Dell, as Mr. Baker's prison pal and a hit man; John Marley, as the gang boss who aids him, and Brock Peters, as an honest deputy. Conny Van Dyke, our hero's pretty girlfriend as well as singer and partner, who has been mauled and raped by the bad guys, may not be just plain folks but she is awfully logical when she says after one gory bout, ""I just don't understand you.""",1975-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen:Cold, Bright 'Katharina Blum' Is at Festival","""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum,"" based on Heinrich Bll's German novel that was published here in English this year, is movie that looks as if it had been made out of steel. It is cold and bright and has dozens of lethal edges. It's very difficult to like even though it has things to admire. The film, a dramatized polemic about what it sees as the excesses of freedom in the democracy of West Germany today, makes its point, with tiny variations, as relentlessly as someone dealing in Revealed Truths.The movie will be shown at the New York Film Festival this evening at 6:15 and again on Monday at 9:30.Volker Schlondorff, the German director (""Young Torless,"" ""The Sudden Wealth of the Poor People of Kombach,"" etc.), and Margareth von Trotta, his actress-wife, with whom he has collaborated on his recent screenplays, including ""A Free Woman,"" share both the writing and directing credits on this new film.""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"" is about the systematic victimization of a poor but proud young woman, who works as a housekeeper and waitress and who has the bad luck to pick up and take home from a party, for one night only, a young man who is suspected by the German police of being a terrorist. Katharina had never met the young man before, but circumstantial evidence makes it appear as if she had been his mistress for months.In a period of several days, Katharina's privacy and, particularly, her honor are destroyed, first by the police, who terrorize her, and then by the yellow press, which creates in her name the image of a politicized Bonnie Parker, beautiful, heartless and on fire for the Communist cause.Though Katharina is quite quickly cleared, her life has been ruined. When she decides to take a gun to the reporter who was instrumental in her downfall, someone piously declares that the shots Katharina fired were aimed not at the reporter but at the freedom of the press.One of the difficulties with the way Mr. Schlondorff and Miss von Trotta handle their subject matter is that although everything happens in the course of the movie, it is completely without surprises. There are no unusual"" insights, no progressions of understanding. Paradoxically, this is not true of Mr. Bll's novel, though the book opens with the act of violence that the film saves until the end.Mr. Bll tells Katharina's story mostly in terms of secondhand informationin official police reports and in the words of people who knew her, and only once in her own terms, and that's an official statement that continues to keep Katharina at a distance from the reader.The film sees Katharina frontally close up. The mystery, of her passion and her resolve is maintained only by the carefully controlled, implacable performance of Angela Winkler, a handsome, dark-haired woman who looks a good deal like Susan Sontagan unimportant fact, perhaps, but one that makes it difficult to believe Katharina as a waitress.I'm not familiar with the German press, and it may be that it's as outrageous as the movie describes. ""We have to help simple people express themselves,"" says a wicked reporter while he puts words into the mouth of Katharina's dying mother. The corruption portrayed by the film is so pervasive that one expects it to challenge us more. It doesn't. Instead it has the effect of numbing us. Its singleminded intensity nails the imagination to the floor.This may be exactly what the film makers intended to do, but it's not the kind of movie that greatly interests me. ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"" is less a drama than a neo-Brechtian demonstration of a known lack of principles.",1975-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Nostalgia:'Hearts of West' Views Early 30's Hollywood,"The early nineteen-thirties in Hollywood: sound is still a new toy, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford are virtually kids at M-G-M, and the Warner brothers are beginning to turn out those terrifically popular films about gangsters and G-men, and imposing historical personages who look like Paul Muni. Hollywood is approaching its Golden Age and Americans can't get their fill of the talkies, formerly referred to as photoplays.That's one side of the old Hollywood. The glamorous side. The other side is the scroungy, tacky world of B-pictures  Westerns, war movies, raucous musicals, shot on shoestrings on back-lots and in the nearby hills, by fly-by-night operators who make the major studio film makers look like Cellinis.This is the eccentric world recalled with such affection and good humor by ""Hearts of the West,"" the benign comedy directed by Howard Zeiff that will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 9:30. The film, which will be shown again at the festival Tuesday evening at 6:15, will open its regular commercial run at the Sutton Theater on Wednesday.""Hearts of the West,"" written by Rob Thompson, a brand-new Hollywood writer, is a kind of testimonial to innocence. There's not a truly nasty person in the movie, though it has its share of operators and con artists, each of whom fails with varying degrees of ineptitude.The film tells the remarkable adventures of an Iowa farm boy named Lewis Tater (Jeff Bridges), whose father is called Pa Tater and who dreams of becoming a writer of Western novels like Zane Grey.To this end Lewis goes west to pick up local color and winds up, instead, reluctantly being groomed as a Western star of B-pictures directed with a stunning hysterical lack of talent by a Mr. Kessler (Alan Arkin). When Kessler is shooting on location and running behind schedule, he likes to hear his ""cowboys"" sitting around the campfire at night yelling encouraging cowboy yells. It gives him reassurance.""Hearts of the West"" is full of delightful detailsmost notably, Mr. Arkinbut it is sometimes too innocent for its own good. It meanders in a way that would horrify any B-picture maker. It develops characters and situations and then doesn't do anything much with them, which is a luxury that even A-pictures have never easily afforded. And, in Lewis, it has a hero who must be two things at oncea comic dunderhead, a sort of a Merton-of-the-movies, to give the film comic drive, as well as straight man, to give it poignancy. It doesn't always work.Instead, the film is carried by the consistent intelligence of its observations and the sweetness with which it tolerates ineffectual rogues, rascals and fanatics of a very parochial kind. These include a cowboy ""extra"" who says proudly of his own profile, ""Reeks character, that's what they said,"" as well as Mr. Bridges's Lewis, who is always writing in his head. Suffering a setback in his Hollywood career, he bucks himself up by rewriting his life: ""Living by his wits . . . he met the challenge of this womanless land.""The film is also consistently well played by Mr. Arkin and Mr. Bridges and the large supporting cast, including Blythe Danner, Andy Griffith, Donald Pleasence and by Richard B. Shull and Anthony James, who recall Twain's Duke and Dauphin as operators of a phony correspondence school for writers.""Hearts of the West"" may well be the kind of imperfect movie that is as much as it is just because of the ways in which it is imperfect. This was one of the charms of Mr. Zeiff's ""Slither,"" and it could be that Mr. Zeiff's talent is one we must learn to appreciate without wishing it were more conventionally slick.",1975-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Companero,' and 'Princess,' a Double Bill of Longing and Lament","""The English florists simply do not know how to make a garland. I had to show them how to do it,"" the Princess (Madhur Jaffrey), daughter of a maharajah, complains daintily to her guest as she flutters about the tea table in her posh London town house. The princess affects the mannerisms and vocabulary of the English aristocracy and laments the passage of an India that weighed its princes in gold and sent its royal children to English boarding school where, after a few years they had no idea if they were English or Indian.The occasion is a party for two marking the birthday of the Princess's late father. It's an annual occasion. The garland hangs over the full-portrait of the maharajah, whom her aging guest James Mason had served first as a tutor and then as a secretary of state.The guest, whom the Princess calls Cyril Sahib, is a singular sort of man who, as he recognizes his own disappointments, tries politely to correct the Princess's statements about the past. Though she never quite understands him, he indulges her. She is the last link he has to the past.James Ivory's 60-minute film, ""Autobiography of a Princess,"" is a delicate, autumnal satire, funny at some moments, bitter at others, and illuminated throughout by the kind of appreciation for lost civilizations that is shared by all of Mr. Ivory's films about India, from ""Shakespeare Wallah"" through ""Bombay Talkie.""It will be seen at the New York Film Festival this evening at 6 on a bill with ""Compaero,"" a 60-minute film about Victor Jara, the Chilean folk singer who was one of the victims of the right-wing revolution that overthrew the Government of the late President Salvador Allende in 1973. The two films have very little in common but it's a moving program.By far the more interesting cinematically, is ""Autobiography of a Princess,"" which is to conventional feature-length films what a novella is to a novel. It is a compact movie, dense with information and contradictory feelings.Through the interplay between the Princess and Cyril Sahib, and with the aid of some home movies that the Princess shows, Mr. Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the screenplay, manage to bring three very curious characters to life. They are the Englishman who went to India for a year and stayed, effectively, until he was drained of his life, the spoiled, silly Princess who is out of place in both India and England, and her father, ""Dear Papa,"" who was obviously a tyrant though the Princess persists in thinking of him as some sort of libertarian.""Why,"" says the Princess, ""there were hardly any suttees.""""What about your great-aunt?"" asks Cyril Sahib.""That was different,"" the Princess replies crossly. ""She loved her husband so much she didn't want to live without him.""There are awkward moments in the film. Mr. Ivory introduces a television interview with the Maharani of Jaipur and her son, which is funny and informative but doesn't match the quality of the fiction that he is spinning so economically with Miss Jaffrey and with Mr. Mason.The latter has one especially marvelous moment when he recalls his creeping awareness of the rot that was destroying his life in the final Indian years. ""Those ceremonies,"" he says. ""As the years went on the ceremonies blended together. I knew less and less.... All those crowds, and always the waiting, and the confusion about how the thing was to be done.""""Autobiography of a Princess"" is a small, elegant, oblique film. ""Compaero"" is small, angry and straightforward, composed mainly of an interview with the late Mr. Jara's English-born wife, Joan Turner, who talks at length and in extremely affecting terms about her husband, his commitment to the revolution, his talent, and his murder in the Santiago soccer stadium two days after the coup.The film was directed by Martin Smith, an Englishman, and the soundtrack carries Mr. Jara's voice singing the songs that made him such a popular figure in his own country.",1975-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Straub's Version of 'Aaron and Moses' by Schoenberg Is Uncompromising,"At first, movies were silent images: Then sound was added. For some time now, the German director Jean-Marie Straub has been at work trying to remove the images.In his latest filmit can't be called a movie because virtually nothing moves, neither the camera nor what it is photographing  Mr. Straub has come close to purging the screen of anything to see. At the same time, he will come close to purging the movie theater of anybody to watch.Some kind of anchorite ideal is being approached here: a motionless screen in an empty theater with angry, monotone voices on the soundtrack reading out pamphlets to music.Some people  more in Europe than herefervently admire Mr. Straub for his aridity. Dryness in our still lush and overnourished civilization can seem a virtue. ""Aaron and Moses,"" which will be shown at Lincoln Center this afternoon and Tuesday night as Mr. Straub's entry in the New York Film Festival, is one great Sahara.It is a filmed version of the atonal opera by Arnold Schoenberg, whose work was attacked in its day for uncompromising severity and even now is rarely whistled. Schoenberg, considering himself no minor prophet, modeled Moses upon himself. In the opera his Moses stands for the gaunt, unadorned religious Idea, conveyed solely through words and without images. Aaron argues that a living people needs imagesthe Golden Calf, for instanceand other aids to be able to grasp and fulfill the Idea.The opera is about the conflict. Schoenberg uses his technique to reinforce it: Aaron's tenor has musical phrases to sing; Moses' bass keeps to an atonal sung speech.Mr. Straub too seems to identify with Moses the image-breaker. He uses his cinema techniques in an attempt to reinforce the musical effect sought by Schoenberg. The first section, where Moses is present, is almost without motion. Moses' opening, lasting nearly five minutes, is rendered by the camera's fixing itself on the back of the singer's head. When he enlists Aaron, a second lengthy scene is done with the two men performing simultaneously, the camera merely showing them face to face.The Chosen People is represented by the Chorus of the Austrian Radio standing in a motionless block, like workers posing for pictures at a factory picnic. At times the screen goes blank or black for minutes on end, allowing the tiny light flaws skipping across to make up one of the film's visual high points.When Moses is up on the mountain and Aaron is in charge, the figures move a bit more. The Golden Calf is set up, there is a bit of dancing and a tiny orgy. It is done in detached, drugged fashion, with deliberate pictorial dullness.Dullness can be a statement, and in the case of Mr. Straub, whose control of his material is not in doubt, it obviously is. (The one major nondeliberate error is the subtitles. With so much emphasis on the singing and talking, and nothing much else happening, they assume a major importance. They are so bad, so Germanic, that sometimes it seems that this is a movie about present participles.)The reason for making dullness into a statement is less clear. But it seems to amount to a radical rejection of the successive cinematic fashions that generally try to heighten or vary the image, not to deaden it.Mr. Straub is making a minimal film, in other words, the equivalent of minimal painting. It is an antimovie and this would be fine except, maybe, for the people who go see it. Could they get in, perhaps, with anti-money?",1975-10-05T05:00:00+0000

One reason, says Arvin Brown, artistic director of New Haven's Long Wharf Theater, is that Fitch was the reigning American playwright of the early 1900's. So The House of Mirth, Fitch's adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel, will be part of the Long Wharf's upcoming season. Nor is the Long Wharf alone in its attention to early American drama. Plays by George M. Cohan and William Gillette are being dusted off in Cleveland and Los Angeles, respectively. Langdon Mitchell's The New York Idea, which first saw the light of Broadway in 1906, will be revived by the McCarter Theater Company of Princeton, N.J., which is also preparing a production of The Royal Family, by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber. In addition, theatergoers around the country will be seeing revivals of works by Eugene O'Neill, Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Robert Lowell and Edward Albee. And the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is well into its American Bicentennial Theater series.

But: There is another type of hero in the complex Japanese tradition, a man whose career usually belongs to a period of unrest and warfare and represents the very antithesis of an ethos of accomplishment. He is the man whose singleminded sincerity will not allow him to make the maneuvers and compromises that are so often needed for mundane success. During the early years his courage and verve may propel him rapidly upwards, but he is wedded to the losing side and will ineluctably be cast down. Flinging himself after his painful destiny, he defies the dictates of convention and common sense, until eventually he is worsted by his enemy, the successful survivor, who by his ruthlessly realistic politics manages to impose a new, more stable order on the world. Faced with defeat, the hero will typically take his cwn life in order to avoid the indignity of capture, vindicate his honor and make a final assertion of his sincerity. His death is no temporary setback which will he redeemed by his followers, but represents an irrevocable collapse of the cause he has championed: in practical terms the struggle has been useless and, in many instances, counterproductive.",1975-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: British 'Conduct Unbecoming':Film of the Hit Play Is Taut and Polished Army Officer Is Tried in Victorian India,"Like some wines, ""Conduct Unbecoming"" travels well. Barry England's play about a messy officers' mess in Victorian India was a hit in London before landing on Broadway five years ago, and it has lost none of its flavor in the British-made movie that opened yesterday at the Baronet. Dealing with a scandalous mystery exposed in a trial at a frontier army post, it is largely a suspenseful period piece that lovingly recalls and jibes at Hollywood's India as seen in the likes of ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer.""Michael Anderson, the director (""Around the World in 80 Days,"" etc.), shot ""Conduct"" in Pakistan with enough scarlet-coated officers and mountainous backgrounds to satisfy the ""Lancer"" fans. But the play and Robert Enders's devoted adaptation are concerned mostly with dissecting officers who are not precisely gentlemen and their shibboleths of regimental pomp, ceremony and special codes of honor.A newly arrived junior officer is accused of assaulting the pretty, flirtatious widow of the regiment's revered hero. The kangaroo tribunal wants to get the beastly matter over with quickly. The officer an dthe callow subaltern directed to defend him have inherited regimental traditions as sons of illustrious officers. But there's a twist. The accused has never wanted any part of either defending the empire or army traditions, while his timorous but tenacious advocate sees them as shining ideals.Of course, his persistent investigation reveals more than the innocence of his client and the actual culprit. It projects some expert play acting that shatters those ideals. Yet it still clings affectionately to the colorful, if old-fashioned, views of the pig-sticking, drinking (but very proper) thin red line of resolute cavaliers who held those rebel tribesmen off at the Khyber Pass in 1878.Michael York is genuinely appealing as the indomitable defender torn between his ""bourgeois principles"" of honor and integrity and the hollow men he sees mocking them. James Faulkner is properly cynical as the innocent defendant, and Susannah York is decorative and distraught as the allegedly wronged woman.As the sole American in the cast, Stacy Keach is convincingly British in a strong stint as the trial's presiding adjutant, whose rigid beliefs are changed by the evidence. Trevor Howard, as the bewhiskered, beloved colonel determined to maintain the honor of the regiment he is soon to leave, and Christopher Plummer and Richard Attenborough, as senior officers contributing to its dishonor, effectively delineate both the hypocrisy and the fierce pride of their lite group.In a nuclear age, ""Conduct Unbecoming"" may seem a somewhat quaint view of a romantic past. But its taut construction, mounting tension and polished performances make for a fascinating entertainment.",1975-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"Marguerite Duras's 'India Song,' a Four-Hankie Story","Marguerite Duras's new film is titled ""India Song"" but it might be more accurately called ""Leprosy,"" since leprosy provides the film with its most vivid metaphors. ""Lepers,"" someone explains early on, ""burst like sacks of grain,"" almost happily or, at least, without pain.So too bursts poor, elegant Anne-Marie Stretter (Delphine Seyrig), the promiscuous wife of the French Ambassador in Calcutta in the mid nineteen-thirties. Anne-Marie has what is variously diagnosed as leprosy of the soul and leprosy of the heart, which is a fancy way of saying she's bored out of her skull with her hus-band, with her lover, with all of her would-be lovers, and the members of Calcutta's diplomatic corps who live, like lepers, cut off from the life of the India that surrounds them.Anne-Marie doesn't have the good grace to blow up on the screen, and thus add a touch of melodrama to the otherwise static ""India Song."" She simply walks into the sea, off-screen, her soul and heart having burst simultaneously. So it goes in this kind of romantic nonsense that isn't too different in essential content from the four-hankie movies of the nineteen-thirties and forties.""India Song"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival tonight at 6:15 and again Friday night at 9:30.Miss Duras is a writer of fascinating novels and screenplays (""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"") but I've yet to see a film directed by her that didn't seem a carefully thought out, overly intellectualized mistake. ""India Song,"" based on an as-yet unproduced play commissioned by Peter Hall for the British National Theater, is no content and all style, some of it quite beautiful.Most of the so-called action takes place in a corner of the drawing room of the French Embassy in Calcutta, where we see Anne-Marie, usually in a stunning red evening dress, dancing with her lover, her suitors and finally with the mysterious French Vice Consul from Lahore (Michel Lonsdale), who has been sent to Calcutta in disgrace. One night he apparently had the bad manners to start shooting at the beggars and cats in the garden below his residence.None of this information comes to us directly. There is, in fact, no synchronized dialogue in the film. Instead the images are attached to disembodied voices, mostly those of embassy guests but sometimes those of Anne-Marie and the Vice Consul, who tell us in gossipy terms the terrible scandals Anne-Marie has been involved in, as well as (near the start of the film), the bad end she came to.The irritating thing about the film (which may well be consciously effected is that the characters do seem interesting in a terribly distant sort of way. The movie looks and sounds like something shot underwater, that is, everything except the fine, schlocky, thirties musical score by Carlos d'Alessio, which gives the film a life that has been carefully drained from the individual performances.Miss Seyrig is marvelous to contemplate, as the camera does endlessly, reminding us from time to time of a somewhat patrician version of Rita Hayworth, back in the days when she was making stuff like ""Gilda."" ""India Song,"" at its mushy center, isn't very different.",1975-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,A 'French Provincial' Jeanne Moreau,"Jeanne Moreau has a genius for the particular. She could be marched off for execution and her fretful gait, her expression, her silences would argue so strongly against any mere universal application of law that the firing squad would fall apart arguing.In ""French Provincial"" the young director Andr Tchin has sent Miss Moreau trundling down a long, heavily furnished corridor of a movie about the multigenerational rise and fall of a French bourgeois family. By no subtle extension it argues through its particular provincial setting the decline and dissolution of bourgeois France.Miss Moreau implants all kinds of cross-rhythms in Mr. Tchin's ponderous though talented work, with its air of a nineteenth-century novel. She arrests the predictable playing-out of his cards; she enhances his uneven strengths.""French Provincial,"" which will be shown tonight and tomorrow at Lincoln Center, is set around the fortunes of a family-owned foundry in a small French town. It was founded by Pedret, a young immigrant from Spain who by hard work and a driving vision built it up out of a simple smithy, and married the daughter of a prosperous local family as well.This is told in flashback. Most of the film takes place when Pedret has become the family patriarch, running the business with his three grown sons and dominating the life of the town. One trenchant scene shows the family going to the local movie theater in the same hierarchial fashion that an English squire and his family would go to church.Sturdy as one of his iron boilers, bearded and mystically devoted to the foundry, old Pedret represents for Tchin the vitality the bourgeoisie once had. The three sons, in different ways, are the class in decadence.There are two marriages. One brings in Rgina, a cold, spoiled girl who nests in the family like a leech, and eventually runs off with an American soldier. The other brings in Berthe, the town laundry woman.Berthe  Jeanne Moreauis vital, passionate and strong. She has an affair with Hector, most likable of the three sons, and when the family intervenes, threatens to leave town.Miss Moreau flickers fiercely, unpredictably, a hawk who lets herself be caught. Take one scene, for example. She has been snubbed by the family, and her laundry business is being boycotted.We see her in her kitchen, making herself dinner. She beats the omelet, muttering banal phrases on the lines of ""It will pass,"" ""What's the difference?"" She chops salad, she pours wine. Each action is like assembling a bomb. The bomb goes off. In a magnificent Moreanuvian reversal she suddenly sweeps out  abandoning omelet, salad and wine  goes to the foundry, and rallies Hector to defy his family.Old Pedret can't afford to lose Hector, who is the works manager, so he pragmatically decides they must marry. The lesson: The bourgeoisie will co-opt members of the proletariat when necessary.Berthe is new blood: when Pedret dies she takes over. Emotionally she is of the peopleat the film's start she gets a job for Pierre, who will eventually lead the workers in strike against herbut she is pulled unwillingly away. Only during the warwhen she drives a munitions truck for the resistance group run by Pierredoes some of the old emotional unity come back. As did France's.The war ends. She, not Pierre, gets a medal. Pierre, the militant union man, is won over to the bland new European style of worker-management cooperation. But the foundry itself is going under, in competition with big multinational firms. Only American money can save it. It comeswith Regina and her American lover who also happens to be a big businessman. At the end we see Regina and the American making love under the portrait of old Pedret.By this time the movie has collapsed under the increasingly coarse style that Tchin adopts to symbolize his thesis of capitalist collapse. It isn't helped by the fact that his Americans, speak English with grotesque French and German accents and look like something out of Krokodil.Miss Moreau lies helplessly in bed. She can do no more to save the foundry: It will probably go on, but it won't be hers or even French. On the other hand, she has almost saved the movie.",1975-10-09T05:00:00+0000

The camera speeds up after a bit, but the picture never does. It is long, stilted, self-conscious, badly acted and boring. Apart from that, there is little to recommend itMade by the people who made the vastly successful ""Billy Jack"" movies, it is a dim and grandiloquent account of how one group of the oppresseda Mexican ranch family overtaken by the United States acquisition of California  massacres another group of the oppressedthe Indians.It is done, of all reasons, to get hold of the Indians' gold in order to pay United States taxes. From the standpoint of the crack-brained brand of mystical individualism preached in the Billy Jack pictures, taxes would seem to be a wicked thing and one is to feel sympathy for the desperate lengths to which the Mexicans are driven as well as for the Indians.Not too much sympathy, though. Up rides the Master Gunfighterplayed by Tom Laughlin, who also played Billy Jackand ends up massacring just about everyone in sight. He does it as much with a sword as with his 12-shooter revolvereven the revolver is exaggeratedand he does it reluctantly, sighing. With each sigh, about 17 people perish.After avenging the dead Indians and preventing a second massacre he literally rides off into the sunset followed by his wife, who happens to be one of the few survivors of the Mexican ranch family.The sword fighting seems to be patterned on stylized Japanese movements. The dialogue sounds as if someone had translated it from the Japanese, too.

W. Griffith Theater) with approximately four of its more scatalogical minutes removed. The excision makes the film easier to sit throughless aggressively idiosyncratic  while the over-all work remains a courageous example of a personal kind of film making that, to me, leads nowhere.""Sweet Movie,"" like Mr. Makavejev's ""WR: Mysteries of the Organism,"" is a collage movie, with a structure that its producers describe as ""open and nonauthoritarian . . . made up of nonverbal elements."" This is a fairly intimidating way of saying that if you find it heavy-handed, obscure, unfunny, boring, self-indulgent and not terribly stimulating on any level, there's something wrong with you, not the movie.For a film so full of concern for the political and social sanity of man. ""Sweet Movie"" is, paradoxically, litist. If one doesn't share Mr. Makavejev's knowldege of the history of Communism and Reichian psychology, much of it is incomprehensible.What are comprehensible are the two intercut lines of visual action, both having the style of political cartoons. The first follows the farcical adventures of a Miss Canada (Carole Laure) who is married by Mr. Kapital (John Vernon), discarded by him when she objects to the manner in which he gets his sexual kicks, then is subjected to numerous fates worse than death and, when last seen, is being dunked in a vat full of chocolate syrup for a TV commercial.The second, which is much more vivid, furious and compellingis a political metaphor: a barge named the Survival, which carries a huge, papier-mach likeness of Karl Marx on its prow, steams through the canals of a European city. Its captain (Anna Prucanl) stands on Marx's brow, luring innocents abroad. Her principal victim is a young, ever-optimistic sailor (Pierre Clementi) off the Potemkin, whom she eventually destroys.As Mr. Makavejev has brilliantly demonstrated in his earlier films  particularly ""Man Is Not a Bird""he can make films of comparatively conventional form if he wants to. Now he obviously doesn't want to. This independence of spirit is laudable, but when it involves the large amounts of money that apparently went into ""Sweet Movie,"" it begins to seem decadent. Too much money is being spent for the benefit of the few.""Sweet Movie"" rolls around in foodmostly sugar, eggs, milk, chocolate syrupto such an extent that one's mind wanders from the intellectual concerns of the director to the logistics of the film making. When Miss Prucanl and Mr. Clementi make love in a bed full of sugar, one forgets the metaphor and starts to worry about how they got all that sticky stuff off after the scene was shot. On two occasions male actors urinate onscreen, once in a close-up. Is this real or were some sort of devices used?When the audience begins to wonder how an effect was achieved instead of why it has been done, a film's claim to seriousness flies out the window. ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" made no such claims. ""Sweet Movie"" doesand fails.",1975-10-10T05:00:00+0000

Fancy it is, but hardly a flight.It is a tiny, potentially appealing weed of a picture, absurdly dragged down by a mass of post-Beatles rococo. For Mr. Russell, the shortest line between two points is a pretzel, preferably painted gold and doped.It is a pity. For the first half-hour or so, Mr. Russell's treatment of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner as the pop stars of their day is manic and extremely funny. Then it relapses into a noisy bit of pretentiousness in the manner of its predecessor, ""Tommy"": full of flashing lights, satin spacesuits, chrome-lucite furniture and mock agony.The opening scene with Lisztplayed by Roger Daltrey, the star of ""Tommy""making love to a countess to the beat of a rhinestone metronome is of limited appeal. But things improve when the count comes in. Liszt and his mistress are strapped inside a piano while the count gleefully pounds out one of the noisier Liszt pieces. ""Perhaps this will teach you not to bang on the piano,"" he chortles.The next scenes show Liszt, rendered in Mr. Daltrey's best Liverpudlian accents, at the height of his pop-star success. One takes place in a crowded musicians' cafe. Mendelssohn is putting down an admirer: ""Music, shmusic; it's a living."" Rossini circulates with a tray of chicken. ""Eat or you'll get sick,"" he tells Berlioz. Infantile, but it works.So does Liszt's concert scene. The place is packed with 19th-century groupies. Liszt strikes a chord, and he's mobbed by hundreds of berserk yellow bonnets.Then Liszt goes to Russia to look up one of his loves, the Princess Caroline, and the movie founders. There is a repulsive scene in her antechamber in which Liszt belts out a rock number while circled by some voracious-looking women. It culminates with a spidery Princess Caroline presiding over a feigned sexual mutilation involving an enormous plastic phallus.Nothing improves after that. Richard Wagner appears as Liszt's arch-rival, a kind of Nazi Antichrist, with his own groupie cult. Lisztby this time he has become a priestis sent by the Popeplayed by Ringo Starrto destroy him.Liszt breaks into Wagner's turreted castle and does him in by playing ""Liebestraum"" at him on a fire-belching piano. Before Wagner dies, however, he creates a Nazi Frankenstein's monster, and it takes Liszt, in a celestial rocket ship, accompanied by all his mistresses, to destroy it.To the degree one chooses to find symbolism in all this, it is ludicrous. Equating Wagner's music with Nazism in this fashion is absurdly simplistic. It is even more absurd to set up Liszt's music as some kind of counterforce to Wagner's, let alone one that is capable of overbearing it.Now it can be argued that Mr. Russell, with all his dazzle, is not intending, but aping symbolism. Or that he is not so much being pretentious as mocking pretention. Try mocking a quicksand by somersaulting artistically into it: The rate at which you sink is just the same, and only your closest admirers will be interested in pulling you out.",1975-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Lester's 'Royal Flash' Opens,"Harry Flashman is not quite a scoundrel. He is, rather, a hero who is thoroughly, irretrievably flawed. He lies and cheats. He's chicken-hearted. He's vain. When the going gets tough and the tough get going, Harry flees or, if all exits are closed to him, he hides. When caught, he cries. Once, during a battle in the Crimean War, when his side was losing, Harry almost broke his neck trying to surrender. The thing about Harry is that whatever he does, he does hard.As played with fine, manic intensity by Malcolm Mc-Dowell in Richard Lester's new comedy, ""Royal Flash,"" Harry can't even smile straight. The corners of his mouth go up in the expected fashion but in the middle of it there's a misplaced leer. Ever optimistic, Harry keeps his leer at the ready, even though he's the sort who loses when playing strip poker with a girl.Harry Flashman is good comic company and ""Royal Flash,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet, is good comic fun. The screenplay is by George MacDonald Fraser, based on his novel about the adventures of the young English Army officerpart rogue, part twitwho romances Lola Montez and finds himself up to his neck in Bismarck's schemes to unite the German princely states.Though ""Royal Flash"" is set in the mid-19th century, the manners and morals look very much like those of Mr. Lester's ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers,"" the two films he made out of the Dumas novel with screenplays by Mr. Fraser.If the seams between the gags are beginning to show in ""Royal Flash,"" and if the pace seems occasionally a little less than breathless, it may be due as much to our expectations ofand our familiarity withthe Lester method as to any lack of invention on the part of the film makers.Mr. Lester throws away more gags in ""Royal Flash"" than some comedy directors think up in an entire career. Now and then you wish he'd take time to develop a routine a little more, to give it a classic beginning, a middle and an end, instead of rushing on to the next sequence. He is profligate with his talents, which is, of course, very much a part of the method of any Lester comedy.Another part is the impeccable casting. Charlton Heston was never better in ""Ben-Hur"" than he was as Cardinal Richelieu in the ""Musketeers"" films. There are no plums of such size in ""Royal Flash,"" though Mr. McDowell is very good, and actors like Alan Bates, Oliver Reed and Florinda Bolkan give the enterprise heft it might otherwise lack.One typical Lester sequence: Lola Montez (Miss Bolkan) dances before Ludwig of Bavaria, who is enchanted with her, though not as history has told us, because of her shape or her beauty. Giggling with pleasure, he asks, ""Are they real?"" Being mad, Ludwig means the cardboard spiders that she uses as props in her dance. It's low-comedy and almost nonstop.",1975-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Sidecar Racers',"Australia may be photogenic, its young men may be daring, and speeding motorcycles can be thrilling, but ""Sidecar Racers,"" which roared into local theaters Wednesday is merely scenic and noisy about its racers and their cycles. Aside from its uncommon views of the dangerous, Australian two-man sport of sidecar motorcycle racing, the film is familiar melodrama, no more exciting than its uninspired story and largely native cast.The script by an Australian novelist, Jon Cleary (""The Sundowners,"" etc.) involves a visiting American, Ben Murphy, playing a onetime Olympic swimming champion as the sidecar passenger who teams with an Australian cyclist, John Clayton, to win the big race. Naturally, there's also some offtrack romantic rivalry between them for Wendy Hughes, daughter of the other American in the cast, Peter Graves, playing a tire tycoon who makes a few token appearances before they all reach the finish line.Even though there are clashes between some tough guys and our heroes and a couple of tragic crashes, ""Sidecar Racers"" leans heavily on its thunderous racing footage, which eventually becomes a mite redundant. Although the handsome, boyish Mr. Murphy chooses to give up both his chances of glory and the girl to the dark, properly resentful Mr. Clayton, they both emerge as sincere but slightly sophomoric figures. Miss Hughes, however, appears to be a spoiled, indecisive prize, hardly worth all their wrangling.Under Earl Bellamy's pedestrian direction, Australia is colorful but hardly worth the trip, even in those rocketing racers.",1975-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,The Disposal of Liberty And Other Industrial Wastes,"Edgar Z. Friedenberg has always had a fondness for aristocracy, and it is not surprising that in his latest book he finds kind words for Charles I, Haile Selassie and the King of Thailand. Of course, Friedenberg is not himself an aristocrat. Like H. L. Mencken, that earlier admirer of the Elite, Friedenberg is an impeccably bourgeois intellectual who has made something of a career excoriating the booboisie to the delight of an equally middleclass intelligentsia. Both Mencken and Friedenberg allow their readers, and themselves, a kind of social disclaimer, as attacks on the average man put social distance between the critic and them. But these critics often protest too much; their assaults on the ordinary citizen are too angry and too involved to reflect aristocratic detachment. Such socalled higher men, Nietzsche wrote, are driven by selfhatred, selfdoubt and a desperate desire for attentionthey are fatally bound to the things they affect to disdain. Mencken, who admired Nietzsche with a rather boneheaded devotion, predictably missed that point, but his political thoughtshallow, contradictory and muddleheadedis evidence for Nietzsche's argument.

But ""Lies My Father Told Me,"" the Canadian-made comedy drama that arrived at the Paris Theater yesterday, makes its bittersweet nostalgia pleasurable without cloying aftereffects.Ted Allan's dramatization of remembrances of his own Jewish family in the Montreal melting pot of a half-century ago is brought appealingly alive with the aid of Jan Kadar's perceptive direction and some strong, natural performances.Father, mother, relatives and neighbors are important but not nearly as central to this memoir as 7-year-old David Herman and his bearded, Tevyalike, junkman grandfather (Zaida). They form a mutual admiration society that also includes Ferdeleh, the ancident nag that draws grandfather's creaking wagon (along with a happy David on Sundays) through slum backyard alleys and rich wooded areas in quest of castoffs.Grandfather's orthodox religious beliefs are transmitted to the loving youngster through parables and tall tales. If he accepts them and his Zaida on adoring, ingenuous faith, he is also confused and shattered by the reality of an irascible father, who is a failed inventor of creaseless pants and the like and is constantly seeking loans from the old man for pie-in-the-sky schemes.Of course, the teeming neighborhood scene's varied characters touch on and color the family's life. There are the local young prostitute, a friend of the clients and local kids, who is stridently done by Carole Lazare; the boy's truly doll-like little confidante-playmate, Cleo Paskal, and a gently argumentative Marxist tailor, portrayed to the manner born by the film's author.And there's a termagant housewife, played in vixenish style by Barbara Chilcott, whose complaints about grandfather's stable, its smells and the horse manure David spreads on her backdoor lead to the seriocomic denouement.A properly distraught performance by Marilyn Lightstone of David's hard-pressed young mother illuminates the tension of maintaining allegiances to her son, husband and father. And Len Birman's portrait of the luckless would-be inventor-husband is both brash and pitiable.Dominating the largely Canadian cast is the veteran Israeli actor Yossi Yadin, in a forceful yet tender delineation of the grandfather. His unwavering faith in ancient religious tenets is equal to his love of his grandson and his resigned but wise acceptance of his son-in-law's inadequacies. As the wide-eyed grandson, a newcomer, Jeffrey Lynas, reflects love, innocence, sibling rivalry and the ultimate shock of his grandfather's death with childlike but genuine conviction.The clashes between the grandfather and the father leave no doubts as to the boy's allegiance. And Mr. Kadar, the Czechoslovak director best known for his memorable ""The Shop on Main Street,"" is equally pointed in his affection and professionalism. ""Lies My Father Told Me"" (actually the harsh truths the boy cannot understand or accept) may be somewhat sentimental and quaint in its Jewish rituals and traditions. But under Mr. Kadar's sensitive guidance, this journey back to lost youth modestly but touchingly reveals people as authentic as the settings in which they are captured.",1975-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Truffaut's 'Adele' Ends Film Festival,"In 1863 Adle Hugo, the younger daughter of the great French poet and patriot, Victor Hugo, ran away from home on the Isle of Guernsey where her father was living in exile to follow a young English officer, a Lieutenant Pinson, to his new post in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lieutenant Pinson was probably not a bad sort, not worse than most, but he wasn't very serious.It's thought that the young, inexperienced Adle had most likely been Lieutenant Pinson's mistress for a short time on Gurnsey, and it's known that she wanted desperately to marry him, though her father disapproved. In any case, Lieutenant Pinson was not interested  a circumstance that Adle was ill-equipped to understand or ever to support.""The Story of Adle H.,"" Franois Truffaut's profoundly beautiful new film, is about Adle's journey, taken with measured steps, into a magnificent, isolating obsession, first to frozen Halifax and then, when Lieutenant Pinson is transferred to the West Indies, to Barbados, where Adle sweeps through the tropical streets and alleys of Bridegtown talking to herself, wearing a heavy black cloak, and looking like some mad, benign witch of the north.Unable to cope with the truth, and using her imagination and her feelings as carefully as someone writing a piece of fiction, Adle created another world where she became Lieutenant Pinson's wife, where love was her religion (and no humiliation too great a sacrifice), and where she kept a coded journal, only recently deciphered. It is this journal that is the basis for Mr. Truffaut's most severe, most romantic meditation upon love.""The Story of Adle H."" was shown last night at Avery Fisher Hall to close the 13th New York Film Festival, which, despite one spectacular disappointment and several others of a lesser order, has been one of the best festivals in recent years. Without question the Truffaut entry was the surprising highlight, even to one who has admired the French director's films over the years.One of the fascinations of the Truffaut career is in watching the way he circles and explores different aspects of the same subjects that dominate almost all of his films. However, ""The Story of Adle H.,"" impeccably photographed by Nestor Almendros (""The Wild Child""), looks and sounds like no other Truffaut film you've ever seen.The colors are deep, rich and often dark, and the soundtrack is full of the noises that one associates with old costume films produced by M-G-M in its great dayscarriages riding over cobblestones, pens scratching across vellum, servants arriving and departing with important messages, bells that tinkle over the doors of bookshops. More important, there is the fine background score by the late Maurice Jaubert (he died in 1940), who composed for Vigo and Clair among others. The film has the manner of a romance but it's a romance from which all the conventional concerns have been eliminated.In the single-minded way in which the movie sticks to its subject, ""The Story of Adle H."" reminds one of ""The Wild Child."" It's virtually a one-character film. It contemplates the classic beauty of Adle, played with extraordinary grace by 20-year-old Isabelle Adjani of the Comdie Franaise, much as Catherine Deneuve was admired by the camera in ""Mississippi Mermaid,"" and it appreciates the particularity of women in a fashion that recalls the erratic journey of Catherine to the crematorium in ""Jules and Jim.""""The Story of Adle H."" is not a psychiatric case history, though all the facts seem to be there if one wants to accept it as such. Rather it's a poet's appreciation of the terrifying depth of Adle's feelings, which, early on, drive her to lying to her family, to making life miserable for Lieutenant Pinson in Halifax (including canceling his engagement to someone else), to spying on him, happily, as he makes love to another woman. She's willful and spoiled and, the film understands, impossible to deal with. Yet the film makes us see both the madness and the grandeur of the passion.It's this ability to allow us to see a subject from several different angles simultaneously that often proves most unsettling in a Truffaut film. Toughness and compassion get all mixed up. It's also this talent that separates his films from those of all other directors who are working in the humanist tradition today. ""The Story of Adle H."" is a film that I suspect Jean Renoir would much admire. He understands such things.",1975-10-13T05:00:00+0000

That requires great strength of character on the part of the manager and his coaches, said Lefty Gomez, who studied human nature with the Yankees of Joe McCarthy's time up.

Well, of course, one muttered to oneself, rape is awful, deplorable, an unalloyed tarnish on the human condition. But so are cancer, forest fires, and the sundry other disasters that people have been heir to ever since they evolved from whatever species preceded them. What could one possibly do about rape, except to deplore it? And what, aside from the fact that most perpetrators of rape are male (though their victims are not necessarily female) does rape really have to do with women's liberation? One might as plausibly wage war on murder under the banner of human liberation. Would some one be kind enough to explain? Well, at long last, in her exhaustive and detailed study, Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape, the journalist and feminist Susan Brownmiller has attempted to. explain, and by degrees one grasps what she is driving at, what all who have made rape an issue of feminism are driving at.

It is the avant-garde that dies first.The point is evoked with eerie precision at a collection of four short films being shown by Film Forum to inaugurate its new premises at the Vandam Theater in SoHo. The four, all made in the nineteen-fifties, were considered more or less experimental in their day. All are interesting and two, at least, are masterpieces. But seen now, with many of their varying techniques having become familiar, the stylistic effect is a blend of charm and naivet.In fact their real impact, and it has almost the force of shock, is not in their style but in their viewpoint.All four are in some way about New York. What stands out is the buoyancy, the sheer optimism and exuberance that this city, 20 years ago, imposed even upon those who were out to set it on its collective ear. The pictures will be shown today through Sunday and again next Thursday through Sunday.If ""On the Road"" was the bible of the Beat Generation, the film ""Pull My Daisy"" was a kind of short breviary. With a voice-over narration by Jack Kerouac and the manic participation of Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Peter Orlovsky and others, it takes the more or less formal setting of a social call and tears it into shreds.The setting is a loft somewhere south of Greenwich Village. Lofts were still symbols of freedom and boundlessness: bodies with needle marks or stab wounds hadn't begun to turn up in them. It was littered with clothes: litter was still a statement and not a universal condition. A Tiffany lamp hung in it: Tiffany lamps were still found in junkshops and hadn't made their way uptown.For the Beats the seamless stability of American life was like a field just snowed on, in which almost any kind of caper would leave a significant mark. So in ""Daisy"" Messrs. Ginsberg, Orlovsky and Corso, laden with beer cans bounce into the residence of Milo, a seraphic brakeman, and his long-suffering wife.The three poets are young, their hair is slept-in but short, and they sit on Milo's couch like ruffled owls while sabotaging the visit of the Bishop and his mother and sister. The bishop is only about 17: still, he manages such lines as ""A strange and interesting evening"" while the air is full of talk about ""tortured socks"" and a short oratorio about cockroaches.This is Dada: maximum shock with a minimum of pain; the feeling that stones could be hurled through windows and nothing would really break. Like Dada from the nastier perspective of the late nineteen-twenties, it seems innocent and touching.""Skyscraper,"" made by Shirley Clarke, is a short film classic; a funny, exciting and absorbing account of the building of a skyscraper from demolition to completion.We see old facades coming down and a great hole gouged out by power shovels, and with a sudden sense of time-warp we realize that what we see as not being deprecated or condemned but celebrated. A lilting voice sings about ""this island, light as wine."" Change is presented as triumph not loss, and the city is a place of limitless energies and possibilities.Using a dialogue between Murphya high-steel man who is the wisecracking, know-it-all New Yorker and totally capable of astonishmentand his boss, the entire process of building a skyscraper is laid out. The camera shows bedrock being hauled away""They're taking New York to New Jersey,"" Murphy protestsfoundations laid, steel uprights swinging into place.The bare girders frame towering views of Manhattan. The facade is laid on and, curiously, as the building is finished it becomes less real. The irony is unmeant and is only seen now in retrospect. Because all this romance, guts and imagination, all this high-flying geometry went to produce the gimcrack banality of Fifth Avenue's Tishman Building.The other two films are less thematic: they are poetic and affectionate explorations of the beauty of the city. ""N.Y., N.Y."" by Francis Thompson uses optical effectsmultiple images, distortion, color-blurring  to find geometric patterns in the city's bones. A morning cup of coffee is serialized into infinity; bridge-girders zigzag, framing the sky like stained glass.A much better picture, the best of the four, in fact, is Weegee's New York, particularly its Coney Island section. Made by the photographer Weegee, it follows the day and evening through a crowded Coney Island Sunday.",1975-10-17T05:00:00+0000

Stage a costume party where the inmates come as catatonic Pierrots, deranged Columbines and 15-foot giants and film it through gauze to drugged music. Let the star act at the party be a mime show where the actors, also inmates, sag sadly at one another.If I haven't lost count, Mauro Bolognini has managed to mount a metaphor upon a second metaphor that is mounted, in turn, upon a third metaphor. All were exhausted to begin with: Is he trying to kill them? He shouldn't, because he will undoubtedly want to use them again.""Down the Ancient Stairs."" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, puts Marcello Mastroianni in the role of Professor Bonaccorsi, chief psychiatrist at the asylum. It is a Mastroianni role in that he is the lover of the wives of the asylum's director and surgeon and of one of the nurses. It also works up the actor's bent for being gloomy about it, as a man might be gloomy between bouts of compulsive overeating.Professor Bonaccorsi's satyriasishe fondles the patients as well as his colleaguesis metaphysical. He is obsessed with insanity: with establishing that there is indeed a difference between himself and the patients. At the asylum he sets himself up as a kind of godlike figure, running everything, holding off everyonestaff and patients  with busyness and with a show, often a physical show, of love.Into this closed world comes Anna Bersani, a young woman doctor played by Franoise Fabian. She resists Bonaccorsi's advances, she questions his methods. To nail down his insistence that there is a clear demarcation between the sane and insane, Bonaccorsi keeps searching for a physical determinant of insanity.One day he finds it, or thinks he does. He peers through his microscope, he exults. Insanity is a hairy splotch, he announces, appearing on the blood cells. Dr. Bersani checks the experiment and finds it is flawed.Bonaccorsi quits the hospital and gets on a train. But it is Italy of the nineteen-thirties, and the compartment is full of raving Fascists. Not only is there no difference between the inmates and the staff in the asylum, Bolognini suggests, but there is also no difference between the asylum and the rest of the world.It is relentlessly weary stuff; an image so venerable, a paradox so frequently trotted out that it has lost all its original force.Mr. Mastroianni, Miss Fabian and the actresses playing Bonaccorsi's mistresses perform routinely. The pace is leaden, the dialogue ridiculous.",1975-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Recycled 'Rooster Cogburn':Wayne and Hepburn in 'True Grit' Spin-Off Eccentric Chase Turns Into Cheerful Comedy,"""Rooster Cogburn,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is a high-class example of the low Hollywood art of recyclingtaking bits and pieces of old stories and characters and making from them other movies that can never be described as completely new or fresh.For John Wayne, who has the title role, ""Rooster Cogburn"" is a continuation of the part he played in ""True Grit,"" the film for which he was awarded his first (and fully deserved) Oscar. For Katharine Hepburn the film recalls her marvelous characterization opposite Humphrey Bogart in ""The African Queen."" The role of Eula Goodnight, the pastor's spinsterish Bible-quoting daughter in ""Rooster Cogburn,"" is a lighthearted spin-off of the earlier role, but the important word here is lighthearted, not spin-off.Miss Hepburn has been too long glum in her recent films. It's good to see her looking as if she were having a lark for a change. Good causes (""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"") and art (""The Trojan Women"") are all well and good, but too much of that sort of thing can get even a good woman down.In ""Rooster Cogburn,"" Miss Hepburn has a roaring good timeso convincingly that you come to accept the movie on its own terms. It's a cheerful, throwaway Western, featuring two stars of the grand tradition who respond to each other with verve that makes the years disappear.In this new film you remember with immense pleasure instead of regret the Hepburn of the great Cukor films of the nineteen-thirties, forties and fifties. The comedienne has not disappeared, only the good roles.Martin Julien's screenplay for ""Rooster Cogburn,"" using the Rooster Cogburn character from ""True Grit,"" is hardly high comedy, but it gives Miss Hepburn and Mr. Wayne a number of decently funny lines and situations that Stuart Millar, formerly a producer, directs with goodhumored affection.Like ""True Grit,"" the new film is essentially an eccentric chase film: Rooster Cogburn, the pot-bellied, whiskysoaked, one-eyed old Federal marshal, is commissioned to track down a gang of desperados in the Arkansas territory. In the course of his journey he is more or less forced to take along the woman whose father has been murdered by the outlaw gang and a young Indian boy.That's all the story there is, or need be. What makes ""Rooster Cogburn"" so pleasant is the quality of the encounters between the marshal and Eula, who, it turns out, is a crack shot and not above lifting a watch from the body of a dead bandit over whom she's saying a solicitous prayer.Mr. Wayne, of course, has played this role before, and there are signswhen Miss Hepburn is off-screenthat it would run away from him were he left to his own devices. He mugs, pouts and gets very close to playing it in the cute manner of the very young and very old. When Miss Hepburn is with him, however, a sense of discipline is established that brings out the best in both of them.It's rather like one of the film's better scenes: Rooster, Eula and the Indian boy have stopped on the trail to rest and Rooster has taken the opportunity to get drunk, at which point he starts using their food for target practice. ""Shooting cornbread in a meadow,"" Eula reminds Rooster firmly, ""is not taking us anywhere.""When Miss Hepburn is not around, ""Rooster Cogburn"" is shooting cornbread in a meadow. Fortunately, she's on the screen most of the time.",1975-10-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"What's New in Animated Films? Sex, Gluttony and Computers:What's New in Animated Films?","Ralph Bakshi revived public interest in animation as a medium for the seventies with a trio of controversial cartoon features: ""Fritz the Cat,"" the first X-rated animated cartoon; ""Heavy Traffic,"" the first portrait of the artist as a young drawing; and ""Coonskin,"" which has been crusaded against by the Congress of Racial Equality as an animated racial slur.Whether you love Bakshi's films or hate themand you will have plenty of company in either campit must be admitted that the abrasive, innovative filmmaker has gotten audiences excited about the possibilities of animation in the seventies the way that Disney did in the thirties and forties with ""Snow White,"" the first feature-length cartoon, and ""Fantasia,"" his animated symphony concert.So what else is new in this frequently neglected medium? Well, among other things, a tug at the heart-strings by clay figures, a computer-assisted film about human beings, and the children's book illustrations of Maurice Sendak and Tomi Ungerer come to life. All this and more, as anyone who attended the Third International Animation Film Festival in New York at Columbia University can testify. Fred Mintz, director of the five-day festival which ended on Oct. 4, devised nine categories for the series, each defining a way in which animation can be used (for feature films, entertainment shorts, educational films, industrial films, films for children, films by students, television commercials, experimental films and computer films.)Although there were no feature films in competition in thisthe thirdNew York festival, audiences witnessed competition among 142 short films from 17 countries. Their techniques ranged from good old pencil and paper to clay to computer animation. Their subjects ranged from world hunger to the right of privacy to sexual fantasies.This year's festival winners were chosen by an international jury that included the animation directors Feodor Khytruk (Russia), Marcell Jankovics (Hungary), and Miroslav Kijowicz (Poland); Louise Beaudet, director of the Cinmathque Quebeoise in Canada; and Phil Kimmelman, who makes animated commercials in New York. The chairman of the jury was Frank Thomas of the Walt Disney Studio, one of the most important figures in the world history of animation who has helped bring to life such memorable characters as Bambi, the Lady and the Tramp, and the little rabbits in last year's ""Robin Hood."" Now, at 62, Thomas is helping to train the first post-Walt Disney group of young animators at the Disney Studio on the next Disney animated feature, ""The Rescuers."" When he was 24, Thomas achieved a break-through in animation toward the end of Disney's ""Snow White"" that most animators thought they would never see. When the dwarfs are gathered, sorrowing, at Snow White's bier, and Dopey breaks down and sobs in Doc's beard, members of the premiere audience actually wept. Cartoons had made audiences laugh for years, but never cry. For the first time in history, moving drawings had becomemoving drawings.It was a similar break-through that won for a film called ""Whazzat?"" the Grand Prix of this year's animation festival. Arthur P. Pierson of Chicago animated clay to retell an 11th-century Arabic folk tale about six blind men. In an amazing sceneamazing because it manages to communicate strong emotion with featureless clay figures and without dialoguethe six blind men try to cross a chasm. One of the little figures stretches itself across the chasm to make a bridge. Four of the others cross their pal (literally, not dishonorably), then wait on the other side for the last little guy to cross over. But he is immobilized by fear. So they hop up and down, urging him on. Finally, he tries, only to have the bridge collapse and leave him dangling over the chasm. Fortunately, the blind buddies on the cliff quickly haul him up and soon they are all jumping for joy.""This is the first time that I've seen clay animation communicate an emotion,"" said Thomas. ""Usually, you know what a character is doing; you may even, know what it's thinking; but you do not feel any emotion. 'Closed Mondays,' another clay film, got the Academy Award for animation last year, and it was like that. But Mr. Pierson has a group of six little characters, and though they don't have specific personalities, they have a group personality. When they're happy, you feel happy, when they're curious, you feel curious; and when they're apprehensive, you feel apprehension. And to get that out of little clay figuresand a group of themis either awfully lucky or pure genius.""The winner in the category of computer animation, ""Hunger,"" by Peter Foldes, is another triumph but one which uses a very different technique. Hungarian-born Foldes, 51, is a brilliant draftsman who has long been successful in translating his stark line drawings into the dimension of movement; but the computer gives these drawings an inhuman, flowing motion that perfectly suits his terrifying transformations. Foldes has learned to use a computer as another animation toollike a special kind of pencil. ""Hunger"" is the first fully animated figurative film ever made using computer techniques. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, it was made with a digital computer at the National Research Council of Canada, utilizing the programs that N. Burtnyk and M. Wein have developed there.In ""Hunger,"" Foldes takes a Dantesque view of modern gluttony, showing the metamorphosis of a slim, handsome young man into a grotesque and obese old man. When the old man dies of over-eating, he is cast bodily into hell, where his flesh is devoured by the spirits of those who have starved to death. In effect, the computer ""draws"" all the tedious drawings in between the extreme poses of an action, leaving Foldes free to concentrate on the key drawings.This year's student films reflected much more maturity and technical achievement than those entered in the first two festivals. The jury gave first prize to ""Roll 'Em, Lola,"" a sexual fantasy conceived and animated by Fred Surns of the University of Southern California, in which two high-powered automobiles chase each other around the nude body of a giant woman in a four-minute-thirty-second feast for the Jung at heart.The violation of the human right of privacy is the theme of ""Walls Have Ears,"" the surreal film directed by Poland's Andrej Ryska which won the prize in the festival's experimental film category. A terrible, ear-shaped protuberance grows out of the wall and drives a man insane before it is sliced off by a razor bladeonly to be replaced by a growth like an eyeball.The best example of the increasingly scarce ""story"" cartoon to be shown at the festival was ""The Heron and the Crane,"" a wry, Chekhovian animal fable told by I. Norstein and R. Kachanov of Russia. Gag cartoons are also less in evidence at animation festivals since the major Hollywood studios closed their cartoon department in the fifties and early sixties. And yet, the Eastern European animators, who have only recently caught up with all the Popeyes, Tom and Jerrys and Roadrunners made during and immediately after World War II, are trying hard to revive the pure gag cartoon. The biggest bellylaughs of the festival were heard during a six-minute cartoon from Pannonia Film Studio in Budapest called ""Let's Keep a Dog,"" which illustrated a number of arguments in favor of having a dog as a pet.""Because it is faithful unto death"" was Argument Number Seven, accompanied by the stereotype image of Man's Best Friend stretched out upon his master's grave. A comforting image until darkness falls, whereupon the dog suddenly leers, leaps up, and digs down into the grave for a bone. ""Let's Keep a Dog"" and ""The Heron and the Crane"" were the winners among entertainment filmsthe first in the six-minute and under category, the second in the category of shorts lasting more than six minutes.The best commercial was clearly ""Trans-Siberian Express"" from Richard Williams Animation in Londona studio which received a special award for the general high quality of its entries. Except for a brief pitch for Count Pushkin Vodka at the end, the commercial devotes its two minutes of screen time to an accelerating montage conjuring up a 10-day train journey from Moscow to Vladivostock. ""This was staggering art workreal impact!"" said jury chairman Thomas. ""And it's hard to get outstanding art work on the screen as you go into animationbecause to do a strong still drawing and then move it and keep that strength is very difficult."" The art work was done by Playboy cartoonist Rowland B. Wilson; it was moved by 23-year-old English animator Russell Hall; and it was edited by Art Babbitt, the man who made the mushrooms dance in Disney's ""Fantasia.""The problem of animating strong still drawings cropped up again in the category of children's film, where animated film versions of several respected children's books competed for the prize. ""We on the jury asked ourselves is it primarily a filmor is it just putting the book's illustrations on the screen?"" said Thomas. ""In the case of Maurice Sendak's 'Where the Wild Things Are,' we felt that the director, Gene Deitch, did not improve it by putting it on the screen. It was better as a book.""We gave the prize to 'The Beast of Monsieur Racine.' [Book written and illustrated by Tomi Ungerer; movie directed by Gene Deitch in Czechoslovakia for Weston Woods Studio, USA.] Deitch added elements of timing and staging that added a new dimension, which I think you have to do when you make a picture of a book, and it held up as a picture.""The trick is to keep the same style and plot content, while translating the written word into moving images with sound. This ""The Beast of M. Racine"" does admirably, while telling the story of a Frenchman who won't sell his prize pears to anyone, but suffers the misfortune of having them eaten by a strange beast. However, he manages to capture the beast and boasts: ""I lost my pears but I found a companion."" Now, people want to buy his beast. ""The beast is my friend,"" says M. Racine, ""and friends are not for sale.""But when he tries to show off his beastly friend at the National Academy of Science, a hoax is revealed: two children have been playing a trick on M. Racine by dressing up in a beast's skin. Undaunted, M. Racine adopts the children  and soon has ""a new crop of pears which he happily shared with his two young friends."" Summarized, it sounds goofy; visualizedas when M. Racine kisses his pears good night while crickets and frogs provide a little night musicit is charming.What was conspicuously missing from this year's competition was the art of personality animationthe ability to create characters with specific individual personalities, to put the spark of life into moving drawings so that pen-and-ink personages like The Three Pigs, the Seven Dwarfs or Fritz the Cat emerge on screen.There was only one such moment at the festival, and it occurred with an already established character. It happened during the showing of the animated title credits for the new Peter Sellers comedy. ""The Return of the Pink Panther."" Without a word of dialogue or a change of costume, the Pink Panther walked through the credits in six different waysand evoked six different personalities: Groucho Marx, Mickey Mouse, Charlie Chaplin, Frankenstein, a ballet dancer and a cowboy.To be sure, the animator for these lively ""Pink Panther"" credits was that veteran Bugs Bunny/Roadrunner animator, Ken Harris. But the director was the New Wave's Richard Williams, who won an Oscar in 1972 for a half-hour cartoon, edition of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" which brought the original 1843 John Leech illustrations to magical life. And now that Williams has financing for his full-length animated ""Raggedy Ann,"" we may hope for a new flowering of personality animation in 1976.John Culhane is a film historian and co-author of ""Noah's Animals,"" a forthcoming animated television special.",1975-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Four years later director Jose Quintero and actress Geraldine Page turned the tables on those who had too soon lamented the play's passing and displayed plainly, at Circle in the Square, its vibrant, heartbreaking life. Overnight it emerged as one of Williams's finest.

Or is it a step toward lifesaving knowledge?,"I can remember a situation in which a woman entered the hospital with a miscarriage. It was a case of spontaneous abortion, and she came in because she'd been told it was about to happen. The baby, however, was born alive. It weighed less than 500 grams, or just under a poundwhich was below the legal definition of a live birth (this was in Baltimore). No birth certificate was made out, therefore, and it wasn't legally born. Since it was alive, however, it was taken over to the premature unit where it survived for two days. Eventually, being at that very borderline weight, it did die. As it happened, the woman had given birth on Dec. 31; and so the two days of infant care had been during the first two days of the New Year. The parents, when they received the hospital bill. were unable to claim any tax deduction. The father was incensed and he took the position that since there never had been any legally born person'no birth certificate and no death certificatethey couldn't hold him responsible for the costs of treatment. Why should he be made to pay for the care of a child who had never even existed? The hospital, on its own part, was put in the odd position of having spent 48 hours treating an individual who wasn't even, technically speaking, born.

First and foremost, of course, there is Martha Graham but there are plenty of others, ranging from Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor, to Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, Alvin Ailey, Paul Sanasardo and Erick Hawkins; such varied freelancers as John Butler, Anna Sokolow and Donald McKayie; and such comparatively young choreographers as, say, Twyla Tharp, Manuel Alum and Dan Wagoner. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and is set down in no particular order I am merely trying to give some impression of the range of moderndance choreography, the sheer quantity of it. Why such abundance? Probably because modern dancers tend to be more dedicated, more devoted to their profession, than their classic ballet colleagues. And the reason is terribly simple. Most classic dancers have taken up dance before the age of ten; usually it was a decision made for them by their parents. They may love it, but they did not really choose itexcept in the manner that fiveyearold little Charlie might decide he would like to a fireman when he grows up. Now, modern dancers take up dancing far later, as a vocation, as a calling. Very often they take it up not merely because they want to dance, but because they want to create dances; they want, in fact, to choreograph. A girl in high school learning ballet wants to grow up to be Odette/Odile; a girl in college taking modern dance wants to grow to be Martha Graham.",1975-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Murky Whodunit:'Black Christmas' Is at Local Theaters,"""Black Christmas,"" which landed on local screens a year after its release in Canada where it was produced, is a whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.The answer is hard to come by. This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.Why this skulking psychopath is driven to making explicitly obscene phone calls in a variety of crazed voices to the girls before dispatching them remains a fairly foggy business. The slightly comic, alcoholic housemother, Marian Waldman, and Margot Kidder, who is also a drunk and as blatantly outspoken as the killer, and Andrea Martin and Lynne Griffin as the other victims, are obvious in perfunctory portrayals.Olivia Hussey, as the pregnant, sole survivor, is properly confused and terrified by the bloody events. But Keir Dullea, the neurotic music student-lover she rejects, does little but rant about the prospective child she doesn't want and smash his piano in a fit of rage.After several witless murders, John Saxon, the film's unflustered, if perplexed, detective, cynically asks a dumb cop, ""Don't you think we ought to look into it?""

It seeks neither to inform, nor reveal character nor expand the vocabulary of film. Its true purpose seems to be an exploration of the limits of revenue derivable from concert appearances.It is really, an illustrated recording that has tightly circumscribed its appeal to those who already know and 1ike the music of Yes.The movie, which runs about 75 minutes, is accompanied by a short called ""Death of a Red Planet.""

us,Pathos and Wit Light Up 'Hester St.',"There is nothing very original about ""Hester Street"" except its loveliness.Literally, it is a small movie about the struggles and transformations of the Jews who settled in the Lower East Side and tried to reconcile the ordered values they brought along with the unmarked opportunities they found.The immigrant theme, with its anecdotes, its incongruities, its mixture of comedy and pathos, has been played through any number of stories, novels, memoirs, films. How, then, can this film be so good?Partly, it is because movies are performances as well as creations. The effect of seeing ""Hester Street"" is that of seeing a familiar play""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" as done by Peter Brook or ""The Wild Duck"" as done by Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theaterlit up by an intent and flowering mind.Performance doesn't refer simply to the acting, though the cast of ""Hester Street,"" which opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater, is superlative, and Carol Kane in the starring role is extraordinary. It refers to the whole framing of the picture by Joan Micklin Silver, its author and director: the rhythms, the acute selection of incident and character.""Hester Street"" tells of the comic and painful Americanization of Jake and Gitl, an immigrant couple from Russia. In the opening scenes Jake, who has come over alone, is adapting whole-heartedly although with an aim that is slightly askew. Played with vigor and humor by Steven Keats, Jake has found himself a tailoring job, a whole bed for himselfactually, he confesses to a friend, it's a couch, but he's still ahead of others who have to double upand a girlfriend.But then Gitl arrives and brings with her not only hideous complications for Jake's love life, but also the dress, the bearing, the language and the customs of the Russian ghetto that Jake has so exuberantly put behind.They settle in: Jake, Gitl, their little boy, and a lodger. The lodger is a former rabbinical student named Bernstein who went into tailoring because he couldn't keep his mind off women, but nonetheless spends his evenings studying.It is a series of battles, Jake pushing his wife to give up her shawls, her hair-covering, her Yiddish; her making adjustments at her own pace, and far too slowly for him. The marriage founders; Jake gets a divorce, financed by his girlfriend, and marries her. And Gitl in a beautiful reversal that is neither sudden nor unprepared, but flows out of her own slowly blossoming strength, comes out ahead.The film is constructed on a series of sharp, brief incidents. There is Jake at Ellis Island meeting Gitl, who is arrayed  clothes, bundles, bagslike a whole history of the Diaspora. ""For what purpose are you bringing this woman in?"" an official asks Jake. ""For the purpose she's my wife,"" he answers in a near-howl.There is the owner of the tailor shop gloating at Bernstein's struggle with the unaccustomed manual work. ""The peddler becomes the boss and the Yeshiva student sits by the sewing machine,"" he chortles. ""Some country.""And in the lodgings, when Jake has stormed out in one of his rages, Bernstein and Gitl sit in mutual misery. ""When we come over here,"" he tells her, ""we say 'Goodbye, Lord, I'm going to America.'""The camerawork, in black and white, is deliberately restrained, but there is a moment of pure virtuosity. The scene is in the country, the camera points through leaves at the sun, a piano rag jangles on the soundtrack, and suddenly the whole comically tormented group bursts through the trees and the glare for a picnic.Some picnic. Jake determinedly plays American ball with his son; Gitl and Bernstein droop in Old Country poses against a tree. There is a pause in the athletics. ""Jake,"" she asksnever having been past Delancey Street""are there any gentiles in America?""Beyond all the details there is the magnificent performance of Carol Kane as Gitl. Big-eyed, scared and inaudible at first, a spark of allure pops out here, a spark of anger there, until by the end of the picture she is a triumphant bonfire. Miss Kane manages the high acting feat of seeming to change size physically, expanding and shrinking as she is happy or miserable.There is a defect in the picture, although it is not a major one. The street scenes are too fully packed with color: too many peddlers, too many mischievous children, too many barrows. It's like a stage set. Even the dresses hanging on racks seem instructed in their parts.But it is the only point at which Mrs. Silver's fine balance between realism and fable slips a bit into storyteller artifice. For the rest, ""Hester Street"" is an unconditionally happy achievement.",1975-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Egypt's 'Night of Counting Years',"""The Night of Counting the Years,"" which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater, is said by its distributors to be the first Egyptian movie to be shown in the United States. It has some beautifully composed shots of the desert and the Nile, and a few moments where the drama inhabits the actors instead of giving them orders from far away, but it isn't a success.It is set near the site of ancient Thebes, burial place of the Egyptian kings. A mountain clan, the Horrabat, has lived for generations by stripping artifacts and ornaments from a burial mound known only to itself, and selling them to dealers.The head of the clan dies; his two sons, learning for the first time of the trade off which they have lived, refuse to carry it on. One is murdered by their uncles; the younger one, Wanniss, hesitates but finally notifies the authorities. Soldiers remove the sarcophagi to Cairo, and the Horrabat's way of life is at an end.There are possibilities in the theme. It is a conflict between the down-to-earth traditions of the clan for whom the dead are their dead andin a true Nilotic cyclethe source of their life; and the larger, impersonal concern of Cairo with preserving history.Shadi Abdelsalam, the author and director, manages only once or twice to capture the proper human scale of the conflict. There is a scene where the graybeard uncles urge their followers to attack the procession of troops and bearers that is removing the sarcophagi. Nobody moves; the uncles start forward with their ancient rifles and then halt, aimlessly. A tiny, hopelessly bypassed community has just expired.Most of the movie, however, is done with stupefying grandiloquence. Wherever the camera touches, it sticks and won't let go. Landscape, brooding close-upsand how they all do broodinterminable patterns of black-robed figures against the white sand: Every shot lingers and lingers.The acting is heavy and hieratic, fogged with a pretentious mysticism. As Wanniss sulks about, trying to decide whether to serve the interests of his uncles or those of archeology, a mysterious stranger appears, hangs around for a while and vanishes; all to no apparent purpose.""Follow, observe but do not question,"" one of the uncles says early on, as he shows the brother the burial crypt.

us,Screen: 'Undercovers':Sellers Plays 6 Roles in Boultings Comedy,"The time is late spring, 1940. France is falling with a snicker. An aged marshal of the Army retreats from the front to his favorite Paris brothel, where he had left his corset when the blitzkreig began. The brothel is also the hideout for a dashing English twit, a Royal Air Force officer who uses the place as a base for underground operations. The brothel is visited by Hitler and later, when German officers keep disappearing from its bedrooms, the house is investigated by a pinchnosed Gestapo chief, a former income-tax examiner.The faces aren't familiar but the actor underneath all that plasticine is. It's none other than Peter Sellers in the Boulting brothers' new comedy, ""Undercovers Hero,"" which may possibly be the most awkward title of the week, next to ""The Night of Counting the Years,"" which has an excuse. It was translated from the Arabic.In ""Undercovers Hero,"" which opened yesterday at theaters around the city, Mr. Sellers also plays a Japanese prince and a president of France, a total of six roles, three more than he played in either ""The Mouse That Roared"" or ""Dr. Strange-love,"" and five more than he played in ""The Return of the Pink Panther.""The suspicion that he plays five more roles than are absolutely necessary in ""Undercovers Hero"" is both unfair and inaccurate. One could just as well argue that ""Jaws"" would be a more serious film without the shark. Multiple-role playing, so dear to the heart of revue comics (and Mr. Sellers is one of the best), is the entire point of this film, though whether by design or default. I can't tell.""Undercovers Hero"" is an almost creepily witless endeavor, and one that should make you appreciate the true lunacy of the Blake Edwards-Sellers collaboration on ""The Return of the Pink Panther."" Roy Boulting, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay of the new movie, and John Boulting, who produced it, have made a sketch film with very few jokes and of such incoherence that they have an actor feeding us a lot of dumb voice-over narration in the vocabulary and cadences of former President Nixon. What could they possibly have been thinking of?Two of the Sellers impersonations are amusingthe British officer who sounds like a frightfully grand idiot and the seedy Gestapo officer whose dark plans are forever being sabotaged by Curt Jergens, who plays a nice German officer. The other members of the cast include Lila Kedrova, as the brothel's cheery madame, and Beatrice Remand (of ""Claire's Knee"") as an innocent brothel slavey, a girl who dreams of one day of having her own career.They don't do very much, as if they feared that if they did, Mr. Sellers would take their roles for himself.

Though it's based on a novel that was actually written before the kidnapping, it seeks to exploit the real events in a manner that defames almost everyone, including the alleged kidnappers and their prey.It's about a pretty girl named Patty Prescott, whose father owns most of California, and her abduction by a small group of radicals who want Patty's father to blow up a high-income housing project that had originally been designed for poor people.Unless Patty's dad meets their demands, say the kidnappers, they will murder his daughter. In the meantime they seek to convert her to their play-school politics by sexual humiliation, first a rape by one of the men, then a seduction by one of the women, video tapes of which are sent off to dad to convince himof what I'm not sure. After a certain amount of rapping as well as raping, Patty has thrown in with her abductors and is really getting into group politics and sex.According to Variety, ""Abduction"" was originally planned as a soft-core porn film, but most of that footage has been left out. What remains is numb, cruel and mingy. The writing, directing and acting are so astonishingly below par that one wonders what Dorothy Malone and Leif Erickson, who play Patty's parents, are doing in the same cans of film with these other people.",1975-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,A talent that didn't unfold,"Alison Lurie's memoir raises questions about the importance of its heroine: Bunny Lang, a gifted eccentric who lived in Cambridge in the fifties and was one of the founders of the Poets' Theatre. The banality of her conversation as it is here recorded and the lists of her costumes do not convey the querulous warmth and astounding energy which made Bunny a queen to her circle of friends. Her peculiarities separate her; she is surrounded by a thorn hedge of privilege and arrogance which can only be pierced, in memory, by a few loyal friends. For who would have put up with her, as she is described in Alison Lurie's fascinating memoir, where resentment and affection are so thoroughly mixed? Bunny Lang's hostility was occasionally inspired: to revenge herself on a man she didn't like, she had thousands of pink labels printed, proclaiming My name is Parker and I am a pig, and pasted them up all over the wretched man's neighborhood. On a smaller scale, she wished her cat off on a devoted friend whose inability to say no reduced her life to a shambles dominated by guilt, rage, the cat and a litter of kittens. It sometimes seems that the vapidity of her friends' lives alone made Bunny's friendship worth the price she exacted; yet she was surrounded not by nonentities but by gifted writers such as Miss Lurie herself (author of The War Between the Tates), Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch and John Ashbery.

Despite his plea of nolo contendere to a felony count on income taxes and despite a voluminous document, prepared by the Justice Department, accusing him of bribery and extortion, Agnew steadfastly maintained that he was innocent of those charges. One day, he prophe sized, he would be vindicated. Stripped of his salary, barred from practicing law and beset with legal bills, Agnew made a quick financial recovery by becoming an instant, international business broker.

He coerced and cajoled the Israelis, but not to the point where their confidence in him was fatally undermined; he knew how far each side could ultimately go in meeting the demands of the other, and he was able to frame the terms of the negotiations accordingly. His exquisite sense of timing enabled him to come forward with his own final compromise formula at the precise moment when both sides were most inclined to accept it.

us,What's Doing in THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY,"OVERVIEWAlong the bottom of Texas, the Rio Grande pours sandcolored water into the Gulf of Mexico through a shallow valley, rich in alluvial soil that support a huge agricultural industry, chiefly citrus and cotton. The river sets the pace in this semitropical region. Life is lived more slowly. One seeks cool shade from the hot sun in the afternoon or welcomes fresh Gulf breeze that pushes the sticky humidity back a little; a tequila or rum drink is meant to be sipped slowly at sundown. However, there is an undercurrent of activity below the placid surface: a burgeoning tourism industry. For many years Texans have been going to the valley, as it is colloquially known, for deepsea fishing off the coast or whitewinged dove shooting in the cornfields and meadows of northern Mexico. In 1967, Hurricane Beulah leveled the area, blowing away most of the tacky old wooden fishing shacks and resorts. Faced with a clean slate, developers began thinking about upgrading tourist facilities, paticularly on Padre Island. They've taken their time about it, carefully building while maintaining much of the natural surroundings and promoting the area as a vacation and retirement center. It must be working, because more and more tourists are coming to the valley during the winter in cars bearing Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and other Midwestern license plates. Residents say the valley will boom like Florida, but I think the region is just inaccessible enough to keep from exploding in a wave of concrete highrises and trailer parks that would push prices out of the reach of the middle class. It is unlikely to get to the stage where one can't pack up the family and spend two weeks in a tent on the beach.",1975-10-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'The Devil Is a Woman,' Import With Glenda Jackson","You might imagine that anyone would have to be kidding to call a movie ""The Devil Is a Woman"" in this day and age. Not at all. ""The Devil Is a Woman,"" the British-Italian co-production that opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, means to be quite serious.It has nothing to do with the 1935 film of the same title  the great Josef Von Sternberg-Marlene Dietrich collaborationnor is it about diabolism. That is, it's not about diabolism as movie buffs in the last half of this century have come to recognize the symptoms: rocking beds, vomit, levitating children and the voice of Mercedes McCambridge running off at someone else's mouth.This ""Devil Is a Woman"" was directed by Damiano Damiani, an Italian director whose earlier credits are none too promising (""Arturo's Island,"" ""The Empty Canvas""), but originally it may not have been quite so foolish as it now is. The film seems to have been so badly edited for its American release that it contradicts its own plot at key places. Also, some of the post-sychronized English dialogue is impossible to understand.Behind this cracked facade one occasionally glimpses the traces of an interesting if overwrought intellectual drama of the kind that Europeans take more seriously than we do. The setting ia a religious hostel-convent in Rome, a place that doesn't look much different from thousands of other Roman buildings on the outside but that on the inside suggests a series of sets that haven't yet been fully dressed for a Ken Russell movie.Running the establishment is Glenda Jackson, playing a character named Sister Geraldine, a handsome, frosty-mannered nun who enunciates so perfectly she always sounds as if she were in a speech competition. Sister Geraldine is big on the possibilities of redemption through prayer, group therapy (called ""community meetings""), chastity and various other forms of self-denial.Because of this she neglects her duties at the convent to devote herself to the saving of a motley group of souls who have sought voluntary refuge in her art-deco hostel. Among them are a beautiful young Latin American woman who fingered her right-wing husband for assassination by associates of her left-wing lover; a young Roman prince whose family won't allow him to marry the girl he loves (his sister); a Cuban bishop who sided with Fidel Castro in the revolution, and a Polish monsignor accused of working with the Nazis against the Russians.Into this atmosphere, which is never as charged as it's supposed to be, comes a youngish Italian journalist who has been commissioned by the Polish monsignor to write the monsignor's defense. The journalist, who goes around preaching reason and the therapeutic value of not brooding too much, nearly wrecks Sister Geraldine's world, but he's a lazy fox in the hen house. How Sister Geraldine triumphs is the foggy point of the film.Neither Miss Jackson nor the other performers is especially convincing meeting the film's sometimes operatic requirements, including suicide, self-abuse (a priest's discreet term), fetishism and the like. Moral dilemmas are introduced, labelled and then passed over, like the fancy decor seen by the camera. Nothing is explored in depth. ""The Devil Is a Woman"" sort of scratches ideas as if they were minor itches.",1975-10-27T05:00:00+0000

It goes on and onit lurches, really  in little fits and starts of inspiration from dimly remembered earlier movies.It's about an honest cowboy (Jim Brown), a cheerfully dishonest gambler (Fred Williamson) and a mute Indian scout (Jim Kelly) and their efforts to transport $86,000 across hundreds of miles of Western wilderness to the families to whom it belongs in Mexico. The trail is fraught with dangers, and busier than Eighth Avenue on a Saturday night. There's a gun waiting behind every bush and lots of incredibly good marksmanship by the stars, and incredibly bad marksmanship by the villains, which is the only way a movie like this keeps going.The villains include Lee Van Cleef and Barry Sullivan and are mostly white. The film was shot in the Canary Islands by an Italian director who calls himself Anthony M. Dawson, though his name is actually Antonio Margheriti.Mr. Williamson works hard to achieve a light touch but all his efforts are immediately absorbed by Mr. Brown, whose impassive performance acts as a kind of blotter.
