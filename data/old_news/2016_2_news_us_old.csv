In post-9/11 America, questions like these shape our national discourse on terrorism, law enforcement and public safety. Peter Bergen, CNNs national security analyst and the author of four other books on terrorism, addresses these and other salient questions in his excellent new United States of Jihad: Investigating Americas Homegrown Terrorists. Bergen seeks to understand why some Americans choose to become jihadists, how our institutions have responded to terrorism and how American society has been changed by terrorist threats. Terrorism has long existed in this country  Bergen describes the 1970s as the golden age of terrorism in the United States  but the horrific attacks of Sept. 11 and the loss of nearly 3,000 lives on American soil were to earlier terrorist attacks as a tsunami is to a high tide. Just as a tsunami leaves a landscape forever altered once it retreats, so too has Sept. 11 fundamentally changed America. The difficulty Bergen faces in mapping and analyzing post-9/11 homegrown terrorism is the ever shifting, contemporaneous terrain of his subject  its a bit like writing a history of the 1960s while the Beatles are still singing. Nonetheless, Bergens book is the best one-volume treatment available on the current state of jihad in America.",2016-02-01T10:30:03+0000

As the inaugural exhibition for Paces newly minted Art+Technology program, housed in the gallerys Menlo Park space, it places tech-based art directly in the heart of Silicon Valley  to completely surprising effect. We respect Silicon Valley exceedingly, but, as things are happening all the time, we arent paying it a lot of attention, says Toshiyuki Inoko, the collectives founder. TeamLab wants to contribute to mankind through a different role than Silicon Valley. The exhibition, titled Living Digital Space and Future Parks, aims to be a disruptor  and not in the tech-jargon sense, but rather more literally. We want to think about a new way for art to be, Inoko says. Not just works of art, but including everything: space, viewers, even the market.",2016-02-04T22:14:50+0000

But the Target Margin Theater, known for radically reinventing classic behemoths, is not about to be daunted by a little excess weight. (Last year, it hoisted the dense literary conundrums of Gertrude Stein.) The company begins a two-season project devoted to ONeill with a series of works that excavate and abstract the unwieldy Electra under the title Drunken With What at the Abrons Arts Center. As the name suggests, the lines between the muse and the bottle in ONeills work will be considered, though in separate, cocktail-size gulps instead of a marathon binge. David Herskovits, Target Margins founder and artistic director, presides as spiritual bartender and mixologist.

(No.4 after 91 weeks). Chasts memoir was chosen as one of the Book Reviews 10 Best Books in 2014, when we wrote that cartoons, it turns out, are tailor-made for the absurdities of old age, illness and dementia. But the book is equally moving as an account of Chasts relationship with her parents  in particular her difficult, complicated mother. Ive been aware of issues with my mother since I was a little kid, Chast told me recently via email. The book didnt really help me come to terms with them. There are certain things that dont work out in life, and writing a book is an interesting way to look at those things and think about them. And Im aware it could have been much, much worse. She had a lot of wonderful qualities: She was strong-willed and very smart. Ive been told by her former students that she was the best teacher they ever had.

It showed a crowd of Chinese watching while one of their compatriots was beheaded by the Japanese, accused of being a Russian spy. They were all strong fellows but appeared completely apathetic, Zhou recalled. After this film I felt that medical science was not so important after all. The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they may be, can only serve to be made examples of, or to witness such futile spectacles. ... The most important thing, therefore, was to change their spirit, and since at that time I felt that literature was the best means to this end, I determined to promote a literary movement.",2016-02-05T16:07:20+0000

us,Laura Secors Children of Paradise: The Struggle for the Soul of Iran,"In the mid-1980s, a few years after Iran became the worlds first modern revolutionary theocracy, two charismatic intellectuals and their followers conducted a long-running feud over metaphysics in the countrys newspapers and lecture halls. One of the intellectuals, Laura Secor writes in Children of Paradise, an engrossing but narrowly focused history of the Iranian reform movement, was Abdolkarim Soroush, a champion of the Austrian-British philosopher of science and open-society advocate Karl Popper. Farsi translations of Poppers works were flying off the shelves. But they were being savaged in the press by devotees of Soroushs rival, Ahmad Fardid, who espoused the views of Martin Heidegger. Many hard-liners in the Islamic Republic were attracted to Heidegger, the midcentury German thinker tainted by his ties to Nazism, as a counter to Western scientific rationalisms claims to universalism. Because both philosophers were associated with the ruling regime, their debates were fully aired before the public, Secor says. Iranian intellectuals, perhaps thrilling to the aura of purpose, often describe the battle as a war by proxy between Heidegger and Popper.",2016-02-05T16:11:59+0000

us,Inside the List,"Prophets of Doom: Some authors so thoroughly dominate their genre that rivals may want to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Act. Malcolm Gladwell, for instance, is the king of pithily titled, sociologically inflected narrative nonfiction with a vaguely entrepreneurial self-help feel; his Outliers has spent 208 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list and is currently No.7 on the monthly business list. So it seems almost cheeky that the Wharton School professor Adam Grant has settled, for his latest addition to the field, on the pithy title Originals. Grants book, which debuts at No.2 on the hardcover nonfiction list  and comes with a front-cover endorsement from Gladwell  overlaps with Outliers in substance as well as style: Both propose to explain why some people rise above their peers to change the world. (Gladwell emphasizes practice; Grant, passion and nonconformity.) Readers of the Book Review may be particularly interested in one study Grant cites, in which a psychologist gave subjects an actual New York Times book review, modified to make it either extremely positive or extremely negative, then asked them to rate the critics intelligence. Which version makes the reviewer sound smarter? Grant asks. People rated the critical reviewer as 14 percent more intelligent, and having 16 percent greater literary expertise, than the complimentary reviewer. People think an amateur can appreciate art, but it takes a professional to critique it. Or, as the original researcher put it, Prophets of doom and gloom appear wise and insightful, while positive statements are seen as having a nave Pollyanna quality.",2016-02-12T17:39:23+0000

us,"Salt to the Sea, by Ruta Sepetys","A group of teenage refugees meet on the road in the chaotic countryside of East Prussia in winter 1945. The Nazi Reich is collapsing all around them, and they, like hundreds of thousands, are fleeing the wrathful Soviet advance. They are trapped between their German conquerors and their terrifying Russian liberators. Their story is told through the voices of Joana, a pretty Lithuanian nurse; Florian, a Prussian with a mysterious letter of passage from a high-ranking Nazi officer; and Emilia, an idealistic but damaged Polish girl in a pink knit cap. Thrown together, struggling to survive, they at first hardly trust one another enough even to exchange names, and so they often just use epithets: the knight, the nurse, the Polish girl, the wandering boy, the shoe poet. (The last, an old cobbler, gets his name from his philosophy: The shoes always tell the story.) Each has secrets  the galling histories that haunt anyone who has lived through war, flight and deprivation.",2016-02-12T17:43:49+0000

In fact, the murder of up to half a million Roma in camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka is comparable to the Shoah on every level except that of scale.

Forget the explicit reference to terror; a clammier sort of eeriness settles on the reader who pauses to research the identity of the epigraphs supposed source, Elihu Hoopes, who turns out to be the man without a shadow of the title.

Readers of Faulkss fiction, most notably of the loose trilogy formed by Birdsong, The Girl at the Lion dOr and Charlotte Gray, know that his wartime plots tend to involve men and women finding and losing each other.

Somewhere was presumably a last glance backward at her romances with married men in her frequent role as the Other Woman, coupled with observations about caretaking her mother in her final days and insights on a variety of topics, from faith to fashion, from the perspective of advanced old age.

There are the foxes in Machiavellis The Prince (One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps. ...) and Jean de La Fontaines verses, and theres Disneys Robin Hood, matinee idol that he was. For me the most memorable literary fox until now has been the baby fox in Ted Hughess poem Epiphany  a distilled ball of mannerless energy and old smell, and a test of the poets ability to bend his life and marriage to fit the presence of something so wild and destructive, and so beautiful. Pax, the eponymous fox of Sara Pennypackers new novel, is built on the model of Hughess cub, half wild and half domesticated, a galvanic presence fit to join the ranks of fictions great foxes.",2016-02-12T18:09:09+0000

But still: damp shoes, damp clothes, the dank smell of river. The leak in the hall splitting the ceiling like the crust of a loaf. The snowed-in feeling of Lucy Woods captivating debut novel, Weathering, comes from such descriptions of the house Ada has inherited upon her mothers death, to which she has brought her young daughter, Pepper. This dampness so pervades the book that it almost swells the pages, and the imagery typifies Woods wonderful and energetic style, all the way down to the smallest detail: She found a silty smudge, like a handprint, on the outside of the kitchen window and a small pile of stones on the front steps. Lest you settle down too comfortably in this winter cabin of a novel: The handprint is that of her dead mother, Pearl.",2016-02-12T18:10:30+0000

us,"West of Eden, by Jean Stein","Oral history looks all too easy. When the Belarussian writer Svetlana Alexievich won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature for her oral histories of humanitarian crises, it seemed an overdue confirmation of the genres literary nature  not just its capacity to tell sweeping, timeless human stories, but also the craft and cunning involved in its artful assemblage of specific, individual voices. In this country the form has proved to be both a serious vehicle for popular history and a reliable producer of best sellers, beginning with Studs Terkels Working in 1974. But it was Jean Steins 1982 book Edie: American Girl, edited with George Plimpton, that gave oral history the particular shimmer that comes when lofty literary aims happen to coincide with sheer entertainment value. Edie conjured the tragic life of Edith Sedgwick, who was born into a patrician New England family, grew up with seven siblings on isolated ranches near Santa Barbara under the yoke of a semi-deranged father, came east and after a stint in a mental hospital became Andy Warhols arm candy and a figure in New York counterculture, before being cast out by him and dying at 28 of an overdose. In many ways Steins new book, West of Eden, continues the larger project she began in Edie: chronicling a trickster promise embedded in our national consciousness  something shining and elusive and at its center not just ugly but quite often deadly.",2016-02-16T20:26:41+0000

Bergman, working for a nonprofit research organization called SkyTruth, had mastered the use of satellite data to chart a ships most likely course.

I have one client whom I like very much and who has requested my services a number of times, but whenever I leave that clients house, I find myself troubled. This family has a teacup pig, which lives with them in a medium-size apartment. I consider myself an animal lover, and it so happens that I have looked into the fad of teacup pigs. I know that they are really piglets of a larger variety, the potbellied pig, which are unintentionally underfed by owners who have been led by dishonest sellers to believe that the pigs need to eat less than they really do. Right now the pig is small, perhaps 10 to 15 pounds, but I know it will keep growing and that the lowest healthy weight for a full-grown teacup pig is about 60 pounds; a potbellied pig can easily grow to more than 100 pounds. I asked the family how big the pig would get, thinking perhaps they knew the facts and had some plan. They told me that they expect it to remain the size it is now. The worst part? They often remark that the pig is acting hungry; I imagine they feed him the too-small amount they were directed to by the seller. I believe that this family loves their pig very much and that I am witnessing an unintentional act of animal cruelty, but I am in a quandary: Should I tell them that they are unwittingly mistreating their beloved pet? I worry that I would be overstepping my professional bounds.

This book represents the backlash against the frantic pursuit of whats often known as enrichment, a term that can seem most apropos for the wallets of the adults who teach and coach all these after-school classes, teams and activities. Spiress message is not subtle: She writes as an unapologetic champion of the idea that, rather than pushing elementary-schoolers into organized, goal-oriented pursuits, we would enrich their lives more by offering them, say, a couple of unstructured hours with a giant cardboard box, some scissors, packing tape and markers, and no grown-ups chirping directions at them.",2016-02-17T16:31:11+0000

Then, he went to Seattle, to become the artistic director of Pacific Northwest Ballet. But Mr. Boal cant seem to stay away for long. The company returns to City Center with a pair of repertory programs and live music. In Contemporary Innovators, Mr. Boal pays homage to William Forsythe, whose The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude (1996), a ballet set to Schubert, will be performed alongside works by two of Mr. Forsythes former dancers: David Dawson (A Million Kisses to My Skin) and Crystal Pite (Emergence). The other program, dedicated to George Balanchine, shows Mr. Boals City Ballet roots with Square Dance, Prodigal Son and Stravinsky Violin Concerto. That one is a slam dunk.

Hardly anyone is held accountable for the thousands of seafarers, fishermen and migrants who die every year because of unsafe vessels, territorial disputes and violence aboard ships. Murder is committed on camera, witnesses pose for selfies, footage is posted online, but no one investigates.

Her deposition will continue March 14, Mr. Cammarata said. Mr. Cosbys lawyers had sought to prevent Mrs. Cosby, 71, who was the entertainers business manager, from sitting for the deposition on a variety of grounds, and filed an emergency motion Saturday to delay it. But Judge Mark G. Mastroianni of United States District Court ruled Sunday that the deposition should go ahead, although Mrs. Cosby was not compelled to answer questions about her private conversations with her husband. Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby, declined to comment. The civil case is separate from the criminal charges that Mr. Cosby, 78, faces in Pennsylvania, where a woman has accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2004. ",2016-02-23T03:36:15+0000

The program he presents for his solo recital at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, March 3, is a riddle of sorts, too, a musical palindrome. After opening with one Bach Partita (No. 6), it moves on to early Schumann, pauses on the Impressionist-Symbolist reverie of Szymanowskis Metopes, then reverses its steps through late Schumann and back to Bach (Partita No. 1). Metopes, based on three Classical friezes depicting stages of Homers The Odyssey, are lovely works that are too rarely played and that seem to look both forward and backward. The first is inspired by Odysseuss encounter with the Sirens. It will be haunting to hear it followed by Schumanns Ghost Variations, the last work he wrote before being confined to a mental institution; according to experts, Schumann tried to drown himself in the Rhine between the composition of the fourth and fifth variations.

us,Florida: Bill to Regulate Fracking Fails to Advance,"A bill to regulate fracking, an oil and gas extraction technique that is relatively new to Florida and vigorously opposed across the state, was voted down on Thursday by a pivotal State Senate committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the measure in a 10-to-9 bipartisan vote. Floridas extremely porous geology raised fears among environmentalists and Florida residents that well stimulation could more easily lead to contamination of underground aquifers, the source of drinking water for almost all Floridians. The bill, which had passed the House, proposed regulating only two forms of well stimulation in the state but left out a third method, matrix acidizing, that is conducted with low pressure. It also would not require oil and gas companies to reveal all of the chemicals they would put into the ground because some are protected by federal law. The legislation called for a study on the potential effect of well stimulation, but matrix acidizing would not be part of the study. Local governments objected to the legislation because it would prohibit them from banning well stimulation. Nearly 80 counties and cities have passed resolutions or ordinances that banned or opposed fracking. The bill can be called up again in the Senate committee. Well stimulation is not regulated in Florida and does not require a separate permit. ",2016-02-26T01:03:45+0000

So it was with some trepidation that I picked up Ways to Disappear, the first novel by the poet and translator Idra Novey. The protagonist, Emma Neufeld, is a Portuguese-to-English translator devoted to the work of a cult-classic Brazilian writer.

Readers looking for gossip about Kirk and Spock wont be disappointed  theres plenty here about contract disputes, on-set rivalries and substance abuse, along with the revelation that Nimoy, who died in 2015 at the age of 83, essentially stopped speaking to Shatner for the last several years of his life because Shatner had filmed him without permission for a documentary about the Starship Enterprise. But Shatner also devotes generous space to his friends sensitive artistic side, taking note of Nimoys photographic pursuits and seven volumes of poetry  including, in 1973, the surprisingly successful debut You & I, which went through five print runs in hardcover and had an initial paperback printing of 250,000 copies. What helped sell the book, of course, was the fact that Leonard was willing to promote it by doing bookstore signings, Shatner writes. It may have been Leonards poetry  but fans were getting Spocks autograph. What did Shatner think of the work? Trying to understand poets through their poetry requires higher degrees than I have, he writes, but it is obvious reading his work that from the beginning to the end Leonard was intent on emotionally defining grand themes like love, compassion, loss and the endless search for roots. For the man who became famous playing the ultimate dispassionate character, his poems successfully bring out the range of important emotions.",2016-02-26T17:40:37+0000

Sometimes she writes as if it is a personal insult to her for people to have any religion. She resents the fact that a nun of the Dominican order, singing a tribute to the orders founder, St. Dominic, did so with a mind-numbing refrain that still pounds in my cortex as Dominiqua-niqua-niqua.
