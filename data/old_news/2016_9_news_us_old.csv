Unpredictability is the key element of tickling, which is why you cannot tickle yourself. Brains are prediction machines; if your own hand reaches in for a tickle, your brain will foresee and cancel out the results. (Research shows that some schizophrenics are able to tickle themselves because they dont make the same distinctions between self and other.) Davila-Ross has tickled humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans and gorillas, and she says sometimes just the pretouch anticipation evokes laughter. Only the great apes regularly tickle one another, although many animals, including rats, cats and dogs, enjoy it. (In one study, rats kept in social isolation and exposed to regular electrical shocks exhibited less fear and lower catecholamine stress hormones when tickled daily by a researcher.)",2016-09-01T09:00:06+0000

On Monday the amount alleged to have been stolen was currently given as 250,000, and since then the sum has advanced by leaps and bounds, until today it was confidently asserted in the City that it amounted to half a million. These rumors have obtained a degree of credence in banking circles which calls for authoritative treatment. There is no truth whatever in the report, which, if well founded, would have startled the commercial world, and must have produced results disastrous to the largest interests. The Governor of the Bank of England states that there is absolutely no foundation for the rumors. The story, it appears, arose as follows: It will be remembered that in February last a counter robbery was effected at the Bank of Scotland. Certain of the securities then stolen have been within the last few days presented for payment in Paris, and in one of the Paris papers an announcement appeared confusing the Bank of Scotland with the Bank of England, and stating the amount of the frauds to have been 250,000.

Edsel (and his co-writer, Bret Witter) spent 21 weeks on the paperback nonfiction list with The Monuments Men, about Allied efforts to retrieve looted art from the Germans; now Elizabeth Lettss The Perfect Horse  No.17 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list  tells a similar story about the mission to save a breed of horses, the noble Lipizzaner stallions, that the Nazis abducted to create a master race of war animals. General Patton himself approved the rescue: Get them. Make it fast, the book quotes him saying. But why divert military resources to protect horses, however mighty? According to an essay Letts wrote for the Amazon blog Omnivoracious, the answer lies with the Armys legacy of training cavalry officers. Turns out, the interwar years are called the cavalrys golden age, she says. Army-bred horses won Olympic medals and Army-trained riders shone in international competitions. To belong to the U.S. Cavalry was to be a skilled rider. It was also to be trained in a code of honor known to cavalries around the world: Always take care of your horse first. In the last days of World War II, the worlds most priceless purebreds were in danger of being slaughtered for food. Their only hope was a group of American soldiers who by chance were camped out nearby. As it happened, these were the soldiers of the Second Cavalry  one of Americas most storied mounted units, and one of the last to be mechanized. ... As Patton liked to remind people, many of the most celebrated leaders in World War II got their start as cavalry officers, and in the last days of the war, when the priceless purebreds were in danger, these men remembered the lesson to put the horses first. Letts is, no surprise, a horse lover herself: Her previous best seller, The Eighty-Dollar Champion, was about the show jumper Snowman, and in her Twitter biography she admits she never got over Black Beauty.",2016-09-02T15:20:27+0000

They are the inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha, and it is so far off the beaten track that they have not heard officially from the Motherland for ten years, but now a ship has been chartered to visit the island and take mails. The Colonial Office and other friends of the islanders are sending them comforts and stores, and at the offices of the Crown Agents for the Colonies (who are packing and dispatching the goods free) there have been busy scenes the past few days. The gifts are chiefly of a practical value, and include soap, which is greatly in demand in Tristan da Cunha, rope, dungaree for making clothes, boots, rice, oars, medical supplies and sails.The women exiles are not forgotten, and a good supply of hairpins and other necessities will bring joy to the belles of Tristan. The only flag the islanders are said to have to prove their allegiance to the Empire is a red ensign, and the Colonial Office is sending out a brand new Union Jack. There are sure to be hearty cheers in the lonely settlement when the new flag arrives and is unfurled.  The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 1, 1916",2016-09-04T16:55:13+0000

Emerson was an unmethodical writer with low, puffy sideburns who liked to work himself up into paragraphs of rapture. When it came time for him to write an essay or give an oration  about nature, say, or self-reliance  he combed through his voluminous journals and pulled out choice bits that were more or less on topic, and he glued them together with some connective prose. For instance, in Nature, Emerson writes: Standing on the bare ground,  my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,  all mean egotism vanishes.

Sandy or muddy substrates like riverbanks hold prints, too, but dont bother with forest floors blanketed in leaves or pine needles. If you have a nice fresh snow, you can track an animal all day, come back the next day and pick up where you left off, Rezendes says. Snow can help prevent your getting lost too, by allowing you to trace your own imprints back to your starting point.",2016-09-09T09:00:04+0000

As a founder of New Journalism in the 1960s and the author of sprawling social novels beginning with The Bonfire of the Vanities, in 1987, Wolfe has cast a big shadow on generations of American writers. But it turns out mere influence isnt what he has in mind with The Kingdom of Speech, new on the hardcover nonfiction list at No.14. Instead, Wolfe trains his sights on biological evolution  specifically, Darwins theory of natural selection  and what he sees as its inadequacy to account for the existence of human language. Along the way, he also attacks the neo-Darwinian linguist Noam Chomsky, who has advanced the idea of language as an innate evolutionary trait.",2016-09-09T15:13:55+0000

Les Moulins de Mahjoub, an organic extra-virgin oil, is deeper in color, more viscous and herbal, with a nice green olive bite.

Daly simply outlined the eyes, saturating the upper and lower lash lines in Nars Eyeliner Stylo in Carpates, then traced Nars Kohliner Minorque along the inner waterline.

Maybe its a little smaller at the bottom, maybe its a little bigger on top, just to make sure you dont overpower the eye, or look like a raccoon, she noted. Daly also recommends stepping back and looking in the mirror to ensure your liner is somewhat symmetrical on both eyes. But dont agonize over it: Its all about what works best for you when doing your makeup, and being your own artist.",2016-09-12T21:38:01+0000

After allowing the hair to set, he carefully twisted and twirled small sections around a curling iron with the dimensions of a chopstick. The real power move was to stop short of what Duffy termed instant noodle hair, by literally clapping the curls between the palms of the hands to break them up, for a more modern, lived-in look. Once complete, the elastic was snipped out and the hair swept over either to the left or the right of models heads, in what amounted to a hair homage to a young Cindy Crawford.",2016-09-18T15:45:39+0000

The chicken soup in The Gefilte Manifesto uses chicken parts that you brown before making the soup, something I have never done. But it works, enhancing depth and color in the broth. The whole point of the book, by the founders of the Gefilteria, the inventive online Jewish food company and caterer, is reworking traditional kosher Ashkenazi cooking and preparing dishes from scratch, with recipes like an inspired kimchi-stuffed cabbage. Theres even a recipe for kosher kimchi. But the so-called apple strudel, while easy and tasty, is a deep-dish pie, not a strudel at all. Another new approach to your Rosh Hashana dinner (the observance starts the evening of Oct. 2) may come from the kosher New York steakhouse Le Marais. Consider recipes for duck cassoulet, coq au vin, slow-roasted lamb shoulder or veal braciole from this new book instead of the usual brisket or roast chicken. The chef, Mark Hennessey, explains various steak cuts and how he adapts French recipes so they conform to the kashrut: The Gefilte Manifesto: New Recipes for Old World Jewish Foods, by Jeffrey Yoskowitz and Liz Alpern (Flatiron Books, $35), and Le Marais: A Rare Steakhouse  Well Done, by Mark Hennessey and Jose Meirelles (Gefen Publishing, $29.95).",2016-09-19T15:37:23+0000

Last Thursday afternoon, Jacobs unveiled his spring/summer 2017 show, to generally positive critical reviews  and a social media brouhaha. The focus was the models hair, braided into multicolored dreadlocks inspired by the transgender filmmaker Lana Wachowski and sourced online. The designer was subsequently accused of cultural appropriation, of lifting influences from black culture and showing them on a cast of predominantly white models. Jacobs was rapidly tried and sentenced by a public jury; a fusillade of comments rained down on Instagram and Twitter. Jacobs responded, first by justifying his actions and then, after that engendered further criticism, apologizing for the justification, and for any offense caused. The story had already leapt from the fashion pages: Time ran a piece, as did many other general-interest publications.",2016-09-21T19:11:07+0000

Marshal Henri Ptain is back in the provisional capital after a visit to the Alpine province of Savoy, and Jacques Benoist-Mechin, Under Secretary of State, is on his way here from Paris. Benoist-Mechin, one of the most ardent collaborationists, has his office in Paris, where he is in fact, if not titularly, the most important representative of the Ptain government. His return to Vichy follows discussions with Otto Abetz, the German Ambassador at Paris. Informed quarters here say they expect no important developments in Franco-German relations soon, but it is cautiously admitted that Benoist-Mechins visit here signifies a resumption of contacts with the Nazis.

us,The Story Behind This Weeks Best Sellers,"Timber: I speak for the trees, the Lorax proclaimed. But maybe trees can speak for themselves, if wed just shut up and listen. Thats the premise of a book by the German forest ranger Peter Wohlleben, The Hidden Life of Trees, that debuts at No. 5 on the hardcover nonfiction list and explains  in strikingly anthropomorphic terms  how trees protect their young, communicate through underground networks and develop sophisticated social communities, among other things. When trees are really thirsty, they begin to scream, Wohlleben writes. If youre out in the forest, you wont be able to hear them, because this all takes place at ultrasonic levels. Published last year in Germany, the book has already been a big best seller there, prompting a New York Times profile of the author last winter. (My favorite quote came not from Wohlleben  who once clarified to a German newspaper that I dont hug trees and I dont talk to them  but from a German literary critic eager to dismiss the idea that forestry was a particularly German obsession: Yes, theres Hansel and Gretel, and, sure, if your marriage fails, you go for a long hike in the woods. But I dont think Germans love their forest more than Swedes or Norwegians or Finns.) Now that Wohllebens book has been translated into English, by Jane Billinghurst, other media outlets are also taking notice. The thing that surprised me most is how social trees are, Wohlleben told The Guardian recently. I stumbled over an old stump one day and saw that it was still living although it was 400 or 500 years old, without any green leaf. Every living being needs nutrition. The only explanation was that it was supported by the neighbor trees via the roots with a sugar solution. ... Trees are very interested in keeping every member of this community alive.",2016-09-23T14:39:38+0000

us,Ts New Design & Luxury Issue: Editors Letter,"Design is so pervasive, argues Michael Rock in his Sign of the Times essay, that it often appears as fact rather than the result of subjective decision-making. After a period of time, an idea that originally evolved from mores, habits or customs becomes so codified and ingrained that it takes on the air of inevitability. For this issue, we decided to take a closer look at the meaning of design and why we make certain choices, from the wild natural beauty of Isabel and Julian Bannermans garden to the fine attention to detail in the rising designer Billy Cottons interiors. We considered the psychological effects of design, from the standpoint of a mad collector, the young fashion designer Jonathan Anderson, to what happens when it all goes terribly wrong. Of course, we also celebrate the vast range of the designed world: teapots, interesting hairdos, clever companies, artists communities, fabric, paint and rugs, jewels, clothing, even plumbing. Added up, these stories are a call to see design more clearly, to appreciate what is all around us, but also to realize the delicacy of ingenuity  that none of it had to be quite this way, and yet it is. And, to recognize that if something isnt working, we can try to design its change.",2016-09-23T16:01:43+0000

To add to the high stakes, Mr. Khan decided to commission a score rather than use the ballets traditional music by Adolphe Adam, then parted ways with his composer, Ben Frost, a month before the premiere, replacing him with Vincenzo Lamagna.",2016-09-29T00:40:37+0000

Chicken tetrazzini was spaghetti, heavy cream, chicken, mushrooms and Parmesan, served with two classic French sauces, chicken velout and hollandaise, on top. This was fancy food, if hardly Italian, and within just a few years you could find tetrazzini in the dining rooms of the nations swankier hotels. In the 1930s, the actor Vincent Price used to eat it at Sardis in Manhattan, where he was a thrice-weekly regular during a run of Victoria Regina at the Broadhurst Theater across the street.

Then, at the Muse des Arts Dcoratifs, she was arrested after crashing an exhibition devoted to Barbie, appearing in a plastic costume that reimagined the classic doll as a symbol of 21st-century feminism, with articulated nipples, pubic hair, a nose ring and Go-Pro camera strapped to her head. While some dismiss these unsanctioned appearances as shameless provocations, the Luxembourg-born Ms. De Robertis, 32, sees her work in the tradition of guerrilla performance artists like Valie Export and Andrea Fraser.
