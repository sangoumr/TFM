Most of the time, however, it proffers fantasies to match the hallucinatory music. Made in 1974, it's already an artifact of a time when the hangover of the late 1960's met the disillusioned 1970's; black power and free jazz collided with the fashion sense of Superfly.

The team was also cited for failing to notify the league of the allegations. The league's inquiry was prompted by reports that Bruce Firestone, former chairman and co-owner of the Senators, had offered inducements to players to lose their final game against the Boston Bruins so Ottawa would be assured the first pick in last June's entry draft. Although there was some dispute as to what exactly was said, Firestone acknowledged that certain intemperate and inappropriate comments were made regarding the club's performance last season, the league said. But Commissioner Gary Bettman said, ""There was no basis in fact to those comments."" (AP) COLLEGE FOOTBALL Two Winning Debuts It was a winning start for two coaches in new assignments last night.

The question sounds naive today, yet the authors of the eight essays in ROME REBORN: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture (Library of Congress/Yale University, $55) argue persuasively that the Vatican Library restored the splendor of Rome. The collection was the torch by which the Renaissance papacy guided itself, and its culture, out of the Dark Ages. The library allowed popes to ""place knowledge systematically at the service of governance."" The essayists in ""Rome Reborn"" present the vast range of the library's holdings -- from astronomy and philosophy to medicine and cartography -- and describe how the collection expanded. Particularly engaging are an essay on music and the papal choir by Richard Sherr, who teaches music at Smith College, and an essay on the Vatican's Oriental collection by Howard L. Goodman, who teaches East Asian studies at Harvard. Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton who edited ""Rome Reborn,"" contributes a fascinating study, ""The Ancient City Restored: Archeology, Ecclesiastical History and Egyptology,"" detailing how the library influenced the physical transformation of the city. The volume includes more than 200 color illustrations, including beautiful reproductions from editions of Virgil, Euclid and Aristotle.

The aprons, with their dangling yards of stringlike ties, are baffling to many when seen on a store hanger. But some women were not put off. Among the designers who put the apron back in style are Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, both from Belgium. The strings create a high or low waist and often crisscross in back over T-shirts, tailored blouses, turtleneck sweaters or leotards. Polly Mellen, center, the creative director of Allure magazine, wore her checked apron as a midcalf wraparound dress teamed with a white T-shirt. Other women topped slim, ankle-length skirts with different lengths of wraparound aprons. One of the most popular was a black apron that young women wore in the evening.

Of course, eight of the victories are from last season. . . . NEIL SMITH, the Chiefs' designated franchise player and their most valuable player in 1992, ended his contract holdout on Saturday and played yesterday against the Buccaneers. The defensive end had one tackle and one sack, but the latter was nullified by a penalty for having too many men on the field. . . . Speaking of defensive lineman, you may be wondering how Green Bay's REGGIE WHITE did yesterday. Well, the $17 million former Philadephia Eagle spent the afternoon lining up all over the defensive front. He had two tackles and no sacks. For what it's worth, he also had a sackless preseason. . . . JOE MONTANA is 37 years old and STEVE DeBERG, the league's oldest player, is 39. Yesterday, they squared off against each other in Tampa, Fla. The last time two quarterbacks the age of 37 or older started in the same game was Oct. 26, 1978. In that game, 39-year-old FRAN TARKENTON led the Minnesota Vikings to a 21-10 victory over 37-year-old ROGER STAUBACH and the Dallas Cowboys. . . . Los Angeles Rams quarterback JIM EVERETT completed just 17 of 41 for 175 yards as his team took a shellacking from Green Bay. Still, the yardage was enough to push him ahead of ROMAN GABRIEL and make him the career passing yardage leader for the Rams. . . .",1993-09-06T05:00:00+0000

People took to the streets of Bogota and other cities, dancing, honking car horns and waving flags. Besides the host, the United States, and defending champion Germany, Colombia joined Mexico, Russia and Greece for next summer's championship. Before 60,000 fans at River Plate Stadium, the Colombians were so overwhelming even the hometown crowd cheered them. Rincon scored in 41st minute, beating goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea with a low shot from 5 yards. Asprilla made it 2-0 a minute after halftime. Rincon added the second in the 73d.

Expectations are high that Israel and Jordan could reach a draft agreement of their own in the next few days. 1 SURVEYING DECADES OF HATRED Even during the depths of the cold war, neither Americans nor Russians looked across the Iron Curtain with the hatred that has so often fed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 6 SETTLERS FEELING IGNORED For most of the roughly 130,000 Isaelis living in settlements scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, this is a time of worry, uncertainty, fear and anger. 4 HOTTEST TICKET IN WASHINGTON In addition to the two parties and their delegations, close to 2,500 people have been invited to the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday morning. 1 A P.L.O. aide suggested that Yasir Arafat might attend the signing. 5 P.L.O. backers marched in Gaza to support mutual recognition. 4 Egypt draws great satisfaction from the pending peace agreement. 5 U.S. BLAMES SOMALI CROWD American and United Nations officials blamed Somali fighters who ambushed a United Nations convoy for the scores of civilian casualties incurred during a battle on Thursday in Mogadishu. 3 SERBS BARRAGE CROATIAN TOWN In some of the fiercest fighting in Croatia since war broke out there more than two years ago, Serbs pounded a garrison town in Croatia with artillery and vowed to retake three villages that were captured on Thursday in a Croatian attack. 3 POPE SKIRTS DISPUTE IN ESTONIA Winding up his tour of the Baltic republics, Pope John Paul II visited the Estonian capital and pointedly declined to respond to a call to back Estonia's campaign for the withdrawal of Russian troops. 3 A square blooms as a Brazilian city embraces historic preservation. 2 National 7-10 CLINTON HEALTH PLAN UNVEILED The President has settled on a plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans while vastly expanding Federal power to control private spending on medical care. 1 A MAJOR UNDERTAKING News analysis: The Administration's health care plan is imposing not just in its intricacy, but also in its political boldness. 1 HARD CHOICES FOR AMERICANS The many Americans who are already decently insured may have a hard time deciding about their prospects under the health proposal. 1 RESHAPING THE HEALTH INDUSTRY The Administration's plan could accelerate trends that are already reshaping the work of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. 10 RELENTING ON TRADE BATTLE The House majority whip retreated from his plans to use all the resources of his office against the North American Free Trade Agreement. 7 ACTION AFTER IMPLANT SETTLEMENT Dow Corning's announcement that it would settle lawsuits over its breast implants has prompted many women to call lawyers. 7 A BUSH AIDE FACES PUNISHMENT An aide to George Bush faces jail or fines for refusing to turn over records of her role in the search of Bill Clinton's passport files. 7 Jack Kevorkian assisted in another suicide. 7 Religion notes: The Middle East accord forced some new liturgy. 27 Metro Digest B1 Business Digest D1 Weekend C1-28 American fashion at the Met.

In this celebration of the latest collectible artifact for aging baby boomers, a team of Californians -- Roger Handy, Maureen Erbe, Aileen Antonier and Henry Blackham -- labors not very mightily to establish that the transistor radio is ""more than an icon for popular culture, a point of no return for American values, a seminal piece of technical wizardry and the first volley in the continuing skirmish of goods production between Japan and America."" References to Marcel Duchamp aside, their book seems less a serious attempt to see the transistor radio as ""an art form in its own right"" and more an excuse to fool around with what passed for space-age design in the era of the extravagantly tail-finned pink Cadillac. Whether you tucked it into an elegant leather handbag, a la Grace Kelly, or, taking a cue from Brandon de Wilde in ""Hud,"" let it poke out of a denim jacket, the transistor radio may not have been, as the authors playfully insist, ""integral . . . to the issues of defiance, sex, freedom, music and mobility.""

Clarke (5 carries for 104 yards) scored his other touchdown in the second quarter on a 73-yard scamper. Edgar Santana and Andre Wyatt (12 carries for 92 yards) were the Knights' other scorers, with Wyatt setting up his 1-yard touchdown with a 42-yard run. Santana (interception), Gary Miller (fumble recovery) and David Gibson (interception) were Kennedy's standouts on defense. THEY MEET AGAIN: Henry Renelus kicked a 42-yard field goal and Keon Russell returned a punt 27 yards for a score to lead MIDWOOD (1-0) over ERASMUS (0-1), 10-0, as the two teams renewed a rivalry that dates from 1947. The victory improved the Hornets overall record against Erasmus to 20-14-3. Fullback Patrick Champagne (11 carries for 72 yards) and tailback Mackise London (11 rushes for 63 yards) were Midwood's leading ground gainers, while Franklin Barnes (21 carries for 67 yards) led Erasmus' rushing attack. C.H.S.F.L. WINNING COMBINATION: Quarterback David Rodriguez (6 of 11 for 79 yards) threw two touchdown passes to tight end Michael Baptiste (4 catches for 114 yards) and ran for another to catapult CARDINAL SPELLMAN (1-0), over FORDHAM PREP (0-1), 18-14. Rodriguez rushed for 61 yards on 13 carries and threw scoring strikes of 11 yards and 27 yards to Baptiste. Rodriguez's counterpart, Brendan Higgins (8 of 19 for 158 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception), drew first blood on Fordham's second possession of the game, hitting Cliff Dealy (4 catches for 114 yards, 2 touchdowns) with a 47-yard touchdown toss. However, Fordham's lead was short-lived, as Spellman stormed back with three unanswered touchdowns, including a score on their next series. That score, an 11-yard Rodriquez touchdown run, capped off a 80-yard drive in the first quarter. Spellman's second touchdown resulted from an interception from linebacker Chris Williams, which he returned 14 yards to Fordham's 27-yard line. On the next play, Rodriguez hit Baptiste with 27-yard touchdown pass. Fordham narrowed the gap with 25 second left when Higgins threw his second touchdown to Dealy, from 10 yards out. Williams, who rushed for 81 yards on 11 carries for Spellman, led the way defensively from the linebacker position along with Abebe Lawrence, a defensive tackle, and Daniel Carr, a cornerback.

David Fonseca scored the winning goal during injury time at the end of the first half at Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, Uruguay. With only one round remaining in South American Group B, neither of the two berths is settled. Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay all have 10 points with Sunday's two games to decide the issue. Bolivia, once seemingly secure in its bid for a World Cup bid, and Brazil need a draw to qualify. Uruguay needs a victory, or a draw and a Bolivian loss, to get to next summer's World Cup in the United States. (AP) AUTO RACING Hill Wins in Italy as Prost's Engine Blows Damon Hill had a bad start and a good finish in the Italian Grand Prix yesterday in Monza, Italy. His French teammate, Alain Prost, had quite the reverse. Jean Alesi of France thrilled Italian fans by driving a Ferrari to second place, and Michael Andretti finished third, his best Formula One finish this year, in a McLaren-Ford. Andretti, who fought back in the second half of the race after spinning off in the second lap, said he was delighted to have made his first trip to the podium in Formula One. Prost, a 38-year-old French veteran, saw his Renault engine explode four and a half laps from the checkered flag and from his fourth world title. He led for 48 laps after roaring off from the pole position. (AP) Fittipaldi Is Still in the Race: Emerson Fittipaldi kept the Indy-car championship battle alive with a runaway victory in the Pioneer Electronics 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. It was a turnaround for Fittipaldi, who had been struggling since winning at Portland, Ore., on June 27, and a day of missed opportunities for PPG Cup point leader, Nigel Mansell, and Fittipaldi's teammate, Paul Tracy. Mansell, who went into the 199.3-mile, 89-lap race with a 34-point lead over Fittipaldi and a 47-point lead over Tracy, started from the pole and had a good chance to wrap up the championship with two races remaining. (AP) GOLF Birdie on 18th Gives Frost Canadian Title David Frost, given an opening by the back-nine collapse of Brad Bryant, two-putted for birdie on the final hole yesterday to win the Canadian Open by a stroke. The 34-year-old South African scored his seventh PGA Tour victory, closing with a four-under-par 68 for a 279 total on the Glen Abbey Golf Club course in Oakville, Ontario. (AP) Elements Are Kind to Murphy: First the weather took away some of Bob Murphy's weapons. Then it gave him his second victory on the Senior PGA Tour. Murphy became the winner of the GTE North Classic in Indianapolis when rain and lightning forced officials to cancel yesterday's final round of the 54-hole tournament. Murphy never had to take a club out of his bag to win with a 10-under 134. (AP) DOG SHOW Schnauzer Takes Top Honors A standard schnauzer, Ch.

Opening the Barnes Door","Like the pale blue gaze of Modigliani's ""Girl With a Polka-Dot Blouse"" (1919) and the weary gray eyes of van Gogh's ruddy postman ""Joseph-Etienne Roulin"" (1889), the beauty of the canvases in GREAT FRENCH PAINTINGS FROM THE BARNES FOUNDATION: Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and Early Modern (Knopf/Lincoln University, $65) baffles and mesmerizes. In this companion volume to the collection's first venture out of its Merion, Pa., gallery, works by Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne and Picasso make their first print appearance in gorgeous color and endow each page with revelations of exquisite nuance, astonishing detail, innovative technique and sheer intelligence. French and American scholars have contributed extensive and accessible notes about the artists' careers, the paintings' origins and their place within the Barnes collection. Paradoxically, the forewords and introductory essays to this brilliant array reveal that its esthetic bias somewhat belies the vision Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951) -- chemist, businessman, philanthropist, educator and adventurous collector -- strove to establish and communicate through his collection as a whole. Barnes was obsessed by the continuity of great art throughout the ages, and he delighted in conveying what he had discovered -- that, for example, Modigliani's figures echoed the elongated lines of African tribal masks. Thus his gallery showed ancient Chinese paintings, ceramics and old European masters next to the then-risque French paintings reproduced in this book, and next to the American Indian and African-American art, African sculptures and Mexican retablos he was among the first to collect. This illuminating context is sorely missed. This aside, though, the greatness of the French paintings shown here cannot be denied.",1993-09-19T05:00:00+0000

Ever since the Moorish invasions of Andalusia in the eighth century, North Africa has had a special significance for Spain; rightly or wrongly, it has come to symbolize one of the most exotic, least understood elements in the Spanish psyche. ""Mimoun,"" a slender first novel by the Valencian writer Rafael Chirbes, explores this otherness in the context of personal and social alienation. Originally published in Spain in 1988 and deftly translated by Gerald Martin, the novel recounts the adventures of Manuel, a bisexual Madrileno who spends the winter in Mimoun, a small Moroccan town near Fez. Mr. Chirbes's spare, impressionistic prose leads us through Manuel's desultory love affairs, his friends' dismal suicides, his exquisite sadness. The expatriate Europeans in this novel are at least as hard to fathom as Morocco itself, which in their troubled eyes is at once a mortal threat and a desolate refuge.",1993-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The new arrangement lets delegates vote when the House meets as a ""committee of the whole"" to do most of its legislating. But if anything is decided by a margin so narrow that delegate votes made the difference, another vote would follow automatically without the delegates.","That hasn't happened yet, but the Republicans were so flustered by the Democrats' ploy that they challenged its constitutionality in court.

us,A New Framework for Health Care,"To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. The Overseer A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. The Payers EMPLOYERS Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers. EMPLOYEES Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. GOVERNMENT Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. LARGE CORPORATIONS Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. The Brokers HEALTH ALLIANCES The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s. ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered. COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed. QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans. SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance. STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance. CORPORATE ALLIANCES If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their own alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employeees might have fewer providers to choose from. The Options Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service option offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,800 a year for an individual and $4,200 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in prices; people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O. The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subscribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay 40 percent of the bill. Combination Plan The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. The Benefits All Americans would be issued a ""health security card"" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Preventive care for children. Adult benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions. Eye & Ear: Routine vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: for terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices. when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents further deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illnes or injry. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive Care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not ""medically necessary or appropriate,"" citing cosmetic orthodntia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services. A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected Working, with good insurance Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as they received care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits beyond those in the standard package remain tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, uninsured Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, if family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. (The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Nonworkers or Unemployed Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with unearned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost of premium if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line. Part-time workers Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a pro-rated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-employed Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribution toward the employer share -- 80 percent of average premium cost -- they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax-deductible, compared to 25 percent now. Two-earner families In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute, and each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share -- 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household employee For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Retiree, under 65 The Government would subsidize retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. If not covered by former employer or pension plan, they could get coverage through the alliance and pay only 20 percent of the cost of an average premium, as though they were employed. Part-time work or a spouse's earnings would alter the subsidies. Medicare recipient The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or better current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in former health plan, paying any difference between Medicare contribution and plan cost. Medicaid recipients Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state governments would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment. Student Students attending school full-time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy, would sign up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage. Illegal immigrants Not eligible for coverage through the health alliances, but could still receive emergency and other care as they do now.",1993-09-23T05:00:00+0000

It was the second sanction against Olympique Marseilles. The European federation earlier this month excluded the team from defending its European Champions Cup title. The former manager, Jean-Pierre Bernes, who is charged with paying or trying to pay members of the Valenciennes team in northern France up to $43,000 to go easy on Marseilles in a match on May 20, was banned from the sport until further notice. The French soccer federation made its announcement under tomorrow's deadline imposed by FIFA, the sport's international governing body, to take action or be barred from global competition. France currently leads European Group 6 in qualifying play for the 1994 World Cup and is scheduled to play host to the 1998 World Cup finals. Further sanctions will hinge on the outcome of the trials of those charged, the French federation said. (AP) Norway Inches Closer to World Cup Berth: Norway closed in on its first World Cup berth in 55 years yesterday with a 1-0 victory over Poland in Oslo, and the Netherlands poured on the goals in San Marino, 7-0. Norway, on a 53d-minute goal by Jostein Flo, increased its lead to 3 points in Europe's Group 2, and needs only one victory or two ties in its remaining two games to advance to the World Cup finals for the second time, its previous appearance coming in 1938. The Netherlands, needing to win by five goals to move into second place in the same group, took care of matters in San Marino. The victory by the Netherlands dropped England into third place in Group 2 on goal differential. Norway leads the group with 14 points, with the Netherlands and England both with 11 points. All three teams have two games remaining, with England playing at the Netherlands on Oct. 13.

Two Views of Whitman: Florio's and Her Own","CANDIDATE: Jim FlorioPRODUCER: Gruenwald, Eskew and Donihlan, Washington.VISUAL: Opens with a photograph of Ms. Whitman against the background of an assault weapon being fired. Mrs. Whitman's picture remains on screen as a swerving, skidding car appears in background; then background now shows an assailant grabbing a young woman with ponytail in a parking lot.THE SCRIPT: ""Christine Todd Whitman wants to legalize certain assault weapons. Now another fact. Christine Todd Whitman has a proposal to weaken New Jersey's drunk driving laws. Instead of suspending their licenses, Whitman would issue some drunk drivers different colored license plants and let them drive again. But that's not all. With an epidemic of carjacking, Whitman is against mandatory sentences for carjackers. Assault weapons. Weaker drunk driving laws. No mandatory sentences for carjackers. Does Whitman even understand?ANALYSIS: The last words fairly drip with condecension, as if a slow student had been observed signing up for a Great Books course. As for accuracy, Mrs. Whitman's questioning of the effectiveness of some automatic sentencing laws -- along lines expressed by Attorney General Janet Reno, the Democrats own top law enforcer -- has been twisted to suggest she is soft on crime. For instance, a drunk driving conviction brings an automatic six-month suspension of driving privileges. She proposed that in special cases, as when a first-time offender's livelihood was dependent on driving, a color-coded license could be issued to allow travel between home and work. She said her concern was to preserve the individual's job and not force another family into costly social dependency, but that reasoned position is nowhere in sight here.CANDIDATE: Christine Todd WhitmanPRODUCER: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Agency, Washington.VISUAL: Mrs. Whitman, attired in a tailored red jacket, is shown in medium closeup, peering directly into the camera. She looks earnest, but she manages a smile at the conclusion of her remarks.THE SCRIPT: ""Jim Florio thinks this election is about fooling you with untrue negative ads. I say it's about fixing New Jersey's economy. So, as Governor I am going to cut your taxes every year for the next three years, 10 per cent each year for most people, less for those in the higher brackets. Cutting taxes will create more jobs and force Trenton to reduce spending. We know what Jim Florio's taxes and spending did to our economy. Now we have to clean up the mess. I'm Christine Whitman.""ANALYSIS: The tax cut gambit can be two-edged because, in these times, even voters who rely on television ads to make their choice can be cynical about campaign promises that sound too good to be true. For this one to fly, the promise has to be buttressed by substantive argument, perhaps using Perot-like pie charts to push the product and explain how such enormous budget cuts are possible. Otherwise it could boomerang by allowing Mr. Florio to portray the plan as a windfall for Republican fat cats. So far, however, Ms. Whitman has not mastered the art of TV pitchwoman. -- JOHN NORDHEIMER",1993-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Australia, advancing to the final for the 43d time, went up by 3-0 over India in the best-of-5 series in Chandigarh, India, when the reigning Wimbledon champions Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge routed India's Leander Paes and Ramesh Krishnan, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1. Germany, playing this year without Boris Becker, will make its fifth appearance in the final after taking a 3-0 lead at Borlange, Sweden. Michael Stich and Patrik Kuhnen beat Henrik Holm and Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7), to clinch the victory on an indoor clay court. The Australians have yet to lose a set to the Indians, who chose the grass courts at Chandigarh to stage the series. Wally Masur and Jason Stoltenberg beat Krishnan and Paes in the singles matches Friday. Germany wasn't fazed by Sweden's decision to hold the match on the indoor clay, or by the presence of the former No. 1 player, Stefan Edberg. Edberg lost to Marc Goellner in Friday's singles and Stich beat Magnus Gustafsson. ""If Boris wants, he's welcome to play,"" Stich said of the upcoming final. ""But it would not be fair because some other guy on this team will have to step down."" Becker's presence may not aid the Germans anyway, as the team captain Niki Pilic indicated the final could be played on clay, Becker's least favorite surface.

Colds and flus are endemic, as are back problems from hefting and carting young children all day. Under the Clinton plan, workers would get benefits from their employers, who would probably qualify for an expense cap of from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll. Self-employed family day-care providers would buy their own insurance but qualify for the 100 percent health insurance tax deduction.

us,The Subject Was Close to Home,"The French Impression-ist painter Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) was a deeply private person of legendary modesty and little interest in the world of men. A compulsive observer who leaned toward the azure blues and fiery reds of the Fauves, he was a painter who saw the exotic in the everyday. ""Art will never be able to do without nature,"" Bonnard once wrote, a belief emphasized in his diary, which in 20 years contained but three short reflections on society. Instead, its pages of crablike script were devoted to precise notations on the weather and scores of pencil sketches executed in or around his home at Le Cannet, the sun-drenched village in the south of France where he lived for most of each year. Jean Leymarie, an art historian and an acquaintance of Bonnard's, and Michel Terrasse, the painter's great-nephew, have coupled their memories of the painter, his house and gardens with more than 130 related illustrations, 77 in color, to illustrate the sources of Bonnard's art and methods. The result, BONNARD AT LE CANNET (Thames and Hudson, paper, $24.95), is a handsome book, unusual for the intimate portrait it presents of the painter's private world and for the poetry of its text, which shimmers with detail. Mr. Leymarie, in his preface, and Mr. Terrasse, in the main text, have caught small, significant moments -- snippets of conversation, the decorations of a room, the quality of light during an early morning stroll -- and shared them with the reader. The photographs have been arranged by setting and divided into sections (the garden, the dining room, the studio and so on), each introduced by a small drawing or a page from Bonnard's diary. Fourteen penetrating photographs of Bonnard in his rooms by Henri Cartier-Bresson echo the intense symbiosis between the artist and his domestic world. ""Every true artist finds the subjects that he needs,"" said Bonnard, who found them all close to home. ANDREA BARNET",1993-09-26T05:00:00+0000
