According to some telemarketing experts, however, the problem was that no one would have bought the premise that Norm was really speaking to them. ''It wasn't believable,'' says Mason Duchatschek, president of AMO Employer Services in St. Louis, who has been consulting on telesales for about a decade. For voice-mail marketing to work, he says, it must at least sound live. Paul LeBon, the author of ''Escape From Voicemail Hell: Boost Your Productivity by Making Voicemail Work for You,'' agrees. ''If you're going to cold-call, you've got to script it so that the message is personalized, like sending information about word-processing systems to a screenwriter.'' And you can't be a nuisance.

In a day game against the Nashua Pride at Riverfront Stadium in Newark (the Bears won, 10-9), Canseco first tied Juan Thomas of the Atlantic City Surf, who hit 33 in the league's inaugural season in 1998, and then he surpassed him with his second long ball of the afternoon. And since there were 53 more games left in the schedule, the new record was sure to grow much larger. Canseco, 36, who had three brief stints in the big leagues -- and is still being scouted by American League teams -- started as a pitcher but moved to other positions after he tore a rotator cuff.

The suit says the deputy sheriff threw Mr. Bunyea against a firetruck and onto the ground. Mr. Barile is Nicole's godfather, and Mr. LaScala is her grandfather. The men were charged with assault after trying to enter the firehouse. Although all charges were dropped, the plaintiff's lawyer, Joseph J. Tock, said the arrests damaged their reputations. They are seeking $21 million in damages. Elsa Brenner",2000-08-06T05:00:00+0000

The governor's office gave no reason for his departure. Mr. Consovoy, who has a history of heart trouble, has been on medical leave since mid-June, shortly after he was summoned to the governor's office for a meeting with her chief of staff. Since then, the attorney general's office, which is defending a lawsuit by inmates still awaiting the parole hearings that they were entitled to months ago, found about 2,800 inmates beyond their parole-eligibility dates who had not received hearings or were still awaiting a decision or release.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Whole Lot of Commentary Going On,"Benjamin Zucker's first novel, BLUE (Overlook, $40), is at once a spiritual challenge and a gorgeous typographical object. Echoing the style of the Talmud, the book presents a continuing narrative in the center of each right-hand page, where a passage from the Mishna -- ancient commentary on the Torah -- would ordinarily be placed. The protagonist of this core text, a New York gem merchant named Abraham Tal, specializes in giving advice to others. Unfortunately, he appears to be incapable of taking decisive action in his own life, most notably in the matter of setting a date to marry Rachel Beller, his girlfriend of many years. He is constantly at odds with his brother and partner, Tuviah, in a sibling rivalry that recalls numerous biblical antecedents. The central story is wreathed with commentaries, including those of Abe's mother and father, the impatient Rachel and a host of others both living and dead: Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Chief Crazy Horse, Modigliani, Isaac Luria, Bob Dylan and dozens more. Their remarks all begin with a word or phrase taken from the main text; the words attributed to them are a mixture of direct quotations, in italics, and the author's expertly constructed inventions of what they might have said. The left-hand pages all bear illustrations -- dazzling reproductions of Vermeers and Van Goghs, photographs of Kafka, Talmudic texts -- that preside over the profusion of stories, judgments and opinions on the facing pages. More than a novel, ''Blue'' may in fact be a collective meditation on character. Is Abraham Tal's inaction wrong, or is he merely waiting for something as yet unannounced? Is he a coward, or simply a man seduced by a vision of the infinite? The color blue, whether in a painting by Monet, Kafka's ''blue notebooks'' or the amazing 204-carat sapphire that graces the book's jacket, functions as a symbol of eternity. In the struggle to comprehend a secular life that somehow and always includes the divine, these many commentators, like Luria and his fellow cabalists in the holy city of Safed, all seem to be ''floating in their own prayer.''

Her psychological and artistic acumen are evident in the numerous portraits she painted during her six-decade career. ALICE NEEL (Abrams, $45), edited by Ann Temkin, a curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, underlines her commitment to portraiture, often despite changing trends in art. The book surveys Neel's range of subjects and unconventional approach to depicting children and families, along with her bold handling of sensitive subjects, from pregnant women to male frontal nudity. The essays present three portraits of the artist: as a woman seeking to forge meaningful connections between her art and personal life; as a product of the New Deal era who shared the democratic ideals of the Federal Art Project, in which Neel participated from 1935 to 1943; and as an opinionated chronicler of the New York art world in the 1960's and 70's, when she portrayed luminaries like Henry Geldzahler and Andy Warhol with a candor that has been compared to vivisection. Neel is also shown to be a keen social observer, who captured the gesture and dress of her day and achieved her declared goal of getting the ''person plus the zeitgeist.'' The composite view is rounded out with anecdotal accounts by sitters who posed for Neel and recall her working methods and tendencies, including talking incessantly during portrait sessions. What emerges from this study is the image of a colorful woman who unflinchingly bore witness to her age. Suzanne Ramljak",2000-08-06T05:00:00+0000

Make another slit perpendicular to the first just before the head, and a third at the tail. You can then lift off the top fillet, and after that lift off the head and bones.

Sinai Hospital in New York City where he worked and taught for thirty years. Dr. Sachdev dedicated his life to the healing of others with skill and profound kindness. He was 68 years old. Having survived the partition of India and Pakistan which resulted in exile from his birthplace and family home and loss of his eldest sister Dr. Sachdev went on to study Medicine at Amristar Medical College of the University of Punjab. He then served as a Surgeon Lieutenant for the Indian Navy after which time he completed residencies in both Otolaryngology and Neurosurgergy in both India and England. Dr. Sachdev also earned the title of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons from England in 1963 after which time he came to the United States at the age of 39 and completed an additional neurosurgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Sachdev quickly rose to a senior position in the Neurosurgery Department at Mt. Sinai where he acquired a reputation for both professional excellence and benevolence. During the course of thirty years practicing neurosurgery in Manhattan, he was named one of the ''Best Doctors in New York'' and one of the ''Best Doctors in America'' by New York Magazine for many years. Dr. Sachdev's legacy survives in all the students and residents he mentored at the Mt. Sinai School of Mediccine, including his two daughters, Ulka and Rivka. Despite a busy private practice, Dr. Sachdev cherished all opportunities to teach his residents and medical students, earning him a Best Teacher and Mentor Award by the neurosurgical residents at Mt. Sinai Hospital in 1992-1993. He approached education with an impressive fund of knowledge and, most notably, a sense of humor and charisma. From an early age, Dr. Sachdev had a star quality. In his earlier years of practicing medicine in India, Dr. Sachdev was the director of the Dramatic Club at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India. He was known for his powerful public presence and easily captured people's attention. Dr. Sachdev was sincerely loved by all of those whose lives he touched.

The party had planned to endorse Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is a close friend of Raymond Harding, the party chairman. But after Mr. Giuliani dropped out, the party threw its support behind Hillary Rodham Clinton over the Republican nominee, Representative Rick A. Lazio. The ad is a response to one by the Republican Leadership Council, a Washington group that helps finance moderate candidates. That ad spliced images of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan against shots of Mr. Lazio, implying that Senator Moynihan, a Democrat, supported Mr. Lazio. Mr. Moynihan unsuccessfully sought the ad to be dropped.

Take ours, for example. The current phase of American capitalism began on Nov. 9, 1989, with the formal collapse of socialism. Suddenly, there was no need to flavor the free market with a dash of something else. The little pockets of socialism that had been tolerated when socialism posed a threat now, overnight, seemed horribly retrograde. Why have your capitalism diluted when you can have it straight? Since then, as if by some marvelous coincidence, a lot of new technology has arrived to enhance market forces. The Internet is one such technology. It creates new markets and new competition in old markets and helps to put a better price on everything. In a few short years, it has pretty much gutted the principles of corporate socialism -- jobs for life, employee and customer loyalty, all for one and one for all -- and replaced them with Lord knows what.",2000-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; One Hat, Three Languages","To some, it lent a touch of style. Others thought it looked like a flowerpot. For Georges Batrakani, the Greek Catholic French-speaking Syrian businessman in Robert Sole's wonderfully evocative novel BIRDS OF PASSAGE (Harvill, $26), manufacturing the tarboosh -- or fez, as it is better known here -- was a method of acquiring wealth in early 20th-century Cairo. Sole, a French journalist who was born in Cairo, follows four generations of the Batrakani family in Egypt, using their triumphs and tragedies to recreate a place and time long gone. Sole deftly weaves the family's history into a tapestry of a colorful and complicated era in Egypt, one marked by ethnic and religious diversity, world wars, occupying powers and, finally, the nationalism and independence that will lead to the tarboosh's demise there -- and to the departure of the Batrakanis and many other families. Told through the eyes of a grandson who makes good use of a relative's diary, the novel, ably translated from French by John Brownjohn, has characters as exotic as the setting. Among them are Georges himself, a Levantine who, in the eyes of a friend, ''hovered between two cultures, juggled with three languages and possessed no well-defined status of his own.'' Maggi, Georges's sister-in-law and occasional lover, is as sensuous as anyone in Lawrence Durrell's ''Alexandria Quartet.'' And Ferdinand, Georges's overweight brother, gives a memorable demonstration of the proper way to eat molokhiya, a garlic-flavored dark green soup.

Norman Mailer was a young World War II veteran with a story to tell in 1948 when this hefty novel, his first, was published. On page 6 of The Book Review, David Dempsey, found it ""the most ambitious novel to be written about the recent conflict'' and ""the most ruthlessly honest.'' "" 'The Naked and the Dead' is not a great book,'' this early evaluation concluded, ""but indisputably it bears witness to a new and significant talent among American novelists.'' The novel has been reissued in a 50th anniversary edition with a new introduction by Mailer. Picador has also reissued WHY ARE WE IN VIETNAM? ($13) a Mailer novel from 1967, when he was well established as Celebrity Writer. Vietnam itself is not mentioned until the last page of the novel, which chronicles the Alaska hunting trip of two soldiers-to-be, who set out to prove their virility in various ways. Anatole Broyard said in these pages that it ""may be a third-rate work of art, but it's a first-rate outrage to our sensibilities.''",2000-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Examining the fashion, food and design of air travel, he recalls the hot pants and knee boots worn by Southwest Airlines stewardesses in the early 70's and celebrates the beauty of the sushi served in club class on Nippon Airways flights. He also marvels at the $2 million makeover that a hot young designer, Marc Newson, gave a private jet a couple of years back. The $42 million plane looks like an airborne version of Canteen, a SoHo restaurant designed by Mr. Newson, but it is no more exotic than an animal-print 747 ""tiger lounge"" bar built for Boeing as a prototype in 1972.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The First Bourgeois Paradise,"When the Impressionists immortalized Argenteuil in the late 19th century, they became the first avant-garde artists to celebrate the suburbs. Claude Monet lived and painted in the town from 1871 to 1878, and painters like Alfred Sisley, Auguste Renoir, Edouard Manet and Gustave Caillebotte joined him in Argenteuil, eight miles north of Paris, to depict boats on the Seine, lush gardens and factory smokestacks. In THE IMPRESSIONISTS AT ARGENTEUIL (Yale University, $50), Paul Hayes Tucker writes that the combination of rural and urban elements perfectly suited the Impressionist aim of portraying modern life with its attendant contradictions. At the same time, Tucker, who teaches art history at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, also implies it was the presence of Monet that lured other artists out of the city for a bit of friendly competition, though Monet clearly had the last word on Argenteuil. The paintings depict few tensions between city and country, however. Monet and his colleagues transformed industrial structures like the town's railroad bridge into neo-Classical monuments to French civilization and hid urban sprawl behind flower bushes. Tucker tries to locate mysterious symbols and murky relationships stirring just beneath the surface of these bright and airy canvases, but in the process he misses a greater irony: in ostensibly bucking academic demand for timelessness in art, the Impressionists instead created an enduring vision of bourgeois paradise.

It was named Icoarosaurus Siefkeri, for Mr. Siefker, and put in the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. But now Mr. Siefker, 56, is ailing and needs money for medical bills. So the fossil will be offered for sale by Butterfields Auctioneers in a simulcast auction in San Francisco and Los Angeles on Aug. 27. The minimum bid is $250,000.

The better-than-expected increase in economic activity was fueled by a consumer spending spree resulting from falling unemployment and higher real wages, rising oil prices and the continuing dynamism of the United States economy -- Mexico's principal export market. President Ernesto Zedillo, above, who hands over the presidency to Vicente Fox on Dec. 1, said the data reinforced his promise that the transfer of power would be the first in Mexico in 25 years that would not be accompanied by an economic crisis.

An architectural jewel in the heart of Provence, Beaucaire was pretty much left to decay when its fortunes turned some 150 years ago. Its tarnished reputation grew worse in the last 40 years as low-income housing began to creep into the city center. Now the town fathers are hoping to change this image by offering newly renovated historical buildings to artists and artisans for monthly rents of less than 25 cents a square foot. At those prices, why not go for 6,400 square feet of studio space, as Mark Stuart, an Australian artist, did. He has moved into a 17th-century building overlooking a tranquil square in the heart of town. And officials are also hoping to make it easy for artists and artisans to buy. Beaucaire's winding streets, basking in the hot southern sun, have Roman roots, medieval touches and an abundance of stunning mansions from the grand period of commercial glory. Under the plan devised by the local government, even foreign applicants can qualify. They just have to be officially recognized as artists or artisans.

Per share figures reflect an increase in the number of shares outstanding. Sales rose 28 percent, to $2.67 billion, from $2.09 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1999. Taking into account the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options, Agilent had pro forma earnings per share of 33 cents, equal to the consensus estimate provided by First Call.

That is because in cyberspace, each digital packet of data is generally treated identically to each of the others; at a company, the chairman's urgent e-mail message may well be delayed as an intern browses the Web for sports scores. Yesterday, however, a small private company, Aplion Networks Inc. introduced the first entrants in a line of products meant to change that. Aplion's first products are meant to sit on the edge of a business customer's network and help set priorities for use of the network. E-mail, for instance, could be given higher priority than Web surfing, for instance, or certain users could be given higher priority than others.

Notebaert, former chairman of the Ameritech Corporation, has agreed to become chief executive of Tellabs Inc., the medium-sized maker of communications equipment. Mr. Notebaert takes the reins on Sept. 18. Michael J. Birck, one of the company's founders and the current chief executive, will give up that title and become the company's chairman. Previously, Tellabs did not have a chairman, though Mr. Birck filled that role informally. Mr. Notebaert, 53, left Ameritech, one of the Bell local phone giants, when that company was acquired last year by SBC Communications Inc. The move to Tellabs may be fitting because Ameritech was based in Chicago while Tellabs is based in Lisle, Ill., a Chicago suburb. Tellabs has long been more respected for its technology than for its business acumen. The company is best known for its products that connect fiber optic communications rings to one another. From a business standpoint, however, the company's acquisitions generally have not been fantastically successful. Tellabs shares rose $1.0625, to $62.6875, yesterday in Nasdaq trading.

The pork or chicken for the sandwiches is aged for several hours in a barbecue sauce that tastes of smoke. The secret to the sandwiches, and to the tender barbecue ribs, is the touch of vinegar in the Carolina-style sauce, said owner Lou Bottone, who opened Island Wraps, Seafood and BBQ in Belmar and Wanna Eat on the Bradley Beach boardwalk this past spring. He aimed the luncheonette-style stores at beachgoers who want to pop off the sand and find good food at a reasonable price. And a barbecue sandwich or ribs with a side order of waffle fries for a total of $6 is just that. For those not into meat, grilled yellowfin tuna sandwiches or platters and salads are available, as are turkey and roast beef in tortilla wraps, and fried shrimp and shrimp cocktails, and a few desserts. For less than $10, a patron can get more than enough to eat and wash it down with a bottle of water. On weekends, Mr. Bottone also makes beef brisket, which takes about six hours to prepare; it's available in a sandwich or on a platter. KAREN DEMASTERS",2000-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Style; Learning the Ropes,"There's a very easy litmus test to differentiate the designers who are on a lifelong odyssey* of aesthetic-altering proportions and the designers who are just churning out shmattes. Here's what you do: Head over to Bergdorf Goodman, or Saks, or any store that carries the widest selection of designers you're curious about. Pick one designer outfit from each rack. Better yet (we don't want any cheating), have a sales clerk or a friend pick for you. Then heap them all in a ''Farenheit 451''-style pile in the center of the floor. Now, try to pick out each designer's work. No looking at labels. And no using cell phones for a lifeline. Not easy, is it? I'd suggest that history has left us with maybe 40 designers whose work, no matter what the season, is instantly recognizable. Some of those designers -- like Gianfranco Ferre or Norma Kamali or Geoffrey Beene -- are out of favor with trendy fashion, though the strength of their signatures is undeniable. As the Pegasuses and LVMH's and YSL-Gucci's acquire and desire labels, I would counsel them to hesitate before backing any name that can't pass the style pile test. Of course, the nine designers included here pass with flying colors. -AMY M. SPINDLER",2000-08-20T05:00:00+0000

''It's like, Who's pulling our strings, y'all?'' she asked. ''Satan tries to pull our strings just the way we manipulate our little puppets.'' For effect, she gave the puppet, which looks like the head of a 90-year-old woman mounted on the body of a Betsy Wetsy, a tug. Her audience laughed approvingly.

us,The View From the Bridge,"The Ibar River runs across the high plains of Kosovo and passes slowly under the five bridges of Mitrovica. Here, more than a year after international peacekeepers arrived in the province, the United Nations has turned the narrow, dirty brown meander of the Ibar into a border: south is the Albanian side of town, north, the Serbian. Before the war, Albanians and Serbs lived in neighborhoods scattered on both sides of the river, and citizens were free to move back and forth over the Ibar. But the aftermath of war and a fragile peace have brought a new and segregated reality to the divided city. North of the river, north of Mitrovica, the farms and villages are almost exclusively Serbian, and yet farther north lies Serbia itself; the river is the frontier, and a symbol for both sides of the claims and counterclaims to land and history and belonging. And now, in Mitrovica, the purpose of the bridges spanning the river has been inverted; the tumbles of razor wire and the armed checkpoints and the idling tanks of international peacekeepers are positioned to make sure the Ibar is not crossed.

The annual vintage-car race begins and ends in Brescia, which is where the actress Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) was supposed to meet the crew. She never showed, leaving a lot of amazing designer clothes with no one to wear them. The model Nina Heimlich was imported from London to fill in. Problem solved? Not quite. The Aston Martin that had been promised wasn't available, as it was in the race. Its stand-in, a silver Porsche 550 Spyder (the James Dean model) from the Porsche museum in Stuttgart, Germany, was unceremoniously reclaimed and then returned to our team after heated negotiations. Another car that we were expecting broke down. A gull-wing Mercedes-Benz 300 SL was ultimately located, but the truck transporting it became lost, and it arrived four hours late. The shoot was then interrupted by pouring rain. When the photographer finally took his last shot, the Porsche unhooked from the camera truck and rolled downhill toward the Mercedes. The model in the driver's seat didn't know how to hit the emergency brake. Crew members sprinted to the Porsche and stopped it inches from the bumper of the Mercedes. Maybe Kate Hudson is clairvoyant.2. In 1926, two scions of Brescia nobility raced the train to Milan in their sports cars and decided to make a sport of it. They teamed up with a local auto enthusiast and a journalist and produced the first Mille Miglia on March 26, 1927. The race, on unpaved roads, was won by Nando Minoja in an O.M.

The other participants were the village of Maybrook in Orange County and the Bethpage Water District in Nassau County. The judges were about 100 pedestrians who were walking by. ''I really can't say why we didn't win,'' said Mary Anne Wyatt-Dolan, chief chemist for the Yonkers water system. Yonkers won last year and has won six times in the 1990's. One factor may have been the use of surface water, which can take on a grassy or fishy taste in summer from algae growing in reservoirs, she said. Suffolk uses ground water.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Up From Sweet Potatoes,"J. R. Salamanca's deft and sprightly new novel, THAT SUMMER'S TRANCE (Welcome Rain, $24.95), is full of theatrical flourishes. Indeed, the book's protagonist, Ben Oakshaw, was once a talented actor and is now the owner of a major Washington advertising agency; he has deliberately buried ''the true and terrible privation of his youth,'' which was spent on a Florida sweet potato farm, in ''a skillful impersonation'' of success so convincing that it almost -- but never completely -- quiets his sense of inadequacy and self-doubt. When Jill, his lover during his student days at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, writes and stars in a hit play that recreates their break-up, Ben fears his wife, Priscilla, will learn the truth about his messy past. Instead, the guileless, gracious Priscilla invites Jill and her companion, Tony, an older, somewhat enigmatic British journalist, to join the Oakshaws at their magnificent beach house at Cape Hatteras. Their visit unfolds at a seasonal, summer pace -- some 400 leisurely pages of intelligent and witty conversation generated by this privileged and seemingly satisfied four. The mood of ''That Summer's Trance'' is enhanced by Salamanca's abundant lyrical descriptions of water and weather, sky and shore; at one point, ''the pound and wash of the distant surf added to their conversation the ceaseless, darkling discourse of the sea.'' At another, ''the soft billows of the clouds were gradually . . . gathered into a vast, lustrous darkness, like a sable sea.'' There are undercurrents of passion, deception and self-delusion that never quite rupture the surface but subtly threaten this idyllic world. While the story is told from Ben's point of view, it is the charismatic, unconventional and somewhat unstable Jill who dominates. Salamanca maintains a nuanced tension between the two, and their partners, that keeps his ''actors'' a bit off balance, with twists of plot and perception right to the very end.

The layoffs, completed last week, are expected to save the company $8 million to $12 million a year.

The Democrats in Los Angeles reversed the process, giving the Kennedy-Jackson wing of the party plenty of air time but little consolation in the platform. Nevertheless, it is clear that there are measurable differences between the two candidates on domestic policy, and that on issue after issue the Democrats would still urge a more vigorous deployment of federal resources to solve national problems.

''Traveling alone is one of the great pleasures in life,'' said Marden, who has also traveled extensively with her family. And the living room of the Mardens' Manhattan town house -- she calls it ''my cave'' -- has become a richly illustrated album of those journeys. Though the room contains furniture ranging from early American to Eames, and art by Franz Kline, Richard Tuttle and Marden herself, it mostly reflects Marden's longtime fascination with India. ''I could go there every year, and I'd be happy,'' she said. ''It's so ancient and it's so sensual.'' So it would seem, from the room's profusion of sinuously sculptured deities, sexually explicit Tantric paintings and ritual phallic symbols.

Such clouds, known as planetary nebulae, are blasted from dying stars about the mass of the sun, but the stars in M15, some 12 million years old, were thought to be too light to engage in such pyrotechnics. Because more massive stars evolve and burn out faster than lighter ones, astronomers deduced that there should not be any stars as massive as the sun still burning in M15.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MERRITT, VERNON III","MERRITT-Vernon III, a photojournalist for Life magazine, died on August 17 from an accident at his home in Old Lyme, CT, age 59. Merritt's coverage of the civil rights movement and the early days of the Viet Nam war represent an important-and lastingcontribution to American photography. Merritt, who was from Montgomery, AL, studied journalism at the University of Alabama and graduated from Art Center School in Los Angeles. He returned to the South in 1963. He was among the first to document voter registration drives and Birmingham's segregation protests. His pictures appeared in Newsweek, the Saturday Evening Post, and Life. When Tuskegee schools were ordered to integrate, he joined black students on their first day at their new school. The bus carrying them was waylaid by a white mob, including the local sheriff. Merritt was taken from the bus, beaten, threatened with lynching and jailed. Merritt was one of the first journalists drawn to the war in Viet Nam. He went as a free-lance, his photographs handled by the agency Black Star. In 1965, he was wounded by sniper fire, an injury that left him partially paralyzed for some months. When he recovered and was able to work again, Life magazine hired him as a staff photographer. He remained with the magazine until it ceased publication in 1972. At Life, his work encompassed the breadth of American life-the uninhibited lifestyle of the '60s, the capture of Charles Manson, the home life of the astronauts, an epic essay on the trumpeter swan, the American farmer, and one of his personal favorites-a pampered pig on a pillowy couch. He was an adventurous sailor, a member of the Cruising Club of America, who had recently sailed his sloop Talisman, to Greenland. He is survived by his wife, Linda Stanley of Old Lyme, CT and three children, Kimberley Salido of San Gabriel, CA, Vernon (Kip) Merritt IV of Highland Lakes, NJ, and Blaine Caravaggi of NY, NY. A memorial service will be held Saturday, September 9 at the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme, 2 Ferry Road, at 12:30 PM.

Federal District Judge Jed S. Rakoff ruled that damages would be assessed for copyright violations of each compact disc, not for every individual song that was infringed by Mp3.com, as the recording industry had wanted. Universal and four other major record labels sued MP3.com in January, saying it had made illegal digital copies of songs available on its site. In April, Judge Rakoff ruled against MP3.com, saying it had infringed record company copyrights. MP3.com has settled with four of the record companies. Matt Richtel (NYT)",2000-08-25T05:00:00+0000

He picks his sports bets by writing team names on a piece of paper, then carefully tearing it up and flinging the scraps into the air. He bets on the teams whose names are on the pieces he grabs. It's as imaginative a way to play out a gambling addiction as has been seen in the movies in a long time. This crazy character moment comes early enough in the picture to make the audience believe there is more such characterization ahead. There isn't, though. ''Spent'' coasts on that gesture and then finally runs out of steam.",2000-08-25T05:00:00+0000

If survival had really been at stake, the first thing the 16 contestants would have done last March, when the show was taped in the South China Sea, was take hostage the CBS camera crew and the host, Jeff Probst, and demand $16 million for their release.

Then, an hour before our scheduled landing, the pilot announced that one set of the plane's landing wheels would not descend. But, he assured us, he could land the plane safely on two wheels. Although fire trucks would meet us on the ground, he said, there was no need to be concerned. They were simply being cautious. They liked to use occasions like this for practice. Was there really nothing to worry about? I wondered. None of the other passengers seemed particularly concerned.",2000-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Now, after one of the most painstaking investigations in the history of aviation, the National Transportation Safety Board has ruled out those possibilities. Instead, the board determined that a ''fuel/air explosion inside the center wing tank'' was the probable cause of the Boeing 747's breaking up in midair off Long Island 12 minutes into its flight from Kennedy Airport to Paris on July 17, 1996.

Since the early 1970's, the tuna have declined -- along with cod, swordfish, halibut and so many other species in the ruined fisheries of the Northeast. Sorlien, like the other fishermen in this harbor just west of Newport, is surviving thanks to New England's great cash crop, lobsters, but he wonders how much longer they'll be around. ''Right now, my only incentive is to go out and kill as many fish as I can,'' Sorlien said.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Making It Big in Hair,"Tananarive Due's graceful historical novel, THE BLACK ROSE (Ballantine, $25.95), traces the life of Madame C. J. Walker (1867-1919), nee Sarah Breedlove, a penniless girl from Delta, La., who became America's first black female millionaire. This book is based on research and an outline left behind by Alex Haley, who planned to write a novel about Walker; Due, a former columnist for The Miami Herald and the author of two previous novels, has taken the material and made it her own. Walker was orphaned at 6, married at 14 and was widowed a few years later; she was a washerwoman and cook until, in her late 30's, she married a Denver businessman named Charles Walker in 1906. By her death at the age of 51 she was, after starting her own hair care company, extraordinarily wealthy. Sarah's business began with experiments to treat her own hair loss and itchy scalp; thanks to word-of-mouth advertising, the company flourished and eventually employed some 20,000 ''Walker agents'' throughout the country. No retiring mogul, Walker financed a mission school in Africa, stumped for the N.A.A.C.P., sued a movie theater for charging blacks higher ticket prices than whites and built an Italian Renaissance-style palace in upstate New York as her home and as her ''monument to Negro achievement.'' Due's book resists becoming a facile Horatio Alger story: We follow the estrangement between Sarah and her daughter, and watch as Sarah courts the man who would become her second husband, despite our suspicion that he might be a poor companion. ''Maybe when you've lost as much as me, you don't take happy for granted,'' Sarah says. ''You scrape and hoard every piece of happy that comes your way.'' Charles Wilson",2000-08-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Fairies, Demons and Pigs","Sara Rath's album THE COMPLETE PIG: An Entertaining History of Pigs (Voyageur, $29.95) contains enough eccentric pig lore to leave the browser giddy with pleasure. And browsing is in order. While the longer accounts of pigs in history, art and literature are just fine, the reader is constantly delayed by seductive little sidebars, like an entry on singing pigs in the court of Louis XI. (Pigs of assorted sizes and ages were attached to a sort of keyboard; when the keys were pressed, little spikes stabbed the animals, making them vocalize. It seems to have been one of the few things to amuse this 15th-century monarch.) Or instruction on how to say ''oink'' in 19 languages (try ''groin groin'' in French, ''rok-rok'' in Croatian or the unlikely ''buubuu'' in Japanese). Or a list of Italian pig curses, graded by degree of blasphemy (''porca miseria,'' ''pig misery,'' is suitable for use by children). A particularly rich chapter, ''Fairy Pigs, Demon Swine: Folktales, Superstitions and Saints,'' provides a separately boxed story of how St. Anthony Abbot came to have a pig for a pal, thereby qualifying him as the patron of swine and swineherds. The same section also tells us that in some cultures pigs are regarded as such bad news that they cannot even be named -- in some parts of China, the working euphemism is ''long-nosed generals.'' The illustrations, drawn from old posters, drawings and photographs ancient and modern, range from sweetly innocent pink piglets to a terrifyingly fanged wild boar. It is impossible to choose a favorite, but among the species depicted, it is hard to resist the adorably (or horribly) wrinkled Minzhu from China. One supposes that they look as much like long-nosed generals as anything else on God's green earth. Sarah Ferrell",2000-08-27T05:00:00+0000

But to the rest of the world the game is better known for its sex-symbol superstars with over-the-top style. Now, the look seen in niche magazines like Soccer World is spreading to the mainstream. Spiky gelled hair, splashy team jerseys and sneakers with king-size tongues are being paraded by teens whose parents emigrated from serious soccer countries, as well as by boy bands like 'N Sync, Take 5 and Youngstown, a pop band that adopted soccer style while touring in Europe last year. ''Club kids and wannabe rappers are starting to buy the jerseys because they're tight-fitting, shiny, and the material absorbs sweat,'' said Paul Castro, 17, who was born in Ecuador and works at Shoot 'N Score, a soccer specialty store in Jersey City, which sells hard-to-come-by foreign brands like Kappa and Lotto. Meanwhile, Puma, Dolce & Gabbana and Emporio Armani are introducing soccer-inspired sneakers this fall, with bright colors and oversize tongues. Adidas's classic Sambas are being snapped up by fashion stylists and rock stars, including Dave Grohl, lead singer of Foo Fighters. ''Teens in America are embracing their different ethnic backgrounds,'' said Sammy Lopez, 23, a singer with Youngstown, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico.

He was also a member of the Executive Board of Local 2 of the Liquor Salesmen's Union, where he sponsored incentives to help distillery workers & salesmen. Born in a farmhouse in Manchester, CT. of immigrant parents from what was then Palestine, Jack spent the early part of his life with five brothers and two sisters, attending a one room schoolhouse, and raising prize winning grapes and dairy cattle. In 1929, he left the family farm to move to New York, where he worked as a welder and master sheet metal craftsman. In the years prior to WWII, while working with his hands during the day, Jack donated his evenings teaching mechanical drafting at New York's Mechanics Institute.

He is survived by son Paul J.

The cuts come after a group of investors provided the company with a much needed $27.5 million cash infusion last week. Drkoop.com laid off 35 percent of its staff in May. ''Drkoop's tremendous sales and marketing expenses, coupled with the lack of success they've had in getting a significant revenue stream from advertisers has led them to this point,'' said Rachel Terrace, a health analyst with Jupiter Communications. ''When the investors took over, they said they wanted to start running drkoop like a business, and their first order of business, to lay off employees, is not surprising.''

The survey of 66 North American online retailers, conducted by the Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org, a trade association for Internet retailers, also found, however, that acquisition costs were higher in the second quarter than the $35 a customer found in the third quarter of 1999, when the survey was first conducted. Conversion rates -- the proportion of online customer visits that turn into actual orders -- as well as the rate of repeat customers, improved slightly, according to the study. ''These key economic factors are all marginally up, but in aggregate they'll have a significant impact for online retailers as they try to achieve profitability,'' said James Vogtle, the director of e-commerce research at Boston Consulting.

Child-friendly plastic stools, bright children's chairs and affordable hand-blown glass vases in a rainbow of colors are just a few of the new designs that were shown. Some of the high-voltage energy came from the designers themselves, many of them young and marketing their work directly to consumers on the Internet. And since home furnishing trends are said to follow fashion, both are looking youthful this season. ''Co-purchasing -- children shopping with parents -- is a millennial trend,'' said William Strauss, a generational historian and co-author of ''Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation'' (Vintage Books, September 2000). ''This is an optimistic generation,'' he said, with considerable buying power. Children are being consulted on purchases from computers to home furnishings, he continued, adding, ''Parents want their homes to be kid-friendly.''",2000-08-31T05:00:00+0000
