us,"Pop/Jazz; Conjuring Up The Founder, Jimi Hendrix","It's impossible to listen to rock-and-roll today without hearing the ghost of the guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Using the grammar of blues and rhythm-and-blues, Hendrix wrote the rules of modern rock. His improvisations, coarse and nasty or smoothly passionate, glorifed the noise and textures of the electric guitar, in the process elevating the instrument to its premier position in pop music. Working with the most basic of rock instrumentation, the trio, he took harmonic and textural liberties that have defined self-confident, risky excess to this day. On a cultural level, he translated a black performance esthetic into one for white youths. And he wrote hits, the sort that probably wouldn't have made it to the radio today; Hendrix was both a product of and definer of the 1960's.",1989-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Alison on Dominick St. ** (Aug. 18, 1989), 38 Dominick Street (727-1188) - This is a simple, harmonious place to dine, with pastel-colored walls holding black-and-white photographs, royal blue banquettes and indirect lighting. Cuisine of southwestern France is the focus, and during the game season, venison surfaces on the menu. As an appetizer, there is a tartare seasoned with capers, shallots and mustard oil. As an entree, there is a roast loin served with spatzle and a fava bean puree. Appetizers range from $7 to $14, main courses $17 to $28. Lunch, noon to 2:30 P.M. Mondays to Fridays; dinner, 6:15 to 11 P.M. Mondays to Thursdays, until 11:30 P.M. Fridays and Saturdays. Aquavit ** (Feb. 5, 1988), 13 West 54th Street (307-7311) - This Scandinavian establishment is a striking modern setting, with an informal cafe on the upper level and, on the lower level, a soaring space with birch trees reaching to an eight-story glass-walled atrium. At a time of year when diners seek out lusty game dishes, Aquavit features an enticing version of venison. Sauteed, cut in thin slices and shaped in a fan, it is set on a cream-apple sauce and served with lingonberries, morels and celery root puree. Prix fixe $35 for lunch; $60 for dinner. Lunch, noon to 2:30 P.M. Mondays to Fridays (until 3 P.M. upstairs); dinner, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Mondays to Saturdays (until 10 P.M. upstairs). Au Troquet * (Dec. 9, 1988), 328 West 12th Street (924-3413) - Au Troquet is everyone's idea of a romantic little French restaurant in Greenwich Village, with its white-framed windows and lacy curtains. Its moderately priced menu emphasizes the cuisine of Provence. Venison is given a classic treatment. Having been marinated in wine, herbs and vegetables for several days, the medallions are sauteed and served with a juniper berry sauce, pureed chestnuts and a vegetable garnish. Appetizers $4.25 to $6.75; entrees $14.50 to $21.75. Dinner, 6 to 11 P.M. Mondays to Saturdays. Felidia ** (Sept. 16, 1988), 243 East 58th Street (758-1479) - This elegant two-story restaurant, specializing in food from the northern Adriatic area, buzzes every night with a well-heeled crowd. What is listed on the menu as venison squazet is a stew with a red-wine sauce, served with one's choice of gnocchi, polenta or pasta. Another venison dish is sauteed fillet in a Barolo sauce, served with vegetables and chestnut puree. Appetizers range from $10 to $15; main courses from $17 to $27. Lunch, noon to 3 P.M. Mondays to Fridays; dinner, 5 to midnight Mondays to Saturdays. Le Perigord *** (June 16, 1989), 405 East 52d Street (755-6244) - The dining room is soft and spacious, with beige-and-pink flowered wall fabric, leather chairs and bursts of fresh flowers. The food is scintillating and the service exemplary. Noisettes of venison, complemented by a fresh cranberry and poivrade sauce, are served with both a chestnut and a celery root puree. When the chef is further inspired, he prepares a warm terrine of venison pate enclosed in puff pastry and topped with truffle sauce. Prix-fixe dinner $48. Lunch, noon to 3 P.M. Mondays to Fridays; dinner, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Mondays to Saturdays.",1989-12-01T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Serving Game Birds,"Game birds, extremely lean and low in fat, are becoming increasingly popular, especially for holiday meals. Those sold at retail or served in restaurants are raised on farms or ranches and do not have a strong, ''gamey'' flavor. It's illegal to sell domestically hunted game, but a small amount of shot game is coming in from Scotland, particularly grouse and pheasant. Woodcock is not available commercially, but licensed hunters with permits can shoot them. When roasted or grilled, game birds should be basted, and those with dark flesh cooked no more than medium-rare. Dark-fleshed birds have a rich, almost beefy flavor. Light-flesh birds are closer in flavor to chicken. Overcooking will make any game bird tough and dry. Braising and stewing are other cooking methods. Here's a guide to how many birds you will need for a serving. $ Bird Meat Color Birds per Serving Quail Dark Two to three Squab Dark One Grouse Dark One Woodcock Dark One Partridge Light One Guinea hen Light Half Mallard duck Dark Half Pheasant Light One-third to a half Muscovy duck Dark Up to a quarter Wild turkey Dark Up to one-sixth",1989-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Smith's liver and used it to replace her daughter's diseased organ. The operation was closely watched by transplant surgeons who hope to use the technique to save more of the 700 babies who are born each year with liver disease. Until now, all liver transplants in the United States involved cadavers, which are in short supply. Since the liver regenerates itself, a portion taken from a parent or sibling will grow with the child, and the donor's liver will grow back to normal. Doctors pronounced Alyssa's transplant a success and predicted that she would be home for Christmas. Said the chief surgeon, Dr. Christoper E. Broelsch, ''The liver is going to function right away.

As a non-Japanese in a quintessentially Japanese sport, the huge wrestler has heard more than a few unkind comments during his five-year career. A few years ago, a former sumo champion said Konishiki's rise was ''a shame for Japan.'' And, in tones reminiscent of Americans who once bemoaned the fate of boxing dominated by black champions, a Japanese novelist said that if the Hawaiian were accorded the sport's top rank, ''sumo tournaments should be called off.''

June 6, 1989: McCaw said it would begin a cash tender offer of $120 a share, or $6.5 billion, for Lin. McCaw already owned 9.8 percent of Lin. June 20: Lin rejected McCaw's offer.

July 13: McCaw said it might raise its bid for Lin to $127.50 a share. July 21: McCaw decided to proceed with its $110-a-share offer.

Sept. 3: The Federal Communications Commission refused to block McCaw's hostile takeover offer for Lin. Sept. 11: Lin said it would merge its cellular telephone operations with those of the BellSouth Corporation. Analysts estimate the value of the complex deal at up to $12.5 billion.

Nov. 14: McCaw said two dozen institutions would provide it with $3 billion to help finance its offer for controlling interest in Lin. Nov. 20:McCaw sweetened its bid for Lin by offering $150 in cash for 22.5 million shares, or 46 percent, of Lin's stock. Dec 4:Lin accepted McCaw's offer of $154.11 a share for 21.9 million shares.

A simple transparent stain would help restore the color but would not provide much protection against water penetration and soiling. These redwood furniture coatings do provide that kind of protection. They come in clear or semi-opaque versions, with pigment added to help retain or restore the original color to the wood. Insulating Pipes Q.Our water pipes run through an unheated crawl space under the house, and sometimes it takes more than 45 seconds to get hot water to the upstairs - a huge waste of water and gas. Is it feasible to insulate these pipes, and if so, what kind of insulation should I use? A.Insulating the pipes under the house is definitely a good idea. You can use flexible foam insulating sleeves, which are sold in all plumbing supply outlets and in most home centers.

At 9, the same boy grew restless, though not during the rap or video sketches, at Bill Irwin's 70-minute ''Largely New York.'' (Perhaps post-modernist clowning has yet to sift down to elementary schools.) When a show loses children's attention, they don't hesitate to say so. A 5-year-old otherwise held rapt by ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway'' turned to me during a monotonous song (I won't name it) and asked, ''When will this part end?'' At one confusing moment in ''Les Miserables'' - when it is portentously announced that a heretofore unmentioned offstage character, General Lamarque, is dead - a 4-year-old cracked up two rows of adults by asking aloud the entire audience's unspoken question: ''Who the heck is General Lamarque?''

The strong, pungent stories in ''The Blue Valleys,'' a first collection by the poet Robert Morgan, are set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, whose hills and valleys are a sturdy home for his characters, mostly working people at the mercy of circumstance. As these intricate tales progress chronologically from Civil War times to the present, the dignity of simple farm life is complicated by the advent of computers, working wives and disrespectful children, and the land becomes less a source of livelihood than a vital touchstone. In perhaps the best story in the book, ''Tailgunner,'' a former prisoner of war named Jones realizes that he has spent his life doing things he never wanted to do, married a woman he never intended to marry. Wondering why he alone was spared in the World War II crash of a B-24, he encounters his real self only in the pine woods. ''It was as though he had forgotten something about himself for almost forty years,'' Jones muses. ''He could not explain why the peacefulness of the trees reminded him of instants of great danger and sickness, why he felt close to some bedrock definition, some value.'' Similarly, in the story called ''A Brightness New and Welcoming,'' a soldier dying in the sordidness of a Yankee prison camp during the Civil War thinks about the pristine water of a spring that he had cleared on his home place, and the way the spring ''seemed the dial of some instrument.'' The resilience of childhood, the misery of life in a trailer and the humor of December romance are also among the diverse subjects of the stories in this beautifully crafted collection, a procession of tales rich with native detail and character, told in language as plain and deep as the hills, the whole weighted with an awareness of death that looms over the struggle for a meaningful life.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

The stories of the 14 Chileans interviewed in ''Fear in Chile'' - among them a Communist student, an army colonel, a grandmother who is a diehard supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a yuppie banker - make up a volume of must-reading for would-be dictators. General Pinochet came to power in 1973 - he is to step down after elections on Dec. 14 - and in a country that had never known dictatorship or torture, he buried a 150-year history of democracy and civic culture. Chileans had always thought ''it can't happen here''; Ms. Politzer, one of Chile's best opposition journalists, shows how it did. (The book is superbly translated from the Spanish by Diane Wachtell.) A colonel's tale illustrates how fear of chaos led many to support the coup and blind themselves to the violence that came later. A priest talks about the consumer goods General Pinochet brought to the middle class, and how fear of losing their televisions turned Chileans into the Israelites rebelling against Moses: ''they missed the food they'd had as slaves, and they had no appreciation for freedom and the right of self-government.'' A copper miner speaks of how fear crippled the unions. And there is the hallucinatory terror of the state: a village mayor survives her own execution, a boy is beaten unconscious for wearing long hair, prisoners in the National Stadium fall from the bleachers and ''split open like watermelons'' on the soccer field. Ms. Politzer's sympathies are evident, but all her interviewees get a fair hearing. What emerges is a different Chile from the country of heroic protests seen on the news. These Chileans do heroic deeds, but they also become secret police informers. They cheat on their imprisoned husbands. They let their children go hungry to meet car payments.

us,SOME TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT!,"In the mid-1860's, officers at the United States Naval Academy were disturbed by reports of drinking and carousing by midshipmen. The brass concluded that healthier diversions were needed for the future officers and gentlemen, and football was introduced in 1869. The sport's popularity grew, and in the fall of 1890 Annapolis challenged the United States Military Academy to a game. The West Pointers obliged, and a grand rivalry was born. This rivalry is celebrated in 100 YEARS OF ARMY-NAVY FOOTBALL (Donald Hutter/Holt, $24.95), illustrated with more than 100 black-and-white photographs. Gene Schoor, a sports journalist, chronicles each game of the series, its key plays and such players as Felix (Doc) Blanchard and Glenn Davis, Army's famed ''Mr. Inside, Mr. Outside'' tandem of the 1940's; Pete Dawkins, West Point's All-American halfback in the late 50's; Navy's Joe Bellino, who scored three touchdowns in the 1959 Army-Navy game; and Roger Staubach, the midshipmen's legendary quarterback of the 60's. (Mr. Staubach went on to an outstanding professional career with the Dallas Cowboys.) Reminiscences from notable alumni enhance Mr. Schoor's narrative. The author also recounts the heroism and leadership of former players from the Spanish-American War to Vietnam. The book thus honors not only this national sporting classic but also those whose duty and sacrifices far outweigh any feats on the gridiron.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

Biographies and autobiographies of sports superstars rarely achieve (or are expected to achieve) literary distinction, but even so Larry Bird's ''Drive: The Story of My Life'' is a disappointment. On the basketball court, the Boston Celtic forward is renowned for his flair for the unexpected, but in print, Mr. Bird serves up cliches on the order of ''Every season is a learning experience'' and ''There is no feeling like that championship feeling'' on nearly every page. His predilection for blandness becomes downright bizarre when he is discussing his personal life, especially when he glosses over what must surely have been the most traumatic event of his life - his alcoholic father's suicide when Mr. Bird was 18 years old. Minimizing the event (and its effect on him), Mr. Bird writes ''I know in [ my father's ] mind he thought he was doing something to help the family financially.'' He gives even shorter shrift to his brief, failed, early first marriage and his relationship to a daughter born out of wedlock. From the very beginning of his autobiography, written with Bob Ryan, who covers the Celtics for The Boston Globe, Mr. Bird makes it clear he sees his life in terms of basketball, but offers few insights on the complexities of the professional game. Occasionally, Mr. Bird offers some unexpected nuggets, such as the grudge he's nurtured against Kent Benson ever since the brawny center snubbed him when Bird was an insecure freshman at Indiana University. About the closest Mr. Bird comes to going out on a limb in this book is when he lists reasons why he doesn't like certain professional stadiums. But he still sounds like a summer camper who was forced to write a letter home to his mother.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

In this deceptive novel, adult concerns like power, fame, intimacy and mortality are tackled expertly, as is realistic dialogue laced with the macho accents of two male adolescents. But the writer is neither an experienced author nor a man. Holly Uyemoto, a 19-year-old who lives in northern California, delves into the flashy, sometimes fatal world of easy money, sex and drugs, and emerges with a terrific book. ''Rebel Without a Clue'' is a straightforward tale of the twisted lives of Christian Delon, a thoughtful teen-ager loafing away the summer after his high school graduation and mired in the sludge of the idle rich of Marin County, Calif., and Thomas Bainbridge, his best friend, who at 18 is the ''highest-paid male model in our economically disturbed world,'' a lanky youth with ''wide eyes the color of 7-Up bottles,'' chiseled cheekbones - and AIDS. ''I found myself scrutinizing him closely,'' says Christian, ''afraid he'd disappear right before my eyes. The enormity of the situation hadn't begun to set in but I knew that it meant sooner or later I would only see him in photographs and behind my eyelids. Suddenly I couldn't stop looking at him.'' Christian follows Thomas from brightly lit movie sets to Hollywood soirees attended by characters like a ''balding columnist'' wearing eyeliner and various ''acclaimed talents'' who ''lick mirrors and razors and each other's noses.'' Breaking this destructive cycle, Christian is left with hope for himself but only ambivalence for his dying best friend - a sophisticated ending for an admirable first novel.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

The film director Francis Ford Coppola has grappled with the conflict between art and commerce throughout his career, according to Michael Goodwin, a film journalist, and Naomi Wise, the film critic for San Francisco Focus, in ''On the Edge.'' They present a compelling case, taking the reader through the creation of more than a dozen movies, ranging in commercial appeal from ''The Godfather'' to ''One From The Heart,'' a cold, technological experiment that most filmgoers ignored. The authors' research reveals the director's contrasts: the innovator who demands complete creative control while hoping to find a ''family'' with whom to collaborate; the entrepreneur who negotiates a directing fee of $3 million plus 10 percent of the adjusted gross but later loses his studio, American Zoetrope, to bankruptcy; the emotional wreck who lies on top of a roof during the filming of ''Apocalypse Now,'' letting rain spill over him as he moans, ''Let me out of here.'' The authors' conversational (if occasionally flippant) writing style suits the subject, their anecdotes are engrossing, their observations sound. But since neither Mr. Coppola nor most of his current associates would aid Mr. Goodwin and Ms. Wise, they depend on extensive written material and talks with Mr. Coppola's colleagues from years ago. ''All too often,'' the authors admit, ''we've been forced to rely on accounts we don't entirely trust.''",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

''If destiny assigns us the role of one day being among the last defenders of socialism in a world in which the Yankee empire has succeeded in embodying Hitler's dream of world domination, we will know how to defend this bulwark to the last drop of blood,'' he said. Mr Castro complained of the difficulty of building Communist states when others are tearing them down, and noted the possible consequences of a warming between the United States and the Soviet Union, which sends him so much support.

Through the eyes of Joachim von Elbe one sees the agonizing history of various Germanies: the Imperial Germany of the Kaisers, the turbulent Weimar Republic, the despotic Third Reich, then the Federal Republic, whose fundamental laws the author helped codify. His is an unusual perspective. Born in Westphalia in 1902, bred to assume his place in the administrative ruling elite, he fled Hitler's Reich in 1934 after being classified a ''Mongrel of the Second Degree'' (his grandmother was a niece of the ''non-Aryan'' composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy). What makes ''Witness to History'' valuable is its matter-of-fact decency and its picture-album recall of such episodes as Einstein speaking to students in Hamburg in 1920, Goring ranting in Danzig in 1930, Furtwangler's defiant conducting of Mendelssohn in Berlin in 1934. As a refugee in the United States, Mr. von Elbe studied law at Yale University, became a naturalized citizen, then returned as a G.I. to a devastated Germany. He stayed on as legal adviser to the military government and successive United States ambassadors, finding time to write an authoritative study of Roman Germany. In a lawless century, his story has redemptive value, and his book readably adds to the literature about a divided nation groping to understand where it is heading, what it has been.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

''Don Giovanni,'' set in Harlem, ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' set in Trump Tower, and ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' set in a diner, had been suggested to Austrian Television by its German partners in the venture, Rainer Mockert of Plaza Media and Eberhard Scheele of Mediascope, as provocative supplements to the network's extensive programming plans for the bicentennial of Mozart's death in 1991.",1989-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE TURBAN FOR THE CROWN: The Islamic Revolution in Iran, by Said Amir Arjomand. (Oxford University, $9.95.) A sociologist specializing in Islam tries to explain the mystifying Iranian revolution, in which people rose up to demand less freedom and fewer material things. Last year our reviewer, Robin Wright, called this ''a thought-provoking work and a major contribution to serious scholarship on Iran, modern revolutions and the role of religion in contemporary politics.'' MEMORIES OF AMNESIA, by Lawrence Shainberg. (Ivy, $3.95.) A surgeon suffering from creeping neurological damage becomes convinced that his mind is sabotaging his brain. Last year our reviewer, Diane Johnson, called this novel ''an exercise in paradox, with interesting ruminations on the nature of thought itself. . . . The surrealism of the operating theater reminds one of Kafka's schematized world, pared to its elements of torture and terror - electroencephalographs, optic lobes, oscilloscopes. . . . One also learns a lot about the brain.'' A THIEF OF TIME, by Tony Hillerman. (Harper Paperbacks, $4.95.) A search for a missing anthropologist leads Lieut. Joe Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police to a ring of archeological thieves. The novel ''transcends the conventions of the simple whodunit and plunges the reader into a fully realized world, populated by complex, fascinating characters,'' Michael Dorris said here last year. BALM IN GILEAD: Journey of a Healer, by Sara Lawrence Lightfoot. (Merloyd Lawrence/Addison-Wesley, $9.95.) A Harvard professor tells how her mother, Dr. Margaret Morgan Lawrence, endured years of racism to become a child psychiatrist in New York. ''The wound within is the real subject of 'Balm in Gilead,' although that may not be Sara Lawrence Lightfoot's primary intent,'' H. Jack Geiger said here in January. ''It is a daughter's loving biography.'' THE CARETAKERS, by Bernard Mathias. Translated by Freeman G. Henry. (Penguin, $7.95.) The son of a family of Holocaust survivors is torn between the dark world of the synagogue and the Parisian intellectual life. This novel ''movingly depicts the dilemmas and complexities faced by postwar Jews haunted by the unimaginable,'' Joyce Howe said here last year. GREY IS THE COLOR OF HOPE, by Irina Ratushinskaya. Translated by Alyona Kojevnikov. (Vintage International, $8.95.) A pre-glasnost poet sentenced to prison for ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'' tells how she and her fellow prisoners carved out a psychological space where at least their minds could be free. This memoir has ''an idyllic, exultant tone unprecedented in camp literature,'' Francine du Plessix Gray said here in 1988. SPIRIT OF THE HILLS, by Dan O'Brien. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) In the Black Hills of South Dakota, a Vietnam vet out to revenge his brother's death meets up with the last of the great wolf hunters and a beautiful Sioux political activist. Dan O'Brien ''writes with great confidence, and his story, no matter how twisty or lurid it becomes, is always credible,'' Richard Goodman said in The Book Review last year. THE CLUSTERING OF AMERICA, by Michael J. Weiss. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) More important perhaps than New York, California, Minnesota or Maine are Blue Blood Estates, Money & Brains, Furs & Station Wagons, Bohemian Mix and the other demographic clusters that make up the socioeconomic map of the United States. Earlier this year our reviewer, Roy Blount Jr., said he enjoyed ''lingering over various bits of information [ like ] the clearly demarcated 'mayonnaise line' across the national map, which supposedly 'separates the creamy Hellman's mayonnaise buyers to the South from the tart Kraft Miracle Whip salad dressing lovers to the North.' '' THE MOTHER OF DREAMS. And Other Short Stories: Portrayals of Women in Modern Japanese Fiction. Edited by Makoto Ueda. (Kodansha, $6.95.) To transcend the roles expected of them in Japanese society some of the women in these stories take lovers, others commit suicide.

''The women themselves are quite powerful, whether they are waitresses, secretaries, art dealers, ballerinas or housewives.'' WOMEN OF THE WORLD: The Great Foreign Correspondents, by Julia Edwards. (Ivy, $3.95.) An erstwhile foreign correspondent tells the stories of colleagues like Marguerite Higgins, Martha Gellhorn, Gloria Emerson, Margaret Bourke-White and Mary Roberts Rinehart. Last year our reviewer, Marvine Howe, called this book ''engaging and spirited.'' THE AUTOMOTIVE HISTORY OF LUCKY KELLERMAN, by Steve Heller. (Anchor/Doubleday, $7.95.) A master mechanic hopes to raise the spirits of his disenchanted son by leaving him a 1932 Model 18 Ford Deluxe Roadster. In 1987 our reviewer, Garrett Epps, called this a ''quiet and often beautiful book, [ with ] unspoken moments between father and son [ that ] create an unforgettable image.''

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Mozart: Piano Sonatas (K. 309, 457), Fantasies (K. 396, 397, 475) Cyprien Katsaris, piano. Teldec CD 244 191; CD only. This is not your usual Mozart. Mr. Katsaris makes no attempt to imitate a fortepiano or play a ''Classic'' Mozart. He feels the music Romantically and uses plenty of pedal (without any blurring) and large washes of color. His sound is beautiful, and he can produce a legato that, in Mozart's own words, ''flows like oil.'' The great C minor Fantasy (K. 475) and the last movement of its accompanying C minor Sonata (K. 457) emerge with a great deal of drama. There are some individual ideas about ornamentation. In the C major Sonata (K. 309) the pianist plays the opening appoggiaturas as grace notes, and on the repeat plays them as the appoggiaturas they are, thus straddling both worlds. But Mr. Katsaris has always been an individualist. This French-born Greek pianist is one of the best and most interesting of his generation (between 35 and 45). - Harold C. Schonberg Riley: 'Salome Dances for Peace' Kronos Quartet. Nonesuch 79217; two CD's, LP's and cassettes. The Kronos Quartet can take credit for helping resurrect the compositional career of the founding Minimalist Terry Riley, after his years of immersion in the study of Indian singing. An eight-minute segment of this two-hour score (in a different performance) was included on an earlier Kronos Nonesuch anthology, ''Winter Was Hard.'' The complete work has a curious appeal, though that appeal may not extend to dogged opponents of the California new-music esthetic. The music is simple, innocent, yet, within in its own terms, intelligent and compelling, reaching beyond European modernism to embrace the Orient and universal mystic rituals. - John Rockwell Elgar: 'Enigma Variations,' 'Cockaigne,' Serenade for Strings, 'Salut d'Amour' Baltimore Symphony conducted by David Zinman. Telarc CD-80192; CD only. Compare this release with Leonard Slatkin's recent RCA accounts of the ''Enigma Variations,'' ''Cockaigne'' and the serenade, and Zinman easily emerges as the more sympathetic Elgarian. He understands that ''nobilmente'' doesn't necessarily mean slowly, that Elgar's is the art of the impulsive, the nudge as well as the hesitation. Here's a ''Cockaigne'' by turns jaunty and affectionate, an ''Enigma'' that brings its portraits to life without parodying them, a Serenade and ''Salut d'Amour'' that charm without ever cloying. Apart from an ill-tuned flute in the ''W. N.'' variation of the ''Enigma,'' the Baltimore orchestra plays splendidly, and Telarc supports it with sonics both forward and spacious. - Scott Cantrell Schoenberg: Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16; Webern: Six Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 6; Berg: 'Lulu' Suite Arleen Auger, soprano; City of Birmingham Symphony conducted by Simon Rattle. EMI/Angel CDC 7 49857 2; CD only. Following on the heels of his recent blockbuster recordings of ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''The Rite of Spring,'' Simon Rattle now shows, with his big-boned approach, that he can make Schoenberg just as rhythmically exciting, colorful and thunderous as Stravinsky; that he can jell Webern miniatures into music as expressive as a Mahler movement, and that Berg's final opera contains music as bittersweet as Gershwin's best. Mr. Rattle also, of course, shows off, milking every phrase for the last drop of emotion. But it works. His versions of Schoenberg and Webern may not quite match James Levine's Berlin accounts for beauty and grace. They may lack Pierre Boulez's elegance and point. But they are without equal for pure drama. The Birmingham players know their way around the music, and Arleen Auger sings the ''Lulu'' excerpts with smooth confidence. The sonics are epic. - Mark Swed Debussy, Janacek, R. Strauss: Sonatas for Violin and Piano Dmitry Sitkovetsky, violin; Pavel Gililov, piano. Virgin Classics VC 7 90760; CD and cassette. To hear this glorious account of the Strauss Sonata (1887) is to wonder that the piece is so rarely heard in the concert hall. It's a young man's grandiloquence and ardor, dreaminess and playfulness, but a rich musical culture shines through it. Mr. Sitkovetsky plays radiantly, and his subtly shaded vibrato is welcome relief in these throb-besotted times; Mr. Gililov is a marvelously responsive, characterful collaborator. They're no less responsive to the mercurial twists and turns of the Janacek, a piece that while written (and twice revised) in the composer's 60's, burns with hardly less fire. Only the Debussy disappoints: The slinky, sultry first movement proves all too straight, and what follows falls just short of ''fantasque et leger.'' Sonics are lively, but some will find the piano sound a little too cavernous. - S. C. POP/JAZZ Phil Collins: '. . . But Seriously' Atlantic 82050; all three formats. Among pop music's top stars, Mr. Collins comes the closest to embodying the ideal of the solid citizen. His solo albums blend pop straightforwardness with echoes of English art rock and post-Motown pop-soul into a comfortably accessible mainstream sound that is distinctive, if at times a bit plodding. As its title suggests, ''. . . But Seriously'' is a soberer album than usual. Its four socially conscious songs reflect on homelessness, South African injustice, urban racial unrest and the troubles in Northern Ireland. Mr. Collins's sympathetic reflections are bluntly phrased but also so broad in their perspective that they sound more official than personal in tone. ''Colors,'' the most ambitious song, is a two-movement suite that ends with a denunciation of the South African Government. - Stephen Holden The Tragically Hip: 'Up to Here' MCA 6310; all three formats. Straightforward, bluesy rock - the Rolling Stones via John Cougar Mellencamp - isn't obsolete. The Tragically Hip, from Toronto, charge up the old forms with deep-seated, homey eccentricity. Wiry, catchy, down-to-earth guitar lines and a decisive beat hold the songs together, as the lyrics sidle from oddball stories to free associations on the edge of coherence; the taut drama of ''When the Weight Comes Down,'' for instance, might or might not be about a custody battle. And Gordon Downie sings in a haggard, quavery, tenacious voice that bends melodies downward and around, then growls with defiance. The Tragically Hip are tragically misnamed; they sound sweaty, not trendy. - Jon Pareles Roxanne Shante: 'Bad Sister' Cold Chillin'/Reprise 925809; all three formats. In the title track of her debut album, Roxanne Shante hears that a group of female rappers are in town to challenge her status as the Queen of Rap. The story masks a history lesson: Ms. Shante's 1984 single, ''Roxanne's Revenge,'' predated M. C. Lyte, Queen Latifah and other Jenny-come-latelys. In a curt, almost cynical voice, over spare, rugged beats by Marley Marl, the producer, Ms. Shante's 10 new raps - from the slinky put-down, ''Knockin' Hiney'' to the how-to advice of ''Independent Woman'' - combine humor and raw rhythmic power with Ms. Shante's sturdy sense of identity. The long-awaited ''Bad Sister'' proves she's tougher and wittier than the competition. - Karen Schoemer Gipsy Kings: 'Mosaique' Elektra Musician 9 60892; all three formats. ''Mosaique'' demonstrates how fine the line is between enhancement and sterilization when a producer attempts to contemporize a traditional musical style. In producing last year's ''Gipsy Kings,'' Claude Martinez sparingly added modern touches to flamenco-descended music by the southern French gypsy ensemble and came up with something fresh and exciting. On ''Mosaique,'' the thicker, often kitschy arrangements, which bring in strings, piano, trumpet, oboe, electric guitar and more elaborate synthesizer and percussion, subvert the passion that is the Gipsy Kings' greatest strength. One of the high points of last year's album was a fiery remake of ''My Way.'' One of the low points on ''Mosaique'' is a stiff, mechanical ''Volare.'' - S. H. The Grateful Dead: 'Built to Last' Arista 8575; all three formats. In the wake of their first Top 10 hit, the Grateful Dead have faltered. As on the 1987 album ''In the Dark,'' songs proffer reassurance and apocalypse; although ''Built to Last'' is more elaborately produced than many Dead albums, most of the music sounds labored yet thin. Brent Mydland, on keyboards, has emerged as a songwriter and husky-voiced singer, with the attempted ecology anthem ''We Can Run'' and conventional, pop-oriented love songs; ''I Will Take You Home'' is accompanied only by keyboards. And songs by the Dead's two longtime guitarists and singers, Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia, are plodding and scattered. But if anyone can resuscitate them in concert, the Dead will. - J.

us,Talking Business with Cooper of Trimedyne; Laser Technology To Treat Disease,"Lasers now constitute a $700 million market that analysts expect to grow into the billions. Howard K. Cooper, president and chief executive of Trimedyne Inc., a Tustin, Calif., company that was a pioneer in the development of laser technology in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, recently discussed the outlook for medical uses of the laser, an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. By diagnostic category, cardiovascular disease is the single most costly ailment in the United States, accounting for $85 billion a year, or 15 percent of the total amount spent by Americans on health care. Q. What is spurring the growing use of lasers? A. First, it is important to understand that a laser produces a high-intensity beam of light that can perform a host of functions, including bar-code scanning in supermarkets, etching of surface-mount semiconductors in electronics manufacturing and lighting for multimedia entertainment. The sheer diversity of the market is contributing to the rapid growth. As an alternative to surgery, laser procedures typically offer safer and less invasive treatments, which translate into shorter hospital stays and, in many cases, the avoidance of surgery. Q. How are lasers used to treat disease? A. Let's use a specific example to illustrate the technique. Without lasers, a patient with atherosclerosis, a degenerative vascular disease that narrows arteries in the heart, brain, legs and other parts of the body, might be treated by bypass surgery. In more severe cases, amputation might be the only alternative. In laser treatment, a fiber-optic probe is inserted into an artery through a small puncture in the arm or leg. The probe is steered through the cardiovascular system to the blockage formed by thickened fatty deposits, commonly referred to as plaque, which blocks the blood flow. To vaporize the plaque, the probe is heated by a steady flow of energy from the laser system. Q. How does the cost of laser treatment compare with standard surgery? A. Typically, laser treatment is substantially less expensive. The average cost of treating a blocked leg artery with a laser is $7,000, while major surgery would cost an average of $27,000. Q. How successful is the laser treatment? A. Lately, this has become a major point of debate within the medical community. In my opinion, the decision on whether or not to use a laser should be made on a case-by-case basis. Since 1987, about 30,000 cardiovascular disease cases have been successfully treated with laser technology, and many patients were spared major surgery. Each month, another 1,000 to 1,500 new cases are treated. In general, success depends upon several factors, including the severity of the patient's blockage. Q. What is the risk in laser treatment compared with invasive procedures? A. There is nothing to indicate that the complications experienced in laser treatment are any worse than those that might be encountered through the use of balloon angioplasty. Q. Are there different types of lasers? A. Yes. In treating cardiovascular disease, the most widely used is the hot-tip laser - a vaporizer of plaque through a steady flow of energy - which was first approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Adminstration in 1987. There are other laser systems in varying developmental stages, including the cold- and cool-tip lasers that release energy impulses to achieve the same objective. Q. Can any of these lasers be used to unclog plaque in the heart arteries? A. Separate clinical trials using either the hot- or cold-tip laser in coronary cases are currently under way. Given the unique structure of the heart arteries, smaller laser probes are used in coronary arteries. The first F.D.A. approval of lasers for coronary cases could occur in 1990. Q. Looking out to 1995, how big will the total market for lasers be and what share will medical applications have? A. Five years can be an eternity for any technology, so it is really impossible to say. As laser technology continues to be refined, however, I think many more applications will be discovered. In the health and medical area, you will see a greater embracement of laser-based procedures, particularly among physicians and hospital adminstrators. As with any new approach, there is a tendency to resist change, and yet change is inevitable.",1989-12-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: Steak,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current. Amsterdam's Bar and Rotisserie * (March 3, 1989), 428 Amsterdam Avenue, at 80th Street (874-1377) -Amsterdam's strategy for success combines a menu of simple rotisserie dishes, down-to-earth prices and an informal setting. The restaurant is frenzied at times, and the most agreeable place is the elevated back dining room. One of the best dinner entrees is roasted shell steak, which comes out of the rotisserie nicely seared and is served with a red-wine-peppercorn sauce. French fries are clean and crisp, as are the roasted new potatoes. The wine list has 20 well-chosen selections. At dinner, appetizers are $3.50 to $6.95, entrees $9.95 to $15.95. Open noon to midnight Sunday to Thursday, until 1 A.M. Friday and Saturday. De l'Alsace a Brandywine Diner's Journal (June 2, 1989), 274 Third Avenue, near 21st Street (353- 8190) - Serious beef-lovers can find hefty porterhouse and T-bone steaks here. A steakhouse with a French accent, this cozy Gramercy Park restaurant has hired the Alsace-born chef of the four-star Lafayette as consultant. A recommended dish is steak a la stone, a sliced sirloin with sauteed peppers, onions and mushrooms. Home fries or mashed potatoes make a good side dish. Appetizers are $7 to $10, entrees $16 to $22. Lunch is 11:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Monday to Saturday. Le Steak Diner's Journal (Dec. 23, 1988), 1089 Second Avenue, near 58th Street (421-9072) - Le Steak, a Second Avenue fixture for 25 years and still going strong, is popular for its reasonable three-course dinners. The dark Tudor-style bistro serves a full-flavored sirloin with thin, light french fries for $21.95; the price includes cheesy onion soup or romaine and escarole salad in a well-balanced vinaigrette, dessert (the fine creme caramel is the best option) and coffee. Open 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. daily. The Post House ** (Aug. 26, 1988), 28 East 63d Street (935-2888) - The Post House, with its urbane ambiance and clientele, is expensive, but the quality of the steaks is excellent. Among recommended offerings is the aged rib steak with a well-seasoned crust; the same huge cut is available Cajun style with a moderately peppery coating. Most seafood is equally compelling. Recommended appetizers includeplump crab cakes, sauteed shrimp and cedar-planked salmon. The Post House has a broad and provocative wine list that includes some vintages from small producers in New York State. At lunch, appetizers are $8 to $12.50, entrees $16 to $29; at dinner, appetizers are $9.50 to $13.50, entrees $20.50 to $29.75. Open noon to 11 P.M. Monday to Friday, 5:30 P.M. to midnight Saturday, until 11 P.M. Sunday. Sparks Steakhouse ** (Oct 27, 1989), 210 East 46th Street (687-4855) - Sparks is a bustling, diet-be-damned kind of restaurant that serves the best steaks in town. It also features a superior wine list strong in California cabernet sauvignons and red Bordeaux. Among beef entrees, the choices include a tender and unadorned prime sirloin with a salt-edged crust, and an excellent filet mignon. The menu also carries an adequate selection of fish. Split and broiled lobsters are a delight here. Crusty hash browns make the best side dish. Appetizers are $4.95 to $13.50, entrees $19.95 to $29.95. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner: 5 to 11 P.M. Monday to Thursday, until 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. What the stars mean, page C32.",1989-12-15T05:00:00+0000

Japanese interiors may be the picture of stark and perfect order, but step out into a Japanese city and chaos takes over. Streets zigzag; buildings of all shapes and sizes are jumbled together like someone's closet full of toys. Neither center nor grid anchor Tokyo or check its growth; the city has over the centuries sprouted like a patch of weeds, overcoming fires and other setbacks to adapt easily to industrialization and the information era. In ''The Hidden Order,'' the architect Yoshinobu Ashihara educes the logic behind the apparent confusion. Architects in Japan think from the inside out, he writes; they start inside the traditional house, and they start with the floor. People move through their homes shoeless and crouching; their line of vision is about a foot lower than in Western houses. With a perspective angled so insistently downwards and lengthwise, walls seem an afterthought, rice-paper interruptions that slide open to the touch. The line between private and public is blurry: the intimacy of the Japanese home, and its lack of space, force people out of the house for social contact and turn public places into living rooms, kitchens and studies. The Japanese city sprawls outward with the same centrifugal force, defying blueprints but quick to respond to changing human and technological needs. Mr. Ashihara draws upon an impressive knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, esthetics and religion to illustrate his points. Unfortunately, the translation from the Japanese by Lynne E. Riggs is awkward, so much so that in some places it is hard to tell whether Mr. Ashihara means to praise or criticize, when he is describing the way things are and when he is prescribing change.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

When a University of London professor named Susan Barnes decides to visit her cousin Joanna in Los Angeles, she brings along the notes for her half-finished introduction to a new edition of ''Emma'' and a complete set of prejudices regarding the vapidity of the Hollywood film industry, the California beach culture and the United States in general. Upon her arrival, she finds herself surrounded by a ''circle of impregnably smiling faces,'' which are attached to people who say insipid things like, ''God, I would kill for a British accent!'' As these clues might indicate, Gabrielle Donnelly's second book, ''Faulty Ground,'' is a modern-day novel of manners in the tradition of Jane Austen. However, instead of a Regency drawing room, the action revolves around a California kitchen, equipped with a stream of walk-in visitors and a constantly ringing telephone. The refrigerator is stocked with an abundant supply of white wine, and the plot is laden with an intricate series of friendly alliances and romantic dalliances, as characters pair off and re-pair off in something of a West Coast square dance. With a fine ear for the rhythms of colloquial speech, Ms. Donnelly neatly sketches the contrasts between the deft, rapier wit of the British and the blunt, straight-ahead style of their American counterparts. Warming to the local demeanor, Susan gradually revises her stereotypically European view of the New World as a land without history or social graces. Illusion, she finds, is the metier not only of Hollywood but also of those who live in the shadow of the movie industry. As Susan contemplates her new emotional and geographical terrain, she begins to sense the violent forces that churn beneath its pleasant exteriors. By the novel's end, she is faced with a moral choice of classical proportions, proof that the dark stuff of tragedy flows just below the surface in even the sunniest of climes.

Finance - and financial fraud - can be dry and arcane. But in ''The Big Fix,'' James Ring Adams offers a front-row seat at a three-ring circus. Mr. Adams presents the downfall of some high-flying financial empires, including the Butcher brothers' Tennessee banking system and Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. He also chronicles the bumbling efforts of financial regulators, who seemed unable to rein in banks and savings and loan associations when their examiners found problems. And Mr. Adams shows members of Congress - from former House Speaker Jim Wright to Senators Donald Riegle and Alan Cranston - juggling political contributions with one hand while using the other to interrupt the regulatory process. But Mr. Adams, a financial journalist, means to do more than tell tales. He argues persuasively that the system of Government insurance for bank and thrift deposits - instituted after the banking crises of the 1930's - was ''a deeply flawed notion,'' bound to go haywire. Such guarantees, he explains, allow financial institutions to keep attracting funds even as they make risky investments and lose money; depositors do not care because they know that the Government will reimburse them even if a bank or a savings and loan institution closes. Now that Americans are faced with a bill estimated at more than $150 billion to make good on the deposits of failed savings and loan associations, Mr. Adams should find a ready audience.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

The ascension of the United States as a world power, according to John Taft, was largely due to the efforts of a Northeastern, Ivy League-educated, internationalist elite. This group, including George Kennan, Averell Harriman and Dean Acheson, believed that world order could be created through the Wilsonian ideals of free trade, democracy, anti-imperialism and world organizations. After World War II, Mr. Taft writes in ''American Power,'' they supported the containment of Communism, the Korean War and the cold war in general. They served in the foreign-policy establishment for 50 years and shaped the political, economic and military underpinnings of United States diplomacy. Mr. Taft maintains that this policy was dealt a severe blow when the United States tried to extend its power and influence into the third world in the 1950's and 60's. The frustrations and failures that culminated in the Vietnam debacle caused the internationalist liberals to question former policies and led to what Mr. Taft terms ''isolationist liberalism.'' This loss of resolve resulted in a major loss of United States power in the world. Mr. Taft has done a fine job, but tells only part of the story. He glosses over the role certain business interests played in United States involvement in different parts of the world. He also gives little credit to the McCarthyite red scare that led, in the name of anti-Communism, to the support of corrupt regimes such as Ngo Dinh Diem's in South Vietnam. To Mr. Taft, the author of ''Mayday at Yale,'' post-Vietnam foreign policy is liberal isolationism. To others, it is a reasonable reaction to a world that can no longer be ordered by American and European elites.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"UTZ, by Bruce Chatwin. (Penguin, $7.95.) A petty aristocrat named Kaspar Joachim Utz becomes trapped in Czechoslovakia by the priceless collection of porcelain that he refuses to leave behind. The last novel of Bruce Chatwin, who died earlier this year, shows him ''at his most erudite and evocative,'' Robert Stone said here in January. '' 'Utz' provides its readers with a rich and rewarding meditation.'' THE MASTER OF THE GAME: Paul Nitze and the Nuclear Peace, by Strobe Talbott. (Vintage, $10.95.) In the third installment of his chronicles of arms control, Strobe Talbott tells how the ever-practical negotiator Paul Nitze turned Ronald Reagan's utopian Star Wars plan into a bargaining chip. Mr. Talbott ''demonstrates his own mastery of bureaucratic drama, combining a gift for characterization and an eye for the revealing anecdote with a firm grasp of his subject,'' Lawrence Freedman said in The Book Review in 1988. ''His sources are enviable, allowing him to offer an instant history that rings true throughout.'' CAT'S EYE, by Margaret Atwood. (Bantam, $5.95.) An artist goes home to Toronto for a retrospective of her paintings and finds herself haunted by memories of a disturbed childhood friend. ''All this is vintage Atwood,'' our reviewer, Alice McDermott, said in February: ''the precise and devastating detail, the sense of the ordinary transformed into nightmare, the quiet desperation of characters trapped, silenced, utterly alone.'' DESPERADOS: Latin Drug Lords, U.S. Lawmen, and the War America Can't Win, by Elaine Shannon. (Penguin, $4.95.) A reporter for Time magazine tells why she thinks economic and diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States interfered with the investigation into the death of Enrique Camarena, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was murdered in Guadalajara. This ''well-reported reconstruction of the investigation'' raises ''disturbing questions,'' Jeff Gerth said here last year. THE FIFTH STATION, by Kevin McIlvoy. (Collier/Macmillan, $6.95.) When their brother is killed in a mill accident, two steelworkers move to New Mexico and try to forget. Last year our reviewer, Patricia Dobler, said this first novel is ''rich with details of both mill life and life in a rural New Mexican community.'' TOCQUEVILLE: A Biography, by Andre Jardin. Translated by Lydia Davis with Robert Hemenway. (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.95.) This biography of the visitor who explained the American mind to both the French and the Americans is ''written with admirable thoroughness,'' Joan Wallach Scott said here in February. THE VEILED ONE, by Ruth Rendell. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Like a patient with his psychiatrist, the suspect in a parking-garage murder develops a fixation on his interrogator. Last year our reviewer, Josh Rubins, said Ruth Rendell's ''uncompromising psychological suspense novels . . . offer harrowing, coolly ironic excursions into the minds of genteel psychopaths and secret sex offenders, the lonely and obsessed and deluded. . . . [ Her ] prose - lean, sly, almost clinical - reinforces the bleakness.'' THE SIGNIFYING MONKEY: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism, by Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Oxford University, $10.95.) Looking to both ancient African myths and contemporary literary theory, a scholar develops a new theory of black literature. ''This somewhat intimidating, quite serious essay in literary criticism can be enjoyed by a variety of readers,'' John Wideman said in The Book Review last year. Oxford has also reissued Mr. Gates's 1987 book, FIGURES IN BLACK: WORDS, SIGNS, AND THE ''RACIAL'' SELF ($10.95), in which he applies the ideas of modern critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida to the works of Ishmael Reed, Alice Walker and other black writers. Howard University Press has republished BLACK IS THE COLOR OF THE COSMOS: Essays on Afro-American Literature and Culture, 1942-1981 ($15.95). The pieces, written by Charles T. Davis and edited by Mr. Gates, analyze such authors as Jean Toomer, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. WAVERLY PLACE, by Susan Brownmiller. (Signet/New American Library, $4.95.) In a fictionalized account of the Joel Steinberg-Hedda Nussbaum case, Susan Brownmiller tries to fathom how a couple in her Greenwich Village neighborhood dug themselves into a sadomasochistic life that led to the killing of a 6-year-old girl. Last year The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said that, while the book is not satisfying as a novel, it ''serves a potentially constructive purpose. It tries to fill the emotional void created by any incomprehensible human act. It proposes how such a thing could have happened and allows us to participate in the drama of its answer.'' ALICIA: My Story, by Alicia Appleman-Jurman. (Bantam, $4.95.) After losing her family, a teen-age girl helps her fellow Poles escape the Nazis. This autobiography is ''so profoundly observed, and the life it records so remarkably lived, that no amount of prior immersion in the sad community of witnesses to the Holocaust can dull the reader to its heroine,'' Sonia Taitz said in The Book Review last year. KOKO, by Peter Straub. (Signet/New American Library, $5.95.) Three Vietnam veterans suspect that a member of their old platoon is the infamous Koko, a serial killer in Southeast Asia who leaves a playing card with a picture of an elephant in his victims' mouths.

us,FICTION,"RUNNING WILD. By J. G. Ballard. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.95.) Over the last 25 years, the British writer J. G. Ballard has touched a great many stylistic bases, ranging from straight science fiction (''The Drowned World'') to abrasive experimentalism (''Crash'') to autobiographical realism (''Empire of the Sun''). But regardless of genre, Mr. Ballard's books have tended to share certain qualities, including a fascination with electronic media, a taste for black-comic paradox and, most of all, an ability to immerse the reader in different fictional worlds. ''Running Wild,'' which is presented as the forensic diaries of Dr. Richard Greville, a psychiatric adviser to the London police, certainly bears the first two of these trademarks. Greville has been asked to investigate the Pangbourne Massacre, a mysterious tragedy in which the 32 adult residents of an exclusive community 30 miles west of London have been murdered, and their 13 children apparently abducted. Who could have carried out such an atrocity? And why? Greville lists the various theories put forth by the authorities, in order of escalating absurdity. He watches hours of videotaped evidence and ponders the community's way of life, one in which ''scarcely a minute of the children's lives had not been intelligently planned.'' Slowly - more slowly, in any case, than most readers - he comes to the conclusion that the assassins were the children themselves. The Pangbourne offspring, he concludes, ''were rebelling against . . . a despotism of kindness. They killed to free themselves from a tyranny of love and care.'' Really? The assumptions ''Running Wild'' is supposed to challenge, such as the fairy-tale version of family happiness, haven't been widely accepted for decades. Nor has Mr. Ballard given himself ample space to compensate for his warmed-over concept: the novel's 104 pages immerse us no deeper than the ankles. ''Running Wild'' has its pleasures, but it's J. G. Ballard at his scantiest, his most reduced. What he gives us here is a dream communicated in Morse code.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

The startling thing, though, is how well Hope Ryden's study of a beaver family succeeds on other levels. Her observations of a pair of wild beavers in New York's Harriman State Park is eloquent and suspenseful, educational without being didactic, and includes a reasoned analysis of whether humans should further disrupt nature's balance. ''I don't believe in feeding wildlife,'' writes Ms. Ryden, ''but like most people I don't always abide by my own principles.'' She abandons those principles when certain that the family she possessively calls ''my beavers'' will starve to death and feels vindicated later when the pair becomes self-sufficient. The author, however, is usually a silent observer of her beavers. Ms. Ryden, whose previous books include ''Bobcat Year'' and ''God's Dog,'' both observes and explains the extremely sophisticated behavior of the animals, noting that the beaver is not truly a nocturnal animal but developed its nighttime habits in reaction to humans. Beavers are probably best known for their engineering, and here too she observes and argues that much of the animals' behavior seems ''too complex to be casually dismissed with the simplistic word 'instinct.' '' The animals are fascinating and likable, as is the story of their life.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Episodic, concise and poetic, this unconventional tale about social misfits and secret desires feels dreamlike in its quick passage and sometimes indelible imagery. Dispensing with plot, Ms. Levy has organized an exploration of the mind's dark regions that employs as her dreamer an odd, mystically inclined woman known only as Lapinski. Lapinski's voice, with its sleepwalker's rhythms, is the center around which a handful of characters - the beautiful mutants - orbit. Indeed, she is hardly more than a voice. We learn little about her except that she's a Russian exile in London who works in a meat-packing factory. Her lovers and acquaintances, who come to us filtered through her dreamscape, are a ragged, if not disturbed, bunch. There's a weary poet whose oracular pronouncements (''It is difficult to make a map in splintered times when whole worlds and histories collide'') seem trite; an anarchist who raids the zoo and communes with a llama; a jaded, masochistic banker; and a prostitute. Each character flutters briefly for several pages, long enough to skim the lower depths and retrieve the sort of sexually overripe and violent images that were the French poet and dramatist Antonin Artaud's stock in trade and are now the novelist Kathy Acker's. These scenes are either luridly visceral or earnestly poetic, but in the end they fail to cohere. The concoction of a successful dream narrative requires the inclusion of just enough of the mundane so that macabre visions can register against it. While ''Beautiful Mutants'' provides some choice moments, too often they are submerged by Ms. Levy's penchant for excess.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

(Berg's second opera, ''Lulu,'' is the only other remote contender.) It was first heard in 1925 and had almost 30 productions by the early 30's. After a hiatus while Nazi disapproval halted its progress before German-speaking audiences, it resumed its place at home and spread to all the world's operatic capitals. At a time when atonality is increasingly seen as a failed project, the work shows no sign of loosening its hold - though the rows of empty seats traditional at its Metropolitan Opera revivals testify to a continuing failure of communication between this score and some part of the mainstream opera audience. This is understandable, but probably remediable: there are aspects of the score that may still be drowned out by its reputation. ''Wozzeck'' returns to the Met Thursday evening, with a cast including Hildegard Behrens and Gottfried Hornik.

us,Remarks to Reporters By Bush and Mitterrand,"Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand of France today in St. Martin, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription company: Q. . . . I understand that one area of disagreement between the both of you was on the subject of export controls on highly sensitive goods shipped into Eastern Europe, the so-called Cocom regulations. President Bush, I wonder if at this point, since you're making overtures in other areas, you feel it's time to relax these regulations? And also if President Mitterrand would respond, too, if you and the United States are in more agreement today on this than you were before the meeting? BUSH: One, I did not have a discussion with the President of France on that subject. Two, we should and will review our Cocom - our participation in Cocom, our discussions in Cocom. There are certainly still legitimate national security interests that must be preserved, and I don't think we have one iota of difference with France on that. But I think it is timely that we take a new look at some of the commercial constraints. Q: On East Germany, do you have any specific prescriptions to keep the situation from running wild? Apparently it's quite different from what was going on in Poland and Hungary. Mr. President, perhaps some instant food aid as winter approaches? Is there some special way to treat the East German chaotic situation? BUSH: I don't know there's a special way, but we spelled out at NATO the four points that relate to German reunification - the Strasbourg declaration under the meeting headed by President Mitterrand addressed themselves to that question. Obviously, if there's emergency food aid required there - we have no request for that - but if it's required, we would be very responsive, as I expect others in the alliance would be. Q. President Mitterrand, I'd like to ask you if you discussed in any way China, and what you think of President Bush's decision to send his envoys to China recently? And if I could follow on that, Mr. Bush, if perhaps you've had second thoughts about the nature in which this was done, in the secretive fashion, and in the toasting of the Chinese while your envoys were there? MITTERRAND: Thank you for this question. Well, I should have said in my presentation, indeed we did talk about China, and this was at the initiative of President Bush, who himself expressed the wish of being able to give us his views on this subject and the reason for what was done. So, I think now you might hear this. BUSH: I have no second thoughts at all. And being somewhat familiar with China, I've learned that you listen to everything that's said in a toast. We've looked at every word and analyzed it, and I'm strongly supportive of this mission by General Scowcroft and Larry Eagleburger. I've said that I initiated it and I'm not going to go further, except to say that I hope that it will have positive results. Q.Is there any agreement between France and the U.S. to slow down Mr. Kohl in his drive toward reunification? MITTERRAND: I have your answer. Is there an agreement or conformity of view to slow down? Yes, there's a great conformity of views -particularly to slow down the - as to - considering slowing down Mr. Kohl, that's a specific matter. But we think that everything as was said in Strasbourg is to be done in the respect of treaties and the principles of Helsinki. Q. Mr. President, my question is addressed to you on Lebanon. If General Aoun refuses to leave, do you approve of a military operation against him, and did you discuss this situation with President Mitterrand? BUSH: We did discuss the Lebanese situation. Both of us want to see a bloodbath avoided there. It is the position of the United States that Mr. Hrawi is the head of government there and recognized as such and that, in our view, things would be much benefited if Mr. Aoun left. . . .",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

On and off for 11 years - beginning in college in the late 60's -Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) ostensibly debate whether men and women can be nonsexual friends. But that issue instantly evaporates and the question becomes: When will they realize they were made for each other? ''What Harry and Sally do in the meantime - the true focus of this often funny but amazingly hollow film - is saunter through the romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers.'' Rob Reiner has made ''the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of deja vu.'' (Caryn James) Star Trek V: The Final Frontier 1989. Paramount. No listed price. LD. $29.95. 1:47. CC. PG. An aberrant, emotional Vulcan with a holy man's long white robe and a crazed zealot's gleam in his eyes (Laurence Luckinbill) is determined to take over the Starship Enterprise and lead it through a new frontier to enter an Edenic place where God awaits. Because the actors (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley) ''are tireless and sincere in their roles,'' the film ''has its appealing moments'' and the director, Mr. Shatner, keeps it ''just this side of camp. . . . But true fans may be disappointed that the film's profuse plot waters down its familiar texture.'' (James) Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown 1988. Orion. $79.98. LD. $39.95. 1:38. R. Pepa's longtime lover, a male chauvinist rat, walks out on her, leaving only a bland message on her answering machine. Planning suicide, Pepa (Carmen Maura) spikes a blenderful of garden-fresh gazpacho with sleeping pills, but forgets to drink it. Her best friend, who has been having a blissful affair with a man she didn't realize was a Shiite terrorist, comes by looking for refuge from the police. ''These are only some of the delirious ingredients in this most entertaining, deliberately benign Spanish farce.'' Pedro Almodovar's film ''has much of the cheeringly mad intensity of animated shorts produced in Hollywood before the television era.'' (Vincent Canby) Renegades 1989. MCA. $89.95. LD. $34.98. 1:45. CC. R. Kiefer Sutherland plays a Philadelphia cop who infiltrates a high-powered gang of criminals to expose the dishonest policeman they've bought off. During the gang's escape from a jewel robbery, they kill Lou Diamond Phillips's brother and tear off with a lance that is sacred to the Lakota Sioux tribe. Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Phillips team up to find the killer and retrieve the lance. ''It is a fast, violent, implausible film about mismatched partners, and though it doesn't exactly break the bounds of its trashy genre, it's not at all bad for what it is.'' (James) Lock Up 1989.

While few of us really knew the Santa Fe Super Chief or ever rode the 20th Century Limited, the mere whisper of such names evokes excitement and romance, in the same way we are still stirred by the sound of a faraway locomotive whistle. In our fantasies, trains are travel, not merely transportation. So when the American-European Express began operating last month between Chicago and Washington - four vintage rail coaches rebuilt by hand and coupled to the rear of Amtrak's regularly scheduled Capitol Limited - it generated not only curiosity but also high expectations. With fares at $1,042 for two people sharing a compartment, more than twice the cost of Amtrak's most expensive berth, travelers are not merely buying passage; they are buying a ticket aboard a rolling stage set, a kind of living fantasy of first-class railroad travel, surrounded by leather and Honduran mahogany, china and Belgian damask and attended by a cast of waiters, trainmen and porters in full costume, right down to their epaulets and royal blue shoulder capes.",1989-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Fecher, the editor of the diary, tells us, deeply, romantically in love with his wife, Sara. It's ironic that Mencken began his diary in the first year of a new decade. The one that had just ended had been his in a very real sense. During the 1920's, he had established himself as the most powerful and original force in American literary criticism, a force that might be admired or detested but could not possibly be ignored. In the 30's, his popularity would decline sharply, his influence diminish, his career founder. His beloved Sara would die, leaving a terrible void.

A panel of antiquities experts in Egypt recently concluded that a 700-pound chunk that fell from the shoulder of the Sphinx last year was dislodged by natural forces - wind, rain and salt. But then along came Larry Hunter, an otherwise unidentified American. Mr. Hunter recently presented authorities in Cairo with a videotape of the confession of a guard who said he saw two antiquities officials hammering at the Sphinx's shoulder before the chunk was dislodged. Ridiculous, said one expert after another, including the two who were accused. Some suggested that the whole incident had more to do with old enmities between experts. It seems that Ahmed Khari, who was in charge of restoring the Sphinx until he was fired after the shoulder separation, has had profound personal differences with Farouk Hosni, the Minister of Culture, whose portfolio includes Egypt's antiquities. The unspoken implication seemed to be that if the guard's confession was true, Mr. Khari was fired unjustly.

For the last three months, ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' with Peter Jennings, has either led the three-man pack in ratings or, at worst, tied with the ''CBS Evening News,'' anchored by Dan Rather. ''NBC Nightly News'' is third and last.

Since the advent of the 16-game regular-season schedule in the National Football League, what is the worst record in each conference for a team that made the playoffs? What is the best record in each conference over the same span for a team that failed to make the playoffs? A. Excluding this season and the strike-curtailed seasons of 1982 and 1987, there have been 9 full years of the 16-game schedule. In the National Football Conference, no team has ever made the playoffs in that time with a winning percentage of .500 or less. The poorest mark to qualify was the 8-7-1 record stitched together by the Minnesota Vikings in 1978, the first year of the expanded schedule. That record not only proved good enough to reach the post-season, it also earned the Vikings the Central Division championship. The Green Bay Packers also finished at 8-7-1, but Minnesota won the top spot because it had the better record in the two meetings of the teams. In the playoffs, though, sanity prevailed, and the Vikings lasted only one game, a 34-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.",1989-12-18T05:00:00+0000

There are exceptions, said Dr. Webster, who specializes in Maya archeology in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. ''For example, in Mexico City, the Aztecs built temples on a lake bed, where they did sink,'' he said. ''Modern buildings sink there for the same reason. But in the Maya area, the buildings on bed rock are right there where they always were.''",1989-12-19T05:00:00+0000

Jordan had 20 points in the fourth quarter, but Orlando rallied from five deficits in the final 4 minutes 49 seconds to win its sixth game over a 1989 playoff team and fourth over a division leader this season. Orlando's 9-15 record is the best start after 24 games in National Basketball Association expansion history. Other Orlando victories over division leaders include the Knicks, the Los Angeles Lakers and Utah. With Chicago leading, 109-108, Smith got the ball at the top of the key with four seconds left, drove between Jordan and Scottie Pippen and layed the ball in. Jordan, who was 20 for 37 from the field and converted his 10 free-throw attempts, tried a desperation shot from 30 feet, but Smith and Nick Anderson both got a hand on the ball. The bench, led by Smith, gave the Magic a big boost in the first half, scoring 31 points. Jordan, who scored 54 points in overtime earlier this year against Cleveland, has 19 50-point games in his career.(AP) San Antonio 103, Sacramento 100: David Robinson scored 26 points and made three free throws in the final 27 seconds as San Antonio won its 10th consecutive home game. The Spurs, 11-1 in San Antonio this season, also guaranteed having their second consecutive winning month, a feat the team had not accomplished in four years. San Antonio, 8-5 in November, is 7-1 in December with five games remaining. The score was tied at 98-98 with 27 seconds to play when Robinson hit two foul shots. After Harold Pressley missed a 20-footer, Vernon Maxwell added two more free throws, giving the Spurs a 102-98 lead with 3.4 seconds left. Waymon Tisdale's short jumper got the Kings within 2, but Robinson hit a foul shot with 1.1 seconds left, giving the Spurs their margin of victory. (AP) Nuggets 104, Cavaliers 89: Walter Davis scored 8 points during an 11-0 run in the first quarter, then hit an 18-footer to cap a 16-4 spurt in the second quarter for the visiting Nuggets. Cleveland had its four-game winning streak snapped as the Cavaliers suffered their first loss since Larry Nance returned from ankle surgery. They were 6-11 before Nance came back. Denver took control early, going ahead by 12-2 as Cleveland made one field goal in the first 5:30. Blair Rasmussen of Denver grabbed 11 of his 16 rebounds in the first quarter, and the Nuggets outrebounded Cleveland, 57-38, for the game.(AP) 76ers 118, Bullets 111: Charles Barkley scored 34 points, and Ron Anderson added 14 of his 22 in the fourth quarter as Philadelphia, playing at home, ended the Bullets' four-game winning streak. Philadelphia held a 110-102 lead with 3:27 left, but Washington closed to 112-108 on a jumper by Jeff Malone with 2:01 remaining. Barkley then made a free throw and passed to Mike Gminski for a layup with 1:21 left to secure the victory.(AP) Celtics 113, Jazz 109: Larry Bird scored 40 points and Kevin McHale had 13 of his 19 points in the third quarter as Boston beat Utah for the 19th consecutive time in Boston Garden. The Celtics outscored Utah by 13-3 at the end of the third period for a 90-77 lead, then had to ward off challenges down the stretch by the Jazz, who have not won in Boston since joining the N.B.A. as a New Orleans franchise in 1974. Utah, which was led by Karl Malone with 39 points, ran off 9 consecutive points at the start of the fourth period to close to 90-86. But the Celtics responded with an 8-2 run. Blue Edwards had 19 points, Thurl Bailey had 18 and John Stockton added 15 for the Jazz.(AP) Lakers 106, Timberwolves 97: Orlando Woolridge scored a season-high 20 points, including the first 4 by his team in overtime, to lead the visiting Lakers. The Timberwolves, who never trailed in regulation and scored only 38 points in the last 29 minutes, have lost seven straight games. Magic Johnson's layup with seven seconds left in regulation gave the Lakers their first tie at 91-91. In overtime, Woolridge made two free throws for a 93-91 lead, the Lakers' first free throws of the game. Tony Campbell, who scored 26 points, made a jumper to tie the game, but Woolridge's layup put the Lakers up for good with 3:22 remaining.(AP) N.H.L. Red Wings 4, Maple Leafs 2: Glen Hanlon, the Detroit goaltender, turned aside 26 shots last night and Joe Kocur snapped a 1-1 tie with a second-period goal to lead Detroit at home. Detroit, 5-2-2 in its last nine games, stopped the Maple Leafs, who had won five of their last six. Hanlon, 4-1-2 in his seven starts since returning from a groin injury, surrendered Gary Leeman's first-period goal and another to John Kordic in the third. The veteran goaltender's biggest save came early in the second period when he stopped Daniel Marois on a breakaway to keep the score tied, 1-1. After Leeman and Shawn Burr traded first-period goals, Kocur scored his sixth of the season to put Detroit ahead to stay.(AP) Whalers 4, Bruins 3: Ron Francis of Hartford scored his 17th goal of the season on a deflection with 25 seconds left to lead the Whalers at home. Dave Babych intercepted Ray Bourque's clearing pass at the left point and his blast was redirected by Francis past the goaltender Andy Moog. Todd Krygier, Ed Kastelic and Dean Evason also scored for Hartford (18-17-1), which went over .500 for the first time since Nov. 14. The Whalers are 7-3 since Nov. 30. Andy Brickley, Craig Janney and Randy Burridge scored for Boston (17-14-3).(AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL Illinois 101, Missouri 93: Kendall Gill scored 27 points last night and keyed a 12-4 run midway through the second half for Illinois (7-0). Illinois used the spurt to open a 72-62 lead and Missouri (9-1) never got closer than 7 points the rest of the way despite a closing flurry by Anthony Peeler. Illinois claimed its seventh straight triumph in the series and the Fighting Illini raised their record to 8-1 over all against Missouri at the St. Louis Arena, a neutral site. Marcus Liberty added 26 points for Illinois. Missouri led five times in the first half, enjoying a 22-17 edge before Gill and Liberty sparked a 23-8 surge that put Illinois ahead 40-30. Nathan Buntin hit a 3-pointer to bring Missouri to within 45-40 at halftime. Missouri challenged at 58-56 when Buntin scored inside with 13:49 to go, and at 60-58 less than a minute later. Small started the Illini's decisive surge with an inside basket and, after Coward countered for Missouri, Gill then scored two baskets to spark the run.(AP) Georgetown 97, Virginia Tech 64: Mark Tillmon scored 29 points and Alonzo Mourning added 27 last night as Georgetown won its 25th straight home game. Georgetown (8-0) has outscored its opponents by 777-475 this season, a 37-point average margin of victory. Mourning also had 11 rebounds and Dikeme Mutombo had 10 points and 12 rebounds for Georgetown, which has not lost at the Capital Centre since the 1987-88 season when St. John's beat the Hoyas, 65-58. Virginia Tech's Bimbo Coles, who is trying to become the first player in Metro Conference history to lead the league in scoring three years, finished with 22 points. He is the only member of the Hokies (4-3) averaging in double figures.(AP) HORSE RACING Bold Wench Is Winner: Bold Wench took the lead on the backstretch and held it the rest of the way for a one and one-half length victory in the Kittiwake Handicap for fillies and mares at Aqueduct yesterday.

Thousands of political arrests are made, and the Communists gain full control. 1952: After a purge in the Communist Party, the Government adopts a new Constitution closer to the Soviet model. 1965: Nicolae Ceausescu becomes Communist Party chief. 1968: The Government denounces the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia - the most striking example of Bucharest's independence of Moscow in foreign policy. It also has maintained diplomatic relations with Israel after the Middle East war of 1967, and it became the first Eastern bloc country to recognize West Germany. 1981: Rumania begins to introduce policies to eliminate a foreign debt of more than $11 billion by the end of the decade. Over the years the measures include widespread, severe cuts in residential and industrial energy use and a basic disregard for consumer needs. May 1987: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union visits, but President Ceausescu indicates that the reforms taking place in other Eastern bloc countries will not be introduced in Rumania. November 1987: After months of energy rationing made worse by severe weather, thousands of people, led by workers at a tractor factory, march through the city of Brasov to protest a decline in living standards. Authorities make hundreds of arrests. Similar disturbances break out later in other cities, including the western city of Timisoara. March 1988: The President announces a program calling for the demolition of up to 8,000 villages and the resettlement of their residents, including about 50,000 Hungarians, in housing complexes. The program draws internal and international criticism and severely strains relations between Rumania and Hungary. Dec. 16, 1989: Rumanian security forces begin a crackdown on tens of thousands of protesters in Timisoara. There are reports that as many as 2,000 people were killed. President Ceausescu blames ''fascist reactionary groups.'' Dec. 21: Demonstrations spread to Bucharest.",1989-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Pop/Jazz; Two Groups Recapture The Sounds Of the 50's,"One of the lessons that 1980's pop culture has taught is that nothing really disappears. So enormous is the nostalgic appetite for the moods and attitudes of the past that sooner or later even the most despised pop kitsch becomes ripe for resurrection As recently as a decade ago, a revue devoted to the insipid American pop of the Mitch Miller era would probably not have found an audience. Rock-and-roll, though heading into middle age at that time, still reigned supreme. But to a younger pop audience that has grown up in the more conservative, conformist 80's, the wholesome pop iconography of the 50's doesn't seem so remote. That may explain why youthful crowds are flocking to two amusing cabaret revues, both of which celebrate music that rock-and-roll was supposed to have eradicated forever.",1989-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide: Near Downtown Theaters,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current. Indochine ** (Nov. 25, 1988), 430 Lafayette Street (505-5111) - This still-trendy, somewhat noisy restaurant across from the Public Theater serves a vivid mix of Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisines. One of the best starters here is sweet and sour shrimp soup, generous with perfectly cooked shrimp and flavored with pineapple and tamarind. Vegetable spring rolls with crab are another bright appetizer. The gray sole fillet steamed in banana leaves with lemon grass and coconut milk is worth seeking out for a main course, as are deep-fried chicken wings stuffed with vermicelli, vegetables and diced chicken. Appetizers are $5.50 to $11.50; entrees, $10.50 to $16.50. Dinner from 6 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. daily. John Clancy's ** (March 11, 1988), 181 West 10th Street (242-7350) - Among reasons to recommend this handsome all-seafood restaurant are the chef's talent at mesquite grilling and the congenial, very professional staff. Always included in the eight or so daily entree specials is a fish served whole on the bone, a preparation that enhances flavor and texture. The entrees might be grilled whole red snapper or whole sea bass with cilantro. Another winner is the halibut steak in sesame sauce. Portions are large here, so diners may want to opt for a light appetizer, like oysters on the half shell. John Clancy's is one of the few restaurants in New York that serves authentic English trifle, a rich composition of sherry-soaked genoise, raspberry puree, creme anglaise and whipped cream. Appetizers are $4.50 to $11, entrees $16 to $30.50. Open from 5:30 to 11 P.M. Monday to Saturday, 5 to 10 P.M. Sunday. K-Paul's New York * (Nov. 17, 1989), 622 Broadway, south of Bleecker Street (460-9633) -The Cajun cooking virtuoso Paul Prudhomme serves his Louisiana specialties in a spacious downtown location five nights a week. The room is dominated by a glassed-in kitchen as long as a bowling alley. When Mr. Prudhomme is not in attendance there, the food can lose something. Dinners begin with a basket of irresistible breads like cheddar-jalapeno rolls. The signature appetizer is Cajun popcorn (fried puffs of battered crayfish); another good choice is the seafood gumbo. Main courses to recommend include swordfish with hot fanny sauce, blackened prime rib of beef, and blackened tuna steak. Appetizers are $6 to $10, main courses $18 to $28. Dinner served 5:30 to 11 P.M., Monday to Friday only. La Metairie * (Nov. 23, 1984), 189 West 10th Street (989-0343) - The downtown branch of La Metairie is one of the city's most diminutive restaurants, having just 16 seats. With its lace-curtained windows, candlelight and caged doves, it is also one of the more romantic places to dine near West Village theaters. Two appetizers on the current menu are fresh cured salmon with anise served over cucumber and frisee, and mushroom ravioli made with chanterelles and morels. For main courses, there are roasted monkfish sliced over melted leeks and ginger, and breast of duck with green-apple demiglace. For dessert there is a nicely glazed tarte Tatin. Appetizers are $7 to $18, entrees $18 to $26. Open 6 to 10:30 P.M. Monday to Saturday. What the stars mean, page C30.",1989-12-22T05:00:00+0000

He had been imprisoned on treason charges by King Carol II, who ruled with a handpicked coalition called the Front of National Renascence. 1940: Rumania, neutral at the outbreak of World Ear II, adopts a pro-German orientation. Nevertheless, when Hungary demands the return of territories annexed by Rumania after World War I, Nazi Germany favors Humgary. Rumania is compelled to cede northern Transylvania to Hungary. The Soviet Union demands and receives Bessarable, which becomes the Moldavian Soviet Republic. June 1941: Rumania joins the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. August 1944: Soviet forces enter the country, and the Government, led by Marshall Ion Antonescu, is overthrown. March 1945: Under Soviet pressure, King Michael accepts a Communist-led coalition Government. 1946: Elections usher in a Communist-dominated bloc with 89 percent of the vote. Opposition parties charge fraud. Dec. 30, 1947: The King abdicates and the Rumanian People's Republic is proclaimed. Nationalization of the country's industries and banks begins as the Communists gain control. 1952: The party comes under the control of Gheorghiu-Dej, a longtime revolutionary who begins loosening ties with the Soviets and cultivating Yugoslavia, China and the West. 1965: Nicolae Ceausescu becomes Communist Party chief on the death of Gheorghiu-Dej. 1968: The Government denounces the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the most striking example of Bucharest's independence of Moscow in foreign policy. May 1987: President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union visits, but President Ceausescu indicates that the liberalization taking place in other Eastern bloc countries will not be introduced in Rumania. November 1987: After months of energy rationing made worse by severe weather, thousands of workers march through Brasov to protest a decline in living standards. The authroities make hundreds of arrests. March 1988: The President announces a program to demolish 8,000 villages and resettle residents, including about 50,000 ethnic Hungarians, in urban housing complexes. The action frays relations between Rumania and Hungary. Dec. 16, 1989: Rumanian security forces begin a crackdown on protesters in Timisoara. There are reports that as many as 2,000 are killed. President Ceausescu blames ''facist reactionary groups.'' Dec. 21: Demonstrations spread to Bucharest. Dec. 22: President Ceausescu is overthrown.

Whitefish is better, especially when left its natural golden color. Good salmon roe is rich and briny. The best caviar is always fresh, not pasteurized, and a pound is usually measured at 14 ounces. As for fine sturgeon caviar, these are the choices: TYPE: Beluga CHARACTERISTICS: From giant Caspian Sea sturgeon. The rarest, largest and most costly eggs, usually black; most delicate flavor. PRICE: $400 to $700 TYPE: Osetra CHARACTERISTICS: Smaller than beluga, and often a lighter color; has a rich, nutty flavor. PRICE: $160 to $400 TYPE: Sevruga CHARACTERISTICS: Smallest, least expensive Caspian Sea caviar. Not so distinctive as osetra PRICE: $120 to $250 TYPE: Pressed CHARACTERISTICS: Very rich, fairly salty jamlike paste of broken caviar. PRICE: About $100 TYPE: American CHARACTERISTICS: From native sturgeon; similar to sevruga. PRICE: $75 to $150 TYPE: Chinese CHARACTERISTICS: From large Amur River sturgeon; like beluga or osetra, but usually grayish green. PRICE: $200 to $350",1989-12-23T05:00:00+0000

The state security police reportedly remained loyal to the President. Fierce fighting was reported. 1 News analysis: The armed rebellion in Rumania proves that no hard-line Communist government in Eastern Europe can evade the popular wrath sweeping the region. 1 Mass graves were found in Rumania. In Timisoara, townspeople said 4,500 corpses of those massacred by the security forces in last weekend's crackdown were buried in three graves. 1 An old Communist Party stalwart at Rumania's barricades 9 The U.S. will offer aid to Rumania as it did to Poland and Hungary if the new government that emerges in Bucharest adopts similar political and economic reforms, the Bush Administration said. 10 Soviets welcome the uprising against Ceausescu 10 The Brandenburg Gate was opened by the leaders of the two Germanys, breaching a barrier that has long symbolized the division of East and West. 7 High prices dampen Hungary's holiday 7 Gen.

The newly installed Junior Vice President narrowly escaped assassination when he was attacked as he left the National Assembly. Bands of armed looters roamed Panama City's streets. 1 President Bush ordered more troops into Panama to reinforce the 24,000-member American force amid concerns about the slow pace of efforts to gain control of the capital. 13 Gen.

us,"Pei, Prince Charles - and Skyscrapers Everywhere","IN ARCHITECTURE, THIS WAS SURE-ly the year of I. M. Pei: not a new face, to be sure, but an omnipresent one. In Paris, Mr. Pei's glass pyramid in the court of the Louvre, the object of bitter controversy for years, opened in April to an almost entirely positive reaction. Those who had always thought a crystal pyramid was the right idea for a new entrance and virtual logo for the Louvre rejoiced in self-satisfaction that the 72-year-old Mr. Pei had maneuvered his way through the political thicket so skillfully; the doubters generally came around, moved by the extraordinary beauty of Mr. Pei's exquisitely crafted object and by the extent to which it did allow the older buildings of the Louvre to maintain their integrity. In the end, the quibbles were minor: the way the three little pyramids placed beside the main one trivialized the composition, for example, or the way the staircase was detailed - hardly enough to deny the success of the project as an example of what Mr. Pei does best, which is to create a true civic monumentality in the modernist mode. And that is what the architect did as well in his second major public building to be finished last year, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas. Opened in September, the Meyerson could be called a grand concert hall in the new style: it aspires to the luxury and monumentality of the great classical halls, but the architecture is mainly Mr. Pei's modernist geometries. Its swooping shapes of glass and limestone are a bit too abstract on the outside, but inside, the auditorium, which has somewhat of the air of Viennese modernism to it, is warm and pleasing.",1989-12-24T05:00:00+0000

As the audience watches, objects and images shift and assume radically different, often metaphorical form. A jaguar cub is reborn as a boy (named Juan Darien), and, suffering at the hands of his fellow man, he is driven back to his beastly origins. In this ''carnival Mass,'' civilization and savagery repeatedly collide. The show is the stage equivalent of the magic realism of novelists like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende.

If it's St. Barts the Kleins choose, they will just be part of the usual celebrity deluge that engulfs the little island at holiday time.

us,IN SHORT: Fiction,"DEADLINE. By Tom Stacey. (St. Martin's, $13.95.) This very brief, sometimes annoying and often compelling adventure novel by a real Fleet Street foreign correspondent, which features a fictional Fleet Street correspondent, raises some essential questions about their profession. Is the foreign correspondent (or the local reporter, for that matter) a keen-eyed, sharp-minded observer of life, the public's representative at rebellions and earthquakes? Or is the reporter a hack, a vulture, living off the carrion of other people's failures and tragedies? What does it mean that Tom Stacey's hero, Gran Jones, has gained in his work ''an extraordinary global eclecticism''? That he was smarter than his informed sources? Or that he was really a jack-of-all-trades, a dilettante? Jones, an aging British newspaperman, lives in virtual retirement in an oil-rich state in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Stacey chooses to leave it nameless, which rankles, but the place sounds like Abu Dhabi or Dubai. ''Deadline'' is only 122 pages long, and the publisher notes that it has already been a television production in Britain, which suggests that the book was an afterthought to the script. We are asked to believe that in his time Jones has interviewed all the makers of midcentury history - including Khrushchev, Churchill and the Shah of Iran. There is no explicit report that he settled any revolutions in Spain, but Hitler did phone him for advice. Soon after ''Deadline'' begins, there is a coup in Jones's adopted homeland and he drags himself after one more scoop, competing with the whippersnappers of the press and television. Flashbacks tell of Jones's history - why he left his wife for a younger woman, why he is now alone, working on a book he seems unlikely to finish. But it's the descriptions of Jones's daily routine, intercut with his memories, that are the strength of the novel; they make us need to know how Jones's personal story comes out, whether he will get his last big exclusive. Still, they aren't quite enough to flesh out this very skimpy thriller. It's too bad Mr. Stacey couldn't have brought Jones's lover, his wife, his children to fuller life, or made his professional past more plausible. For Gran Jones is a familiar character, and essentially a true one, and he deserves better treatment.",1989-12-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: Nonfiction,"THE DIVERTED DREAM: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900-1985. By Steven Brint and Jerome Karabel. (Oxford University, $24.95.) The United States sends more of its young people to college than any other nation in the world. Approximately half of them are enrolled in community colleges, where they are channeled into low- and mid-level technical and vocational programs. It is this paradox between the democratization of higher education and the tracking of students into a highly stratified occupational structure that Steven Brint and Jerome Karabel address in ''The Diverted Dream.'' In the process they attempt to explain both the phenomenal growth and the particular orientation of today's two-year institutions. Small liberal-arts ''junior'' colleges, designed to prepare students for transferring to four-year colleges, were transformed into large-scale ''community'' colleges, intended to provide large segments of the population with vocational programs and terminal degrees. This change required a lengthy and substantial effort, including the use of testing and guidance services, to persuade students and their parents to lower their aspirations. Mr. Brint, who teaches sociology at Yale University, and Mr. Karabel, who teaches sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, reject the notions that the transformation occurred because students-as-consumers chose vocational tracks and that business and industry played a dominant role in shaping this transformation. Instead, they argue, the leaders of the community college movement fashioned a particular mission to secure a niche for themselves in the competitive educational marketplace. The book is well documented and raises important questions about the role of education in our society. For the working class and minority students that predominate in two-year institutions, this book serves as a cruel reminder of the limits of opportunity in a class-structured society.

It was not for her lack of trying, however, and Nigel Dempster, a columnist for The London Daily Mail, tells all in ''Heiress.'' He divulges that a nearly 200-pound Onassis paid Luis Sosa Balsuado, an Argentine polo player, $1,000 a day for companionship and sex. The ungrateful Mr. Balsuado called her ''about as sexy as a wallowing hippo.'' A slimmer Christina gave her fourth husband, the Frenchman Thierry Roussell, $10 million as a wedding gift, but he returned to his old flame, Gaby Landhage. If the billionaire's battle against obesity cramped her love life, it did not inhibit her social life. People happily accepted invitations to Skorpios, her family's private Greek island. But she rudely asked them to leave if they did not play by her rule: no going to bed before the hostess. And Onassis, an amphetamine abuser, liked to dance all night. Abusing her body apparently took its toll, and Onassis died in November 1988 of a heart attack at the age of 37. Mr. Dempster softens his unflattering biography by references from friends and relatives that blame Onassis' parents for her behavior. Christina looked to men to provide the love she missed as a child, they say; her Dior-dressed dolls and the best nannies and tutors were no substitute for parental attention. Mr. Dempster's look at Onassis' life is as shallow as the gossip on which it is based, merely echoing the poor-little-rich-girl view of the heiress already provided by the news media.",1989-12-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: Fiction,"WALK WITH THE SICKLE MOON. By Helen Norris. (Birch Lane/Carol Publishing, $15.95.) A misty coastal town in the north of France. A lonely but attractive American widow. An attractive but lonely local doctor. A quest. It's autumn in Montreuil, nine years after World War II has ended, and it seems that romance is as inevitable as rain. That's just the trouble with Helen Norris's fourth novel; it's a formula, so almost everything is inevitable. Laura Kendall, in search of the child that her son, once stationed in France, had fathered before he died, finds the answers she needs about lineage and love in a kind of made-for-television manner. We're way ahead of her most of the time. When her car skids off a country road, we know that her rescuer is Someone Special. When she takes tea with another guest at her hotel, she coincidentally meets a ''fair-haired boy, perhaps six or seven,'' who is learning English. The dialogue doesn't help inject much realism; it's frequently stilted because the characters talk across a language barrier, in ''translatable'' phrases. Eventually, all this starts to bother even the author. Near the end of ''Walk With the Sickle Moon,'' the hero jokes that certain events could turn out ''like a bad novel.'' By then it's too late for apologies.",1989-12-24T05:00:00+0000

Armed resistance by forces loyal to the late dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, tapered off. Page A1 New Government wins some foreign support despite criticism A11 The burials have begun in Bucharest amid a somber realization that the precise number of Rumanians killed will never be known. A1 The avarice of Nicolae Ceausescu and his family is being laid before the Rumanian people. The military tribunal that ordered their execution accused them of salting away $1 billion in foreign bank accounts. A10 Videotape of trial shows defiant Ceausescus A11 Lithuania's break from the Kremlin was denounced by the Communist Party Central Committee, which rallied behind President Mikhail Gorbachev, who said he would visit the republic to meet with rank-and-file party members. A1 The diplomatic impasse in Panama over the fate of Gen. Manuel Noriega continued as a semblance of normalcy returned to the capital. Businesses and Government offices opened for the first time since the American attack. A1 Experts doubt the Vatican will yield Noriega to U.S. A15 Efforts to denigrate Gen. Noriega were pressed further in an unusual report by the American military command in Panama describing him as a ''truly evil man'' who wore red underwear and associated with prostitutes. A14 Gen. Noriega's drug-related assets, believed to exceed $10 million deposited in several European countries, should be frozen, the Bush Administration said. A15 U.S. hopes Noriega prosecution is stronger A15 Cuba asks council for action on U.S., citing harassment A15 Nicaragua is shocked and frustrated by the weak international outcry against the American attack on Panama, the kind of military action they have long feared in their own country, officials say. A14 Amity with Palestinians, not emnity, is preferable, said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, as he pledged to push plans for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in spite of opposition. A3 Israel attacked two bases in Lebanon belonging to the Lebanese Communist Party. An air strike near Beirut followed an earlier ground attack by elite troops in southern Lebanon, killing at least four people. A3 Israelis should forgive the Nazis, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said. It was the latest in a series of comments that have irked some Israelis during his Christmas visit to the Holy Land. A5 Africa's spot on the global agenda could slip downward with all the attention placed on Eastern Europe by the world's powers, African officials say. A6 India will not buy Swedish arms made by Bofors, the company reportedly involved in a kickback scheme with the administration of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced. A7 National A16-21 Low doses of the AIDS drug AZT are as effective as the current standard dose and less likely to cause side effects, experts say, but some patients are still suffering the side effects because of Government delays in approving lower dosages. A19 A plan for universal health insurance proposed by the head of a bipartisan Government commission would require employers to provide coverage for all employees or pay a tax to help provide it. A16 Organs of three fire victims help keep others alive A21 Day care for students' babies is being provided in a small but growing number of high schools around the country that are addressing the leading reason why girls drop out of school: motherhood. A20 The frigid weather across the South has left much of Houston without water. Temperatures were back in the 70's, but broken pipes and low water pressure meant no showers or drinking water for residents. A21 Saving the Old South in Savannah, Ga., has become a contentious issue between those who want to preserve the city's historic past and ensure its economic future.

Improvements in roads, bridges and other public works systems this decade have begun to reverse a legacy of decay.

Both times, after the paint dried it looked streaky and showed the brush strokes in a sort of two-toned black. We would like a nice even flat black appearance. What are we doing to make it so streaky? A.It sounds as if the paint is much too thick, or you are brushing it on in layers that are too heavy. You are also probably brushing back and forth over the same section too many times. Paint should never be so thick it does not brush on easily, and it should flow together slightly as it goes on.

The loss was the fifth straight for Cleveland. Tripucka, who was benched before the game, was booed continuously. He cried at midcourt after the game and criticized the Hornets' fans. Tripucka, with a .375 shooting percentage this season, hit his first 5 shots in the game and wound up hitting 11 of 17. His jump shot from the corner with 1 minutes 33 seconds left broke an 88-88 tie, and his two free throws with six seconds to play sealed the victory. Tripucka and Tyrone (Muggsy) Bogues started all 23 of the Hornets' previous games but were benched last night by Coach Dick Harter, who was trying to shake up his team. Robert Reid started at point guard, with Rex Chapman at shooting guard and Dell Curry in Tripucka's place at small forward.

That was in line with expectations and was seen as a further indication that the nation's sharply slower economic growth is unlikely to deteriorate into a recession. Five of the index's 11 components contributed to the increase, led by a rise in manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials. [ 33. ] Farmers received 0.7 percent more for raw products in December than in November, the Agriculture Department said. [ 34. ] The United States is headed for permanent levels of dependence on oil imports higher than those that led to havoc in the 1970's, many experts are saying. [ 33. ] MARKETS Stock prices rose strongly, ending the second-best year of the decade, in percentage terms, for the Dow industrials. The Dow settled at 2,753.20, up 20.90 for the day, 41.81 for the week and 584.63, or 27 percent, for the year. [ 33. ] Treasury note and bond prices were mostly lower, and bill rates were mixed, in the final trading session of a year characterized by gradually rising prices of Treasury and investment-grade corporate debt issues and by declining values of ''junk bonds.'' [ 36. ] Prices of heating-oil futures rebounded to close at a six-year high, and gasoline futures jumped amid signs that moves to produce more heating oil are cutting into gas supplies. [ 41. ] The dollar closed higher in light trading. Gold prices rose, with bullion for current delivery ending at $402.50 an ounce on the Comex. [ 41. ] COMPANIES Antonovich Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The move by the New York-area fur retailer follows the announcement by a competitor, Fur Vault, that it would sell its unprofitable retail operations. Fur retailers face new competition from foreign companies, like Jindo of Korea, and are under pressure from animal rights groups. [ 33. ] Some airlines are seriously considering raising fares or adding ticket surcharges to offset higher fuel prices, people in the industry say. The moves could come just before the time of year when carriers generally cut their fares. [ 33. ] The City of Chicago plans to terminate its franchise agreement with Commonwealth Edison as of Dec. 31, 1990, the company said. Analysts see the action as a first step in negotiations for a new franchise agreement with the big electric utility.

Rilwanu Lukman also serves as president of OPEC. [ 34. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Patents for financial instruments are being validated at the Patent and Trademark Office and in court.

us,The Perfect Party Food,"Shrimp are America's favorite shellfish. And they make wonderful hors d'oeuvres at parties on New Year's Eve or any other time. Caterers say guests consume twice as many shrimp as any other cocktail food. Virtually all shrimp in markets have been frozen and are sold thawed. They are graded according to size or number of pieces per pound. The larger the shrimp, the higher the price. The flavor varies; a strong iodine taste can be caused by the shrimp's diet or a lack of freshness. Shrimp should be cooked very briefly. They are done as soon as the flesh turns opaque, often less than a minute after being placed in boiling water. Cooking them in salty water will give them better flavor. Here is a guide to how much to buy: $ Size Shrimp per pound Price Small 40 to 60 $6 to $8 Medium 31 to 40 $10 Large 21 to 30 $12 Extra Large 15 to 20 $15 Jumbo 10 to 14 $17 to $20 Giant prawn 3 to 9 $20 to $25",1989-12-30T05:00:00+0000

It is safe to say that every great singer, and thousands of lesser ones, made records. Eventually their original records disappeared, but they were not lost. For when the LP disk came along in 1948 many record companies that specialized in transferring the vocal art to the new medium jumped into the breach.

In fact, they're apt to be experiencing serious apprehension. ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is a film with a painful subject, and it's the work of a director extremely adept at inflicting pain. It's clear that Oliver Stone isn't one to regard moviegoing as a passive experience. Part of his method is to make audiences squirm. Mr. Stone, who sends his actors to boot camp as a means of preparing them to play soldiers, clearly believes in the power of experience to hammer home ideas that might otherwise remain abstract. All of his films, even ''Wall Street'' (with the soul-searching comeuppance it affords Charlie Sheen's ambitious young stockbroker) and certainly the jittery, volatile ''Salvador,'' the frighteningly ominous ''Platoon'' and the vituperative ''Talk Radio,'' are harrowing to watch. And the anxiety they generate in audiences is a significant part of what makes these films work.

Federal investigators say that Mr. Gigante, who is sometimes seen walking the streets of Greenwich Village wearing a robe and muttering to himself, is the undisputed boss of the Genovese crime family and is faking mental illness to discourage possible indictments. Mr. Gigante's brother, the Rev. Louis Gigante, a South Bronx priest, has asked to be appointed to manage his affairs on the ground that Vincent is mentally incompetent. A psychiatrist retained by the Gigantes said that Vincent ''suffers from hallucinations and delusions of persecution.'' If the court agrees and puts Mr. Gigante's property in his relatives' care, it might be difficult to confiscate his holdings as part of a criminal prosecution.

us,In Short: Fiction,"From Liverpool, With Hysteria ''So this is America,'' Ringo Starr said 25 years ago when several thousand wailing fans greeted the Beatles at Kennedy International Airport. ''They all seem out of their minds.'' A. J. S. Rayl, who has reported on the entertainment industry for a number of publications, and the freelance photographer Curt Gunther, who was lucky enough to tag along with Brian Epstein and his four charges as they crisscrossed this country, have put together BEATLES '64: A Hard Day's Night in America (Doubleday, $24.95), a tribute to Beatlemania in pictures and words. Ms. Rayl's text, closer in spirit to Iron Butterfly's ''In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida'' than to ''I Want to Hold Your Hand,'' rumbles along endlessly as it follows the concert tour from city to city, concentrating on just how many policemen were on hand to protect John, Paul, George and Ringo and just how many girls turned out to maul them. We also get the usual sentimental hooey about the Beatles' helping people forget the assassination of John F. Kennedy (''A new Camelot was rising from the ashes of the old''), when what they really wanted to forget was the music of Frankie Avalon and the Singing Nun. Still, there are Mr. Gunther's photographs. Many of these 150 previously unpublished black-and-white shots catch the boys at their most puckish, clowning around with Fats Domino in New Orleans and with one another everywhere else; a few of the photos, especially one or two of John Lennon, are truly memorable, even haunting. Notable, too, are the pictures of all those teen-age Beatlemaniacs, most of whom managed to look as straitlaced as any Young Republican. But they didn't act like Young Republicans. At the last stop on the tour, a benefit performance in New York City, the crowd hooted Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme as well as the other opening acts. ''Get off the stage!'' the kids shouted.

us,When Justice Goes Wrong,"JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE: Battered Women, Self-Defense, and the Law. By Cynthia K. Gillespie. (Ohio State University, $24.95.) The idea in our law that it is excusable to kill in self-defense goes back to medieval England. The cases that led to the development of the common law on self-defense fell into two classes: there were the highway-robber cases, where an unknown assailant sets upon someone who, in fighting back, kills his attacker; and then there were the barroom brawls, in which a dispute between two men escalates into a dangerous armed battle. Neither scenario has much to do with the realities of life for battered women who kill their husbands - and, as Cynthia Gillespie's analysis in ''Justifiable Homicide: Battered Women, Self-Defense, and the Law'' reveals, neither does the modern-day law under which such killings are judged. For one thing, the law presumes parties who are of roughly the same size and strength. Then, too, in order to encourage honorable manly behavior - no shooting in the back, no guns pulled on unarmed fighters - the law says that killing in self-defense is generally sanctioned only where the killer was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm, where there was no retreat, and where the killer used only as much force as his victim. But as applied to battered women, these rules can be terribly unfair. If a woman has for years been beaten, raped, tortured and threatened by her husband, and he now has his hands around her throat and is choking her, is she justified in picking up a gun and shooting him? In case after case, the courts have said no, and sent her to prison for doing so. Ms. Gillespie has found more than 200 horrifying cases along these lines, each one more gruesome than the last. In most, the women have suffered years of beating, years of serious injuries and years of neglect by the police and family court authorities. It is often painful reading, but Ms. Gillespie's careful research, and her stirring accounts of justice gone wrong, make a strong case for rethinking the law of self-defense.",1989-12-31T05:00:00+0000

us,In Short: NONFICTION,"JUST ENOUGH ROPE: An Intimate Memoir. By Joan Braden. (Villard, $19.95.) Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious ''open'' marriage. The title, ''Just Enough Rope,'' refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband, the syndicated columnist Tom Braden. Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this ''intimate memoir.'' This reviewer does not take such a harsh view. After all, how can a book be all bad that features a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing ''High Hopes'' without his toupee? Not to mention the report of a birthday party for Bobby Kennedy with such guests as Kim Novak, Angie Dickinson and Marilyn Monroe, at which Marilyn asked Bobby questions she had written out in advance with red lipstick on a piece of paper. (''What,'' she asked breathily, ''does an attorney general do?'') Ms. Braden offers these ''ancient truths'' and ''tribal instincts'': ''Never ever go to a dinner party when you're ill.'' ''When a man says to me, 'If my wife knew that I was having lunch with you, she'd have a fit,' I put him down as unenlightened and something of a boor and I try not to have lunch with him again.'' ''Only a woman could ever know Nelson Rockefeller.'' ''Hindsight and experience tell me that alone with a man, a woman who decides to take a shower is asking for trouble.'' ''Women journalists, like other working women, have good reason for knowing that the great American workplace is full of attractions to sex, propositions for sex, and adventures in sex. . . . I think they tend to overemphasize sex.'' ''Tom and I don't have to cheat. We trust.''

The fact that there are deadbeat dads who don't pay child support is reprehensible. It makes all dads look bad. However, on behalf of the innocent children of divorce everywhere, there might be other factors to consider. A lot of New Jersey fathers are paying several times the national average child support payment. Yet unqualified judges are allowing children to be moved out of the state where living expenses are but a fraction of those here in New Jersey. When this occurs, one can't help but wonder, ''Where is my money going?'' Nonetheless, most of these dads will continue to obey the law - for the sake of the child. Perhaps there should be an accountability law - a court-ordered directive to make certain the child is indeed receiving that support. Maybe then, these ''bum dads'' would be more amenable to the laws of the state. JOE PISCOPO Alpine",1989-12-31T05:00:00+0000

us,In Short: Nonfiction,"MEMOIRS OF A BASTARD ANGEL. By Harold Norse. (Morrow, $22.95.) From an audacious opening (''Call me bastard'') to a coyly symmetrical ending more than 400 pages later (''This is but the draft of a draft, as Melville said of Moby Dick''), Harold Norse's ''Memoirs of a Bastard Angel'' charts a colorful life rich in literary affiliations but lacking in fulfilled ambitions. A poet and ''charter member of the 'Beat Generation','' Mr. Norse retraces a path beginning in New York City in the 1930's, passing through Europe in the 50's and ending up in California in the 60's. He emerges as a peripatetic priapus, apportioning his interests between belletristic concerns and homosexual escapades. With lingering affection for some and noticeable animosity toward others, Mr. Norse recalls his associations with W. H. Auden, James Baldwin, Julian Beck, Paul Bowles, Charles Bukowski, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Goodman, Christopher Isherwood, James Jones, Anais Nin, Ned Rorem and Tennessee Williams - to breathlessly name but a few. Mr. Norse ultimately betrays his own resentments: ''It seems that many times in my life I have been the bearer of fame and fortune to others by some word or instruction that I have passed on. But I haven't always been that lucky myself.'' The greater irony is that it is the less famous and more nameless figures who come most alive - the shopkeepers, socialites and anonymous ''tricks'' who peopled Mr. Norse's life. Intermittently humorous and didactic, the book is encumbered by a tendency to include too many encomiums: ''In 1951, William Carlos Williams wrote, 'You are the best poet of your generation.' I was discovered - again.'' Mr. Norse is constantly being rediscovered but is still waiting to be found.",1989-12-31T05:00:00+0000

It is riven by cracks, some the width of your hand, others wide enough to squeeze an arm or leg into. There are ledges you could stand on and protruding rock crystals and horns you could grab hold of. It is possible to conceive of a line that would follow these natural features of the rock all the way up, 300 feet, to the top. Since the 1950's, the Shawangunk escarpment has been perhaps the main rock-climbing center east of the Rockies.
