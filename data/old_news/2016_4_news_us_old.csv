The ruling established that intercepts of Mr. da Silvas phone calls should be reviewed by the court because some of the calls included conversations with senior officials who enjoy special judicial standing. The court has still not ruled on whether President Dilma Rousseffs nomination of Mr. da Silva to her cabinet, a move suspended in March by Justice Gilmar Mendes, should be allowed.

us,Inside the List,"Where Theres a Will: Cynthia DAprix Sweeney, a former copywriter who returned to school in her 50s, made news a couple of years ago when her debut novel, The Nest, sold for seven figures. (Interviewing her for The Los Angeles Times recently, the author Meredith Maran began, Tell me why I shouldnt hate you.) But in publishing as in politics, a big war chest alone doesnt necessarily ensure success. Money is very important, the eminent publisher Howard Kaminsky told this newspaper in 1985, in an article headlined Why Best Sellers Sell Best, and Other Publishing Secrets. (The short version: Nobody knows.) But theres no guarantee of money making something happen. You need a book with intrinsic value, even if its frivolous intrinsic value. Now Sweeneys novel is out, and early reviews confirm that The Nest  a dark comedy about adult siblings squabbling over their lost inheritance  is worth the buzz. Still, Sweeney has maintained a sense of perspective. Were not people who are flashily trying to get attention, she said of herself and her writer friends in a recent profile in New York magazine. Whatever props we get, its just because were diligent workers. Or, as she put it in her interview with Maran: Its not like I went out there saying, Ill only accept a million dollars for this book. Its lunacy, that much money. On the other hand, I wish the publishing world was structured differently, so an author getting paid a lot for her book wasnt such a rare thing that its news. I wrote the book I wanted to write. I was just hoping someone would want it. She can stop worrying on that count: The Nest enters the hardcover fiction list at No.3.",2016-04-01T15:12:19+0000

The new rules threaten Pfizers proposed $150 billion takeover of Allergan, a drug maker based in Dublin.

On the ramen front, hes breaking new ground: There are four varieties on the menu, all available in two sizes. His long-simmered pork chashu, the basis of many ramen dishes, is cut into thin ribbons using a classic red Italian hand-cranked ham slicer on the bar. And with Sun Noodle, his supplier, he developed a noodle that does not become soggy as quickly as most. Some of the ramen bowls are classic, like the tonkotsu, though Mr. Morimotos executive chef, Jae Lee, is Korean, and was given the liberty to indulge his taste for chiles and kimchi in a number of dishes. Morimoto likes the fusion approach, Mr. Lee said. That means Peking duck tacos, and a complex take on bibimbap, called chashu bop, that comes sizzling in a stoneware bowl with crispy rice on the bottom. Sake, beer and wine are poured, and mixed into cocktails with Asian fruits. The white brick restaurant is simply furnished, with high and low dark wood tables and effective lighting.

Photographed from 1989-90, Kitchen Table earned labels like career-making and is considered the moment when Weems, 62  who has received the MacArthur genius grant and U.S. Department of States Medal of Arts  found her artistic voice. Institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have exhibited part of, or the entirety of, the 20 photos and 14 text panels during the last three decades. But, despite the series significance, and its total adaptability, it hadnt been published on its own  until now. The idea came about when the graphic designer Takaaki Matsumoto approached Weems several years ago. Kitchen Table has been printed many times, but never as a stand-alone book, she says. This is the first time that anyone has asked to focus on the series as its own entity. I am grateful to him for both designing and publishing the work, because it needed to stand on its own.",2016-04-05T21:13:20+0000

Stone-paved and glass-roofed, the pedestrian arcade opened in 1799 and has housed stationery stores, printers and specialty shops ever since. In 2007, the serial restaurateur Pierre Jancou put it on the map as an innovative food destination when he opened the still hugely popular Racines bistrot  vins there. At the time, Racines was one of the first tables to champion la bistronomie, as produce-driven contemporary French bistro cooking has come to be known, and was an early proponent of organic and vins nature, or unsulfured wines. The Passage des Panoramas is a beautiful space with a very particular atmosphere. Its also sort of an intimate time capsule, says Jancou, who is well-known for bringing new life to forgotten corners of the city.

us,These Two Guys Are Changing How We Think About Fashion,"RULE-BREAKING IS A PHRASE thrown around in fashion a lot. But who makes these rules? And arent rules what fashion is based on? After all, fashion isnt just the clothes on your back. Its the form of those clothes at a given moment, adhering to certain codes that define them as forward-thinking, as now, as  la mode. Which often, as on a menu, translates simplistically to a lump of something fancy plopped on top of an existing offering, as opposed to tinkering about with the guts or really changing anything. Rules in fashion are made by the industry: the editors, the designers, the corporations who fund the whole thing. And so, genuine rule-breakers dont come along that often. Fashion enjoys the status quo. It sells clothes, it makes money.",2016-04-11T09:28:23+0000

In the TV series, Mr. Williss character is played by Aaron Stanford, and he was put through quite a lot in Season 1, in several different time periods. The new season will include a story arc for Michael Hogan of Battlestar Galactica. In the first season, the writers wove a tale too complex to describe here, but Syfy has an droll primer video on the shows website.

And then there are his more sedate, minimal works that calmly reveal the purity of movement without all the bells and whistles. In Empty moves (Parts I, II & III), Ballet Preljocaj returns to the Joyce Theater to perform, for the first time in New York, all three sections of this spellbinding work, set to a recording of John Cages Empty Words from a 1977 performance in Milan. Not all those in that audience reacted well to Cages reading of Thoreaus journals; yet despite their insults and shouts, he carried on  just as the dancers do in Mr. Preljocajs hypnotic investigation of form. Here the dancers create a world of their own: quietly rigorous, sensuous in its constant flow and meditative. In other words, far from empty.

The bill sets standards for tracking plants, certifying physicians and licensing growers, dispensaries and physicians. Patients could take marijuana in pill, oil, vapor or liquid form but would not be able to legally obtain marijuana to smoke or to grow their own. The Pennsylvania Medical Society opposed the bill, and one opponent, Representative Matt Baker, warned that it violates federal drug laws and that the state would see a drastic impact on addiction and abuse. Meanwhile, in Ohio, lawmakers promised to legalize medical marijuana by the summer, before voters get a chance to decide a ballot question in the fall election. Pennsylvania would be the 24th state to legalize a comprehensive medical marijuana program, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (AP)",2016-04-13T23:28:45+0000

Their sexual chemistry has proved to be a cornerstone of their relationship providing a window into their loyalty for one another.

None of the waste appears to have escaped into the environment, the contractor, Washington River Protection Solutions, said. But workers were trying Monday to determine why the waste that leaked between the tank walls rose by about eight inches on Sunday, then dropped by half an inch. Hanford, near Richland, for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, including the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan. Workers are preparing to pump the waste back inside the tank. It is Hanfords oldest double-shell tank and since March was being emptied of its 750,000 gallons of radioactive waste because of the leak. Less than 100 gallons of waste was estimated to have leaked into the gap between the walls in recent years, drying in three separate patches.

This week, Lin-Manuel Mirandas Hamilton: The Revolution  written with Jeremy McCarter, its a look at Mirandas hit musical about Alexander Hamilton  enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No.1. At the same time, Ron Chernows 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton, which inspired the musical, is No.2 in its 27th week on the paperback list.

Peter and I have talked a lot about the strangeness of this political season, she replied. So many of the bizarre things that have happened raise questions about the fundamental nature of democracy in the United States. Could this have been our destination all along?

us,Sports Detectives Tracks Down Famed Memorabilia,"Fans who gorge on TV coverage of the National Football League draft can turn to the Smithsonian Channel for a digestif on Sunday, May 1: a football-themed episode of a new series called Sports Detectives. Each installment tries to track down or determine the authenticity of sports memorabilia, and here the objects in question are the 1964 championship ring that belonged to the Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and the football that ricocheted into the arms of the Pittsburgh Steelers Franco Harris in the 1972 play known as the Immaculate Reception. The findings by the detectives  Lauren Gardner, a sports reporter, and Kevin Barrows, a private investigator  arent always definitive, but the fun is in the revisiting of these moments. (The series premiere on April 24 concerned the flag that draped the goalie Jim Craig after the United States hockey teams gold medal victory at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980.) And, especially in the segment on the ring, a story that involves a divorce and a possible burglary, the quests provide a window into the sometimes murky sports-memorabilia world.",2016-04-29T15:44:08+0000

A few years later, his Meem: A Story Ballet About the Internet was a hit on the art festival circuit, and this week the Guggenheim Museums Works & Process series presents his Battleground, which the institution commissioned. Mr. McNamara impishly calls the work a Cosplay-Battle-Ballet, referring to the performance art of costume play often associated with anime and manga. With sci-fi and fantasy in mind, he turns the museums intimate Peter B. Lewis Theater into the titular battleground, dividing it into three war zones, and musters nine dancers to serve in competing armies. The audience sits in the line of fire.

Its a safe bet that Austen herself enjoyed reading a great deal. But to view the quotation above as a kind of library motivational poster, a fawning slogan for literacy, would be to rob it of the arch comedy that always and everywhere makes Austen sparkle. Thats because the speaker here is petty Caroline Bingley, who in fact cares nothing for books and hopes merely to attract the studious Mr. Darcy. Needless to say, it doesnt work. (In the 2009 adaptation Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, by Seth Grahame-Smith, Darcy deflects her advance with this memorable reply: Spoken like one who has never known the ecstasy of holding a still-beating heart in her hand. But I think Austens original, in which he ignores her and silently keeps reading, is just as wicked.)",2016-04-29T17:32:01+0000
