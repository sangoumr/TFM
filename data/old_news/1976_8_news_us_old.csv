us,What's Doing in the LOIRE VALLEY,"THE SITE  Few regions in the world have assembled in a relatively small area so great a collection of architectural delights as the Loire River Valley south of Paris. During the Middle Ages the river was fortified with impressive town ramparts and crenellated castles. Then, by the time of the Rerjaissance of the 16th century, with a consolidation of territories, there was time for pleasure. The castles were enlarged and more attention was paid to decoration, exterior as well as interior, less to the thickness of walls and the width of moat. While the French kings enjoyed hunting and carousing in the benign valley, enhanced by excellent products of the soil (including, of course, wine), their courtiers were obliged to build their own castles and manors. The result is an extraordinary countryside dotted with castles. There are a score of famous castles, but another 100 or more scarcely known outside their own neighborhoodsnot to speak of the churches and fortified estates and fine old stone houses in villages and towns. There are any number of ways to visit the castle country: Detailed itineraries are available in guidebooks, and one is suggested below. But if you can afford the time, simply wander through the region, following a sign to a castle here, a church or monastery there and nearly everywherea vineyard free wine tasting.",1976-08-01T05:00:00+0000

He tries to say, with St. Paul, As I imitate Christ, imitate me. But, paradoxically, humanity both intrudes on and becomes the vehicle of this imitation. In literature and in life the weakness of the whisky priest or libidinous pastor can heighten the force of the sign, for here is Paul's shattered vessel of clay struggling to allow God to accomplish his will, once again, in the unexpected way.",1976-08-01T05:00:00+0000

It was not only the sensation of loss, although that was certainly part of it, but also of pride and curiosity. What a lot of history is contained in these two careers, and what a lot remains to be learned about them! The socalled photography boom had arrived in time to elevate them to a new celebrity in the world beyond the photographic community that had long esteemed them, but not soon enough to give us a really comprehensive account of their work. With photographers, as with poets, there is a tendency to judge them by often reprinted anthology pieces. There is a tendency, too, to attribute consistency to a body of work that may contain a significant diversity, if not outright contradictions.

They purchased weathered barn siding and beams to build not only the arbors but also a tool shed and an outdoor room equipped with both a bar and a hibachi.

us,Screen: 'Obsession':Mystery Film by Brian De Palma at Coronet,"For slightly more than half its running time, ""Obsession"" is an entertaining, romantic suspense film of slightly less than transcendental style, a movie conceived (but not executed) in the Hitchcock manner, scored by late Bernard Hermann with what sounds to be enough music to fill an average-sized cathedral and three movies.Brian De Palma, the director, and Paul Schrader, the writer, have made a mistake, I suspect, in allowing ""Obsession"" to be identified as an hommage to Hitchcock. It puts a needless strain upon them, and upon us, who thus come to expect something more complex, more terse and more stylish than the film they've made. To be blunt, ""Obsession"" is no ""Vertigo,"" Hitchcock's witty, sardonic study of obsession that did transcend its material, which wasn't all that bad to start with.The Schrader screenplay, based on an original story by Mr. Schrader and Mr. De Palma, is most effective when it's most romantic, and transparent when it attempts to be mysterious. Constructing a satisfying mystery is like trying to make up a crossword puzzle that works in three dimensions. One little point doesn't work and the whole thing has to be done over.Hitchcock's plot aren't always that perfect, but when they aren't he's perceptive enough to know it, and magician enough to distract our attention in a way that is even more satisfying than the identification of logic.The plot of ""Obsession"" is such that you'll probably have figured out the mystery very early. No amount of subsequent red herrings can build up one's interest to its original peak. Instead of rising, it goes gently downhill to its climax.The film, which opened yesterday at the Coronet, requires a lot of exposition to get going, and it's a measure of the movie that the exposition is more entertaining, more moving than most of the drama that follows.""Obsession"" is the story of an ambitious young New Orleans businessman, Michael Courtland (Cliff Robertson), who, in 1948, meets and marries the object of his dreams, Elizabeth (Genevieve Bujold), a pretty, chic young woman who shares his success. In 1959, after a party celebrating their 10th anniversary, Elizabeth and their daughter are kidnapped and, apparently, killed when a police-backed rescue attempt fails.The movie then cuts to 1975, when Michael, more successful than ever but obsessed by his guilt for having failed his wife and daughter, makes a business trip to Italy, where, in a church that had been a favorite of Elizabeth's, he meets a young Italian girl who is the image of his dead wife. Like the James Stewart character in ""Vertigo,"" Michael sets out to turn the Italian girl, Sandra (also Miss Bujold), into Elizabeth.Logic is not essential in a film of this sort, yet Sandra is such a sensible girl that one wonders how she can participate so wholeheartedly in this scheme of conscious self-deception. Another problem is a cosmetic one. The film, from opening credits until the end, covers almost 30 years, but Mr. Robertson, who otherwise gives one of his best performances, doesn't appear to grow older by a day. He looks serenely ageless in the eerie way of someone made up by a mortician.Miss Bujold, an extraordinarily intelligent actress as well as a beautiful one, also does not look her best, especially as the Italian girl. This is ironic since almost everything else in the film, shot in New Orleans and Florence by Vilmos Zsigmond, is seen through romanticizing eyes that deny all imperfections.There is another problem that is difficult to discuss without giving away the plot. I'll say only that I'm not at all sure whether the fate that eventually catches up to Michael is the result of his young-man-on-the-make stinginess or of plot details I didn't catch.Making his film debut in ""Obsession"" is John Lithgow, a fine New York actor, who plays Michael's best friend and business partner, a fellow of old New Orleans stock that represents the culture that Michael, and all others like him, are in the process of replacing.With ""Obsession"" Mr. De Palma is moving into the big time. He's a very talented director and one must be glad for him, though I still prefer those films he made on shoe-strings (""Greetings,"" ""Hi, Mom,"" ""Sisters""), when he didn't hesitate to give a Bronx cheer to the Establishment that he now aspires to join.The film has been rated PG. There is nothing terribly shocking by way of nudity, or rough language, but the kidnapping sequence might terrify small children.",1976-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,'Alpha Beta' Details Marital Agonies,"In a sense, it is not a movie. It is a filmed play and filmed plays are usually disastrous. The camera is a restless eye and its restlessness spreads like itching powder.""Alpha Beta,"" a contemporary British play about a working-class marriage, is particularly unlikely as a movie. Its two characters confine themselves to a tiny kitchen and living room and spend three acts mutilating each other with words.But the film, which opened yesterday at the Quad II and Thalia Theaters, in a triumph in chains. The constrictions are a form of discomfort akin to hard seats in a basement theaer. The pennedin camera, the talking heads, are insufficient, but it is a relative insufficiency, like that of an opera performed in concert version.If the singers are good enough, the expedient works. And Rachel Roberts and Albert Finney are so extraordinary as the husband and wife that they make ""Alpha,"" cinematic or not, a startling and wonderful experience.There is no real plot, only a theme. It is that the breakup of a marriage is not a way out, but a playing-out of a joint agony. Inevitable and murderous at the same time, each blow wounds assailant as well as victim.The passing of time is the dramatic device. ""Alpha's"" three acts, preserved in the film, take three stages of the breakup, each some five years apart.In the beginning it is five or six years into the marriage of Frank Elliot, a clerk in a produce-shipping company, and his wife, Nora. From the start, we know exactly where they are. Her hands move quickly, it is to be hoped, incompetently, pasting up hideous white wallpaper in their living room. He stands there stolidly sipping coffee, his incipient estrangement marked equally by his failure to offer her any assistance and to remove his raincoat. He is home from work, but the raincoat is unconscious evidence that he doesn't want to be.In this first act the despair is Frank's. He is trapped in their narrow life and as they bicker and recriminate he loathes himself for being unable to break out. In the second act he has made the break: They live together under an ""arrangement"" under which he is virtually a boarder, openly going out with other women. In the third act they are separated and he comes once a week to visit the children.The agony shifts back and forth. At the end of the first act, Frank, backed into the newly-wallpapered corner, howls at his entrapment. In the second act Frank plays at self-absorbed indifferences, Nora's outrage. Here it is Nora who howls, unable to bear having her husband physically present, but absent in every other sense.In the last act Nora sits like a stone as Frank, on his weekly visit, chatters compulsively and tidies up the slovenly mess that she has let the house become. The marriage is dead, but not the pain and as they talk there is a faint tenderness but no hope at all.""Alpha"" is unsparingly acute. It is also narrow. Nothing comes in or out the door except Frank E. A. Whitehead, the author, is isolating what may be a universal pain of marriage, but he leaves out the social context, the outside factors that may either help a marriage or destroy it move quickly. He also misses the fact that few people can be so searingly consistent in their suffering.It is the achievement of Miss Roberts and Mr. Finney to make ""Alpha"" more universal than it is. Mr. Finney is wrath, anguish, hesitancy and charm in one chunky, seedy package. Miss Roberts is even better: She makes classic tragedy out of this row-house misery. There is authentic pity and terror in the final silences that succeed her first-act flutterings and her second-act vituperation.""Alpha"" is a play forced onto the screen and we see the strain clearly. It didn't have to be a movie: It could, for example, be done quite naturally on television. But the fact is that ""Alpha,"" Miss Roberts and Mr. Finney are here as a movie and that is the only way they can be seen. And they should be seen.",1976-08-05T05:00:00+0000

And what would be the common goals fostering closer association between the United States, Japan and the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.)? Well, apart from trade, All three nations wish to bring stability to the region. Candidate Reagan develops the argument for fitting in with the presumed Chinese scheme of things: A broadened relationship could also serve to provide a barrier to Soviet expansionism. And he holds that, To take advantage of this Asian opportunity [as conveyed by the Chinese signals], we must regain credibility in Peking's eyes.

us,Film: Early Wertmuller,"Some authors tear up their juvenile work; others leave it for scholars. Lina Wertmller has become a fascinating though uneven movie maker, but the public resurrection of one of her first films, made 10 years ago, is probably a mistake.""Let's Talk About Men,"" which opened yesterday at Loews Tower East, consists of four vignettes linked for no apparent reason by a sequence dealing with the efforts of a man who has inadvertently locked himself out of his apartment  without clothesto get back in.The vignettes, cast in the form of comedy, all seek to demonstrate with underlying anger different ways in which men abuse women. In their mordancy, and in some of their particular touches, there are reflections of things that Miss Wertmller would do later.The recognition of these things is of some interest, but not enough to make most people pay money to winkle or pay them out of a collection that is three parts bad and one part mediocre.In the first item, a profiteering businessman whose kittenish wife is a kleptomaniac, suddenly decides to make use of her proclivity when his deals turn sour. In the second, an aging knife-thrower is too vain to heed the pleas of his wifewho is also his badly scarred targetto get a new pair of glasses. The results are predictable.In the third vignette, a husband's insistence on treating his wife as a cretin stirs her to mutiny. He puts down the mutinywhich takes the form of a complex murder plotand thus, to his intellectual and erotic satisfaction, proves himself right.The humor of the first vignette is thin and predictable; the grotesquerie of the knife-throwing and murder-plot vignette is leaden and trite. Nino Manfredi overacts the man's part in each of them.In the last story, Mr. Manfredi is a farmer who spends the day woolgathering with his cronies while his wifeand theirsdo all the work. At night he comes home drunk and pleased with himself and, despite her reluctance, insists on coupling with her. The man's wastrel existence and his brutal subjection of his wife are similiar material, but Miss Wertmller does it with some liveliness, and Mr. Manfredi's performance is reasonably convincing.An occasional line shows some of the strength that Miss Wertmller developed later. The notion of the knife-thrower hacking up his wife's anatomy bit by bit simply because one day he has an extra drink, another day he decides to use his left hand, and so on, is grandly horrifying. Badly acted and poorly directed, it is no more than weird. In the first vignette there is a telling monologue by the tycoon who tells his wife what it would be like to be poor. ""You will grow ugly, he says. ""You will grow a mustache.""The rating is PG. Possible reasons: two suggested but not demonstrated acts of sexual intercourse. One killing.",1976-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Survive!',"Whatever majesty of spiritforged of ennobled will, faith and intelligence amid death and fierce adversityenabled the survivors of an Andean airline crash four years ago to endure against all odds is nowhere to be found in ""Survive!"" which opened yesterday at Loews State and Loews Cine theaters.The makers of this movie might be forgiven had the inextinguishable essence of humanity and the wracking issue of a survival that depended upon cannibalism eluded their talents. Artists for centuries have foundered on great themes that exceeded their grasps.But in the case of ""Survive!"" which is based not upon Piers Paul Read's bestseller, ""Alive,"" but upon an account by Clay Blair Jr., nobody had aspirations beyond speed and commercialism. While the film based on Mr. Read's book is still to come, the suspicion is that its arrival will establish that ""Survive!"" has gotten here first with the least.Made in Mexico, ""Survive!"" is an irksomely dubbed film of rudimentary exposition with a sometimes tinny musical accompaniment, which attempts by aural flogging to accomplish what the script cannot: engage the intelligence or the emotions. The characters, most of them representing members of a college rugby team, are indistinguishable from one another by appearance or deed.Visually, there are unnecessary scenes of protruding viscera and the lancing of an infected leg. The first butchering of the dead extends beyond the time when its point has ben made. And later scenes, including a brief shot of a flayed corpse in the mountain snow, are wholly gratuitous.To say that ""Survive"" is a disasater movie is not to categorize it but to describe it.",1976-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Disney's 'Gus':Mule's Football Goals Aid Hopeless Team,"The great mass of Walt Disney movies over the last dozen years are like airline meals. To be fair, they are like airline meals served on airlines that still make a little effort, providing a piece of fresh fruit, a tube of mustard to adorn the edible cardboard.The point is that both Disney movies and tray lunches at 20,000 feet have one thing in common. They are not experienced, at least by adults, for their own sake. Nobody, trying to pick a lunch spot, flies to London for the sake of the in-flight pressed meat or even the apple. Very few sane adults would go see even a decently average Disney film such as ""Gus"" unless they needed to build up moral leverage with an underage domestic pressure group.""Gus,"" which opened yesterday at the Kips Bay, Festival and other theaters, is about a ludicrously incompetent football team. Some of the incompetencies, such as a pass receiver who looks the other way when the ball finally arrives, are pretty funny. Finally, the team owner hires a Yugoslav mule and its Yugoslav handler.The mule kicks field goals unerringly and the team gets to the Superbowl on the basis of field goals. This makes a man who has bet against the team very unhappy and he hires two criminals to get in the way. They get the mule drunk and kidnap first the mule handler and then the mule itself. It will destroy no potential spectator's sense of suspense to say that they fail.As I say, this is a decently average Disney film, with a few funny parts and other parts where you would agree to smile if you could. Where the movie tries the hardest, it fails the most, as in a terribly long and trite comedy sequence in a supermarket.There is a good performance by Edward Asner as the sulphuric team owner and a very good one by Don Knotts as his shrivelled chief coach.",1976-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: An Unfunny Thing Happened to 'The Ritz',"WHEN TERRENCE McNally's. ""The Ritz,"" opened on Broadway early last year, the critics and public liked it well enough to give it more than a year's run. It was a farce that laid claim to roughly the same patch of mania the Marx Brothers used to tear up: a scramble of mistaken identities, non sequiturs and people not so much in the wrong beds as under them.It was hung upon a gimmicka man takes refuge from his murderous brother-in-law inside a bathhouse full of homosexuals in full orgyand the gimmick was the occasion for most of the jokes. As a farce though, despite the bumps and caperings, it had an essentially abstract spirit. It didn't dwell on the homosexuality, either the sentiment or the mechanics, any more than a sex farce actually dwells on sex.In making a movie out of ""The Ritz,"" Mr. McNally and his director, Richard Lester, have succumbed to the failing that has tended to go with screen adaptations of stage comedies ever since the 1930's, when they knew how to do such things. The bubbles don't disappear; on the contrary, they refuse to disappear as proper bubbles should. They are plotted, fixed, sprayed with lacquer.Still, there are a lot of funny jokes. Most of the principal performers are the same as in the Broadway show, and they are at least serviceably amusing. Rita Moreno, as the female singing star at the bathhouse Saturday night entertainments, is comically incandescent. ""The Ritz,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema I, might have been a cheerfully lumpy affair. A fallen souffl can still taste reasonably good, especially if you're hungry and eat it with bread.And in this sense it does work to some degree. But if the farce suffers mainly from wearing lead shoes, the homosexual gimmick suffers from something more serious.To have a tolerance, or even an acceptance of homosexuality doesn't rule out having an underlying physical distaste for it. Inevitably perhaps, the camera emphasizes the physical element far more than it was emphasized on the stage. To put it bluntly, it shoves up too closefor most of us, I thinktoo much pale flesh organized around unshared intentions. There are simply too many male homosexual stomachs, arms and faces at too short a range.It spoils the picture. But it is only fair to point out a number of good things that remain in it. There are, as I have said, the jokes. The lineup of weird characters checking into the baths, the fugitive son-in-law among them, is lively and amusing. I particularly like the son-in-law's assumptionhe is from out of townthat at such a sleazy establishment he can pay by check. And the fact thatas tends to happen in New Yorksuch an outrageous assumption works.The acting is often more energetic than funny; particularly in the case of Jack Weston as the fat, puffing son-in-law. On the other hand, Treat Williams is good as a shrill-voiced detective, and F. Murray Abraham manages some comic depth as one of the bathhouse regulars.",1976-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Futureworld':Science-Fiction Robots in Dominant Roles,"""Futureworld"" is a film about robots and, evidently, for robots. It is as much fun as running barefoot through Astroturf.A sequel to ""Westworld,"" the film once again deals with a skeptical reporter who uncovers dirty doings in a great pleasure garden of the future known as Dlos.If they pay a great deal of money, people can go to Delos (by Laker Airways, apparentlya dubious plug in view of what eventually happens there) and live a fantasy life in one of its sections. These are devoted respectively to recreating the Old West, the Middle Ages and space travel. Robots looking exactly like real people provide a variety of services: sex, for instance, or convincing-looking Indians or knights for the clients to kill.In the earlier film the reporter discovered that some defect in circuitry was causing the robots to kill the customers. In ""Futureworld,"" which opened yesterday at showcase theaters, the same reporter, Chuck Browning, goes back and discovers something far worse: a plot to use the facilities of Delos to get control of all the important people in the world.Browning and his sidekick, Tracy Ballard, go to Delos, accompanied by a planeload of important prospective victims: a Russian general, an Arab sheik, an influential Japanese. The latter plunge into the fun  the Russian imagines himself a czarist general, the Japanese, a knight-in-armor-with-camerawhile Browning and Ballard investigate the plumbing.After lots of running and hot-breathed pursuit the pair discover what the viewer discovered at least a half-hour earlier: that all these world-leader types are being killed and look-alike robots are being returned in their place. This, as one scientist explains, allows them to be operated by remote-control in the interests of world peace and reason.It is all the most ordinary kind of hardware science fiction, full of computers and empty of thought. It features miles and miles of tubes and pipes and valves and as Tracywho otherwise mostly says ""Let's get out of here""intelligently observes: ""It is about as exciting as a visit to the waterworks.""As the manager of the place, Arthur Hill mugs sleek villainy. Blythe Danner, as Tracy, and Peter Fonda as Chuck have absolutely nothing to do. Starring in ""Futureworld"" must be the actor's equivalent of going on welfare.The film is rated PG. Parents are advised that there is nothing offensive in it. Offensiveness would help.",1976-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,'Billy Joe' Leaps From Southern Romance to Dirge:The Cast,"""Ode to Billy Joe"" is a movie to lament. Its authors have ruined it. To say so is praise as well as regret. You ???can only ???ruin something that has some quality to begin with, and for more than half ??? ???length this Southern country romance has a quite individual kind of life and ???shrewdness.This first part also has its flaws. Sometimes it is cute where it's supposed to be funny, and sometimes it is soft where it's supposed to be lush. It is too heavily apparent that the director is pleased with what he's doing, and his breath all but fogs the camera. But he has some reason to be pleased, if only he would step back a little. Instead, after an hour or so, he steps forward, grabs his movie with both hands and sinks it.A decade ago the singer Bobby Gentry brought out a song about a Mississippi De???a bo??? called Billy Joe ???McAllister who jumped off a Tallahatch???e River bridge and died. The song was oblique: It didn't say why he jumped. It ???hinted at but didn't specify a relationship between Billy Joe and the g??? singer/protagonist. Tens of thousands teen-agers sta???ed up late arguing the gaps.Max Baer, the director, has extended the song into a two-hour film. Its virtue lies in the setting-out of the two characters  Billy Joe and a girl named Bobbytheir timid and then more demanding courtship, the families, the rural background. Its failure comes when Mr. Baer tries to stuff these two, with all their liveliness and appeal, into the song, and invents an answer to the mystery that is grotesquely out of keeping with the life he has established up to then.The story develops in a perfectly familiar and conventional way. Bobby is the daughter of a hard-working cotton farmer, a strict, religious man saved from dourness by a wary charm and a ghost of humor. These lea???ening characteristics save him from ???being simply a stock figure. Here, as in other places, the writing is ???partly responsible, and so is the impressive acting of the character, played by Sandy McPeak.Bobby is courted by a neighbor boy, an eager, grandiloquent, charming youth who seems to sprout in all directions at once ""He keeps popping up and introducing himself,"" Bobby's father complains, and at another point, when Billy Joe has come up after church in touching finerya ginger suit and white shoes, ""they look like he's been kicking vanilla ice cream"".The young people are tormented by their pull toward each other. Again, Mr. Baer's writing and the ability of the two actors make it something more than a sentimental clich. There is an apt balancing of love and lust.The two collide with each other, with the grownups around them, with the traditions of their setting. The setting is splendidly done at times, overdone at others Mr???. Baer and his cameraman have captured heat, the sheen of perspiration on the skin, the oppressive greenery, the blue-black stormclouds of the Delta country. They work dramatically as well as pictorially.This first part develops with an attractive balance of humor, sympathy and perceptive characterization, marred but not invalidated by sentimentality and excessiveness. Glynnis O'Connor, as long as the lines allow, is rebellious, thoughtful and funny as Bobby. Robby Benson, playing Billy Joe, manages his boisterous, wooly-headed role with great charm.But Mr.Baer wants to get the song in, and so Billy Joe has to jump off the bridge. The reason given for his doing so is, as I say, totally arbitrary and without any logical or emotional relation to what has gone before. It drains all the momentum from the film and turns it into ridiculous melodrama.And after all this comes a long, fatuous epilogue in which Bobby explains that she will keep the real reason for Billy's jump a secret, so as not to spoil the legend. What legend? He has only just finished drowning. The movie drowned some time earlier.The movie is rated PG Some of the scenes between the lovers are explicit, though emotionally rather than physically. In addition, the rating may rest on the discussion of the particular sexual problem that led to Billy ???Joe's jump.",1976-08-19T05:00:00+0000

Others, like the St. Louis Cardinals, experimented. The Cardinals, who were the first to schedule doubleheaders for most Sundays, blanketed the countryside around St. Louis with radio coverage of weekday games and cut off the broadcasts on Sunday. Just as the National Football League would build up attendance in later years by televising road games and blacking out the games at home, the Cardinals' policy brought many thousands from surrounding areas into town on Sundays. When radio found it could sell playbyplay coverage to sponsors, it agreed to buy its way into the parks, and a judicious application of cash helped allay the owners' fears.

The de rigueur formula relies on garish overdecoration with a confusion of natural wood paneling, mirrors, round (bagelshaped?) windows, a flood of sunshineyellow lighting, and, most of all, beautiful green plants suspended from the ceiling in slings of jute or macrame, preferably with bushytailed tassels hanging down to brush against the heads and brows of passersby. Add to this an assortment of real and fake junk antiques, and a crowded, sloppy selfservice cafeteria counter, and the formula for success is complete. The model for these bagel boutiques is Bagel Nosh, a chain with five companyowned restaurants in Manhattan, several more companyowned as well as franchised in local sub urbs and still others in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Colorado and California, with the newest addition opened in Philadelphia last week.
