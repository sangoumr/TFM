But since 2019s HBO hit Watchmen, only one of these massacres has become a cultural shorthand: the Tulsa massacre of 1921, in which thousands of white people stormed the citys Greenwood district and burned it to the ground, killing an estimated 300 African Americans and leaving thousands homeless.

Molly may be the most devout Dickens reader I know, and in her review she zeros in on the ways Kingsolver and Dickens overlap: both of them exuberant writers of sprawling social novels with a strong political message and concern for the lower classes. Exhuming him is a way for her to make a claim of inheritance explicit at a time when teeming, boisterous, activist novels are unfashionable, Molly writes. It is an argument that this loss of prestige is unwarranted, impermanent, even benighted, and it is a rebuttal of the notion that ideologues cant make great novelists, or that novels are no longer plausible vehicles for social change.",2022-11-03T20:43:35+0000

American teens still drive around with their nascent licenses, listening to questionable music, eating Pop-Tarts from gas stations (possibly, chillingly, the same Pop-Tarts).

us,Le Bernardin Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary,"In a business known for its short shelf life, a restaurant like Le Bernardin turning 50 is significant. The owners, Maguy Le Coze and the chef, Eric Ripert, have planned a dinner to mark the occasion. Ms. Le Coze and her brother, Gilbert, first opened their seafood restaurant in 1972 on the Left Bank in Paris, with a view of Notre Dame, then relocated the restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe. They made the trans-Atlantic move to the present location in New York in 1986, as an anchor in a collection of restaurants in a new office tower on Seventh Avenue. The restaurant received four stars in its first New York Times review, three months after opening, a top ranking it has maintained over decades. In Paris it received two stars from Michelin, but was never awarded the ultimate three. (Mr. Le Coze contended that it was because they only served fish.) When Michelin introduced its New York guide in 2005, the restaurant finally achieved the third star. It was a pinnacle that Mr. Le Coze was unable to enjoy: He died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1994. Ms. Le Coze kept the restaurant going with Mr. Ripert, who became her partner in the restaurant. To mark the anniversary they have organized a $1,000 per person six-course dinner on Wednesday with 10 percent going to the charity City Harvest, which Mr. Ripert supports. The menu combines echoes of Le Bernardin classics, like the pounded tuna first course; and monkfish with a sunchoke pure replacing melted leeks. (Mr. Le Coze is often credited with popularizing monkfish for the American audience.) In recent years, Le Bernardin has always been at or near the top of global restaurant awards.",2022-11-07T17:40:37+0000

So its still an appropriate home base for this venerable Paris brasserie, now with a global presence. Its managed by Groupe Barrire, whose hotels often house a Fouquets. Built into the Hotel Barrire Fouquets New York, the ground-floor brasserie is brightly elegant, done with Art Deco details, glittering chandeliers, red leather upholstery, brass trim and white tablecloths. Pierre Gagnaire, whose work at Saint-tienne in Paris has earned him three Michelin stars, is supervising the menu. The executive chef, Bradley Stellings, who worked with Alain Ducasse and his second-in-command, Didier Elena, said that Mr. Gagnaires signature, typically a refreshing touch of citrus, could be found in a number of traditional dishes, even the French onion soup. Count on oysters, escargots, caviar service, lobster fricassee, chicken paillard, a salmon casserole with Champagne, and, for dessert, the signature mille-feuille and profiteroles. Sharing the hotel lobby is Par Ici Cafe, for more casual Mediterranean fare in an indoor-outdoor setting with a garden. There are also several bars throughout. ",2022-11-08T17:44:31+0000

During the Muromachi period (1338-1573), the Japanese adopted the expression, which translates as mon-koh  or listening to incense  as incense developed into a codified art form with its own ceremony, known as koh-do. Sometimes koh-do is spiritual and sometimes its entertainment, a way to play with your senses, says Shinichiro Ogata, the Tokyo-based architect, designer, restaurateur and chef, speaking through a translator. This past April, convinced that a meditative state of mind is more necessary than ever in our double-time world, he brought koh-do to Ogata Paris, the three-floor Japanese restaurant, gallery and boutique he opened in the citys Marais neighborhood in 2020.",2022-11-11T14:00:09+0000

Its soft pompom tail shrunk to half its size like a melting snowball. The scratched plastic eyes deepened and grew wise; the left eye loosened and eventually fell off. When Noah first told me L.F.s name, I thought hed said Alef, like the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. I thought hed named it after an ancient scratch, the beginning of something that has, as far as we know, no end. The last time I remember seeing L.F., he was more story than bunny, more memory than animal: the well-loved thing knocked, and snipped, and cracked, and thinned enough for new light to shine through.

Ruspoli, who grew up visiting his grandmother in Morocco, quickly felt at home among the citys well-known expats  among them at the time the interior designer Bill Willis, the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berg  and soon purchased the popular French restaurant La Maison Arabe, transforming it into the medinas first riad hotel. But in the three decades since his arrival, says Ruspoli, Marrakesh has, for better and worse, grown along with the noise of scooters. So three years ago, he decided to sell the hotel to seek a quieter life about an hours drive outside of town in the Atlas Mountains. But not too quiet: This fall, Ruspoli and his longtime partner, Jos Abete, opened a new property, Olinto, in the lush Ouirgane Valley. Set on 10 acres planted with olive groves and fragrant gardens, the hotel has dramatic views of the red earth mountains, with nine vine-covered guesthouses with rooftop sitting areas, private gardens and, in some cases, pools. A spa will open sometime next year, but for now, guests can lounge on the many wisteria-lined terraces and enjoy massages in the traditional hammam. Ruspoli, who says he was born playing a piano, named his new project in honor of his like-minded ancestor Marquis Francesco Maria Ruspoli, a patron of Handel, who adopted the moniker Olinto, after a village in ancient Greece, as part of his membership in a musical and literary society called the Academy of Arcadia. My hope is to host something similar here: a retreat and, eventually, a small music festival surrounded by my gardens, he says. Rates start at $700 per night, olinto.net.",2022-11-21T12:00:08+0000

From the top of the gently sloped 6.3-acre lot, they would follow a wide brick path under a canopy of native chical and guayacn trees to its end at a solitary brick lintel hung with dangling ferns. Through the threshold, they would enter the first of the houses three courtyards, square enclosures staggered along a diagonal and sutured together by a brick canal, a furrow in the grounds otherwise flat pavers, and ending in a fountain. In the second patio, they would climb a staircase that spread to a roofscape of catwalks and barrel vaults, eventually descending to the final terrace and out again into the garden that Salmona and Madrin, now 67, had spent more than a decade planting before they laid the houses first brick. Only after circumambulating the 1,625-square-foot house, named Casa Ro Fro for the stream that bounds the property to the east, and only if his visitors insisted, would Salmona take them inside for a perfunctory tour of its monastic interiors: its two baths and three bedrooms, its kitchen and living room and studio, built in concrete, granadillo wood and, most of all, brick.",2022-11-22T12:00:20+0000

But before all of that, there was honey. The first thing Christiansen  the founder of the ad agency Chandelier Creative  did upon moving to his densely vegetated seven-acre property in Los Angeless Highland Park in 2016 was establish some beehives. As a child in rural Australia, he had been surrounded by his parents hives: Its just this timeless, beautiful thing that everyone can do, he says. Earlier this year, Christiansen installed hives in the gardens of a few famous friends and fans of Flamingo Estate, with all proceeds from the resulting honey sold this holiday season going to a number of charities, including Cancer for College and Refugees International. In southern Portugal, the artist Ai Weiweis bees are feasting on olive trees. Will Ferrell, Tiffany Haddish and LeBron and Savannah James have hives in different parts of Los Angeles, and Julianne Moore has been hosting hers in Montauk, on Long Island. These bees are like my children, so I only wanted them to go to the best places, Christiansen says. (His own swarm was used for the Los Angeles sites; elsewhere, he relied on trusted local apiarists.) Going forward, he plans to introduce his bees to other fabulous gardens. As he sees it, its a kind of vacation for these industrious insects. These bees wake up, he says, and they fly out to the most amazing view. From $250, flamingoestate.com.

us,A Tall Vase Inspired by Bodega Flower Stands,"The ceramist Reinaldo Sanguino became obsessed with clay as a boy in Caracas, Venezuela, where he would go down to the river and shape the mud with his hands. Now 49, he came to the United States in his 20s to study at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine for a summer and, after laboring for years on the trade show and art fair circuit, was discovered around 2012 by David Alhadeff, the founder of the New York City-based Future Perfect design gallery. Sanguino, who often starts with a simple hand-built or wheel-thrown clay form, makes stools, hanging wall pieces and tables, as well as monumental vessels, in his Long Island City, Queens, studio, then transforms the material with a glazing process to produce one-of-a-kind creations characterized by saturated shocks of colors, metallic glimmers and hints of oatmeal, with knotted or stitched-together pieces of fabric, yarn or burlap for texture. This two-foot-tall vase, which suggests an amphora, has craggy holes on the sides for branches or blossoms; unlike some art potters, he intends for most of his work, however precious, to be used. Im inspired by the rough beauty of bodega flower stands, which are staffed by immigrants, he says. The point is always to be real.

The wonderful thing about the loblolly, a forester named Alex Singleton told me this spring, peering out over the fringes of a tree farm in West Georgia, is that it grows fast and grows pretty much anywhere, including swamps  hence the non-Latin name for the tree, which comes from an antiquated term for mud pit.

Black attorneys make up less than 5 percent of all attorneys and continue to face horrific experiences in law school and in the legal community. This is whom I envisioned myself supporting when I registered for the program as a recent graduate. I imagined deep conversations about law professors and law-firm culture, and sharing how Ive learned to navigate them as a Black woman. Not only will these conversations not apply to my mentee the same way, but I cant help wondering if assisting them will ultimately contribute to my own oppression. There are so many factors in her favor that I dont really want to help give her even more of a leg up in my free time. On the other hand, I dont have anything against her, and law school is universally scary during the first year. Should I be thinking about this differently? Is it wrong to bow out?

He did, however, enjoy making things, working with his father to lash together a child-size crossbow from spare pieces of wood or sewing a pair of fingerless gloves in homage to Bad-era Michael Jackson. After completing his degree in industrial design at the Media and Design Academy in Genk and following a stint as a runway model for the fashion designer Raf Simons (who had also studied in Genk), Verheyden, now 44, began making handbags from a studio in his hometown. In 2007, he moved into a 1,600-square-foot townhouse in the center of the city with his wife, Saartje Vereecke, 46; together, they established a design firm under his namethat sells objects like precisely tailored leather place mats and minimalist furnishings such as solid oak stools.
