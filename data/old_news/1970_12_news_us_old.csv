I am thinking of plays by au thors such as JeanJacques Bernard, Henri di Monther lant or even perhaps Jean Anouilh. What those dis parate playwrights have in common is a love of conver sation for its own sake, and the gradual disclosure of the recesses of the heart.

us,'Adam at 6 A.M.' Sneers at Mid-America,"At one point in ""Adam at 6 A.M.,"" Adam Gaines (Michael Douglas), a supposedly hip, young, California college professor visiting some distant relatives in Missouri, is questioned about his movie preferences by a beer-guzzling cousin, who likes Julie Andrews movies. Adam looks pained. He prefers films such as ""Blow-Up."" The cousin scoffs, and the movie, which aspires to a superiority it never deserves, scoffs at the cousin. The movie knowsand assumes that we agreethat anyone who likes Antonioni must be all right, and that anyone who likes Julie Andrews is a card-carrying, right-wing, war-mongering, all-American jerk.This is, to say the least, rather simplistic logic. (As a matter of fact, I have a friend who can make quite a case in behalf of the metaphysical splendor of what he calls The Cinema of Julie Andrews.) It is, however, typical of ""Adam at 6 A.M.,"" a movie full of mid-cult opinions about the vacuity of mid-cult American life. It looks authentic (much of it was filmed in rural Missouri), but its value crises sound very much like those that people who live in Beverly Hills wish they could have if they weren't too busy making movies like this.The principal problem of the film is that, for the plot to work, Adam Gaines must be a bigger jerk than the people he, and the movie, put down. Tired of his superficial parents, his beautiful mistress and the perfunctory demands of his academic career, Adam goes back to his family roots in the Middle West, where he spends the summer working as a manual laborer on a land-clearing gang, close to what somebody describes, quite seriously, as ""God's own mud.""For a while Adam thinks he has found some answers, first from Harvey, a fellow crew member who works all day with his hands and stays up half the night studying to become a TV repairman. There is also Jerri Jo Hopper, the quintessential, small-town beauty queen, who makes very good apple pies and is superb in bed.Harvey, however, turns out to be a fraud, a spineless boozer and petty gambler, fated to spend his life migrating from one temporary job to another. Even more of a shock to Adam (although it's apparent to the audience from her first appearance) is the revelation that Jerri Jo dreams of a French provincial house in a suburb and will spend her life seeking truth in the pages of the Ladies' Home Journal.Perhaps if Adam had spent a little less time looking at movies like ""Blow-Up"" and a little more time watching Julie Andrews movies, or even television, he might not be quite as shocked as he is by what he finds in Middle America. But then, of course, there wouldn't be any movie.""Adam at 6 A.M."" is based on an original screenplay by Stephen and Elinor Karpf (their first) and is the first directorial effort of Robert Scheerer, who has directed some quite classy television specials, including Barbra Streisand's ""A Happening in Central Park."" The film, unfortunately, has the same kind of classy and (under these circumstances) fake looklots of zoom shots (backed by a loud rock score), traveling shots and images photographed either through glass or as reflections.The performances, however, are attractive. Mr. Douglas hasn't much to do but look bemused (as he drives his Porche) or pained (as he realizes everyone else's stupidity), but Joe Don Baker could win this year's Jack Nicholson award as the good-natured Harvey, and Lee Purcell is absolutely right, down to the slightest pout, as Jerri Joe, the kind of girl who doesn't think you should go all the way on a first date.""Adam at 6 A.M."" opened yesterday at the R.K.O. 59th Street Twin Theaters where, beginning at 11 A.M., the feature starts every hour, on the hour, in one of the two auditoriums.",1970-12-01T05:00:00+0000

It was exposed yesterday at the Embassy. But despite its dubbed-in English dialogue and its largely undraped dolls, this Italian import simply proves that surface sex, not the problem, really, is being purveyed here. Unfortunately it's not too rousing a gimmick, in view of all the explicit fare that's been exhibited hereabouts in the recent past.In essence, all the angst in ""The Seducers"" is generated by Maud de Belleroche, playing a Medusa-like, oil-rich matron with exotic sexual appetites, who has brought Maurizio Bonuglia, a hip, blond oprator; his wife, Rosalba Neri, and their equally free-swinging girl friend, Edwige Fenech, aboard her yacht to arouse the manly instincts of her 20-year-old son, Ruggero Miti, who still plays with his toy trains.Despite all the pairing off, there are complications, naturally, when a simple peasant girl, Ewa Aulin (she played the title role in ""Candy,"" it may be recalled) is enticed aboard from her island home to have a go at the son, who seems to admire her. And there's her loutish fisherman-husband, who fouls things up when he turns up seeking his missing wife and ends up being seduced and knocked off.Those plot convolutions are unimportant actually. The ladies, to be specific, as well as the men, may be uncomfortable with the rudimentary dialogue and the melodramatic problems, but they're photogenic and seem at ease with their sex simulations. It would not be ungallant to indicate that it all ends tragically, like an ancient Italian opera, with the confused, addled son dispatching mama and his girl friend. His I.Q. couldn't have been that low, considering all the disturbing improbabilities of ""The Seducers.""",1970-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Both are more closely related to the genus skin flick than to the austere practices of the American Nurses Association or original research in the medical sciences.In either case, the skin flick affliction is very mild and the possibility of contagion is slight. These seemingly serious dramatizations of the tribulations of their young men and women in white, filmed in fine color, only prove that the practitioners appear to have as many woes as their patients.""The Student Nurses,"" four of them to be exact, are as quick on romance as they are on stuy. Sharon goes for her young, terminal case; Priscilla for a freaky, LSD imbibing bike boy; Phred for an interne who even helps with an abortion for Priscilla, and Lynn, for her Mexican-American La Causa activist boy friend. Things are rough, obviously, for the ladies, who appear to win nothing but their graduation caps. ""Nothing stands still, I guess,"" Lynn says bravely, but it makes you wonder what kind of attention you'll get from these graduates when you're ill.Nothing stands still either for ""The Love Doctors,"" in this case Ann Jannin and Frank Mahalan, whose problems are to keep aiding and charting the sex responses of their disturbed volunteers and to thwart a puritan college regent who wants to stop their experiment. Among their volunters are a young widow and a man whose wife is an invalid; a lawyer whose wife thinks she's frigid, and a blonde whose older boy friend is neglecting her.Despite the brief exposures and simulated couplings, viewing their minimal reactions on closed circuit TV, and oscilloscopes, does little to raise the temperature or expand our mental horizons. A tragic climax that does, however, point to a happier future for the Human Heterosexual Laboratory,"" is of no help to ""The Love Doctors"" or their patients, who still need lots of acting, writing and directional care.",1970-12-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Portrayal of Cuba:Documentary Depicts Youth Role in Revolt,"""Compaeras and Compaeros,"" which opened yesterday at the New York Theater on a program with Luis Buuel's 44-minute masterpiece, ""Simon of the Desert,"" is a feature-length documentary on youth's participation in the Cuban revolution. It was produced, directed and edited by David C. Stone, Barbara Stone and Adolfas Mekas, and is the committed record of what Mr. and Mrs. Stone saw in Cuba between June and October, 1969.I suspect that one's reaction to the film will depend largely on the sentiments one brings into the theater. The Stones and their cameramen, including Robert Machover who photographed Robert Kramer's ""Ice"" and co-directed ""Troublemakers,"" are not at all interested in beguiling the senses by what I'm sure they would regard as cinematic superfluities. They believe so completely in the accomplishments of the revolution to date, and in its goals, that they waste no time trying to balance all the pros with even a few cons.This is their choice but, political considerations aside, it doesn't make for very compelling movie-watching. ""Compaeras and Compaeros"" consists mostly of interviews with young peoplesugarcane cutters, teachers, engineers and the liketalking about their jobs, the opportunities opened up for them by the revolution, and their commitments to its success.They are earnest and believable, but not terribly articulate (the Spanish dialogue is translated by English subtitles). In fact, in addition to ideals, they seem to share a collective vocabulary that is so small and austere that it would seem to do a disservice to the grandeur of the revolutionary dream, the goal of which must be humanism. There is one revealing sequence in which the young people of a collective meet to elect ""exemplary workers."" One girl is elected because she has ""determination,"" because she always surpasses her goals, and because she never fights with anyone. Another girl is blackballed because, although she works hard, she doesn't inspire trust and hasn't many friends. One's heart immediately goes to the loser, which explains, I think, why committed movies of this sort never convert the uncommitted. They more or less insist on abject acceptance of premises that cannot be debated.The quality of the color photography is generally fine and, except for one orangey sunset, resolutely refuses to deal in bourgeois postcard esthetics.",1970-12-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen::City Under Sea,"""Latitude Zero,"" a Japanese science-fiction movie, and ""Day of Anger,"" an Italian Western, were released yesterday as a double bill at neighborhood theaters.Latitude Zero is a secret city under the sea where all the men are great scientists, all the women are knockouts in plastic mini-dresses, and everybody does good. To balance so much good there must be evil. The center of evil is another secret city, ruled over by one Malic (Cesar Romero) and his consort (Patricia Medina), who practice mad medicine and drink endless quantities of what looks like lime Kool-Aid out of martini glasses.The actual story of ""Latitude Zero"" concerns a submarine expedition to rescue yet another great scientist whom Malic has captured and intends, by a bit of insane surgery, to add to his quite remarkably cuddly collection of intelligent monsters  which includes spastic bats, giant red-eyed rats and a super-scale griffin.The story, however, is the weakest element in ""Latitude Zero."" The real virtue of the film lies in its charming and careful models, its ingenious special effects, its fruity interior dcor, its elaborate network of television screens (nobody sees anything first-hand if he can watch it on TV instead) and in Dr. Anne Barton.Dr. Barton (Linda Haynes), all well-washed, pug-nosed beautiful blondness, is not so much a character as the perpetuation of an archetype. Merely repeating the hygienic syllables of her name should recall at least one generation of science-fiction addicts to the deepest sources of their delight.For ""Day of Anger"" there is not much good to say. It is a strange and muddled film, very long and mostly boring, depending for its plot upon notions of class and caste that seem foreign to the genre if not to real history.But I think attention should be paid to the doctor and the banker and the barber (I have no cast identifications and that whole collection of mostly villainous secondary characters who in Italian Westerns provide a quality of fastidious short fatness to oppose the general long leanness of the old frontier.",1970-12-05T05:00:00+0000

Like ""Faces,"" which was rambling and funny and accurate, and which I admired, the new film demonstrates a concern for panicky, inarticulate squares that is so unpatronizing that it comes close to being reverential in a solemnly religious sense.""Husbands,"" however, also puts one's tolerance of simulated cinma vrit to the test. It is almost unbearably long. It is a narrative film without any real narrative, and although it is a movie about three characters, those characters are seen almost exclusively in terms of their limiting relationship. It's as if someone decided to photograph a tug-of-war and photographed only the rope between the contestants.Gus (Cassavetes), Harry (Ben Gazzara) and Archie (Peter Falk), commuting cronies from Port Washington, L. I., meet at the funeral of the fourth member of their group, a man taken off before his time by a coronary. They are shaken up, not only by the loss of their friend and the awareness that it could have happened to any one of them, but also by their own survival into imminent middle age, that dreadful time when it is suddenly apparent that what is, probably is the way it's always going to be. Archie would have liked to be a professional athlete ""You get sweaty and feel good and you're with guys you like.""In a four-day bender that follows the funeral. Gus and Harry and Archie start drinking and talking in New York and wind up in London, where they drink and talk some more and make out with three unusually attractive pick-ups. They continue to drink and talk and, finally, come to the end of a very expensive weekend. Archie would like to stay on, but Gus points out that among them they have ""three garages, five kids and two lovely wives."" The only problem, he adds bleakly, ""is going home and making love to them.""""Husbands"" seems not only to be about friendship, but also a product of friendshipthat of the three stars who react to one another with an extraordinary intensity that seldom is as meaningful to us as it is to them. As the movie rolls on, through scenes of epic non-communication, including one extended interlude in a men's room where Gus and Archie take turns vomiting up a night's worth of beer, a kind of frustration settles over the movie, like that experienced by the three friends.Harry beats up a telephone booth and then turns to his friends and admits that although his wife is good in bed, he loves Gus and Archie more. Archie almost ruins his night out in London when he recoils in horror to the open-mouth kiss offered by his girl. In Port Washington, that sort of thing is frowned upon, at least between strangers. They are frustrated not only by the dim present, but also by attitudes established in the past.The movie, in turn, becomes frustrated by the form chosen by Mr. Cassavetes. He lets every scene continue long past closing time, as if in hopes of grabbing, perhaps accidently, some found truth. The effect of ""Husbands"" eventually is like that of being at a party, after the liquor and wit have run out, and when nobody can quite bring himself to leave.With the exception of Harry, who is seen briefly in very funny, uproarious battle with his Wife (""I'm just not comfortable in front of you,"" she tells him, adding ""it's nothing personal""), Mr. Cassavetes doesn't let us see the men except as a team, as effectively isolated from wives and family as Arctic explorers. This explains, I think, the sudden relief and effectiveness of a closing scene in which Gus returns home, where he is met by his 11-year-old son and his 2-year-old daughter who, for no visible reason, bursts into tears. It may not be the only spontaneous moment in ""Husbands,"" but it is tender and sad, and it affected me more than anything else in the film.It affected me, I suspect, because like Gus, I was exhausted by the manic horse-play with which the husbands react to one another, and which is the ritual that represents the exchange of their love. Gus and Harry and Archie cuff one another a lot, and, when drunk, they are given to sloppy kisses. When they swim, they dunk one another under the water, and when it's all over, they are tired, but not much wiserwhich is pretty much the sum and substance of ""Husbands.""",1970-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A War Mission:Rock Hudson Starred in 'Hornet's Nest',"Phil Karlson's ""Hornet's Nest,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and neighborhood theaters, pits Rock Hudson along with 15 young boys against a significant portion of the Nazi forces occupying Italy in 1944. Rock Hudson wins, and thereby saves not only himself and the boys but also Sylva Koscina, a German army doctor who proves her goodness by shooting fellow Germans when the chips are down, and Sergio Fantoni, a German captain who proves his goodness by a) hating the SS, b) admiring Rock Hudsons military genius and c) evidencing a kind of sly fondness for the boys, who are rapidly cutting his troops to ribbons.The importance of Hudson's mission (he has been parachuted behind the German lines in order to blow up a dam) is never really made opaque, let alone clear. And this is merely one of so many faults on almost every level you can imagine, that I could understand anybody's temptation to dismiss ""Hornet's Nest"" as a bad movie that does not even satisfy its own fairly modest ambitions.A bad movie, perhaps, but interesting enough in its characters (though always faintly ridiculous in its actions) and with a sufficiently complex performance from Rock Hudson to merit attention and some respect.Although Miss Koscina trails along for, I guess, sexual as well as medical purposes, and although Hudson has at her in one very perfunctory rape, the real interest in ""Hornets' Nest"" has to do with the antagonism, acceptance and, ultimately, love that passes between Hudson and the boys  especially their leader, Mark Colleano.The Phil Karlson movies I most admireout of a long and active career these include ""The Phenix City Story"" (1954), ""The Brothers Rico"" (1957), ""Hell to Eternity"" (1960)are strong in their understanding of male relationships that in some cases are also family relationships.If ""Hornets"" Nest' is about anything, it is about such relationshipsin effect, about the difficult and uneasy bringing together of a father and a son. And on this level, as opposed to all other levels, the film is alive and responsive to the emotional potential of its dramatic progress.Christmas is coming, at least at the neighborhood showcases, some of which unveiled ""Horror House"" yesterday. This atrocious hack-'em-up bundle from Britain involves a group of young Carnaby Street parasites in the mysterious butchery of a haunted mansion outside London. The young swingers actually get outswung by a glistening butcher knife.""Teddibly noisy in hyah,"" murmurs one of them, shortly before getting a seasonal carving.Customers at the New Amsterdam on West 42d Street weren't spared after The End. In a pell-mell rush came three successive previews of coming attractions, retaining the spirit. First we saw a sailor quartering crewmen with an axe. Next was a peek at a goody about the transplanting of living human heads.In the third tantalizer, mother was a vampire, bidding her son farewell with a tender chomp on the neck.

us,Film: Costa-Gavras Depicts a Believer's Betrayal by His Belief:Montand and Signoret Star in 'Confession' Other Movies Arrive on Local Screens,"Costa-Gavras's ""The Confession,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, is not, I think, a better movie than his prize-winning ""Z,"" with which it will inevitably be compared, not only by the critics but also by those members of the public who may look for a repeat performance. The earlier film was a nearly perfect topical thriller whose form pretty much defined the substance of its liberal politics.However, because the subject of ""The Confession"" is much more complex, much more human, I find it vastly more interesting than ""Z,"" even when one is aware of the way Costa-Gavras manipulates attention by the use of flashy cinematic devices that sometimes substitute for sustained drama. It is a horror story of the mind told almost entirely in factual and physical terms, which is something of a contradiction.These are, however, the terms of which Costa-Gavras is a movie master, and in which Artur London originally wrote his book, adapted for the screen by Jorge Semprun, who also wrote the script for ""Z.""""The Confession"" is the real-life story of Artur London, a loyal Communist who certified his credentials by serving with the International Brigade in Spain and with the Communist anti-Nazi underground in France, and by a long term in a Nazi concentration camp. In 1949, Mr. London returned to his native Czechoslovakia from France to become Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the Communist Government of President Klement Gottwald. Two years later, along with 13 other leading Czech Communists (11 of whom were Jewish), Mr. London was arrested for treason and espionage and found guilty in what became known as .the ""Slansky trial.""The Slansky trial, named for the secretary general of the Czech Communist party, who was also a defendant, was one of the last major gasps of the Stalinist purges that began with the Moscow trials in the 1930's. All of the Slansky defendants were found guilty and all but three, including Mr. London, were executed.Mr. London lived not only to see the defendants rehabilitated and to write his book but also to return to Czechoslovakia on the day in August, 1968, when Soviet troops invaded his country to end the short Czech spring.""The Confession,"" with Yves Montand playing Mr. London and Simone Signoret his wife Lise, is the story of a believer's ultimate betrayal by his belief, of intolerable physical torture and psychological harassment (London is urged to confess to crimes he did not commit to prove his loyalty to the party), and, finally, of survival.It is a harrowing film of intellectual and emotional anguish, dramatized by the breathless devices of melodrama. Costa-Gavras employs abrupt jump cuts and flashes forward as well as back. He underscores the desperation of the meeting of some hunted men in a private apartment with the sounds of children roughhousing in the next room. It may, in fact, be one of the most aurally resonant movies I've ever seen. It is full of ordinary sounds made somehow ominous, like the slamming of doors (car, house, prison) and footsteps (on wood, brick, concrete).Its color photography by Raoul Coutard is also fine (natural overhead light in all the interiors), even when resorting to the zoom, which can be a legitimate tool in melodrama. Beginning with Mr. Montand and Miss Signoret, it is perfectly cast. One really responds to the faces, the attitudes and gestures in a Costa-Gavras film, as when, during the trial, the trousers of one of the emaciated defendants fall to the floor and he turns to the court with an expression of hopeless, perfectly confused laughter and despair.""The Confession"" is a film of movement and sensation, as was ""Z,"" but there is at its center a complex human being. Like the book, it is an anti-Stalinist rather than anti-Communist polemic (Mr. London has written that he is interested in putting ""a human face"" on national socialism). One tends to forget the context, of the Londons' experiencethe totality of a belief that would prompt a wife to denounce a husband that she has loved for almost 20 years, simply because the Party had to be right.You might not know it from the film, but the Londons are different from you and meand from Arthur Koestler, whose disenchantment came earlier (1937) and was more complete. In a recent interview, Mr. Koestler recalled the blind party discipline that he eventually denied as he quoted Andr Malraux: ""A life is worth nothing, but nothing is worth a life."" Because this is also the essence of ""The Confession,"" I liked it very much, even when its form is in combat with its substance.",1970-12-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Frisby's 'There's a Girl in My Soup' Opens:Miss Hawn and Sellers Take Leading Roles Adaptation Is Directed by Roy Boulting,"In adapting his bad play for the screen, Terence Frisby has slightly opened up the action and dirtied down the situations of ""There's a Girl in My Soup""but otherwise he has left everything needlessly intact. By way of opening up he has added a scenic vacation in Southern France that would hardly satisfy Gidget goes to the Riviera. And by way of dirtying down he has, for example, changed things so that his hero, who in the play began by not managing to seduce a former girl friend about to be engaged, in the film begins by successfully seducing a former girl friend who has just been married.The hero, Robert Danvers (Peter Sellers), is a kind of cantering London gourmet, famous from magazine articles and television programs, whose lecherous middle age is threatened even to the point of matrimony when he temporarily beds and boards a young wild bird (Goldie Hawn) who can out-calculate the master in the strategies of love. Nothing much comes from this encounter (it is important for theater at this level that it titillate the tired libido and lay it reassuringly to rest at the same time) but the passing of three acts on stage or 95 minutes in the movieswithout illumination or wit or good humor or good sense.But what seems to have bothered nobody in the theater becomes offensive on film  partly by design, in additional dialogue devoted mostly to stupid not-quite-double-entendres, and partly by the very fortunate accident that the compulsions of even the most commercial cinema are generally more demanding than those of Broadway or the West End.Even the most commercial cinema should do better than Roy Boulting's direction, which is not so much direction as the piecing together of shots and reaction shots in a mechanical imitation of liveliness. Like almost everything else in ""There's a Girl in My Soup,"" it is competent, but competent to no purpose.The only performance to praise is that of Tony Britton, who, as Danvers's very much married publisher and friend, achieves a level of sophisticated pleasantness that actually, suggests comedy. Peter Sellers, on the other hand, is at his least inventive. And Goldie Hawn, who I think might be fun in another part, mostly indulges in bad habits with her too-expressive eyes. In fairness, both Miss Hawn and Mr. Sellers are handicapped by roles in which any attempt at a characterization must seem an imposition.""There's a Girl in My Soup"" opened yesterday at the Astor and Loew's Orpheum theaters.The real worth and the power of ""Skezag,"" a 73-minute documentary conversation with a young derelict who has initially experimented with hard drugs, comes across only at the end in a shattering postscript. Instead of the cheerfully cynical young man who has been babbling nonstop through a rather surface case history of despair, we now see a glassy-eyed, hoarse-voiced human wreck. Strapping his arm and injecting the needle, he demonstrates, his eyes looking at us and telling the whole, terrible story.In principle, the Whitney Museum is to be commended for opening its showcase to independent filmmakers with stark realism on a vital subject of today. The programs will change weekly, with the museum's entrance fee of $1 covering the auditorium screenings.Commendable, too, is the informal way the two directors, Joel L. Freedman and Philip F. Messina, have set up their color camera for a give-and-take conversation with their subject, who is soon joined in the film by two other young men, both addicts. They swap case histories, they philosophize and they argue fiercely.Most admirable of all is the baring of his thoughts by young Wayne Shirley, the main speaker, as he courageously, often blithely, recounts his life for the camera.It is not, unfortunately, the baring of a soul. The recollections are sketchy, often hazy, the sound track is occasionally garbled, and pertinent background data wrestles with a relentless flow of obscenity. Add to this a monotonous clobbering of the expression, ""ya know."" The final five minutes says it all.",1970-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Circuit Houses Get 'Take a Girl Like You':Amis Novel Made Into a Kind of Comedy Four Other Pictures Begin Their Runs,"""Take a Girl Like You,"" based on Kingsley Amis's 1960 novel, is about Jennifer Bunn, a pretty, 20-year-old school teacher who is determined to remain a virgin until her marriage, although not because of any religious or moral principles. Jenny Bunn is possessed by a mystique that is essentially feminine, and as incapable of being superficially analyzed as that which drives the mountain climber to new heights of ridiculously sublime and sometimes fatal endeavor. She protects her virginity because it's there. Or, as she puts it, because ""It's all I have to give.""This is a satisfactory answer neither for Patrick (Oliver Reed), the wolf who pursues and falls in love with her; for Jenny (Hayley Mills), who finally loses what is referred to as ""it"" in bleak but not really traumatic circumstances, nor for us, who begin to suspect that Jenny has problems that are beyond the range and interest of this sort of mild social satire.I must say that I felt much the same way about the Jenny described in Mr. Amis's novel, which has an essentially comic form but is never very funny.The film, like the book, is set in a middle-sized town, not too far from London, and sees Jenny as a symbol of the new middle class, which has been educated beyond its social and economic status and doesn't quite know how to behave in its new freedom. Jenny, who seems to have everything going for her, including a warm natureshe's ""a good kisser""intelligence and looks, is both unwilling and unable to exercise her sexual liberation.""Take a Girl Like You,"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters with ""The Mind of Mr. Soames"" (reviewed earlier). It is the first theatrical film to be directed by Jonathan Miller, the young British physician turned actor (""Beyond the Fringe"") and stage director. Considering Mr. Miller's reputation as an innovator with Britain's National Theater, ""Take a Girl Like You"" is only conventionally surprising.That is, it is surprising in terms of the revelations of the plot, which has been changed in at least one major detail in the screenplay by George Melly, rather than in terms of content and style, which might be described as color-coordinated kitchen-sink. The mostly drab milieu has been photographed in bright, cheeky color and there is, behind the opening and closing credits, the inevitable rock title tune.With one notable exception, however, Mr. Miller has obtained excellent performances from his cast, including Mr. Reed; Noel Harrison, as an exurban sybarite who dreams of ""lots and lots of lovely sex forever""; and Sheila Hancock and John Bird, as the perfectly mismated couple who run Jenny's boarding house.Miss Mills is an extraordinarily pretty girl, but the once spontaneous attitudes and gestures of the child actress have become cold and calculating in the adult star. Her Jenny is as vulnerable as a Hollywood press agentwhich tends to divert one's sympathies, not only from her, but from the movie that takes her and ""it"" so seriously.",1970-12-17T05:00:00+0000

That it contains a fantasy for just about everyone, perhaps with the exception of Herbert Marcuse. That it looks to be clean and pure and without artifice, even though it is possibly as sophisticated as any commercial American movie ever made. That my admiration for the mechanics of it slops over into a real admiration for the movie itself.I'm talking, of course, about ""Love Story,"" the movie from which Erich Segal extracted his best-selling non-novel, mostly, it seems, by appending ""she said's"" and ""I said's"" and an occasional ""I remonstrated"" to the dialogue in his original screenplay.The film, which opened yesterday at the Loew's State I and Tower East Theaters, is about a love affair so perfect that even the death that terminates it becomes a symbol of its perfection.When, at the end, Jenny (ne Cavilleri), the self-styled social zero from Cranston, R. I., the daughter of an Italian baker, is dying of a carefully unidentified blood disease in the arms of her husband, Oliver Barrett 4th, the preppie millionaire from Boston, there is nothing to disfigure love, or faith, or even the complexion. It's as if she were suffering from some kind of vaguely unpleasant Elizabeth Arden treatment. Jenny doesn't die. She just slips away in beauty.The knowledge that Jenny willhow should I put itdisappear not only gives the movie its shape (it is told in flashback), but it also endows everything  from a snowball fight in the Harvard Yard to a confrontation with snob parents in Ispwichwith an intensity that is no less sweet for being fraudulent.Curiously, the novel, which I found almost unreadable (I think it might be as readily absorbed if kept under one's pillow), plays very well as a movie, principally, I suspect because Jenny is not really Jenny but Ali MacGraw, a kind of all-American, Radcliffe madonna figure, and Oliver Barrett 4th is really Ryan O'Neal, an intense, sensitive young man whose handsomeness has a sort of crookedness to it that keeps him from being a threat to male members of the audience. They are both lovely.Then, too, Arthur Hiller, the director, has framed what is essentially a two-character story of undergraduate love with such seeming simplicity that nothing confuses the basic situation. He also associates his film and his characters with all of the good things in life. Jenny and Oliver fall in love in the snow (snow, clean and pure, is very important in the movie.) They court in front of libraries, and they make love (nothing too explicit mind you) while doing homework.When Jenny swears, she fondly uses a four-letter word that was shocking in the fifties, but that even mid-American matrons have heard now. When Oliver graduates from law school, he takes a job with an old, extremely respectable, New York law firm, but it's one that specializes in civil-rights cases. When Jenny is growing weaker, she can't remember the Mozart Kchel listings she once knew. Jenny and Oliver have (middle) class.""Love Story"" not only revives a kind of movie fiction that I'd thought vanished, it also revives the rich, WASP movie hero who rebels, but not too drastically, and it brings back the kind of wonderful movie aphorism that persists in saying nothing when it tries to say the most (""love means never having to say you're sorry"").Francis Lai's background score, mixes Bach and Mozart and Handel with Lai, and resolutely avoids rock. Although Jenny does disappear at the end, everyone in the audience can take heart in identificationthe ladies, because they can see how much will be missed, and the gentlemen, who will have the honor of being abandoned by one of fiction's most blessed females. I might add that Oliver, though distraught, is also very rich, and he has promised Jenny to be a merry widower.I can't remember any movie of such comparable high-style, kitsch since Leo McCarey's ""Love Affair"" (1939) and his 1957 remake, ""An Affair to Remember."" The only really depressing thing about ""Love Story"" is the thought of all of the terrible imitations that will inevitably follow it.",1970-12-18T05:00:00+0000

A 50-minute film devoted to The Incredible String Band, written by The Incredible String Band (i.e. Mike Herron and Robin Williamson), and celebrating the imagination and life-style of the band and their two companions and colleagues, Rose and Licorice.The manner of film-making in ""Be Glad . . ."" is for the most part familiar enough, with bits of performance (poorly synchronized), snippets of interviews, extensive location shooting of the Incredibles at home among the fields and hedgerows of their native Britain, and even one rather elaborate musical montage, in the style of movie dance-band treatment in the 1930's. The film ends with a mimed playlet called ""The Pirate and the Crystal BallA Fable,"" which is about what the title says it is about and which was written by the Incredibles, who also provide a background score of slightly exotic whimsey.My distaste for ""Be Glad . . ."" is a distaste for The Incredible String Band, and not for what the movie has made of themespecially since they seem pretty largely to have made the movie in their own image. That imagewith its dreadful incantatory poetry, its ready invocation of magical attitudes, its manufactured myth and mysticismsuggests a kind of Victorian pastoral dottiness, as if in aspiring to a Druidical world view they had fallen far short and come up, their garlands askew, with a fifth-rate imitation of Swinburne's ""Hertha"" instead.The Incredible String Band, all two of them (the young women seem mostly given to rhythm on stage and rustic handicrafts off), play a variety of instruments ranging from guitar and sitar, through violin and harpsichord, to recorder and lute. But I find their relation to these instruments approximately as convincing as their relation to natural magica promotion of meritorious display rather than a real commitment to the materials of an art.There is more art, more truth, more beauty, and infinitely better musicianship in ""Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins,"" a short film about the Texas blues singer Lightnin' (Sam) Hopkins, on the program with ""Be Glad . . ."" Built around what I gather was the return of Hopkins to his home town for a visit sometime in 1967, the film is, like ""Be Glad . . .,"" as much a celebration of a mode of life as it is a study of a kind of music.It is also fairly conventional film making (the conventions of documentary poetic realism), but in Hopkins and his friends it has a quality of life rather than a fabricated group image for a subject.Almost everybody in ""Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins"" seems to be a performer. But Hopkins himself controls the film's moods. Not so much in his exposition of the meaning of the blues as in what he makes of them when he sings and plays his guitar. In this he is very fine  with wit, virtuosity and the immersion in his medium that is a music maker's true exemplary magic.",1970-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion':Suspense Melodrama Opens at Baronet,"Elio Petri's complex, entertaining new Italian film, ""Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater, is a suspense melodrama with the moral concerns of angry satire. A psychotic policeman, the chief of the homicide squad who has been newly promoted to head the political intelligence unit, sets out to affirm, ""in all of its purity,"" the concept of authority  that absolute power before which all men become servile children, if not idiots.One hot summer afternoon, the Inspector (Gian Maria Volonte) pays a call on his mistress (Florinda Bolkan), a beautiful, kinky masochist with whom he acts out fantasies based on famous crimes. ""How will you kill me this time?"" she asks. ""I'll cut your throat,"" he says, and she shivers with pleasure. A few minutes later, as they are thrashing around between her Op-patterned sheets, he takes a razor blade and slices her jugular vein.Afterwards, he takes a shower, has a drink (carefully leaving his fingerprints on the glass and the bottle), places a torn thread from his tie under her finger nail, makes several bloody footprints in the hall, and then calls the police to report the crime.As the investigation of the murder proceeds, the police, at the Inspector's urging, first focus their interest on the dead woman's homosexual husband, then on an anarchist student with whom she's been having an affair. The Inspector, however, comes to realize that the conviction of an innocent man will not prove his own inviolability.Thus he arranges a kind of final test, whereby his subordinates and superiors must face the indisputable evidence of his guilt, which, if denied, will be the ultimate affirmation.Mr. Petri (""A Quiet Place in the Country,"" ""The Tenth Victim"") is a Communist who does not make light films lightly, a fact, I fear, that prevents him from being taken as seriously as he should by movie puristsa breed known for both lack of humor and complete intolerance for baldly stated dialectics.However, although Mr. Petri quite consciously makes movies about ideas, he has, in his ""Investigation,"" made a movie in which the ideas, and the man who seethes with them, have the shock and impact of the most fundamental kind of melodrama.When it opened in Italy early this year (and later, when it was shown at Cannes), ""Investigation"" was hailed for the ways in which it exposed the corrupt, authoritarian practices of the police, who place themselves above their own laws. For me, however, it is not most interesting on this social level, or even on the psychological level, if the film means to demonstrate the manner in which power corrupts.The Inspector does make some reference to his long enjoyment of power, and the film, in flashbacks, does suggest that the girl prompted her own death, first by convincing the Inspector that he was above the law, and then by ridiculing his sexual performance. (As did Bernardo Bertolucci in ""The Conformist,"" Mr. Petri equates repressive political philosophy with derailed sex.)The film, however, is not especially convincing as a case historyat least, I was not convinced that, had he gone into another line of work, the Inspector might not have become a psychotic supermarket manager.It is as a kind of political parable that ""Investigation"" is a stunning movie. From the start, one is fascinated by the methods (rather than origins) of the Inspector's madness, by the terrible logic of his paranoia (at one point he gives an extraordinary speech in which he equates murderers with agitators, rapists with anarchists), and by the brilliance with which he constructs his apotheosis. ""Investigation,"" unlike ""The Conformist,"" is not about the rank-and-file Fascist.

One minute he is noisy and arrogant, the next he is obsequious and sly.

us,Elliott Gould Vehicle Also Makes Bow,"There's an exhilarating feeling of high expectancy as ""I Love My Wife"" takes off in high glee at the Paris Theater to illustrate Elliott Gould's amiable confusion about love, sex and marriage. But after a couple of fast reels, highlighted by some imaginative quick cuts, newsreel footage and equally germane, colloquial wisecracks, a viewer not subject to the draft (and, perhaps, those who are) is left with as much confusion as the film's unfulfilled star. As an attempt to unravel with a light touch the ties that bind, ""I Love My Wife"" ends up pretty much the same gnarled knot it was at the start.Mel Stuart's direction and Robert Kaufman's hip, glib script is good for chuckles as Gould is kaleidoscopically flipped from virgin, inhibited, middle class youth to marriage (if not precisely wedded bliss) with Brenda Vaccaro and fatherhood as a struggling interne. But the bloom rapidly fades, of course, as Miss Vaccaro grows fat and apathetic to his passes. And a good deal of the ensuing footage is devoted to the hero's succession of extramarital affairs, as, we presume, he searches for true love while exhibiting surface angst and indecision.""What happened to the wonderful guy I married?"" Miss Vaccaro asks somewhat desperately after her now successful surgeon-husband has turned up bushed after another night in an alien boudoir. It's a good question since, in the generally superficial style of the script and direction, a number of serious questions and problems are posed but rarely solved satisfactorily.Certainly the director and writer touch a good many bases to indicate that their wandering boy is a lovable, contemporary type with contemporary hangups. He's convinced he loves his wife and two children, which is illustrated fleetingly, as in a touching Christmas scene. And he even sends his burgeoning spouse to an expensive slimming establishment and to a psychiatrist and he gets rid of his mother-in-law in efforts to set his house in order while he continues to daily and indulge in further vacillation.When his liaison with Angel Tompkins, as the demanding honey blonde TV actress and wife of a baseball player, becomes too hot for him to handle (even after he's feigned a separation from his hausfrau) the devious doctor is ready to return to hearth and home, but is coolly spurned by his mate, who now seems to be headed for a quieter life of her own. It's hardly surprising that after all the backing and filling this less than fine romance, running down somewhat aimlessly from a promising start, ends nowhere as the indecisive medico is seen in the process of making another quick conquest.As the haphazardly swinging surgeon, Elliott Gould is casually natural even though he appears to be only vaguely bothered by his largely self-imposed troubles. Despite his indicated good intentions and good humor, he emerges as a basically self-centered, shallow citizen. One's appreciation and sympathy mainly go to Miss Vaccaro, whose often zanily comic, sometimes poignantly realistic, characterization as his logically harried wife, is highly polished and looms larger than Gould's stellar services.Miss Tompkins is efficient and notably photogenic as the lady who won't take maybe for an answer. And, more importantly, she stresses one of the film's most pertinent observations, ""You can't have it both ways."" Unfortunately, ""I Love My Wife"" tries that trick and doesn't succeed.",1970-12-22T05:00:00+0000

In tone and attitude, if not in scope, the Berri enterprise begs comparison with Truffaut's great Antoine movies. But on every level and in every way, the comparison goes sadly against Claude Berri.Berri is usually cited as being like Truffaut, but more sentimental. In fact, he is no more sentimental (or, more accurately, no more committed to the primacy of sentiment) than Truffaut, but he is, at least on film, very much less intelligent. For Truffraut's sense of a morally cohesive, humanly relevant universe (a sense that makes ""Stolen Kisses"" a masterpiece, no matter what its warmth of feeling), Berri can offer only an anecdotal appreciation of experience. Typically, his films get whatever form they have from the shape of public eventsthe great wars of our time. But in the context of the films, those events mean nothing.In ""The Man With Connections"" the time is the mid-1950's, the war is in Algeria, and young Claude (Guy Bedos), an aspiring actor who meanwhile manufactures caps with his father and mother, faces conscription. His parents counsel courage, his mistress offers logic (one month with her has gone quickly; 18 months in the army can only be one times 18) and a friend promises to pull strings. The strings give the film its title, and by that perverse fatality that guides the cutting of orders, they help move Claude from basic training outside Paris, to Morocco, to Algeriawhere he spends much time in the guardhouse but never does see combat.As a service comedy, ""The Man With Connections"" is predictable but not unpleasing. The various portraits work well enoughespecially Georges Geret as the French equivalent of a field first sergeant (""Don't play stupid with me. You may not win!"") and Jean-Pierre Marielle as a Lieutenant Cassanova, who suavely courts Claude when he thinks that Claude's connections may win the outfit a visit from Brigitte Bardot.But a service comedy in the context of Algeria is a possible improbability, and Berri, who doesn't appear antiarmy or even antiwar, for that matter, ends his film with a wholly unearned irony that is supposed to connect with the larger terror behind every laugh the military mind can give you. Like all the other connections, this one, which opposes a kind of maniacal laughter to all the previous good humor, doesn't work, but to the embarrassment of the film rather than its main character.But even where it avoids embarrassment, ""The Man With Connections"" touches no major experience it does not belittle. For example, halfway through the film, Claude writes his mistress from North Africa to advise her not to wait for him because he is not ready to marry her. For just a moment we see the girl (Zorica Lozic) on her bed crying, and that is the last we see of her. The shot has the look of romantic economya look we (and surely Claude Berri) have come to value from the best of Truffaut and Jean Renoir. But whereas, in Renoir or Truffaut, that moment's pathos would relate to an orderromantic or notthat such economy might serve, in Berri it has no such relation because there is no order. There is merely the rush of circumstanceindifferent, callous and despite the ready tears, essentially cruel.",1970-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'There Was a Crooked Man ...' and a Myth:Mankiewicz Western Begins Local Run,"""There Was A Crooked Man . . ."" and his name was Paris Pitman Jr. (Kirk Douglas), a charming, red-haired outlaw who didn't hesitate to shoot his best friend in the back to get closer to $500,000. There also was a straight man, named Woodward Lopeman (Henry Fonda), a fine, brave, incorruptible sheriff who had liberal ideas about penology and a civilized distaste for violence.In that legendary time of the West (when it's always 1870), the two men meet at the Territorial Prison, set in the middle of a plain as arid and bleak as a landscape out of Krazy Kat. Lopeman is the warden and Pitman is his prisoner.With all the patience and understanding of a sidewalk salvationist confronting his first live sinner, the warden sets out to rehabilitate Pitman. He works and works and works until, one day . . . . but I'd better not say since that is, after all, the point of ""There Was A Crooked Man. . .""The new film, which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and Trans-Lux West theaters, was written by David Newman and Robert Benton, best known for ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" a movie that combined Americana, melodrama, farce, legend and social satire to make the practically perfect movie for the schizoid '60's. It was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who usually writes his own scriptsurbane, sardonic comedies (""Letters to Three Wives,"" ""All About Eve,"" ""The Honey Pot"") that belong to an earlier, more classic period of movie-making.Whatever might be one's expectations of such a collaboration, they may, unfortunately, work against an easy appreciation of the completed movie. Although ""There Was A Crooked Man. . . ."" is rather low-keyed and takes its own sweet time to reveal itself, it is a movie of the sort of taste, intelligence and somewhat bitter humor I associate with Mr. Mankiewicz who, in real life, is one of America's most sophisticated, least folksy raconteurs, especially of stories about (the old Hollywood.""There Was a Crooked Man. . . ."" is the veteran movie maker's first Western, but it is somehow illuminated by his awareness of the heritage of old Hollywood, epecially in the roles of Mr. Douglas and Mr. Fonda, who play variations on their mythical movie selves. Mr. Douglas is an outlaw who, for a change, really is as mean as he's supposed to be, and Mr. Fonda is the pure herowith both feet in a clay pit.One of the movie's bothersome idiosyncracies is that it wants to utilize its myths and to work against them. Thus, the film, which begins as broad satire, turns into fairly straight melodrama involving prison riots and such things, before ending on a note of gentle cynicism that is not as dramatically satisfying as it is theoretically intelligent. The mixtures of moods and genres require some patience on our part.It's worth it, I think, for ""There Was A Crooked Man . . ."" is full of what seem to be (but aren't) the old-fashioned virtues of commercial moviemaking. Mr. Douglas and Mr. Fonda are in splendid shape Hollywood stars performing with the kind of ease and wit that comes with nondebilitating age. Equally at ease are the members of the large supporting cast, including Burgess Meredith, Warren Oates, Martin Gabel, and especially Hume Cronyn and John Randolph, who play a pair of aging confidence men whose long-time homosexual relationship has evolved into crochety, benign despair.Mr. Mankiewicz is not at his best in staging the big, brawling scenes of roughhouse and riot that erupt throughout the film, but that may be simply because they don't seem to fit into the main scheme of the movie. ""There Was A Crooked Man . . ."" is really a duel between two men, one good, one bad, and it's these smaller, more civilized confrontations, done with irony and wit, that make the film one of the more pleasant things you're likely to see this season.",1970-12-26T05:00:00+0000

us,screen: 'The Lady in the Car With Glasses and Gun':Samantha Eggar Stars in Mystery Story,"As movie titles go, ""The Lady in the Car With Glasses and a Gun"" will serve for at least two reasons. First, it tells you several things that are in the movie, one-half of which (lady and gun) are probably dangerous, without, however, presuming to tell you how you should feel about them. And second, it helps render the movie review-proof, for after the critic has mentioned the title a few times he will, if all goes well, have no space left for his review.Anyway, Anatole Litvak's ""The Lady in the Car With Glasses and a Gun,"" based on a novel of the same name by Sebastien Japrisot, opened yesterday at the Festival and Rivoli Theaters. And while it as not as good as it ought to be, given the excellence of its fiction and some of its leading cast, it is nevertheless good enough in mood and in performance to offer more than routine satisfaction to any lover of mystery films.The lady (Samantha Eggar) is an English girl working in a Paris advertising agency. The car is an enormous white American convertible with which her boss (Oliver Reed) entrusts her after she drops off him and his wife (Stephane Audran) at the airport for a business-pleasure trip to Geneva.In the crush of holiday traffic she makes a wrong turnsouth, instead of back to Paris, and when she discovers her mistake she decides to take the car on a brief Mediterranean holiday of her own.It is her dark glasses (on prescription  she is terribly nearsighted) as much as anything else that convinces people along the way that they have seen her before, in the same car, driving north along the same road that very morning. And when her hand is painfully crushed by an unseen stranger in a service station, and the attendant swears that she was wearing a bandage for the sprain hours before, when she stopped for a minor repair, she realizes that she is facing not just disturbing coincidence but very real danger.By the time she finds the gunaccompanying a corpse that turns up in the car's trunk  she is desperate. Along the way she has picked up a young drifter (John McEnery) who may be her salvation or her doom.But there is really nobody she can trust, not even, given the weight of circumstantial evidence, herself. Everything in considerable and quite intimate detail, seems to prove that she has committed murder.Given the possibilities of his plot, Mr. Litvak has emphasized local effect and psychological thrills at the expense of the malevolent logic that is supposed to trap his heroine. Although it is often properly terrifying, one (night-time) meeting between Mr. McEnery and Miss Eggar in an automated garage full of cars and empty of people is especially unsetting. ""The Lady in the Car, etc,"" doesn't always make senseor even those gestures toward sense that will sometimes do if the theme is dark enough.Consequently, in relation to better works in its genre, the film looks rather like an example of the decline of craftsmanship  effective, well-colored, but uncertain in line and construction.Both Stephane Audran (a superb actress in other movies) and the uncomfortably ponderous Oliver Reed contribute to the uncertainty. John McEnery (who, as Mercutio, was the best person in the Zeffirelli ""Romeo and Juliet"") plays his semi-sympathetic role, however, with the right ambivalent mixture of charm, menace and indifference. Samantha Eggar is so fine that she is in herself sufficient justification for the movie. Beautiful, intelligent and tough enough to be fascinatingly vulnerable, she seems almost to have been type-cast into excellent roles: ""The Collector,"" ""The Walking Stick"" and now ""The Lady in the Car.""The last may be her best. She makes of it something wonderfully complex, sustained, varied. She marvelously suggests, in what is really a virtuoso performance, those dim and half-felt areas where mysterious fate and the mysteries of personality touch and merge.",1970-12-26T05:00:00+0000

The color feature is a joy andfortunately for everybody, young and young-heartedtheaters are playing it all over the metropolitan area. Talk about cats, manthese aristocats have it.The real beauty of the picture, which is as amusing, smoothly machined and beautifully colored as any Disney should be, is in the characterizations, sustained within a sprightly but simple format. Back in 1962, the brilliant over-stylization of ""Gay Purr-ee,"" from the rival U.P.A. company, for instance, all but rendered it juiceless in the human interest department, cat-people style. Not this round-up.Again, the settings are Paris and the countryside, all in pretty pastels. The plot concerns the ""catnapping"" of an elegant mama cat and her three kittens by a jealous butler and the victims' adventuresome homeward trek. The original story is credited to Tom Rowe and Tom Mc-Gowan. But in any animated feature, bulging with technical contributors plus director plus producer, it's hard to know who really did what.What matters is that the picture is grand fun all the way, nicely flavored with tunes, and topped with one of the funniest jam sessions ever by a bunch of scraggly Bohemians headed by one Scat Cat. And dig that yellow-cat hippie with the purple glasses and beads, sawing on his cello.But the animal characters with their human nuances are the main dish and delight, ranging from cute to hilarious, thanks to animation wizardry and flavorsome voice-matching by Eva Gabor, Phil Harris, Hermione Baddeley and a battery of others.It would be hard to imagine a more disarming woman in distress than the purry heroine, Duchess, with her toddling Toulouse, Berlioz and Marie, who are protected by O'Malley, a kind-hearted, alley cat Don Juan. Quite a guy, this one. Likewise brave little Roquefort, a pearshaped mouse. Let's also salute Napoleon and Lafayette, two tired Southern-fried hounds who are a riot. The wily butler, his gracious employer and her frisky, ancient lawyer do well enough forwell, human beings.But funniest of all are Agatha and Abigail, two bonnet-wearing, spinster geese  very proper, very giggly and very British""on a walking tour of Frawnce."" Wait until you see them walk. And hooray for their Uncle Waldo, a swinging old gander who escapes from a restaurant kitchen, half-crocked and with tail-feathers plucked.

Because of thepotency and contemporaneity of the subject mat ter and its suitability for environmental theater, one is necessarily interested. It is not in its intent, but in its conception and per formance that Commune is disappointing. The play is compiled and arranged from various sources and group improvisations. Pre sumably, with inspiration, such pieces  acted, danced, physicalized could be transformed into something whole, a collage, the play about Middle America by the children of Middle America  no cop outs, no kidding, that Scheduler has promised. The truth is that beneath the theorizing, the envir onmental aspects, the audi ence encounter, Commune is not very revealing about communal life (or for that matter, life today), and notvery experimental as thea ter.

us,Screen: 'A Very Curious Girl' Takes Her Revenge:Nelly Kaplan Directs a French Feature,"Ever since Marie reached the age of puberty (and, perhaps, even before), the citizens of the bleak little village of Tellier have been having their way with the girl, an always sullen, sometimes beautiful slavey with no last name. When the postman comes to tell Marie that her mother has just been fatally winged by a hit-and-run driver, he tries to effect a quick rape before breaking the news. Nobody thinks much about Marie herself. She simply provides services, as does a public utility.Nelly Kaplan's first feature film, ""A Very Curious Girl"" (original title: ""La Fiance du Pirate""), is the often amusing, cool, unsentimental story of Marie's revenge. When she acquires a tape recorder and starts charging for those services she earlier provided free, Marie confronts the local representatives of church, state, industry and agriculture with the images of their own inhumanity. They may be no better off for it but, for Marie, its a journey towards liberation.""A Very Curious Girl,"" which opened yesterday at the Murray Hill Theater, comes to us with the recommendation of no less an authority than Pablo Picasso, who calls it ""insolence raised to the status of art"" and says that he finds in it ""the same atmosphere as in the best films of Luis Buuel.""I suspect that Mr. Picasso's film criticism has, in this case, been shaped as much by an affection for Miss Kaplan, who made a highly praised, one-hour film about the artist in 1967, as by what I can only regard as his somewhat special view of Mr. Buuel. It must be thatto Mr. Picassothe best films of his extraordinary countryman seem a lot more jolly and optimistic than they do to those of us who don't share ancient Spanish roots.To compare ""A Very Curious Girl"" with the work of Buuel is to burden a picturesque burro with the treasures of the Alhambra. It can't carry the weight. The film is as unequivocably moral as a Marcel Pagnol tale and its humor more Gallic than grief-stricken, closer in tone to any number of Fernandel movies than to anything conceived in the ferocious mind of Buuel.At heart, Miss Kaplan's movie is the record of one woman's amazing financial, physical and emotional achievements, elevated above your general run of quaint, come-uppance histories by the humor and good sense of the director. Bernadette Lafont, Claude Chabrol's favorite early heroine (""Le Beau Serge,"" ""A Double Tour""), plays Marie with a kind of sexless, intellectual wrath, which makes all the fuss about her legendary sensuality even funnier than it might be if she were a steamy teen-ager.I also liked Georges Geret (who played the psychopathic murderer in Buuel's version of ""Diary of a Chambermaid""), as the postman who likes to peep while making his rounds, and Jacques Marin (the baffled detective in ""Darling Lili""), as one of Marie's most helpless clients. Claire Maurier, whom I remember only from ""The 400 Blows,"" in which she played Antoine's adulterous mother, turns up here as a leather-skinned, Lesbian farmer, and Louis Malle, the director, plays a tiny role as another of Marie's lovers. Miss Kaplan has obviously received more than a little help from her friends.Not so successful are those moments when the director consciously tries to create a dark vision of a world that might have been created by Buuel. A drunken funeral scene manages to remind one of ""Viridiana,"" but without much joy and with absolutely no horror. ""A Very Curious Girl"" is, instead, effective as an optimistic object lesson. There are multiple rewards to be earned when aimless lust is organized and put on a strictly cash basis.",1970-12-31T05:00:00+0000
