us,North Korean Diplomats Disrupt Human Rights Panel," A United Nations panel on North Korean human rights abuses, organized by the United States delegation at the organizations New York headquarters, briefly degenerated into shouting and disorder Thursday when three North Korean diplomats disrupted the event to deliver a statement denying any wrongdoing in their country. The diplomats interrupted North Korean defectors who were testifying about the deprivations they said they had endured. The United States ambassador, Samantha Power, threatened to call in United Nations security guards to evict the North Korean diplomats, but they left after about six minutes. Ms. Power said  that the North Korean diplomats had been invited to speak but only after the defectors had spoken, and unfortunately, as you heard, the delegation chose instead to try to drown out the testimony of these panelists. She also told the defectors, It must be chilling for those of you who have been subjected to the terror of the regime to be confronted with bullying and disruption and the kind of behavior that we saw today. North Korea has become increasingly angry over actions by the United Nations during the past few years, most notably a human rights report that described much of the country as a large penal colony and called for possible prosecution of North Korean leaders at the International Criminal Court. The United Nations Security Council has tightened sanctions against North Korea because of its nuclear weapons and missile tests. The North Korean authorities have accused the United States of orchestrating such actions as part of what they call an American plot to destabilize their country. ",2015-05-01T01:57:25+0000

Add to that her four-decade career writing brilliant and often despairing novels about the black experience in America, and its no wonder interviewers frequently want her to proclaim about race relations or the latest tragedy playing out on the nations television screens. Morrison  whose new novel, God Help the Child, hits the hardcover fiction list at No.5  sometimes obliges them. People keep saying, We need to have a conversation about race, she told The Telegraph last month. This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a black woman. Then when you ask me, Is it over?, I will say yes. (Almost 20 years ago, I heard Morrison read from an early draft of her novel Paradise, and when an audience member asked if the gains of the civil rights movement might herald an imminent end to racism, Morrison paused and slowly shook her head. I am not optimistic, she said.) But there is a less foreboding, more playful side to Morrison as well: The critic John Leonard once reported that she liked to chat with Fran Lebowitz about Court TV, and she told The Telegraph that Marlon Brando used to call just to recite her work: I still have his number in my iPhone!

Churkin, said Yemen was running out of food and medicine and sharply suggested that the United States, which supports the bombings, is responsible for their humanitarian consequences. Russia had proposed a statement that would be unenforceable, and not legally binding. If you cant agree to a motherhood and apple pie statement, what can you agree on? he said. The criticism was in sharp contrast to Russias response to efforts by Western countries over the last couple of years to force the Syrian government, which Russia supports, to allow aid convoys into rebel-held areas.

Premiering exclusively on T, the trailer for the film Troublemakers reveals an intersecting group of artists in the late 60s and early 70s, united equally by their communion with the elements and their anti-authoritarian attitudes. Often shirtless and shot in grainy black-and-white footage, some of which has never before been shown, the literal groundbreakers profiled  such as Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria and Robert Smithson  do little to undercut their mythologies as difficult or headstrong or rebellious, Crump says. But troublemaking can also mean instigation or stirring up the waters, and it implies critique, he adds, noting that land art emerged at the same time Americans were confronting images of bombed-out landscapes from the Vietnam War and of the cratered surface of the moon. There was an urgency to make the work, Crump says  even if the artworks, like the open vistas that animated them, defied collecting as an investable asset class.",2015-05-04T18:30:18+0000

The references she gave me all spoke highly of her, though only one family seemed to know her well. Fast-forward three months. I come home one evening, and the nanny is not yet back with my daughter. When she arrives, half an hour late, she is visibly intoxicated and reeks of alcohol. I immediately fire her after getting a verbal admission that she was drinking. I later found out that the nanny was previously fired by another family for being drunk on the job. The nanny lives with her 10-year-old son in my neighborhood, where many people use a local email list to seek out nannies. I know that she responds to these email ads, and I have just found out that she currently has another job with a family, but I dont know who the family is or how to contact them. My husband does not want me to post anything on our local email list, for fear of retribution. I am losing sleep that this woman is still taking care of children, and I am also worried about her sons safety. What can I do that does not put my family at risk but does not make me feel complicit?

The disembarkation, he said, commenced at daybreak on April 25, in face of great opposition from entrenched infantry and artillery, and by nightfall 29,000 men had landed. The British and Indian troops disembarked at Seddul Bahr. The Indians were held up during the whole day, but eventually succeeded by a fine attack in taking up their positions, enabling them to cover the landing of the remainder of the forces. The disembarkation of the Australians and New Zealanders at Gaba Tepe was opposed by heavy fire at point- blank range, but with a rush they carried the position and pushing forward the attack with the greatest dash. The French forces which landed at Hum Kalessi, on the Asiatic shore, advanced with great gallantry.  The New York Herald, European edition, May 7, 1915",2015-05-06T14:15:30+0000

Art is a shadow of a shadow. This is why a lot of these philosophers didnt really have a place for art  they saw it as a distraction, says Zelehoski in his self-built studio in Beacon, New York, where hes been working since a fateful trip to Dia, the minimalist Mecca, back in 2011. For his upcoming exhibit, Zelehoski has transformed found objects, mostly discarded wooden stockroom palettes and police barricades, into intricately cut 2D, wall-mounted assemblages.

Once contact is made, the bro-huggers exchange two or three hearty back slaps and then uncouple. In the comedy The D Train, theres no such retreat  only sweet, sweaty surrender.

Phillips was born on the island of St. Kitts in 1958, but as an infant he left with his parents during the mass migration of people from the Caribbean islands  still colonial subjects  to Britain in the 1950s. Immigration has been a key topic in Phillipss work from his very first novel, The Final Passage (1985). His first two novels were fairly straightforward in style and structure, but with his third, Higher Ground (1989), Phillips introduced the more ambitious and unconventional approach he has used ever since. Rather than tell one linear story, these later novels bring together several independent narratives set at different places on the globe and at different moments in time.

This installment takes the characters from 1953 through 1986, introducing a new generation and letting them contend with milestones like the Vietnam War, Jim Joness seductive Peoples Temple and the early days of the AIDS crisis. In some hands the conceit could have felt gimmicky or forced, a kissing cousin to Forrest Gump or Billy Joels We Didnt Start the Fire. But reviewers so far have been largely impressed, comparing Smiley to the giants of 19th-century literature. (Americas Tolstoy, ruled Christobel Kent in The Guardian.) Smiley also keeps an eye on her forebears, if more humbly. Trollope would sneer, she told one interviewer last year, after announcing she was about done with the trilogys 1,300 pages. In the same profile, she remembered with approval the motivational note  Nobody asked you to write this novel  that a former classmate kept taped to her typewriter. What we do as writers is voluntary, so dont complain, Smiley said, recalling how inspired she was by an exhibit of hand-corrected page proofs at the Balzac museum in Paris.

(It was the latter pursuit that led her to discover her signature technique of mounting metallic foil behind gemstones to enhance their color and shine.) Now, Satloff has commissioned a series of photographs by Horacio Salinas, debuting exclusively here, that capture her designs in their historical and artistic context. The images, styled by the creative director and former jewelry editor Talya Cousins, take as their point of departure an antique book of bird illustrations printed in 1873; they feel, Satloff says, almost as if a bird had flown in and collected the jewelry.

The Iranian news media reported Sunday that the airline, Mahan Air, bought the aircraft  eight Airbus A340s and one A321  for an undisclosed amount from unidentified sellers, and that they were placed into service last week. The Iranian news accounts described the purchase as an important boost for the countrys civilian aviation industry, which has struggled for many years because of an aging fleet and American-imposed restrictions on access to replacement aircraft, parts, technology and service. Mahan Air was placed on a sanctions list in October 2011 by the Treasury Department over what it called the airlines support for activities of Irans Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and Hezbollah militants. The purchase could inflame congressional critics of the nuclear talks who contend that Iran cannot be trusted and that it already is openly flouting the sanctions. ",2015-05-12T01:58:06+0000

We believe that collective treatment is not only proper, but the most efficient and effective way to handle the claims, he said. ",2015-05-12T02:29:39+0000

It seems absolutely natural that this bosquet as it is now is here, mused the Versailles president Catherine Pgard, as she sat in the shade of one of the new Japanese angelica trees and proudly took it all in. Its a totally contemporary work that is perfectly integrated into the parks history. So harmonious. Above is a closer look at yesterdays show.",2015-05-12T20:50:38+0000

The contested part of the proposal remains unchanged in Tuesdays version, which details the policy and is open to public comment for 60 days before a final decision.

Destitute, in a manner of speaking, Jasmine flies first-class to San Francisco to begin life anew with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins), whose scrappy existence and brutish men Jasmine can barely stomach without self-medicating with vodka and Xanax. Then she meets a diplomatic type (Mr. Sarsgaard) with an appreciation for her decorating talents and designer threads and starts to see light at the end of her dark tunnel.

Studying the trend hed seen in the previous few years, Moore predicted that every year wed double the number of transistors that could fit on a single chip of silicon so youd get twice as much computing power for only slightly more money. When that came true, in 1975, he modified his prediction to a doubling roughly every two years.

Evoking the minimal but potent energy of an Ad Reinhardt painting, the photographs display tone and emulsion only, embodying the pure essence of a tumultuous swell while simultaneously dissembling the photographic process. The second and edgier half, the Wave Series, presents only the whisper of a wave crest and is deeply indebted to Richard Serra. My aunt created a masterpiece at age 23.

It will be the first case to be tried in Africa on the principle of universal jurisdiction, which holds that certain crimes transcend borders, and it has the backing of the African Union. A panel of judges from Burkina Faso and Senegal will preside. Mr. Habrs prosecution is the result of a campaign began more than two decades ago by some of his former prisoners, supported by human rights groups, who demanded an end to Mr. Habrs comfortable exile in Senegal, where he fled after he was ousted in 1990. He became president in 1982, receiving weapons and funds from the United States, which sought a counterweight to neighboring Libya. He was indicted in 2013, accused of killing thousands of political prisoners and torturing uncounted others during his eight years in office. ",2015-05-14T00:53:23+0000

The immigration authorities will no longer point to a general goal of deterring illegal border crossing as the reason for detaining women and children. But the authorities will continue to place a high priority on deporting or detaining migrants caught crossing the border illegally. Central American women seeking asylum and their children have faced many months in detention while their cases moved through the immigration courts.

The prosecutor in Mr. McLellans case had expressed displeasure that Congress had been given sealed court filings and offered him a settlement of half his money. Last week, the Justice Department said it would investigate two other prosecutors after one business owner whose assets were seized said he had been punished more harshly after publicizing his case and another said he had been threatened with a felony charge if he did not agree to give up some of his money.

(TMC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Mr. Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Cline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Jose Croze is a speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. The phrase triumph of the human spirit hovers over The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichs, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind  among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration  Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.) Their common subject, however, is freedom, the self-willed liberation of a difficult, defiant individual, he added, noting that Mr. Schnabel demonstrated this with imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.",2015-05-14T05:00:06+0000

Armed men were seen confiscating bundles of khat, burning them in bonfires and inspecting the markets for violators.

The Houthis, who have received support from Iran, occupied the capital and ousted the president in recent months.

(Starz Cinema) FOR NO GOOD REASON (2014) I really thought what I would do, if I ever learned to draw properly, was I would try to change the world, the British artist Ralph Steadman explains in Charlie Pauls documentary about him. So in 1970, Mr. Steadman jetted to New York, where he planned to take a thousand photographs that would inspire the illustrations he couldnt seem to get quite right. There was an arrogance missing, there was a wildness missing, there was a rawness missing, he says of that early work. It lacked that bite I needed, that real ferocious bite, the thing that would make it noticeable. Then he received instructions to meet Hunter S. Thompson, not long after his infiltration of the Hells Angels. The weekend became a vicious, drunken nightmare, and he and Thompson went to pieces. Thus, gonzo journalism  in which the writer (and in this decadent collaboration, the illustrator) becomes the story  was born. What would Thompsons Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas be without Mr. Steadmans ink-speckled and splotched drawings, Mr. Steadman argues. There is a formal discipline and thematic coherence to Mr. Steadmans images that his friends writing sometimes lacked, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Steadman has frequently aimed to shock, and almost always with good reason.",2015-05-15T05:00:08+0000

As with few other authors, the charms of Murakamis books are difficult to pin down, so completely and gracefully does his work slip past the usual benchmarks of enjoyable literature. His plots are full of interesting incidents, but they build slowly, or not at all, or in a way thats completely off kilter, rather than following any real discernible arc. Regular readers of Murakami will find him reusing his favorite devices  cats, missing girls, obscure works of music  making them less startling and/or more enduring, depending on ones point of view. Structurally, his work appears to proceed by instinct rather than by strategy; his use of the third person in 1Q84, for instance, feels exactly like his vast, samey array of first-person narrators. Murakamis work brushes up against some grand themes but doesnt quite tackle them; his best novel, The WindUp Bird Chronicle, explores the horrors of World War II, but nobody would describe the book as making a major statement about war. As for his language  well, most of us New York Times readers are receiving Murakami in translation, but even so theres little to indicate were missing some grand linguistics in the original.

It is said of a dead badger sow on the road, as an unnamed man tries to cover up the evidence that she had been tethered during an illegal fight with dogs. Then he ground his foot down on the leg, Jones writes, and stamped over and over, smashing the thin precise line of the wire out of the raw flesh. The echo of that violent exclamation resonates throughout this powerful book. We move between two strands  one the unnamed badger baiter known as the big man and the other, Daniel, a Welsh farmer grieving for his recently dead wife and trying to keep her memory alive as well as their lambs. Thus the novel becomes a kind of diptych about violence, loss and the different ways one can be trapped.",2015-05-15T15:21:19+0000

In college, under Eisenhower, we were known for nothing, or for our apathy, she wrote in 1969. We are unnoticed even as we spread clear across what people call, without taking account of us, the generation gap.

He wants to be a poet, he likes Ted Hughes and Philip Larkin, and he has begun to learn that Shakespeares language isnt so much universal as rooted in English particulars.

The book (written with Benjy Eisen) opens with an anecdote from the late 1980s, when the band finally broke through to mainstream success: Its only Top 40 hit, Touch of Grey, reached No.9 on the Billboard chart; the video was in constant rotation on MTV; and the band sold out a five-night run at Madison Square Garden. The attention, Kreutzmann acknowledges, was a little overwhelming. We decided to celebrate by getting as far away from it all as possible, he writes, explaining how he and Jerry Garcia, the singer and lead guitarist, ended up scuba diving in Hawaii one day with their roadie Steve Parish. It was as psychedelic and far-out as anything we had seen during the Acid Tests, or at Woodstock, or during our strange days wandering around San Francisco during the Summer of Love. And yet, we were sober for this one. After years of persistent pot smoking, psychedelic excesses, alcohol benders, cocaine binges and heroin abuse, scuba diving was going to be our new drug. It was, eventually  Kreutzmann and Garcia dived together many times over the years, as the rest of the book makes clear. But that first trip didnt take them as far from fame as they had hoped: Underwater, a scuba instructor swam up to Garcia with a waterproof notepad and asked for his autograph. Twenty feet below the surface! Kreutzmann writes. I nearly spat out my regulator from laughing so hard.",2015-05-15T16:08:17+0000

The answer to this question is irreducibly clear: on marsala-colored cloaks! Is it a Pantone conspiracy that the design authoritys official color of the year has been tracked not once but three times on Randalls Island  in cape form? At the booth of the Bogot gallery Instituto de visin, a scroll of wine-colored fabric terminating in a poncho is emblazoned with the words PIA FOR SALE, advertising a performative action by the Mexican artist Pia Camil. Meanwhile, a not dissimilar garment has been committed to canvas by the Brazilian artist Edoardo Berliner at the booth held by the So Paulo gallery Casa Tringulo. Titled Sapatos (Shoes), the headless, matadoresque draping calls attention to the glossy black footwear beneath it. Perhaps the most striking of maroon gowns on display, however, is the chromed sculpture at Parisian dealer Jocelyn Wolffs stand. As part of an elegant solo presentation by the French artist Guillame Leblon, this merlot mantle without a wearer is an homage to Giacometti that triggers a theme consistent throughout Leblons work, the spectral absence of the body.

There is much open space in these performances, much insight and mystery, a settling into a zone between direction and indirection.

In Joshua Tree, we visit a far-out house, designed by the visionary architectKendrick Bangs Kellogg, that is nearly as awe-inspiring as the landscape itself.

But increasingly, these activities are being abandoned for the teacher-led, didactic instruction typically used in higher grades. In many schools, formal education now starts at age 4 or 5. Without this early start, the thinking goes, kids risk falling behind in crucial subjects such as reading and math, and may never catch up. ",2015-05-16T18:30:06+0000

At other times, my family worshiped with conservative Anglicans, liberal Congregationalists and assorted charismatics. After I left home for college, when a favorite professor led Shabbat services at the campus Hillel, I attended those, too.

A telegram from Lisbon received this evening [May 17] states that Senhor Chagas, the new Prime Minister, was shot at and seriously wounded by Senator Joo Jos de Freitas. Senhor Chagas had just arrived at the Entroncamento railway station, coming from Oporto to take possession of the Premiership. A large gathering was on the platform to meet him, and while shaking hands with and receiving the congratulations of his friends, Senhor Freitas broke through and fired several revolver shots at the new Premier. A struggle ensued and gendarmes fired on the assassin who was killed on the spot. Senhor Chagas was taken to hospital in a dying condition. It is feared, as a result of this tragedy, that the trouble may recommence. There are already signs of a fresh outbreak. The New York Herald, European Edition, May 18, 1915Correction: June 4, 2015An article in the In Our Pages column on May 18, recalling the shooting of the Portuguese primes minister in 1915, misspelled the name of the senator who shot Senhor Chagas. He was Joo Jos de Freitas not Senator Jean Freilas. The error was recently brought to light by a reader.",2015-05-17T07:00:07+0000

So were all-encompassing drones, hip-hop tracks that had been sped up or melted down, thoroughly warped glimmers of pop and the sounds of barking dogs and breaking glass.

us,Whats on TV Monday,"4:15 P.M. (Starz Cinema) LOVE IS STRANGE (2014) Alfred Molina and John Lithgow (above right, with Mr. Molina) portray Ben and George, a couple for 39 years who are forced to live apart after their marriage results in the loss of Georges job at a Roman Catholic school and a mortgage they can no longer afford. So Ben moves into the Brooklyn apartment of his nephew (Darren Burrows), his nephews wife (Marisa Tomei) and their son (Charlie Tahan). And George takes a spot on the living room couch of his former neighbors (Cheyenne Jackson and Manny Perez), two New York City police officers. Awkwardness ensues. The films director, Ira Sachs, is an especially careful student of the odd rhythms and quiet intensities of couplehood, both gay and straight, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Lithgow and Mr. Molina, seasoned and subtle actors, beautifully capture the small pleasures and petty irritations Ben and George live through, and also their pride at having survived, together, for so long. Mr. Sachs, he added, casts an occasional discreet glance backward at the post-Stonewall history of gay men in New York, a complicated chronicle of tragedy, resilience, struggle and fun. But that history nonetheless feels implicit in every frame, infusing what might otherwise be a touching anecdote about real estate troubles and houseguest etiquette with gravity and grace.",2015-05-18T04:06:04+0000

Myers Jr. in October, a shooting that renewed tensions with law enforcement weeks after Michael Brown was killed by an officer in nearby Ferguson. In a report released Monday, Jennifer M. Joyce, the circuit attorney for St. Louis, found that Mr. Myers produced a gun during the encounter with the officer, Jason Flanery, who was working an off-duty security detail for a private company. Police had said Mr. Myers, 18, who was black, shot a stolen handgun before Officer Flanery, who is white, returned fire. Prosecutors said in their report that witnesses had seen gunfire coming from both directions and from two guns and that a semiautomatic pistol had been recovered next to Mr. Myerss body. Mr. Myerss family disputed the police account and insisted that he had been unarmed. Protesters marched for several nights after the shooting, and some drew parallels between Mr. Myerss death and that of Mr. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old shot by a white Ferguson officer in August. In a statement, Ms. Joyce expressed condolences to the Myers family and called his death a tragic situation for our entire community. ",2015-05-19T02:32:10+0000

My parents divorced when I was 4, and I was raised mostly by my black mom, in a black neighborhood of Philadelphia, during the Black Power movement.

A five-day pause in the attacks on the North ended yesterday after Canada failed in efforts to get North Vietnam to agree to talks.

And I noted that you dont even have to believe in the soul to see this as a failure: Since the social benefits of religion seem to flow through participation and belonging, even from a purely secular perspective (well, if such a thing exists) Americas churches would probably be doing more for the poor than charity alone can offer if they werekeeping more people in the pews.",2015-05-19T17:43:17+0000

us,A Smoky Bourbon Cocktail from a Legendary Toronto Experimentalist,"Impactful aromatics have always played an essential role in the creations of the Canadian mixologist Frankie Solarik. Inside BarChef, his Modernist cocktail laboratory on Torontos Queen Street West, multisensory presentations evoke the flavors of the season  not just in the glass, but surrounding it, too. Solariks Spring Thaw is served in a cool, perfumed fog of cedar, lilac and grapefruit, billowing from a bed of wet moss that nestles a glass of vanilla Campari granita swimming in chamomile gin and sparkling wine. That drinks a showstopper, wafting in all directions across the bar; a perennial Vanilla and Hickory Smoked Manhattan (the preference of the rappers Jay-Z and Drake) is more self-contained, infused tableside under one of two antique glass domes. If those drinks appear daunting to replicate, Solariks Canadian bestseller bar manual The Bar Chef: A Modern Approach to Cocktails ($30, Harper) is released today in the United States. And if the drinks recall the culinary artistry of Grant Achatzs Alinea, it will come as no surprise that the Chicago chef penned the books foreword. Grant came into BarChef in 2009 when we first opened, and his incorporation of aromatics and theater changed my life, Solarik recalls of the research trip Achatz took prior to opening The Aviary.",2015-05-19T19:30:11+0000

The comments by the leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, suggested that the Houthis might take part in talks, sponsored by the United Nations, that were announced Wednesday and scheduled to be held in Geneva on May 28.

The panel also recommended a fine of up to $50,000, a public reprimand and Judge Murphys continued participation in a mental health therapy program. He is accused of hitting a former assistant public defender, Andrew Weinstock, outside a courtroom last June after they exchanged words over whether Mr. Weinstocks client could have a speedy trial.

In video and audio recorded inside the courtroom, Judge Murphy is heard expressing frustration at Mr. Weinstock after he announced his intention not to waive the speedy trial right of his client.

Its pivotal in some game shows, like GSNs Lie Detectors. So why not a documentary? On Thursday at 10 p.m., CNBC obliges with (Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies, an illuminating look at the whys, hows and how-oftens of the ancient practice. The program juxtaposes stories of people who have lied  two men from an inside-trader scheme; a woman who used a website that facilitates adulterous hookups; an N.B.A. referee caught in a betting scandal, and more  with studies on the nuts and bolts of lying. That research has produced counterintuitive findings. The high-stakes liars who make headlines, for instance, might draw a disproportionate amount of scorn. Yes, there are some big cheaters out there, says Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University, but they are very rare, and because of that their overall economic impact is relatively low. On the other hand, we have a ton of little cheaters, and because there are so many of us, the economic impact of small cheating is actually incredibly, incredibly high.",2015-05-22T00:13:09+0000

Ms. Cho, whose father is the chairman of Korean Air, was sentenced to a year in prison in a lower-court ruling in February. She forced a Korean Air plane to return to the gate at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Dec. 5 so the chief steward could be removed.

But of course pop fiction has long embraced difficult women: Consider Gillian Flynns Gone Girl, which blithely ruled the best-seller list even as the likability argument raged around it. Now theres another mean girl in the clique: Ani FaNelli, the protagonist of Jessica Knolls Luckiest Girl Alive, new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 12. Ani writes a sex column for a womens magazine and schemes to land a trophy husband; some reviewers have called her the mirror image of Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, since Ani seems purely manipulative at the start but becomes more human as the book reveals its secrets. Knoll, a former editor at Cosmopolitan and Self, told me theres a feminist case to be made for unlikable women. Men who are ruthless and aggressive in pursuit of their goals are acting within their culturally sanctioned bounds, she said via email, and we admire them for that. Women who do the same are punished because that hard-nosed behavior is counter to how we believe women should be, which is kind, nurturing and selfless. The knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss Ani as vain and vapid. But when we reward women for showing their full range of humanity, warts and all, when we give their struggles weight, we allow for the possibility that their flaws and stories can endear, inspire and move us, just like those of men.

(HBO) DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) A decade has passed on screen since Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and millions of people have fallen prey to a lethal virus, leaving survivors to cobble together a society in the ruins of San Francisco, where Dreyfus (Gary Oldman), the former police chief, is in charge. But across the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County, the upright-walking chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his team have built their own civilization, complete with distinctive wooden architecture, domesticated horses, a sophisticated sign language and an education system overseen by the orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). But when the humans ask to encroach on their territory to build a hydroelectric station, the alarms are sounded  and schisms formed. Its a satisfying movie and an example  a dispiritingly rare one these days  of what mainstream Hollywood filmmaking can still achieve, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about Matt Reevess Oscar nominee for best achievement in visual effects. That we have progressed from Rise only as far as Dawn suggests many future sequels, which may, in this case, be a source of hope as well as dread, provided that civilization doesnt collapse in the meantime.",2015-05-23T05:00:11+0000

The Italian Government by this provocative attack on the Dual Monarchy has also broken without right or reason the alliance with Germany. The loyal relation existing according to treaty between Austria-Hungary and the German Empire which has been still more firmly welded by comradeship in arms has remained uninjured by the defection of the third ally and her desertion to the enemies camp. The German Ambassador, Prince Blow, has therefore received instructions to leave Rome conjointly with the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Baron Macchio. Prince Blow left Rome this evening at 9.45. The Prussian Minister to the Vatican and the Bavarian Ministers to the Quirinal and the Vatican left by the same train.  The New York Herald, European Edition, May 25, 1915",2015-05-24T11:51:10+0000

Christian Roberts plays Denham, the arrogant teenager who incites Thackerays latest classroom edict: If the students want to be treated as the adults they are about to become, they must act like adults. A nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times about James Clavells drama.

Without it, horror fiction would be a paltry thing, a tattered coat upon a stick or, perhaps, a ragged, bloody, roughly handled zombie action figure for gullible children. That, of course, is what contemporary horror actually is, most of the time. For some writers, though, the damned soul does sometimes clap its hands and sing. Clive Barker knows the tune, and in his new novel, THE SCARLET GOSPELS (St. Martins, $26.99), he belts it out as rapturously as an Irish tenor crooning Danny Boy. Better than half the action of The Scarlet Gospels takes place in hell, where Barker is clearly very much at home. His descriptions of the underworld often recall the grotesque tableaus of Hieronymus Bosch, but are at other times weirdly hushed and lyrical: The sky contained neither sun, nor stars, which was predictable enough, but what it did contain was a stone the size of a small planet. The stone reached high above the immense landscape that spread out below, and it threw off fissures like lightning bolts, through which brightness poured. The effect upon the vast panorama was uncanny. In Barkers work, beauty and evil are an old married couple, living together comfortably, even serenely, with no secrets left from one another.",2015-05-27T09:30:08+0000

Im not sure what that means, but the police werent involved, nothing made the news, all the people involved kept their jobs. To my knowledge, this young woman told me and one other colleague. I kept the secret to myself for the last seven years until the other night. I let slip to a journalist friend the very basics of what happened, and now I'm being asked for contacts who can confirm that it happened. The candidate I worked for is running again. I still support the candidate, and I do not want the opponent in office. On the other hand, I am aghast that the organization would cover up such a heinous crime. Im ashamed of myself for not saying anything at the time. Thinking about it makes me feel physically ill. Do I have any obligation to disclose information to this journalist friend? Would I be doing right for the country? For the victim? I signed a nondisclosure agreement when I went to work for the campaign  would leaking information about this to the press put me in any potential legal trouble?

The President attributed the attitude of the isolationists to good faith but lack of interest or knowledge.

Grant painted on its round top and pictures of a standing, sexy woman on each side of its square base.

The government forces quick retreat from the small city of Ariha left insurgents celebrating in the streets and made it appear increasingly unlikely that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad would retake the provincial capital, also called Idlib, as officials vowed to do when it fell to insurgents two months ago. The government is also facing advances by the Islamic State, which seized the central desert city of Palmyra last week.

(13) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA: ANDRIS NELSONS INAUGURAL CONCERT Mr. Nelsons (above), the Latvian conductor, makes his debut as the ensembles music director in this program of Wagnerian and Italian verismo repertory, featuring his wife, the soprano Kristine Opolais, and the German tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Among the works in this Great Performances presentation, taped in September, are Wagners Tannhuser overture, which Mr. Nelsons has credited with inspiring him at the age of 5 to pursue a life in music. As he walked to the podium on Saturday he was greeted with a long, rousing ovation; many people were on their feet, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times in his review of that concert. But the best indication that Mr. Nelsons was a strong choice for the job was the superb playing of the musicians of this great orchestra, especially in, of all things, Respighis familiar 1924 symphonic poem, Pines of Rome. If you are going to conclude an important inaugural concert with a shameless showpiece, well, picking this skillfully written, dazzlingly orchestrated and colorful score was the way to go. Mr. Nelsons drew a glittering, textured and cinematic account of that 20-minute work from his players. ",2015-05-29T05:00:11+0000

Instead, Moraes says, develop your core strength.

Bulls can weigh up to 2,200 pounds and are bred for their explosive leaps and midair spins. Dance with the bull, advises Moraes, 45, who retired in 2008 and now scouts talent (bovine and human) and runs events for the P.B.R. in his native Brazil.

I crumpled to the floor and started crying. Santat has illustrated other peoples books for a long time (he previously hit the list as the illustrator for Ahmet Zappas Because Im Your Dad, in 2013), but The Adventures of Beekle is just the second story hes written on his own. He almost chose not to, he told Publishers Weekly: Five years ago he had a chance to join Google, drawing doodles for the home page. Should I take this job and make money to support my family, he asked himself, or should I chase my dream? Turning Google down, he continued, motivated me to use the other side of my creative brain, to write more. It paid off. Among the highlights of Santats February, according to his Tumblr account, was outselling 50 Shades of Grey (for a brief moment) and receiving the following Valentines newsletter from his 9-year-old son, Alek: Dan Santat has just won his amazing Caldecott award. Many people think that Dan is known around the world.",2015-05-29T15:46:08+0000

The installation represents the return of Excursus to public view almost 17 years after its premiere at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea, where it became a kind of touchstone of Mr. Irwins working methods.
