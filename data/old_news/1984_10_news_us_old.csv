Before yielding to Hernandez in the ninth, Wilcox threw 108 pitches, 78 of them strikes, despite the pain of a chronic arthritic condition in his right shoulder.

There were lessons with Ivan Galamian and Josef Gingold, a scholarship to Juilliard, and master classes with Jascha Heifetz. And by the time he entered the Tchaikovsky, he had already won 10 smaller-scale violin competitions and had even taken the top prize at a local piano contest.

No one will be asleep when the next stage of the campaign begins in Louisville with the first televised Presidential debate.","Does your side have any rabbits, a Mondale adviser was asked not long ago, to pull out of the hat?

Almost all of the short stories in the author's three collections are set in semi-industrial depressed American towns. Our reviewer, Irving Howe, described Raymond Carver's characters as ''plebeian loners struggling for speech.'' Mr. Howe said that the stories in the most recent collection, ''Cathedral,'' first published last year, are ''very skillful within their narrow limits, written within a dry intensity and moving, at their climaxes, from the commonplace to the unnerving. At his best he is probing, as many American writers have done before, the waste and destructiveness that prevail beneath the affluence of American life.'' LIGHT, by Eva Figes. (Ballantine, $2.95.) This novella concerns one summer's day in the life of the great Impressionist painter Claude Monet. As experimental fiction, ''Light'' does not tell its story conventionally. ''It alludes to dramatic events beyond the immediate frame of the narrative itself,'' our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, wrote last year. ''Technique is all or nearly all in this fastidiously wrought work. Its prose is unhurried, richly descriptive, rarely ornamental or excessive - indeed, a kind of Impressionism with words.''",1984-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Given the public's expectations of what constitutes an innovative musical, it's easy to understand why many who might have liked the show shied away from it.

Obviously the list must begin with Jacopo Peri's legendary ''Dafne'' (1597), which holds an enviable position as the first true opera in history. It also happens to be unchallengeable as to artistic worth because the score has never been found. In that respect, Peri is as fortunate an immortal as the Greek sculptor Phidias, none of whose pieces has ever turned up and whose renown rests entirely on copies by Roman artists and on descriptions of his works by ancient critics. More tangibly, Monteverdi's first opera, ''La Favola d'Orfeo,'' is an early masterpiece that cannot be denied a place on the honor roll. Nor can Gluck's reform opera, ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' or Wagner's even more revolutionary ''Tristan und Isolde,'' or Berg's salute to the decaying Romantic tradition, ''Lulu.''

Senator Hart's failure to win the nomination is old news, of course, but the way he conducted his campaign is not. We can learn from it. When Mr. Hart announced his candidacy in early 1983, he was scarcely a blip in the polls. When he arrived at the Democratic National Convention this summer, he had 1,200 delegates. Sherry Jones, the ''Frontline'' producer, recorded what happened between these two points with as close to an insider's perspective as we are likely to see on television. Her camera had access even from the beginning, filming, as they say, behind closed doors. The result will be seen on Channel 13 Tuesday night at 8.",1984-10-07T05:00:00+0000

That smoke and fire are a constant worry. That the map on the wall will be obscured by graffiti. They also know better than to expect anything better. But better exists, in the form of a 10- car train called Snow White. Snow White is the chef d'oeuvre of the cleaning crews at the 242d Street subway yard. Determined to show New York what a lot of elbow grease can do, they've turned a dirty train into a monument to soap, brooms, paint and polish. Snow White's been running for six weeks now, and is still clean. The passengers, one worker says, ''have more respect for it.'' If the rest of the cars got comparable attention, they'd probably get more respect, too. Now, Robert Kiley, the M.T.A.'s chairman, promises that they will. He proposes hiring 300 new car cleaners, enough to keep about a third of the subway system's cars graffiti-free.

Factories are using capacity that once lay idle, and new business investment is flourishing, adding still more capacity. Real (as against inflation-induced) wages are growing for the first time in years, while productivity is rising. The income tax bite out of every worker's paycheck has been cut by one-fourth and, under the tax-indexing law that takes effect next year, should never again increase because of inflation. Interest rates, though still high, have dropped by more than a third. Building construction is vigorous. The dollar is again the world's strongest currency. And most Americans believe their future is bright. What about the Federal Government's large deficit? The reversal of this country's economic climate from 1980 to 1984 is enough to disprove the theory that large deficits in themselves cause either inflation or recession. Moreover, the deficit is even now shrinking as a result of economic recovery, and in any case growth is the absolute precondition for dealing with the problem.",1984-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Speaking on the eve of Prime Minister Shimon Peres's visit to Washington, the officials said that in exchange for a pullout, Israel would insist on an expanded deployment of United Nations forces in southern Lebanon. (Page A1, Column 2.) South Africa will use its army to support the police in combatting a wave of unrest in recent weeks that has claimed 80 lives in a crackdown on dissent. A police spokesman said army units had been deployed in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg. Moreover, the Minister of Law and Order, Louis Le Grange, said the civilian police would be expanded by 45 percent, apparently an acknowledgement that unrest was unlikely to abate.

Their contribution and that of their colleagues has determined the course taken by art in the second half of the century, both by direct influence and by the rebellions against it - Pop and Minimalism, for instance. But the two artists haven't rested on their laurels: De Kooning, as disclosed by his recent Whitney Museum retrospective, has purged his imagery of grand, juicy gestures, substituting rapid linear marks that hang suspended as if in plasma. Motherwell, on the other hand, has grown more complex - at least that is the impression given by the new collages hanging at Knoedler's, 19 East 70th Street.",1984-10-12T05:00:00+0000

Her husband, Denis, later reported that the bathroom was ''mangled.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) The I.R.A. bombing of the hotel in Brighton was aimed at derailing new efforts to achieve a settlement in Northern Ireland, according to British and Irish politicians.

It is a mark of his genius that he was eventually able to convince the demons that were frolicking about within him that they would be better off submitting themselves to the laws of his art. Cezanne arrived at the astonishing clarity and volume of his mature work not by smothering his tempestuous, unpredictable, doubting nature, but by finding a language in which the irrationality and violence within him could breathe.

When she is 22, her father, nicknamed Hob, dies suddenly, leaving among his papers a letter urging her to find her brother. She does not act on her father's request, nor does she come to terms with the memories of her childhood, until she is 30; then her life is disrupted by another disaster. This last twist of fate occurs when she is living in Burlington, Vt. - it is appropriate that this somber novel be set in that cold, quiet northern town - and is the novel's central event. It compels Julie to try to understand and rise above the pain of loss that threatens to paralyze both her and her lover, Michael Gardener. Slowly, as Julie looks back on the events of her childhood, then forward to her relationship with Michael, a lifetime's tangle of emotions is unraveled. But it not until the novel's nightmarish conclusion that Julie learns how to overcome her grief and thereby save herself. T. Alan Broughton, the author of three previous novels and five books of poetry, has invested his fourth novel with a poet's sensibility. ''Hob's Daughter'' is skillfully and affectingly written; it is ''about safety, about the known fragments bobbing on the surface of a dark sea, but above all about that grace we hope pervades in all: love.''-",1984-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Reporters understand they cannot know all the answers, but act as if entitled to them. As the campaign of 1984 enters its final weeks, it is increasingly evident that something extraordinary has happened to the relationship between President Reagan and the press. It is not simply that the level of friction is high, for that is typical of an election year. What is now clear is that Mr. Reagan has ignored some of the unstated ground rules under which reporters have traditionally covered the Presidency.

In any case, whatever the actual level of hostility to Jews that I was witnessing, it was vastly exacerbated in my mind by the threatening existence of Nazism and the near absence among the men I worked with 14 hours a day of any comprehension of what Nazism meant - we were fighting Germany essentially because she had allied herself with the Japanese who had attacked us at Pearl Harbor.",1984-10-14T05:00:00+0000

It was a fitting climax to China's rehabilitation of the sage whose teachings in the 6th and 5th centuries B.C. came to permeate the fabric of Chinese civilization. During the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, he was made the historical scapegoat of the Maoists, vilified as the ''stinking reactionary'' who stood for all the vestiges of the past that the Communists vowed to eradicate. After the leftist Defense Minister Lin Biao botched a plot in 1971 to overthrow Mao Zedong and was killed trying to flee the country, the Maoists posthumously insulted the traitor by coining a slogan to ''criticize Lin Biao and Confucius,'' as if one deserved no better than the other. Since Chairman Mao's death in 1976, however, the new leadership has decided that China could use more of the virtues that Confucius espoused, such as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and fidelity. His emphasis on courtesy and ethics has been echoed in Peking's campaign to promote the ''four beauties'' - language, heart, behavior and environment - among Chinese whose manners have grown slovenly under communism. The Confucian respect for education has become important as China tries to restore the dignity of its intellectuals, who were persecuted for knowing too much and who are needed now to supply the brainpower for the modernization drive.",1984-10-14T05:00:00+0000

It is Gremin's only appearance in the opera but with a few musical strokes Tchaikovsky puts before us, not an operatic bass, but a palpable, three-dimensional human being. Gremin, who describes himself wryly as ''a gray-haired warrior,'' blissfully describes his happiness and is gone, leaving Onegin and Tatyana to play out their tragedy of missed romantic opportunities.",1984-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Is it because of some intrinsic inferiority to other light-classical genres such as the Viennese operetta and Gilbert and Sullivan? Or is the American musical simply founded on vocal traditions that do not allow it to adjust easily to opera surroundings? I found myself mulling over that and related questions the other evening during the New York City Opera's ambitious new production of ''Sweeney Todd,'' Stephen Sondheim's Broadway hit of five seasons ago. I came down, somewhat tentatively, on the side of incompatible vocal traditions, but I grant that the issue is a complicated one.",1984-10-21T05:00:00+0000

''But as I went on in my research,'' he explained in an interview, ''I became struck with the relevance to the present day.'' His goal was to permit people to see ''what the process of diplomacy was really like, how much personal pride and ambition got in the way, how internal politics affected external policy and the importance of military planning on events.'' To this veteran diplomat and historian, only a handful of the Russian and French leaders were ''able to discern the long-term effects of their decisions, particularly in the military field.'' He called attention to the Russian General Staff's planning paper in the book's appendix as an example of how leaders ''locked themselves into an imaginary war to such an extent that it became quite real.'' He worries about today's leaders making an even more catastrophic error in building nuclear forces for deterrence, but at the same time, thinking and planning to fight and win nuclear wars. But he acknowledges an important difference between then and now in this respect. Then, the generals made ''the crazy plans.'' Today, civilian strategists provide the dangerously imaginary scenarios akin to the mobilization plans for World War I. ''Maybe,'' he reflected, ''the military learned more than the civilians. Perhaps the military now understands there are unlikely to be any victors in any international conflict, whereas many political leaders don't think that at all as they make their appeals to the hard-line constituency.''",1984-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Collins gently instructs an imagined 30-year-old daughter (Miss Collins is not married) in the ways of the corporate world and, not so incidentally, in relations between the sexes. To Miss Collins, a senior editor of the Harvard Business Review, success is a matter of managing the personal relationships that shape every workplace. Demonstrating her own mastery of ''this crucial human element of business,'' she guides the daughter, Amanda, through several private and professional crises, notably an unhappy love affair and an unfortunate corporate takeover. She teaches by example, using anecdotes from her own life as object lessons; a tennis match is used to show how to be appropriately subordinate to a boss without becoming subservient. Some readers, however, may find the author's lessons a bit pat, her tone somewhat cloying and her portrait of a mother and daughter too good to be true. In a disclaimer, Miss Collins notes that she has changed names and places in the interests of privacy and ''accurately portrays business behavior'' - not actual business people. But true or not, this book has some no-nonsense advice for working women. -",1984-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Menus should be devised with logic and an awareness of setting in mind, not mere ostentation.

The measure, a two-paragraph amendment to city contracts, was approved unanimously at 9:30 P.M. The board's vote applied to 61 city contracts, but the administration of Mayor Koch intends to extend its applications to any company or agency that provides goods or services to New York City. Last month, a State Supreme Court justice declared unconstitutional a mayoral order extending to city contractors job protection for homosexuals. The judge, Alvin F. Klein, found that the Mayor ''had impermissibly invaded the legislative domain'' by issuing the order. John P. Hale, a lawyer for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, which was among the parties to the lawsuit that led to Judge Klein's ruling, had contended earlier in the day that the board did not have any more authority than the Mayor to implement such an anti-bias measure. He said that if the board were to approve the measure, the archdiocese would sue the city again and seek to recover its legal expenses. The proposed addition to city contracts states: ''In addition to and not in substitution for any other requirement of this agreement, the contractor agrees that it will not refuse to hire or employ, nor bar or discharge from employment, nor discriminate against any persons in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, sexual orientation and affectional preference.",1984-10-26T05:00:00+0000

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced one of President Francois Mitterrand's bodyguards for planting explosives at the French Ambassador's home to test Scotland Yard's detection skills. While Mr. Mitterrand was in southwest England as part of his state visit to celebrate 80 years of Anglo-French solidarity, the French Embassy responded that the whole thing had been a ''regrettable misunderstanding.''

(Page 1, Column 6.) Mehmet Ali Agca, the central figure in the conspiracy case in the attempted murder of Pope John Paul II, has partly recanted his testimony about another purported plot, to kill Lech Walesa, the founder of the Polish union Solidarity. But Mr. Agca's testimony included a wealth of details, many of which were independently corroborated by investigating magistrates. (1:4-6.)",1984-10-27T05:00:00+0000

The re'll be no reductions, says Britain's Department of Transportation, unless the Justice Department certifies in advance that the proposed fares are legal under America's antitrust laws.",What a touching concern for legalities. The Thatcher Government knows full well that there won't be any antitrust suit objecting to these fare reductions. Its real purpose is to show displeasure with the Justice Department's investigation of charges that British carriers helped drive low-fare Laker Airlines out of business in 1982. It may be too much to expect the British Government to support an American antitrust action in which British Airways may be one of the defendants. But surely the Tories can find a way to protest that is more consistent with their free-market principles.,1984-10-27T05:00:00+0000

YES AND NO,"No one is yet certain whether it actually represented a significant breakthrough in fashion history or whether it merely provided comic relief from the boredom of the Paris spring collections which just came to a close. Nevertheless, the 1984 Paris showings, as well as those in London the previous week, will go down in the collective fashion memory as the time when men were first seen wearing skirts on the major runways of Europe. The phenomenon, as it was called, appeared primarily in collections of young designers who create clothing for both men and women: the Body Map show in London, the Jean-Paul Gaultier show in Paris. But even at Chanel, which does not make men's clothes and does not have a young designer, a man appeared in a Chanel suit. He did not, however, wear a skirt. He wore, for the sake of propriety, side-button pants. For some, the wearing of skirts by men became an important issue. ''It is the most important thing to happen in fashion in the past 20 years!'' announced Daniel Hechter, the French designer, at a dinner he gave one night in his apartment on Avenue Foch. ''I remember when it was scandal for women to wear pants,'' he declared. Mr. Hechter was one of the first to design pants for women. The Gaultier show caused the most controversy. Some of the male models wore plaid skirts and open-toed platform basketball sneakers. Other outfits pushed the phenomenon to its limits, with men wearing sarongs and tank tops or see-through harem pants.",1984-10-27T05:00:00+0000

Despite these punishments, there were still a few people who helped Jews even after 1939. . . . During the earlier period, the most common form of help was the purchase of extra amounts of food, since Jews were no longer allowed to shop. . . . Herr Otto, still a grocer today, described how Frau Schmidt . . . ''suddenly one day asked for two pounds of butter instead of her usual one. I knew of course that the extra pound was for the Mandels who lived upstairs.'' The Jewish families, digging into their savings, paid for the purchased goods themselves. Later some of them began bartering household items and sold off their possessions as the financial need arose. Throughout the thirties, Christina and her brother Robert, owners of the bakery, continued baking challah on Friday, which she secretly delivered to Jewish customers late at night. She continued this practice until 1941 . . . whenever she could, so that ''they could still celebrate the Friday night meal.'' Frau Kramer described how her mother would buy extra rolls and when she walked by the homes of certain Jews, she would throw them through a window left open for that purpose.",From ''Victims and Neighbors.'',1984-10-28T05:00:00+0000

In this World War I Army story that takes the reader into the trenches, the author lined up Company K's 113 officers and men and gave to each, round-robin fashion, a bit of his novel to tell. When ''Company K'' came out 51 years ago, Harold Strauss said in The Book Review that March had gone ''far beyond the confines of a novel; at a single stroke he invented and perfected a new form. No man could write the gigantic story that lies behind 'Company K,' but William March, by a brilliant refinement of form, has given us its essence and its broad sweep, flashes of its intensity and rich variety.'' THE ANATOMY LESSON, by Philip Roth. (Fawcett Crest, $3.95.) The third of Mr. Roth's novels starring the novelist Nathan Zuckerman - following ''The Ghost Writer'' and ''Zuckerman Unbound'' - was published in hard covers last year. Zuckerman by now is middle-aged, devoid of ideas, emotionally exhausted and in constant pain. Robert Kiely, our reviewer, said: ''Roth has written, not a contemporary defense of fiction or poetry, but of the writer as bankrupt. Bereft of ideas, subject matter and self-confidence, the writer is nonetheless bound to his profession as he is to his own body.''",1984-10-28T05:00:00+0000

The hero, Mark Kessler, is a Long Island clammer, a loner in his mid-30's who has been disowned by his father, a successful plastic surgeon. After Kessler, in self-defense, kills a hunter who terrorizes birds on the marsh preserve, he finds that he is without remorse. Later, smitten by anomie and craving excitement, he begins killing for sport and his own curious sense of self-righteousness, taking five victims in all. As the bodies are discovered, a reward is offered and soon the police and a large group of bounty hunters arrive at Kessler's icebound retreat. With diving equipment and underwater weapons, Kessler descends to the topsy-turvy world beneath the ice of Great South Bay to make his last stand. His cunning and nature's inexorable process - a freezing wind and thin ice - defeat the bounty hunters and put them to rout. And then, by an act of will, Kessler seals his fate and decides who will get the bounty. Mr. Leonard's handling of the climax is superb; the imagery is sharp and brilliant; the writing is always economical and suspenseful. The major characters - Kessler, Ellen Smith, a girl of 14 whom he treats as a daughter, and her father, who is killed by Kessler for turning Ellen into a prostitute - are well- rounded and believable, and their behavior effortlessly and naturally propels the plot along its harrowing course. Mr. Leonard presents a vision of man as a natural hunter and killer, which is set against the novel's underlying theme of greed and retribution.",1984-10-28T05:00:00+0000

''The handling of the manual, the conduct of the whole covert program against Nicaragua, raise very serious questions about the credibility and ability of the agency,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and member of the Select Committee on Intelligence. ''The seriousness of this goes way beyond the question of the manual.''",1984-10-28T05:00:00+0000

Those districts that have met the goal, set in an agreement among Mayor Koch, the City Council, the Board of Estimate and the Board of Education, did so at the expense of other programs, their officials say. The financing, a result of last spring's negotiations over the city budget, has led to small reductions in first-grade class sizes throughout the city. But school officials acknowledge that they have not met their own goal of bringing first grades - where most children learn to read and often need individual attention - down to a district average of 25 students in each of the 32 community school districts. ''Reduced first-grade class size was something everybody agreed to,'' said Stanley Litow, an official of the Educational Priorities Panel, a civic group of parents and educational organizations. ''The reality is that though it got reduced, it didn't happen in the dramatic way everybody expected.'' He and other critics blamed top school officials, saying that the officials sent mixed signals to community school districts and handled budget negotiations last spring in an unsophisticated fashion. Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones cited a number of factors, including lack of space for more classrooms in some districts and a larger number of first graders than expected.",1984-10-29T05:00:00+0000

Actually, what has driven so many young peoPaul N. McCloskey Jr., former Republican Representative from California, challenged President Richard M. Nixon in 1972 Republican primaries after breaking with him over his Vietnam War policy. ple to register as Republicans is the Democrats' embrace of the ''old'' politics of Walter F. Mondale. What hope is there for young people in a Democratic Party headed by one of the remaining ''old pols'' of our time - a traditional Democrat who thinks his first obligation is to leaders of organized labor and his second obligation to every entitlement program conceived by Lyndon B. Johnson's ''Great Society'' crusade of the mid-1960's - programs for which Mr. Mondale was an enthusiastic co-author in the Senate and that now account for more than half the Federal deficit? These programs, with built-in incentives for profligacy, waste and idleness, have perhaps mortgaged the future economic security of young Americans more than any other age group. These voters can listen to Mr. Mondale's campaign promises with certainty that booming budget deficits could only increase under his leadership.",1984-10-30T05:00:00+0000
