us,Film: A Cuban 'Uncle Tom's Cabin',"""THE Other Francisco"" the 1975 Cuban film that opened yesterday at the Jean Renoir Cinema, is an unusually fresh example of the sort of didactic movie making that often leaves a lot to be desired. Directed by Sergio Giral, ""The Other Francisco"" is both an adaptation of Anselmo Suarez Romero's ""Francisco,"" a Cuban antislavery novel written before ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" as well as a critique of the novel and of the methods and motives of 19th-century Cuban liberals and abolitionists.Mr. Giral cross-cuts between scenes from the novela sentimental story about a young slave who kills himself when his beloved is taken into the master's bedand scenes that attempt to show, what slavery was really like. There also are interludes in which the novelist discusses the writing of his book, which, he admits, attributes romantic motives to characters who were incapable of romantic notions.Photographed in black-and-white that has the quality of newsreel battle footage, the film both appreciates the novel's abolitionist sentiments and analyzes the distortions. Slaves, the movie says, were hardly as docile and passive as the novelist pictured. They might commit suicide to escape the system but never because of broken hearts. Women slaves were treated as badly as the men. Although Cuban liberals were against slavery, they were apprehensive about full independence from Spain, fearing a black-majority rule.""The Other Francisco,"" which begins the Renoir Cinema's retrospective of Cuban films (including the superb ""Memories of Underdevelopment""), is a stern, sober, opinionated work. It's also another demonstration of the great vitality of the contemporary Cuban film industry.",1977-07-01T05:00:00+0000

For 285 years it has been part of Massachusetts, but this year the citizens in all six of its small towns voted to quit the commonwealth after a reduction of the legislature from 240 to 160 delegates placed the Vineyard and the neighboring island of Nantucket into a district with Cape Cod and left the 8,000 yearround residents of Martha's Vineyard without a representative of their own. Outside Alley's General Store in West Tisbury, where farmers mingle with Harvard professors, the Vineyard's flag of independencedeep blue with a sun and a seagullhas been snapping. Expressions of outrage can be heard throughout the island: in Edgartown, the Dukes County seat; in Gay Head, a village where 60 descendants of Wampanoag Indians are among the voters; in Oak Bluffs, summer community of gingerbread cottages; in Vineyard Haven, the island's business center, and in Chilmark, home of outspoken Yankees. The islanders are considering offers from other states (even Hawaii has made a bid) to annex the Vineyard if the Massachusetts legislature could be induced to give its consent, and there has even been talk, jocular at first, now more serious, of going it alone as a territory. Two years ago the Vineyard was the setting for the movie Jaws, and money poured in. This year land scenes for Jaws 2 have been filmed on the island, which has helped take minds off what some voters regard as taxation without representation.

Like Little Orphan Annie, Penny, the small heroine of ""The Rescuers,"" is parentless and subject to all sorts of evil designs by people, who fortunately, are so incompetent that they are virtually self-destruct mechanisms.""The Rescuers,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama Two and other theaters, is efficiently short, charming, mildly scary in unimportant ways, and occasionally very funny. It's a perfect show for the very, very young who take their cartoons seriously.The screenplay, based on two stories by Margery Sharp, is principally about the efforts of two do-gooding New York mice, Bernard and Miss Bianca, members of something called the Rescue Aid Society, to rescue Penny after she's been kidnapped by a certain Madame Medusa. The last, who runs Madame Medusa's Pawn Shop Boutique, has stolen the child and whisked her off to Louisiana because Penny is the only person small enough to crawl into a pirate's cave there and retrieve a diamond as big as a baseball.I doubt that even small children will pay too much attention to the story, which, as it should be, is simply the excuse for a series of marvelously improbable adventures. There is, for example, the hectic journey that Bernard, whose voice and something of his personality are supplied by Bob Newhart, and Miss Bianca (voice by Eva Gabor) take to Louisiana via Albatross Air Charter Service. The ""equipment,"" as it's called in timetables, is a very tired albatross named Orville who hasn't yet mastered takeoffs or landings.In the Devil's Bayou in Louisiana there are split-second escapes from Madame Medusa, a fine, flame-haired Gorgon for whom Geraldine Page supplies the voice and comic presence, and encounters with various swamp types, including a dragonfly named Evinrude who runs a local boat service.With periodic timeouts for obligatory songs of an especially forgettable nature, ""The Rescuers"" moves quickly and without fuss from one episode to the next, never creating a sense of any real dread or fear. The animation is pretty in a conventional fashion that may be as fascinating to children as the bold innovations of someone like Ralph Bakshi are to the rest of us.""The Rescuers"" doesn't belong in the same category as the great Disney cartoon features (""Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,"" ""Bambi,"" ""Fantasia"") but it's a reminder of a kind of slickly cheerful, animated entertainment that has become all but extinct.",1977-07-07T05:00:00+0000

In this, the British agreed to build a road that would give Guatemala access to the sea in the north. Britain finally did build a crude road in 1948, but for the Guatemalans the gesture came too late. In Guatemala at the moment, there are no that show Belize's existence.",1977-07-08T05:00:00+0000

Chaucer, Dryden, Wordsworth, Eliot and iouna were all reacting in one way or another the florid, gorgeous poeticism of a previous generation. Wordsworth even invoked Chaucer, hardly his contemporary, as Eliot would later pay homage Dryden, in making his case for language really used by men, plainer and more emphatic language, and against what he called poetic diction.

Among other things, Mr. Herzog visually dazzles us while he's pulling the rug from under our feet.In a Herzog film we have to keep checking what we are hearing against what we're seeing. They are seldom the same things, but forcing us to reconcile contradictions is one of the ways in which he works.""Stroszek,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, is described by Mr. Herzog as a ballad, which is probably as good a way as any to categorize it initially. It's a ""road"" picture. In some distant way it reminds me of ""Easy Rider,"" but it's an ""Easy Rider"" without sentimentality or political paranoia. It's terrifically, spontaneously funny and, just as spontaneously, full of unexpected pathos.""Stroszek"" is the tale of three mismatched friendseach a loserwho set out from Berlin to find El Dorado in northern Wisconsin, in winter, with very little money and hardly any knowledge of English. It would be difficult to imagine three people less fit for such a journey.Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz) is in his 70's, small, frail, modest, a fellow who seems always to be suffering from a chill. Eva (Eva Mattes) is a buxom but none-to-bright Berlin streetwalker, the sort that pimps can beat up and double-cross endlessly without seriously damaging her dogged dependence on them.Most importantly there is Stroszek, played by Bruno S., the Berlin street musician who played the title role in ""Kasper Hauser."" Stroszek, 40-ish, is a worldly innocent who, when we first meet him, seems to be simple-minded. He is being released from prison by a not-unsympathetic warden who warns him to stay out of bars and to try to remember to shave and keep his fly zipped. It's not that Stroszek has tendencies. He simply doesn't pay attention to minor details. Something is missing from Stroszek, but what it is is not intelligence.As an actor, Bruno S. is a found object. Much of the tension of the early scenes of ""Stroszek"" is created by our attempting to fit Bruno S. into some normal scheme of things. Is he acting? Is he following Mr. Herzog's directions like a trained dog? Is he improvising, sometimes with immense wit? I suspect it must be a combination of all three.In whatever way the performance is created, it's an extraordinarily compelling one, and one that is virtually a physical manifestation of what the film is about. The Stroszek we get to know is a compassionate, patient, common-sensical man incapable of rage or physical assertiveness. This small, curious personality is imprisoned within a large, stocky, man-sized body that seems too big for him, a vehicle that can maneuver with only the utmost effort and concentration. When he glances around him, he looks like a child peering apprehensively out of the pilot's seat of a 747.The adventures of these three contemporary pilgrims as they attempt to settle into what they believe to be the American way of life are both bleak and uproariously funny. Eva, who works as a waitressfor a whileand Stroszek, who gets a job as a mechanic, buy a huge mobile home of an indescribably fancy awfulness. Scheitz, who appears to shrink even smaller in the Wisconsin cold, becomes politely disoriented and decides he has discovered the means to measure ""animal magnetism"" by using a conventional ammeter.Constantly working against Mr. Herzog's very cool view of the human condition is not only the humor""Stroszek"" contains one of the shortest, funniest holdups I've ever seen in a moviebut also the physical beauty of the landscapes, the cityscapes and the squalid interiors. This visual lyricism, which at first seems at odds with the subject, eventually becomes a further celebration of Stroszek's survival.That the pilgrims must eventually be disappointed is a foregone conclusion, but the way it happens is anything but predictable. Among the dozens of images in the film I'll remember for a very long time is one near the end of a chicken that can't stop dancing and another of a premature baby, hardly bigger than a man's hand, whose capacity to hang on is nothing less than ferocious. It's this mixture of feelings and attitudes that gives the Herzog works their haunting lives.",1977-07-13T05:00:00+0000

us,'Dr. Moreau' Film Is Creepily Good,"WHAT SOMEONE should always refer to at some point as ""the ???cred mystery of life"" is being interfered with ???gh old style in Don Taylor's creep??? new film ad???ptation of H. G. We???'s ??? novel. ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" The horror movie, which belongs to the man-made-monster subcategory, opened yesterday at the Cine??? and other theaters.The film sticks to its turn-of-the-century period and is beautifully set ??? ???a tropical Pacific i??? (actually St. Crotx without golfers)??? where Dr. Moreau (actually ??? Lancaster with a ???board) continues the invidious experiments that earlier got him tossed out of every medical society from Boston ??? P???t Said. The doctor, like Baron ???kenstein, is positively obs???d with the sacred mystery of l???fe, which ??? wants to control through chromo???.To this end, he has set up his laboratory on a remote ???land where, with the comp???ship of??? a beautiful, now ???, ex-???nlan where named Ma???a (??? Carre???s) and a hired??? named Montgomery (N??? Davenport)??? he injects what appears to be ???re mountain spring water into ???, ??? hyenas, wolves and such.After 11 years of hard work Dr. Moreau has a whole???Island full of near??? that the film calls ""humanimals,"" ??? term that has been trade-marked with an eye??? I suppose to the toy and T-shirt markets. The hu???mals are slow-w???tted, ma??? beasts who walk a???nd on their hi??? legs, m???aco strangers??? but??? with Dr. Moreau, behave with??? the sort of tense overpolit???ness ??? would expect ??? a Friday night ??? designed to allow inmates to meat and get to know their prison guard???.Dr. Moreau might still be carrying on his work, populating the world with his mistakes, ???if there hadn't arrived at the island a shipwrecked sailor named ???dock (Michael York), who had ???ruples about the sacred mystery of life but non??? when it came to grabbing Mar???a, who still remembered a trick or two.This is more or less the plot of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" which, according to my research, was also the general outline of the ???1933 screen adaptation that starred Charles Laughton and was called ""Island of Lost Sou???."" Having neither read the novel nor ???n the earlier film directed by Er???e Kenton??? I feel no sense of loss in the mostly clever foolishness that Mr. Taylor has directed.Mr. Lancaster is a very be???gn madman??? courtly, gentle-mannered, a perfect host to the uninvited guest until Mr. York goes poking around and stirring up trouble with the homemade help. Then, but only then, does the doctor decide he must take ""steps."" That is??? he is forced to begin some new experiments with the younger man.The Island of Dr. Moreau"" is a Saturday night movie that needn't be ashamed to come out the rest of the week. The screenplay, by John Herman Sha???er and A??? Ramrus, sounds as if it would have been fun to write. Though it's never fa???tious, it??? enjoys such extravagances as the doctor's saying, ???""If they [the humanimals] spill just one??? drop of blood, it will drown us all.""The performers display a kind of disciplined intelligence that keeps them from bursting through the style of the film into comic limbo. These include Mr. D???venport as the foreman who, to relax??? listens to an amazingly high-quality recording of ""The Magic Fluts,"" and Richard Baschart as the most intelligent, most p???ce-loving of the human???mals, a follow who winds up like Neville Chamberlaintotally discredited.Most of the work, though, is done by John Chambers, Dan Striepeke and Tom Burman, who designed the makeup, and by Mr. Lancaster and Mr. York, who are steadfast. Miss Carrera is so beautiful she's a scared mystery of life all by herself.""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") contains some mild, very fleeting female nudity and some violence that doesn't dwell on gore more than is necessary in what's supposed to be, after all, a scary movie.",1977-07-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Rose Garden' Limns Dark Borders of Reality,"TO ESCAPEactually, to renaer neutralthe terrors, real and imagined, of this world, Deborah Blake, a pretty, middle-class teen-ager, has created another much more exotic and much more terrifying world that exists just beyond reality. Though she is its ruler, she's also its slave, subject always to the laws and rituals she herself has designed to keep herself in line. At the age of 16, Deborah Blake is a certified schizophrenic.Among the achievements of Anthony Page's screen adaptation of Joanne Greenberg's novel, ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden,"" is our immediate acceptance of Deborah's fantasy world, a desert landscape inhabited by half-naked pagans whose origins could be comic books perused at some preliterate age. Deborah's demons are both ferocious and absurd and never for a moment do we doubt their existence.Unlike ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden"" makes no pitch on behalf of the proposition that the mentaly ill may be more sane and happy than the straights walking around loose outside. Mental illness, it knows, is sad and depressing, full of such breathtaking, manifold possibilities for failure and harm that one always has to be alert. It's exhausting, physically and phychically.""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II, is the carefully realized story of Deborah's treatment at a hospital that is probably better than most but still frightening enough, it would seem to us, to drive even someone who's well-balanced over the edge.There's the male nurse who, to assert his own tenuous superiority over the patients, beats them up at will and, when he's feeling at ease, simply teases them. There are fatuous doctors and patronizing nurses. Mostly though, there are the other patients who insist on imposing their own worldly, surreal views on everyone around them, who slide in and out of temper tantrums, feuds and passionate friendships, who effectively befuddle even the simplest logic. To move among them without a collision is to sail without benefit of a centerboard or rudder.How Deborah, with the help of one remarkable doctor, is eventually able to recognize her own pain and thus come to some kind of terms with her demons is the moving substance of this film that leaves one almost as exhausted as its heroine.Mental illness is always a tricky thing to dramatize, not because it's especially difficult but because it's such an acute form of distress that it exists outside all conventional experience. Mr Page and his screenwriters, Gavin Lambert and Lewis John Carlino, never quite succeed in convincing me that Deborah's triumph has much to do with the world at I know It. Most of us can identify in some fashion with astronauts, pearl divers, pirates and presidents, but madness is difficult to comprehendmaybe we are afraid of comprehending it. Whatever the reason, ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden' is something I can say I admired much more than I really liked.The tone of the film is straightforward, terse, even as it shares with us Deborah's melodramatic visions of secret ceremonies and sacrifices, which suggest she's seen more than one movie on the order of ""King Kong."" Unless you're someone who finds psychotic behavior intrinsically funny, however, you're likely to be ground-down by the ward sequences in which aimlessness and violence are so effectively portrayed you may wish for a weekend pass before the movie's end.Kathleen Quinlan, who had small parts in ""American Graffiti"" and the California problem-picture, ""Life-guard,"" gives a remarkably fine, contained performance as Deborah. There are no mannerisms, no tricks, only a sense of panic barely contained, of intelligence and feeling struggling to break free. Bibi Andersson is almost equally good as the psychiatrist, nobly free of platitudes and mock-doctor self-importance.Among the inmates you'll recognize Signe Hasso, Susan Tyrrell, Diane Varsi (looking very plump) and Sylvia Sidney. They're all colorful and slightly too-much, as I suppose they should be, though Miss Sidney is achingly pathetic as an old lady who, for a brief time, becomes a legend in the ward after she wins her release.",1977-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Outlaw Blues' Are County-Western Type,"Like many junk foods, ""Outlaw Blues,"" which went on sale at neighborhood theaters yesterday, is pleasantly palatable it not especially nutritious. Despite its aura of contrivance, Peter Fonda and the rest of an energetic cast help transform these ""Blues"" into a fairly lighthearted adventure set against the background of the country-and-western music scene.Of course, they make the most of a musical genre that has millions of devoted fans. Mr. Fonda makes his movie debut as a vocalist and guitarist, singing the title tune by John Oates, as well as other plaintive rural ditties by such country salwarts as Lee Clayton and Harlan sanders. But, to the credit of B. W. L. Norton's script, the film also strongly indicates the vicious competition and sleaziness that could lurk behind the glamorous facades of some of the medium's recording giants.Essentially, ""Outlaw Blues"" is a Mack Sennett-like chase with Mr. Fonda, as an ex-convict, in pursuit of James Callahan, playing the ruthless country star who has stolen Mr. Fonda's titular ballad. If our hero is a naive tyro at first, he is soon shown the light by Susan St. James, as a decorative tough cookie wise in the ways of this division of show business. As might be expected, sex and love get into the act.Richard T. Heffron, the director who has focused largely on documentaries, for example ""Fillmore,"" has kept his cast in fairly constant motion in such authentic locales as Huntsville (Ala.) Prison, San Antonio and Austin, Tex., where the chase is centered. As noted, Miss St. James knows a good thing when she sees one, and, using a fracas in which the thieving star is accidentally shot, she proceeds to make a sought-after luminary out of her excon lover.If speeding cars and a speedboat are not particularly original action devices, they are colorful and occasionally funny as our fleeing principals and the police, headed by Buzz Cavanaugh (John Crawford), make their roaring, breakneck rounds through the city and its river.Come to think of it, the athletic cast is broadly oafish or devious in proper tongue-in-cheek style; Peter Fonda manages to be gently appealing and has a pleasant tenor voice, while Miss St. James is convincing as an expert conniver as well as being flip and pretty. ""I've got the last laugh on you,"" Mr. Fonda's ""Outlaw"" sings, which isn't quite true considering his slight saga. But he and his company make it an amiable, lilting, if lightweight, diversion.Although the young fry are certainly accustomed to the type of violent speeding seen in ""Outlaw Blues,"" some raunchy dialogue probably earned it its PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") rating.",1977-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,'Last Beau Geste' Is the Funniest:The Cast,"Marty Feldman, the wild-eyed, cheerfully low-minded English comedian who was indispensable to Mel Brooks's ""Young Frankenstein"" (""Call me Eye-gore"") and Gene Wilder's 'Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother,"" has now spun himself off, so to speak, as the star, director and co-author of his own frontal assault on cinema tradition and sensibility.""The Last Remake of Beau Geste,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, sends up just about everything, including a lot of things you may think you'd forgottensuch as the original Percival Christophere Wren novel, William A. Wellman's 1939 film version with Gary Cooper and all Foreign Legion movies. It also takes an extended dim view of gallantry, heroism, true love and honor while dealing in old husband-young wife jokes, jokes about female breasts, as well as a whole range of similar jokes that are funny primarily because they are in absolutely terrible taste.It is Mr. Feldman's marvelous conceit to cast himself and Michael York as identical twins, the adopted sons of aging Sir Hector Geste (Trevor Howard), who was so angry after his wife died in childbirth, leaving him with an infant daughter, that he took into his home (Geste Manor) a pair of ragamuffins from the Wormwood and Gaul Orphanage. Sir Hector raises Beau (Mr. York) to be a leader of men and poor little Digby (Mr. Feldman) to follow as well as to love his adopted sister, ""the fair Isabel"" (Sinead Cusack), from afar.The arrangement seems to work quite well until the very decrepit Sir Hector returns from a war in the Sudan with a new wife, Flavia, (Ann-Margaret). One night with Flavia and Sir Hector spends the rest of the movie in bed ""alive,"" as the doctor says periodically, ""and dying."" After the famous Geste ""Blue Water diamond"" has been stolen, and the scheming Flavia has asserted her will to take control of the family, Beau and Digby, by separate routes, take off to join the French Foreign Legion.I think I may be telling you somewhat more of the plot than is necessary in an effort to keep from myself describing the film's gags, which are really what it's all about. I am trying not to tell you about Digby's brilliant break from jail with the wholehearted cooperation of the prison guards, and about his later meeting, in a desert mirage, with Gary Cooper in a secene from the Wellman film. Like many of the gags in the film, this latter involves some brilliantly clever crosscutting and results in a rather new image for Cooper.The movie's momentum, like that of 'Blazing Saddles,"" is dependent not at all on any narrative devices and entirely on the individual gags and the performances. Mr. Feldman has surrounded himself with some of the funniest people in the business. They include Mr. Howard; Spike Milligan as Sir Hector's ancient manservant, a fellow who sways like a pendulum when he walks; Peter Ustinov as the sadistic Foreign Legion sergeant, who calls his men ""my little fledermouses,"" and rides a horse that has a pegleg like his own; James Earl Jones as a very Anglicized Arab chieftain, as well as Ann-Margaret and Mr. York, who must play things fairly straight.I'm not sure that Mr. Feldman, as a film's principal comedian, is as much fun as he is when he's part of an antic combination, as he was in both ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother."" It's the nature of his comic personality that he is funniest when he is a member of a gang, adding a surreal visual touch as well as a presence that's slightly menacing because it's so unpredictable. As the staras well as the directorthere are moments when the desparation is apparent.Yet there are so few comedies of this rakish sort that one can't afford to be too particular. Also, one should not overanalyze it or over-report its comic highlights. Its laughs come as much from the shock of discovery as from what's being said or done.""The Last Remake of Beau Geste,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""], contains a lot of explicit sexual and anatomical references that, if they don't go over the heads of youngsters, will probably strike them as the highest form of wit, mostly because they are consistently, often hilariously irreverent.",1977-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Nothing said by the humans for the rest of the movie does anything to raise doubts about that.Speaking in simple idiocies, the characters in ""Orca"" (Latin for whale)chief among them Richard Harris as a fisherman, Charlotte Rampling as a cetologist, Will Sampson as a font of Indian lore, and Keenan Wynn, Bo Derek and Peter Hooten as various forms of whale fodder  proceed on a doomed course.It begins when Mr. Harris, hoping to pay off the mortgage on his boat by capturing a killer whale, manages instead to mortally maim a pregnant female of the species. Such whales, the audience has been informed, are monogamous. The bereaved male then proceeds to stalk Mr. Harris and to challenge him to a duel.Before the finale amid the ice floes off Labrador, several people have been Killed, one has lost a leg, a few boats have been sunk, a house has been destroyed and a fuel dump has gone up in flames.The finale is chiefly notable for diverting the audience's attention from the action by raising the possibility that Miss Rampling concealed a couturier and a makeup expert aboard Mr. Harris's boat en route to the showdown.The outset of ""Orca"" is marked by some lyrical and touching scenes involving killer whales. But thereafter this movie offers nothing but total immersion in the ridiculous.""Orca's"" PG rating (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") is probably attributable to a goriness that revolts even its characters, and not to the single rapid scene of the attractive, carefully draped Bo Derek in bed with Peter Hooten nor to some mild expletivs.",1977-07-16T05:00:00+0000

I doubt that this aim has been achievedif only because Stalinism was marked so distinctively by the personality of the great tyrant that it is difficult to see any basis for comparison with any his imitators. This is, however, of little importance. The conference fully justified itself by producing excellent studies mainly directed toward four themes: the link between Marxism and Stalinism; the extent, if any, to which Stalinism was a heritage of Lenin; aspects of Stalinism as it developed in Russia; and the transplantation of Stalin's model to the countries of Eastern Europe that fell under Soviet rule.",1977-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Macy's, too, thought it was an idea whose time had come. The store has set up a large platform in the middle of its ninthfloor furniture department as a showcase for Mr. West's designs. The fabrics here are painted in bold arcs or diagonals of color; others are what is known, when the work is done on wood, as fantasy finishes. That is, he paints fabrics to resemble lapis or malachite or wood burl. He even paints fabrics to resemble suede or cotton sateen. Why bother? The depth, Mr. West insists. You get effects of shadow and depth you can't get otherwise. The platform setting includes modular seating covered with Mr. West's strokes of the brush, as well as a round table cover, a screen, director's chairs and pillows. Unless you buy something off the platform, everything is customordered through Macy's decorating department. The fabrics are $25 a yard; the modular seating units are $300 for an ottoman, $375 for an armless seat, and $450 for a corner seat.

Born in Kingfield, Me., in 1858, Mrs. Emmons spent almost every summer there until she died in 1937. Over the decades, she recorded on hundreds of glass plates the serene and timeless scenes of summer  children fishing and wading, outdoor picnics and indoor chores, vistas sea, mountains and woods, and everywhere the classic, nonon sense look of the local farm and town folk. Though Mrs. Emmons exhibited her work and occasionally sold prints (priced from $2.50 to $13), she was little known beyond the circles of a few New England camera clubs; when she died, her photographs virtually disappeared with her. But in 1975, another native of Maine, Marius B. Peladeau, tracked down Mrs. Emmons nephew and acquired his collection of more than 1,100 prints and almost 100 glass negatives. A selection of these will appear in Mr. Peladeaus book, Chanso netta, to be published in September by Maine Antique Digest, and will be put on exhibition at the Neikrug Gallery in New York until late fall.

Surely there must have been a better way.Since sex, at least under optimum conditions, is no laughing matter, and since comedy isn't often erotic, Mr. Nathan's brainstorm turns out to be a losing propositioneven though, according to Bruce Kimmel's screenplay, the movie-within-a-movie knocks 'em dead and saves the day.Mr. Kimmel is something of a quadruple threat, since he has also composed a tuneless score (sample lyric: ""Gotta sing, gotta dance/While I'm taking off my pants""), co-directed with Mark Haggard (on a $200,000 budget during two weeks' time, though the finished product looks considerably more fly-by-night than the figures would indicate), and cast himself in the third lead, as a fledgling director whose bashfulness borders on idiocy.At the other end of the acting spectrum is Miss Williams.

us,'Spy Who Loved' A Bit Long on Bond,"DURING THE COURSE OF ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" James Bond vanquishes an amphibious building that looks like a giant spider, a 7 foot 2 inch villain with metal fangs, hundreds of hapless extras and one very beautiful broad, but he hardly ever comes to grips with his most insidious adversary, the James Bond formula.The same conventions that have provided 10 Bond movies with their patent pizazz also serve as a straitjacket, and these days a Bond film is interesting only insofar as it quietly subverts the series' old tricks. Happily, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" has its share of self-mockerynot enough for a full-scale send-up, but enough to give shopworn old 007 a shot in the arm.The motivating sentiment behind the Bond movies has always been envy: the viewer, poor slob, is expected to covet Bond's women, admire his elaborate playthings and marvel at his ability to chase through the desert in evening clothes without getting dusty. Fifteen years ago, at the time of ""Dr. No,"" this sort of thing was a great deal more effective than it is today, because the notion was new and the gadgets could be genuinely dazzling. But by now Bond fans have seen so many fast cars and floozies come and go that they may be almost as jaded as James himself.Almost, but not quite: Roger Moore is so enjoyably unflappable that you sometimes have to look closely to make sure he's still breathing. Presented with a fabulous new white Lotus, he drives off impatiently without even examining the car's special accessories (as it turns out, the Lotus can swim). Seduced by a conniving cutie, he looks desperately bored.Mr. Moore has the anonymous aplomb of a male modelappropriate, because the film is littered with trademark-bearing merchandise  and he seems incapable of bringing much individualized zest to the role. But his exaggerated composure amounts to a kind of backhanded liveliness. Though Mr. Moore doesn't compromise the character, he makes it amusingly clear that hedonism isn't all it's cracked up to be.The plot this time, which bears no resemblance to that of Ian Fleming's novel, features Curt Jurgens as a shipping magnate determined to destroy the world and Barbara Bach as a Rusian agent who grudgingly joins forces with Bond to pole-ax this scheme. Miss Bach is spectacular but a little dim, even by Bond standards; certainly she makes no sense as a master spy who is almost (but not quite) as ingenious as 007 himself.In all fairness, Miss Bach's is an impossible role: Beauty and brains needn't be incompatible, but maintaining the requisite level of pulchritude of a Bond heroine is such a full-time job that it precludes any other work more strenuous than, say, watching Bond sip his very dry martini (shaken, not stirred).The film moves along at a serviceable clip, but it seems half an hour too long, thanks to the obligatory shoot-'em-up conclusion, filmed on the largest sound-stage in the world, but nevertheless the dullest sequence here. Bond's final blowout, however lavishly produced, has long since gotten to be old hat, and besides, it's the attention to smaller details that has helped the series maintain its high gloss.The theme song, sung by Carly Simon, ranks with Paul McCartney's theme from ""Live and Let Die"" as one of the most delightful surprises the series has had to offereven if it is accompanied by footage of a naked woman, in silhouette, doing silly calisthenics on the barrel of an enormous gun.""The Spy Who Loved Me"" has a PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") rating even though Bond indulges in his favorite means of exercise a little more listlessly than usual. A number of extras are gunned down almost bloodlessly, and arch-villain Curt Jurgens feeds his secretary to a shark.",1977-07-28T05:00:00+0000

It seems less popular now, along with so much pictorial sentimental music of the turn of the century, and in this case at least that's a great pity. For this is lovely music, crafted with exact care and invariably capable of making a fresh effect. The new Andrew DavisNew Philharrnonia disk is about as fine as any of its competitors. Partly that's due to Mr. Davis (a promising younger British conductor and no relation to Colin Davis) and the excellence of the playing and recording. But it's also due to Elisabeth Soderstrom the superb Swedish soprano who sings here in Grieg's native Norwegian. Miss Stiderstrom, an artist of refined quality, with a demurely sensual soprano, has never made a big American reputation, and at this stage of her career some of the major operatic parts would tax her. Here she sounds technically comfortable, and her phrasing and sensitivity are really quite wonderful.
