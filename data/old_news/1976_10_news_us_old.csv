us,"Visconti's 'Ossessione,' at Tully Film Festival In First 35-mm. Version, Initiated Neo-Realism","Although there are almost as many definitions of Italian neo-Realism as there are Italian neo-Realist films, Luchino Visconti's first feature, ""Ossessione,"" made in 1942, is generally accepted as having begun the movement whose name was later applied to the work of Antonioni, Rossellini, De Sica and others.The film, which will be presented today at 3 P.M. at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall and again on Tuesday at 6:15 P.M., is being shown here in a 35-mm. print for the first time. Earlier showings in the United States had been prohibited because Mr. Visconti had, without permission, helped himself to James M. Cain's novel, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" the rights to which were owned by M-G-M, the studio that later filmed it in 1946 with John Garfield and Lana Turner under Tay Garnett's direction.Comparing the Visconti ""Ossessione"" with the Garnett ""Postman"" is to stand a production of ""Traviata"" next to a McDonald's television commercial, which is not meant to underrate the American film that is as effectively steamy, tough and terse as the Hollywood law allowed in those days.Mr. Visconti follows with remarkable fidelity the Cain story about the handsome young drifter and the youngish wife who, driven by their sexual passion and greed, murder the woman's old husband to get his money and his business, a combination hamburger stand and filling station.""Ossessione"" today looks to be an extraordinarily majestic, elegant and romantic movie to have started anything labeled neo-Realism. There is even something grand about that bleakness of the Italiian landscapes, to say nothing of the mood. When the illicit lovers, Gino (Massimo Girotti) and Giovanna (Clara Calamai), are exchanging lustful glances at the dinner table, the soundtrack rumbles with the sounds of distant thunder and frantic cries of caged farm animals. Under these circumstances, one is disappointed that the characters don't sing.""Ossessione,"" which also began the late Mr. Visconti's remarkable film career, may be slow-going to the uninitiated, but its historical importance is not to be denied.",1976-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Tanner's 'Jonah' a Cerebral Film,"All but two of the characters in Alain Tanner's witty, cerebrally playful new Swiss film, ""Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000,"" are French-speaking Swiss. The other two are French citizens who live just over the border in France. Yet each of the characters is, in his or her own way, as surrounded as Switzerland, hemmed in, denied access to something essential.Max (Jean-Luc Bideau), a former political activist, no longer writes for his newspaper. Since 1968 he has worked as a proofreader. Marco (Jacques Denis) is a teacher of history, but his methods are so bizarre that he keeps getting bounced from one school after another. Marie (Miou-Miou) is a cashier in a Geneva supermarket who, being French, is not allowed to sleep in Switzerland. Mathieu (Rufus), fired from his job as a printer because of his union activities, returns to the land as a farm helper.""Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000"" is less the story of nine friends and acquaintances than a highly comic, politicized accounting of their states of mind and their talk. They are surrounded and hemmed in, all right, but they have not been anesthetized by mediocrity into dreamless boredom. They rant and they carry on, like Charles (Raymond Bussires), the retired railroad engineer for whom Marie steals provisions from the supermarket.At one point, Charles recalls the difference between riding on a train and sitting in the engineer's cab. ""When you are a passenger,"" he says, ""the landscape slides past you. When you are the engineer, you are always entering it, approaching that point where the rails meet, but they always open up for you.""""Jonah"" is Mr. Tanner's fifth film to be released in this country, and like his two best films (""La Salamandre"" and ""The Middle of the World""), it has a screenplay written by him in collaboration with John Berger, the English novelist and critic. They make one of the most interesting film-making teams in Europe today.Their line is Marxist, but their method is exuberantly humane, always aware of the comic aspects to the accommodations being made by characters who, in Mr. Tanner's words, are ""metaphors on two legs."" That, I think, undercuts the compassion of the film.The characters may be metaphors, but they are also recognizable individuals, whether determinedly, hilariously steeped in Hindu mysticism, like the beautiful Madeleine (Myriam Mezire), who believes the mind can be fertilized by particular sex practices; or, like the lantern-jaw Mathieu, who is dedicated to shaping a better future for his new son, Jonah.Mr. Tanner's characters talk incessantly, sometimes, as in the case of Marco, they lecture, playing with theories of history, time, revolution, education and capitalism with such enthusiasm that the spirit of the talk has the effect of giving comic perspective to metaphors not of the first freshness (""the highway of capitalism is collapsing"").The stories of the individual characters, which connect casually, gracefully, are punctuated by fantasies that, in contrast to the rest of the color film, are photographed in black and white. They are short, mischievous, sometimes sad, occasionally erotic, always informed, as in the entire film, by Mr. Tanner's awareness that these people, whether two-legged metaphors or not, inhabit a specific society in a particular time.The performances are so thoroughly integrated with the material that I'm not sure where performances begin and the work of the director and the writers leaves off. The entire cast is splendid.""Jonah,"" which will be shown at the 14th New York Film Festival today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 9 P.M., will open here at the Fine Arts Theater within the next several weeks. It's a window on a European political-intellectual world seldom seen in filmsand never seen with such an appreciation of cinematic style.",1976-10-02T05:00:00+0000

In most cases, it is taken for granted that the search will follow the rules of evidence laid down by modern science.

This is true whether the film is a Western like John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn, a gangster melodrama like Mervyn Le Roy's Little Caesar, a screwball comedy like Frank Capra's It Happened One Night, or a W.C.

us,'Kings' Travel Long Screen Road,"Roads have usually been thought of as destinations; they were built to go somewhere and that's what people mostly have used them for. But destinations have been in decline these last few decades, at least as a subject for the imagination. ""On the Road,"" ""Easy Rider,"" these were about leaving, not about arriving.In ""Kings of the Road,"" by the West German director Wim Wenders, there is nothing but the road, or a series of roads. They run through the North German plain, overcast most of the time, with fog and rain erupting continually and with a sunlight that manages to look dark. The world, whether as a point of departure or a destination, has all but finishedthe road remains as a kind of Limbo of our time.""Kings,"" which is being shown today and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival and will open Tuesday at the Embassy 72d Street Theater, focuses upon two citizens of the road, one permanent and one temporary.The first is Bruno, who makes his home in a moving-van and drives from town to town fixing the projectors in the local movie house. He is loose, sleepy, shrewd, good-humored and totally unattached. He longs for women, is attractive to them, but lacks the power of concentrationpermanent or temporaryto settle on any particular one.Bruno has accepted aimlessness and unattachment. He drives through the dour countryside and visits the dour towns, whose streets are virtually unpopulated and whose gas stations seem to be always closed. It's not that aimlessness doesn't hurt him: It does, but so deeply that he doesn't show it.He has, in fact, only one commitment: to the proper projection of motion pictures and the proper maintenance of the machinery. It is a solitary ideal; the projectionists he deals with are slipshod and indifferent, and more and more villages are are shutting their cinemas down.Bruno has withdrawn from the world, then, or perhaps it is the other way around. Into his solitude, propelled at full speed, comes a temporary refugee, Robert. Robert is an intellectual who engages actively with societyhe studies children's speechbut his recent encounters have been shattering. His wife has left him, for example.Two meet, comically: Robert, full of anger and distraction, drives his car into a lake by mistake and it sinks. Bruno and his van are parked nearby. They join forces.It is a long, slow, wandering they embark upon. Robert becomes Bruno's assistant. He can't face his own world, for the time being: but every time he spots a telephone he tries to call his wife, and every time he sees a newspaper on the ground he reads it.There are a series of encounters in which each, in his own way, enacts the difficulty of communication. Bruno spends a night with the cashier of a movie house. There is a lovely tenderness, but all he can do, literally, is sleep with her.Robert visits his father, editor of a small newspaper, and tries to speak of his childhood resentments. But he can't get the words out so finally, as the old man sleeps at his desk, the son goes to work on the linotype. By morning, he has printed a two-page denunciation of his father's treatment of his mother. He finishes, hands the pages to his father; they embrace delicately and part.Eventually, Robert goes back. His nature is to commit himself, even to an imperfect, half-dead world. He takes a train, that most constrained and committed form of transportation. Bruno, the idealist, wanders on in his lumpy van, whose mournful pace and elephantine presence make a lovely unifying symbol for the film.It needs one badly. ""Kings"" is often fascinating. It has a number of compelling and witty scenes, and its imagery is harshly apt. But it is three hours long, which is at least an hour too much; and its successes are scattered like meager raisins through a mass of gray dough.It moves like silence and sleep, and with a great parsimony of things to look at. Nothing happens but what is happening, and it happens one thing at a time, and one or two people at a time. Our peripheral vision is starved, and we are ready to take the train some time before Robert does.",1976-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Alex and Gypsy,' Sutton Film With Lemmon, Misses Mark","Genevieve Bujold is standing in the garden, dressed in a red nightgown. She is looking fiercely at the moon and saying:""Jowl, jowl.""Why is she saying that?Because, in the new movie, ""Alex and the Gypsy,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton Theater, she plays a gypsy. And ""jowl, jowl,"" we are told, is what gypsies say when they want to get pregnant.It is a small point, but it is a fair sample of the kind of ludicrousness that repeatedly overtakes ""Alex,"" a movie that works away at being wonderful, funny and romantic. Once in a while it succeeds, but more often it is like the star English pupil in a Borneo grammar school reciting the witches' lines from ""Macbeth."" The sounds are there, more or less, but the emphases are wildly off.""Alex"" is about a bail bondsman, a man who puts up surety that people facing a trial will show up for it, and protects his risk by keeping a close watch on them. Alex, played by Jack Lemmon, is a crabby, cynical man whose pride in his peculiar work is masked by a flood of black humor.Alex's carefully controlled life was knocked askew just once. Maritza, running away from her arranged gypsy wedding, attached herself to him. Her unreserved and enthusiastic passion foundered on his cragginess, and she walked out. When the movie opens, Maritza is back, this time awaiting sentencing for stabbing her thuggish husband.She begs Alex to bail her out for the four days before sentencing; gypsies die in jail, she tells him. He hesitates, then puts up the bail. The balance of the movie is devoted to the four days they spend together. He is a watchdog gradually defanged by love: she, the defanger, turns the watchdog into something like a racing whippet.Except for an awkward use of flashbacks showing the earlier relationship of Alex and Maritza, the film is well constructed and well paced. There are some lovely details: for example, Alex's disenchanted grilling of a potential customer, a horrendous young maniac arrested for setting fire to someone who annoyed him. ""Arson,"" Alex decides. ""That's a bailable offense.""The central relationship, the dismantling of a sour principle of order by black-haired, black-eyed Life Force, is hardly a novelty, but it has possibilities and sometimes it is touching.But neither of the principals brings it off. Miss Bujold is a good actress if she has a compelling energy on the screen. But she is quite wrong in the part. It's not merely her catered accent; as if ""jowl, jowl"" and an erractic deletion of the definite article were enough to establish the gypsy. More seriously, her tumultuousness is only flamboyance. It lacks the stolidity, the reserve that is essential to any representation of gypsy passion. She comes close to resembling the American tourist shown dancing Flamenco in sherry ads, her arms raised a fatal 3 inches too high.Jack Lemmon, scruffy, tough and vulnerable, has a role that is modeled on a Sam Spade or a Philip Marlowe. The object is to be a Noble Wreck. But Mr. Lemmon lacks the assurance, the self-denial for wrecked nobility. He keeps letting the shlemiel in, and the tension out. There is an essential difference between irony and clowning, but Mr. Lemmon doesn't manage it.",1976-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Three Men and a Horse,"In the past it has been Muhammad Ali's practice to retire the morning after a fight. On one occasion, in Kuala Lumpur for a caper with Joe Bugner, he announced his retirement before the fight. The fact that it took him 48 hours after his match with Ken Norton to pack it in again shows how he is slowing down. The Norton bout made it clear that the champion has next to nothing left as a fighter of the top rank, though this seemed to escape the attention of the ring officials. Whether he makes his comeback this year or next, it says here that he cannot whip Norton or George Foreman, and there may be others among the leading contenders who would be too much for him. One of this group, Duane Bobick, presented his credentials on television Saturday afternoon. He opened a few more crevices in Chuck Wepner's hemstitched visage, stopping Bayonne's oneman blood bank in the sixth round. At the same time, however, the real heavyweight champion of the worlda horse named Foregowas doing his thing on another network and this caused such a distraction it was difficult to appraise Bobick's performance accurately.

us,"Italy's 'Illustrious Corpses,' Disappointing Film","More and more, Francesco Rosi, the Italian director of such politically conscious films as ""Salvatore Giuliano,"" ""Hands Upon the City"" and the recent ""The Mattei Affair,"" has come to construct his movies as if they were jig-saw puzzles from which key pieces must remain missing. This is not because he hasn't a very good idea what the missing pieces are, but because he thinks that to supply them would dampen the speculation he means to stir up.Sometimes, as in the case of ""The Mattei Affair,"" this works. But then ""The Mattei Affair"" was based on the life of an Italian industrialist who died under circumstances that have never been satisfactorily explained. In the newest Rosi film, ""Illustrious Corpses"" (""Cadaveri Eccellenti""), the method is self-defeating. It stirs up not speculation but suspicions that the completed picture is artificially made more complex and provocative than its missing pieces would have revealed it to be.Until one realizes that one has been manipulated to rather predictable ends, ""Illustrious Corpses"" is a dazzling example of fashionably radical Italian film makingelegantly composed, breathlessly paced, photographed in the beautiful, drained colors of a landscape in mourning for the sun. It's all so beautiful, in fact, that when you see a long shot of a Sicilian piazza in which everything, including the sky, is the same matching beige, you wouldn't be at all surprised to see a high-fashion model, dressed to the scarlet nines, posing amid beige urchins.The setting of ""Illustrious Corpses"" seems to be Sicily, though it's never identified, which allows the director to create a fictitious capitalistic social-political structure that cannot be immediately criticized for not being accurately Italian. Wherever it is, corruption and conspiracies are rampant, the poor are getting poorer, the rich are getting richer and the paranoid power elite, when it isn't listening to wiretaps and watching movies made by hidden cameras, attends parties where there are women and food to enchant every tastebud.The film begins effectively enough. A prominent prosecutor is murdered. Several days later, a prominent judge is similarly assassinated. Later another judge, and another. The country is thrown into disorder. Inspector Rogas (Lino Ventura), a creased, tired policeman from a more conventional mystery melodrama, investigates and becomes convinced that a man, who was once wrongly convicted and sent to prison, is carrying out a campaign of revenge.The inspector's superiors, however, don't want to hear his evidence. More assassinations occur. The inspector then stumbles on a conspiracy that involves all of his superiors, who are apparently using one man's private vengeance to effect a plot involving the fate of the nation.""Illustrious Corpses"" is full of individually arresting details, such as a sequence shot in an ancient catacomb and a scene in which Max Von Sydow, as the mad chief justice, explains that when a judge ""celebrates the law,"" he is like a priest celebrating mass and thus incapable of error. I particularly liked Alain Cuny as another rotten judge, a man completely, almost beatifically composed except for his wayward left hand. It keeps wanting to misbehave and has to be slapped in punishment.All of these arresting details and bizarre characters don't eventually add up to much more than an indictment of government that's so broad, so general, it has no particular force. The end effect is trivial. This is not to say that ""Illustrious Corpses"" is boring. Rather it's acutely disappointing.

us,Story of Sin' Delights the Eye but Fails to Be Gripping,"If sin, like truth and beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, then ""Story of Sin,"" the Polish entry at the New York Film Festival tonight and tomorrow night, is a delight to the eye. But Walerian Borowczyk, the Polish director who previously worked in France, is enamored of a saga that is, in essence, a cross between grand and soap opera.His principals may be true to themselves. Victorian moralities and their vintage settings but, despite the dedication of the director and his cast, their ""Story of Sin"" evolves more as a quaint, visually engrossing album of a faded past than as a gripping motion picture.In fashioning his script from an old Polish novel, Mr. Borowczyk, and an English prologue and subtitles, make it plain that turn-of-the-century Czarist-dominated Warsaw was rough on the staunchly Catholic, disenfranchised Polish petit bourgeois. And our pure, religiously proper young heroine is no exception. She is quickly caught up in the throes of first love with a lodger in her parents' apartment who, it happens, is seeking a divorce. As might be guessed, this is the start of a convoluted, bitter romance indicating that sin isn't necessarily simple.As was the case in Mr. Borowczyk's ""Immoral Tales,"" seen here early this year, eroticism, costuming, settings and photography are artistically detailed. Lovers engulfed in newly found ecstacy in cramped village quarters or in a baroque Riviera suite leave little to the imagination.And lust and murder are made equally specific in rich, red damask rooms filled with bibelots and the sounds of a raucous ancient gramophone.The primal drive of love and the beastliness of sinners in our heroine's life make for a complex plot with some seemingly abrupt transitions. But Mr. Borowczyk's fascination with his subject appears to have rubbed off on his willing players. If he is precise in dealing with action in the boudoir, he is just as careful in maintaining a fast narrative pace.(In a largely unbilled cast that contributes to that momentum, Grazyna Dlugolecka is outstanding as the pretty, driven outcast. She is curvaceous, but more importantly, genuinely winning and realistic, both as the virgin introduced to love and sex amid swirling white petticoats or nude or in black corsets as the seemingly callous streetwalker.If Jerzy Zelnik's portrait of her beleaguered student dover is merely a profile, others, including Olgierd Lucaszewicz, vigorously project sincere if sometimes-postured portrayals.Mr. Borowczyk and his actors colorfully evoke the people and places of a restrictive society with the dedication of historians. There inspection of the complexities of sin, however, is as obvious and colorful as a vintage snapshot.""Story of Sin"" is slated to start an engagement at the RKO Twin 1 Theater on East 59th Street next Thursday.",1976-10-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Minnellis, Pereet Fille","IF you can imagine a feature-film equivalent to a Radio City Music Hall stage show, it might look very much like Vincente Minnelli's ""A Matter of Time,"" which opened yesterdayappropriatelyat Radio City Music Hall, where Mr. Minnelli began his career years ago as a designer and producer. It is full of glittery costumes and spectacular props. It is performed by talented, sophisticated people who adopt the faux-naif gestures of an earlier show-biz tradition, and though it is expensive, it sounds peculiarly tacky.""A Matter of Time"" might better have retained the title of the Maurice Druon novel from which John Gay adapted his screenplay""Film of Memory."" ""A Matter of Time"" is a jumbosize pousse-caf of memories in the form of a fairy tale about a little girl from the Italian provinces who comes to Rome and becomes a big, glamorous movie queen.Its principal star is none other than Liza Minnelli, Mr. Minnelli's daughter by Judy Garland and a screen personality whose appearance recalls her father and whose voice and mannerisms recall her mother. She has talent of her own, but it comes to us through the remembered presence of others.""A Matter of Time"" is not only composed of memories, it is about memory as a mysteriously enriching human capacity, though it never realizes the poetic potential of its subject. Playing opposite Miss Minnelli is Ingrid Bergman as a dotty old contessa, once the toast of Europe and now reduced to living in poverty in the rundown, hotel where Liza takes a job as a chamber-maid.As the contessa spins tales about her turn-of-the-century conquests, little Liza, whose eyes seem to have been widened surgically to play this part, relives the memories on screen, providing Mr. Minnelli with an opportunity for some fancy, romantic fooling of the sort that distinguished the regression sequences in ""On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.""Only one sequence, however, comes off with the anticipated lan: Liza, as the contessa, is the hostess at one of those gala, pre-World War I Venice masquerades. She bids good night on the Grand Canal to the Kaiser (""Please call me Wilhelm""), walks back into her palazzo, knee-deep in confetti, discarding her costume as she goes. By the time she reaches the far end of the ballroom, she has returned to mid-20th, century. There, backed by five black musicians who had been packing to leave, she drifts into a sort of elegiacal rendition of the great Gershwin number, ""Do It Again.""No other moment in the film comes anywhere near to capturing this sort of ghostly, romantic elegance. In addition to ""Do It Again,"" Miss Minnelli sings two new Fred Ebb-John Kander songs, yet the film has the air of an operetta from which the music has been removed. It's even acted that way.When Miss Minnelli's chambermaid enters a room, it's the way chambermaids enter rooms in operettas. She opens the door breezily, twirls around to close the door with her back to the audience, thus making it possible for her to be struck with dumb surprise or shock when she turns again to see what's going on. It's all a teeny, tiny bit arch.So is the casting of Charles Boyer in the small role of the contessa's long-lost husband, recalling the teaming or Miss Bergman and Mr. Boyer in ""Gaslight."" Mr. Boyer has such weight that, after he has been on the screen, the film seems even flimsier than it need be when he disappears.A further family note: Isabella Rossellini, Miss Bergman's daughter by Roberto Rossellini, shows up at the end of the film as a nun, looking meltingly beautiful, much the way her mother did when she first came to Hollywood.The English dialogue of the European actors has apparently been post-synchronized, which contributes to the effect of overall hollowness of the movie. Because ""A Matter of Time"" has moments of real visual beauty, and because what the characters say to each other is mostly dumb, it may be a film to attend while wearing your earplugs.""A Matter of Time"" has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") for reasons that may have to do with the merest soupon of discreet nudity, but I'm not sure. It seems totally harmless to me.",1976-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A 'Shadow of the Hawk',"A threshold of fright so minimal that it is bestirred by a jack-in-the-box or a Halloween mask seems to be the pre-requisite for enjoyment of ""Shadow of the Hawk,"" now playing at an assortment of local theaters.To make a long and rather tedious story short, this seems to be the Indian version of ""The Exorcist,"" with chief Dan George as the old medicine man who journeys to the big city to bring back his grandson, played by Jan-Michael Vincent, to apply the strength of youth against a wily evil sorceress named Dsonoqua.At no time is there any question about the outcome of this 200-year-old family feud. But as grandfather and grandson proceed, accompanied by a freelance woman journalist, masks come out of the woods and mist, snakes and bears attack, Indians with white-painted faces appear and disappear, humans take on animal form and cars do strange things. There are incantations and machinations with tiny dolls.The director, George McCowan, tends to be better at conveying eeriness with cinematic devices, such as a car that appears and disappears and finally crashes into an invisible wall, than he is at conjuring up terror with the myriad Indian props at his disposal. Dsonaqua is too ill-defined to be taken seriously as a match for the old medicine man and the new. ""Shadow of the Hawk"" settles for minor intermittent surprises instead of cumulative horror. The PG rating may be attributable to the general intent of the film, rather than to any particular excesses of language, violence or sexual activity.",1976-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Good Guys vs. Bad Guys:'Fighting Mad' Is Showing at Neighborhood Theaters,"Given a determined effort at self-delusion, it is possible to believe that ""Fighting Mad,"" which opened Friday at neighborhood theaters, is just another good guys versus bad guys movie. The bad guys in this case are a strip miner-land developer, his henchmen, corrupt politicians and inertia-ridden policemen, and the good guys are the sort of farm folk that we know are determined to cleave to their land because they have the sort of faces that made nimble the brush hands of Grant Wood and Norman Rockwell.The truth is that ""Fighting Mad,"" starring Peter Fonda, is a little less than just another good guys versus bad guys movie. The holes in its story line occasionally yawn wide enough to admit six abreast the bulldozers that evil, murderous Crabtree is using in the strip-mining and land-development schemes that are consuming and menacing the farmers' land.One of the landowners is the father of Tom Hunter, played by Fonda. He has come home to the family horse ranch from the city with his little boy after the breakup of his marriage only to find the clean rustic life he seeks imperilled by men who will stop at nothing to impose their vision of progress on the farmers. So he takes up the cudgels or whatever else is handy.The result is a film so determined to stir the viscera that it overlooks the nourishment of the brain. The real lesson of this sort of movie doesn't seem to be that right wins out in the end. Not so bad comes through. Villains and peripheral characters suffer and die when injured and shot. The protagonist's gunshot wounds don't hurt too much and heal fast. And the law doesn't seem to mind vigilantes.Well, it isn't life. And, heaven knows, it isn't art.",1976-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Strongman Ferdinand,' at Film Festival, Is Original Satire of West German Society","The morning is sour and dark. Ferdinand Rieche, a security policeman demoted for overzealousness, is having breakfast. With a mournful countenance, a prominent nose and a face that resembles both mousetrap and mouse, he devours raisin cake. The radio announces a tropical storm approaching Wiesbaden.Ferdinand grabs his atlas, locates Wiesbaden, assesses its distance from the East German frontier, road routes, rivers. He chews and ponders: who can be behind this storm?This is part of the prologue of Alexander Kluge's ""Strongman Ferdinand,"" a satire on West German society that is being shown in the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall today and tomorrow. It is obsessively narrow in its focus and drawn out too far, but in its better momentsand there are a lot of themit is original, apt and very, very funny.Nothing is so troublesome to a society as a man who follows its principles literally. To Kluge, West Germany is a society that maintains a fat complacency by making an idol of order and resistance to change.Rieche is the dangerous total believer. He pursues order to the point where it becomes outlawry, mad yet oddly logical. Security is his profession and his obsession. When a superior at the factory where he has become chief of securityafter leaving the police forcequestions the usefulness of his elaborate measures, he retorts:""With security, it's not a question of usefulness."" It is a question of the whole purpose of life.""Strongman Ferdinand"" is the tragicomic story of what happens when Rieche50, in poor health, his career broken by his tendency to harangue his police superiors on the need to arrest people before they break the lawgets a last chance.The factory security post becomes vacant. The previous chief was discharged for placing snipers to shoot workers who break plant discipline. The press had got on to the story, and so the bossesbland, hypocritical men  hire Rieche. They order him to do ""enough, but not too much"" but they have hired a one-man disaster.Within 48 hours, Rieche has knocked down his office walls with a sledgehammer to make it bigger, turned it into an advanced communications post, begun drilling the middle-aged factory guards as an lite commando force, and put in so many locks that the washroom attendant is locked in.Obstacles are put in the way of this small figure with the enormous head who storms around in a green trenchcoat, upsetting everything. He has to take a medical exam: his solution is to force a young woman employee caught pilfering to give him her urine sample. ""Very young urine,"" the doctor congratulates him. ""In fact, if you were a woman, I'd say you were three months pregnant.""More seriously, the factory bosses keep cracking down on him for excess; as when he and his guards raid another factory for a training exercise, or when he insists on body-searching a group of visiting American industrialists. It become a mounting war between Rieche and management and eventually, as the battles become more and more comically outrageous, between Rieche and a society that can't understand his efforts to defend it.The movie is done in short, clipped sequences  there are too many of them, though  each like a brief stanza in the ballad of Rieche. The dry, deadpan style of this social fantasy is counter-pointed beautifully by a camera that becomes lyrical: focusing on a full moon wrinkled by chimney smoke, or showing the security guards drilling on the beach at dawn and lit up in profile like a line of long-legged wading-birds.The harshness is redeemed even more by the character of Ferdinand himself, memorably played by Heinz Schubert. He is a small man who sometimes totters under the weight of his big mission. He is fond of cake and his blonde taxi-driving girlfriend, Gertie. They celebrate birthdays at midnight feast in cheap restaurants, and go on a winter trailer trip to practice for Christmas.""Christmas needs training or it won't work,"" Rieche says. He is something like Chaplin; something like Hitler played by Chaplin. The combination is unforgettable.",1976-10-09T05:00:00+0000

But the frenzied, largely incredible kung fu action fare he popularized is still being churned out in familiar style by the Orient's busy moviemakers. However, ""Touch of Zen,"" the Taiwanese feature on view this afternoon and tomorrow night at the New York Film Festival, is proof that familiarity can also breed a touch of annoyance with a standard approach to the genre.Its unfamiliar writer-director, King Hu, has not ignored traditional mayhem here, but he has demonstrated that pictorial artistry, Zen mysticism and the stylized martial arts, can make a fascinating mix.There is more than a touch of Zen and mystery in this period piece, despite its English subtitles. Program notes are necessary in fixing the time and locale as 14th-century China. But it is slowly made evident that a murderous warlord is out to eliminate a fugitive young lady loyal to the Ming Emperor, whose father he has aready dispatched; her two trusted aides and her country-bumpkin lover.Our renegade brunette beauty, it should be stressed, is no demure flower arranger. She is, it turns out, a prize pupil and acolyte of Zen Buddhist monks, who are as adept at weaponless, defensive kung fu as they are devoted to pacifism. As befits a grand myth, she and her equally expert cohort eventually eliminate those blood-thirsty pursuers in a succession of clanging swordplays and hand-to-hand clashes.As a Renaissance man also credited with the film's art direction and costumes, King Hu, who reportedly spent several years on this king-sized (three-hour) project, is obviously as dedicated to visual beauty and meditative Zen concepts as he is to action. And his views of gloomy bamboo forests, sun-dappled, green or rocky mountain crevasses and rushing rivers and waterfalls make truly spectacular backgrounds to both the peaceful and warring moods of the monks and the combatants.The confrontations between our heroine and her monks and the glaring villains are, of course, ludicrous and impossible. But King Hu and his cinematographer, Hua Hui-Ying, have staged all the prodigious leaps, the sparring and sword swinging with eye-catching, balletic effect.Aside from the almost mandatory posturing called for in these bouts, the performances are naturalistic, if flamboyant on occasion. As the saffron-robed monk-abbot, Roy Chiao Hung is a monolithic figure who not only is impressive as an imperturbable, unbeatable karate-chopper but also is fairly convincing as a contemplative type. Hsu Feng is animated and appealing as the harried lady sword swinger who sadly forsakes her lover and baby and chooses peace and sanctuary in his monastery. Shih Chun is properly trusting and helpful as her lover and Tien Peng makes a handsome, if menacing, secret-police official.In adapting his material from a collection of classical Chinese short stories, King Hu and his cooperative crew have given us a mite too much of a good thing. But they have added a touch of class to this ""Touch of Zen.""",1976-10-10T05:00:00+0000

Being a wellknown author (The American Way of Death) Jessica Mitford receives a lot of requests from publishers for a quote they can use in advertising a book (assuming it's a favorable quote, of course). Generally she turns them down, she wrote us, but recently, to help out a young woman writer whose book she found a jolly good effort, Miss Milford sent a quote indicating she thought the book totally absorbing. She was crestfallen when the embarrassed author wrote back: It seems that the publisher's experience with the words totally absorbing has been that they are not as effective as certain other descriptive words, Better Miss Mitford should say something along the lines of tremendously exciting and important or highly significant and compelling drama. Miss Mitford brooded a while and then came up with a modest proposal: How about asking the publishers to furnish a checklist . . . of desirable phrases for use on book jackets? The checklist could be graduated, starting with such triedandtrue encomia as blockbuster and ending with my poor old ineffective totally absorbing. I believe this would save everybody a lot of time, particularly if the list were coded; one would merely have to notify the publisher of the code number (e.g., 1 for blockbuster, 18 for totally absorbing).

The 19th century gave us Tolstoy's moving explorations of the deathstruck consciousness of Anna Karenina and Ivan Ilych and of a race horse who had more in common with lovely Anna than with pitiful Ivan. Lawrence followed Tolstoy in his portrayal of Gerald Crich's snow death at the end of Women in Love.

Sissman in Dying: an Introductionhave tried to examine this onetoacustomer experience only one of whose dimensions is believed by the religious to be physical. Who can measure their success?

Feminists have glossed anthropology to exalt a prepatriarchal Eden in which we had full control of our bodies and our destiny. Whatever struggle one is waging, Utopianism comes before analysis, the Fouriers precede the Marxes. Although a major task of both movements has been to demythologize attributes of character (blacks are lazy, women are irrational), idealization of the past seems to be an early stage of any struggle for decolonization.

We don't follow these demigods or gorgons for their own sakes but because they give us a far view of a near condition.The mortal defect of Jacques Rivette's ""Duelle"" is not its slow pace or mannered style or even its obscurities. It is its failuredeliberate, apparentlyto cross over to its audience at any point or to inveigle its audience across to it.""Duelle,"" which is showing today and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall, is about the struggle between a Sun spirit and a Moon spirit, in the course of which several ordinary people are badly chewed up. It is simply about itself, despite its contemporary references and setting. It spills over into nothing of ours but dcor, and even the dcor is an airless, garish, 1930's affair.The whole thing is filmed inside a Tiffany lamp. As the characters stand at the far end of significant perspectives, they resemble nothing so much as show-window mannequins draped portentiously in the foreground of some nonexistent intriguesheikhs seducers or beached Rolls-Royces in the background.Bulle Ogier and Juliet Berto are, respectively, the Sun and Moon spirits. They duel for possession of a large diamond that will permit the victor to remain on earth for more than the allotted 40 days annual terrestrial leave. Both are fine actresses and it is interesting to see what different effects their inchoate roles have upon them.Miss Berto has mobile features and the wooliness of her part results in our not being quite sure, for a long way into the film, whether she is one or several characters. Miss Ogier, an actress of very pronounced character, is always Bulle Ogier; sometimes dressed up in a Sun-spirit wig.Their rivalry has them interfering in the lives of several people  Lucie, a hotel night clerk; Elsa, a tax dancer, and Pierrot, a man of no defined profession who variously possess or know the whereabouts of the talisman. The rival spirits maneuver these humans back and forth. All three end up damager, two of them mortally.The episodes, and some of the speeches, drift off at times into substantial obscurity; although their general meaning is not hard to grasp. Rivette and his screenwriter, Eduardo de Gregorio, have set out the two spirits with a deliberate, prosaic harshness. There is nothing suggestive or allusive about them.Their virtue, at most and only rarely, is to be funny. There is an amusing scene where they gossip through pastry and champagne in what looks like a corner of the Hotel Ritz, before taking up their duel.There are one or two places where Rivette takes the momentum of the duel's climax and makes something visually affecting out of it: a confrontation, for instance, on a Metro platform between the Moon spirit and Pierrot.

It's like making something called ""King Kong 2"" with only a view or two of an ape in long shot.The original ""Sounder"" was a sentimental, immensely popular film about the maturing of a small black farm boy under various types of adversity. The sequel has more maturing, more adversity and enough unleavened sentimentality to give a rhinoceros heart-burn.""Part 2 Sounder"" is about the same Louisiana farm family as the original. David, the boy, sets his heart on getting a school for the neighborhood. His father, Nathan, takes up the cause, enlists his neighbors, and works day and night to get a schoolhouse built so that the local teacherwho planned to go Northwill stay.It is a depressed kind of film, with a lot of gloominess and teeth-gritting. It is unrelievedly didacticabout the need of working hard and persevering and believingand lets in as little life or liveliness as a McGuffey's Reader. As the mother, dubious about the school-building effort. Ebony Wright gives a performance that is strong and modulated and above its material. As the father, Harold Sylvester does an obvious rendition of gloom and resolution. The children, particularly Darryl Young as David, are allowed to overact painfully.""Part 2 Sounder,"" which opened yesterday at showcase theaters, has Robert B. Radnitz as executive producer and Lonne Elder 3d as screenplay-writer. They were the authors of the original ""Sounder""; on the other hand, Mr. Radnitz has chosen a new director, William Graham, to replace Martin Ritt, as well as a new cast.

us,Film Festival: 'Harlan County',"COAL MINERS are a permanent underground in more than the literal sense. They trouble any society they support: like feet, the more they are weighed down by their owners the more pain they give.In East Germany and Poland the authorities treat them with a special deference. Even in its harsher times the Franco regime was never able to stop them from striking. Laws against assembly were useless. A hammer would stop a mile below ground; the man in the next chamber would go to see what the matter was; the silence would spread and a line of stubborn, blackened men came to the surface and stayed until the Government could figure out some way of getting them back down.Miners' strength, their assertiveness and solidarity are based largely on their economic power; and where coal-mining becomes marginal to the economy of a region, they lose much of their ability to fight. There is another factor, though. Miners in their tunnels, vulnerable to explosions, cave-ins and destroyed lungs, weigh on a society's conscience as well as its economy. Their grievances command an instinctive respect.One of the reasons for the defeat of Prime Minister Edward Heath in Britain two years ago was a widespread feeling that in choosing the miners as the target for his austerity fight he had picked just the wrong target.""Harlan County, U.S.A.,"" to be shown tonight and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall, is a full-length documentary of the year-long strike carried on by the miners at the Brookside works in eastern Kentucky. It has flaws, some of them considerable, but it is a fascinating and moving work. Its strength lies chiefly in its ability to illuminate the peculiar frightfulness and valor of coal-mining, and made it clear just why coal-miners can never be rightly treated as a less than a very special case.Barbara Kopple and her photographers have got right inside the life of the miners and their families in their long struggle against the operators of the Brookside mine and its parent company, the Duke Power Company. It is a brilliantly detailed report from one side of a battle that caused one death, several shootings and a flood of violent bitterness; and that brought back to Harlan County memories of the much-bloodier coal strikes of the early 1930's.The strike began after the miners voted to join the United Mine Workers of Americawhich had lost its hold in eastern Kentuckyand the owners refused to sign a standard U.M.W. contract. It was not until more than a yaer laterafter the violence had claimed the life of one striker  that Duke Power, under strong pressure from Federal mediators, agreed to sign.The film shows the picketing, the use of state troopers to keep the road open for nonstrikers, the confrontations, a shooting, the efforts of the strikers and their families to remain organized and united through the long year. It intercuts old footage from the 1931 strike, where five miners were killed. It also details the successful battle of reformers to oust the old national leadership of the U.M.W.; and the support given to the Harlen County strike by the new leadership under Arnold R. Miller.Some of the thematic interweaving is awkward, but this is more than made up for by the extraordinary intimacy Miss Kopple has achieved with the strikers and with the bitter life of the strike. There is an old miner, lungs torn by coal dust, who makes our chests hurt as he talks. There are frightening scenes of tight-lipped strike-breakers, guns openly displayed rushing through the pickets. There is a terrifying night scene where shots are fired and we see the leader of the strike-breakers brandishing a pistol in the cab of his pick-up truck. There is a heartbreaking scene where the mother of the slain miner collapses at his wake. There is much more, equally good.The film is entirely partisan. Considering that the company's refusal to sign a contract was condemned by the National Labor Relations Board as a pretext not to recognize the union and considering that the film itself is forthrightly an effort to see the struggle through the miners' own eyes, this is no real drawback. Perhaps there is some skimping: it is something of a cinematic trick to film the President of Duke Power in such tight closeup that his face completely fills the screen.More serious are the sometimes questionable ways in which the film advances its message: that the Harlan strike is only part of a struggle, and that the miners must go on struggling and striking. The instance I am thinking of comes in its suggestion that the reformist leadership of the U.M.W. may ave sold out in 1974after the Harlan County strike was overby recommending acceptance of a national mine contract that curtails local strikes.The film does not call this a sell-outit uses no narration at all and conveys its message by its editingbut all reactions of individual miners that it shows before the vote are negative. Yet the membership ratified the contract by 44,000 to 34,000. The film states this, to be sure; yet somehow all the faces we have learned to admire during the long Harlan County struggle seem to push us to feel toward Mr. Miller the same way we felt toward the recalcitrant mine owners.",1976-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Fassbinder's 'Fear of Fear',"THE most terrifying fear is the fear that has no discernable cause. It simply exists. Like an air plant, it requires no soil to flourish and grow, only a host.Margot (Margit Carstensen), the heroine in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's spare, spooky, always sunlit new film, ""Fear of Fear"" (Angstvor der Angst), knows that the anxieties she began to feel in the last months of her pregnancy, and that have become more and more frequent since the birth of her child, have no particular source.Margot is beautiful, with the perfect features of a department-store mannequin. She has a husband and two small children she loves. They have a car, a comfortable apartment, an idealized middle-class existence. Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law are continually prying into Margot's life and disapproving, but they can be dealt with. Yet something is decidedly wrong.There are times Margot feels as if she were existing under water. Communication is dulled. Movements are slow. To hear music she must turn up the stereo so high it shakes her brain cells. When she looks at that perfect face in the mirror she isn't sure she knows whose it is though she realizes that's crazy. Crazy? She takes a couple of Valiums or a swig of brandy and she calms down. For a little while, anyway.""Fear of Fear,"" which Mr. Fassbinder made last year for West German television, is about the autumn of materialism in the form of an intensely personal case history of a schizophrenic. As in the world where she lives, everything is perfect for Margot, yet nothing works. Something important is missing. Just what is never stated. The direction of the film is straightforward, blunt, but its meanings and associations are manifest obliquely.Mr. Fassbinder (""The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,"" ""The Merchant of Four Seasons,"" ""AliFear Eats the Soul"" and ""Fox"") continues to beat the age of 31the most fascinating, talented, prolific, original young film maker in West Germany and, for that matter, one of the most exciting in Western Europe today.Compared to a full-scale portraitist like Bernardo Bertolucci, he is a sketch artist, but the sketches are singular, and in their abundance they reveal a film maker of broad and original visions. His work is so rich that I'm sure not even he is always aware of the interpretations that can be read into them, nor that he much cares. He's already moved on to a new project.""Fear of Fear"" is a small film, as perfectly sculpted as Miss Carstensen's features, which, in turn, were as much a part of the decor as the settings and costumes of ""Petra Von Kant."" The film looks realistic, but these looks are deceiving. Like all Fassbinder films, ""Fear of Fear"" presents us with a distillation of realitya dream in which everything countsrather than photographed reportage on the way things are. Mr. Fassbinder is a major artist and one of the principal discoveries of the 14-year-old New York Film Festival.""Fear of Fear"" will be shown today at the festival at Alice Tully Hall at 6:15 P.M. and tomorrow at 9 P.M.",1976-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,'Car Wash' Froths on Screen With Pop Life,"It is early morning in the Los Angeles civilization of thruways, service stations, used-car lots, quick-lunch spots and portable swimming pools sold at discount. The start of another day much like any other, the dawn coming up with the voice of a manic disk jockey whose spiel is so fast that the last syllable of one word becomes the first syllable of the next. The sentences are nonstop and, like the records the disk jockey plays, they don't have endings. No record is ever allowed to finish. It is dismissed. The volume is lowered until it is overwhelmed by the record following. It's a glorious, unending river of sound, a Far Western metaphor for life measured in decibels.Thus begins ""Car Wash,"" a cheerful, somewhat vulgar, very cleverly executed comedy about what goes on in a single 10-hour period in a Los Angeles car wash. Written by Joel Schumacher, who wrote ""Sparkle,"" and directed by Michael Schultz, who was responsible for ""Cooley High,"" ""Car Wash"" dips into and out of the lives of more than two dozen characters. It demobilizes the old service comedy and returns it to civilian life in blithely free form.Lonnie (Ivan Dixon), the ex-con; Duane (Bill Duke), the black activist; Lindy, (Antonio Fargas), the homosexual whose wrist is limp and whose mouth is loud, and all the other workers at the car wash are updated G.I.'s out of uniform. Mr. B., (Sully Boyar), the harried owner of the car wash, would once have been the C.O. and his nitwit son, played by Richard Brestoff, who carries Mao's little red book around, wears a Mao T-shirt and wants to liberate the workers, is the commandant's overeducated offspring who is, of course, no match for the enlisted men.But ""Car Wash,"" which opened at four theaters in New York yesterday, is more than an old comedy genre recycled. It's a terrifically shrewd piece of movie-making.Mr. Schumacher, Mr. Schultz and the members of the large, mostly black cast have created a cohesive comedy out of dozens of tiny pieces of narratives and one outstanding ""cameo."" This is the appearance of Richard Pryor as ""Daddy"" Rich, the founder-head of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, a fellow who drives a gold limousine with a license plate that spells T-I-T-H-E.Some of the others who turn up in the course of the day are Lauren Jones as a down-on-her-luck hooker with a sullen disposition and a different wig for every occasion, and Melanie Mayron, who plays the car-wash secretary, a moony young woman who spends more time on her nail polish than on the accounts and who at one pointthough how I don't remembermanages to drop one contact lens into a jar of cold cream.There are also a mad bomber, played by Prof. Irwin Corey, as well as a ratty little boy who terrorizes the neighborhood by being so good on a skate board, a woman who's fearful that her son's having been sick on her car door will ruin its finish, a would-be holdup man and on and on.Nothing terribly dramatic happens, and some of the comedy gets a bit forced, but the wonder of the film is how it manages to succeed so much of the time. ""Car Wash"" has the rhythm, beat and drive of the rock songs that are playing throughout the film, virtually nonstop, all reflecting a certain mindless contemporary mood without saying anything whatsoever about it. If ""Car Wash"" makes no comment on our pop culture, it's because it's a piece of it.The film, which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly obscene words and rude gestures.",1976-10-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Deadly Hero,' a Manhattan Melodrama","""These are troubled times."" Don Murray, the troubled, titular cop of ""Deadly Hero,"" intones while rehearsing a speech to be made before a right-wing group. It's an augury of the rough out simplistic things to come in this fairly derivative Manhattan melodrama that crashed into local theaters yesterday.As a youthful 18-year veteran with bravery commendations, our hero has been demoted from detective to patrol cars as a dangerously quick-on-the-trigger, law-and-order type. So it's not surprising that, seething with anger and four-letter epithets??? he'll shoot a black mugger-shakedown artist who's been terrorizing a young woman at knifepoint in her West Side apartment.Hero? Not quite. On second, sober thought, the lady, a schoolteacher and conductor of an avant-garde musical, changes her testimony to implicate our tough cop as a cold-blooded killer. And, of course, threats, tragedy and terror follow in his frenzied steps to extricate himself from the mess.Mr. Murray's characterization of a blatant bigot forced into bloody desperation to save himself and his career may be workmanlike, but it is mostly superficial talk and action. Diahn Williams is attractive, but not especially forceful as the constantly threatened woman. And several topflight performers, including Lilia Skala, as her solicitous neighbor; James Earl Jones, as the malicious mugger, and George S. Irving, as an oily mayoral candidate, seem wasted in brief, broad portrayals.Graffiti-besmirched streets, a schoolroom, a rehearsal hall and a precinct station house bear the lively, moodfilled authenticity of a color film shot in New York. But the script and unimaginative direction by Ivan Nagy, a comparative newcomer to the movies, do little to enhance this thin, commonplace ""Deadly Hero.""",1976-10-16T05:00:00+0000

(Die Marquise von O. . . .), Eric Rohmer's German-language screen version of Heinrich von Kleist's 19th-century short story, should be to the new film season what Ingmar Bergman's ""The Magic Flute"" was to the last. It's a dazzling testament to the civilizing effects of several different arts, witty, joyous and so beautiful to look at that it must seem initially suspect to those of us who have begun to respond to spray-painted subway graffiti as the fine art of our time.The film was shown twice last night at Alice Tully Hall to end this year's New York Film Festival. It will open its commercial engagement Sunday at the 68th Street Playhouse.Kleist died early, a suicide at the age of 34, in 1811, leaving a small body of work that is little known in this country, aside from ""Michael Kolhass."" His play, ""The Prince of Homburg,"" will have its American premiere tomorrow night at Brooklyn's Chelsea Theater Center.""The Marquise of O. . . ."" which was awarded the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year, was mostly patronized by critics there as being, in the words of one reporter, ""simply likable."" This, I suppose, is probably the way someone might have described ""Cosi fan tutte"" had it had the odd fortune to have its premiere at a music festival along with 199 other operas.The association to ""Cosi"" is not accidental, although ""The Marquise of O. . . ."" hasn't a bar of music in it. It's a comedy of manners (early 19th century), precisely observed, romantic in mood and put into perspective by the disciplined intelligence of Mr. Rohmer, who follows the Kleist German text as if it were a screenplay.As he was in the films constituting his ""Six Moral Tales""including ""My Night at Maud's,"" ""Claire's Knee"" and ""Chloe in the Afternoon""Mr. Rohmer continues to be fascinated by characters ensnared by moral principles that, as often as not, are at complete variance to their passions. The crucial issue is the reconciliation of passion with principle, the space between the two being the arena where the comedy is played.I've not read the Kleist story, but if Mr. Rohmer has followed it as faithfully as he reports, it would seem that one of the reasons ""The Marquise of O. . . ."" is so successful is that the French director shares with Kleist an appreciation for a most benign sort of irony.The time is the late 18th century and the setting a small garrison town in northern Italy where the Marquise of O (Edith Clever), a beautiful, virtuous young widow lives with her two small children in the fortress where her father is the commandant. The night the Russians take the town, the highly principled marquise is saved from a brutal rape by a handsome, courtly Russian officer, the count (Bruno Ganz), who, as it turns out, is just as highly principled as the marquise. Almost, that is.A month or so later, the marquise suspects she may be pregnant, but the idea is so absurd she and her mother laugh at the idea. A few more days pass. The marquise becomes worried. She swears to her mother that she has a clear conscience, but also asks her mother to bring a midwife to examine her. Sniffs her mother, ""A clear conscience and a midwife?""What is apparent to the audience from the start is that the count, who had so honorably saved the marquise from rape by fellows of lesser rank and station, had himself, that same evening, taken advantage of her after she'd been put to sleep with some poppy-seed tea.Without acknowledging his slip from grace, the count almost immediately has sought to marry the marquise, but the marquise had vowed on the death of her husband never to remarry. She dismisses him. The count suffers. The marquise suffers.The pregnancy continues. The marquise's father and mother, scandalized, banish their wayward daughter to her country estate, where she plans to live in seclusion. After a while, though, she publishes a public notice to the effect that ""the Marquise of O. . . ., having become pregnant without her knowing how,"" will marry the father ""for family reasons, if he will present himself.""Though ""The Marquise of O. . . ."" has the shape of a fairy tale, Mr. Rohmer treats his characters with compassion for the predicaments that, to them, are profoundly seriousand to us profoundly absurd. He never mocks attitudes and choices. He illuminates them by accepting that vanished society on its own terms, and by evoking it in a production of breathtaking images that recall how the world looked to Jacques Louis David, whose ""Madame Recamier"" seems to have been the principal inspiration for Nestor Almendros, Mr. Rohmer's cameraman.The German actorsnone of whom I've seen beforeperform with the kind of grace I associate with stylish Restoration comedy, though the comedy here is of an entirely different sensibility. It's not brittle or bitchy. Characters don't talk from the head but from the heart, and one of the things that makes ""The Marquise of O. . . ."" much more than simply likable is our awareness that their feelings are earnestlypossibly fatallysincere.",1976-10-18T05:00:00+0000

If you don't, there's no point going.If you do, it's still a dubious proposition. Certainly the sound system at the Cinema I Theater, where it opened yesterday, does full justice to the decibels. Even using the squashed-up balls of paper napkin recommended by a knowledgeable member of this newspaper's music staff, it was loud. Powered ear-drum floated about.Presumably, though, putting this British rock group in a movie was intended to be the equivalent not of listening to their records but of attending one of their concerts. This is very hard to do on film: We miss the immediacy, the sense of physical presence and even, to an extent, physical peril. The power of a mass audience to communicate excitement is absent.To make up for this, the film intercuts a variety of scenes while each of the 13 numbers is being performed. A few are more or less realistic  a sequence outside Madison Square Garden, an argument between the group's manager and a Garden official  and others are fantasy. Members of the group put on cloaks, ride around on horses, stand in the moonlight.They are pseudodreams, like the unconvinced artwork on rock record jackets. The scenes showing the group performing are more informative though not much more powerful.They are dominated by the singer, Robert Plant. A great mass of yellow curls tumbling around his shoulders, Mr. Plant sashays around the stage, posturing, pouting and conducting a meaningful relationship with the microphone. It looks like a sheep trying to seduce a telephone pole.Possibly this is what led to a PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) rating.

Churchill has been presented by his critics, and even by some of his selfstyled friends, as man responsible for major strategic blunders, inconsiderate and tyrannical to his subordinates, petulant and childish, who betrayed the Poles and was unfair to General de Gaulle, a reactionary rhetorician inebriated, as Disraeli once said of Gladstone, with the exuberance of his own verbosity.

The theory that Maclean attributes to Koestler is hardly new (Koestler himself mentions earlier sources) and by no means accepted among scholars. Also, as Maclean and Koestler fail to mention, it has appeared in lunatic fringe antiSemitic propaganda for decades. Writing in the North American Review in March 1926, for example, Hiram Wesley Evans, imperial wizard of the then substantial Ku Klux Klan denigrated the Eastern Jews of recent immigration, the Jews known as the Askenasim [sic]. it is interesting to note that anthropologists now tell us that these are not true Jews, but only Judaized MongolsChazars.

us,'Seven-Per-Cent Solution' Movie An Exhilarating Collector's Item,"After two months in virtual seclusion. Sherlock Holmes summons his old friend and biographer, Dr. Watson, to his rooms in Baker Street. Dr. Watson, settled family man that he has become, is shocked by both the manner and the appearance of Holmes. He has always been thin but he is now rail-like. Worse, though, is Holmes's behavior. Either he has become a lunatic or he has stumbled onto the grandest criminal conspiracy of his career.His door bolted against the evil lurking outside. Holmes strides about his untidy, gas-lit study talking in disjointed fashion about a certain Professor Moriarty, a genius, a philosopher, an 'abstract thinker, a fiend of fiends whose existence Holmes has been in the process of deducing for the last two months. The name of Moriarty means nothing to Watson.""There's the genius and the wonder of the thing,"" exclaims Holmes, his eyes lighting up like the windows in an empty house one suddenly discovers to be haunted. ""The man pervades London, the Western world, even,"" he says, ""and no one has ever heard of him!"" At which point Watson notices the empty syringe on Holmes's desk. His friend has passed into the uncharted outer reaches of cocaine madness. Watson must act at once.The adventure is called ""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,"" which, as adapted by Nicholas Meyer from his best-selling novel and directed and produced by Herbert Ross, is nothing less than the most exhilarating entertainment of the film year to date. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Ross have taken a few small liberties with the book (which are all to the good) but the essential conceit remains.That is that Watson, in a desperate effort to save Holmes's life, must somehow get Holmes to Vienna for treatment by a new young doctor named Sigmund Freud, and that Holmes and Freud, two of the greatest minds of their time, join forces to solve a diabolical plot involving a beautiful, red-haired musical comedy star, an arrogant, dishonorable German baron, an amorous Turkish pasha and a great train chase through Austria to the very borders of the Ottoman Empire.The film, which opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater, is popular movie-making at its most stylish. It's simultaneously contemporary in its sensibility and faithful to the courtly mood and decent spirit of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle originals. It's also one of the most handsome evocations of a vanished period (circa 1890) since ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" and a collector's item in terms of performances.Nicol Williamson creates an entirely new Sherlock Holmes within our memories of all the old ones a man of incomparable mental brilliance who walks the world pursued by the hallucinations of his addiction. Alan Arkin is the good Dr. Freud at the beginning of his career, somewhat shy of manner immensely kind, and a little self-conscious about discussing the latest theories that have been getting him into hot water all over Vienna.Laurence Olivier is marvelous as Professor Moriarty, an extremely tentative, timid old fellow to be such a tycoon of crime, and Vanessa Redgrave is the unfortunate lady whose beauty drives mad those men who are rich and powerful.The particular revelation of ""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"" is Robert Duvall, one of America's best actors, who plays the English Dr. Watson with such wit and control that it's difficult to believe he's ever played an American with equal conviction. It's a very funny performance, and very important to the overall shape and cohesion of the film.Not since John Huston's ""The Man Who Would Be King"" and Sidney Lumet's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has there been a new film that manages so successfully to recall the innocent qualities one associates with pre-World War II movies without being simple-minded or instant camp. The initial credit must go to Mr. Meyer, whose novel is a fine piece of literary fooling, but Mr. Ross has been equally clever and disciplined in ealizing its screen potential. It's by far the best work he's done to date.""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"" has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), which is a way of alerting parents of small children to a fuzzily photographed primal-scene conclusion, some slightly nightmarish scenes involving Holmes's cocaine cure, and a sequence in a Viennese bordello that, when I was 5 years old. I would have instantly recognized as a lively, eccentric hotel.",1976-10-25T05:00:00+0000

When budding and branching starts, prune plants back bard, almost to the crown since Lantana flowers only on new growth. Repot when budding starts again.
