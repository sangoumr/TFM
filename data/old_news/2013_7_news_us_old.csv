(STARZ) A DANGEROUS METHOD (2011) A disturbed young Russian, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), is brought to a clinic in Zurich in the early 20th century, and a doctor named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, above with Ms. Knightley) performs a new treatment called psychoanalysis to help her. Soon she becomes his lover and finally a colleague. But as emotionally connected as Sabina is to Jung, it is with his mentor, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), that she finds a more cerebral affinity. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called this film from David Cronenberg, based on a play by its screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, and drawn from a book by John Kerr, a subtle and intellectually thrilling true story. The movie is full of ideas about sexuality  some quite provocative, even a century after their first articulation  but it also recognizes and communicates the erotic power of ideas, he said. There are scenes of kinky activity between Sabina and Jung that will no doubt enjoy long life in specialized corners of the Internet, but the most unsettling aspect of A Dangerous Method may be the links it suggests between sex and thinking. The mind is both slave and master of the bodys appetites, and the absurd and terrifying task of stabilizing that dynamic, in theory and in practice, is embraced equally by the film and the fragile, serious historical figures who inhabit it.

After the witness answered questions about his background, the judge closed the court for classified testimony. The trial will resume Tuesday.

The two older sons agree to their fathers terms and swear loyalty to him and to each other. But when the youngest argues that by dividing the lands, Hidetora is creating conditions that will lead to disaster, his father sends him into exile. At the same time, the wife (Mieko Harada, above) of his oldest son  the daughter of a lord conquered by Hidetora  encourages her husband to humiliate his father so he can assume control of the family in his own name. Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, Ran has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.",2013-07-02T05:00:07+0000

The irony is that the old Council accused Adam Paul of violating the City Charter and they used that as the basis to remove him from the office of mayor, said Chet Pleban, Mr. Pauls lawyer. Ironically, he was restored to the office of mayor because the Council violated the City Charter. Mr. Paul was a political novice who came to power on the back of a campaign against providing tax incentives for a developer to build a Walmart in Ellisville. Mr. Paul claimed that the Council had it in for him because of his opposition to the Walmart, while council members accused him of being brash, disrespectful and violating rules.

A safer polypropylene version was released in 2000, but it lacked the threaded, almost wood-like, appearance that appealed to the original buyers. Last month, at the NeoCon furniture fair in Chicago, the chair was reintroduced in fiberglass, but now the material emits no harmful gases or particles and is fully recyclable, representatives of Herman Miller said. The new version is offered in its nine original colors, in armchair and side chair versions, with a variety of bases. It will be available in September and will cost from $399 to $628.

Oeuf, the couples furniture company for children, is now 10 years old and has just introduced Elephant, a crib created with Carlos Tscar, a Spanish designer. Elephant takes 10 minutes to assemble and requires only a screwdriver. Like all Oeuf cribs, it can be transformed into a toddler bed (a conversion kit, sold separately, will be available in a few months). The material is medium-density fiberboard with a water-based nontoxic finish. Available in white or gray, it measures 57 by 33.75 by 34.75 inches and costs $675.

Three years later, the pair has developed a collection of 16 table lamps and 10 pendants, all one of a kind. Ms. Palmer made the bases, some inspired by Korean ceramics, others by Alberto Giacomettis lamps for Jean-Michel Frank, and Mr. Jacobs decided on appropriate shades. He explored different materials, including elastic banding and rope, and even hand-painted stylized dahlias on one, inspired by Ms. Palmers garden. He gave me free rein, and I did the same, Ms. Palmer said. Pendant lamps start at $1,200; table lamps range from $1,800 to $3,800. Information: (212) 627-0876.",2013-07-03T22:18:11+0000

(TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, kicks off with four films starring Jean-Pierre Laud, Truffauts on-screen alter ego. This first installment begins with The 400 Blows (1959), above, Truffauts feature film debut, in which he drew inspiration from his childhood for a story about Antoine Doinel, a 12-year-old who escapes his dysfunctional family by turning to crime. Words cannot state simply how fine is Jean-Pierre Laud in the role of the boy, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times. Out of this brand-new youngster, M. Truffaut has elicited a performance that will live as a delightful, provoking and heartbreaking monument to a boy. The homage continues at 9:45 with Antoine and Colette, Truffauts episode from Love at Twenty (1962)  an omnibus project featuring five segments directed by five filmmakers from five countries  and a short sequel to The 400 Blows, set three years later, in which Antoine has his first sentimental adventure. In Stolen Kisses (1968), at 10:30, Antoine, fresh out of the army, looks for work and ponders an affair with an older woman. In Bed and Board (1970), at 12:15 a.m., Antoine faces up to the responsibilities of adulthood. And in Love on the Run (1979), at 2, Antoine, now divorced, continues his search for romantic fulfillment. The night ends at 4 with The Green Room (1978), based in part on The Altar of the Dead and two other stories by Henry James, in which Truffaut stars as a writer and World War I veteran who spends his life grieving the loss of his young wife.",2013-07-04T19:12:28+0000

The project, a poem written by Geoffrey O. Todd with illustrations by Rich Berner called Back to the Wild, was to chronicle a new adventure in which Max travels with his daughter, Sophie, to see the Wild Things for the first time in 30 years. In the original Kickstarter post, published in May, the authors said they hoped to raise 25,000 (about $37,270) to publish the work and had been very careful not to impinge on Mr. Sendaks copyright and have taken the necessary legal advice around this whole project. HarperCollins Publishers, which published the original book, felt differently. In a legal notice sent to Kickstarter on July 3, the company said, Any such unauthorized sequel would clearly violate the estates right to create derivative works. Before Sendak died last year, at 83, he spoke out against writing a sequel to his 1963 classic in a 2011 video interview with the Web site for the Tate museums in Britain: Go to hell, he said.

The Dark Knight Returns, written and illustrated by Frank Miller, was published in 1986, and it, along with Watchmen, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, ushered in a new sophistication in comic books. The Dark Knight Returns imagines a future Gotham City, where crime and corruption are rampant and Batman comes out of retirement to save it. He also recruits the first female Robin, Carrie Kelley. The Dark Knight Returns prompted a Batman revival that led to a series of movies in the 1980s and 90s and more recently to Christopher Nolans three blockbusters about the character. For fans of modern comics, this drawing is where everything really begins, Todd Hignite, the vice president of Heritage Auctions, said in a statement. He noted that the cover of The Dark Knight Returns No. 3, with Batman and the new Robin, sold for $448,125 in 2011.

I have begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach, he said, adding that he and his staff will participate in training about sexual harassment. Donna Frye, a former city councilwoman who worked for Mr. Filner until April, had asked him to resign, saying she had credible evidence he had sexually harassed numerous women. KPBS, a public radio affiliate, reported that women in Mr. Filners office said they had been groped, kissed and grabbed. ",2013-07-12T03:29:35+0000

(Showtime 2) LIBERAL ARTS (2012) Josh Radnor (How I Met Your Mother), who wrote and directed this film, stars as Jesse, a 35-year-old admissions counselor at a New York City university who returns to his Ohio alma mater, where he encounters his two favorite teachers. The first is Judith (Allison Janney), a bitter, cynical professor of romantic literature, who seduces him, then throws him out of her bed. You didnt think we were going to cuddle while I read you Wordsworth, she says. Put some armor around that gooey little heart. The second is Peter (Richard Jenkins), who is ending a 37-year career at the place he describes as a prison. Then Peter introduces Jesse to Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen, above with Mr. Radnor), an intellectually precocious 19-year-old drama student, and something clicks over the strains of Beethoven, Wagner, Vivaldi and Massenet. Liberal Arts is a much stronger, more deeply felt film than Mr. Radnors debut, Happythankyoumoreplease, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, but, to quote the hard-boiled Judith, Mr. Radnors Jesse is gooey. The harder Mr. Radnor strains to make you love his alter ego, the more resistant you become. The last thing in the world you want to hear is Jesse congratulating himself for growing up, but toward the end of the movie thats exactly what he does, with a gooey happy ending in sight.

It is 1985, and Greta Wells, a photographer living in Greenwich Village, has just suffered two devastating losses: Her twin brother, Felix, has died of AIDS and her lover, Nathan, has left her for another woman. Thrown into a deep depression, she consults a psychiatrist, who in turn sends her to Dr. Cerletti, an advocate of electroconvulsive therapy. Will it change me? Greta asks, before her first session. Not at all, Miss Wells, he replies. What has changed you is your depression. What were trying to do is bring you back.",2013-07-12T15:00:43+0000
us,Rites of Passage,"The British author Tim Parks has lived in Italy since 1981, commuting on his adopted countrys vast, various and ever changing networks of trains from Verona (where he first made his home) to Milan (where he now lives and still teaches). Parks was for many years married to an Italian and has three children, all born in Italy. He has written more than a dozen novels and 10 other books, including a handful of funny, appreciative and grousing memoirs about the particolari of daily life, Italian style. In the first of these, Italian Neighbors, he asked the reader to picture him as a busy but inexpert fellow dashing about the narrow confines of his territory waving a net on the end of a long stick. A huge net, he added. What did he hope to catch? National character, a sense of place, the feeling people, place and weather generate. In his new memoir-cum-travelogue, Italian Ways, Parks enlarges this net to fantastical dimensions in order to bag Italys sprawling, convoluted and (in a way) stupendous railway system and subject it to his scrutiny  on the theory, he explains to skeptics who dont share his train mania, that any culture manifests itself entirely in anything the people of that culture do.",2013-07-12T15:00:52+0000

Others, who stayed on, were dislocated from their history as the Communist authorities rewrote the past, a process that continued during the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s.

Now another Star Wars spinoff is making noise: William Shakespeares Star Wars, by Ian Doescher, is new at No. 12 on the hardcover fiction list. The book recasts the story of Luke and Leia and Darth Vader as a five-act play in iambic pentameter  because why not?  and its more entertaining than you might guess. (Heres a sample couplet from the prologue: In time so long ago begins our play / In star-crossed galaxy far, far away.) In a phone interview, Doescher told me he came up with the idea last year, after watching the original Star Wars trilogy and attending the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in quick succession. People ask me whether I see Star Wars as a comedy or a tragedy, he said, but its really neither  its partly a history, like Henry V, and partly a fantasy, like The Tempest.  He added that he was gratified, but not entirely surprised, by the books success: Shakespeare is a popular market, and Star Wars is a popular market, he said.

It came out of being tired of performances that were really hard to watch, Ms. Ottinger said in an interview. We wanted to make an enjoyable way for people to watch artists work that is in progress. The latest installment, part of the Brooklyn International Performance Art Festival, takes place at Brooklyn Fire Proof, with two free shows on Saturday. Audience members are led from one performance area to the next as several artists, including Kaia Gilje, Paige Fredlundand Leeza Meksin, show static and movement-based work. The series, which started last fall, makes watching experimental art a pleasure. But for its producers, TAB is also a research project dealing in perception: How does one guide others into watching multiple art forms at once? They have a magic touch. TAB, unpretentious and refreshing, is every bit a summer tonic. (Saturday, 4 and 6 p.m., doors open at 3; 119 Ingraham Street, at Porter Avenue, Bushwick; tabartbrooklyn.com.)

(Starz) CELESTE AND JESSE FOREVER (2012) Rashida Jones portrays Celeste, and Andy Samberg (above, with Ms. Jones) is Jesse, a young married couple in Los Angeles who have split up without moving on or out in this wistful romantic comedy for which Ms. Jones wrote the screenplay with Will McCormack. She plays a hard-driving trend forecaster who lives in the house they once shared; he is a laid-back artist who now flops in the backyard studio. Though they are best friends bound by the same adolescent humor, Jesses lack of ambition doesnt allow the focused Celeste to stay with him. But she cant quit him, either  until suddenly she must. While Celeste and Jesse is decidedly conventional in most respects, its pretty swell as an exploration of a relationship between a man and a woman thats no longer predicated by mutual desire, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Once upon a studio time, screwball comedy was where men and women redefined gender relations, she added. Equality between the sexes, or so it seems, turned out to be a joke killer, one reason bromances exist: if you cant imagine women as equals, just sidestep them. Here, she said, Ms. Jones and Mr. McCormack have righted the sex imbalance of the bromance with a story about two people who, together and alone, express an ideal rarely seen in American movies: a man and a woman whose equality is burnished in friendship, not just in bed and marriage.

Matt Damon is Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbok rugby team, a source of Afrikaner pride despised by most blacks  and the vehicle, Mandela thinks, for bringing the countrys races together. A. O. Scott, reviewing this film in The New York Times, wrote that Mr. Freeman played Mandela  a role that earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor  with gravity, grace and a crucial spark of mischief, and that Mr. Damon, nominated for best supporting actor, matches him with crisp, disciplined understatement (and utter mastery of a devilishly tricky accent). He added: Invictus has implications beyond its immediate time and place that are hard to miss.

When we first meet Anais she is handcuffed in the back of a police car, her school uniform covered in blood, on her way to an institution for young offenders. She has no family, and has never seen so much as a photograph of any relatives. Her hobbies include joy riding, tripping on school days, painting CCTV cameras fluorescent pink and hand-delivering the lights from police cars, covered with glitter, to the desk of her local constabulary. Now 15, she still feels 2 years old and ready tae bite. She is, in summary, totally and utterly messed up  but I like pillbox hats.",2013-07-18T21:04:55+0000

At the start of his reign in the fifth century B.C., Goujians archenemy attacked his kingdom, captured Goujian and made him a slave. The king was granted amnesty after three years and allowed to reclaim his throne. But Goujian swore off the trappings of monarchy, eating peasant food and living simply. He slept on a bed of brushwood and dangled a gallbladder from the ceiling, licking it to taste its bitterness every day. A Chinese aphorism, sleeping on sticks and tasting gall, celebrates his determination to remember the shame and humiliation he suffered  and to draw strength from it.",2013-07-18T21:06:31+0000

Judge Michael P. Shea said he was deferring to a request for immunity for Mr. Zedillo submitted by the State Department last year. The two-year-old lawsuit had sought $50 million in damages against Mr. Zedillo, who now leads a research institute at Yale University. Members of the indigenous group that was the target of the assault, known as Las Abejas, or the Bees, said they did not know the plaintiffs and disassociated themselves from the suit. Mr. Zedillo was president in 1997 when paramilitary gunmen fired on members of the group taking refuge from fighting in the southern state of Chiapas and killed 45 people, including 18 children.

(TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRANOIS TRUFFAUT A monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director, and mainstay of the French New Wave, continues with The Soft Skin (1964). The movie shows Alfred Hitchcocks influence on Truffaut, and his own preoccupation with the romantic triangle, through the story of a literary scholar (Jean Desailly), his wife (Nelly Benedetti) and the flight attendant (Franoise Dorlac) who comes between them. The lineup continues at 10 with Jules and Jim (1962), adapted from Henri-Pierre Rochs 1953 semi-autobiographical novel and starring Jeanne Moreau as a tempestuous beauty who drives a wedge between college friends (Henri Serre, above center, and Oskar Werner, with Ms. Moreau). In Two English Girls (1972), at midnight, a young writer (Jean-Pierre Laud, who served as Truffauts alter ego as a young man) carries on love affairs with two sisters (Kika Markham and Stacey Tendeter). Truffaut shares the directing credit with Jean-Luc Godard in A Story of Water (1961), a short film inspired by a severe flood in Paris, at 2:15 a.m. And in The Woman Next Door (1981), at 2:30, former lovers (Grard Depardieu, whom Truffaut chose as his stand-in during his later years, and Fanny Ardant, Truffauts real-life love at the time) find themselves unexpectedly reunited after seven years as neighbors in a French village. The marathon wraps at 4:30 with The Man Who Loved Women (1977), with Charles Denner as an inveterate womanizer (the beauties are portrayed by Brigitte Fossey, Nelly Borgeaud, Genevive Fontanel and Leslie Caron, among others) who tries to make sense of his problems by writing his memoirs.",2013-07-19T05:00:07+0000

(HBO) THE BOURNE LEGACY (2012) Jeremy Renner (above), replacing Matt Damon as the lead in this fourth installment, stars as the superspy Aaron Cross, on the run when the secret intelligence campaign (code name: Outcome) that produced him is compromised, leaving Cross and his fellow operatives to be eliminated under orders from a retired Air Force Colonel (Edward Norton). Rachel Weisz plays the geneticist who helped to create Cross and who may be his only hope for staying alive. While the director Tony Gilroy retains some of the Bourne bequest, hes also created a tricky parallel universe with a new agency that has its own clenched-jawed, closed-door complications and a hero who nearly becomes lost among them, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about these films inspired by the Robert Ludlum novels. But while some of the action here flows nicely, she added, the three previous movies conveyed a sense of urgency that mirrored Bournes shattered being and his propulsive, convulsive journey from unenlightened self-interest to accountability, from the existential question mark of his identity to a hard moral reckoning. Jason Bourne was still trying to find the answers, she said. Now with Bourne gone, Mr. Gilroy needs to find other questions worth asking. The Bourne Identity (2002), the first film in the series, will be shown on A&E at 8; The Bourne Supremacy (2004), the second, will be shown on Starz at 7:05.",2013-07-20T05:00:05+0000

(Fox) AXE COP A sneak peak of Animation Domination High-Def, a late-night programming block overseen by Nick Weidenfeld, an alumnus of Adult Swim, begins with this adaptation of the Internet comic created by the brothers Malachai and Ethan Nicolle when they were 5 and 29, respectively, about an ax-wielding hero, above, (voiced by Nick Offerman) who sleeps two minutes a night, subsists on birthday cake and battles villains. Its a nonsensical but inventive and purely entertaining takeoff on superhero tales , Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. The animation is serviceable, and the show gets a vital boost from the voice performance of Nick Offerman, whose mock solemnity works as well for a mildly fascistic superhero as it did for a middle-American bureaucrat in Parks and Recreation. High School USA!, at 9:45, a broad and dull spoof of the Archie gang created and written by Dino Stamatopoulos, best known for playing Star-Burns on Community, slides down the wall quickly, Mr. Hale added.

Not all mischaracterizations of Heisenbergs principle are as innocent as Eppess. The film What the Bleep Do We Know!? uses it to justify many articles of faith in New Age philosophy. Asserting that observing water molecules changes their molecular structure, the film reasons that since we are 90 percent water, physics therefore tells us that we can fundamentally change our nature via mental energy. Fundamentally inaccurate uses of the principle are also common in the academy, especially among social theorists, who often argue that it undermines sciences claims to objectivity and completeness. As Jim Holt has written, No scientific idea from the last century is more fetishized, abused and misunderstood  by the vulgar and the learned alike  than Heisenbergs uncertainty principle.

Manufacturers of generic versions of the pill can apply to the F.D.A. for permission to sell their versions in drugstore aisles, instead of behind a pharmacy counter. Even if the approval is granted they would not be able to sell their products to those under 17 until the three-year exclusivity period for Plan B One-Step ends. Plan B One-Step retails for about $50; generics sell for at least $10 or $15 less. The F.D.A. decision Monday night follows the governments decision last month to comply with a federal court order to lift age and sale restrictions on Plan B One-Step, which had been available without a prescription only for ages 17 and older.

The agreement, outlined in a consent decree filed in federal court in New York City, ends a long legal battle and could bring a new day for people isolated in inadequate, for-profit residences that make their disabilities that much harder to bear.

He said it was the first time that a Chinese military plane had flown between the islands, though Chinese warships frequently sail between them to reach the Pacific. The episode comes amid a lingering dispute between the two countries over islands they both claim, and amid what appears to be a semiofficial campaign in China to question Japans rule of Okinawa, part of an island chain that had paid monetary tribute to imperial China.

Giovanni Ribisi is the narrator, a grown version of one of the adoring boys with whom the sisters communicate in their isolation by means of light signals and songs over the phone.
