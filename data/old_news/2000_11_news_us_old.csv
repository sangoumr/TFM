Kevin died at Calvary Hospital on October 30, from kidney cancer. Kevin will long be remembered for his 27 years of utmost dedication to LESC. Kevin first joined LESC in 1973, as a vocational supervisor. In 1974, he was promoted to Administrator of Residential and Day Treatment at Su Casa. In 1978, he was promoted to Administrator of LESC and subsequently Senior Vice President. In his final years, Kevin oversaw the Su Casa renovations and while his involvement was increasingly peripheral, he considered his limited participation a welcome distraction from his illness. He often expressed a wish to see the renovation through to completion, but, in time, recognized that his dream would not be realized. In loving memory of Kevin and his deeplyfelt commitment to this project, at Su Casa's grand reopening ceremony, LESC plans to name the newly renovated facility ''The Kevin Quinn Building'' In this way, he will remain an integral part of Su Casa's history and future. His love and devotion to his family and the joy and light he brought to all who knew and worked with him will be deeply missed and remembered always.

The Web site is expected to include more than 2,600 sales listings and between 550 and 1,000 rental listings from about 120 companies, according to the brokerage concerns. For the first time, Manhattan brokerage firms have agreed to share all listings. The firms agreed to share the information within 72 hours and appoint an 18-member board of directors that includes the president of the Real Estate Board of New York as a nonvoting member. The officials said they hoped to make technological advances to speed up the sharing of listings. The agreement ends months of bickering between the two groups -- one led by Douglas Elliman and the Corcoran Group, the other made up of smaller brokerage firms. The new service will use the smaller group's Web site address -- nymls.com -- until a permanent name is chosen. Present at the announcement of the new Internet venture were (pictured from left to right): Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York; the Corcoran Group's founder and chairwoman, Barbara Corcoran; Douglas Elliman's chief executive officer, Alan J.

Tedlow, a member of the board for more than 24 years, who served as a managing director for 10 years and was an honorary director at the time of his death. A courtly, kind and gentle man, he gave devoted service to The Metropolitan Opera as a member of the finance committee and chairman of the audit and nominating committees during important years of transition for our company. Together with his beloved wife Lillian, Ted set a leadership example for other good friends of the Met through his quiet generosity to our activities for nearly four decades. As patrons of the Met since the company moved to the new Opera House at Lincoln Center in 1966, Ted and Lillian were founding members of the Golden Horseshoe Program and the Encore Society and participated in creating our first endowment campaign and the Pooled Income Fund, the Silver Anniversay Fund, and the new campaign to increase our endowment fund. We recall with deep affection Ted and Lillian's enjoyment of opera at the Met. Together they took special pleasure in underwriting two new productions, ''Les Contes D'Hoffmann'' in 1973 and ''Rigoletto'' in 1977, as well as helping to underwrite nine other productions, even during recent years when ill health prevented them from attending Met performances. We will miss Ted's wise counsel and his abiding support of our company as well as his personal friendships with many of us on the board and in Met management. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Lillian, his sons, Richard and David, his daughter, Roberta Rood, and his family. Mrs. Gilbert W.

us,Israel and Palestine Set Stage for Truce," Israel pulled back tanks from friction points and Palestinian police restrained rock throwers Thursday, in first tentative steps to carry out a truce agreement reached by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in an overnight meeting. The cease-fire was to take hold Thursday afternoon with announcements by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. However, in the hours leading up to the deadline, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed in a rock-throwing clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank village of Hizme, near Jerusalem, and Palestinian gunmen fired on Israeli positions in the West Bank town of Hebron, drawing return fire. Clashes also erupted in the Gaza Strip. But in at least two locations, near the Jewish settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim in Gaza, Palestinian police pushed back rock throwers for the first time in several weeks. Near Netzarim, police bundled several dozen stone throwers in trucks and drove them away. Previous cease-fire agreements, including one brokered by President Clinton last month, did not hold, with each side accusing the other of violating commitments. Peres and Arafat met at the Palestinian leader's Gaza City office for two hours late Wednesday in the first high-level meeting since the conflict erupted Sept. 28. At least 162 people have been killed in the fighting, most of them Palestinians. ""We hope we shall have two or three days without funerals,"" Peres told Associated Press Television News. ""We shall return to normalize the situation in the territories and return to peace talks."" Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath said that according to the understandings reached, Israel will gradually lift its closure of Palestinian areas, permit Palestinian workers to return to jobs in Israel and open Gaza International Airport, as well as border crossings with Egypt and Jordan. Such restrictions have cost the Palestinian economy about $4 million a day, the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday. Arafat convened his Cabinet ministers around noon. In an apparent call for calm, the Palestinian Information Ministry said in a statement that ""the Palestinian leadership asks our Palestinian people and all our national forces to forge a united stand and express ourselves peacefully in all circumstances in our national struggle."" But the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said the Palestinian uprising against Israel would continue. Yassin said the protests were an expression of popular anger and could not be reined in by an order from Arafat. Barak and Arafat spoke by phone before the 2 p.m. deadline to coordinate the wording of their announcements, which were to be broadcast live by Israeli and Palestinian media, respectively, Barak's office said. Barak also expressed sorrow for the killing of the Palestinian teen-ager Thursday. Israeli security officials, meanwhile, announced that a Palestinian militant has been caught in the Israeli town of Upper Nazareth. The officials said the man had plotted to carry out a suicide attack in northern Israel. On Thursday morning, Israel pulled back tanks from several friction points in the Gaza Strip, including the Karni crossing, where eight Palestinians were killed in two days of fierce gun battles. One of the Karni protesters died Thursday of injuries sustained earlier. Israeli soldiers withdrew from a Palestinian police post at Karni which they had seized earlier this week. Israel also lifted its siege of several West Bank towns, including Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron. Within a few hours, Palestinians were to be able to move freely in the West Bank, said Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the Israeli army spokesman. Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders and lower-level officers held a series of talks in the West Bank and Gaza to work out the details of the truce. As a result of the agreement, Israel at the last minute froze attacks on Palestinian targets that were to come as retaliation for the killing of three Israeli soldiers in gun battles with Palestinians on Wednesday. The three soldiers were the first to die in combat since Oct. 1. Seven Palestinians were also killed, as armed clashes intensified in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the conflict appeared to be spiraling out of control. Denouncing what he called ""grave escalation initiated by the Palestinian Authority,"" Barak convened a special session of his Cabinet late Wednesday and ""decided on a number of appropriate steps,"" a statement said. But the Peres-Arafat meeting led to the decision to hold the fire. Each side has blamed the other for the violence. Israel says its forces have responded with restraint to Palestinian attacks. The Palestinians charge that Israel has used excessive force in putting down demonstrations. A pitched battle was fought Wednesday in the village of Al Khader, near Bethlehem, where two Israeli soldiers and three Palestinians were killed Wednesday. Four Israeli soldiers were wounded. Heavy Palestinian gunfire prevented Israeli forces from reaching the soldiers who were hit, so the Israelis sent attack helicopters to rake the village with machine guns while tanks provided covering fire for an armored vehicle to retrieve the soldiers. Israeli attack helicopters and tanks fired at Palestinian intelligence headquarters in Jericho overnight, in retaliation for Palestinian gunfire at an Israeli army outpost where a reserve army officer was killed, the military said.

By early evening rescue workers were still struggling to free one person trapped under the rubble, a firefighter said. The explosion occured at 5:08 P.M. (0808 GMT) at a plant operated by Tanil Chemical Co in the industrial city of Ansan, about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of Seoul, firefighters said. They said the explosion engulfed the plant and a nearby plastics factory in flames. ""The fire was extinguished at around 7 o'clock (1000 GMT),"" Kim Young-jin, a firefighter at the Ansan Fire Station, told Reuters. ""No toxic gases were leaked."" The cause of the blast was not immediately known. Local YTN television earlier reported toxic gases were believed to have leaked from the plant after explosion. Kim said rescue workers pulled three people from the rubble who were later taken to a nearby hospital.

Ambulances raced to the Mahane Yehuda market, which sells food, vegetables and clothing in Jewish west Jerusalem. Huge plumes of black smoke rose into the sky. Israel TV said that the two people killed were the bombers, but the report could not immediately be confirmed. The blast came shortly before Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were scheduled to make separate announcements of steps toward a cease-fire -- an effort to stop more than a month of fighting that has left at least 162 people dead, most of them Palestinian. An Israeli soldier, Oshri Atun, said he saw a white sedan being chased by a police van with sirens wailing. The car turned into a side street, and seconds later the bomb exploded, Atun said. Another witness, who only gave his first name, John, said he heard a powerful blast. ""When I looked down the street, there was a big fire and people were hurt,"" he said. There was no immediately claim of responsibility. However, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have said they would carry out new terror attacks in Israel. The leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, has said the Palestinian uprising against Israel would continue. Yassin said the protests are an expression of popular anger and could not be reined in by an order from Arafat. Also, Israeli army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey said Thursday he had detailed warnings about attacks, and Israeli security forces have been on high alert for the past few weeks. For years, the market -- spread over several blocks of a predominantly religious neighborhood -- has been a choice target for those trying to sabotage peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It was the scene of a car bomb in November 1998 that killed two suicide bombers and wounded 21 other people. Hamas claimed responsibility. And in July 1997, two militants blew themselves up in the area, killing themselves and 16 shoppers. Dozens have been killed at the market since the 1960s. Palestinian militants with explosives strapped to their bodies have blown themselves up in the narrow, cobblestone lanes or detonated car bombs on the larger streets. The market is closed off to vehicular traffic during shopping hours. ",2000-11-02T05:00:00+0000

It was moving at 19 kph (12 mph) westward and was expected to pass about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of metropolitan Manila on Friday, said the weather bureau, which raised high storm alerts over about a dozen provinces on the eastern side of the Philippines. Last week, typhoon Xangsane plowed through the main island of Luzon, knocking down power lines, flooding many provinces north of Manila and stranding thousands of commuters, some for two days, on flooded roads. In its latest report, the office of civil defense said Xangsane left 40 people dead, 249 injured and 54 missing. In addition, the coast guard said 12 crew members of a fishing boat not listed by the civil defense office remained missing after their boat sank Sunday off La Union province northwest of Manila. The civil defense office said 1.3 billion pesos (dlrs 25 million) worth of property and infrastructure had been damaged and more than 118,000 people were forced to flee their homes because of typhoon damage and flooding in provinces north and southeast of Manila. After leaving the Philippines early this week, Xangsane moved north toward Taiwan, where flights were canceled and classes suspended. Officials said at least 53 people died and 10 were missing in the island's worst flooding in three decades. A Singapore Airlines plane crashed while taking off Tuesday night in heavy winds and rain from Taipei's airport, killing at least 81 people. ",2000-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Rashid designed the 1,500-square-foot gallery and stars in its first show, with furniture (including the Soft Lamp, left, $1,560) and digital art. The cutout wall forms a small space that is ''sensual but minimal at the same time,'' Mr. Rashid said. The Totem Gallery is at 83 Grand Street (near Wooster Street).",2000-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Born and raised in Plainfied, N.J., he had a long and distinguished career in the real estate and publishing industries, complimented by extensive commitment to numerous community and charitable undertakings that were dear to his heart. Stuart will long be remembered for his love of life, great wit, caring and compassion toward others and deep love of books, but above all family was the centerpiece of his life. A devoted husband to Maxine Kunitz Hirsch for 46 years, he was the loving father of two children, Chuck Hirsch of Seattle, WA. and Robin Friedman of Montgomery Twp, N.J., and daughter-in-law Carol and son-in-law Jeff. He was an adoring grandfather to Hannah and Lily Friedman. Also survived by his brother Simon Hirsch of Allentown, PA. He attended both Muhlenberg College and Rutgers University and served with the U.S. Army in the Korean Conflict. Upon his return to Plainfield, he joined into partnership with J.J. Schwartz and Company, a real estate firm. Later he changed the course of his career by joining the publishing giant Simon and Schuster at 36 years old. He thrived in this environment, immediately assuming responsibility for sales for the greater New York region, rising to the position of National Sales Manager. During his tenure with the company, his sales and marketing expertise helped insure the best selling status of some of the most prominent authors of the past century. In retirement he served as Chairman of the Board of Managers and President of the Volunteer Guild of Runnells Hospital in Berkeley Heights, N.J., devoted ten years as a volunteer at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. and participated actively as a member of the New Providence Rescue Squad, Board of Adjustment, Board of Health and of the Summit Old Guard. He was widely admired for his warm and engaging personality, and his deep knowledge of, and interest in books, politics, sports and family.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  CHRZANOWSKI, GERARD, MD.","CHRZANOWSKI - Gerard, MD. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Dr. Gerard Chrzanowski's graduation from The William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute. Given that he had a talent for both contributing to and extracting from any given day, twice as much as most mortals, he can with modesty be given credit for one hundred years of extraordinary service to the repair of human hurts and to the needs of the lay and professional communities on the local, national and international levels. Acknowledged as a forceful and brilliant teacher, supervisor, psychoanalyst, and author, his apparently limitless energy and irrepresible creativity made him a formidable and peripatetic presence in countless professional endeavors of exceptional distinction. Gerry founded the Bleuler Clinic over fifty years ago; he co-founded the International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies in 1962; he served actively and with distinction in the American Academy of Psychoanalysis; and he wrote a seminal book on interpersonal psychoanalysis. Dr. Chrzanowski was the recipient of many awards of which two were the White Institute's Certificate of Appreciation in 1977, and the IFPS ''award for lifelong dedication to psychoanalysis'' in 2000. As a determined agent for growth and a man of fierce loyalties and strong opinions, Gerry willed himself and others to face head-on the challenges of life and to triumph. Unencumbered by reticence, he nonetheless had an infinite capacity for patience, kindness and compassion. Gerry's understanding, love and devotion was returned in full measure by his many colleagues, analysands, supervisees, family, friends and others whose lives were enriched by his unique array of talents. His vision will be carried by a profoundly grateful Institute and Society on which he left his salient, striking and indelible mark.

MP3.com, which is liable for over $100 million in damages, is contesting the validity of several thousand of Universal's copyrights on the ground that sound recordings are not works made for hire. That designation has long been a source of friction between artists and record labels, because unlike other copyrights that return to the artist after 35 years under the copyright law, the underlying copyright of a work made for hire never reverts back to its original author. But there has been no authoritative legal judgment on the status of sound recordings.

us,Ecce Bandwidth," Amoney manager once explained to me the attraction of the Gilder Technology Report newsletter. He didn't subscribe for the stock tips: George Gilder is wrong as often as he is right about individual companies. But Gilder tends to be on the money about trends or entire technological sectors. Such acumen, it appears, is in short supply. Thus his popularity with the plutocratic set. That, and his politics. Gilder is the original supply-side evangelist -- his book ''Wealth and Poverty'' (1981) influenced Reagan administration economic policy. And as he writes in ''Telecosm,'' his new book, ''The rich provide the investment and the rest reap the rewards.'' Gilder has married his technological perceptiveness with a libertarian brand of anti-government antagonism so right-wing as to make William Buckley blush. From the robber barons to Michael Milken to Bill Gates, Gilder never met a megacapitalist he didn't like. One can practically hear the Croesus class wishfully thinking: if he's correct about high-tech, then he's probably got the goods on politics, too! Not to mention the proper relationship between men and women. Gilder also happens to be the author of ''Men and Marriage'' (1972), an antifeminist polemic that got him named ''male chauvinist pig of the year'' by Time magazine. Gilder's tune seems not to have changed all that much. He writes in ''Telecosm'' that in the utopian future, while the husband gets stock news as he shaves, his wife will be grocery shopping online. Gilder should stick to technology. He's cute when he throws around words like ''petahertz'' and ''petabit'' and ''add/drop multiplexers'' and ''dispersion compensation modules.'' His enthusiasm is like that of a 2-year-old staring at zoo animals for the first time -- easy to share, hard to disagree with. But when he scorns big government he's not just boring and predictable -- he's whiny, and surprisingly halfhearted. In a chapter on Netscape and the birth of the Web that wearily covers old ground, his critical treatment of Microsoft's ultimate Web browser triumph is limited to putting the word ''monopolistic'' in quotation marks, as if the punctuation alone were enough to undermine any hint that Microsoft didn't play fair. Such rhetorical flourishes work only when you are preaching to the converted. And Gilder does deliver a good sermon. Miracles and transcendence abound in Gilder's telecosm -- his universe of fiber optic light, all glimmery with ''cornucopian radiance.'' God, angels, the Bible -- they all make appearances. It's no accident that the book's last word is ''divine.'' Gilder's got a gospel to spread -- the gospel of unlimited bandwidth. His book's unifying principle is that we are all destined to be brought together into ''networks of light linking cathedrals of mind.'' When Gilder focuses on the engineers who have delivered this ''promethean light'' he is engaging. When he zeroes in on individual companies, however, as he does in this book's latter half, he tends to sound like an annual report. But the book's main weakness is neither Gilder's exuberance nor his distaste for government meddling. The real problem is that his gospel has already been spread, most notably by himself. If the name Gilder and the word ''telecosm'' sound vaguely familiar, that's not surprising. ''Telecosm,'' the book, was first promised to readers as far back as 1993. Meanwhile, Gilder has been pounding out his passions in magazine articles, columns and endless lectures. He's impossible to avoid. It would be petty to blame Gilder for the delays. It's hard to keep up in the 21st century, as Gilder would be the first to acknowledge. No sooner have you hailed the ascendancy of a new paradigm than you're scrambling for cover as your latest metastructure crumbles in the face of yet another. Maybe Gilder is right. Maybe unlimited bandwidth will usher in an era of unlimited prosperity. But reading ''Telecosm'' you may find yourself asking, ''Yeah, and so what else is new?''

The lease is for $65,000 per acre a year, said Richard Larrabee, director of port commerce for the agency, putting its total value at $308 million. P&O will spend an additional $150 million through 2001 dredging berths and upgrading cranes and other equipment. The site had been occupied by Maersk-Sealand, which signed its own 30-year lease to consolidate its operations at the nearby Elizabeth-Port Authority Marine Terminal. The P&O Group plans to combine two subsidiaries, P&O Nedlloyd and P&O Ports, both of London, to form a new company, Port Newark Container Terminal L.L.C., to run what will be P&O's first container port in the United States, Ray Venturino, a company spokesman, said. The new operation will be able to handle 800,000 shipping containers annually, compared with the 2.5 million containers that moved through Port Newark in 1999, a 7 percent increase, the port agency said.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; At Home With the Shakespeares,"Originally published in England in 1993, Robert Nye's witty novel, MRS. SHAKESPEARE: The Complete Works (Arcade, $23.95), purports to give us an intimate view of the playwright and poet from the perspective of his wife, Anne Hathaway. Anne knows she has a hot property on her hands, but she seems not to understand precisely why; everything about her husband interests her with the exception of his works, which she claims not to have read. ''Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?'' the poet asks his mate. ''No thanks!'' she replies. This manic humor, already familiar from Nye's novel ''The Late Mr. Shakespeare,'' is like a nervous emanation from a too firmly established canon; even so, some of the jokes are very good indeed. Nye is at his best when the material is most bawdy. The question of Will Shakespeare's sexuality -- and its function in the sonnets -- is finally resolved, at least in fiction. Anne's voice is perhaps too various for a single character; at times she sounds like someone from our own century (''She must be some sort of sonnet-freak''), at others a self-congratulatory Elizabethan shrew (''Am I right? I am''). For a person who hasn't read her husband's works, Anne is surprisingly conversant with what they contain (''I know a hawk from a handsaw''). Scholarly topics are not entirely avoided; when Anne wants to comment on a play, she attributes her opinions to her daughter Susanna. Now and then, as if inadvertently, Anne speaks in a more serious tone that nearly reaches critical mass: ''Did Mr. Shakespeare think that his dream of the maypole must always be more perfect than the dance?'' ''Mrs. Shakespeare'' is funny, irreverent and fearless. William Ferguson.",2000-11-05T05:00:00+0000

This was long before he began writing cookbooks and, through them, influencing thousands of readers and a generation of cookbook writers. When I first met him, in the late 60's, he was a designer, and he lived in the East 40's in a duplex that was one of those places you walked into and wanted to live in; everyone felt this way. Every single object in it was simple and beautiful. The glasses were beautiful. The wooden-handled knives and forks were beautiful. The seersucker napkins were beautiful, and what's more, they didn't have to be ironed. Everything was white, or beige, or sometimes gray, and fantastically easy on the eyes. In fact, right around the time I met Lee, Geraldine Stutz walked into Lee's apartment and wanted to live in it so badly that she hired him to open a small shop at Henri Bendel, the department store she was running at the time; as a result, I was able to buy the very glasses and knives and forks and seersucker napkins I had seen at Lee's, and before long almost everything I too owned was white, or beige, or sometimes gray.",2000-11-05T05:00:00+0000

I clearly remember the day in June when we students took the Pride survey. Because there were only a dozen or so class days before final exams and Regents tests, students were given the survey and told to ''hurry up and finish'' so that we could get back to preparing for the upcoming tests. During the survey, I, along with many of my peers, jokingly wrote in false answers, unaware of the consequences of our actions.

(Any girl could by implication be the first lady, if she played her cards right.) You don't hear that bromide much anymore, perhaps because the idea of the presidency as the pinnacle of American aspiration has been discredited by the behavior and/or ''character'' of the White House's post-Camelot occupants, namely: Lyndon Johnson (postsurgical exhibitionism, arrogant prosecution of an unjustified war, cruelty to beagles); Richard Nixon (enough said); Gerald Ford (clumsiness, sporadic confusion about the politics of Eastern Europe); Jimmy Carter (inability to deal with Congress, off-putting air of piety, embarrassing brother); Ronald Reagan (right-wing demagogy, tendency to narcolepsy); George Bush (bad syntax, pandering to the religious right, vomiting on unsuspecting Japanese); and Bill Clinton (slickness, randiness, unflattering jogging outfits).

But in Mercer Country Superior Court, Judge Andrew J. Smithson ruled that the attorney general's office had been so concerned about calming the political furor surrounding the issue that prosecutors made procedural errors and violated the troopers' rights.

The decline in lobsters over the past two years forced many of Westchester's lobstermen, in Port Chester for example, to dry-dock their lobster traps. Glenn Lopez, a professor of marine ecology at the center, said areas of research would include the western regions of the Sound, especially areas off Westchester, where there was ''almost a total die-off'' in the lobster population over the past year. Until last year, the Sound was the third largest lobster supplier in the Northeast, behind Maine and Massachusetts, with an estimated annual haul of 11 million pounds that generated about $15 million in revenue.

The lights are pointed upward in crevices along the arched interior of the latticed towers, illluminating their grand design, in the manner of the lighting of the Eiffel Tower. The project took Port Authority electricians 18 months of work.

The company, called Knowledge Networks, was trying to address the single greatest problem in polling -- getting a random sample of Americans to answer questions -- by paying a random sample of Americans for their time. In the summer of 1999, Rivers sent out 40,000 letters, most of them containing $10 bills. The money was the teaser for the big offer: spend 10 minutes each week answering his questions over the Internet, and Rivers would give you a free Web TV, free Internet access and a raft of prizes doled out in various contests and raffles. If you were uneasy with new gadgets, Rivers promised to give you not only the TV and the Internet access but also to send an engineer to install the stuff. An astonishing 56 percent of the people they set out to contact took the offer -- compared with the roughly 15 percent now willing to answer questions from a stranger over the telephone.",2000-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Eminent Hollywoodians,"Don Bachardy encountered many Hollywood legends in the company of his longtime companion, the writer Christopher Isherwood. Instead of acting starstruck and polite, Bachardy asked many of them to sit for a portrait. And sit they did -- Bachardy wangled a remarkable number of eminent and often reluctant people, among them Henry Fonda, Alec Guinness, Ingrid Bergman and Ginger Rogers. Fifty-five images from the 1970's and early 80's appear in STARS IN MY EYES (University of Wisconsin, $34.95). Bachardy captured likenesses quite quickly, doing all his drawings in front of the models and never reworking them later. However, the sharpest feature of the book is the writing. Bachardy's journal entries about each session accompany the drawings, and they are full of oddly acute observations. Laurence Olivier looked like a ''frostbitten yam,'' and Mia Farrow's ''vagueness is only an affectation.'' Despite his childhood reverence toward movie stars, Bachardy manages to see them quite unsentimentally. He notices things other artists would not, like the way Ginger Rogers's cluttered house reflected her state of mind. Even though a certain level of deference was required to get him in the door, Bachardy wrote that ''the confrontation between my sitter and me is the subject of my pictures.'' Nowhere is this more evident than in an eight-hour encounter with Bette Davis. Bachardy records that she veered from hospitality to brittle resistance to self-pity, and his recollection is richer than most celebrity profiles you'll read this year.

In 1969 Fred moved to the firm that became Rogers & Wells, now merged in Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells, the world's largest law firm. As a partner at Rogers & Wells Fred created that firm's real estate department, which he chaired until retirement. Fred also received numerous awards lecturing for the Practising Law Institute. Additional community and philanthropic work included 47 years as an active trustee of Louise Wise Services, in New York City, and membership on the Planning Board for the Borough of Hillsdale, NJ. Fred and Helen had their home in Hillsdale from 1950 to 1998, when they moved to Dunwoody Village, in Newtown Square, PA. Fred remained active, playing tennis and serving as treasurer of the Dunwoody residents association until he suffered a stroke in July. Fred is survived by his wife, Helen; his son, Ned, of Vancouver, BC, and his daughter, Mary Gelbart, of Rehovot, Israel; their spouses and four grandchildren; and his sister, Rose Klein, of Elkins Park, PA.

us,QUICK BITE/Highland Park; Mozzarella? Mazel Tov.,"I'm Jewish and I love pizza. So perhaps it was foregone conclusion that I'd wind up at Jerusalem Pizza. The restaurant is a favorite among Highland Park's vibrant Jewish community. As a kosher dairy establishment, it is under the strict supervision of the Vaad Harabanim (Rabbinical Council) of Raritan Valley. As a pizza place, though, it had to meet my own stringent set of standards. I judge all pizzerias by their plain slice; toppings merely cloud the issue. It all boils down to crust, sauce and cheese. Jerusalem Pizza's slice (a reasonable $1.35) passed the test. The traditional New York thin crust was crispy without being too thin. The sauce was rich and tangy. As for the cheese: Pizza cheese draws attention to itself only when there is too much of it or it is just plain bad. Neither was the case, I am glad to report. A whole pizza is $9.95, while a Sicilian pie costs $15.40, and toppings are extra. Remember, it's kosher here, so meat and dairy do not mingle, and pork products -- well, don't even ask. So instead of pepperoni and sausage, you'll find broccoli, eggplant, olives, spinach and more. Pizza-joint perennials ziti and lasagna are joined on the menu by such items as falafel, baklava and a chumus platter ($3.95) that my Gentile friends Sean and Alex greatly enjoyed. Entrees are served from a cafeteria-style line; pizza is ordered at a separate counter. Wash it all down with a Mitzli. That's the name of a ''kosher fruit nectar beverage,'' as well as the Aztec word for cougar. I do not recommend drinking a cougar. The color scheme, just like Israel's flag, is blue and white. Posters and artwork from the Holy Land replace the requisite pizzeria decorations of gondolas and a team photo of Italy's 1982 World Cup champions. What can I tell you? It's a nice nosh.

The subterranean space -- concrete-trussed with a glass-block ceiling -- was a men's public lavatory. The checkerboard marble floor and ceramic tile walls are original. A fake-concrete bar, neon baseboard strip lighting and steel entrance staircase are not. In the shadow of Christ Church, which was designed in 1715 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, the derelict lavatory was redeveloped as a commercial cafe with roughly $290,000 in public and private money. Internet connectivity, plus a lively mix of neighborhood types, including bankers and prostitutes, are part of the space's urban design, said the proprietor, Siraj Izhar, 39, an artist (inset). Mr. Izhar, the organizer of Strike, a collective of English Situationists, who have been staging events in the lavatory since 1992, called Public Life's interactions ''cultural jamming.'' Last month during a drag cabaret act, a fight broke out between two young East End toughs and band members in black stockings.",2000-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Adored husband of Carol Lincoff Prisant and father of Barden. Born in Albany, GA. on May 27, 1935 to Myron and Lillian Prisant, Millard Prisant graduated from Shady Side Academy in Pittsburgh, and Magna Cum Laude from Yale with a degree in Physics. He subsequently attended Harvard Business School, and in 1959 he was made part of the MIT team sent to Cape Canaveral to design and troubleshoot the Polaris missile guidance system. These were among the happiest years of his life, for he was truly one of the original rocket scientists. Mr. Prisant then went on to found Mod-A-Can, Inc., a firm which manufacturers aircraft indicator cases, with branches in New York, Arizona and New Jersey. But, he was not a just theoretician. His great pleasure was in restoring-with his own hands-historic houses. There was no plumbing, electrical or landscape challenge that was beyond his talents. He was President of the Roslyn Preseveation Corp., Chairman of the Roslyn Harbor Planning Board, and Past President of the Roslyn Landmark Society. His was Sabatini's line from Scaramouche, ''He was born with a gift of laughter, and a sense that the world was mad.'' It described him perfectly, but he had, as well, a gentle, sweet, and eternally boyish soul. He was loved greatly. Services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Ave and 75 St, in New York City at 1:15PM Friday, November 10th. Burial will be at the Roslyn Cemetery, Northern Blvd in Roslyn, following the service. Flowers may be sent to Riverside Memorial Chapel, or donations may be made in his name to a charity of one's choice.",2000-11-09T05:00:00+0000

She also held a leading volunteer role at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, chairing the annual Ball of the Roses benefit, and after her husband died in 1977, succeeding as a Trustee until her resignation several years ago. In 1979, she married Dan Platt Caulkins, who died in 1995.

us,Metro Business Briefing; TELEPHONE BACKLOG CLEARED UP,"Verizon Communications says it has cleared up a backlog of nearly 60,000 orders for telephone service that piled up in New York State during a 15-day strike by its workers in August. The company has told the state's Public Service Commission that the backlog of requests for new lines and added features like call waiting was whittled down to 6,000 by the end of September and eliminated altogether by Oct. 23. A backlog of thousands of repair orders in the state ''was pretty much overcome by the end of September,'' William Allan, vice president for regulatory affairs for Verizon in New York, said yesterday. The 4,034 customer complaints lodged against Verizon with the New York Public Service Commission during the first nine months of this year are one-third more than during the comparable period last year. Mr. Allan attributed this to the strike and to the ''wet spring and early summer this year,'' saying damage to cables and other equipment is more frequent with extended rain and flooding. Joseph P.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; 165 Rm Ocean Vu,"In ''Citizen Kane,'' San Simeon was caricatured as Xanadu, Victoria Kastner writes, ''a forbidding, deserted pile, filled with meaningless junk.'' But it was a house (actually four buildings with 165 rooms, two swimming pools on 250,000 acres of land 1,600 feet above sea level) enlivened by William Randolph Hearst's love of the place and by the many colorful guests (not to mention objects) that he and his mistress, Marion Davies, imported to their remote outpost. Construction of San Simeon, now a historical monument run by the California State Parks system, took 28 years (1919-47); the house evolved from Hearst's initial vision of a one-story bungalow into one of the largest private residences in the United States, the repository of Hearst's vast collections of art and furniture. HEARST CASTLE: The Biography of a Country House (Abrams, $49.50) offers a lively narrative documenting the unusually collaborative relationship between Hearst and Julia Morgan, the ''first woman architect of prominence in America,'' according to Kastner, a member of the San Simeon staff. She makes the case that San Simeon, or ''La Cuesta Encantada'' (''The Enchanted Hill,'' as Hearst named it in 1924), was not a ''West Coast anomaly'' but rather a ''representative example of the American country-house tradition.'' The architectural plans, drawings and contemporary photographs that document both the growth of the house and life with Hearst and Davies are accompanied by unusually informative captions that offer an entertaining supplement to the main text.

Designer of the Visitor's Center at Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater. Many of his works are in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art. A passionate gardener, he was as witty in his designs as he was in conversation, and as an art collector, he was both avid and adroit. At ease in all situations, social and intellectual, he was as widely loved for his humor and rousing spirit, as for his compasssion and humanity. No funeral is planned, but a celebration of his life will be held in his New York gardens in the spring.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; A Blessing on Nearly Everything,"The loquacious style of David Kirby's poetry can sometimes resemble the riffs of a brainy stand-up comedian. In the 18 long poems in THE HOUSE OF BLUE LIGHT (Louisiana State University, cloth, $22.50; paper, $14.95), which span anywhere from three to six pages, tragicomical trains of thought run at a frenetic pace. In ''At the Grave of Harold Goldstein,'' for example, the speaker recalls attending a funeral and running across a beloved old friend's gravestone, then jumps to memories of his own would-be juvenile delinquency and the rather hilarious time he and another friend accidentally flipped a Renault upside down in their high school parking lot. All of this finally leads him to ponder his life's purpose amid such chance occurrences, illustrated with a quotation from Woody Allen's ''Stardust Memories.'' Kirby's structure -- stanzas of long, alternatingly indented lines that easily accommodate the cadences of conversation -- contributes to the sense of a casual artistry at work. Yet in relating seemingly autobiographical, spryly digressive sagas about work, marriage, travel and even the joys of mediocre movies, Kirby makes the narrative poem -- a form often proclaimed to be outdated -- amusing, lively and relevant enough for contemporary tastes. While his language is at times gratingly prosaic -- as in the line, ''but it's, like, Milk-Bone time for him'' -- Kirby's strings of lyric vignettes are often inspired. In the title poem, a marvelous meditation on music, fatherhood and death, he writes, ''My son, me, Little Richard, Roy Orbison: / it's a mishmash for sure'' -- but a mishmash wrought of cleverly detailed imagery.

Most productions adhere to strict clauses stating that what one star receives, the others also receive, thereby lessening, but not wholly eradicating, the potential for celebrity trailer envy.

Treacherous invitations to the climber, the precipices also offer a stunning backdrop to the skier exploring the pistes of Val Gardena in Italy as they wind around the jagged peaks.

us,The Pictures; The Fantasy,"At first glance, this looks like a small band of techno-moderns about to be ridden down by an army of ancients. Actually, it's a troop of mounted stuntmen -- costumed as characters from J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' -- thundering down upon the audience with the clang of armor and the muscular reverberation of horses. The fiction embraces the landscape too, as it always does in the movies. These are the mountains of New Zealand's South Island, but they will pass, in darkened, popcorn-scented theaters, as part of the mythic elsewhere that the movies are always making and remaking. This elsewhere is called Middle-earth. Not that long ago, a movie like ''The Lord of the Rings'' would have been filmed on a sound stage or a back lot. There would have been something faintly ludicrous, something hyperbolic about the way perspective marched in recessional across painted flats toward the far horizon, where peaks rose too pointed, too lofty, too softened by distance. The real outdoors gives verisimilitude to what is inherently, doubly and trebly, false. A colossal landscape -- think of Monument Valley in all those rattling old westerns -- does for the movies what it does to us in real life. It establishes scale. It dwarfs and enlarges what is merely human. It contributes an almost peremptory silence to the near-camera heroics of language and gesture. And when the accents waver, the actors falter and the dialogue sounds like soap opera on stilts, the landscape lends a measure of depth and grandeur, mutely imploring us to ignore the fuss in the foreground. -- Verlyn Klinkenborg",2000-11-12T05:00:00+0000

The ability to buy a server machine with the software already installed, he said, will make running a server essentially a plug-and-play experience.

us,Hand Recounts Denied in Florida," Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced Wednesday night she would deny attempts by scattered counties to submit hand recounts of ballots to the results of the contested presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The state's chief elections officer, sharply criticized by Democrats in recent days as a partisan Republican, declared it was ``my duty under Florida law'' to reject requests from several counties to update their totals. Bush holds a 300-vote lead in the state whose 25 electoral votes will settle the presidential election. Harris said the state's vote count would be official when overseas absentee ballots are rolled into the totals by midnight Friday. She noted her decision was subject to an appeal in the courts _ and it seemed likely there would be one. Harris stepped to the microphones to make her announcement seven hours after the 2 p.m. deadline she had set for counties to petition for the right to update their returns. She said four counties had done so _ Democratic-leaning Broward, Palm, Miami-Dade and GOP-leaning Collier _ and she had reviewed their paperwork. ``The reasons given in the requests are insufficient to warrant waiver of the unambiguous filing deadline imposed by the Florida Legislature,'' she said, without further elaboration. The announcement capped a tumultuous day in which the state supreme court refused to stop hand recounts planned or underway in three heavily Democratic counties, but a federal appeals court agreed to consider the Bush campaign's attempt to halt the new canvasses. The federal court's unusually rapid decision to accept the case could launch the controversy firmly on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to intervene came as the major players in the vote count also asked Florida's highest court to settle some of the questions. Secretary of State Katherine Harris led the parade to the Florida Supreme Court with an early-morning lawsuit asking the justices to block the hand recounts at least temporarily, and to consolidate election-related lawsuits. The court turned her down without a hearing. The Bush campaign has fought to stop the recounts on several fronts. Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III argued on Wednesday that the ``process is unfair, gives rise to human error, gives rise to the potential for great mischief.'' Baker lamented the proliferation of lawsuits, saying the situation has ``run amok now.'' Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state chosen to lead Gore's recount, defended the legal strategy. ``We simply must, in order to protect the rights of the vice president in this matter, enable us to take steps that seem warranted,'' Christopher said. In rejecting Harris' suit, the justices, all chosen by Democratic governors, did not address the many other election-related legal challenges making their way through Florida courts. ``Our legal team is reviewing it, but we are certainly pleased the court has ordered that the counts should proceed,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Democrat Al Gore. The Bush camp disputed that interpretation and noted that the state high court's one-paragraph rejection slip did not address the substance of Harris' request. The court left open the option that Harris could sue in a lower state court, or make her arguments another way. The state high court agreed to review complaints from two South Florida counties _ Broward and Palm Beach _ that say they are confused about how to proceed with recounts. Harris and state Democratic Attorney General Bob Butterworth have given the counties conflicting guidance. The counties are suing both. The status of recounts in four counties hand-picked by Democrats shifted quickly: _Officials in Palm Beach, where concerns about the ballot design prompted the Florida dispute, left Wednesday without starting their manual recount. They plan to meet Thursday afternoon to decide how to begin. _Election officials in Broward County reversed course and authorized a hand recount they previously had rejected. The county canvassing board approved the recount 2-1, with the pivotal vote cast by chairman Robert W. Lee, a Democrat and county judge who switched his vote. Republicans lost a court battle to block the recount. _Volusia has already completed its recount and reported it to the state; _Miami-Dade, Florida's largest, has declined a countywide hand recount for the time being. All are heavily Democratic areas where Gore supporters hope to find additional votes for the vice president. In Gadsden County, west of Tallahassee, a new dispute arose after county election officials announced a recheck of more than 2,000 ballots that had been rejected by voting machines gave Gore a net gain of 153. The gain helped whittle Bush's statewide lead to 300 in new figures announced Tuesday. Republicans complained that those disputed ballots should not have been counted; Democrats on Wednesday withdrew a request to review the disputed ballots. The legality of the recounts is being challenged on several fronts by Republicans, while Democrats countered that Florida law allows them. ``Under Florida law, any candidate has a right to get a manual recount,'' Gore lawyer David Boies said. ``What we're saying is: Don't change the rules in the middle of the game, don't shut out the manual recount here when that has been a traditional part of Florida law.'' In Atlanta, the federal appeals court said that all 12 of its judges would hear Bush's challenge to the hand recounts in selected Democratic-leaning counties. Bush lost a similar bid in federal court in Miami earlier this week. Constitutional lawyer Theodore Olson, representing Bush, argued the counts were unconstitutionally selective and arbitrary, because some voters will be treated differently under the law, depending on whether they live in a recount county. The federal appeals court also agreed to hear a related case filed by Florida voters who say they voted for Bush. They also argue their rights are being violated because their counties are not recounting votes by hand. The 11th Circuit Court did not say when it will consider the case, nor whether it would hold oral arguments. The judges could rule based only on their reading of legal briefs due Thursday. Typically, federal appeals courts assign cases to a three-judge panel, which can take weeks or months to hear it. From there, the losing side can ask for a hearing by the full 12-judge court, a request that is usually denied. The court skipped that step. ",2000-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Business Briefing; SECOND WEB-BASED GROCER FAILS,"Shoplink.com, the online grocer serving Westchester County and large parts of Connecticut, announced yesterday afternoon that it had abruptly gone out of business. Shoplink, based in Westwood, Mass., is the second online grocer to announce this week that it was shutting down: Streamline.com, also based in Westwood, said it would close next week. Less than a year ago, online grocery stores were considered to be among the most promising Internet ventures. Earlier this year Shoplink, which opened in 1997, received $37.5 million in investments and, already operating in Rhode Island and Massachusetts as well as in Connecticut and New York, said it hoped to build more than 30 distribution centers across the nation by 2003. But in the last several months, online grocers have increasingly come under attack over their continuing losses. Yesterday, Shoplink said it intended to file for bankruptcy protection. About 30 percent of Shoplink's orders were in the New York region, where the company had about 2,200 of its 5,000 customers. In a letter posted on Shoplink's Web site, the company said orders already placed would neither be billed nor delivered. It also said consumers who sent personal items, like film for processing, should contact either the vendors the company worked with or bankruptcy officials once the company files for protection.

A fall of 0.9 percent in the cost of driving a car was the main reason the index, Britain's principal inflation gauge, slowed. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2000-11-15T05:00:00+0000

A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Wednesday, November 15th, at 11:00am at St. Anthony of Padua Church in Litchfield. Burial will be in St. Anthony Cemetery. There are no calling hours.

Mortara Scholarship Fund, C/O Christine Smith, Georgetown University, 301 Intercultural Center, 37th and O Street, Washington, DC 20057. MORTARA-Michael. It is with shock and disbelief that we acknowledge the untimely death of our Partner and dear friend. As members of the Executive Committee of Salomon Brothers, we worked side by side with Michael during his highly productive years at our firm. He was a major contributor to our firm in the broadest sense. His keen intellect helped to promote the nationwide development of the mortgage backed securities market-today, a cornerstone for the U.S. capital markets. But, his contribution to Salomon Brothers was most apparent in his concern for his fellow partners and colleagues. He was an integral part of the firm's culture during its years of dynamic growth. He deeply cared for and nurtured the people with whom he worked and demonstrated the highest professional standards in every challenge he undertook. While we mourn our loss, it pales in comparison to the loss incurred by his family. To his wife Virginia, and his sons Michael and Matthew, we extend our deepest sympathy. John Gutfreund Allan Fine Gedale Horowitz Henry Kaufman Jim Massey Lew Ranieri Dick Schmeelk Tom Strauss MORTARA - Michael P. The people of Goldman Sachs Group express their heartfelt condolences and prayers to the family of our dear friend and partner. Mike played an important role in the development of the capital markets, and in the management of our firm. His unique talents and quest for innovation will be greatly missed by all who were fortunate to have known and worked with Mike. MORTARA-Michael P. Heather and Steve Mnuchin offer their deepest sympathy to the family of our friend, Michael Mortara: Gina, his wife, and his sons, Michael, Jr. and Matt. MORTARA-Michael P. You have brightened our lives and your light shines on in Gina, Michael, Jr. and Matt. We will miss you and love you forever. Dick and Susan Ebersol, Sunshine, Harmony, Charlie, Willie and Teddy. MORTARA-Michael. It was an honor and a joy to have been a friend of Mike Mortara. He was an extraordinary man. He deeply loved his family. He cared about others. He was a brilliant professional.

Most orders for the recently approved pill are from Planned Parenthood clinics and independent abortion providers, and even many abortion clinics say they think a surgical abortion is better.

Durand. On loan from the New York Public Library and titled ''Kindred Spirits,'' in most ways it's a typical Hudson River School landscape -- jutting cliffs, narrow waterfalls, decomposing conifers. What's unusual is that two urbane figures are recognizable amid nature's sublimity: the painter Thomas Cole and the poet William Cullen Bryant. Durand, Cole and Bryant were all good friends, but more significant, they were part of a close-knit circle of artists and writers -- the first to take root in the new land. And although by today's standards many of the paintings of the period may seem quaint and some of the writing, well, atrocious, broadly speaking the group laid the groundwork for the American Renaissance -- the genius of Whitman, Melville, Thoreau, Hawthorne -- that was to emerge a generation later.",2000-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Ghosts and a Bird Remain,"Bernard Cooper's funny, compassionate, wistful but uneven collection of stories, GUESS AGAIN (Simon & Schuster, $21), traces private moments in the lives of gay men. Several of the 11 narratives are as whispery and circuitous as a faint pulse: in ''Hunters and Gatherers,'' a man's trip to the supermarket to get food for a Mormon couple's potluck dinner leads to a failed relationship with a guy handing out chili samples. Other tales depict moments of shame that bruise forever: a son of a rigid Christian family falls down his house's basement steps while trying to avoid being found molding a penis onto a G.I. Joe doll, or a boy rashly kisses his sister's boyfriend on the lips in what is ostensibly an attempt to mend a wound there. Cooper, who is also the author of ''Truth Serum,'' a memoir, and ''Maps to Anywhere,'' a collection of essays, has a voice that is fluid and engaging. His concern is less with sex than with how people's lives unfold -- often humorously -- in ways they couldn't have anticipated. In the collection's darker moments, the ghosts of dead and absent lovers and alienated family members crowd around the characters' lives, as thick as sand. It's somehow a characteristic moment when in ''Old Birds,'' the final story, the narrator hears the parrot of his lover, Leon, acting out an exchange between Leon and a former partner who is now dead: ''Honey!'' ''What?'' ''Honey!'' ''What?'' This plaintive little fragment of dialogue, preserved in the ether of the bird's voice, reminds the narrator that a deep emotional attachment is like a ''long and urgent conversation,'' and that loving again after loss can be difficult when ''grief and desire have come to seem the same.''

Since he began fixing cars -- ''anything Volkswagen'' -- at a Delran Volkswagen dealership in 1973, Mr. Newtown, 57, has been repairing, restoring and hoarding old Beetles. Mr. Newtown. who commutes from his Willingboro home in a 1987 Volkswagen van, is renowned among enthusiasts of old Beetles as the East Coast's preminent Bug doctor (''There's a guy in New Mexico who's also in Beetles, and there are also people in California making parts''). Cars arrive as rusting corpses on the back of flat bed trucks, or sputter in on their own power, from as far away as Rhode Island and Florida.

But that's not what you heard. What you heard in July 1964, when the song was released and quickly rose to No.1, was essentially what you'd been hearing for half a year or so from the Beatles: the sound of Something New. The jolting, ringing distention of that unusual but not unpleasing chord, and the wisp of silence between its evaporation and the band crashing in with the first verse (''It's-been-a haaaaard daaaay's niiight''), was nothing so much as a sonic articulation of pleasure in the new-wrought and of promise in what would come next. If you were young enough (and white enough and middle-class enough) when you first heard ''A Hard Day's Night,'' it probably did things to you that are hard to talk about. No, not that.

Allen is the investment banker and plutocrat famous for the retreat of bankers and plutocrats he hosts each summer in Sun Valley, Idaho. Both men had been members of the Williams community for a quarter-century or so -- Allen is a prominent alumnus and donor -- and they have houses about a mile apart in the thickly forested Berkshire hills in which the college is nestled, but they had never met; nor was it easy to imagine that they would have anything to say to each other. Taylor was one of those protean figures who vex campus life -- a perverse and provocative thinker, a guru and a troublemaker. He was flirting with an attractive offer from the University of North Carolina, and a former Williams administrator had recruited Allen to see if he could do something about it.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; What He Did in the War,"June Feldman and Tracy Sugarman were Glenn-Miller-and-saddle-shoes college sweethearts who married just before he went off to World War II as a junior naval officer. His war was a slogging time of loading and unloading, plodding the same saltwater trails to deliver men and materiel from England to the threshold of war at the French beaches and channel ports -- a time of never-dry clothing and repetitive work, always redolent of fuel oil, stale sweat and tobacco smoke, and punctuated by occasional combat from D-Day on, as well as by savagely bad weather at sea. At home, June wrote him letters and saved his replies, together with his sketchbooks, stored ''in the cellar of every house we've had'' until the 50th anniversary of D-Day was approaching and they decided to look at them for the first time since Sugarman came home from the Navy in 1945. ''I found my own Baedeker to a time when June and I were both 21, and the war was the only world we knew,'' he writes in MY WAR: A Love Story in Letters and Drawings (Random House, $30). Sugarman's art (he later became a professional illustrator) underscores the affecting and evocative qualities of the book. One sketch leaps off the page, showing an almost fierce-faced teenage swabbie in dungarees, white hat perched resolutely on the back of his head, his waist girdled with a web belt from which hangs a holstered .45 seemingly half as big as he is.

''The red soil was hot and dry and cracked.'' As a cast of animals anticipates an impending storm, Stojic neatly introduces the twin concepts of the five senses and the cyclical nature of weather.

us,Tales of Resistance,"In ''Resistance: Untold Stories of Jewish Partisans,'' a documentary by Kenneth M. Mandel, the forest is the telegenic star, but the most compelling performers are the aging Jews who recount tales of striking back at the Nazis from beneath the kind of canopy few were accustomed to. Mr. Mandel, 53, of West Orange, filmed the forest in gauzy black and white, with sunlit, gently swaying branches that suggest more a haven than a hideout. The Emmy Award-winning documentarian and Newark native filmed the old partisans in color, letting their stories speak for themselves: a doomed mother tells her son to flee the ghetto and avenge her death; a father is forced to hang his own son because another son fled their work camp. Mr. Mandel, who will speak at the debut of ''Resistance'' tonight at 7 p.m. at Temple Tefilo-Israel, 432 Scotland Road in South Orange (admission $18), said the interviews were not cathartic.

Former director of the Nuclear Medicine Service for the Veterans Administration, pioneer in the fields of Endocrinology and nuclear medicine, and devoted husband of the late Beatrix Goldzieher Smith, M.D., died on September 9 in Washington, D.C. He was the first person to describe the uses of ultrasound in medical diagnosis, and the first to describe and demonstrate that alcoholism is a genetic inborn error of metabolism. Dr. Smith showed, also for the first time, the phenomenon of mixed cerebral dominance and metabolic disturbances in patients with dyslexia. He developed innovative and important new approaches to treatment in all these fields. Before moving to Washington D.C., he had an active practice in New York City as well as prominent hospital and university appointments. James Smith was a keenly original thinker and brilliant diagnostician, a compassionate healer who combined analytical and intuitive skills to resolve seemingly intractable puzzles of illness. Forward thinking and visionary, he had a gift for seeing things not only as they were but as they could be. During World War II, Dr. Smith was Chief of Medical Intelligence for the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) in Europe. James J. Smith is survived by two sisters, his children Briged Smith, Jennifer Smith, Andrew Smith, son-in-law Samuel Rubin, and two grandchildren, Clara and Julia Rubin-Smith.

What is most enviable about Old Hollywood is that it was such a tiny little colony that it was easy for talents like these to find one another.

Some have restructured; others have closed up shop entirely. While investors sort out what this means for their portfolios, a large number of former employees -- used to working long hours in high-stress, high-reward jobs -- are left to figure out what it means for their careers. For some of these workers, their dot-com job was the first they ever had; for others, it's the last in a long series of tech-industry postings. So where will they go next? Will they return to the volatile economic sector from which they were just bounced? Or will they go in search of something less cutting edge but more stable? Herewith, a survey of how California's dot-com job seekers are mapping out their future. -- Cate T. Corcoran",2000-11-19T05:00:00+0000

It's the kind of casual absurdity that the film's director, Philip Kaufman, delights in, and ''Quills'' at its best lets him display a graceful wiliness. This story of the Marquis de Sade, adapted by Doug Wright from his play of the same title, isn't exactly a docudrama. It invents elements to make its rather obvious point about the price exacted by art and the state that liberals trying to do what's right can be whipped into.

It was the Shaker tradition of wall-hung chairs, Ms. Crahan said, that inspired the idea of stools that can be removed from the floor. The nine-cube grid, 52 inches square, has birch plywood shelves, and the ultralight fiberboard stools are painted in three glossy shades of blue.

A renowned local, national and international leader, David's dedication to many charitable causes was legendary, and his commitment lives on in the work of many institutions in Israel and his own community of Detroit. He was a UJA National Vice Chairman, member of the Board of Trustees and Campaign Cabinet, and served as Chairman of the Israel 50th Anniversary Committee. He served as International Chairman of State of Israel Bonds, President Emeritus of World ORT Union and President of American ORT Federation.

Locally, he played leading roles as Vice President of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, Chairman of the Federation's Annual Campaign, President of the Jewish Home and Aging Services, President of Congregation Shaarey Zedek, Board Member of Children's Hospital of Michigan, National Co-Chair for Major Gifts at the University of Michigan from which he received an Honorary Doctorate, Chairman of the Special Advisory Council of the Karmanos Cancer Institute, and much more.

Sister-in-law of Sandra Seidlitz and aunt of Matthew, Natalie and Michael Orenstein. Died of ovarian cancer on November 23, 2000 at the age of 48 in Cambridge, MA. Her courage and fortitude in battling the five-year disease were extraordinary. A graduate in English at Brandeis University in 1974, she later obtained a Master's Degree in Special Education at Lesley College.

us,Style; The Legacy,"Throughout her grown-up life, Linda McCartney was the target of some pretty nasty press. Since her death two years ago, many of her most vitriolic critics have conceded that the criticism was unfounded. Principal among her sins seems to have been her decision to accept a marriage proposal from the most sought after Beatle and her reluctance to shave her underarm hair. Her substantial body of work as a photographer (regarded until recently as just celebrity snaps) was eclipsed by her animal activism and outspoken vegetarianism. But a 1987 show of McCartney's work at the Royal Photographic Society in England, followed later by one at the International Center of Photography in New York, helped change the critics' perceptions. And two books of her photographs -- Roadworks'' and ''Sixties: Portrait of an Era'' -- finally established her credentials as a serious photographer.",2000-11-26T05:00:00+0000

With the workers' vaunted stock options nosediving in value, many Amazon workers have begun grumbling about their modest wages, causing them to look more kindly toward unions.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Steichen and His Times,"Often criticized for sentimentality and commercialism and sometimes confused with Alfred Stieglitz, the photographer Edward Steichen has nonetheless left a far-reaching legacy to American culture. He was an early champion of photography as art and, later, of photography as the carrier of humanitarian ideals. The work of major European artists like Matisse and Cezanne were introduced to the United States through his efforts. A consummate technician, Steichen (1879-1973) developed aerial photography during World War I, while his masterly play of glamour and celebrity in commercial photography earned him record fees in the 1930's. From his 15-year tenure as head of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, Steichen wielded great influence, and in 1955 he produced the celebrated photography exhibition, ''The Family of Man.'' In STEICHEN'S LEGACY: Photographs, 1895-1973, (Knopf, $100), Joanna Steichen, the photographer's third and last wife, takes us on a chatty, sometimes catty, and altogether idiosyncratic tour of her husband's life's work. Steichen, then an 80-year-old widower who met the 26-year-old Joanna through his brother-in-law Carl Sandburg in 1959, married her the following year. In this book she has organized more than 300 of his photographs into 19 sections, each with commentary. This abundance of images gives a good picture of Steichen's breadth and artistry -- urban scenes, portraits of financiers, artists and actors, Gorham flatware, propaganda and exquisitely rendered images of plants and flowers. From Joanna Steichen we see what a life force Steichen was, even in his 80's. And from the book's elegant reproductions, we get a good sense of the times that Steichen helped create.

The study also found that people with diagnosable mental illness were about twice as likely to smoke as other people. No firm explanation was offered, but the researchers said that mental illness may make people more vulnerable to nicotine addiction or to tobacco advertising, or that smoking may cause mental illness.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Sounds Good, Feels Bad","In THE FISHER KING (Scribner, $23), Paule Marshall returns to Brooklyn, the site of her best-known novel, ''Brown Girl, Brownstones,'' delivering another moving tale about the complexity of family. It is 1984, and Hattie Carmichael, who now lives in Paris, grudgingly returns to her old neighborhood to attend a jazz concert in honor of the late Everett Payne, known as ''Sonny-Rett,'' a legendary jazz pianist and her former lover. With Hattie is her young charge, also named Sonny Payne, the musician's 8-year-old grandson. Hattie is the boy's ''fathermothersisterbrother,'' as he puts it, the woman who raised him after his grandfather died and his ''runaway girl-mother'' took off after he was born. Hattie is tortured about being back in the old neighborhood. It is, after all, the place that she and Sonny-Rett fled to escape the contempt Sonny-Rett's family felt for his music and the psychic toll of American racism. The visit throws Hattie back into various family rivalries, which are almost as cacophonous as Sonny-Rett's freestyle jazz, described by Hattie as ''a dazzling pyrotechnic of chords (you could almost see their colors), polyrhythms, seemingly unrelated harmonies, and ideas -- fresh, brash, outrageous ideas.'' Though Hattie's memories of the old neighborhood are ugly ones, she is forced to consider whether the solitary, squalid life she and Sonny live in Paris (she works at a seedy nightclub) is really the best life for the boy. As always, Marshall's prose is full of expert dialogue, mellifluous rhythms and sharply drawn portraits of Sonny-Rett's loved ones. Only the abrupt ending disappoints.

Management's final offer to increase wages by $3.30 an hour over six years was rejected; the guild countered by proposing a $3.25 increase over three years.

The numbers are based on the plans of 25 public and private organizations involved in construction. Projected school construction of $3.1 billion over the next two years represented the largest single area. The State Transportation Trust Fund projects $975 million in construction spending over the two years. For the private sector, the New Jersey Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties estimated $2.6 billion in new construction for the two years and New Jersey utility companies said $2.1 billion in construction work would be done.

The ballots, critical to Vice President Al Gore's hopes of overturning a 537-vote lead held by Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the critical state of Florida, were packed into 162 gray metal boxes and loaded onto a yellow Ryder truck for the eight-hour, 450-mile journey to Tallahassee. A state court judge in the capital ordered Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County elections officials to ship more than 1.1 million presidential election ballots to his court as he decides whether to order another recount in the two disputed counties. Democrat Al Gore had asked Leon County Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order that the 14,000 ""undervotes"" from the two counties -- the ballots on which counting machines could not read any vote for president -- be hand-tallied and included in the state's election results. Some had votes that could be detected by human eyes but which were not included in the certified tally that gave Bush, a Republican, a 537-vote lead out of 6 million cast in Florida. Gore hoped to pick up enough votes to overtake Bush and claim the presidency. But Bush's lawyers said any counting should include all the ballots cast in the two counties -- nearly 654,000 in Miami-Dade and 463,000 in Palm Beach County. Both Bush and Gore need the state's 25 electoral votes to win the presidency. Sauls will not decide until Saturday whether the ballots will be hand-counted but he ordered Wednesday that all of them be brought to Tallahassee in case they are needed. The rental truck left the Palm Beach County government offices shortly before 8 a.m. EST, led by a police cruiser and followed by an unmarked car. Palm Beach County elections supervisor Theresa LePore, who oversaw the loading, hugged the truck driver and sheriff's deputies before they left. In Miami-Dade's election office, the sorting and packing was slowed by partisan observers' complaints that election workers were manhandling the ballots, which county officials denied. The Miami-Dade Police Department's SWAT team -- the specially trained and heavily armed squad called out in gunfights and hostage battles -- will pick up that county's ballots Friday for the 10-hour drive to Tallahassee.
