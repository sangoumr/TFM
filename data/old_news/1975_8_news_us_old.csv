us,The Screen: 'Hennessy':Rod Steiger Stars as an Irish Assassin,"A lot of us may have wanted to throw a bomb on occasion but only a few of us have ever set about the task seriously. A bomb thrower is thus different from you and me. Some aspect of his feeling must remain forever mysterious to us, as if he were the sole survivor of an airplane crash. We can speculate on how the wires inside his head are crossed, yet we'll never know for sure.""Hennessy,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, may be aware of that and doesn't speculate much at all about the emotional state of its hero, Hennessy Rod Steiger), who sets off from Belfast to London to blow up the Queen, the royal family, the members of the British Cabinet, the House of Lords and the House of Commons at the state opening of Parliament.The movie does give Hennessy a reason to be angry with Britain. He has just seen his wife and daughter accidentally machine-gunned to death by a British soldier during a demonstration against the continued British presence in Northern Ireland. Hennessy has a reason, all right, but reasons and feelings are not what ""Hennessy"" is all about. It is, instead, a sometimes clever, mostly mechanical suspense melodrama about how Hennessy fails in the nick of time.The film was directed by Don Sharp ""The Face of Fu Manchu"") and written for the screen by John Gay, who did the screenplay for ""Sometimes a Great Notion.""Although it is about a political act, it is as carefully apolitical as an aspirin commercial. Hennessy, who, for the convenience of the story, is a demolitions expert, once had connections with the Irish Republican Army, but his plan to fragment Britain's power structure belongs to no one but himself.Indeed, the movie makes a great point of the fact that as soon as word of the plan gets out, his former I.R.A. associates are no less intent on stopping him than Scotland Yard. ""If he should succeed,"" says one I.R.A. fellow with no irony whatsoever, ""it would set us back 50 years.""Hennessy's assassination plans go along with remarkable ease almost up to the moment of the would-be fatal impact, when he has dressed himself up in the clothes and the identity of a kidnapped M.P. and wired himself with enough explosives to demolish everyone in the Lords chamber.The suspense of the film until this moment has been fairly routine. The concluding sequence, however, is fascinating for the shrewd way in which the fictional footage has been intercut with the newsreel footage, which it perfectly matches. Unless you pay close attention, it does seem as if Elizabeth II looks up from the prepared text of her speech to glower benignly at the interruption caused by the two-footed bomb.This is the only unique aspect of a movie that is otherwise a harmless time-waster. In addition to Mr. Steiger, who seems to be getting rounder with age, ""Hennessy"" featureswithout demonstrating  the talents of Lee Remick, as an I.R.A. widow, and Trevor Howard and Richard Johnson, as Scotland Yard fellows.",1975-08-01T05:00:00+0000

Cars are parked on the roadside, their trunks opened, folding chairs and tables extracted, and an alfresco dining room is set up, usually at a perilous angle, on the grassy shoulder.

Wodehouse called the good old tissuerestorer.",1975-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Remembrances of 'B' Movies Past:Remembrances of 'B' Movies Past,"Outcast gunfighters, Hamlet-like shamuses, father-loved boxers and housewives in heat were the key creations of those fine, mean, muscular movies that studio bosses used to lump under the designation of ""B"" (for Budget). Most critics treated B-movies with freezing contempt, cinastes rarely gave them a second thought and, to this day, only a few maverick film historians have bothered to discuss these quickie classics, which from the early forties through the late fifties could always be caught in derelict metropolitan theaters located between penny arcades and tattoo parlors.The very best of the B's were made on workhouse budgets under coolie conditions by the likes of Val Lewton, Andr de Toth, Rudolph Mate and Roy Rowlandmodest, movie-wise, endlessly inventive craftsmen who would take a hopelessly hack assignment and turn it into 95 fast minutes of sharp detailing, understated performing and hard-nosed truth. They went after action, atmosphere and nervy, offbeat characterization, using their junk material, as the film critic Manny Farber has said, ""to capture the unworked-over immediacy of life before it's been cooled down by art.""Right now, as for the last 20-odd years, hundreds of these shoestring miracles continue to show up on television and continue to be put down by daily and weekly guides as ""quaint archaisms"" or ""just so much celluloid."" To give readers a fair idea of what they're like and how well they've survived the small screen, I offer here, from TV's inventory of canned goods, 10 of my favorite forgotten B-jobs and a moment or two from each of the ten that has stayed with me for years.1. ""D.O.A."" (directed by Rudolph Mate) gives Edmond O'Brien his one right role as a loner-loser dying with each breath from a slow-acting poison meant for somebody else. He spends his last hours and energies hunting his not-quite murderer, encountering the bad, the worse and the implacably malign in a San Francisco whose benign, placid backgrounds vindictively counterpoint his mounting grief and rage. But ""D.O.A."" is no ""Odd Man Out,"" no metaphor for the modern world; its power is derived from the central image of one chunky, sweating, absolutely desolated human and from the way it puts the spectator inside that human's skin and nerves. Case in point: the superb three-minute sequence when O'Brien, crazed by the doomful diagnosis he's just received, pounds down the steps of a hospital, yowls like a primate, then cuts and runs and keeps running till he blunders against a newspaper kiosk; along the front of this kiosk and in fat bunches on the counter are copies of Life magazine.2. ""Ramrod"" (Andr de-Toth). In essence, the Western is a ballet with three basic choreographies: The Call-out, the Walk-out and the Shoot-out, ""Ramrod,"" which pits an amiable, unscrupulous cattle baron against an amiable, unscrupulous saddletramp, works exquisite combinations and permutations with all three. Watch, above all, what may be the most quietly, ominous and austere gunfight ever filmed: a shot of a man squatting awkwardly by a stream; a shot of Joel McCrea taking small, stiff-legged steps to come up behind him; a shot of the man glimpsing McCrea's reflection in the stream and realizing death is inescapable; a shot of him trying to grin amiably; a shot of McCrea grinning cruelly back.3. ""The Prowler"" (Joseph Losey). Van Heflin is a rogue cop, Evelyn Keyes a prurient, slightly pathetic housewife who makes faces at lawn-loving neighbors. Soon after doing what they like to do, they do what they have to domurder her husband. But if ""The Prowler"" is discount ""Double Indemnity,"" it's also a lot more comfortable with American places and objects, with the kind of sneaky, dangerous eroticism good tabloid melodrama needs. (Even in separate cars parked at a jammed freeway rest-stop Keyes and Heflin forge chains of intimate knowledge.) And the finaleKeyes in a $4-motel box suffering labor pains silently while Heflin moansis as graphic and grueling as a battlefield amputation.4. ""The Gangster"" (Gordon Wiles). Daniel Fuchs adapted his own novel, ""Low Company,"" loading the script with lines that turn soda-jerks into small-time Falstaffs. (""Go wash your teeth and take care of your family."") It's a darkly-shot, bitter, poetic movie about people who measure out their lives with coffee spoons in a Coney Island luncheonette. One of these people is the gangster, Shebunka (Barry Sullivan). He has never used or wanted to use guns; as a result, ruthless outsiders can push him easily, disdainfully out of his little empire of bungalow bordellos. (""Who do you know, Shebunka, and what have you got?"") At the end he has nothing, not even his insistent self-pity; when gunmen wait off-camera to kill him, he holds out his arms and receives their bullets like a benediction. An immense compassion moves beyond clich or campiness. I admire and honor as well the funny, forlorn humanity of Akim Tamiroff crooning to his new ice-cream machine and John Ireland looking and looking at his wife in her rump-sprung bathrobe and saying suddenly and mildly, ""You know, I never had a good day with you.""5. ""He Walked by Night"" (Alfred Werker). Using the drainpipes of Los Angeles, Richard Basehart scuttles under the city to steal electronic gear; the stealing is precise and passionless, the thief as colorless as a glass of water. He has no traits, no idiosyncracies and, though we catch his name once, virtually no identity. We never know or care to know what he does and whom he sees when he's not in the drainpipes, for the real achievement of this movie is in its acute presentation of someone who's managed to make society altogether irrelevant. Forget, therefore, the occasionally intrusive civic-minded narration and concentrate instead on those five minutes of brilliantly visual storytelling as Basehart, wounded, goes, not to a doctor, but to his own roomusing his own surgical instruments and magnifying mirrors to remove the bullet himself.6. ""The Leopard Man"" (Jacques Tourneur). Thirty-four years after its release, this thriller, about a psychopath who terrorizes a Mexican border town, may still be a bit ahead of its time. There's not a cheap trick in it, not an excessive shot or a single piece of cinematic rhetoric. The camera is logical and lucid, linking an image, an idea, to a character's perceptions, pulse rate, wave length. Thus, in a candlelight procession of hooded, keening penitents, it draws you moment by moment deeper into the guilt-ridden mind of the still-unknown killer who walks among them. Various directors over the decades have tried aping this effect without even coming close; none, to my knowledge, has had the skill or nerve to take on the nightwalk: A tipsy seorita-swinger leaves the local hangout, heads home through back streets clicking castanets, wobbling on much-too-high heels. She fears her mother's wrath; the fear is magnified, resonated by sight and sound so that every pebble, bird, cloud partakes of abiding evil. Just as she reaches her door, a branch shakes, bends and, as her mother bolts the door against her, springs up. She screams, and her mother, mockingly, screams louder. At the height of her mother's screams, blood leaks under the door.7. ""Killer McCoy"" (Roy Rowland). The story veers between ludicrous and lamentable. (Street-kid with sweet left hook; father with bottle problem; mobsters with big bet riding against the kid; trainer saying things like, ""Kid, I'm throwing in the towel, the sponge, the stool."") But for once and for the last time, Mickey Rooney gets the chance to use a body as eloquent as Cagney's. You're best off, then, simply feeding on Rooney as he deals his drunken father the most poignant movie-slap ever put on film or parodies a flamenco dancer or relishes a rubdown, a shower, a frankfurter, a kiss. Try, especially, to catch him stroking his girl's hair with 8-ounce boxing gloves and see how long it is before you find yourself forgetting about the gloves.8. ""Gun Crazy"" (Joseph H. Lewis). A carnival marks-person (Peggy Cummins) and a deadeye hick (John Dall) turn Middle America into a pistol range. And while the round-faced apple-cheeked kill-happy kids chase around, we get a looney look at the country entering the fattening fifties. There's no message, really, or if there is one it's delivered by Cummins in a jolting line spoken while she's wandering around a treeless sun-drenched shopping center: ""Hey, it hurts me here! Everything in these forty-eight states hurts me!"" Yet the line is nearly lost under the blasting of horns, the idiot yells from a nearby fun house. Scene after scene abounds in similar tiny, tossed-away triumphs that are never underscored or overworked. Among these triumphs: a pump-jockey deliberately and with utmost delicacy cutting through the fan-belt of an out-of-state Cadillac; an expensively-dressed matron unloading the contents of a supermarket shopping cart, then the shopping cart, into her car; a pair of object-hungry young marrieds fondling pressure cookers in a department store and shivering orgiastically while a hold-up goes on.9. ""Jeopardy"" (John Sturges). For its first 10 or 15 minutes, this one has the look of a low to medium-grade nail-biter. (Barbara Stanwyck and Barry Sullivan make camp between nothing and nowhere; Sullivan is pinned under the pilings of a jetty; and in hours the tide will cover his head.) Director Sturges loves, as a five-year-old cave dweller would and a Hitchcock sometimes does, the banal, beautiful reality of bumper jacks, tow ropes, lug wrenches, crowbars, joists, grapples. He loves, too, exploiting the plain, pure physicality of hard, marred men doing difficult jobs. Ralph Meeker is just such a man, the rescue operation just such a job, and both together wind the movie up like a tight spring; a rough equivalent to the last half hour might be watching the invention of the wheel.10. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (Jack Arnold) ""reduces, by means of special effects that are stamped on the retina, a good-sized, middle-class male into something a little less than the least of earth's creatures. In a way, this might be considered as a merely superb piece of science fiction; in the same way, Kafka's ""Penal Colony"" might be read as a plea for prison reform. I mean that for me, at least, the movie's singularity and strength come from its quiet integrity, its stubborn refusal to rely on gimmickry  though just the battle against the spider or the scaling of the cellar steps or the whiney, peevish voice issuing out of a doll house could have easily carried the highest-priced sci-fi. While I don't know how to overpraise these sequences, I respect even more that quiet closeup of Grant Williams studying his bed, registering thereby an eternity of sexless nights; that icey complaisance of his brother drawling, ""Well, there must be certain . . . domestic problems""; that cheery masochistic mask of his wife's face while she sews and sizes the smallest of coverlets. As for the closing speech, I'll say only that it's worth committing to memory.Just in case I come across as a cranky atavist or, worse, a nostalgia addict, I hasten to recommend ""Murph the Surf"" (Marvin Chomsky), a fairly recent release that seems to me to have something very much like the zest and velocity of my old B's. Though ""Murph"" was generally assigned to second-string critics and allocated two sticks of type at the foot of most movie pages, I'll probably see it five times more for the sake of watching Don Stroud ignore the unbelievable cleavage of a blue-haired Miami Beach matron in favor of the believable seeded onion roll he is ravening.Wallace Markfield is a novelist who writes about popular culture.",1975-08-03T05:00:00+0000

Interest in the housing money market, the major focus of his book, is at a peak. Housing exceeds all other demands for investment funds in the United States because it requires enormous loans to build and finance. Interest charges, as every builder and owner knows, are the largest component of housing cost.

It should be known that Mr. Nozick is a 36year  old philoso phy professor at Harvard, and that he got there by way of Columbia, where he founded the local chapter of the Student League for Industrial Democracy (the socialist organization that in 1962 became Students for a Demcratic Society). It should be known that, surprisingly, his study mounts a major philosophic challenge to any form of paternalistic government that forbids capitalist acts between consenting adults. (In fact, it tries to show that although the protective nightwatchman state conceived by classical liberal philosophy can be evolved from a theoretical state of nature without anyone's natural rights being violated, no more extensive a state than that minimal one can possibly be justified.)

They are made up to look like men made up to look Chinese. Against this crew is ranged Mr. Nimmo's old NannyHelen Hayeswho recognizes him when he is hiding the formula in the neckbone of a dinosaur in the Natural History Museum.Miss Hayes enlists the entire South Kensington nanny squad to help her, and the picture is full of stratagems, chases and battles as nannies and Chinese struggle for the formula and for Mr. Nimmo. At one point the nannies wrest the dinosaur from Mr. Ustinov's men and race it around the countryside in bored steam truck.The plot is neither particularly good nor particularly bad. What makes the picture so bad is the mechanical and unbelieving way in which Mr. Ustinov, Miss Hayes and their troops grind it out. Slapstick whimsey demands real belief by its performers. The swindle this picture inflicts on the children who will go to see it is precisely that of some bored magician at a birthday party who doesn't bother to wear a clean shirt or prevent the cards from showing up his sleeve.There was a time when the name Walt Disney promised much more and fulfilled at least some of the promise.

us,Film: 'The Devil's Rain',"At the start of ""The Devil's Rain,"" which opened yesterday at the Loews State II, Tower East and neighborhood theaters, the titles flash against a Hieronymus Bosch backdrop, and a muffled wailing is heard. ""Let me out,"" voices cry. ""Let me out.""By the time this latest satanism epic ends, it is clear that the wailing is a bit of auditory ectoplasm. It is the accumulated sufferings of the audience at the previous showing that are giving tongue. ""The Devil's Rain"" is ostensibly a horror film, but it barely manages to be a horror.The quality of writing, acting and direction give a general and routine witlessness to this movie about a devil-priest and his congregation of eyeless zombies taking revenge against a family whose forebears did them wrong some 300 years earlier.In addition, though, it has a particular and specialized witlessness that, because it occurs in various other fright pictures around, deserves mention. The film is built uponand collapses fromthe contradiction between two crafts: camera work and special effects.The special gimmick of ""The Devil's Rain,"" its main attempted horror, is the physical transformation of the victim family as its members are captured and turned one by one into zombies. Their eyes are replaced by black holes, their flesh melts and runs at the slightest irritation, and when they are shot, orange and blue glue spurts out.But the photography  its sharp, precise color, meticulous focus, fine grain and zooming close-ups  sabotages the effects. The weave of the black cloth used to blot out the eyes shows up clearly. The stuff leaking from the bodies is foamily chemical. And when the coven is destroyed and the zombies and their master melt away, the interminable lingering of the camera on their dissolving faces only manages to make it evident that we are seeing wax or latex. It is as horrible as watching an egg fry.If we are returning to the catchup school of scary movies, we would be better off with the grainy, black-and white, underlit movies they used to make. That way we could imagine that the catchup was blood and the exposed brain something more than putty. The camera's lint-picking would not undermine things.There isn't much else to say about ""The Devil's Rain."" Evil, as usual in Satan films, wins. Ernest Borgnine, whose mugging seems to have developed a minor camp cultto judge from the authoritative giggling among part of the audienceplays the devil-priest. When his face is whooshed into the features of a satan-ram, you can hardly tell the difference.Keenan Wynn, Eddie Albert and Ida Lupino also appear, with and without eyes. At several of the same neighborhood theaters, a second film, ""Dark Star,"" is beshown. The Bryanston Film people, who are releasing it, had some trouble discovering just where but finally reported that it could be found as far south as 125th Street and as far north as Delancey Street. It will be seen and noted shortly.",1975-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,'Can You Spare a Dime?' Evokes 1930's,"The evils of the present, so the theory goes, are caused by everything that happened in the past. Everythingnot just the obviously bad thingsis guilty. If the grass hadn't been so green, the sun so bright, the daisies so proud, Genghis Khan's grandmother might have said no.Therefore, the green of the grass was really verdigris. The sun caused cancer. The daisies were hairy bullies of the meeker vegetable forms.This may be a wretched view of history, but it allows for some pretty fashionable movie making. For example, it more or less links up the dizzying, sometimes brilliant disarray of film clips that make up ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?,"" a documentary about the nineteen-thirties that opened Wednesday at the Plaza.An old clip shows a pyramid of paper securities collapsing, and the great crash is on. The movie continues, drawing on documentaries. Hollywood pictures, stills and even home movies, to show dozens of disparate things as if they were all part of the same thing. There are malefic capitalists, strike-breaker gangs, a Communist orator, the Dust Bowl. Billie Holiday, Hollywood lushness. Dillinger's corpse, bread lines, Roosevelt and jitterbug contests.The message follows in an epilogue. In quick succession we see Hiroshima, lunar landings, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, each displayed for the booing. Then the collapsing Wall Street pyramid reappears, this time in color.Those jitterbuggers  they look pretty good, in factthose skyscrapers, those beauty queens and rich folks' parties, Roosevelt fishing and the Kennedy boys leaving for Britain at the start of World War II: All are precursors of what the film takes for granted is our present rottenness and imminent collapse.There is nothing wrong with asserting both of these sad things. But the movie doesn't assert. It signals, it uses shorthandis 10 seconds of Nixon really equivalent to two chapters of the Book of Jeremiah?it winks and cross-cuts us into belief. A Rolls-Royce, followed by a shot of a woman who can't afford to buy meat, followed by wild dancing. A Hollywood version of a Ku Klux Klan oath-taking followed by a clip of Buffalo Bill having a group of youngsters recite the Oath of Allegiance.Propaganda films are a game that any number can play. The pity is that the techniques used by Philippe Moraa French-born Australian, now living in Britain, who previously did film compilations on the Nazis' Germany  cheapen and sometimes frustrate his material.And much of the material is magnificent. Furthermore, movies being what they are, it is possible to be moved and illuminated by the good things in ""Brother"" even while wishing that Mr. Mora would go for cofee. It is like touring a first-rate museum with a frequentlynot invariablyinsufferable guide.The best things in ""Brother"" are the materials taken from documentaries, some not previously shown. Set beside theseand Mr. Mora does so frequentlythe portions of Hollywood movies on the same subject seem farcial and unreal.A fictional scene of hoboes riding the rails, good enough in itself, shrivels when followed by an extraordinary newsreel clip of a state trooper telling a group of hoboes with some pity and shame that they will have to turn back.There is a beautiful long sequence showing armed strike-breakers moving into steel pickets, first gently and tentatively, then with growing violence. There is an extraordinary, previously unshown jail interview with Giuseppe Zangara after his attempt to shoot Roosevelt.There is another precious rarity: Billie Holiday, young and in a plain black dress, singing a shivering version of ""Jealousy Blues.""Perhaps the best sustained subject in the movie is the periodic reappearace of Roosevelt. The later Roosevelt, old, distinguished and foxy, is familiar enough, perhaps. To many people the clips showing him as a still youthful, still vigorous campaigner for his first term will be a revelation of just how rousing a man he could be, and why many of our fathers and grandfathers loved him in a way no American President has been loved since.",1975-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Johnson, tackles one of the most critical issues of our time: how to distribute the goods of our system more equally without undermining the efficiency of the system. Trueblue capitalists have no trouble with the problem. Any thing that impairs the efficiency of the system, they say, is wrong economically, socially and morally.

Worse than that, he has brought into American poetry the practice of randomnessa ?? of composition  by  chance familiar to readers of French poets (Mallarm, Valry, Michaux) in whose works the last vestiges of moral instruction and spiritual uplift are crowded out by uncertified sensations and unsanctioned feelings. The factor of chance has already modified certain conceptions in the realm of physics and, in music and painting, has achieved almost the status of a mode.

us,THE HIGH COST OF,"Until the Supreme Court abolished them this June, minimumfee scheduleswhich prohibited lawyers in an area from charging less than a specified feehad a long lineage. The bar of Sedgwick, Kan., adopted one in 1872: Wills brought $10; uncontested divorces, $25, and contested ones, $50. By 1971, 34 states and about 800 local bar associations utilized fee schedules, so that a client could not get an uncontested divorce for less than $600 in New Canaan or dissolve a corporation for less than $350 in Akron. The purpose seemed clear enough: In 1965 the executive director of the Wisconsin state bar reported that obviously and desirably a fee schedule will tend to increase the income of lawyers. A study by economist Richard Arnould confirmed that a lawyer in an area where some form of jurisdictional fee schedule exists makes, on the average, $3,500 more per year than a lawyer in an area where no schedule exists.",1975-08-10T05:00:00+0000

His car is decorated with plastic flowers and a teddy bear whose eyes light up when the brakes are applied. He is a man of damp enthusiasms and uncoordinated passion and probably wears socks in bed.Not surprisingly, his wife, who aspires to elegance, horseback riding and Paris-Match, has left him for the local psychiatrist. Pignon checks into the main hotel of the provincial capital and sets to work to kill himself.The room next to him is occupied by Ralph, a professional assassin who has arrived on the opposite mission. He is to shoot a key witness in a corruption trial that is to take place in the Palace of Justice across the street. The crowded French farce ""A Pain in the A"" (""L'Emmerdeur""), which opened at the 68th Street Playhouse yesterday, tells how the two men's efforts entwine hopelessly and are mutually frustrated.Ralph, played by Lino Ventura, puts out a ""do not disturb"" sign and is assembling his rifle when water floods through the door crack. Pignon (Jacques Brel) has tried to hang himself, managing only to snap off the showerhead.Furiously, Ralph helps the hotel bellhop extricate Pignon. The latter promptly directs the full force of his sticky fervor at the reluctant gangster, thrusting on him the role of spectator and rescuer at each successive suicide attempt. He involves him in a half-hearted campaign to get his wife to feel sorry for him and take him back.Each time Ralph settles down to put his rifle together. Pignon intrudes spectacularly. Finally, in one tussle, Ralph's rifles goes off, the police open fire, and the would-be suicide and assassin are both jailed.""I am very glad to have met you,"" Pignon tells his victim near the end. ""I was very lonely these last three months."" Trotting around the jail yard just ahead of his admirer, the efficient loner Ralph has clearly been given a life sentence of incompetent companionship.Pignon is a character with enough originality and outrageousness to make this, potentially, a funny and biting picture. There are some fine moments. Pignon trots along on foot beside his wife on horseback, trying to win her back. He holds up some, photographs of their new house. ""But they're in color,"" he bleats, as she rides away without looking.But ""A Pain,"" though generally pleasant and often amusing, doesn't quite manage to be itself. One weakness is its French farce convention. It is packed so full of gags and reversesmany of them pretty worn outthat it becomes cloying. The French overeat, figuratively speaking, at their farces.A bigger weakness, though, is that although Mr. Brel is a considerable singer, he is not the marvelous actor that is needed to make the sprawling improbability of Pignon take off. He drags Pignon around manfully but can't get him going on his own. Similarly, though less crucially. Lino Ventura, in a part Jean Gabin might have played, is meager and stolid.",1975-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Now she squeezes and produces an expression of scientific skepticism.""A diplodocus?"" she says. Of course it's a diplodocus. Those were pterodactyls just now, and soon the place will be thick with tyrannosaurs and stegosaurs and other specimens from American International Pictures' carpentry shop.""The Land That Time Forgot,"" a screen adaptation of a story by Edgar Rice Burroughs at neighborhood theaters is an initially agreeable picture about the discovery of a mystery realm where various stages of evolution coexist. Dinosaurs and cavemen. Ancient plant forms and more modern ones.A German U-boat sinks a British transport ship during World War I. A boatload of survivors, including an American submarine expert played by Doug McClure, Miss Penhaligon as a biologist, and several British seamen, manages to seize the submarine when it surfaces and overpowers the crew. Later the crew, led by their gentlemanly Captain Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery), overpowers the overpowerers. Still later they are overpowered back again.Amid all the confusion the U-boat drifts south and finds shelter in an undiscovered Antaractic island left warm by volcanoes. Friends, by now, the submarine's occupants settle down to repair the vessel, fight off dinosaurs and explore the island. Erupting volcanoes and natives eventually destroy them, leaving Mr. McClure and Miss Penhaligon as the only survivors. They are last seen, dressed in yak suits, climbing the snowy north slopes of the island, determined, as Mr. McClure puts it, ""to move forward into the greater mysteries."" Just as the much grander ""Jaws"" became less scary the moment its mechanical shark appeared, the early virtues of ""Land"" collapse once the island is reached and the traffic jam in artificial monsters develops.There had been some good moments in the submarine, chiefly because of the sympathetic performance of Mr. McEnery as the neurotic but courtly captain. Possibly you have wondered how German U-boat commanders managed to sink all those ships when the visors on their caps were so very stiff, making it hard to look through the periscopes. The picture explains: each time the periscope goes up Mr. McEnery twists his cap around to the back. When it goes down he replaces it. There is something engaging about a movie that teaches.""Land"" answers another question, perhaps not conclusively. What does a tyrannosaurus say when he is gored by a triceratops?""Ow!""",1975-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Detective Yarn:Mitchum Is Marlowe in New Version of Chandler's 'Farewell My Lovely',"Around the beginning of the nineteen-forties when Raymond Chandler wrote his thriller ""Farewell My Lovely,"" Leopold Stokowski decided that Bach was too spare for contemporary ears and made a series of lush, big-sound transcriptions with the Philadelphia Orchestra.Lush Bach is long out of fashion, but old movies are still getting the big-sound treatment. A new film version of ""Farewell,"" directed by Dick Richards, opened yesterday at Loew's State I and Tower East. It has been touched up with a little contemporary sex and violence and more than a little contemporary cinematic self-indulgence.It's as if someone had put pillow springs, power-steering and a tape deck into a classic racing-car. It is still handsome and it still goes, but it is a handsome mediocrity.Mr. Richards has been less ambitious than Robert Altman, who two years ago translated another Chandler work, ""The Long Goodbye,"" into personages and a setting totally of the seventies. ""Farewell"" is kept back in the forties; it is just that certain present-day movie mannerisms have been talked on. When Marlowe, the detectiveplayed by Robert Mitchumerupts into a brothel, the whores earn the picture its R rating by appearing naked. In the picture's most repugnant scene Mr. Mitchum is allowed to deal the fat old womanadmittedly, a villainessa crunching and bloody blow in the face.The camera can linger endlessly on yellow and brown interiors, on neon lights, on the technicolored dilapidation of back-alley Los Angeles. It is a movie interlarded with photography; about 15 excess minutes' worth.Chandler plots can be confusing in the movies: people still argue about just what happened at the end of Howard Hawks's version of ""The Big Sleep."" ""Farewell"" deals with the efforts of Marlowe to track down a mysterious Velda, the lost love of a great, hulking ex-con who wants her back even though she hasn't written him all the years he was in jail.Marlowe's search, which cuts across a swath of metropolitan corruption, is attended by elusive clues, red herringsblood-red, usuallyand a great many corpses. So much is unresolved along the way that the few violent minutes of elucidation at the end produce some confusion. If you are a critic you can refer to a synopsis. If you are a member of the audience you may have to read the book, or perhaps pay to sit through another showing.The strengths of this movie are in Mr. Chandler and in the high quality of a lot of the acting. The author's lines, tough, funny and baroque, get full value. As in a 1945 version of the same book, with Dick Powell, there are substantial sections in which the narrator simply reads Mr. Chandlerin this case, with the camera wandering as he does it.There are lines that stand out. When the ex-con, a virtual giant played with brutality and vulnerable charm by Jack O'Halloran, is asked what Velda is like, he replies:""Cute. Cute as lace pants."" His lips and neck quiver with the effort and triumph of finding a verbal equivalent for the delicate memory that torments his great bulk.As a drunken widow, Silvia Miles plays a role that seems an overdone clich until you realize that she is doing it with such subtlety that her lost beauty keeps flickering back. John Ireland, another fine and subtle actor, improves on his stock part as a cynical, tired and honest detective.Robert Mitchum always takes getting to know in a role. He comes on too strongly at first: too stagey, too droopy an eye, an excessively dangling cigarette. But he settles into his part, his performance drops away and he moves through the picture with force, humor and unexpected humility. Inevitably you think of Bogart: he isn't Bogart but he is very good.With Charlotte Rampling, long-haired and slinky, you think of Lauren Bacall: the imitation is both painfully intentional and painfully bad. Presumably the director noticed it; probably he ordered it. He should have stopped it. Miss Rampling has had some bad roles but she is beautiful and expressive and should have been allowed a more congenial way to play her part.",1975-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'McGonagall,' Son of 'Goon Show'","The brand of humor devised 20 years ago by Britain's ""Goon Show""Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombeand revived more recently by ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" has a shadowed, hallucinatory quality to it. Its wild associations are the kind that come as we drop off to sleep and just before we wake up.It is particularly suited to the passive, divided attention with which we watch television. The non sequiturs, the outrageous inventions take form just outside the field of vision, loom up suddenly and just as suddenly switch to something else. Things blur; their sequence is obscure: The result is hilarity under ether.It is hard to transpose this kind of thing to a movie. People have come to see it; they have paid admission; their attention is more sharply focused; the screen image is big, clear and detailed. A two-headed bearded lady can't lope by quietly in the background: she requires to be explained somehow.If ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" worked, it is because the whirling lights were strung along a plot, rudimentary as it may have been.Years after the Goons broke up, Mr. Milligan and their director, Joseph McGrathboth collaborated on the screenplayhave tried to put together a full-length Goon-style picture.""The Great McGonagall,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Village, is endearing, and parts of it are lovely and hilarious. But it lacks enough of an organizing principle in its chaos to succeed as a movie.It centers on the true figure of William McGonagall, an unemployed 19th-century Scottish weaver who imagined himself so passionately to be a poet that he in fact wrote verse and got it published. For instance, an ode to a cow:The Hen it is a noble beastThe Cow is more forlorner Standing in the rainWith a leg at every corner.In no way can the plot be summarized. Things happen, one after the other: some belong to McGonagall himself, some to his dreams, some to his dying hallucinations. We struggle too hard  we shouldn't, perhaps, but we doto disentangle dream from dream and reality from reality.Mr. Milligan is the bearded, gentle McGonagall who prefaces every recitation of his verse with an inarticulate howl that allows everyone time to flee.He sees, or imagines he sees, Queen Victoria at a theater variety show. He is invited, or imagines he is invited, to go to Balmoral Castle to read his poems. He goes, or imagines he does, and is turned away, or imagines he is.The pace is frenetic, the level of reality shifts every two minutes, it is stuffed with visual absurdities, old jokes and take-offs. Some work, some exasperate. McGonagall dances with Queen Victoriaa monotonous, one-joke role played patiently by Peter Sellersto an orchestra composed of Adolf Hitlers. He and Victoria and Prince Albert pump away at a steam calliope that projects dirty slides to the tune of ""Amazing Grace.""McGonagall does Macbeth on stage, wearing a Band-Aid on his nose. With the vegetables hurled at him he gives a cast party. He locks the doors so the guests can't escape when he recites his poetry.Finally, he lies on his death bed. The poet Tennyson and a man named King Theebaw of the Andaman Islands walk in carrying a decoration from the Queen. They strip to their Victorian underwear and climb decorously into bed with him while his wife serves cookies and tea.McGonagall dies, and you are sorry. Despite his madness, his delusions, his bad poems, you miss him. He is a radiant failure. So, in a way, is his movie, with all bad jokes, carelessness and confusion.",1975-08-16T05:00:00+0000

From that day his traps are full and his longing for companionship is fulfilled by the mystifying appearance of a hauntingly tender silent woman. She is the winter wife. The chill of the frosty woods thaws in the warmth of the hunter's new happiness. But the days pass and the hunter returns in the spring to the village of his father. For the first time the winter wife speaks to warn him against marrying another. The hunter goes to the village without her, and through the summer months he yearns for her. With the first snow, he returns to the silent wife, and now there is a child. Several years pass in similar fashion. The hunter becomes wealthy but each summer he must go back to the village where pressures build to marry the chief's daughter.

us,A Summer Picnic: Fine Wine and Superb Food Came to the Rescue,"THE SPRINGS, L.I.Dear Diary: Well, it's the end of summer, and I guess the thing I remember most about it was Claudia's wedding. That's Claudia Franey, Pierre's daughter. She married a nice young man named Rick Jensen, and there was a big striped tent and 170 guests and a 4foot wedding cake that was made by Albert Kumin, one of the world's great pastry chefs. There were also six great chefs in the kitchenJacques Pepin, Jean Vergnes, Raymond Bruballa, JeanJacques Paimblanc, JeanLouis Todeschini, plus the father of the bride. Roger Fessaguet, chef of La Caravalle, was tied up in traffic, but he got there in time for the wedding march. The chefs spent a couple of daysand a couple of nights, for that matterpreparing the food, a cold buffet with lots of aspic dishes and a hot buffet that included 10 fillets of beef with truffle sauce, 15 roasted racks of lamb and a chicken and veal Burgundy tart. The cold buffet, indecently delicious, included cold striped bass with salad russe, mussels vinaigrette, terrines of sweetbreads, pt of venison, galantines of duck, a salad of pork rind pt (would you believe it is one of the greatest pt ever devised?), and garlic sausages with lentils. A most amusing thing happened the next day. We looked in the refrigerator and found enough leftover venison pate and sweetbread terrine to feed a stnall crowd, so we called up some of our favorite picnic people (we've observed that there are some people who simply aren't picnic types) to come over for a feast and lots of them came with pinic food and wine. The weather looked threatening and the tent was still intact, so we decided to stage the picnic there. The guests included Josephine Premice and Jane White, the actresses, and Alfredo Viazzi, the owner of the Trattoria de Alfredo and the Tavola Calda da Alfredo in Greenwich Village. There was Sam Aaron, the wine and spirits man (he owns SherryLehman), plus his wife, Florence, and Sarah Lewis, a grand cook and neighbor. Josephine made a seductive smoked herring vinaigrette, a Haitian dish; Florence brought a delectable cold salad of hardcooked eggs with salmon, and Sarah showed up with her famous cold steamer clams with mustard mayonnaise appetizer plus her notable black beans vinaigrette and a fine chicken dish Mexicanstyle, which she had learned from the late Paula Peck. We rounded out the menu with tomatoes and anchovies vinaigrette. There seemed to be an awful lot of viniagrette dishes, but then it was catch as catch can. Sam brought the picnic wines, a California white, Del Mar Ranch, Monterrey Vineyard, 1974; and a French Chateau de la Chaize, 1973. It wasn't the weather that threatened the day's bliss so much as the tent movingmen who loomed exceedingly large in the driveway. There is more than one way, we learned, to stall a tentmover's mission. With a dispatch that would have heartened Amphytrion, some glasses of wine were thrust into the movingmen's hands, and they were invited to dine and a couple of hours later we were still being urged not to rush.",1975-08-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Exciting 'White Line Fever',"The plot is inflated, the violence is inflatedthough well-shotthere is a lot of blacktop highway and a great many roaring vehicles that swerve, crash and burn.But ""White Line Fever,"" a movie about truckers and racketeers, stands far above its own clichs. It has genuine excitement and a frequent beauty of style. It makes an occasional effort to treat a subject virtually unheard of in the movies nowadays, despite the recession; the pressure and bone-weariness of trying to earn a living. Finally, though the plot is often cardboard, it is inhabited by some real people who manage the ordinary human accomplishmentand the much rarer movie accomplishment  of intimacy.""White Line Fever,"" which opened Tuesday at the Columbia I and other theaters in the metropolitan area, is about a young man who gets out of the Air Force, marries his sweetheart and goes into hock to buy a trailer rig. He wants to be a trucker, like his father: He finds that the business is dominated by a network of crooked businessmen, politicians and thugs.Refusing to join in by accepting contraband cigarettes as part of his cargo he is beaten up and blacklisted. He organizes a truckers' rebellion: He is shot at, beaten some more, framed on a murder charge, has a rattle-snake planted in his truck and is nearly burned to death with his pregnant wife.He and his supporters manage to get rid of some of the crooks, and finally they organize a statewide truckers strike. It seems to be a victory, of sorts, but there are glimpses of higher-ups and still-higher-ups who seem to be doing as well as ever at the end. It is a life-like inconclusiveness.The pace is fast, and the camera conveys beautifully the movement and danger in the big rigs. In a night scene, for example, the hurtling road is photographed from the cab at a steeper and steeper angle, giving the feeling that the blackness ahead is a wall.The rarity in an action picture of this kind is the quiet and sensitive acting of the two principals: Jan-Michael Vincent as the rebellious driver and Kay Lenz as his wife.

A few kilometers down the road is a small town with a large war memorial, an obelisk with four artillery shells planted at its corners. On the stone scroll are inscribed the words To Our Glorious Dead, 19141918, elegantly laid out to fill the space; but the dates 1939 and 1945, in numerals necessarily smaller, have been squeezed into the bottom corners of the scroll. Nobody, when this elaborate cenotaph was designed, imagined that it might be necessary to commemorate the dead of a further great war; and when the time came nobody seems to have felt like building another. The monument may accordingly be seen, in one sense, as illustrating a belief which Paul Fussell shares with the late Winston Churchill, namely, that there was really only one war, the Thirty Years War of 191445; in another sense, it is an emblematic demonstration of another of Fussell's doctrines, which is that the earlier war predominates over the later in the modern memory and the modem imagination.",1975-08-31T05:00:00+0000

The struggle with privacy and paralysis, which is at the center of some very interesting recent fiction, is obviously quite alien to the work of Joyce Carol Oates. But she is not as naive about matters of form and questions of narrative as some people contend; her productivity is simply a matter of her having solved these problems at least to her own satisfaction.

Then, if the visiting team scores three runs in the first inning and the visiting pitcher hurls a perfect game (with no one reaching base), he has done it. If his team scores four runs in the top of the first, he must allow no more than one man on base at a time (and pitch a shutout) to do it. Otherwise his team has to score five or more runs its first turn at bat... The Mets got six, two of which Matlack knocked in himself.
