''Who are you voting for?'' he would ask. If he heard the name Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. Badillo's rival, he would cover his face in mock horror. ''Were you born and raised here?'' he asked Florence Frost, 64. ''Well, Mr. Bloomberg couldn't find Bay Ridge on the map if his life depended on it.'' In fact, Mr. Bloomberg has been to Bay Ridge on several occasions, including a town meeting last week, his spokesman, Ed Skyler said yesterday. But Ms. Frost, who had been planning to vote for Mr. Bloomberg, didn't know that, and changed her mind. Mirta Ojito (NYT)",2001-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Danny Almonte, it turns out, has not attended school since he came to this country 18 months ago. He may not have consistently attended school in the Dominican Republic, where he was born, and he and his father may be in the United States illegally.

Hevesi said initially that he thought the United States should attend, but latersaid he had misspoken because he did not know about the conference. Fernando Ferrer offered a murky response: ''The decision by Secretary of State Powell said the Bush administration, in fact, has been asleep at the switch, for example, on the Commission on Human Rights at the U.N., letting slave-trading nations like Sudan be in the driver's seat.'' What that meant, a spokesman said later, was that the administration should send someone to the conference -- and then denounce the policy. Peter F. Vallone promised that he would do whatever he could ''to understand how serious the problem of racism is.''

The idea of providing federal subsidies for the charitable activities of religious groups was greeted enthusiastically when the White House first unveiled the plan. But now this seriously flawed legislation is in trouble. It lost support in July when it was rammed through the House in a manner that seemed offensively partisan. More recently, John DiIulio, the White House's chief adviser on the initiative, made a much-noted departure. Mr. DiIulio, a Democrat and an academic, said he wanted to spend more time with his family. But his sudden exit at this critical moment was a blow, since he gave the original proposal much of its credibility and bipartisan sheen. Ironically, it now falls to Mr. DiIulio's friend Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut to either rid the bill of its most dangerous provisions or shelve it.",2001-09-01T05:00:00+0000

The British-born designer and author who moved here in 1929 became both a champion of contemporary American design and one of its sharpest critics. In two books -- Goodbye, Mr. Chippendale'' (1944) and ''Homes of the Brave'' (1954) -- Gibby, as he was known, skewered America's design pretensions from our obsession with antiques to Bauhaus modern, which left him cold. For clients like Doris Duke, he designed comfortable interiors with clean lines. But his love of modernity was always rooted in the past -- specifically in the Greek furniture that he first saw on some ancient pottery and reproduced in chairs and tables that are still in production. To Robsjohn-Gibbings, who died in 1976, the proliferation of oh-so-low furniture would be yesterday's news. He lampooned it 47 years ago in this excerpt from ''Homes of the Brave.''

us,Grand Illusions,"Trompe l'oeil painting on a small scale may serve as mere decorative detail for interiors, but when it's done on a monumental scale and united with exterior architecture, a reinterpretation of the urban landscape emerges. For the past 25 years, Richard Haas has used trompe l'oeil, the art of illusionary painting, as a means of commenting on architecture and urban history in cities across the country. In THE CITY IS MY CANVAS (Prestel, $39.95), Haas presents his architectural murals, including before-and-after photographs of the spaces he has transformed. Haas's interest in murals grew from his making drypoint etchings of architecture and small diorama boxes of street scenes of his SoHo neighborhood. His use of trompe l'oeil to recreate the facades or even the shadows of long-gone buildings remind the viewer of both present and past, thus inviting contemplation of urban change. ''It was my hope,'' Haas writes, ''that, once thus engaged, the viewer might seek other layers of meaning and be able to read the larger story told by the artwork.'' It is this illusion that captures us, and when the trick is revealed, Haas has already compelled us to see our cities in a different way. M. Cameron Arnold",2001-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Once a French military base, Ghardimao was now the headquarters of the Algerian Arm&#233;e de Lib&#233;ration Nationale (ALN) (National Liberation Army) and the situation there was tense. Two photographs decorated the otherwise bleak walls of the political commissariat. They were of Fidel Castro and Frantz Fanon. In the last week of June, Paris-Presse &#146;s Jean-Fran&#231;ois Khan also travelled to Ghardimao to report on the situation there. He too saw a photograph on the wall. It was of Frantz Fanon, &#145;the pamphleteer from Martinique&#146;. Algeria&#146;s long war of independence was virtually at an end; the Evian agreements had been signed by the French government and the Gouvernement Provisoire de la R&#233;publique Alg&#233;rienne (GPRA) (Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic) on 18 March and a ceasefire had come into effect the following day. Relations between Algeria&#146;s &#145;forces of the interior&#146; and the &#145;frontier army&#146; penned behind the Morice Line of electrified wire entanglements, floodlights and minefields, had long been strained and were now almost at breaking point. Tensions between the GPRA, headed by Ahmed Ben Bella, and Colonel Houari Boum&#233;dienn&#233;&#146;s ALN were also dangerously high. Khan was convinced that a coup led by Boum&#233;dienne was in the offing. He was both right and wrong; Boum&#233;dienne&#146;s Arm&#233;e Nationale Populaire entered Algiers in triumph on 9 September 1962, but the coup against Ben Bella did not occur until 1965.

us,"QUICK BITE/Whitesboro; Where Flip Wilson Lived, Chicken and Ribs","Whitesboro is a place that most often gets quickly passed by vacationers heading down to Wildwood and Cape May on Route 9. It is a small, primarily African-American town founded at the end of the 19th century by George White, one of the few black congressmen of his era. The trailer that houses the Whitesboro Historical Museum has a fine display about Mr. White, along with others about two more famous Whitesboro natives: Steadman Graham, the motivational speaker who is Oprah Winfrey's longtime beau; and Flip Wilson, the late comedian. Just down the street from the Museum is Wilson's boyhood home, which has been transformed in the last year into Tiffany's Southern Style, the best soul food joint around. While eating at the shore can be an enervating experience of high prices, long waits and small portions, you will find none of that at Tiffany's. Chopped barbecue is a mountainous portion of shredded meat with tangy-sweet dark sauce clinging to it. Fried chicken is lightly fried as is the pork chop sandwich. Lunch sandwiches run between $3 for a burger to $5.75 for a sparerib sandwich. Dinners -- $10.75 and $8.75 for everything else -- come with two mountainous portions of sides like cheddar macaroni and cheese, black-eye peas, dirty rice or mashed sweet potatoes. Desserts -- sweet potato pie, peach cobbler, pecan pie -- are homemade and go for $2.50 to $2.75. There is a six-person counter and a few booths, but a lot of folks sneak Tiffany's food back onto the expensive barrier islands. Robert Strauss",2001-09-02T05:00:00+0000

To be sure, fitting in hasn't seemed to be a major concern for Ms. Hilton, 17, who, with her older sister, Paris, has become a dewy old standard on the party circuit and in gossip columns. Still, while Ms. Hilton's rather too-fabulous lifestyle has received a torrent of finger-wagging press, her clothing style is, well, shockingly reasonable. ''I like casual,'' Ms. Hilton said. ''Jeans and white tanks, comfortable turtlenecks in the winter. Oh, and I'm constantly wearing a hooded sweatshirt under a jean jacket.'' Stocking her closet with moderately priced designers like Daryl K, Noir and Marc by Marc Jacobs, Ms. Hilton likes to ''wear summer as long as possible,'' keeping her beachy tops and Prada platform sandals in use well after Labor Day. For classes, she favors easy pieces like a Marc Jacobs graffiti sweatshirt ($98 at Language), Helmut Lang jeans ($170 at Helmut Lang), New Balance sneakers and last spring's Louis Vuitton Speedy bag. Her current obsessions are a monogrammed tank top by Cabana 16 ($68 at Olive & Bette's), Miss Sixty jeans ($139 at NYSE in Los Angeles) and the Noir Patch bag ($110 at Henri Bendel).

The 80's retro-dazzle look, which long predates the gear's young owners, includes ''crystallized'' combination locks and calculators, as well as custom airbrushed jean jackets, binders and backpacks ($50 to $150). This brand of name-calling appeals to kids of all ages: Madonna's daughter, Lourdes, chose a crystal belt buckle bearing her nickname, Lola, while Britney Spears had a picture of her Yorkie airbrushed on a bag. For parents wary of letting children wear their names on the street, Noir owner Leeora Catalan suggests using the name of a favorite pop star, pet or sports figure.

At the time, wrestling was changing its focus, from the fake grappling in the ring to an intricate web of ''story lines'' that writers were fabricating around it, often filmed as behind-the-scenes revelations. These added a second or third layer of unreality commenting on the first. It was addicting and, in its play on the borders between truths and untruths, quite revealing.

She never lost sight of her goal-to continue to live her life to the fullest potential despite the obstacles that were put in her path. Linda was a true friend and confidant to all whom she encountered. She never missed a birthday, special event, or her Thursday night Mahjong game. Linda always had a smile, was the first to offer assistance, and made all her friends and family members feel as though they were truly special. Linda's knack for entertaining, combined with her sincere thoughtfulness, always left people feeling good about themselves and grateful to have her in their lives. Linda was a dedicated member of Temple Sholom in River Edge, New Jersey where she served on many committees over the past twenty-five years. Her sincere and direct approach to life offered those around her the opportunity to learn from her. Linda's great wit, sense of style, pragmatic approach to the daily conflicts of life, ready smile, thoughtful note, and most importantly, her courage to face strife head-on without looking back is how she will be remembered.

us,Teacher Exodus Documented," The United Federation of Teachers has come up with a new estimate of how many New York City teachers leave for the suburbs, suggesting that nearly 1,300 left for other districts in New York State last year. A separate survey by the schools chancellor, HAROLD O. LEVY, found that about 1,100 teachers leave for the suburbs each year and SOL STERN, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has studied such departures, came up with a much smaller figure, closer to 150. The union's figure was based on a comparison of the Social Security numbers of teachers who left in 2000 with the numbers of all current members of the state teachers' union, which represents teachers in most of the state's other school districts. It found 1,282 matches, most of them in the nearby suburbs. Using the same method, the union determined that 991 teachers left for other New York State districts in 1999, and 777 did so in 1998.

It was a mock man-overboard exercise, showing 13 students how a person who falls into the sea is rescued. Grinning in delight, Shaquan called out, ''We're doing this all night, right?'' The answer was yes. Last Friday, the Police Athletic League brought Shaquan and 12 other students from Washington Heights and the Bronx aboard the ships Pioneer and Wavertree for an overnight stay. The sleepover is part of the South Street Seaport Museum's Penny Project, which provides programs for children helped by social service agencies throughout New York City. After a sail in New York Harbor on the schooner Pioneer, during which the students raised sails and read nautical maps, they boarded the Wavertree, a 325-footer cargo vessel built in 1885. They cooked dinner, kept a ship's log and slept in sailor bunks. CHARLIE RITCHIE, a chaperon from the Police Athletic League, said such programs gave children from the city an opportunity for ''constructive risk taking, and more positive adventure'' than what they often saw on the street.

Patrick Puy, the chief executive, said Moulinex was forced to seek the French equivalent of Chapter 11 after El.Fi S.p.A., the Italian group that holds 74 percent of Moulinex shares, refused pay for the reorganization.

It was June 16, 1919, graduation day for the 3d Officers' Training Camp (OTC). After five months of strenuous effort, each man had earned a commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve. The post band opened the ceremonies with a medley of martial tunes capped by John Philip Sousa's march ""Semper Fidelis."" The music turned out to be the most stirring portion of the program, which otherwise consisted of short speeches and the presentation of commissions. A reporter noted that the ""striking feature of the proceedings"" was their solemnity and simplicity in comparison with graduations at West Point and Annapolis. Although the writer ascribed this difference to ""that precision and lack of fuss so characteristic of the doings of Marines,"" in truth there was little to celebrate at the moment. Seven months earlier there had been rejoicing when an armistice ended the ""war to end all wars."" Now the United States was rapidly demobilizing its forces. The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Major General George Barnett, pointedly noted in his speech that this placed the class ""in a peculiar position."" This commissioning ceremony would not launch the lieutenants on a grand and glorious new career; rather, for most of them it marked the end of their service as Marines. ",2001-09-09T05:00:00+0000

The ultimate repository for the history of the language is greatly indebted to Americans for much of what makes the Oxford English Dictionary what it is: the citations, or the quotations of language that illustrate the use of every sense of every word in the O.E.D. ''Every quotation,'' wrote Dr. Johnson in the preface to his great Dictionary of the English Language, ''contributes something to the stability or enlargement of the language,'' and so for the O.E.D. finding good citations is its primary goal.",2001-09-09T05:00:00+0000

Nakagaki had placed the mold in a small maze comprising four possible routes and planted pieces of food at two of the exits. Despite its being an incredibly primitive organism (a close relative of ordinary fungi) with no centralized brain whatsoever, the slime mold managed to plot the most efficient route to the food, stretching its body through the maze so that it connected directly to the two food sources. Without any apparent cognitive resources, the slime mold had ""solved"" the maze puzzle. ",2001-09-09T05:00:00+0000

In the three years Bobby Sliwowski has been operating Bobby Chez in South Jersey, the combination of take-out convenience and crab cakes has built a clientele that includes the famous and the harried. David Copperfield and Molly Ringwald have pulled up to the Margate store in a limo, and Billy Joel and Calvin Klein have had them shipped. Mr. Sliwowski closed his Chez Robert restaurant (most recently in Westmont) three years ago because of financial troubles, then opened Bobby Chez in Voorhees, one in Cherry Hill a year later and, this summer, a third in Margate. The menu in each includes fried and coconut shrimp ($3.50 each), grilled fish and fried scallops ($8 a half-pound), along with side dishes like lobster mashed potatoes ($5 or $10), coleslaw ($3 or $6) and roasted red peppers in basil and garlic ($3). The crab cakes, the size of tennis balls, are $5.95 apiece. At home, the cakes go into a 450-oven and bake for 12 minutes. Mr. Sliwowski sells 20,000 a week, including to restaurants. The limo-less have been known to stand in line for up to 90 minutes to buy them, particularly at holidays.

When I was 16 I owned a Chevrolet Corvair convertible, which was a lovely car, except that it was universally known to be unsafe at any speed. My next try, some years later, was a Fiat, which was wonderful when it ran. I sold it knowing it needed a ring job. The purchaser declined my urging that he take it for an inspection because he knew all about Fiats and he was sure this one would be fine. I was thus not terribly remorseful when he told me a week after he bought it that it needed a new transmission. I got my father's car after he died intestate. It was a two-door Datsun. When it arrived, it was full of the evidence of my father's life -- every possible gadget that could be plugged into the lighter socket, lots of tools, a pair of sunglasses. Deep under the passenger's seat was a single plastic flip-flop in a large size, obviously my father's sandal. At his death, I hadn't seen or spoken to my father in 28 years. His flip-flop gave me a turn. I traded the Datsun in for a Chevy Cavalier wagon, because it was very hard to get the baby seat into the back seat of the Datsun. I lost the Chevy in a divorce, which was fine with me because various parts of the electrical system had caught fire over the years. A year after the divorce, the Chevy was stolen and driven into a water-filled quarry. After it was lifted by crane from its watery submersion, the Police Department representative who was supervising the operation said, ''Wait a minute!'' A few minutes later, they pulled out another Chevy Cavalier wagon, same year, same model.",2001-09-09T05:00:00+0000

She had waist-length blond hair, boyfriends, an abundance of purple garments, important moods -- and political beliefs that sometimes prevented her from going to school. (During the Vietnam War, she once persuaded my mother to write a note to her high-school principal that read: ''Please excuse Cindy's absence yesterday. She was sick -- sick of war.'') As we got older, the age gap between us seemed to narrow, and we grew steadily closer. But in the meantime, Cindy had become a doctor, adding a layer of professional expertise to her big-sisterly mystique, and I had become, among other things, a hypochondriac and a mother. Cindy is an uncannily good diagnostician, quick to piece together scattered clues and reveal truths about underlying ailments in a way that strikes me as magical, though I suppose it has as much to do with how attentively she listens as with any actual occult powers.",2001-09-09T05:00:00+0000

It's only a short step from there to ''Iron Child,'' a story in which a hungry waif meets a strange rust-covered boy who teaches him to survive lean times by eating iron. Mo Yan's blunt portrayal of the suffering in recent Chinese history has occasionally rankled his government. And these stories do indeed brim with the vagaries of life under Communist rule: mandatory attendance at executions in ''The Cure,'' the bitter inequities of the Cultural Revolution in ''Love Story,'' callous treatment of unwanted infant girls in ''Abandoned Child.'' But beneath his unsentimental depiction of peasants and workers lies a deep affection for the downtrodden. In the masterly title story, a laid-off factory worker prospers by converting an abandoned bus in the woods into a cozy love shack and renting it out for quick trysts; like this resourceful soul, Mo Yan transforms the wreckage of everyday life into something useful, cheering and rare.

Outside his window a long, humid summer, the first hot season of the third millennium, baked and perspired. The city boiled with money. Rents and property values had never been higher, and in the garment industry it was widely held that fashion had never been so fashionable. New restaurants opened every hour. Stores, dealerships, galleries struggled to satisfy the skyrocketing demand for ever more recherch produce: limited-edition olive oils, three-hundred-dollar corkscrews, customized Humvees, the latest anti-virus software, escort services featuring contortionists and twins, video installations, outsider art, featherlight shawls made from the chin-fluff of extinct mountain goats. So many people were doing up their apartments that supplies of high-grade fixtures and fittings were at a premium. There were waiting lists for baths, doorknobs, imported hardwoods, antiqued fireplaces, bidets, marble slabs.

Sarah Lehane was overseeing evening chow in the mess hall at Souza-Baranowski, a large Massachusetts maximum-security prison for men, when an inmate hit another officer in the face with a tray. Fights in a prison mess hall are like sparks in a powder keg: officers know they can lead to full-scale riots unless they are quickly contained. As officers (there were 10 in the room and a few more just outside) rushed to subdue the inmate and inmates (there were more than 200 in the mess hall) rushed to his defense, Lehane, standing across from the gates that computers had begun to close automatically, chose not freedom but the fight -- she ran to the defense of a young officer who was down and getting kicked. After three minutes, the melee was over, and Lehane extricated herself from what she describes as ''a pig pile.'' Nine officers had been injured, including her (a twisted knee and a banged-up shoulder); the one most badly hurt is still out with a fractured skull and swelling of the brain. Though the knee quickly healed, Lehane now admits that the incident rattled her. As it did her husband, Capt. Tom Lehane, who happened to be watching the mess hall on a video monitor as the incident took place. ''That was about as ugly a jump-off as I've ever seen,'' he says.

us,A Desktop-Quality Screen Takes Its Act on the Road,"When computer buyers hear the name Sharp, they probably think of flat-screen monitors for desktops or maybe a microwave oven for the office kitchen. Lately, however, the company has made a big push into the notebook computer market on the strength of its reputation as a screen maker. Last week Sharp unveiled its newest entry, the PC-UM10, which comes with a Pentium III 600 megahertz processor, 128 megabytes of RAM, a 20-gigabyte hard drive and Sharp's anti-glare technology for its 12.1-inch monitor. What makes the PC-UM10 stand out, however, is its relative size. At under three pounds and less than three-quarters of an inch thick (excluding its diskette and CD-ROM drives), the notebook, which starts at $1,999, is as light and slender as many of the slightest notebooks. It could be the perfect companion for road warriors whose obsession with dropping weight rivals that of hot-air balloonists. Bruce Headlam",2001-09-13T05:00:00+0000

To send your own comments, send e-mail to shareyourthoughts@nytimes.com . I woke up on the morning of September 12th to the 6 o'clock news, and the horror of what had happened in America. I could not believe it, I prayed it was not true. I logged on to the internet at 6.15 am and I felt sick to my stomach to see the picture of the destruction of the WTC. I spent the rest of the day in shock - all I could think of were the poor victims and their loved ones. Many Australians felt the same shock and horror - I listened to people who rang in to radio stations and I shed tears along with them. Even though we are many miles away, we feel your pain and suffering. I cannot bear to think of the grief of the relatives still searching for their loved ones. Since that morning when I heard the news, I have not stopped thinking about this carnage. It is not just Americans that have been affected - hundreds of people of other nationalities were involved. It was a day that the world changed for me. In my lifetime, I had not experienced an event like this that has caused such horror and fear worldwide. What are we to do now? Do we let the perpetrators go unpunished because it will cost more lives to go to war? Yes, we want peace but are people so naive as to think that these terrorists are content with this one act of destruction? Do you really think they will not attempt greater acts of terrorism ? I am a Christian and I do not believe in vengeance,but I don't want to live my life in fear, always looking over my shoulder, wondering when the next evil act will occur. And this is how everyone has been affected by this tragedy. The toll goes well beyond the 5000 who may have been killed. There were thousands injured, and there are tens of thousands of family and friends whose lives will never be the same again. Then there are people like us around the world who did not directly know the victims, but who feel the grief and the fear of potential war and conflict. And what about the financial impact? Businesses have been destroyed and many will continue to slide. Jobs will be lost and the effects will ripple. One evil act has done this. No one will feel safe again until these terrorists are hunted down. Yes, America should retaliate and the world should stand with you. Do this, for the sake of our children and their children.

A spokeswoman for the commission, Jonna VanDyk, attributed the drop in citations to successful public education programs for drivers and bartenders, such as the .08 signs that began showing up on state roads in 1998.

Twilight shadows cause these scattering figures to blur as they assemble around a trampoline. A 9-year-old girl named Katie Mahar clambers onto the taut fabric; dimly illuminated by crisscrossing shadows, she rises and falls in the air, looking like an antic ghost. She wears a T-shirt with a curious inscription: ''I'm an X.P. star! We've got the sun on the run!'' All around Katie, beams of flashlights swivel and cross.

us,"Wouldn't Want to Live There, Though","The British painter Francis Bacon (1909-92) is best known for expressionistic triptychs and portraits of himself, screaming popes, absent friends and vanished lovers. In 7 REECE MEWS: Francis Bacon's Studio (Thames and Hudson, $24.95),+a series of photographs of the studio where Bacon lived and worked for the last 30 years of his life, Perry Ogden has produced what feels like a landscape of Bacon's interior -- a catalog of the modern artist's psyche. Crumpled photographs and letters splashed in paint flood the room. Frayed boxes long since emptied of bottles of port and Champagne disgorge newspapers and pages ripped from magazines onto the floor. Hundreds of dirty paintbrushes, dried in their butter bean and orange juice cans, perch next to books on Seurat and Velzquez. The corduroy rags Bacon sometimes used to paint textures drape on top of paint-encrusted trays. Books on skin disorders and forensics sprawl across the floor. A bare bulb hangs next to its nooselike toggle string, an image familiar from several Bacon portraits. Canvases stacked in one corner reveal only their white or splattered backs; several slashed canvases lie scattered with the other detritus on the floor. The slightly sinister aura seems appropriate, given that Bacon's estate has been involved in lawsuits charging art world skulduggery, and leads one to wonder if Bacon really did leave his studio just like this. Is there any way to know? John Edwards, Bacon's sole heir, says in the book's foreword that the studio was left untouched from Bacon's death until 1998, when it was removed to Dublin, Bacon's birthplace. Turn the page and any doubts evaporate: Bacon the artist re-emerges in the light, color and composition of the unfinished work left on the easel at his death. In Ogden's photos, one almost smells the sulfuric remnants of Bacon's imagination. Elissa Meyers",2001-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Now he was standing in the hotbed of secession and all was quiet as could be.

us,Small but Numerous,"This phenomenon is known to every pregnant woman: when you are pregnant, the world is suddenly, mysteriously full of other pregnant women. Susan Meyers (author of the middle grade ''P. J. Clover, Private Eye'' series) experienced an almost identical effect with the birth of her first grandchild: she noticed babies everywhere. Her heightened awareness soon led her to write EVERYWHERE BABIES (Harcourt, $16; ages 1 to 4), a joyful ode to the everyday miracle of babies, with illustrations by Marla Frazee. ''Every day, everywhere, babies are born -- fat babies, thin babies, small babies, tall babies, winter and spring babies, summer and fall babies.'' These first lines are a microcosm of the book. Each double-page spread begins with the comforting repetition of ''Every day, everywhere, babies are . . .'' kissed, carried, etc., and each spread absolutely revels -- in the words and in the illustrations -- in the endless variety of babies and of the ways they are loved and cared for. All the scenes depicted are utterly commonplace, with topics like dressing, feeding and rocking. But by their loving presentation, these ordinary scenes take on the glow of the extraordinary; they gently persuade the reader to see babies, and perhaps even child-rearing, in a newly appreciative way. Meyers's rhymes are fresh and heartfelt. Frazee (the illustrator of Mem Fox's ''Harriet, You'll Drive Me Wild!'') wields pencil and watercolors with a child-pleasing realism and the knowing wink of a parent. Yes, the babies are cute, but not cutesy. The contrast of a skinny-legged, bald baby girl in a fussy dress keeps sentimentality in check, as do a howling baby trapped in a high chair and several sleep-deprived, disheveled mommies and daddies. Frazee's eye for real-world details extends to the myriad types of families she portrays. Her vignettes are decidedly multicultural, with families of all types, ages, and races, including interracial. Indeed, the subjects mirror the book's potential audience. Babies will respond to the soothing rhyme scheme, while older children will relish the interactive possibilities of a stanza like this: ''Every day, everywhere, babies are kissed -- on their cheeks, on their ears, their fingers, their nose, on the top of their head, on their tummy, their toes.'' Kiss every part mentioned and you're going to have a happy, giggling toddler who's picked up some vocabulary too. Julie Yates Walton",2001-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,'Savage Beauty'," Camden, with its ring of mountains rising behind the white clapboard houses facing Penobscot Bay, made the most of its view. Nowhere else on the coast of Maine was there such dramatic natural beauty. The houses were like weathered faces turned to watch the sea. The upland meadows of ox-eyed daisies, timothy, and sweet fern, the dark green woods of balsam and fir swept to the gentle summit of Mount Megunticook, and the rock face of Mount Battie rose from the edge of the sea as if to hold it. But it was a far less generous time than the early days of shipbuilding, upon which the town's wealth had been founded. Now even the great woodsheds along the wharves were mostly abandoned, permanent reminders of the long death of shipbuilding. The wool mills looming behind the town offered scant wages and long hours. Later in her life Edna St. Vincent Millay would say she was ""a girl who had lived all her life at the very tide-line of the sea,"" but in the fall of 1904, she moved with her family into 100 Washington Street on the far edge of town, in a section called Millville because it was near the mills.

Passing unmoved before a succession of paintings by such masters as Van Dyke and Caneletto, she suddenly finds herself transfixed before a marble monument by an unnamed sculptor. It is a scene depicting the death of the Princess Charlotte, daughter of King George IV. Stowe describes the sculpture in great detail. On the terrestrial side, the princess has just ""thrown herself over in a convulsion, and died"" (Stowe 1854, 2:45). Around her are four figures bowed in mute despair. On the celestial side, however, the princess's spirit is seen to rise toward heaven.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  LEWIN, DANIEL M.","LEWIN-Daniel M. The co-founder of Akamai Technologies, murdered on September 11th aboard American Airlines flight 11 which crashed in New York City. A resident of the Boston area, 31 years of age, Danny was born to be a leader and an inspiration to all he met. In a tragically short life, he excelled in each and every one of his endeavors, whether it be as a distinguished soldier, student, scientist, business figure and family man. With a multitude of interests, and a larger than life presence, Danny's passion, brilliant mind and warm smile were only some of his endearing qualities. Dedicated to his family, Danny possessed a unique ability to balance both the daily demands of academia and the workplace, with a constant flow of affection for his wife and children. While his accomplishments began to grow, along with his circle of friends, his modesty remained intact. He founded Akamai Technologies, in 1998, with his professor F. Tom Leighton and fellow graduate student, Jonathan Seelig. In a short time, and under Danny's harddriving leadership and vision, Akamai grew to be one of the top technology companies in the world. As chief technology officer, he was responsible for Akamai's research and development strategy, creating innovative Internet infrastructure services that would produce an entirely new industry segment, & forever change the way people and companies distribute content, data, and applications. Akamai's 1,100 employees and global customer base will miss him dearly. Born in Denver, Colorado, Danny immigrated to Israel with his family in 1984. Upon completing public high school, ORT, in Jerusalem, Danny served for four years in the Israel Defense Forces. He rose to the rank of captain in what is considered the Army's most elite unit. Following his active military service, Danny was married in Jerusalem and began his studies at the Technion, Israel's premier technology university. Soon after, Danny worked at IBM's research laboratory in Haifa, where he was a full-time research fellow and project leader while simultaneously completing two undergraduate degrees, computer science and mathematics summa cum laude, and celebrating the birth of his first son. In 1995, the Technion named him the year's Outstanding Student in Computer Engineering. At IBM, he was responsible for the development and support of the company's Genesys system, a processor verification tool that is used widely within IBM and in other companies such as AMD & SGS Thompson. In 1996, Danny and his wife, Anne, welcomed their second son and moved to Cambridge, Mass. where he received a scholarship to study at MIT under the tutelage of MIT Professor, and soon to become close friend, Tom Leighton. He published and presented several breakthrough papers at top computer science conferences and received several awards, including the 1998 Morris Joseph Lewin Award for Best Masterworks Thesis Presentation at MIT. His Master's thesis included some of the fundamental algorithms that make up the core of Akamai's services. He received a Master's degree from MIT in 1997 and was a Ph.D. candidate in the Algorithms groups at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science upon his death. His embrace of risk, and affinity for speed and freedom, was also demonstrated by his personal pursuits: motorcycles, sports cars, and skiing. His love of country and appreciation for culture was shown in his early training in classical music and his knowledge of Israel's politics and history. In addition to his many friends and colleagues, he is survived by a close-knit family. Danny was a devoted husband to Anne, his companion throughout adulthood, a fellow immigrant to Israel, and a student and teacher of art and literature; a loving father to sons Eitan and Itamar; loyal son of Drs. Charles and Peggy Levine, and brother to Jonathan and Michael, of Jerusalem. Contributions in Danny's memory can be made to the Daniel Lewin Science Scholarship Fund, dedicated to providing scholarships to students pursuing careers in science.

A reporter and editor for the New York Times for 37 years until his retirement in 1991, died on September 10, 2001, at NYU Medical Center. He had covered news on many fronts from city and state politics to retailing, and had also been editor of the real estate section. The cause of death was a sudden recurrence of prostate cancer, quiescent since its inception nine years ago. Throughout his last six years Glenn waged a valiant, all-out battle to transcend the effects of his 1995 stroke, and made dynanmic comeback after comeback until the end, never losing his indelible spirit, sparkle or infectious grin. Born in Manhattan, November 26, 1923, he was a graduate of Columbia University, did graduate work in political history at NYU, was a sports reporter for United Press and a news reporter for Women's Wear Daily before joining the Times. For many years Glenn was a colorful cast member of the riotous annual political lampoons staged by two noted New York journalist groups -the Inner Circle and the New York Financial Writers Association -and also was a longtime member of three others, the Silurians, the Downhold Club of UP Writers and the National Real Estate Editors Association. During W.W. II he served as a lieutenant in the Navy, often in the thick of action in Europe. One hair-raising instance he survived took place on Normandy Beach where the landing craft of soldiers he commanded was shot out from under him by enemy fire as he landed it, after which he was rescued by another landing craft and took over for its skipper who had just been killed. Until his stroke Glenn was an avid skier and runner who completed 12 NYC Marathons and several in Boston and China. A distance runner who was never lonely, he made friends everywhere, continuing to do so throughout the years of his stroke. Overcoming the terrible loss of speech he had sustained from the stroke with his signature grin and a personal sign language he continually created with a dedication he brought to everything, he kept up a continuous regimen of therapies that helped him often to free himself from wheelchair and cane, and travel, swim and dance almost as before. Glenn is survived by his beloved and devoted wife Jessica and daughter Kathryn. He will be mourned by a legion of close friends. Services will be held on Sunday, September 30, at 3 PM, at the Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street.

Wherever he went he made friends; with his kindness, sweet nature, sense of humor, intellectual quickness, and sincere interest in people he was the exemplar of the term ''GreatGuy''. Frank attended The Elisabeth Morrow School, he graduated in '77 from Dwight-Englewood School and earned a B.A. at Skidmore College in the Class of 1981. Following college and a ''tune-up'' of winter mountaineering in the Adirondacks High Peaks he hiked the Northern section of the Appalachian Trail from Maine to Pennsylvania and then joined his family's manufacturing company, Natalie Lamp & Shade Corp. Afterwards, he was an equities trader with Franklin Resources and for the last 5 years has been at Cantor Fitzgerald's trading desk on the 104th floor of the WTC.

Elias Levy, chief technology officer at Security Focus, a computer security company, said the program is technically considered both a ''virus,'' which is a type of program attached to other programs or documents and typically spread via e-mail, and a ''worm,'' which attacks other computers directly. Mr. Levy said the program did not appear to cause damage to infected computers. The program does, however, consume processing power as it seeks to attack computers -- a phenomenon which appears to have slowed down Internet traffic.

The company, which supplies telecommunications network components, added $1.1 billion to its previously reported losses for its third quarter and $4.2 billion to its fourth quarter. The $5.3 billion in losses, like the bulk of those previously reported, reflects the difference between what JDS paid for a number of acquisitions and their worth after the crash in technology stocks. But because JDS paid for the acquisitions with its own inflated stock, the red ink is largely a matter of accounting. JDS also said it was adding $76 million to the $270 million it wrote off in its fourth quarter to reflect the declining value of unsold products in its inventories, a move that suggests that the downturn in demand for its products has worsened since July. Still, JDS shares rose 35 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $5.70. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2001-09-20T05:00:00+0000

In addition, Cable and Wireless said that the remainder of its fiscal year promised to be equally as weak as the first half.

But the company lowered its fourth-quarter prediction to 27 or 28 cents a share, from 31 cents, because of rapidly declining sales in Japan and weak demand among American ''creative professionals.'' Bruce Chizen, chief executive of Adobe, said the forecast did not take into account the potential impact of last week's terror attacks, which he said would hurt Adobe's business if they pushed the economy deeper into its malaise. In light of that risk, Mr. Chizen said, ''anything I say today would be nothing more than a guess.'' Adobe's shares fell $4, to $26.10. Chris Gaither (NYT)",2001-09-20T05:00:00+0000

Many surface coatings do not fully protect leather against spills like red wine or against moisture from wet bathing suits. Both can leave permanent stains. Acqua, a new upholstery leather, has waterproofing that penetrates the hide, making it protected enough to be used at poolside or on a boat. A liquid left on it for 10 hours will not leave a stain, which means this covering might last even in a child's playroom. The slightly grained leather comes in 17 colors and costs $5.95 to $8.50 a square foot, depending on the quantity ordered. (An 84-inch sofa will require 250 square feet of leather. The lower price applies to orders of more than 1,000 square feet.) From Spinneybeck, 105 Wooster Street (Spring Street).

Before the World Trade Center attack, electronic dance music showed a growing infatuation with music from the Arab world: a source for fervently rough-hewn voices, plaintive string phrases and pinpoint hand-drum rhythms, providing very human elements amid computerized mixes. This album, one of the countless ethno-techno descendants of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' by David Byrne and Brian Eno, is a collection of studio-made dance tracks that mesh Middle Eastern elements with a synthetic dance-floor pulse. The studio overseers come from Europe, the United States and Canada, but they all seem enthralled by their musical partners, among them singers from Algeria (Dahmane El Harrachi) and Egypt (Amir Abdel Magid). Karsh Kale, a tabla player and dance-music producer, comes up with a three-continent collaboration -- North America, Africa and Asia -- that juxtaposes Indian sarangi (bowed lute), gruff Arabic vocals and a house-music thump. Except for the cheesy final track, ''Euphoria's 1,001 Dreams,'' the hybrids find a middle ground where neither side is stifled -- the kind of collaboration that could now be threatened by a new xenophobia.",2001-09-21T05:00:00+0000

Born in Vienna, Austria, she emigrated to the United States with her husband and young children in 1938, shortly following the Anschluss. She resided for many years in Forest Hills, Queens and later in West Stockbridge, MA. She was an artist and art scholar, a member of Artists Equity, and had a long and prolific career as a portraitist, still-life and landscape painter. She accrued an outstanding art library and slide collection. The latter contained unique views of museum quality. The entire collection of slides was donated to Dartmouth College. Her expertise as an art scholar was recognized by the United States Information Service for which, in 1956, she gave a series of lectures in France on American Art. During her years in West Stockbridge she was active in the community, and continued to foster her academic interests by sponsoring art scholarships for local high school students. In many ways Suzanne Porges was symbolic of the generation of immigrants from Central Europe who grew up in the early years of this century only to have their secure family life and intellectual milieu interrupted by the Second World War. Many assimiliated Jews could not meet the stringent requirements of Aryan purity imposed by the Nazis. The coming of Hitler forced upon her the recognition of her ancestral roots. While not raised as a Jew, her journals reveal that she had no doubts of her ancestry, and how she would be treated. It was her sensitivity and appreciation of imminent danger that prompted her to write to a close acquaintance, William Rosenwald, only a few days following the German annexation of Austria. His assistance enabled the family's rapid exodus from Europe, sparing them catastrophe from the Holocaust. Her family attributes its survival to her vision and initiative. She survived her husband of 38 years, John C. Porges, a prominent obstetriciangynecologist in this city. She is survived by her sons, Robert F., of New York City and Brookfield, CT; and his wife, Dr. Felicia Axelrod; George W.

It was March 16, 1998 -- eleven years after Pope John Paul II had asked the Commission to determine what responsibility, if any, the Church bore for the slaughter of millions of European Jews during World War II. For the Church, a more explosive subject could hardly be imagined. It had been thirty-five years since Rolf Hochhuth's play The Deputy had first raised the charge of papal complicity in the Holocaust, triggering Catholic outrage worldwide. Yet the suggestion that the Vatican bore any responsibility for what had happened to the Jews continued to grate on Catholic sensibilities. And so nervousness mixed with curiosity as the report was finally released to a public sharply divided between those worried that it might criticize the Church, and those who feared it would not.

Mr. Valdes was born in Philadelphia, December 22, 1923, the son of Mr. and Mrs. V. Francisco Valdes of Ithan, Pennsylvania. He attended the Haverford School and graduated from St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island in June of 1941. Mr. Valdes entered Princeton University, but left to become a Naval Aviator and torpedo bomber pilot aboard the aircraft carrier ''Fanshaw Bay'' during the Okinawa campaign. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and four Air Medals upon his release from the Navy in 1945. Mr. Valdes returned to Princeton to graduate in 1948. His interest in the ''Triangle Club'' dramatic group led to his employment at CBS Television in New York as a special effects supervisor on many of the pioneering CBS network shows including ''The Jackie Gleason Show'', ''Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''Studio One''. He was later employed as a television account executive with BBDO advertising agency in New York and Detroit, working on network television shows for the Chrysler Corporation. For several years in the midfifties, Mr. Valdes was co-owner of Radio Station WCUE AM/FM Akron, Ohio. For many years Mr. Valdes was a director of several New Jersey banks, finally retiring to Florida after the merger of the First Colonial National Bank with the First Fidelity Bancorporation. Mr Valdes is survived by six grandchildren and four daughters; Mrs. Stacy Lorenceau of San Martin, California, Ms. Midge Valdes of New York City, Victoria McKellar of Phoenix, AZ and Ms. Fleury Kelly Valdes of Unionville, Pennsylvania and Southern Pines, North Carolina.

us,"Smart Women, Foolish Marriages","The characters in DARLING? (Picador USA, $23), Heidi Jon Schmidt's second collection of stories, tend to be women of formidable intellect -- they're too smart for the terrible emotional places where they find themselves trapped. Some of them are married to much older men, academics or writers to whom they have attached perhaps more than a modicum of their identities. ''No one is better fitted to see all that's wrong with me,'' the narrator of ''Songbirds'' says of her intellectual husband. In another story, a slightly less self-deprecating narrator and her husband, a poet, spar over a guest list, only to find themselves ''arguing about grade inflation in the universities, the empty 'self-esteem' that leaves students feeling proud, proud of themselves without all the bother of accomplishing anything.'' Schmidt's bitter wit, shot through with insecurity and self-conscious braininess, calls to mind Lorrie Moore, but her voice isn't derivative. Despite the tangled lives these women lead, Schmidt's stories are tinged with hope, and even when the author is at her most biting you rarely suspect she has any contempt for her characters. Often her target is larger, like the cult status enjoyed by creative writing; in a Cape Cod workshop, one of the students carries a popular writing manual along with ''a collection of aromatherapy sachets for writers, with scents for lyricism, insight, courage.'' And at the same time that she calls the importance of intellectualism and art into question, her precise and elegant prose is smart and artful indeed. Emily Hall",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Victim of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Born Sept. 25, 1950 in Brooklyn, NY. Frank grew up in Rockville Centre the eldest of six children of the late Frank Sr. and Mary Brennan. At 6'7'' and with a soft hook shot he was one of the stars of the legendary St. Agnes High School Basketball Team of the late 1960's where he was tabbed with the nickname Zelmo. Frank graduated from St. Agnes and went on to star at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, CT. While his stature made him hard to miss visually it was his good nature, sense of humor and generosity that separated Frank more than his physical prowess. After graduating from Quinnipiac Frank went on to manage and own several nightclubs on Long Island, most notably Solomon Grundy's of Bay Shore. In the early '80's Frank took his talents to Wall Street where he ultimately became one of the best and most well known Government Securities brokers. There are few in the business who haven't been touched by him. A longtime bachelor he found the love of his life and wed Barbara Hanley in 1988. Of all his successes Frank was most proud of his association with The New York Police and Fire Widow's and Children's Benefit Fund where he was recently named to the Board of Directors. Along with Barbara Brennan of Oak Beach, Long Island Frank is survived by his mother, Mary of New Canaan, CT and his brother Brian and sisters Kathleen Carey, Ellen Flaherty, Mary Jones and Sarah Jerome.

Joe, the son of Irish immigrants, grew up in the Bronx where he attended Fordham Prep High School. He graduated from The University of Wisconsin in 1972 and received an MBA from SUNY Binghamton. Over the past twenty years, Joe worked tirelessly to build a successful career on Wall Street. At the time of his death, Joe was a Managing Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, working in the Interest Rate Swaps department. He was on the 105th Floor of Tower 1, directly above where the first plane hit. Honest almost to a fault, generous and kind, Joe was greatly admired and respected by all who knew him. He was an eternal optimist and had an unforgettable passion for life. But Joe always measured his own success on how good he was to his family. And he was an exceptional husband and father. He taught them to embrace life, take on new challenges and to love the outdoors as much as he did. In their early years together, Joe introduced Irene to the city and took her on long strolls in Central Park. On Fire Island, Joe taught his children how to swim out past the break, how to stay on top and out in front of the ocean's barrels. He coached his children's basketball teams, sat proudly on the sidelines at Joseph's crew regattas, and never missed an opportunity to play the back nine with Elizabeth. A savvy New York sports fan, Joe took the kids to see the Knicks, Rangers and Yanks, and enjoyed catching the Wisconsin Badgers on TV and talking sports with those around him. Although Joe has been taken from us all far sooner than we were ready to give him up, the whole family feels blessed to have had him in our lives. His smile and laugh will remain with us forever. Please join the family on Friday, September 28th to remember and celebrate the extraordinary life of Joseph Dermot Dickey, Jr. A memorial service will be held at 10:30AM at St. Mary's Church in Manhasset, followed by lunch at Leo's, a local restaurant.

I ignored the sound, took a shower instead, wondering about the sports page: had Roger Clemens won his 20th? The phone rang, and a friend asked: ''Did you see it?'' So I went to the window, and saw. In this part of Brooklyn the towers are the nearest bit of Manhattan, easily visible from upper stories or rooftops. Neighbors commute -- excuse me, commuted -- to them by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. Both planes had arrived by the time I looked out the window. My denial slid from the fact of it -- they're on fire, wow -- to tangential irritations, stuff I had to get done this week. I'd re-enact this denial again and again in the next hours: the mind's raw disinclination to grant this new actuality, cognitive dissonance run riot.

us,The Way We Live Now: 9-23-01; Love Lost,"I remember very well the day my father died. It was the early morning of a Saturday in 1960. I was 16. My father was 55. I was awakened by the sound of his loud breathing -- gasping, really -- and by the sound of my mother's voice from the room beside mine. We lived in a new suburban house in Mississippi. ''Carrol?'' I heard my mother saying. ''Carrol, wake up.'' Her voice was pleading, becoming uncertain, becoming afraid. My father's heavy, gasping breaths continued. I got up and walked down the short hall to the open doorway of his room and looked in. As it was so long ago now, I don't remember if my mother was leaning over his bed, or sitting on it, or if she was touching him, or standing beside him shouting. I only remember that my feet were cold because it was February. And I remember my pajamas being blue. And I remember that what I did was get on my knees in my father's bed and shake him, shake his shoulders, pat his face -- he seemed to be sleeping, possibly having a nightmare -- saying as I did the name I called him. ''Daddy, Daddy, wake up.'' I could smell his large, sweaty body, feel his flaccid self, loose-limbed and malleable, his cheeks and mouth relaxed. He had quit gasping. I tried to open his mouth with my fingers and breathe in air. I tried to push down hard on his chest. I tried to move him. I put my arms around his shoulders and shook him. I heard my mother say, ''Oh, God, no, no, no.'' And I felt dread and terror, love and ferocity, confusion, physical exertion, a need for greater ingenuity, for greater efficiency, and I felt failure. In short, I experienced all the small and large coefficients of a son's unswerving love.",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

In both cases, the protagonists get in their own way.

Yvan plays, well, Yvan, a man who has to wrestle with his small-minded jealousies over his wife's make-out sessions with the suave British actor (Terence Stamp) she's working with, an envy compounded by her ease with English and Yvan's lack of fluency.",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Just a couple of weeks ago, I would have dismissed the exchange of civil liberties for safety as a false trade-off. But then I didn't know what it felt like to see even network news anchors grow nervous inside their New York skyscrapers. Every other American-fought war taking place during my adulthood has felt, by comparison, like a media event. Grenada? The gulf war? Army exercises and fireworks displays, with the same relationship to national defense as a burlesque extravaganza has to romantic intimacy. Now I understand the urgent patriotism Steven Spielberg was trying to get across in ''Band of Brothers,'' in retrospect the most prescient television program of the days before the attack.",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

For the responsibilities of government were not to be lightly cast aside; in her own words: ""My subjects are my first children."" Finally, at about half past eight in the evening in her apartments at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Maria Teresa gave birth. It was a girl. Or, as the Court Chamberlain, Count Khevenhuller, described the event in his diary: ""Her Majesty has been happily delivered of a small, but completely healthy Archduchess.""

Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Baxter received his bachelor's degree from Penn State. He enjoyed a 30-year career as a photographer in advertising, fashion, art, dance, theater and music. He taught at the New School for Social Research, the NY School of the Arts, and the School of Visual Arts in NY. After the loss of his sight forced an early end to his photography career, Mr. Baxter became a Gestalt therapist, practicing privately in NY and CT and at Samaritan Halfway Center in NY. A close friend of many NY artists, he was also a jazz enthusiast, a world traveler, and an avid collector of African sculpture from the Ivory Coast, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Burundi, serving as a docent at the Museum for African Art in NY. He also studied sculpture, and later taught at the San Diego Center for the Blind in Vista, CA. Family and friends will fondly remember Mr. Baxter for his honesty, compassion, integrity, wry sense of humor, and his gentle, courtly manner. Mr. Baxter is survived by his wife, Deborah, his children, Sherri, Dana, and Anthony, and his five grandchildren.

us,'Political Fictions'," Early in 1988, Robert Silvers of The New York Review of Books asked me if I would do some pieces or a piece about the presidential campaign just then getting underway in New Hampshire. He would arrange credentials. All I had to do was show up, see what there was to see, and write something. I was flattered (a presidential election was a ""serious"" story, and no one had before solicited my opinions on one), and yet I kept putting off the only essential moment, which was showing up, giving the thing the required focus. In January and February I was selling a house in California, an easy excuse. In March and April I was buying an apartment in New York, another easy excuse. I had packing to do, then unpacking, painting to arrange, many household negotiations and renegotiations. Clippings and books and campaign schedules kept arriving, and I would stack them on shelves unread. I kept getting new deadlines from The New York Review , but there remained about domestic politics something resistant, recondite, some occult irreconcilability that kept all news of it just below my attention level. The events of the campaign as reported seemed to have taken place in a language I did not recognize. The stakes of the election as presented seemed not to compute. At the very point when I had in my mind successfully abandoned this project to which I could clearly bring no access, no knowledge, no understanding, I got another, more urgent call from The New York Review . The California primary was only days away. The Democratic and Republican national conventions were only weeks away. The office could put me on a campaign charter the next day, Jesse Jackson was flying out of Newark to California, the office could connect me in Los Angeles with the other campaigns. It so happened that my husband was leaving that day to do some research in Ireland. It so happened that our daughter was leaving that day to spend the summer in Guatemala and Nicaragua. There seemed, finally, no real excuse for me not to watch the California primary (and even to vote in it, since I was still registered in Los Angeles County), and so I went to Newark, and got on the plane. From the notes I typed at three the next morning in a room at the Hyatt Wilshire in Los Angeles, after a rally in South Central and a fundraiser at the Hollywood Palace and a meet-and-greet at the housing project where the candidate was to spend what remained of the night (""Would you call this Watts,"" the reporters kept saying, and ""Who knows about guns?

It is often said, for example, that ''Alabama,'' a prayerlike dirge written by the saxophonist John Coltrane and recorded by him on Nov. 18, 1963, was his saddened and outraged response to a church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., two months earlier. The bombing, which took the lives of four young girls, was a turning point in the civil rights movement. Yet if this was what Coltrane meant for the piece to be ''about,'' he kept it to himself in the recording studio, not saying a word about the deaths of those children to the pianist McCoy Tyner or the drummer Elvin Jones, both of whom were sidemen at the session. As far as they remember, the piece didn't even have a name yet. They remember being moved by the piece, but they don't recall Coltrane saying anything at all about the killings after handing out the sheet music.",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Because America is a nation of immigrants, its history was a constant struggle by outsiders seeking to become insiders.

Spiritually, he underwent similarly radical conversions, from being an atheist to becoming a born-again Christian who prayed with the televangelist Billy Graham. He was also a short-lived Moonie, founded the Cleaver Crusade for Christ in 1979 and the following year formed his own religion, Christlam, along with an auxiliary called the Guardians of the Sperm.

us,QUICK BITE/Maplewood; South of the (South Orange) Border,"There are enough Chinese restaurants in Maplewood and the surrounding towns and villages to build another Great Wall, and more than enough Italian restaurants to feed the extended Soprano family countless meals. But a good, inexpensive Mexican restaurant was as hard to find as Pancho Villa -- that is, until the unassuming Carmelita's Cafe opened here. It offers the standard Mexican fare -- tacos, burritos, enchiladas, fajitas and quesadillas -- all freshly made, served hot and spicy. Add to that the homey dcor and good cheer of its owner, Carlos Aguirre, who grew up in Los Angeles, and his wife, Arlene, who was raised in Hoboken. Mr. Aguirre -- who learned how to cook from his father, a Chihuahuan, and his mother, who came from the hills outside Mexico City -- met his wife in San Francisco while working in the restaurant business, and together they came to New Jersey. The first restaurant they opened was in Hoboken, where they operated for 11 years. But they moved to Maplewood in April because the space in Hoboken was small and the rent not nearly so. This is the real deal, and at a reasonable price, with dinners ranging from $4.75 to the most expensive, at $10. Appetizers cost from $2.75 to $6.50. The friendly atmosphere is free, and so is a peek at the alligator (just ask Carlos). The menu boasts, ''Mexican food so authentic you'll think twice about drinking the water.'' Well, the water is fine, but there is no liquor license, so bring your own tequila.",2001-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  STERN, ISAAC","STERN-Isaac. The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the death of Maestro Isaac Stern-renowned violinist, master teacher, beloved colleague and dear friend. Mr. Stern's remarkable career, which spanned more than sixty years, was inextricably linked with the Philharmonic since his debut with the Orchestra in 1944 in a Sunday radio broadcast featuring the Sibelius Violin Concerto, led by Dimitri Mitropoulos. His solo appearances with the Philharmonic numbered more than 100, including the 1960 gala concert led by Leonard Bernstein to benefit Carnegie Hall after its rescue from demolition, an effort spearheaded by Mr. Stern. In 1980 the Philharmonic was honored to celebrate his 60th birthday with a televised concert featuring Mr. Stern as soloist as well as his protegees Pinchas Zukerman and Itzhak Perlman, evidence of the breadth of Mr. Stern's legacy. In 2000, musicians of the Philharmonic also participated in the joyful celebrations marking Mr. Stern's 80th birthday, as well as his 40th anniversary as president of Carnegie Hall. He had most recently appeared with the Orchestra in September 1998 as the special guest soloist for the Philharmonic's Opening Night Concert conducted by Kurt Masur. In recognition of his many decades of outstanding music, as well as his peeless efforts to advance music and its message throughout the world, in 1992 the New York Philharmonic named Mr. Stern an Honorary Member of the Society, the highest honor the organization bestows. From his devotion to saving and sustaining Carnegie Hall to his vital role in the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts to his enthusiastic dedication to the education of young musicians, Mr. Stern set an exemplary standard for musicians and arts organizations everywhere. He will be greatly missed, but we are grateful for his music, his teaching, and his friendship, lasting legacies that will continue to enrich and instruct us all. The entire New York Philharmonic family-Board, Orchestra, and Administration-extends its heartfelt sympathies and warmest regards to his entire family.

With profound sadness, the Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc., mourn the passing of our great friend, musician, humanitarian and national treasure, Isaac Stern. During his more than 60 years on the world's concert stages he was an inspiration to audiences and to all who knew him. Through his leadership he redefined what it meant to be a musician. While he once described Carnegie Hall as ''an affirmation of the human spirit,'' he himself was the incarnation of the human spirit. His vision and energy had a profound impact on the cultural life of this great city, an impact that will be felt for generations to come. He led the fight to save Carnegie Hall confirming New York's position as the capital of the music world. Isaac paid no attention to obstacles in his life's many passions, in particular in his support of the State of Israel and to arts education. He touched countless lives; his legacy is immeasurable. Lincoln Center joins with Carnegie Hall and the global family of music makers and music lovers in mourning his loss. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Linda, his sister Eva Hornyak, his children Shira, Michael, and David, and to his grandchildren. Beverly Sills, Chairman Gordon J.

The only other mechanical-action pipe organ in the state is at the Princeton Theological Seminary.

It was built to fit this relatively small church, which has a congregation of about 300, and designs from the interior were incorporated into the cabinet of the organ, said Mark Trautman, the church's organist. Christ Church was founded in 1745 and was the site of the third public reading of the Declaration of Independence. The church's old organ was damaged by lightning in 1995.

Watts II of Freedom, New Hampshire and Boston, Massachusetts, died unexpectedly of a heart attack yesterday at his farm in New Hampshire. He was the beloved husband of Patricia McQuillen Watts. Born in 1926 in Bronxville, New York, Mr. Watts was the only child of Charles H. and Mabel L. Watts. He married Patricia Dorothy McQuillen, also of Bronxville, in 1951. After completing his Ph.D. in American Literature at Brown University in 1953, he became an Assistant Professor of English at Brown and was later named Dean of the College. In 1963, at the age of 37, he was named President of Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he served for twelve years, leading the school through an important period of change and growth. Following his time at Bucknell, Mr. Watts returned to Brown University to help launch a major capital campaign. He then joined Beneficial Financial Corporation (later acquired by Household Finance) in the position of General Director. Mr. Watts, whose father, Charles H. Watts, was one of Beneficial's original founders, was also a member of the Beneficial Board from 1959 until 1998. He received honorary degrees from Franklin College (D.Lit., 1965), Dickenson School of Law (L.L.D., 1968), Alderson Broaddus College (H.H.D., 1969), Brown University (L.L.D., 1975), and Bucknell University (L.H.D., 1979). Throughout his career, Mr. Watts served on numerous academic, corporate and civic boards. He was a member of the board of the Riverdale School (1959-1974), Bucknell University (1964-1976), the Peddie School (1971-1985), and St. John's College (1976-present). He was also an active board member of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. In addition to the library, he was deeply committed to Trinity Church, in Boston, and the Society for the Preservation of New Hampshire Forests in Concord, New Hampshire. Mr. Watts was an avid conservationist throughout his life and worked with both the Audubon and New Hampshire Forest societies to preserve the natural environment in New Hampshire. Mr. Watts and his wife opened High Meadow Farms, in Freedom, New Hampshire, in the mid-fifties with the late Percy Taylor, also of Freedom. The farm, which operated commercially for nearly forty years, sold eggs, apples, wood and hay. Mr. Watts is survived by his wife, Patricia, and their three children: Katharine L. Watts and her son Cooper; Caroline W. Collins and her husband Peter and their children Dylan and Abigail; Charles H. Watts III and his wife Holly and their children Samuel, Isabel, and Isaac.

A crew member in blue jeans strolls briefly across the frame, picking up slack camera cable. The chastizing voice of Joplin's mother can be heard off-camera, making the singer's face crumple. But this is not some newly discovered, archival Joplin footage.

us,Shapeliness Got in the Way,"In 1933, three years before Walker Evans traveled to Alabama with James Agee to document the lives of tenant farmers for Fortune magazine, he went to Cuba on an assignment to illustrate the American journalist Carleton Beals's book ''The Crime of Cuba.'' Andrei Codrescu speculates in his essay in WALKER EVANS: CUBA (Getty Publications, $24.95) that Evans's publishers may have been disappointed with the pictures he submitted. Beals wrote a fervent expos of American complicity with the practices of the oppressive Machado regime; Evans captured more of the formal beauty of Havana. ''He tried to photograph misery, but shapeliness got in the way,'' Codrescu writes. Indeed, Evans's pictures are lyrical observations of Havana's streets and people: the cinema with posters advertising American movies, a crowd assembled on the steps of the Capitol, a barbershop, women and children in doorways, a shrine to the Virgin Mary. His images of prostitutes, the homeless, children and workers show the despair of unemployment and destitution, but Evans framed them within a ''cornucopia of formal elements,'' Codrescu remarks. ''Cuba's streets, buildings, slums, peddlers and beggars,'' he writes, ''were almost irresistibly photogenic.'' Evans's later, more celebrated photographs that appeared in ''American Photographs'' and ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' benefited from this trip to Cuba. In these striking pictures of Havana we see the emergence of Evans's style -- unpretentious, precise and poignant. Sarah Shatz",2001-09-30T05:00:00+0000

His ''enormously important book,'' which was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, is ''perhaps the best single account of Palestine under the British mandate,'' Omer Bartov wrote here.

While this is often a fulfilling choice, it is still a difficult one, and it explains in part why so few women make it to the upper echelons of law and business.",2001-09-30T05:00:00+0000

''For instance,'' she said, ''I might juxtapose a self-portrait by Van Gogh with a Japanese woodblock of a warrior. The warrior becomes an emblem of the interior struggle of Van Gogh.

His personal approval ratings in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War had reached 90 percent, unheard of for any sitting president, and even more remarkable for someone like Bush, a competent political insider whose charisma and capacity to inspire had in the past escaped most of his fellow citizens. Of his essential decency and competence there had been little doubt, and the skill with which he had presided over the end of the Cold War had impressed not merely the inner club that monitored foreign policy decision-making, but much of the country as well. With exceptional sensitivity, he had juggled and balanced his own political needs with the greater political needs of his newest partner in this joint endeavor, Mikhail Gorbachev. For Bush was quite aware that Gorbachev's political equation was much more fragile than his own, and he had been careful to be the more generous member of this unlikely two-man team that was negotiating the end of almost forty-five years of terrifying bipolar tensions.

Entering the city from the Basin (Bacino) as diplomats did in the Renaissance, you pass between two high columns on the Piazzetta by the Doge's Palace. One is topped, mysteriously, by a man standing on a crocodile that has a dog's head. The other has the city's famous emblem, a bronze lion with its wings spread for takeoff, its paws already dancing on the ground. It may not look so large, up there on its pillar, but it measures fifteen feet from the tip of its muzzle to the end of its tail and five feet from its perch to the small of its back. Viewed from the balcony of the Doge's Palace, or from the ground with opera glasses, it reveals its natty mustache over a leering grin, its opaque white eyes, its intricately curled mane -- not a lion one wants to be on the wrong side of. It has an exotic history. Restorers decided in the 1980s that the bulk of its body is roughly 2,300 years old. The city it guards is a newcomer to this veteran, who has seen empires rise and fall, but has spent his last 850 years at this sentinel post (with only a brief time of Napoleonic captivity in France).

As a nibbly with a drink (in Burgundy, Kir is preferred), they are just about perfect as bar food or as savory bonbons between the ordering ritual and the arrival of the bread, which is when they are served at Eleven Madison Park.

In an age when increasing opportunities and status are being accorded to women in a wide variety of faith traditions, it is puzzling that you selected one who has no independent status and whose life seems, in all essential areas, to be distinctly premodern. There are women who serve ably as ministers and priests, as bishops, rabbis and nuns. There are women whose scholarship is broadening our views of our religious traditions. These women did not acquire their roles by marriage, not even a marriage that was granted the imprimatur of her tradition's leader.

When Steven Harris, a New York architect, was asked to design a loftlike house for a woman in Mayport, Fla., his mandate was to make it flexible (to accommodate visitors) and low-cost (she wanted to maximize her retirement fund). So Harris began with the idea that ''the cheapest building would be a metal shed.'' Given the ''iffy'' neighborhood, Harris's design focused the house on a courtyard. He specified insulated panels for the interior walls, a material that he says ''looks like compressed shredded wheat'' for the ceiling, and commercial vinyl tile for the floors. And because the design is modular -- it's based on the dimensions of the sliding-glass doors he found at Home Depot -- it can be big or small. And at $45 a square foot, who's counting?

Midday pangs can be quieted with Anthony's sandwiches (all $5.50). The grilled pepper chicken sandwich, layered with goat cheese, caramelized onions, tomato, arugula and a tangy balsamic aoli, is a feast between slices of whole-grain bread. There are also a fresh mozzarella and tomato sandwich, dressed with basil pesto on a rosemary ciabatta, and a French chicken salad sandwich with Granny Smith apples and Swiss cheese. The shop can also help you impress your friends with a fancy ''homemade'' dinner. It might start with golden crab cakes, or a bowl of Mediterranean chopped salad studded with feta, roasted red peppers, and chickpeas. For the main course, there is pepper-crusted ahi tuna with soba noodles; spicy lamb sausage tossed with fresh herbs and tomatoes over pappardelle; or messy, juicy, barbecued pork chops (all entrees $9.75 to $22 a pound).

us,The Way We Live Now: 9-30-01: Close Reading: Elements of War; The Father Figure,"On a day when countless children in America lost their fathers, the rest of us started searching for a father, too. When a nation is under siege, it wants someone to tell us what to do, to protect us from bullies, to tell us that everything's O.K. and that it's safe to go home now. It's an impulse, perhaps, that we never outgrow. But as we've learned this month, the definition of what constitutes a plausible national father at a time of tragedy is as much in flux in the 21st century as the definition of war. F.D.R. and Churchill -- the patriarchs who served Western civilization during the greatest international conflagration of living memory -- projected a patrician, if not Victorian, authority that might not play today even if we had leaders who could match their eloquence. For that matter, our nation has become so much larger and complex since World War II that one size of national dad may no longer fit all.
