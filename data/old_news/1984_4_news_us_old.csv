Biographies, of course, have been obvious candidates for electronic reshaping, ranging from the recent tale of a female reporter who impersonated a male in ''Her Life as a Man'' to such more elevated projects as the forthcoming ''George Washington'' and ''Pope John Paul II.'' But equally in demand are the crisis stories that often make national and even international headlines. ''Missiles of October,'' for instance, offered a countdown version of John F. Kennedy's handling of the Cuban missile threat. ''Raid on Entebbe'' traced the heroism of the Israeli military in a daring escape plan. More recently, in a combination of the biography and crisis forms, ''Sadat,'' starring Louis Gossett, Jr., generated headlines of its own when the Egyptian government banned the film because, among other things, the title role was played by a black actor. In any event, it is getting to the point that any newspaper story involving a crisis or disaster of some sort prompts the reader to wonder which TV producer got there first with the fattest contracts for dramatization.",1984-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,FROM ASSURED DESTRUCTION TO ASSURED SURVIVAL,"-15- launched Miniature Vehicle ASAT (anti-satellite) and recent C.I.A. disclosures indicating that the Soviet Union is intensifying its missile defense efforts suggest that an era of superpower nuclear confrontation in space is quickly approaching. At least one scenario for such confrontation is especially worrisome. Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are actively investigating use of space- based directed and hypervelocity kinetic energy weapons, the so-called ''Star Wars'' technology, to provide defense shields against exo-atmospheric weapons like ICBM's and SLBM's. President Reagan, in a March 23, 1983, speech, offered the hope that such a system could provide a purely defensive solution to the arms race and make the concept of mutual assured destruction obsolete. Critics contend that the design goal of 99.9 percent effectiveness is unrealistic, under crisis conditions, for so complex a system and that a significantly less effective shield, because of overkill, would have dubious value. They also claim that a wide range of comparatively inexpensive countermeasures would be available to thwart the system. Possession, by either side, of an impregnable exo-atmospheric shield could be viewed as a guarantor of either peace or war. Our concern lies elsewhere, however. One scheme for a space-based defense system would entail a minimum of 400 shuttle launches for deployment, and any system now being considered is likely to compare in expense with at least one leg of the existing U.S. nuclear triad. If deployed over a period of years, an exo-atmospheric shield would present an opponent nation with a highly vulnerable target.",1984-04-01T05:00:00+0000

The faithful gathered, universities held seminars and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization arranged a December round table in Paris. Books poured off the presses but excited no one. Yet the faithful, one would have thought, had much on their side. When the greatest thinker in the history of socialism (the competition is not very great, but Marx was) died in London in March 1883, 11 people attended his funeral. Today, half the population of the world is led or governed in his name. In the first months of 1983, the world was still in recession. The international financial system was under severe strain; what Marx called ''the reserve army of the unemployed'' had grown to 30 million in Western developed countries. ''Bourgeois'' civilization and the power of private property were under attack internally and externally - if not by the working classes, then by teachers, minorities, women, environmentalists, pacifists, former colonial subjects and the poor everywhere. Conservative reaction there may be, at least at the ideological level - but bourgeois civilization, the world of self-confident liberal individualism, is dying, if not dead.

The photograph captures Sondheim during the rare public moment of a creative process that usually transpires in the privacy of his study, in the ultimate privacy of his mind. Sondheim is staring into Seurat's world - just as Seurat, brushes in hand, once stared at the Parisians in the park on the Grande Jatte - in order somehow to convey that world, to tramsute it into words and music. The terminus of those efforts is ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' the Sondheim-James Lapine musical that opens April 23 at the Booth Theater.

The emergency loan would allow Argentina to pay some of the $650 million in interest that must be paid by this weekend if United States banks are to avoid a sharp reduction in first-quarter earnings. In the talks leading up to the loan agreement on Friday, Argentina's blunt-talking Economics Minister, Bernardo Grinspun, said the banks' accounting problems were not his concern. His nation, now $47 billion in debt, has an estimated $1 billion in reserve, but Mr. Grinspun wants to use the funds at home, and put off payments on the nation's foreign debt until later in the spring, at the earliest.

But to a lot of people, it is the return of baseball, not the blossoms, that marks the change of season. Pitch by pitch, the summer begins. The season that opens tomorrow in Cincinnati, Baltimore, Kansas City and Anaheim, Calif., will be the 109th for the National League and the 84th for the American. This will be a noteworthy year in several respects. It will be the last for Bowie Kuhn as commissioner, and the first for Peter Ueberroth, who will succeed him after the Olympics, which he is running. Pete Rose, who will reach his 43d birthday in two weeks, is 201 hits short of Ty Cobb's record of 4,191. And the game itself can set a record if the major leagues top last year's attendance of 45,540,338. Baseball has done more than move people through its turnstiles, though. For more than a century, it has moved them to frame in memorable words their fascination with a game that Casey Stengel once described this way: ''I had many years when I was not so successful as a ballplayer, as it is a game of skill.'' With its stars, too, of whom Tommy Lasorda said the other day: ''These players today have driven a lot of managers to drink. But these guys have driven me to give it up.''",1984-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Israeli officials are approaching the issue with extreme caution and are wary of making any comments that could be construed as interference in American politics. They have limited themselves to formal policy statements that Jerusalem is their capital and the logical place for any embassy. (Page A1, Column 5.) Israeli artillery units fired on positions in the Syrian-held territory in the Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon. It was the first such shelling in months. A cease-fire was generally holding in Beirut, where there was only sporadic shooting. (A3:1.)",1984-04-02T05:00:00+0000

The South African Press Association news agency said five people were killed. The explosion, close to the seafront at a time when commuters were on their way to their offices, was the most dramatic incident of its kind since last May, when a car bomb went off outside a military headquarters in the capital, Pretoria. A police spokesman said no one had so far claimed responsibility for the blast. Suspicion, however, is bound to center on the outlawed African National Congress, the most prominent of the exiled groups opposed to South Africa's policies of racial separation. The organization recently suffered a crushing blow when Mozambique, its main black-ruled ally and rear base, signed a nonaggression treaty with South Africa, pledging to withdraw support for its military activities. The explosion today, police officials said, may have been designed to show that the Congress is still a force to be reckoned with. The African National Congress office in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, had no immediate comment on the explosion. Witnesses in Durban said the bomb exploded close to the offices of the South African Indian Council. That organization has agreed to participate in limited political reforms offered by the white minority Government to the Indian and colored, or mixed race, communities in South Africa but not to the black majority. The witnesses said they saw at least three bodies on Durban's streets, along with many injured.",1984-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Beyond that, the vote may have marked an important turning point in the tone and the substance of the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Just as New York brought out the most intense foreign policy debate so far, at times strident and highly personal, Pennsylvania, which holds its primary this Tuesday, is shaping up as a contest of the candidates' ideas on bread-and-butter issues. As the candidates swept into this economically distressed state after the political dogfight of New York, there was a noticeable change of tone. Mr. Mondale, who took with him his 45 percent victory and the nickname of Fightin' Fritz, arrived carrying a set of boxing gloves and bobbing to the theme song from the movie ''Rocky.'' But the first major event of the Pennsylvania campaign, a debate in Pittsburgh, was a gentlemanly affair, so polite and decorous that even the candidates took turns pitching cottonball questions. Aides to Mr. Mondale insisted he had not changed his attack strategy, which they credit with revitalizing his campaign. Mr. Mondale, they said, had only deferred to the wishes of the debate's sponsor, the League of Women voters, that the candidates avoid personal attacks. As proof, Mr. Mondale the next day was back to suggesting Mr. Hart was not ''surefooted'' and steady enough to be President.",1984-04-08T05:00:00+0000

During the 19th century, Washington was embalmed by protective admirers in the unreality of fabricated myths that, among other things, had him refusing to lie about chopping down cherry trees. The nation's first President was transformed into an icon, a national symbol whose somewhat forbidding portrait would adorn the dollar bill. Lacking the charisma or ideological passions of a John Adams or a Thomas Jefferson, Washington's historical image gradually became obscured by legends. It is only in the past couple of decades that serious efforts have been made to capture the flesh-and-blood man behind the image. That process is continuing with ''George Washington,'' an eight-hour mini-series that begins on CBS this evening, from 8 to 11, will continue on Tuesday and then conclude on Wednesday night.",1984-04-08T05:00:00+0000

He, too, started out as a church musician, but in his early 20's he turned exclusively to writing for the stage. Before that he had turned out a few sacred compositions, which after one or two performances in his home town of Lucca were forgotten. One of them was a mass, given its premiere in 1880, when Puccini was 22. It was resurrected in 1951 by an American priest, Father Dante del Fiorentino, who was doing research for a book on the composer, ''Immortal Bohemian.'' He had it edited under the title Messa di Gloria, and it had its first rehearing in 1952 in Chicago under the direction of Alfredo Antonini. The work turns up now and then in choral programs. One recording was issued here by RCA about 10 years ago but was subsequently withdrawn. Now there is a new one. It is performed by the Ambrosian Singers and Philharmonia Orchestra under the direction of Claudio Scimone, with Jose Carreras, tenor, and Hermann Prey, baritone, as soloists (Erato NUM 75090).",1984-04-08T05:00:00+0000

However, the Greek Government has repeatedly asked that the marbles be returned to Greece. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Melina Mercouri, the Greek Minister of Culture under the Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, and a passionate spokesman for the marbles' repatriation, argued that the sculptures were removed from the Parthenon without sufficient legal authority or payment - and that they belong in Greece because they form an essential part and symbol of Greek history and its national heritage.

A complex narrative, convincing descriptions of Warsaw, Moscow, New York, Rome and Amsterdam, the author's commitment to political morality and his faith in human decency combine to create ''a stunning and often moving experience.'' MAILER: A Biography, by Hilary Mills. (McGraw-Hill, $8.95.) Drawing on rumor, report and data - including ''an awful lot of straight talk'' about money - Hilary Mills has produced what our critic, Mark Harris, called ''a sound, solid, responsible, perfectly balanced, documented biography . . . which collects the man all in one focused piece as he has not been collected before.'' Her book clarifies Mailer the man and writer ''without celebrating him'' as it covers his life ''year by year, wife by wife, book by book, obsession by obsession.''",1984-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Long, Democrat of Louisana, was joined by 11 Republicans in opposing the resolution, which was sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennnedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. (Page A1, Column 6.) Nicaragua's Sandinista leaders are continuing to send military equipment to guerrillas in El Salvador and to operate training camps for them in Nicaragua, according to Western European and Latin American diplomats in Managua. The United States has been making such charges since 1980. Nicaraguan leaders, who do not explicitly deny all of the charges, say, their support is ''moral and political.''

Moreover, the fact that the seat was made of chestnut and carved to a wafer-thin edge led Schoellkopf to believe that this was the work of Ebenezer Tracy, an 18th-century furniture maker from Lisbon, Conn., whose beautifully designed and crafted Windsor chairs have been copied for well over two centuries.

us,"IN THE MIDEAST, A COLD PEACE","The Passover season seems to exert a peculiar attraction for Israelis to ''go down to Egypt,'' to use the biblical term for the journey to the land that our ancestors left some 3,500 years ago. I recently went to Cairo in search of an answer to the vexing question, What is the state of Egyptian-Israeli relations five years after the signing of the peace treaty? And after an extensive round of talks with leading officials, I returned with the impression that peace is alive, although not exactly kicking, at the moment. Egypt's Minister of State, Butros Ghali, is not far from the truth when he describes the current mood as a ''cold peace.'' True, the Israeli flag flies not only over our embassy but also over the impressive Israeli pavilion at the annual international Cairo trade fair. The Israel Academic Center has been functioning for nearly two years, organizing meetings between Egyptian and Israeli academics. Israeli tourists enjoy the warm welcome of ordinary Egyptian citizens and mingle freely without offense with Arab visitors from hostile countries. Airline and bus companies provide connections between the two countries, and Israeli ships pass freely through the Suez Canal. But there is a darker side to the coin. Cairo restricts Egyptian tourism and trade with Israel. Cultural relations, which had made a promising start, are virtually at a standstill. The Egyptian Ambassador, recalled 18 months ago in the wake of the terrible outrage committed by Lebanese Gideon Rafael, former director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, is author of ''Destination Peace: Three Decades of Israeli Foreign Policy.''",1984-04-17T05:00:00+0000

On the London stage, Clifford Mortimer was played by Alec Guiness, who was later succeeded by Michael Redgrave. This television version stars Laurence Olivier. The role clearly is a magnet for distinguished actors. In addition, Lord Olivier is joined by Alan Bates as the son through whose eyes we see the father.",1984-04-19T05:00:00+0000

Moscow promptly labeled the proposal - described by Pravda earlier in the week as a lot of ''noise'' - a propaganda ploy containing ''patently unacceptable conditions for verification.'' No doubt about it: Chemical weapons pose some of the most confounding verification problems encountered in the vast realm of arms control. Kenneth L. Adelman is the director of the Arms Control and Disarmanent Agency. For this very reason, the United States will be seeking some new and rather bold approaches, including an ''open invitation'' for international inspection on short notice of all military and government-controlled facilities. Overcoming the problems of verification is essential. Arms control is empty without compliance, and compliance without verification, particularly in a closed society, is impossible to establish. A ban on chemical weapons honored by open societies and violated by closed societies would be no ban at all. It would be unilateral disarmament in the guise of multilateral arms control.",1984-04-20T05:00:00+0000

''Victoria Station,'' about a taxi dispatcher first puzzled, then infuriated and finally converted to a sort of crazed camaraderie by an amiably uncooperative driver, may seem little more than an anecdote, a nostalgic throwback to the revue sketches its author wrote 20, 25 years ago. Yet it injects a strangeness, an unease, a distinctive Pinterishness into the kind of disembodied banalities every passenger must have heard bleated from office to taxi and back again. It leaves you wondering if you aren't hearing the two survivors of some unmentionable disaster playing out their last rituals in an empty, airless city.

President Reagan and his top aides also suspect, more dubiously, that chemical agents of some kind have been used by Vietnam.

us,USTINOV PLAYS BEETHOVAN-FOR LAUGHS,"As a schoolboy, Peter Ustinov made his acting debut in a dramatized nursery rhyme. His first review, memorialized in his school records, said he was ''adequate in the part of a pig.'' Since then, he has learned to mistrust critics and to diversify his art. Just turning 63, he is celebrated on several continents as an actor, playwright, director, novelist and autobiographer. Currently he can be seen in a favorite hyphenate as actor- playwright in ''Beethoven's Tenth,'' opening tonight at the Nederlander Theater. In Mr. Ustinov's new play, Ludwig von Beethoven suddenly returns to life and joins the household of an acerbic English music critic. Naturally, Mr. Ustinov plays the composer (George Rose is the critic), just as in earlier attempts at incarnation he has personified Nero, Sophocles and Samuel Johnson. Extending his range in the world of detective fiction, he has played everything from Belgian (Hercule Poirot) to Chinese (Charlie Chan). His finest role is, of course, himself. In that guise, he can sit back and be inimitably Ustinovian. A conversation with Mr. Ustinov is a Renaissance riff of free association, embracing such seemingly discordant subjects as the decline of civilization, famous old actors doing television commercials, frozen royalties and, whenever possible, Beethoven. Soon a hotel room becomes a United Nations of characters and voices. He had just come off the road. Beardless for Beethoven, he looked well-fed but less imposing in person than on screen or stage. Settling down with the first of several cigars, he said that he had been touring from Wilmington to Detroit, and at almost every stop an admirer had come up to him and reminded him of a past performance or a specific line of dialogue.",1984-04-22T05:00:00+0000

British officials say they believe the embassy's occupants include the gunman reponsible for the death of Constable Yvonne Fletcher and the wounding of the others. (Page A1, Column 6.) Libya responded to Britain's decision with ''surprise and indignation'' and accused the Thatcher Government of ''launching a campaign of hatred and racism against the Libyan Arab people.''

TRANSPORTATION TOKENS ADDED TO OLYMPIC ISSUES","The three commemorative coins made by the United States Mint aren't the only official numismatic issues of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Perhaps without knowing the hobby implications, commuters in the Los Angeles area are already using another set of numismatic commemoratives: a series of 24 transportation tokens bearing Olympic designs. The tokens, which went into use on Jan. 1, are more than just a means of calling public attention to the Games. They also are raising funds to help finance the huge cost of public transit associated with this summer's extravaganza. The tokens, made of brass, are being sold to commuters for 50 cents apiece---their value as bus fare---by the Southern California Rapid Transit District. However, they also are being marketed in uncirculated sets at a substantial premium, and proceeds from such sales are expected to provide the transit district with upwards of $1.7 million---enough to close the deficit it is likely to incur during the Games. Issuance of the tokens was the brainchild of Robert G. Hennkens, president of the Marketcom Group, a marketing organization in St. Louis. Mr. Hennkens had learned that because of the added transit service required during the Olympics, necessitating the acquisition of hundreds of extra buses and the hiring of hundreds of extra drivers, the Southern California RTD faced the prospect of a multimillion-dollar operating loss. It's anticipated that transportation of Olympic athletes, officials and visitors will require a fleet of 475 vehicles. Mr.Hennkens convinced transit officials that by issuing special tokens and selling them at a premium to collectors, they could close their budget gap in a relatively painless way and also reap promotional advantages.",1984-04-29T05:00:00+0000

A secondary index of consumer prices, to which Social Security increases and some cost-of-living increases are tied, did not move at all during March. Some analysts noted, however, that there could be problems if large labor unions react to record earnings and increase their wage demands.

us,FOR WAGES: NO BIG TAKEOFF IN SIGHT,"WITH profits rising strongly, prices climbing faster than a year ago and the unemployment rate falling, the stage seems set for wages to take off once again. This year's heavy bargaining calendar includes some powerhouse unions - the auto workers, miners and postal workers - and their leaders are making tough statements about hefty wage increases ahead. Washington fears that a few heavyweight wage pacts could push consumer prices skyward and endanger the recovery. ''The economic outlook,'' said Robert Ortner, chief economist for the Department of Commerce, ''is to a great extent in the hands of labor and management. But despite the springtime rumblings from labor and worried words from the Administration, the dam is not likely to burst on wages this year - or the next. Double-digit wage raises appear to be a fading memory, not a realistic fear for the immediate future. Though wages are expected to rise this year by slightly more than last year's 5 percent, organized labor is also expected to be less aggressive during the recovery under way than in any recent postwar recovery. Nevertheless, many labor analysts say 1984 may produce major innovations for some industries, such as lifetime job security and more flexible compensation packages. Labor's new moderation reflects sweeping changes in the environment in which labor operates - and in labor's attitudes resulting from those changes. The nation's unemployment rate, though down to 7.8 percent from 10.7 percent at the end of 1982, is still high by historical standards.",1984-04-29T05:00:00+0000

Sectional rivalries might seem unlikely in so compact a state, but geography and economics sometimes pull Connecticut in different directions. Fairfield County, with its affluent suburban towns and its sleek corporate headquarters, tends to lean toward New York, where many of its commuters work. Legislators from the area say their constituents sometimes pay more attention to what happens in Albany than in Hartford. Other parts of the state, with their picturesque villages and their older industrial cities, tend to feel more a part of New England. In Greenwich they follow the Yankees; in Griswold, they follow the Red Sox. More than baseball loyalties, however, were strained by the maneuvering in the General Assembly this spring over how to finance the renovation of the state's roads and bridges. After a difficult debate last year, Fairfield County lawmakers persuaded the Legislature to remove the 35-cent tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike in Fairfield and neighboring communities along the state's southern shore, on the ground that the tollbooths caused accidents and congestion. They are scheduled to be removed on Jan. 1, 1986. To raise money for the $5.5-billion, 10-year bridge and highway repair program, Gov. William A. O'Neill proposed in February to raise gasoline taxes and motor vehicle fees. But legislators from the sections of Connecticut without toll plazas proposed keeping - and even increasing - the tolls to hold down the tax increases.",1984-04-29T05:00:00+0000

The second was an equally strong impression that the country's troubles were anything but finished.

us,IN SHORT,"TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. By Gerald Petievich. (Arbor House, $14.95.) Susan Sontag once remarked that, for escape, ''I love to read the way people love to watch television.'' With ''To Live and Die In L.A.,'' reading is just like watching television; its characters and plot are straight out of an amiable, time-killing made-for-TV movie. Ace counterfeiter Rick Masters rules Southern California, but two treasury agents (among many others) are determined to put him behind bars. Richard Chance is a kamikaze cop who owes more than a little of his personality to Hicks in Robert Stone's ''Dog Soldiers.'' He's not above stealing money as well as classified evidence in order to assure that Masters gets his comeuppance. Also on the case is Jim Hart, a diligent, burned-out treasury officer who plugs away despite remorse over his wife's death. What does distinguish the story from a television melodrama is its liberal dose of sexual activity, some of it kinky. ''To Live and Die In L.A.'' is very much a male-dominated narrative. Men reflect on the mean streets they walk down; at one point a doomed crook muses, ''If there was anything he'd learned, it was that one simply could not be too cautious when dealing with the scum-of-the-earth.'' The bottom line here is that in Lotusland the good guys and the bad guys get all mixed up in the scum, and this world view makes Gerald Petievich's final resolution decidedly ambivalent.",1984-04-29T05:00:00+0000

Yet within 15 seconds during an earthquake less severe than the one in Northern California last week, the building was flattened. Fortunately, no such collapses occurred when towns along the Calaveras Fault in the San Francisco Bay region were rocked in the quake that registered 6.2 on the Richter scale at its epicenter, 12 miles east of San Jose. Some houses were shaken off their foundations, and the City Hall and Santa Clara County Building in San Jose were evacuated pending inspection for structural damage. The tremor's greatest emotional impact, however, was on people working in San Francisco skyscapers, which swayed for about half a minute. In recent years buildings dozens of stories high have been built in the heart of San Francisco as well as in Los Angeles. Both cities are near the San Andreas Fault, the source of numerous quakes, some of which have been been extremely severe. But none of that class has occurred since the high-rise building boom began. A 7 reading on the Richter scale is a ''major'' earthquake and an 8 is a ''great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. Sooner or later, both cities are almost certain to experience a great earthquake. No one knows how severe the damage would be, but steps are being taken to minimize it.",1984-04-29T05:00:00+0000
