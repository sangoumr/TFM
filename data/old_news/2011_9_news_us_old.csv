Such thinking, James said, isnt strictly wrong, but extremely wrongheaded, since all thoughts and feelings, including those of the medical materialists themselves, are organically conditioned and thus equally prey to being dismissed.

But like the earlier arrest of a person suspected of being a gunman, the announcement left unanswered the larger question of who ordered the killing of Ms. Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter who had persisted in writing critical articles about the war in Chechnya. The defendant, Dmitri Pavlyuchenkov, a former lieutenant colonel in a police surveillance unit, has denied the accusation. ",2011-09-03T05:06:12+0000

While his classmates began the timely process of adding up the numbers sequentially, the young wunderkind thought of a shortcut and arrived at the answer in a snap. What the young Gauss did was work from the outside in: he knew there were 50 pairs of numbers that added up to 100 (0+100, 1+99 etc. through 49+51), and that 50 times 100 is 5,000.

But Lindsay Degen, the Brooklyn-based 23-year-old behind the new hand-knit sock and lingerie line Degen, is a different sort of designer. Growing up in the suburban Midwest, she dabbled in cheerleading and Girl Scouting before going on to study fine art at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she joined a performance group called Knitting Nation that practiced endurance-building marathon stitch training. Soon, Degen says, a hobby turned into a job, and she started collaborating with brands like VPL, Cooperative Designs and Mischa Lampert. Knitting for people who see fashion and art as equals bent my previous view that they had to be separate worlds, she says. Indeed, Degen the line, which makes its debut during Fashion Week, is a clever blend of the two; the stripy, woven lingerie and cheerful one-off socks featured are just conceptual enough. Ive never wanted to buy a matching pair of anything, Degen says about offering singles instead of matching socks. Plus, when I spend eight hours knitting one, its dreadful to think that Id have to spend another eight hours making the exact same thing.

us,A Free-for-All on a Decade of War,"The American reaction to being attacked on Sept. 11 was in many ways an intellectual one. President George W. Bush tended to frame it that way: the attack was on our values, and the war against terror was a war of ideas meant to advance the idea of freedom. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was the administrations epistemologist, worrying over the question of knowability; Bernard Lewis was its historian, Paul Wolfowitz its moralist in arms. That Americas actions (as opposed to precautions) after 9/11 almost all took place far from home, with a professional army, strengthened this sense of abstraction. The possibility of anything like victory over our enemies was discounted early on (by Rumsfeld). Little wonder that, unlike in earlier wars, we have talked so much about what this conflict means, rather than simply working to end it as soon as possible.",2011-09-07T12:00:22+0000

Using elements of Manolos existing vocabulary  a heel here, a strap there  Gordon designed two different shoes for the show, an updated Mary Jane for day and a streamlined, stacked-heel sandal for night. It was something of Manolo Legos, the designer says of the process. The look is very Gwyneth from Great Expectations. Clean 90s minimalism done in a very luxe way. Expect timeless silhouettes done in surprising fabrications, like Lurex and stretch tulle. So many shoes out there are very aggressive or very cool, and make a statement.

It was precisely the kind of moment that the Romney campaign must have been hoping for, and thanks to the moderators questions and Perrys answers, it fell into Romneys lap without him having to even raise the issue. As soon as the exchange happened, a Romney adviser e-mailed Politicos Ben Smith: [Perry] has lost. No federal candidate has ever won on the Perry program to kill Social Security. Never has. never will. Thats spin, yes, but Im sure the Romney people believe the basic premise. As well they should.

When she went back to look for it some 20 minutes later, it was still there. Thats scary! Liden exclaimed the other morning, sitting at a table at Karma, Brendan Dugans bookshop and design studio on Downing Street in the West Village. The New York Liden lays bare in her new book, Out of My Mind  Back in 5 Minutes, is not the sort of place youd want to leave your personal belongings unattended. Trash bags pile up in the streets like body bags, a slick of dark liquid might be oil or it might be blood, even a rock in central park has the menacing look of a giant, gaunt-eyed skull. This is, of course, all a lot funnier than it sounds. The book is compiled from images swiped from the Internet, photos taken with a BlackBerry and installation shots from Lidens recent shows at Maccarone and Salon 94 including a series of self-portraits in which she wore various plastic deli shopping bags. A recurring chorus of slogans appropriated from souvenir T-shirts delivers the punchline. Of all the things Ive lost, I miss my mind the most.",2011-09-08T17:27:18+0000

After losing the finals of the U.S. Championships in 1919 to Johnston, Tilden realized that he would never beat him until he found an answer to Johnstons forehand drive to his own slice backhand. Tilden took the entire winter off to develop a backhand that he could hit flat, with top spin or with slice. Many consider it the finest stroke in tennis history. In 1920 he defeated Johnston in five sets in the U.S. Championships and never lost another important match to him. I often wonder why todays pros dont do the same thing. Its pretty clear that Djokovic has come up with a stylistic advantage over Nadal (similar to what Nadal has over Federer). It is a clich to say that the mental part of the game determines rivalries when style of play is significantly more important. Looking back over the past 10 years of mens tennis, you have to wonder: if Andy Roddick had been willing to make the changes to his game to beat Federer, would we be talking about the great Roddick-Federer rivalry?",2011-09-09T12:00:31+0000

Artists like Kurt Cobain expressed their appreciation; movie producers plotted deals; and a play about the bickering roommates was produced.

The drought is concentrated in the southwest, where 12.6 million people are short of water. The drought began in early July and has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up. The areas hardest hit are Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, the Guangxi Autonomous Region and the dense municipality of Chongqing. About 14 million acres of farmland across China have been affected, Xinhua reported.

(He memorably  a lot of what Hitchens has written merits the adverb  shot back that his antiwar critics were the sort who, discovering a viper in the bed of their child, would place the first call to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.)

Al Qaedas ideological trademark is to exhort ordinary Muslims to engage in individual acts of violence against those deemed enemies of Islam, specifically Americans, Jews and the infidel rulers of Muslim-majority states. And yet very few such attacks have occurred in the United States since Sept. 11, and certainly none comparable to the devastating events of that day. To emphasize just how surprising this is, Kurzman cites a 2006 online manual for aspiring jihadists that lists 14 simple tools that are easy to use and available for anyone who wants to fight the occupying enemy  they include running over someone with a car and setting fire to homes or rooms at sleep time. Kurzman, a sociologist who has written widely about Islamic reform movements, asks: If terrorist methods are as widely available as automobiles, why are there so few Islamist terrorists? In light of the death and devastation that terrorists have wrought, the question may seem absurd. But if there are more than a billion Muslims in the world, many of whom supposedly hate the West and desire martyrdom, why dont we see terrorist attacks everywhere, every day?",2011-09-09T16:09:43+0000

Tensions between Christians and Muslims are ascendant and members of the elite are leaving the country in droves while those who remain bemoan the masses as ignorant ideologues. This is the Egypt of Waguih Ghalis Beer in the Snooker Club, a coming-of-age novel set in 1952 that, much like The Catcher in the Rye in America, articulated the identity crisis of a generation. Ghalis characters  young, precocious, cosmopolitan  are lost in the bewildering aftermath of the military coup that overthrew the pliant boy-king Farouk. They pine for the easeful gambling, womanizing and drinking of the past even as they scorn both the ancien rgimes sordid pretensions and the new regimes inability to deliver on its vaulted promises; We have the worst of both systems, one of them declares, exasperated. Ghali, who published his novel in 1964 and committed suicide five years later in the bathtub of his British editors Primrose Hill apartment, took the fall of the monarchy as his subject. Still, his tale presents uncanny parallels to todays Egypt, where artists, intellectuals and youth at large are beginning to fashion a new cultural republic of sorts even as they also struggle to find their bearings.

Suvorin, complaining about the state of contemporary Russian literature, filled with its moral injunctions and its pious prescriptions for human behavior. The writer, he insisted should not be a judge of his characters or what they say, but an impartial witness. . . . Its time for writers, especially writers of real artistic worth, to realize . . . that in fact nothing can be understood in this world. In a real sense, these phrases encapsulate the Chekhovian credo: nothing makes sense, mediocrity is the true demonic force, life is weird and vulgar, judgment is irrelevant. And to many writers, post-Chekhov, this point of view has appeared very attractive. In English literature since World War II, two writers in particular have made this take on life and the human predicament their personal forte  Muriel Spark and Beryl Bainbridge. Bainbridge, who died last year, of cancer, at the age of 77, pushed this attitude of amused, quietistic indifference to its ultimate level.

My husband (Rag & Bone designer David Neville) called and said, Where are you? We need the turquoise trousers for the show.' By accident, Westman had selected a look that made it into the final collection, instead of an edit, to wear today, a mistake that was quickly corrected. Its the strongest Spring, yet, she said explaining her excitement at the 70s surf vacation and 90s rave culture-inspired pieces. She chose a minimal makeup look, so as not to compete with the bright colors of the clothes. Eyes were simply taupe Revlon 16H shadow in Addictive with a touch of Sueded Brow liner. Cheeks were tinted with a light bronzer and blush in Tawny Peach while lips were pale pink, coated with shine and patted with powder. Personally, I dont think lip gloss is cool. What is cool and consistently Rag & Bone appears to be grey nails. Jin Soon Choi took last seasons slate to a lighter shade of concrete- Revlons Smoky Canvas or Hazy. As for hair, Guido Palau admitted the idea was effortless, though the process was anything but. Eighty percent of the New York designers want ease. It always looks glamorous, he said. To achieve this, Palau tightly braided the underside of the models hair and then added extensions for length to create the illusion of fineness. He then used Redken Satinwear all over damp hair which he dried with a Mason Pearson brush and Sultra tools. The hair was then clamped at the neck with a Velcro strap to create a bob-like effect.

Last seasons wig-wrapped hair and black, fringed, pastel falls turned into effortless glamour this season, according to Rolando Beauchamp. Loose waves came by way of Bumble + Bumble Gel, a blow dry, and then a one-inch curling iron wrapped at the shaft of the hair, all set with Bumble + Bumble Grooming Creme and roughed up with BB Texture for a messy, matte finish. The last step ensured that nothing was too pretty or too shiny. Coons color-blocked looks were translated into Mark Rothko-inspired, multi-step eyes at the hands of the makeup artist Francelle Daly for NARS. Lavender-grey Lhasa was the primary shadow. Im obsessed with this shade, Daly said. Its rarely used for spring/summer collections. She also added a trio of pinks with an icy tone at both corners of the eye. The Rue Bonaparte Larger Than Life Eyeliner pencil, a natural beige, was used to neutralize under the eye while white Santa Monica Boulevard lined inside. Madison Avenue grey was drawn as triangles on the outer edge of the lid. Without mascara on the bottom lashes, this all contributed to a special effect accompanied by a raspberry lip.

This season I designed more liberally, drawing inspiration from Les Minets, a French/British hybrid movement of mod culture. These young men shunned bourgeois culture, but still dressed up.

Nearby, Frankie Rayder is pulling on a black and red plaid lumberjack shirt over the plastic-bag poncho shes wearing around her neck. Its a makeshift protective cover for hair damp with product and oil. Like the look at Helmut Lang earlier today, the mandate is wet, but Alexander Wang-style, which translates into Palau using Redkens Full Frame 07 All Over Volume Mousse to coat the head and then finishing off with Argan-6 oil right before the girls go out. To get a glint in the hair, is how Mr. Palau explained the addition of the multipurpose product. He is also adding extensions where needed and uses his Sultra curling iron for a little movement. With prints hitting the collection this season, Mr. Palau wanted to be sure the hair was edgy. Pulled back can look too pretty, he said, explaining the switch from last seasons low ponytail. Today shes let her hair down. Both Mr. Palau and Diane Kendal agree that Mr. Wang has a very specific vision for his woman. Shes cool, downtown, beautiful and raw, as Ms. Kendal sees it. For makeup, this means M.A.C.s black kohl pencil blended out around the eye and then removed with M.A.C. studio moisturizer and a cotton swab, only to be reapplied thereafter. Theres nothing on the face or lip. Nails are painted with Sally Hansens natural Parchment. Ms. Kendal has done this look before circa 1990. Calvin went there, she said before also calling out Helmut Lang. No doubt Mr. Wang remembers this girl and is now making her his own.",2011-09-10T22:05:39+0000

Organized by David van der Leer, the museums associate curator in architecture and urban studies, and Sarah Malaika, a project associate, To a Great City is a collaboration between the Estonian composer Arvo Part and the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta.

The locations include a green labyrinth created by the Battery Conservancy, an underground chamber at the Governors Island National Monument, and spaces in landmark skyscrapers that are normally inaccessible to the public. For a $10 admission fee, visitors will be given a map, directions and a one-day pass to each of the stillspots for a self-guided tour, which takes about three hours; reservations are recommended.

Better yellow and geometry than another repeat reference, though the look wasnt totally different from last time around. This collections an evolution from last season, not a complete change, Orlando Pita said. The hair has that feeling too. This meant a low side-parted ponytail instead of hair pulled back at the crown without a visible barrette. Clean, simple lines, is how Pita described the look he created using Phyto Volume Active Mousse, blow drying with a T3 featherweight Luxe, then sealing the ends with Phyto 7 and a T3 Single Pass iron. The hair was then scraped back into a ponytail with a part over the right eye. Pita used Phyto Finishing Spray and a little Shine Defining Wax to make it perfectly done. Nails were painted Este Lauders Nude Attitude, but it was the eyes that went a little wild. Tom Pecheux (Este Lauders creative makeup director) explained the Neutra connection by making references to large windows that let the outdoor weather into the house, which became a ray of yellow from Este Lauder Rain Boots shadow on the lid highlighted with Cyber Copper brown shimmer all the way to the brow bone.

The golden ratio or phi (1.61803) is a fascinating number that we have explored before in the puzzles, Moonlighting Triangles and The Golden Ratio Treasure. The ratio, which is approached to greater and greater precision by two adjacent numbers of the related Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13), has become part of popular culture, attaining almost mystical status. Images and video clips like the one above abound on the Internet, connecting the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence with art, architecture, cosmology, biology, aesthetics, poetry, music and many other fields. But how much of all this is true and how much is myth? Professor Devlin, who recently published a scholarly book titled The Man of Numbers: Fibonaccis Arithmetic Revolution, examined the evidence with a scientific eye and separated the wheat from the chaff. I present some of his findings below  in the form of questions to you, of course.",2011-09-13T01:42:26+0000

Odile Gilbert was on the other side of the space getting girls ready for what she calls the Sweet 16, an off-center part with a natural wave and one side twisted up and tucked in with a comb.

Deborah Lippman painted toes Fashion, her opaque beige, and fingers a custom variation of Lady Sings the Blues. The Mulleavy sisters asked her to up the amount of large graphite glitter in the polish rather than the standard mix of paillettes.

Using Nars products, he drew all over lids with the shadow pencil in Dark Night and then added Night Flight and Tropic, a turquoise glitter. Looks a bit like Edvard Munchs The Scream,' Kaliardos said laughing as he moved on from Van Gogh. Penny Lane cream blush was used high on the cheeks and to cover the lips, which were then coated with Pearl Beach eyeshadow and Na Na gloss. Dreamy and aggressive at the same time, he said.

This explains why the hair around the face was more tidy, parted in the middle, while the back was wild and messy. Orlandos own Dry Shampoo was used with Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray to coat the hair before braiding. The tail was then teased up between the lacing and Pitas Elevate Texture Spray added.

Mr. Mayer wanted to rewrite the book and to transform its muddled romantic subplot into a love triangle full of dramatic and comic tension. His boldest idea: turning one of the central characters, a flighty woman named Daisy, into a gay florist named David. The gender switch was meant to throw impediments into the main narrative, about a male psychiatrist who hypnotizes Daisy/David and then falls in love with her/his past self, a woman named Melinda Wells.",2011-09-15T12:01:12+0000

Sure, ghostwriters have something to do with this, but at least Outrageous! was about Charles Barkley  a controversial N.B.A. Hall of Famer who played with and against some of the leagues all-time greats. What has always confounded me is the sheer number of ordinary, even journeyman athletes who cash in by documenting their rise to midlevel greatness between hard covers. But since so many of them do it, here are my favorites. (Intentionally missing is Jim Boutons totally awesome, gossip-laden Ball Four.

The scheme pays homage to Randall Cunninghams glory days. The Eagles do not really drive down the field; they just string together amazing highlights, interspersing the occasional punt or baffling mistake. A typical play begins with two defenders knifing untouched through Philadelphias porous, inexperienced offensive line. Vick either gets flattened or performs some Matrix-style escape, scrambling for a big gain or tossing to a receiver who used the confusion to get wide open. Andy Reid calls for a timeout four or five times per half to impose order (teams only get three timeouts per half, but a 5-yard penalty is a small price to pay for the chance to install a precisely designed sequence of plays for Vick to scrap).",2011-09-16T13:00:31+0000

The book is about three college friends from Brown University, and at first taste  Ive been toting around an advance copy  it appears to be luscious: humane, recondite and funny. Part of the heavy anticipation for The Marriage Plot, though, is a simple emotional response: Weve missed this man.

I find the claim in last weeks letter about Hillary Clinton that Republicans dont play fair particularly delicious, because the Clintons are hardly known for playing political softball. To all of you paranoid folks, however: Republicans are not the cause of all of the problems of the Western world. We genuinely believe that government needs to live within its means, that it is not the governments role to try to socially engineer every problem and especially that the government is not the solution to our jobs problem. The Democrats controlled the House and the Senate since 2006, and Obama certainly got his health care program through.

I read a comment the producer made that they were not familiar with Laurie and had no idea that he was British; his American accent is that good.

Yes, dissatisfaction with his handling of the stimulus and recession factors into it, but more important, the left finds him politically feckless and to have abandoned principles without having won political battles. His desire to create comity is admirable in theory, but compromise for its own sake is neither effective nor politically desirable. Perhaps we on the left misjudged Candidate Obama, but his campaign rhetoric was far more progressive than his presidency has been. We know hes constrained by the Republican House, though there are areas in which he could achieve change, like closing Guantnamo, protecting whistle-blowers or, most important, withdrawing forces from Afghanistan. He could use ye olde Bully Pulpit to advocate progressive ideals vocally. Thats what the left wanted to see from Obama and why we are dissatisfied with him now.",2011-09-16T15:44:12+0000

It is worth debating whether a visit to this corner ought to be mandated for tourists; few spots so profoundly render the truths of New Yorks economic extremism. Liberal parents hoping to foster their own political values in their children might consider pilgrimages.

It is more markedly so in a collection assembled over time, or in the case of Jonathan Raban, over the two decades this eloquent Englishman has spent in America. Raban presents his selections humbly, mindful of the gap that separates American from British English. The longer I stay here, he writes, the more conscious I am of nuances to which I must still remain deaf. It is impossible not to take to the author of a book called Driving Home who reveals that on his arrival he made the greatest of idiomatic American mistakes: he bought the wrong car. Less than gently, the woman for whom he had crossed the ocean translates. What message does his black Dodge Daytona communicate? Midlife crisis, she answers. Who drives them? he asks. Kids.

us,Asked & Answered | Bruce Jay Friedman,"If there is an advantage to being an underappreciated novelist, it might be that when you get around to writing a memoir, the anecdotes of your life have not already been trotted out ad infinitum by book reviewers the world over. Such is the case with Bruce Jay Friedman, whose memoir, Lucky Bruce, will be published next month. On the strength of his early novels  Stern (1962), A Mothers Kisses (1964) and About Harry Towns (1974)  Friedman was a literary star, frequently mentioned alongside Bernard Malamud and Philip Roth. He hung out at Elaines; edited for legendary Magazine Management pulp journals, where he hired Mario Puzo onto the staff of True Action; and, later, moonlighted as a screenwriter (Stir Crazy, Splash), rubbing shoulders with Warren Beatty and Richard Pryor. Yet Friedman has always remained somewhat under the radar. In Lucky Bruce, readers get fresh, amusing stories from Friedmans life in letters  the time he provoked Norman Mailer into a fistfight by mussing his hair at a party, say, or was hired to write a script and introduced to his new secretary, a between-marriages Natalie Wood. The Moment caught up with Friedman, now 81, at one of his favorite Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, Chin Chin, to talk about his latest book.",2011-09-19T12:00:13+0000

Just because youre 35 doesnt mean youre not going to have breakouts, says Antonia Burrell, a straight-talking facialist-turned skin-care guru, whose namesake, all-natural year-old line has a rabid following in her native Britain. The problem, according to Burrell, is our higher levels of exposure to a host of complexion-wrecking factors like stress, pollution and the chemicals and hormones in food. Ive been doing this for 18 years and the phenomenon of older women breaking out is not something I would see 10 years ago, Burrell says. After having so many clients moan to me about their skin, I decided to do something about it  but I wanted products that were holistic and a pleasure to use, not harsh chemicals that would dry out your skin. And I wanted to make them anti-aging, too. At Shen Beauty in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, the only store in the United States that sells Burrells products, her multitasking, plant-extract-packed Cream Supreme moisturizer and deep cleaning Natural Glow Cleansing Oil are perennial best sellers. The co-owner Jessica Richards first tried the line just before the store opened late last year. My skin was completely broken out from the stress of launching a business, and this cleared it up in, like, three days, she says. Its like a natural version of Proactiv. People cannot get enough of this line. Burrells products are so popular at Shen that hers is among the 12 lines that will be available to order online when the boutiques retail Web site goes live later this week. Also in the works are plans to get Burrell to Shen sometime this fall so she can work her facial magic on the Brooklyn faithful. For those unwilling to wait, Burrell has a standing gig as a guest facialist at Harrods and also sees clients at the Urban Bliss spa in Notting Hill; appointments can be made through her Web site. But be aware  shes usually booked three months in advance.",2011-09-19T13:00:05+0000

Surprisingly, the title of this record, which was released last Tuesday to rave reviews, does not directly refer to Owenss childhood in the infamous Children of God cult, he said. Instead, the moody album  filled with heavy metal riffs that channel Fleetwood Mac, and light 60s strumming that brings you back to the Beach Boys, supported by hallowing gospels  reaches down deeper than that: to Owenss relationship with women, primarily his mother. This record is no doubt less lo-fi than their first, but the straightforward and honest sentiment Owens and the bassist and producer J.R. White bring feels evermore present. Currently on a United States tour, Girls talked to The Moment about their new song Honey Bunny, which Owens initially wrote using his cellphone, and the video, imagined by White.

The deal signed by Turkeys Prime Minister, Tayyip Erdoan, and Dervis Eroglu, the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, takes into account the legitimate, equal and inherent rights of the Turkish Cypriots like those of the Greek Cypriots over the whole continental shelf of the Island, it said. Turkey has called the search for gas reserves in Eastern Mediterranean by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot state a provocation, when Ankara supports sharing the regions natural resources equally between the Turkish and Greek communities. The energy reserves in the area have also been explored recently by Israel, which is likely to increase diplomatic and military tensions in the region. SEBNEM ARSU",2011-09-22T02:17:06+0000

Transplant centers already test both living and dead donors for those diseases, but many centers use an older type of blood test that cannot detect an infection that was acquired very recently. A newer technique, nucleic acid testing, can find infections earlier. For hepatitis C, for instance, the older test cannot detect the disease during the first 70 days after infection. But nucleic acid testing can find it after seven days. The newer test is already used to detect H.I.V. Infections in organ recipients prompted the new recommendations.

Milan, on the other hand, has been conspicuously lacking in luxury department stores. But that all changed earlier this month, with the opening earlier of Excelsior, a multilevel shopping destination with a fashion sense that runs the gamut from Dries Van Noten to Balmain (the renowned local boutique owner Antonia Giacinti is a consultant), a trio of restaurants from the local celebrity chef Davide Oldani and departments stocked with everything from retro-fabulous meat slicers to flower arrangements by the edgy florist Numero 9. The former cinema has been reimagined by the architect Jean Nouvel as an ode to the history of film: floors are laid out as parapet balconies, and wraparound L.E.D. screens show a continuous stream of film stills. Even the sales clerks dress the part.

You see him suddenly balance on one leg and turn the sole of his raised shoe upward so that he can slap out a beat with his hands; he even taps one percussive phrase on his front teeth. These are gimmicks. As with many of the greatest flamenco dancers, the intensity with which he presents himself is always on the cusp of absurdity. But he makes his effects feel both enjoyable and necessary. They work because theyre part of the witty, odd flamboyance that characterizes his dance theater, but even more because theyre part of the rhythmic outpouring that turns his dance into music. Though he shows that he can do quite an assortment of the foot trillings that abound in flamenco, he refuses to indulge himself in that kind of bravura: he steers clear of flamenco clich. Its extremely rare in any genre to see a dancer of this singular imagination and authority. ",2011-09-22T16:00:01+0000

So the citys cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, was understandably relieved when the museums board voted Wednesday evening to continue as an independent operation. This is a wonderful outcome, Ms. Levin said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Its great for the institution to be able to keep its mission intact and keep its collection under its own stewardship. Having been driven by financial straits to default on its construction bonds and sell its building on West 53rd Street, the museum had been considering a transfer of its collections to the Smithsonian along with a possible long-term loan to the Brooklyn Museum. Now, the museum said, it will attempt to move forward in its smaller building in Lincoln Square. The museum was rescued by pledges of donations from its trustees and from the Ford Foundation. The museum would not specify the terms or amounts of these gifts. The museum also announced on Wednesday that a number of institutions are interested in collaborations. People are increasingly recognizing the value and the excitement of folk art, outsider art, Ms. Levin said. Other museum directors are realizing how this could make a meaningful contribution to the kind of shows they want to curate.",2011-09-22T21:46:25+0000

He can attract scorn from hundreds of miles away. Everything about Cutlers career is polarizing: the gaudy statistics that contrast his 35-35 win-loss record; his penchant for turnovers; his snippy, irritable public demeanor; and his career-long association with mercurial offensive masterminds like Mike Shanahan, Josh McDaniels and Mike Martz, who only magnify his peculiar attraction-repulsion effect.Last seasons N.F.C. championship game became Ferris Cutlers Day Off, with the (somewhat) injured quarterback looking less willing than able on the sideline as his backups got battered by the Packers. It was the type of nonperformance that defines a career, fairly or not, and a win Sunday could deflect a tiny bit of criticism. Unfortunately, Cutlers Bears are 1-4 against the Packers in the past two seasons, and their offensive line is still bad enough to make even the toughest quarterback consider using a sick day.

This is also untrue. Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, very recently put out a press release entitled Pastor John Hagee Deserves Better Than False Accusations, in which he directly refutes such assertions.The article also grossly oversimpli!es a sermon Hagee gave concerning the Holocaust and the rise of modern Israel.

He was a Christianizing messiah. He was a pitiless slave master. He was a lionhearted seaman, a rapacious plunderer, a masterly navigator, a Janus-faced schemer, a liberator of oppressed tribes, a delusional megalomaniac. In Columbus, Laurence Bergreen, the author of several biographies, allows scope for all these judgments.

Bush and corporate stooges, along with the crazed New Yorker who tried to stab him with a No. 2 pencil after a news conference for Fahrenheit 9/11, not to mention the more heavily armed crazies who forced him to seek protection from ex-Navy Seal members after he denounced Bush at the 2003 Academy Awards. Moore also briefly wanders into the Mommy Wars, denouncing the pushers of baby formula. An entire generation of us were introduced in our very first week to the concept that phony was better than real, that something manufactured was better than something that was right there in the room, Moore writes.

In a telephone interview Mr. Mullin said that Paula Herold  a family friend who is a producer of Lysistrata Jones  reached out to him about helping improve the skills of the fictitious Athens University squad members, who show off basketball moves throughout the musical. I thought itd be fun to get involved and see what I could do to polish up the playing, make it look more authentic and sharpen the choreography for Broadway, said Mr. Mullin, who was born in Brooklyn. Only so much basketball polish can be achieved in five days, he said, so he plans to focus on fundamentals like dribbling, passing and body movement, as well as off-court swagger and attitude. The Lysistrata actors current skills range from good to minimal, people involved with the show said. The men in the cast, below left, will attend the camp for its entire run, while most of the women will attend the first two days. Several of the women play cheerleaders who also handle the ball here and there, a spokesman for the show said.

The original manuscript of that novel, titled The Narrative of John Smith, was lost in the mail en route to Conan Doyles publishers, and though he later rewrote it from memory, the book was never published in his lifetime. Conan Doyle was later to remark: My shock at its disappearance would be as nothing to my horror if it were suddenly to appear again  in print.",2011-09-26T14:11:23+0000

She is now represented by Honor Fraser in L.A. and Anthony Meier Fine Arts in San Francisco and was recently commissioned by LAND (Los Angeles Nomadic Division) to do an installation in a former Masonic lodge in Marfa, Tex. On view through Dec. 4 as part of a suite of public projects, Forget Me Not takes its name from the flower pin once worn by the Masons and later adopted by the Nazis.

Its like a big family dinner where everybody shows up, says Erwan (above, seated). The family, in this case, is the brothers radically original work, from Lit Clos of 2000, a raised, semi-enclosed bed like a bird cage, to Ploum, a new sofa for Ligne Roset, which they compare to a very ripe fruit. This is the Bouroullecs first major show in their native France, organized by ambience and demarcated by supersize versions of their room-divider designs, including the plastic seaweed-inspired Algues and their textile Clouds; one long wall will hold nearly 300 drawings. To coincide with the show, Phaidon is releasing a new monograph of their work. Were still young, so a celebration of our career is nice but a little anxiety-inducing, said Ronan, the older of the two, who recently turned 40. Each time we do an exhibition it feels like: thats done, lets move on to something else.

us,On Ducking Challenges to Naturalism,"In response to the question posed in my previous essay in The Stone  What is naturalism?  Alex Rosenberg defines it as the philosophical theory that treats science as our most reliable source of knowledge and scientific method as the most effective route to knowledge. His post, Why I Am a Naturalist, nicely exemplifies one of my main complaints, by leaving it unclear what he means by science or scientific method, even though it is crucial for what he is committing himself to as a naturalist. Still, there are clues. He describes the test of knowledge that scientific findings attain as experimental/observational methods, which suggests that theorems of mathematics would not count as scientific findings. The impression is confirmed by Professor Rosenbergs phrase mathematicians and scientists, as though he doesnt see mathematicians as scientists. Thats bad news for his naturalism, for mathematical proof is just as effective a route to knowledge as experimental/observational methods. Of course, since the natural sciences depend on mathematics, Rosenberg desires to find a place for it  but admits that he doesnt know how.",2011-09-29T00:15:21+0000

One of the high-ranking officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing, said some details were pending, but he expected a final version to be agreed upon by the two sides in the coming week. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, thus far, has cooperated with the plan, the official said. The agreement, if finalized, would be an important breakthrough in the standoff between the governing party and the opposition. However, the actual transfer of power document, known as the gulf initiative, would still have to be signed by the Yemeni vice president in order for a full transfer of power from Mr. Saleh. Mr. Saleh made a surprise return to Sana on Friday after nearly four months in Saudi Arabia.

The present government has wanted Agathe Habyarimana to return home to Kigali to face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. Although living in France, she was refused political asylum in 2004 and lost her appeal as well, because French judges had found she was a central figure and exercised real power in the Hutu government that orchestrated the genocide. Yet she was allowed to remain in France and her extradition was not expected this time because French courts have previously refused to hand over suspects to Rwanda for fear that they would not receive a fair trial.

Following the elections on June 29, deputies of the Peace and Democracy Party, or BPD, have refused to take their oaths in protest of court rulings that barred six of their elected members, currently in jail on terror-related charges, from joining the assembly. Security operations against Kurdish political activists with suspected links to the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Kurdish southeast cast a shadow over political efforts to resolve the conflict, analysts say.

The project is really fueled by the widespread misconception of Africa as an impoverished or unpeopled expanse, said Adjaye, who was born to Ghanaian parents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Matchups,"Jets (2-1) at Ravens (2-1)Sunday, 8:20 p.m.Line: Ravens by 3.5.Any team coached by a member of the Ryan family does not so much play a 16-game schedule as careen from bitter rivalry to bitter rivalry, each game becoming the kind of over-boiled grudge match usually settled with suplexes and folding chairs at ringside. It happened to Buddy Ryans Eagles, and it has happened to Rex Ryans Jets.Jets-Cowboys becomes Rex Ryan against Rob Ryan. Jets-Patriots becomes Rex Ryan against Bill Belichick. Jets-Ravens devolves into Rex Ryan against the team that declined to promote him to head coach when he was its defensive coordinator. Next time the Jets face the Raiders, it will be Rex Ryan against the team that broke his quarterbacks nose. Even Rex Ryan could not muster a feud with the Jaguars, but Joe Namath got into the act this week, so if you play the current Jets against the 1968 version in a video game, that is now a grudge match, too.Granted, the presence of the ex-Ravens Bart Scott, Jim Leonhard and Derrick Mason on the Jets roster does give the game a familiarity-breeds-contempt angle. This is a family game, but its also a heated rivalry, said Ravens defensive end Terrell Suggs, perhaps not realizing that Jets charity softball tournaments are also heated rivalries.

Mosquitoes in Milan and grasshoppers, er sauterelles  not the garden variety  at the Musee de Rodin: oh my! The look, according to Pita was very fresh and modern, turning a page from the past, at least for this season. This meant a twist of a bun with a side part and slight wave in the front created by using Pitas Plump for volume, control hairspray and dry shampoo. The trick was that there was no ponytail beneath to hold the hair; it was deceptively simple. For makeup, McGrath went with a contoured eye and classic, beautiful red lip. One of the 28 members of McGraths team brought a face by for her approval. Dont forget, kids: not a hard lip with pencil, I prefer the finger, its softer. This is what made the lady modern. Three of Diors reds were used, chosen based on the clothes: red orange, blue orange and pinky red. Nails were also a mix of five shades: Incognito, a nude; Riviera, an orange; Waterlily, a green; Forget me not, a lavender; and Lucky, a red.",2011-09-30T19:39:21+0000
