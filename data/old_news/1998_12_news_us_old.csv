Died in Hackensack, New Jersey, on Thursday, December 3, 1998 of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) Blanche, ''Blimi,'' was born, October 9, 1923, in Brooklyn, NY, the youngest of six children of Israel and Hinda Roth. A precocious observer of people and customs, she wrote poetry from childhood onwards. She grew up in a warm family environment, surrounded by her brothers Jack, Bill, Irving and Nat, her sister Reggie and many friends and relatives. The strong memories of these early years are the foundation of the stories she wrote about growing up on 46th Street. She attended PS 169 in Boro Park, Pershing Junior High School and then graduated Summa Cum Laude from New Utrecht High School. Blanche attended Brooklyn College, graduating with a degree in psychology. During WW II, while brothers Nat, Bill & Irving served in the Army, she worked at the Norden Bombsight factory. After the war, she served as a social worker for the American National Red Cross, and then as a field organizer for the Pioneer Women. She married Jacob Drillick in 1948, and was instrumental in the success of Jack's companies, serving as business manager. She lived in London, England during the 1970's and traveled to Israel, Europe, Hawaii and Australia. Blanche was the Coordinator of the Hackensack Municipal Volunteer Corps from 1991 to 1993. She received several awards for this work, including the United to Serve America Diamond Award, and was the subject of an article in the NY Times. In recent years Blanche pursued her lifelong love of writing and painting by attending many shows, workshops and classes. Her work is being published by the family: here is a thought from one of her poems: ''Life is truly beautiful, if one does not forget, To welcome joy unabashed, if one continues, To greet with wonder each dawn.'' She is survived by her children Ira, Anne and David: Ira's wife Barbara and son Benjamin; her brothers Nat and Irving, their wives Harriet and Shirley; her sisters-in-law Anne and Claire, and many loving nieces and nephews.

Room 108, one of six newly created junior suites (there is a sitting area in the room), is done in gold-tinged beige damask, used with abandon for bedspread, curtains and the four-poster bed. The hotel's decor could perhaps best be described as eclectic coziness. A partial inventory of more than a dozen artifacts in our room included a 19th-century traveling escritoire, a dressmaker's dummy, a large wooden shop sign in the shape of an Elgin watch face and the ''Summa Theologica'' of Thomas Aquinas in eight volumes.

But the snowdrops are still very distant this month, too far away to anticipate, and the midwinter moment is dark and uninspiring.

Citicorp has a matching gift plan that doubles any employee's gift to a favorite charity, to the tune of $7 million in 1997. The new policy won't take effect until next year, and Citigroup promises to honor any multiyear commitments made by the old Citicorp.

us,Still Boasting at 50: 'Party of the Year',"Dec. 7: The Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art celebrated its 50th anniversary ''Party of the Year,'' the museum's largest annual benefit. This year, it raised more than $1.5 million and drew 3,150 guests. The first party, in 1948 at the Rainbow Room, was attended by 400 and raised $20,000. Irene Lewisohn and a group of her theater friends founded the institute in 1937 as the Museum of Costume Art, at 16 West 46th Street. They had been collecting costumes since the 1920's for their Neighborhood Playhouse, on Grand Street. When Seventh Avenue was cut off from Paris by the war, they opened the collection to the fashion industry. At first, the party was a fashion industry event, with live pageants. The collection moved to the Met in 1946, and the first party held in the museum was in 1960, the year the institute became a full-fledged department. It wasn't until 1972 with the arrival of Diana Vreeland and her extravagant exhibitions that the party evolved into the city's top social event. Since Ms. Vreeland died in 1989, the eight galleries have been cut back to three and the party's guest list has begun to shift back to members of the fashion industry, with fewer movie stars and society guests.",1998-12-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Frogs Without Hope,"Gahan Wilson turns his pictures into thousands of words in THE CLEFT: And Other Odd Tales (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), a collection of meticulously eccentric stories. But the illustrations are definitely the icing on this devil's food cake of a book. The best story is the tenderly heartbreaking ''Frog Prince,'' about a poor little creature with a recurring dream about a kingly father and a spell that until broken holds him fast in the loneliness of his watery world: ''Frog watched from his lily pad, confident that the magic would work on its own, that his salvation was approaching.'' Salvation, alas, is not an option for most of Wilson's characters. Spiders devour the curious, sea gulls wreak vengeance on the guilty, cats claw their owners to death -- and what people do to people is even worse. The title story, about monks decorating the precipitous route to their mountainside shrine, is a brisk lesson in human folly. In ''The Power of the Mandarin,'' a fictional character undoes a real-life foe, thinking: ''The idiot had discovered Evan Trowbridge's strength, which was implacable hatred, but he had shared, and therefore missed altogether, his weakness, which was a lack of sufficient imagination.'' Happily, this is a weakness that Wilson doesn't share. Andrea Higbie",1998-12-13T05:00:00+0000

At that time, in the early 1980's, I had begun writing fiction myself and was on the lookout for work that wouldn't be all that taxing, leaving certain parts of my brain fresh for plot development of my own. I ended up working for a small publisher in New Jersey, where I condensed remaindered novels that arrived by the cartonful. On the florid covers, couples sprawled all over each other, dressed in late-70's fashions -- a tumble of sideburns, flared pants and bare midriffs. Books were selected using a complex type-size-to-page-number ratio: large type size plus short page count was the ideal. Victorian novels, with their pesky sense of history, frequent hansom rides and miniature type, were avoided. Plots were incidental -- they all had the same plot anyway -- and 10 of these novels were eventually jammed into two digest-size magazines.",1998-12-13T05:00:00+0000

There is no money for it in the district's budget, though, so the district is appealing to public generosity for the $40,000 it will cost. There have been various fund-raising activities, but the chief draw is a coloring book created by some of the children the playground will serve, pupils at the George E. Bailey Middle School. The theme of the book, titled ''Children of All Kinds,'' is that whatever their differences, all children need love. The book, ($4.95) is sold at stores in the area and by telephone at (609)465-2724, extension 777.

us,Through Prague to Lhasa,"A man returns to his childhood home in Prague after many years and nervously climbs the stairs to his father's empty study. On the desk he finds a mysterious red-lacquered box, which was off limits to him as a child. He unlocks it with a rusted key, and finds inside ''pages and pages of fragile paper covered with faded handwriting and fine drawings and maps blending into the text, all of it barely holding together, like brittle autumn leaves.'' It's a diary kept by his father when he was lost in Tibet in the 1950's -- and ground zero for all the magical stories that later captivated his son. That is the swift and surefooted set-up for the enchanting TIBET: Through the Red Box (Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25) by Peter Sis, best known as a writer and illustrator of children's books. His father, a documentary filmmaker drafted by the Czechoslovak Army and sent to China to teach and make movies, was stranded in Tibet during the construction of a highway across the Himalayas. His diary, embellished with factual notes in the margins, is interwined with Sis' own recollections of his father's encounters with nomads, yetis, lamas who fly like kites -- and with a magical blue lake where the fish have human faces. His wanderings culminate in a visit to the Forbidden City of Lhasa, where he tries to warn the Dalai Lama of the threat posed by the coming highway: ''It might well bring hospitals, electricity and technology, but little roads will then go to the lake, to the Valley of the Yetis, to the caves and monasteries. What will it take away? It might take more than it brings.'' All this is accompanied by exquisite illustrations of his father's adventures, finely detailed mandalas and dreamlike images that provide a rich counterpoint to the simple, direct text. Younger readers will be transported by the folk tales and the artwork, but this is more than a ripping yarn: with its mystical underpinnings and the muted sadness that washes over the whole enterprise, it is a personal account of a son still struggling to understand the absence of his father, and poetic testimony to the power of the imagination to transfigure reality.

Starting primarily as a bitter religious struggle, it gradually became a naked clash for power among increasingly aggressive states of Europe and ravaged much of modern-day Germany. For one distinguished historian, Veronica Wedgwood, writing in the appeasement-stricken England of the 1930's, this ''futile'' struggle was ''the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict.''",1998-12-13T05:00:00+0000

One bite of the tender, spice-infused cake, with a hint of molasses, made me think of an old-fashioned Christmas.

Each generation is blessed with relatively few individuals with the vision, the passion, the selflessness and the means to have an effect on the larger community.

Designed by Milton Glaser, Walter Bernard and Mirko Ilic, the animation is a stylish, three-dimensional ode to Manhattan, which travels up Broadway between West 72d and 83d Streets, where Meg Ryan's character lives. Since Upper West Siders are quick to spot phoniness, the designers sent a photographer to shoot every single building on both sides of Broadway. Not every building made the final cut. ''We deleted some blocks that were boring,'' Mr. Ilic said. The result is a dreamy, autumn-hued abstraction of the city, which gets more lifelike as the sequence progresses. The colors were inspired by the 1932 painting ''Virgil and Dante in Union Square'' by Isabel Bishop. The designers sought verisimilitude, but their virtual Upper West Side improves on the real thing. ''We eliminated the people, the noise, the litter,'' Mr. Glaser said. ''It's probably a more benign and harmonious West Side than there will ever be.'' PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN",1998-12-17T05:00:00+0000

''The idea of the center is to be a magnet for youth,'' said David Burney, director of design for the New York City Housing Authority, which chose Pasanella & Klein Stolzman & Berg Architects, in Manhattan, to design the center. ''It can't look like a school or a fortress.'' It doesn't. Wayne Berg, a partner in the firm, said, ''It looks like a glass building, and the perforated-aluminum screen looks like a panel around it.'' The glass will allow light to pour into the steel-framed building; the screen will stop anyone from tossing a rock through the glass. The center, budgeted at $6 million, is scheduled to open in 2001.",1998-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Though best known for singing on the first album by the Velvet Underground after Andy Warhol pushed her on the band, Nico also recorded some seminal solo music, ranging from elegiac originals to stirring numbers by others like ''These Days,'' written for her by Jackson Browne. These first 10 years of her 23-year music career are the focus of ''The Classic Years,'' and though calling them ''classic'' may not be accurate, they are definitely her best years and a good place for the Nico neophyte to start.

But in discussing that issue, the Democrats were also playing to an emerging theme in popular opinion that the impeachment process is being guided by Republican muscle rather than sober judgment.

His lively, tightly arranged small-group ''choro'' music bears similarities to early 20th-century Cuban bands and even American pre-jazz: it involved intricately entwined sprouts of melody and it was rooted in European dance forms: quadrilles, waltzes, habaneras.

Born in Hammond, Indiana on December 2, 1915, to Samuel & Jennie Kleinberg Levin, Sylvia was an alumni of Indiana University where she met her husband and fellow alumni William Silberstein. They subsequently married in 1937, and lived in Hammond until 1950. She and her family moved to Scarsdale in 1950 and to Rye, New York in 1968. Sylvia will be most remembered for her great sense of humor, buoyant spirit and constant smile. Her charm was contagious and she was adored by her many friends. Sylvia was noted for her culinary expertise, her love of classical music, the theater, tennis & was often consulted for her vast knowledge of travel due to her extensive world travel. Sylvia was a longstanding member of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club since 1955. She possessed sound business acumen and helped her husband found Sealectro Corporation in Mamaroneck, New York. She was also very active in the creation of various philanthropic programs. In 1984, Sylvia and her husband established the first fully endowed athletic scholarship at Indiana University and thereafter two additonal endowed athletic scholarships. Their other philanthropic endeavors include the William & Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University Medical Center, the William & Sylvia Silberstein Cardiac Center at White Plains Hospital Center, and most recently, the William and Sylvia Silberstein Pavilion at White Plains Hospital Center. Sylvia supported many other charities including Cystic Fibrosis and U.J.A. amongst others. Her generous philosophy was apparent during World War II when she was President of Hammond, Indiana chapter of B'nai B'rith and she established a welcoming committee for all servicemen's trains providing food and other nourishment to them.

Furious about war and oppression, and suspicious of consumer society and its profit-driven blandishments, Gang of Four took its pleasure from dissonance and propulsion. Its songs are schematic constructions of rugged backbeats and guitar jolts, topped by intellectual one-liners like ''We've all got opinions, where do they come from?'' The two disks in this compilation each mix early and later songs, with the band gradually accepting melodies and turning from drums to drum machines while keeping its edge.

The disco crooner's recent detention for indecent exposure earned him more attention stateside than he has had since the early 1990's. His long fight with Sony, no longer his label, certainly hurt him, but this set reveals another reason he might have dropped out of favor here. From ''I Want Your Sex'' to the new ''Outside,'' in which Mr. Michael brazenly endorses al fresco eroticism, these songs focus on the delights and difficulties of promiscuity. The ballads portray Mr. Michael reaching shamelessly for love, and the lush music breathes seduction. The dance numbers, their rhythms more intimate than aggressive, detail the more pragmatic aspects of getting down. Some tracks drag, and others overdo, but mostly Mr. Michael finds true inspiration in the bedroom. Mainstream America can be prim about such matters. This music makes a good case for loosening up.

He chose his commercial side, returning to the come-ons that had served him so well with ''Let's Get It On,'' and ''Sexual Healing'' gave him both the hit he wanted and another indelible song. This two-CD set, pairing the original album with alternate versions and outtakes of its songs, reveals some of the changes Gaye made; altering rhythms, editing, bringing out hooks and replacing lyrics about trouble and uncertainty with promises of pleasure. Hearing vocal parts by themselves for some songs shows that Gaye never left doo-wop behind. But the best part of the expanded album is that it provides extended versions of Gaye's supple, undulating grooves, an ingenious and constantly mutating blend of electronics, funk, Caribbean rhythms and deep soul.

If this one is an exception, it's only because Mr. Waits produced and compiled it, sequencing the songs sonically and thematically instead of chronologically. It collects tracks from each album he recorded for Island, beginning in 1983, which represented a stylistic shift for the stertorous Mr. Waits expanding his skid-row cabaret with more difficult and unconventional yet more focused, inventive and theatrical material. Though the CD makes a good companion to the earlier ''Asylum Years'' collection, for Tom Waits fans, ''Beautiful Maladies'' is just familiar songs in a new sequence.

But they appear unlikely to suffer defections by business leaders who back them. ''I'm proud of the Republicans, in the face of the polls, doing what they think is right,'' said Robert Mosbacher, President Bush's Secretary of Commerce and a Houston oilman. David H. Koch, a senior officer of Koch Industries, the nation's second-largest private firm, says an ouster of President Clinton, far from rattling the economy, might aid it.

In spite of the somewhat lackluster telling, Empereur's stories about the excavations are fascinating, particularly those about the underwater dig of Fort Qait Bey, a find that uncovered details about the Pharos lighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Empereur does excel in illuminating the difficulties of uncovering a lost city that industrialization continually encroaches upon. With limited financial means and tough physical conditions, Empereur writes, ''the Alexandrian experience can also be wearisome: one has to confront various obstacles, such as the hostility of the developers who have quite other interests at heart than the enhancement of their cultural heritage.'' Today, for instance, only engravings and old maps indicate where Cleopatra's Needles, now located in London and in Central Park, once stood in Alexandria. ''People lost no time in erecting buildings in their place,'' Empereur writes. ''Do the guests of the Hotel Metropole realize, I wonder, that they are sleeping on the spot where almost two millennia ago the monumental entrance markers of the Caesareum stood?''

''Dear Sir/Madam,'' it began. ''You are being called in to evaluate your employability.'' She stuffed two doctors' letters into a worn envelope, filled a plastic bag with prescription pills and enlisted her son as an interpreter. They traveled to a drab building off Union Square, where they waited for an hour in hard plastic chairs until a caseworker summoned them to a cramped cubicle. ''The reason we called you in,'' he began, ''is everybody on public assistance is required to work.'' The son, a jobless 21-year-old, answered through a mouthful of gum: ''Well, we got letters from her doctors saying she's not really able to work.''",1998-12-20T05:00:00+0000

But Susan Isaacs has such a knack for entertaining her reader with the details of American pop culture -- from brand names and television shows to the most fashionable neuroses -- that it's easy to be distracted from the predictability of her plot. In her eighth novel, RED, WHITE AND BLUE (HarperCollins, $25), Isaacs has taken on a formidable project: to write a multigenerational family drama that is also a romantic comedy and a murder mystery and a serious consideration of weighty issues like anti-Semitism and assimilation -- all without losing her sense of humor or her eye for the entertaining detour. At the center of the novel are Charlie Blair, an F.B.I. agent from Wyoming, and Lauren Miller, a reporter for a Long Island newspaper called The Jewish News. It is clear from the start that Charlie and Lauren are lovers-to-be; they are also distant cousins, several generations removed. The story of their common ancestry, which reads like a tale of ''city mouse-country mouse'' ad-libbed by a Jewish grandmother, makes up the first half of the novel. It begins in the late 19th century with the arrival of Lauren and Charlie's great-great-grandparents on a ship in New York harbor and follows the divergent paths of the family's two halves in Wyoming and New York -- all the way up to the present. In the novel's second half, Lauren and Charlie are at last brought together after a series of it-could-only-happen-in-a-novel coincidences surrounding their investigation of Wrath, an anti-Semitic, white supremacist hate group in Wyoming. Never mind the preposterousness of this subplot. ''Red, White and Blue'' is nothing if not a delightful diversion. Nora Krug",1998-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Missing Mastroianni: Why He Meant So Much,"MARCELLO MASTROIANNI seemed to grow weary of the world long before the world grew weary of him. How else can one explain why his death in 1996 at the age of 72 was not just an irreplaceable loss to movie lovers, but seemed shockingly premature? He'd played older than he was for so long -- this existential Everyman of modern European cinema, whose career spanned five decades -- that when he finally took off the old age makeup he outwitted mortality by seeming younger than he actually was. And then, his gracefully slouching figure, a favorite alter ego for directors as disparate as Fellini and Angelopoulos, had inhabited so many valedictory films that we couldn't believe it when, in his last film, Manoel de Oliveira's ''Voyage to the Beginning of the World'' (1997), he actually said goodbye. Playing an aging director returning to the scenes of his youth, Mastroianni's face was lined, his body ravaged from the pancreatic cancer that would take his life, but he had looked much older 15 years before. In Ettore Scola's ''La Nuit de Varennes'' (1982), he was only 58 when he played the wistfully geriatric Casanova, powdered and peruked, hunched over a stick as he tried to convince women he was but a shadow, a mere representation, of his former self. As the dancer who comes out of retirement in Fellini's ''Ginger and Fred'' (1986), a robust and graceful 62-year-old Mastroianni plays a befuddled and creaky Pippo, relying on his partner (Giulietta Masina) to keep him in step till he finally topples to the floor. Back as far as 1960, as the genial gossip columnist in Fellini's star-making ''La Dolce Vita,'' he was 36 going on 65 -- a disenchanted observer of the ''scene,'' too jaded to rise to the occasional invitation to become a human being again.",1998-12-27T05:00:00+0000

Turning the common into the quirky can also earn a New York double take; an artist turns a street into a baseball diamond, and passers-by suddenly morph into Paul O'Neill rounding first even as they scurry to the A train or the analyst. But New York is so jammed that oddities happen -- like the macabre juxtaposition of a funeral home and an ad for Combat. And yes, even New Yorkers get tired of making noise and scenes. Yet when they do they still manage to keep their brass. A young man wants to share his love of Italian movies? No problem.

During the first Presidential impeachment of the 20th century, television became more than the playing field; it was an active participant, as the voracious 24-hour news channels pushed the story along. Think of how powerfully Bill Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal was molded by these endlessly replayed images: Monica Lewinsky, in her black beret, standing in a rope line to greet the President; Mr. Clinton wagging his finger at the public and saying words we now know by heart: ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' In September, for four straight hours television viewers watched the videotape of the President's testimony before the grand jury (in polls, his approval ratings rose); last week, audiences were the witnesses as the House of Representatives voted to impeach him (in polls, his approval ratings rose). We have lost count of his televised apologies. The scandal highlighted the Jekyll and Hyde nature of the 24-hour news channels: the influential CNN and MSNBC and the tag-along Fox News Channel. At their best, they offered a comprehensive yet intimate view of the Clinton Presidency in the process of unraveling; in their tackiest moments, they became the Psychic Friends Network of politics, with blather like ''What is Hillary feeling?''

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Masters of the Universe,"Infants, as the French ethnologist Alain Epelboin observes in the preface to BABIES CELEBRATED (Abrams, $39.95), are the ''tyrant-kings'' of most cultures, and some 200 color photographs in this glossy volume prove his point well. With the guidance of 16 cultural anthropologists, the authors, Beatrice Fontanel and Claire d'Harcourt, explore -- in words and in photographs collected from numerous sources -- the many ways that anxious parents around the world clothe, feed, soothe, transport, bathe and otherwise protect and placate the fussiest members of their societies. Readers will find no end of exotic traditions: diapers made of yak hair and camel dung, the smoke ''baths'' given to Australian aborigine babies, the smearing of soot and yak butter on the infant's fontanel in Tibet. Here, too, are the elaborate predecessors of the Snugli: fur-lined in Siberia, beaded in Senegal, gorgeously embroidered in Guizhou, China. The authors note that a pervading concern in these societies, as in our own, is the fragility of small children. In many parts of South America, Africa and Asia, where infant mortality is high, babies are viewed as ''vagabond souls'' who may, at any moment, wander out the door of earthly life. Hence, in Burkina Faso, Vietnam, Yemen and elsewhere, necklaces, bracelets and cords are strung around a baby's body as a means of tying the child to life. Some readers, particularly parents, may find practicality behind the symbolism -- the bright red pompoms adorning the headgear of Yao babies in Thailand, for example, may attract good fortune but also serve as effective head bumpers. Coins, beads and shells dangling from baby carriers and clothing, used to ward off evil in many cultures, provide a comforting distraction as well. Suzanne MacNeille",1998-12-27T05:00:00+0000

The Warner Brothers Studio Stores are selling ''Wizard of Oz'' merchandise, which includes a pillbox with an enamel portrait of Judy Garland as Dorothy ($10). Some fans think it is an ill-conceived souvenir, considering the singer's long battle with drugs. ''This is clearly the result of someone's making a really stupid decision,'' said John Fricke, a Judy Garland biographer. ''It's almost too tacky to have been done intentionally.'' Karine Joret, vice president for public relations at Warner's consumer products, denies any deliberate attempt to capitalize on Garland's misfortune and contends that the pillbox is a part of the company's small accessories line for women.

This is a landmark survey of a painter whose value, which remains difficult for many people to grasp, goes to the heart of what makes modern art modern. Art exhibitions don't usually have the dramatic pace of theater, but this one does. The climax comes with the big drip paintings, when the size of the gallery expands to match the scale of the pictures and the effect is a little like arriving at a precipice: as the space opens up, one has a sense of being on the edge of something amazing.

At Govinda's, a Hare Krishna-owned boutique in West Los Angeles, the seekers are local fashion and film people on a quest for gauzy shirts, long saris and other hot Hindi wear at church-basement prices: $20 for a skirt, $40 for a pashmina scarf. ''It's the new chic place where everyone goes to shop,'' said Jeanne Yang, a fashion stylist. ''There's a spiritual aspect to the clothing that appeals to people. And the soft pastels are in keeping with what designers are showing for spring.'' The incense-scented store on Venice Boulevard opened 15 years ago, but with this year's popularity of swami style, it has become a shopping destination. Sharon Stone bought white cotton separates and shawls, along with saris for upholstering her dining room chairs. Only 20 percent of the customers are affiliated with the Hare Krishnas. ''They're not necessarily into the religion,'' said Tadit Beca, the store manager (right, helping a customer). She joined the Krishna temple 26 years ago. ''I guess they feel the place has good karma.'' Sales have doubled in a year. She makes six expeditions to India a year to stock up. Kate Garner, a Los Angeles-based fashion photographer, whose work has appeared in Harpers Bazaar, W and Spin, bought a gray skirt, meant to be worn under a sari. ''It has a drawstring and a little frill along the bottom,'' she said. ''It looks like it could be Helmut Lang because of the color. And it was only $20.

His gym was described in Business Week and Forbes. He was profiled in The Wall Street Journal. Jake and his two 31-year-old partners -- Paul Kuebler, a former Arthur Andersen accountant from California, and Vladimir Grumlik, a Russian fitness enthusiast and entrepreneur -- had raised enough money from private investors to fill the hangar-size arena with an army of Stairmasters and treadmills, as well as massage rooms, saunas, solaria and a beauty salon. Two bars poured cappuccinos and bodybuilding drinks, a cafe served burritos and chicken-breast salads and past the aerobics studio and squash area were tennis courts of imitation grass and a basketball floor built by Nike. At the grand-opening ceremonies, nearly 2,000 members and sightseers ogled the pec decks and bench presses, egged on by live Russian rock bands, Moscow Circus acts and an exhibition of dunks and three-pointers by the former Red Army basketball team.

us,Restless,"It's around 2 o'clock on Halloween morning, four hours outside of Cleveland on Interstate 80, and Sean Penn, who is behind the wheel of a rented Olds 88, is saying what he has been saying for days, weeks, years. ''This is it,'' he says. ''I'm not going to act in movies again.'' In Hollywood, which is the place where he has said this the most, it is understood less as an announcement of a retirement he never quite sticks to than as a frequently repeated existential declaration of his unhappiness with the movie business and the films it makes now. Jack Nicholson, a close friend of Penn's, says: ''He won't quit. But let him whirl around, saying he's quitting. Sean is brilliant, but, of course, we know that's no solace for anybody.'' Warren Beatty, another close friend, says: ''He's not going to give up acting. What Sean means is that he would like to give up the thought of making the brand of picture that opens big on a Friday night.'' Many in Hollywood also understand that Penn -- who, for all his world-weariness, is only 38 -- may be the best actor of his generation, and also the most influential, a role model for the likes of Matt Damon and Edward Norton. And for all his talk of quitting he has been very busy this year, with roles in two new movies -- ''Hurlyburly,'' a dark drama about the male psyche, based on a play by David Rabe, and ''The Thin Red Line,'' the much-heralded return of the director Terrence Malick, whose last movie was ''Days of Heaven,'' in 1978. Penn is also starring in a Woody Allen movie now being completed in and around New York, a period piece in which Penn plays a jazz guitarist. Penn, who has never played the guitar, learned the fingering for 30 songs in two months. ''I have these nightmares,'' he says, lighting an American Spirit cigarette somewhere in Pennsylvania in the middle of the night.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Strains of Occupation,"First published in France in 1986 as ''Le Pierrot Noir,'' Roger Grenier's spare and elegant novel, ANOTHER NOVEMBER (University of Nebraska, cloth, $40; paper, $12 ), is a meditation on personal and political loyalties. The unnamed narrator reminisces about Pau, in southwestern France, where he and his friends grew up at the time of the Spanish Civil War. When World War II comes to France, the stresses of the Occupation bring out the essential characteristics of each individual, particularly those of Charles Merlin, the richest boy in town and the most spoiled. Charles's collaboration with the Nazis is not so much an ethical collapse as a confirmation that morals are as nothing to him when measured against his personal comfort. In contrast, the narrator performs admirably in the Resistance (as did Grenier in real life), but his heroism is related in an offhand manner, as if it were not a choice but something inevitable -- ''It wasn't much.'' Seamlessly translated by Alice Kaplan, the novel is built around the recurring image of a carousel at the St. Martin's fair, which comes to town every November. Among its other attractions are a Pierrot figure who wears black silk instead of the star-struck lover's lunar white and, conversely, a boat ride with gondolas that are painted white rather than the jet black of the Venetian originals. These devices suggest that life is not what it seems; yet the melancholy tone of ''Another November'' appears to exist not because a thing can prove to be its opposite but because in the end there are no surprises.
