He abolished direct elections for governors in 2004, during his second term as president, but President Dmitri A. Medvedev pushed a law through Parliament last year to restore them in what was seen as a major concession to a growing political opposition movement. Mr. Putin, now serving his third term as president, has said that the new law is needed to protect minorities in regions where elections could be combustible. Critics said the law would allow the pro-Kremlin United Russia Party to avoid election defeats by using its control of regional legislatures to bypass popular voting.

For all of the Grassos, the very idea of the trip stirs up thoughts of old losses, ghosts that shadow the present, prompted by the dissonant fact that like many if not most Italian-Americans, Antonio and Maddalena Grasso enshrined in their children a glowing image of things Italian yet never took them to Italy or even taught them the language.

us,. . . Congress Disposes,"Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed the overwhelming support of American Jews during his presidency, and the reasons are clear. In his three-plus terms from 1933 to 1945, he led the war against Hitler, supported a Jewish homeland in Palestine, appointed a Jew to the Supreme Court, chose another to be his secretary of the Treasury and surrounded himself with Jewish advisers who helped shape the laws that revolutionized the role of government in American life  what some critics sneeringly called the Jew Deal. Then, of course, there was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose concern for minorities fused the bond even tighter. When Roosevelt died in 1945, the Rabbinical Assembly of America described him, almost supernaturally, as an immortal leader of humanity and a peerless servant of God.",2013-04-05T14:20:05+0000
us,Up Front,"In his review of Monte Reels Between Man and Beast this week, David Quammen notes that part of what made the discovery of gorillas so sensational in the Victorian era was that they were too similar to humans for comfort. As for whether attitudes have changed much, Quammen  the author of a biography of Charles Darwin, among other books  isnt so sure; in an e-mail, he cited a recent Gallup poll that found 46 percent of Americans decline to accept the reality that humans have evolved from ancestral primates. His most recent book, Spillover, is about human diseases that come to us from animals, and he arrives at the terrifying conclusion that such outbreaks are likely to become more frequent and more worrisome. The next big one might well prove devastating, he said. Still, if there is one salubrious thing about these insalubrious afflictions, such as Ebola and West Nile and AIDS and the influenzas, its that they remind us, by spilling over from nonhuman animals to humans, that we humans are just another animal.",2013-04-05T14:20:56+0000

Even his ending was vintage Chvez. The perpetual showman spent the last months of his life ruling Venezuela Oz-like, by remote control from his sickbed (he even missed his own inauguration on Jan. 10). All of which makes this the perfect time for the release of Rory Carrolls Comandante: Hugo Chvezs Venezuela, a sort of political obituary for the self-declared savior of Venezuela  a charismatic champion of the poor who, during his 14 years in office, ground one of Latin Americas richest states into the dust.",2013-04-05T14:22:30+0000

Grandeur was his nature. He aroused adulation. He dealt a few preliminary military defeats to the Spanish imperial army, and in 1813, he entered victoriously, for the moment, into Caracas on a chariot drawn by white-gowned daughters of the leading families, as if he were a god or a Caesar. And he assumed the magnificent title of Liberator and Dictator. The chariot and the daughters deviated, it is true, from the austere Washington style, and the dictatorial honorific has hovered a little ominously over his reputation ever since, as you can see by reading Marie Aranas admiring and rueful biography, Bolvar.",2013-04-05T14:22:46+0000

My own case dates to my mid-20s, when I discovered Peter Nadass novel A Book of Memories. Its high-Modernist aspirations were just one of the ways this contemporary masterpiece seemed to issue from a more distinguished past. Fascinated, I began reading every living Hungarian novelist I could find in English: Imre Kertesz, Laszlo Krasznahorkai. . . .

us,Vain Glorious | Olfactive Studio,"Images and perfumes have always been linked, says Cline Verleure, a 20-year fragrance industry veteran based in Paris. When we smell a perfume, it gives us images in our heads, like a landscape or a scene. A few years ago, she decided to explore this relationship further by asking perfumers to collaborate with photographers on a series of eau de parfums inspired by the visual artists works. Thus, Olfactive Studio was born, and the French brands five highly concentrated unisex scents arrive in the United States on April 8. The perfumers are able to create on a spiritual level. Olivier Cresp, who worked on the Flash Back fragrance with the photographer Laurent Segretier, says theres a new and special freedom in starting with the visual, Verleure notes. Her current favorite in the lineup is Lumire Blanche, a milky yet fresh and spicy concoction from the perfumer Sidonie Lancesseur, who drew her inspiration from the famed photographer Massimo Vitalis picture of sunbathers gathered on the ivory-hued Scala dei Turchi cliff in southern Sicily. To fully experience the connection between the visual and olfactory elements, Verleure suggests first choosing a scent based on the image, which adorns the fragrance box, and then smelling the juice second. Pick the photo that gives you the most emotion, and you will really like that perfume. It works! she says.",2013-04-05T18:00:55+0000

The collection, which will be on view April 9 and 10 at Pradas exhibition space at Via Fogazzaro 36, consists of pieces that address the increasingly blurred boundaries between working and living space by being kinetic rather than static. As Koolhaas said, his goal was to create furniture that performs in very precise but also in completely unpredictable ways and indeed, flexibility is the key here. A massive, heavily engineered piece called the 04 Counter consists of three horizontal bars that stack like a wall, but which can also pivot and cantilever, transforming the piece from room divider to piazza, as Benjamin Pardo, Knolls design director, called it, adding, Once people discover that the object moves, they want to engage with it.",2013-04-05T19:00:47+0000

(Cinemax) DARK SHADOWS (2012) Johnny Depp, above, summons the spirit of the romantic vampire hero Barnabas Collins in Tim Burtons revisiting of a 1960s daytime soap opera. Eva Green plays the maid Angelique, who paws at Barnabass body. Bella Heathcote is Josette, who runs off with his heart. Threes a crowd, and the witchy Angelique casts a spell that leaves Josette dead and Barnabas bereft  and leads to a timeout in a deep grave, where, after 200 years of entombment, he awakes in 1972, like a thirstier Rip Van Winkle. Barnabass liberation does the same for Mr. Depps performance, and its delightful to watch how the actor handles the vampires readjustment to the world of the living, which, after he has thrown back some invigorating human Slurpees and faced down a demon (a car), he does with both lofty entitlement and abject bewilderment, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Dark Shadows isnt among Mr. Burtons most richly realized works, but its very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent, she added. And while there may not be any deeper resonance lurking in his Dark Shadows  the show first surfaced in the middle of the Vietnam War, when real horror was playing out daily in the news  Mr. Burtons gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power.",2013-04-06T05:00:12+0000

His spot paintings, which he began in 1986, have particularly been lightning rods. These panels of bright-hued spots are usually arranged in columns on canvases of different shapes, and his fans have paid as much as $3.4 million for them. Last year the Gagosian Gallery mounted an exhibition, The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011, at 11 galleries in eight cities. But the shows expansive title notwithstanding, it presented only 331 works  a fraction of the spot-painting output of Mr. Hirst. The full scope of Mr. Hirsts fascination with colored dots will become clear this spring, when his publisher, Other Criteria, issues a comprehensive catalog of the paintings: a 1,000-page illustrated book listing every work. Jason Beard, the director of Other Criteria, told The Art Newspaper that there are about 1,400 of the works. Mr. Hirst painted the first 25 himself; the others have been mainly entrusted to his assistants.

The Havana Times reported that the couple also visited a dance troupe, Danza Contempornea de Cuba, the singer Haila Mompi and the childrens theater group La Colmenita, and met with students and teachers at the Superior Art Institute. They may soon be explaining the trip to members of Congress, or facing a prison sentence and a fine. Treasury Department regulations prohibit Americans from traveling to Cuba unless authorized by a general or specific license. Now two Republican members of the House of Representatives from Florida  which has a large population of Cuban refugees and where feelings about Cuba are acute  have raised questions about the visit. The representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, have written to Adam J. Szubin, the director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department, asking about the nature of the license the couple received for their visit. Cubas tourism industry is wholly state-controlled, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Diaz-Balart wrote, therefore, U.S. dollars spent on Cuban tourism directly fund the machinery of oppression that brutally represses the Cuban people. Penalties for violating the travel ban can include a 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.

They knew she had earned the right to face the country in an election one last time, rather than be deposed by the supposed lieutenants in her own party. They sensed there would be some Shakespearean retribution for the act of disloyalty they were engaged in.

The plot this time concerns a young journalist and his girlfriend, a graduate student, who have been investigating a sex-trafficking ring with patrons high up the political chain. It is Ms. Rapaces fierce and sly performance, more than the themes or the plot, that sustains The Girl Who Played With Fire, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Without her, it would be a not bad procedural, touching on some knotty contemporary issues and infused with a paranoia that is at once unsettling and comforting. But, he added, Ms. Rapace, tiny and agile, her steely rage showing now and then the tiniest crack of vulnerability, belongs to another dimension altogether.

Jean-Franois Mercier (David Tennant, foreground above), a French military attach in Warsaw, goes undercover in Czechoslovakia as he searches for the man who can lead him into the Nazi war machine. Anna Skarbek (Janet Montgomery), his mistress and a lawyer for the League of Nations, receives devastating news about her former lover, the Russian journalist Maxim Mostov (Piotr Baumann), and flees to Spain on a mission of mercy. The drama has an almost comic-book adherence to stereotype, from the dashing Polish nobleman to the sallow, pockmarked Nazi border guard, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. On the other hand, there is nothing more satisfying than a prewar espionage story that shows, up close and told-you-so, how most of Europe slept through Hitlers rise. She added, There are many impediments to true love in Spies of Warsaw, but Mercier, solitary and sorrowful, learns to trust his heart  and not the Maginot Line. ",2013-04-10T05:00:13+0000

They were both giddy, kvelling with baby-pride, especially Weiner, who, with all his free time, has become his sons primary caretaker. This is what life is like now for the man whose name is invariably followed in print by some version of the disgraced former congressman who sent out a lewd picture of himself via Twitter. He seems to spend much of his time within a five-block radius of his apartment: going to the park with Jordan; picking up his wifes dry cleaning and doing the grocery shopping; eating at his brother Jasons two restaurants in the neighborhood. This is what happens after a scandal: Ranks are closed and the world shrinks to a tiny dot. It is a life in retreat. And for a man who was known, pre-scandal, for his overweening ambition, his constant presence on cable news, his hard-charging schedule that verged on lunacy, well, it has been quite a change.",2013-04-10T09:00:14+0000

Instead of ink, each stamp has a unique dot pattern that triggers an artistic effect when placed against the iPads screen. Want to add a swimming dolphin? Use the sticker stamp. Want to make your dolphin move? Use the Arrow stamp, and trace a course. After you snap your iPad into the holder and download the free app, called ArtSee Studio, your child is free to sketch. One weak point  our testers found it hard to undo a sticker once it has been placed. But they were impressed by the powerful drawing options, which include such wonders as a rainbow crayon.

(Sundance) ADAPTATION (2002) The director Spike Jonze and the writer Charlie Kaufman (along with his imaginary twin, Donald, who is also credited with writing the screenplay) journey into metafiction in this movie about the two Kaufmans (Nicolas Cage, in both roles) and Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep), a writer for The New Yorker whose book The Orchid Thief inspired the film. Chris Cooper won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role as an orchid obsessive; Ms. Streep and Mr. Cage (above) also received Oscar nominations. Adaptation is, most obviously, a movie about itself, as gleefully self-referential an exercise in auto-deconstruction as you could wish, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But it is also, more deeply, a movie about its own nonexistence  a narrative that confronts both the impossibility and the desperate necessity of storytelling, and that short-circuits our expectations of coherence, plausibility and fidelity to lived reality even as it satisfies them. Common sense suggests that there could never be such a movie, but if there could, it would have to be one of the slipperiest, most fascinating and, by any sane reckoning, best movies of the year.",2013-04-12T05:00:10+0000

Prime Minister Hun Sen called the Sky Bridge Project a great achievement and proclaimed that it would end traffic problems in the area.It wasnt long before commuters discovered a catch: By making it easier for motorists traveling north-south to keep going straight, the new overpass made it impossible for them to turn left onto the intersecting east-west road. The result is a mess. Now, drivers heading south who want to cross the river must first take a right and drive away for several hundred meters and then make a U-turn and head back. And motorists heading north are forced to turn right, which necessarily takes them onto the bridges  meaning that they are forced to cross the river, turn around and cross the river again. Congestion in the area is worse than ever, and the traffic more dangerous.",2013-04-12T12:34:25+0000

Hazel Bishop  a biochemist with a background in petroleum science  set out to solve this problem. Using the tiny kitchen of her Central Park West apartment as a lab, she cooked potions in a double boiler and compounded dyes on a countertop.

Lipstick had existed for centuries, of course, but Bishop hoped to create a long-lasting version for the modern woman, one that would stand up to the friction of coffee cups, cigarettes and kisses. She hit on a formula made with lanolin and dyes that penetrated deep into the skin. To demonstrate its sticking power, she persuaded her neighborhood druggist to decorate his hand with streaks of her lipstick.

This week, Volume 5 of American Vampire, about a new breed of bloodsucker, enters the list at No. 2. (He is also the writer behind the Batman stories at No. 1 and No. 8.) In this latest installment of American Vampire, Mr. Snyder has been blessed with two gifted collaborators: Rafael Albuquerque, the original series artist, and Dustin Nguyen, who illustrates a spin-off story included in this collection. Though vampires have seemingly given up their number one status in pop culture to zombies, Mr. Snyder proves there are still plenty of tales to tell about these creatures of the night. Mr. Nguyen lends his wonderfully expressive and moody art to an adventure involving the hunt for the granddaddy of all vampires, Dracula, while Mr. Albuquerque illustrates the exploration of all things related to Skinner Sweet, the first American vampire, who is more vicious and less bothered by sunlight. The only drawback to reading this book in collected form is that the reader does not get to long savor the cliffhangers with which Mr. Snyder ends most issues.

Here they show us a more real, and even exaggerated side of Moores natural beauty. Freckled from birth (and not in a cute way, she explains in the piece), Moores face was sprinkled by Philips with even more spots.

us,Indonesia: Flag Dispute Put Off," The Indonesian government has extended by 60 days a deadline for the government in Aceh Province to annul a new bylaw that declares the banner of a former armed separatist movement to be the provinces official flag and seal, a Ministry of Home Affairs official said Monday. Zaini Abdullah, the governor of Aceh, had faced a Tuesday deadline to strike down the bylaw, which was passed by the provincial legislature last month. The dispute centers on the outlawed flag of the Free Aceh Movement, now defunct, which signed a peace agreement with the Indonesian government in 2005 that ended a 29-year civil war. The national government and armed forces oppose the use of the banner, citing multiple national laws against separatism. Officials in Aceh say the peace agreement and the provinces special autonomy status allow it to have its own flag and seal. ",2013-04-16T02:28:57+0000

Mr. Ahmadinejad, left, is also visiting Benin and Ghana. Irans state-run media did not specify the purpose of the trip beyond a desire to advance relations with all three countries. But the stop in Niger aroused speculation that Iran, which is under international sanctions over its disputed nuclear program, might be looking for outside sources of uranium, despite its claims of self-sufficiency. Last week Iran said it had opened two new uranium mines, suggesting that its supply is running low. According to the World Nuclear Association, a London-based trade group representing the nuclear profession, Niger is the worlds fourth-biggest uranium producer. Most of it goes by contract to Areva, a mining company based in France, the former colonial power in Niger. ",2013-04-16T02:42:57+0000

(13, 49) THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE (2012) The directors Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns revisit the case of the Central Park jogger, a 28-year-old white woman who was found in the park very early on April 20, 1989, bound, gagged, nearly naked and nearly dead, and the five black and Latino teenagers who were arrested (above, Yusef Salaam, one of the accused). They argue that the convictions, and the years the defendants served for the attack, of which they were eventually absolved last year, constituted a second, racially motivated crime. Equal measures criminal investigation, cultural exhumation and a consideration of race in a presumptively postracial America, it seeks to set the record straight, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Measured in tone and outraged in its argument, it is an emotionally stirring, at times crushingly depressing cinematic call to witness. Its also frustrating because while it re-examines the assault on the jogger and painstakingly walks you through what happened to the teenagers  from their arrest through their absolution  it fails to add anything substantively new. If you followed the news, the story will be familiar; if you lived in New York in 1989, it may also feel incomplete.",2013-04-16T05:00:09+0000

us,Florida: Teachers Sue Over Evaluation System," Seven Florida teachers have brought a federal lawsuit to protest job evaluation policies that tether individual performance ratings to the test scores of students who are not even in their classes. The suit, which was filed Tuesday in conjunction with three local affiliates of the National Education Association in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Gainesville, says Floridas two-year-old evaluation system violates teachers rights of due process and equal protection. Under a 2011 law, schools and districts must evaluate teachers in part based on how much their students learn, as measured by standardized tests. But since Florida, like most states, administers only math and reading tests and only in selected grades, many teachers do not teach tested subjects. One of the plaintiffs, a first-grade teacher, was rated on the basis of test scores of students in a different school in her district, and another, who teaches vocational classes to aspiring health care workers, was rated based on test scores of students in grades and subjects she had never taught. This lawsuit highlights the absurdity of the current evaluation system, said Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association. ",2013-04-17T04:47:58+0000

As the name implies, there are elements taken from traditional spinning  fat-blasting and calorie-burning moves, upbeat soundtracks, and friendly (but firm) instructors  but there are also benefits that only exercising in water can boast. For starters, theres the draw of a low-impact, high-resistance workout. The water supports your body weight and reduces stress on joints while generating resistance, which encourages your legs to move in a safe and controlled manner. Devotees also claim that aqua spinning can help smooth dimpled thighs. Aqua Studios founder Esther Gauthier, a French expat, says, Moving in water generates a natural massage that drains the lymphatic system and improves the appearance of cellulite. But most important, being in the water is simply fun. Theres something about throwing on a bathing suit and splashing in water that takes the typical emotional edge off of exercising: your muscles are getting a serious workout, while your mind feels buoyant and light. After my first session, I felt rejuvenated and energized, not wiped out (like I do after an intense run), and left the studio with a spring in my step.

The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces decided 3 to 2 that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, filed by a coalition of journalists and organizations, including the Center for Constitutional Rights, which said in a statement that the ruling meant that Private Mannings trial, set for June 3, will be fundamentally unfair. Military officials initially withheld from the public all documents in the case, including some the judge read aloud in court. More recently, officials have released a selection of documents, but with names and other information blacked out. ",2013-04-18T00:29:19+0000

us,Vindication,"Margaret Fuller died on July 19, 1850, in a shipwreck off Fire Island. In her intellectual prime and at the height of her influence as a social reformer, she was returning home from Europe with her Italian husband and their child. A major advocate for the rights of women, Fuller had left the United States in 1846, just a year after the publication of her influential book, Woman in the Nineteenth Century, which both Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton cited as an inspiration. Having accomplished her mission, as Megan Marshall puts it in this new biography, to meet the writers and radicals whose work shed admired from afar and test their minds in conversation, Fuller was coming home to the United States, having flagrantly acted out the freedoms she demanded as every womans right.",2013-04-19T14:32:25+0000
us,The Lost Novelist,"Charles Jackson, one of the most successful failures in American letters, wished as fiercely as any writer for literary immortality. This he was denied, though for a brief moment in the mid-1940s it seemed all but certain. His first novel, The Lost Weekend, sold nearly half a million copies within five years of its publication, was translated into 14 languages, inspired a hit film that swept the 1945 Academy Awards, and helped cause a major shift in public perceptions about alcoholism. After this taste of fame, Jacksons career tumbled into a long decline, made more agonizing by periodic relapses of hope. Even before he died, in 1968, his reputation had blurred into obscurity. Today, except for vague memories of his connection to the classic movie, it has all but disappeared.",2013-04-19T14:33:31+0000
us,"This Could Be Heaven, or This Could Be Hell","The perfect translation of Dantes Divine Comedy remains one of literatures holiest grails. Some translators have captured facets of the poems magic, but always at a cost: Charles Singleton conveys Dantes erudition but flattens his poetry; John Ciardi recreates his music but takes mammoth liberties with the original; and John Sinclairs thees and thous date his otherwise deft rendering. If the translators task is to liberate the language imprisoned in a work, as Walter Benjamin writes, then few literary strongholds come as heavily fortified as The Divine Comedy. Written in Dantes native Tuscan instead of the more prestigious Latin, the poem and its earthy idiom, copious allusions and otherworldy precision burden translators, especially in rhyme-poor English, which struggles to match the momentum of Dantes terza rima and internal rhymes. No wonder that Dantes latest translator, the eminent Australian poet and critic Clive James, feared his task would be thankless.",2013-04-19T14:33:33+0000

It had neither the nothing-left-to-lose freedom of the 70s nor the everything-to-gain hedonism of the aughts. History will record it as a neutered, amorphous interregnum. But I can attest to the fact that the East Village was a good place to live then, filled with coffee shops, secondhand stores, Kims Video and lots of seedy bars. It still felt like downtown, and for a kid raised in the suburb known as the Upper East Side, there was nothing more I wanted from a neighborhood. One of my favorite places was a rock club called Brownies, on Avenue A, and that was largely because of a single night in 1996 that kind of represents the whole decade for me.",2013-04-19T14:34:06+0000

In the 1920s, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald careered through New York City and Great Neck, Paris and the South of France, leaving in their wake a trail of splintered Champagne glasses and glittering bons mots. Their tragic, slow-motion falls  she to madness and a series of mental institutions, he to alcohol and an indifferent public  seemed inevitable, and drawn from the pages of one of his novels.

us,Other Labyrinths,"Anne Carson has a history of doing unpredictable and genre-crossing things. A classical scholar who came late to poetry, she rose, in the 90s and 00s, quickly and deservedly, to prominence. Many readers (including me) first knew her through The Glass Essay, a 38-page multipart lyric narrative in 1995s Glass, Irony and God. The poem is an inspired mash-up: a confessional-style I recounts a breakup with a lover and a visit to an aged mother while considering the life and writings of Emily Bront and reporting on her surrealist visions of nudes. The yoking of disparates, the old and the new, continues to be a Carson strategy. Shes generally claimed by the poetry world, but her books often contain swaths of lyric, critical or essayistic prose, as well as translation, dramatic dialogue and visual art. Many toil in the interstices of genre; Carsons palatable, popular, sophisticated and who-cares approach may have done the most and best work in the last two decades to stop people worrying so much about whats poetry and whats not. At her best, shes among our most exciting poets. At her less-than-best shes reliably ingenious, full of charisma and surprise.

The highlight of the trip was a one-week tour of Myanmar, then almost completely cut off from the outside world. Three decades later, Jet Skiers and beach resorts have taken over my Thai island, and busloads of day-trippers flock to those Nepalese villages on a newly built trans-Himalayan highway.

Since 2004, he has also been the guiding hand of the Avengers, and has pushed that team of heroes, which includes Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, to new heights of popularity. In fact, the Avengers started to outshine the X-Men, who had previously been Marvels top franchise. All New X-Men, which collects the first five issues of the new series, is wonderfully entertaining. Time-travel stories are old hat, but Mr. Bendis manages to squeeze some delight out of this one. The original X-Men have traveled from the past to the present and are alarmed by what they see: one of them has betrayed their founder, Charles Xavier; one of them has evolved beyond recognition; another of them is dead. Though it may cause problems with the space-time continuum, the younger team opts to stay in the present, hoping to right some wrongs.

Her release after 18 months of detention followed an appeal to Mexicos Supreme Court challenging the terms of her arrest.

No surprise then that some of his first participants were composers: this is a constant aspiration. Composers have a reputation for working methods that include long sessions alone in their workplace with intense focus on their work, occasionally  indeed, arguably ideally  eventually losing a sense of time. I was attracted to this idea and felt a kinship, less to my working method but more in the way I thought and organized my music.

(Cinemax) SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD (2012) As global calamity looms, Dodge (Steve Carell), a nebbishy New York insurance salesman whose wife has fled, embarks on a road trip with the girl next door (Keira Knightley, above with Mr. Carell) to find his long-lost high school love in this comedy directed by Lorene Scafaria. Connie Britton, Rob Corddry and Patton Oswalt round out the cast as Dodges friends, who encourage him to react to imminent doom the way they would: by throwing off all inhibitions. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film a sweet, whimsical and seriously misguided romp through end times, which goes very gentle into that good night. The problem is not that Ms. Scafaria takes her grave subject too lightly, he said. Laughter is an entirely appropriate response to something so abstractly awful as an unstoppable meteor speeding toward earth. But, he added, it seems downright unfair that billions of people have to die so that a middle-aged sad sack can cop a cuddle with a cute, younger bohemian neighbor.",2013-04-20T05:00:10+0000

(13, 49) THE BLETCHLEY CIRCLE Nine years after putting their extraordinary talents to use at Bletchley Park, Britains code-breaking headquarters during World War II, four seemingly ordinary women piece together clues they hope will solve a series of murders. Leading the charge is Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin, above), now a homemaker and mother of two, who wangles her way into Scotland Yard when she thinks she has detected a pattern to the killings. But when the police dismiss her theory, she turns for assistance to her former colleagues  Millie (Rachael Stirling), conversant in 14 languages and good with maps; Lucy (Sophie Rundle), with her photographic memory; and Jean (Julie Graham), their onetime supervisor  who, like Susan, have returned to civilian life and kept their intelligence work secret from even those closest to them. While the solving of the mystery is fairly conventional, these amateur detectives arent, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The three-part mystery doesnt have a preachy tone, but it does have a message, and its similar to the one in Call the Midwife, the British series, leading in at 8, that follows young nurses who after the war helped women in the poorest sections of London deliver babies, usually in tenement homes, on top of rags and newspapers, she said, adding that both series find a clever, entertaining way to pay tribute to women who in their time were often overlooked and underestimated, and nevertheless found ways to never be ordinary.",2013-04-21T15:44:55+0000

(13) THE ISLAND PRESIDENT (2012) The director Jon Shenk visits the Maldives, an archipelago of about 1,200 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, and follows the efforts of Mohamed Nasheed, above, the countrys president from 2009 to 2012, as he tries to save the nation, a haven for wealthy tourists, from being swallowed by rising seas thought to be caused by global warming. It is in the nature of political leaders, especially in democracies, to be optimistic, to insist that solutions can be found to even the most intractable problems, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Topical, politically engaged documentaries, particularly those made by American filmmakers, share in this tendency, offering implicit reassurance even as they deliver bad news about the state of the world. Mr. Shenks film, presented here by Independent Lens, is buoyant and spirited enough to keep those demons temporarily at bay, Mr. Scott added.

us,Now Showing | Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion,"Peacocking, the preening of fastidiously dressed males of the fashion flock, has been exhaustively documented of late by international street fashion photographers who track willing prey in their natural habitats: outside fashion shows, fabulous parties and glitzy store openings where the rare birds tend to gather. The origin of this dandy species, Beau Brummel (1778-1840), and his fanciful progeny are the subject of the exhibition Artist/Rebel/Dandy: Men of Fashion at the Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design, opening April 28. The curators, Kate Irvin and Laurie Brewer, from the schools department of costume and textiles, have capitalized on this recent surge of interest in the artistry and craftsmanship of mens wear with their study of clothing and ephemera honoring the aesthetic provocateur. Aided by an archive that includes the personal wardrobe of Richard Merkin, a legendary RISD professor, painter and dandy-in-residence, the curators constructed a thematic, rather than chronological, exploration into what they term the always provocative dandy stance. Delving deeper than the decorative surface, they contrast the social subversion of dandy revolutionaries, who express political views through their personal wardrobes, with a dandy historians appreciation of tailoring tradition, while a connoisseur prides self-expression over societal conformity. Thom Browne says in the accompanying catalogs preface that Rebellion comes from being perfectly comfortable doing my own thing and having the drive to make challenging statements in mens wear. According to the curators, by kicking at the boundaries of taste, the dandy is indeed much more than the commonly criticized superficial person devoted only to the outer shell.",2013-04-22T17:45:39+0000

Actually, it was ridiculous after you witnessed it too, but that was the point. The reason it worked, among other things, was that their songs were surprisingly great, and the band could fill a room with an energy that inspired villainy. The altercation I wrote about at a 1996 show at Brownies in the East Village was apparently not uncommon. We had a lot of extremes, people who loved the humor, and then a lot of people who got out of control, Widmer says. It seemed to make people go crazy.

The decision was a victory for the agency, which in 2011 retroactively vetoed a permit granted by the Bush administration in 2007 to allow a subsidiary of Arch Coal of St. Louis to dump tons of mining waste into several West Virginia rivers and streams. The veto was declared illegal in a 2012 decision by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of Federal District Court, who called it an illegal power grab. But on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the Clean Water Act and Congressional intent gave E.P.A. the authority to retroactively revoke a mining permit. The ruling affects a proposed mine known as Spruce No. 1, which would have involved dynamiting the tops off mountains to get at coal. Kim Link, a spokeswoman for Arch Coal, said in an e-mail: Were disappointed in the decision, which was related to the procedural aspects of the proceeding.

From May 3 to 5, she will fill the 2,500-square-foot space at 1440 Third Avenue with pillows, rugs, rolls of fabric to be sold by the yard, clothing, handbags, totes, napkins and furniture. Products will be sold at 40 to 70 percent off retail. Eighteen-inch-square pillows, shown above and below, originally $350 to $575, will be $179 to $299. Home delivery is not available, but even rugs and furniture pieces will be small enough to carry. The sale will take place from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Information: (212) 535-1250.",2013-04-24T22:11:40+0000

Founded in 1582 by the Spanish commander Hernando de Lerma, the city has traditionally served primarily as a supply center for the Spanish mining sites located in present-day Bolivia. A concerted effort to encourage new hotels, restaurants and shops is now paying off in a stream of visitors attracted to Saltas updated colonial charm. Today, the old city center is recognized as a jewel-box-size getaway, perfect for exploring on foot and finally appreciated for its rich cultural offerings, grand neo-Classical buildings and thriving night life.",2013-04-25T20:30:39+0000

us,Wheres the Baby?,"In 1991, Kathryn Harrison published Thicker Than Water, a novel about a young woman struggling to come to terms with the sexual relationship shed had with her father. Three books later, she published The Kiss, a memoir in which she examined, in excruciating detail, the sexual relationship shed had with her father. In reading both of these impressive books, the line between novel and memoir unavoidably blurs. More recently, the gifted Canadian author Sheila Heti wrote How Should a Person Be  a novel, as its subtitle proclaims, from life. Sheila is the protagonist, surrounded by friends with the same names and occupations as those in her life off the page. This is a relatively extreme case in autobiographical fiction, more experimental than confessional, in which the niceties of inventing characters are dispensed with entirely. Its an intriguing and sometimes unsettling decision, resulting in a sort of hybrid: not quite fiction, not quite memoir. Sitcoms have used this device for years, with stars from Ozzie and Harriet Nelson to Louis C. K. creating irreverent alternative realities modeled closely on their lives. ",2013-04-25T21:14:41+0000

The prison has 56 detainees from Yemen who were approved for transfer more than three years ago. But President Obama halted any further transfers after the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner by a Yemeni-based branch of Al Qaeda on Dec. 25, 2009. In a letter to Mr. Obamas national security director, Tom Donilon, Ms. Feinstein said it was time to examine whether Yemens president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has been a strong foe of Al Qaeda since taking office last year, could provide adequate security assurances to return the inmates.

The trial, known as HVTN 505, started in 2009 with 2,504 gay male volunteers in 19 cities who got three shots over eight weeks. A recent analysis by an outside monitoring board found that more volunteers who got the vaccine became infected during a follow-up period than volunteers who got a placebo. However, the numbers of men infected  27 vaccine recipients versus 21 placebo recipients  were statistically too close to say that the test vaccine had actually increased the chances of infection, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsored the trial. Those who got the vaccine and became infected anyway also did not have less virus in their blood, the monitoring board found. The vaccine was based on an adenovirus, which causes common colds. In 2007, another trial of an adenovirus-based vaccine was halted because it was not working, and later analysis suggested that for some men  those who had previously caught adenovirus colds  the vaccine made it more likely, rather than less, that they would get infected with H.I.V.

(13, 49) RODGERS & HAMMERSTEINS CAROUSEL The Broadway baby Kelli OHara and the opera singer Nathan Gunn, above with Ms. OHara, star in this semistaged New York Philharmonic production of the musical about an ill-fated romance between a carousel barker and a millworker in coastal Maine, featuring classics like If I Loved You, June Is Bustin Out All Over and Youll Never Walk Alone. Stephanie Blythe, Shuler Hensley, Jason Danieley, Jessie Mueller, Kate Burton and John Cullum round out the cast of this Live From Lincoln Center presentation, directed by John Rando and conducted by Rob Fisher. The New York City Ballet principals Robert Fairchild and Tiler Peck perform the pas de deux in Act II. Theres a sly fitness to the pairing of Ms. OHara and Mr. Gunn, Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times. You might say these gifted singers come from different worlds, just as do their characters, Julie Jordan and Billy Bigelow. He added: Happily, and perhaps obviously, things work out better for Ms. OHara and Mr. Gunn than they do for the loving but trouble-plagued characters they portray. Things come out pretty swell for the audience too: from top to bottom this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.",2013-04-26T05:00:10+0000

(Sundance) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet, scholarly young man, and Brad Pitt (above right, with Mr. Sheffer) is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother, in this adaptation of Mr. Macleans 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister (Tom Skerritt) coming of age in western Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression  and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Between the novellas well-known first sentence (In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing) and its elegiac last line (I am haunted by waters), A River Runs Through It circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Macleans early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories. She added: Its easy to recognize Robert Redfords reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love. While the film is more lavish than Mr. Macleans story, and hence less commandingly precise, it radiates much the same seriousness of purpose. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean  of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace  are ably reflected on the screen.",2013-04-27T05:00:09+0000

Last week NBC announced it was renewing five drama series, including two, Revolution and Chicago Fire, that the network introduced this season. Grimm, arguably the networks most reliable drama, was another show that was renewed; it holds up Friday night for the network and has experienced a ratings increase of 14 percent this season. The ratings for Law & Order Special Victims Unit have descended to just about survival level, but that show will return in a move that has been a ritual for the network for 15 years. Parenthood, the well-regarded family drama that performed well this year (up 8 percent), had been truncated to only 15 episodes, a sign that the network did not have the most faith in its endurance before this season started. That was also a sign that cost was a factor in considering its fate: Parenthood has a big budget and an enormous cast, with several star-name actors, including Lauren Graham, Peter Krause and Dax Shepard. A renewal order had been in some doubt until last week because of those budget concerns, but NBC announced that Parenthood would be back and with a full order of 22 episodes. The NBC announcement didnt stop President Obama from taking a little shot at the networks prime-time woes at the White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday night. Joking about his recent performance at a basketball demonstration, the president said: I took 22 shots and made 2 of them. Thats right, 2 hits and 20 misses.

For me, this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays, I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley, or one of the few American versions, like Edmunds St. Johns, which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines.
