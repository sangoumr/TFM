Soon the march turns violent as the protesters are shot at. A down-tempo version of Heart of Glass by Blondie slinks through this sequence, which culminates with Offred and Moira taking cover in a vacant cafe.

Dove-gray recycled wood is a prominent feature, as are the high ceilings. The sushi is largely made of grains, vegetables and fruit. There are also rice-paper wraps, salads, noodle bowls, dumplings and a new line of soups.

A small nonprofit, it is as devoted to the margins of culture as its downtown counterparts. But instead of focusing on overlooked artists, its mission is the neglected medium of books, foremost writing, illustrating, printing and collecting  but only foremost. The last Grolier show concerned engravings of United States securities. Its next, opening Wednesday, May 17, examines modern calligraphy in the West, which is more obscure than medieval or Asian. The Calligraphy Revival: 1906 to 2016 traces its resurgence from the British scribe Edward Johnston (1872-1944) and the German type designer Rudolf Koch (1876-1934) through their students work and beyond. The 70 calligraphers include the polymath and type designer Hermann Zapf (1918-2015); he learned calligraphy from manuals by Johnston and Koch. Remember: Calli is Greek for beautiful.

Inspired by Neolithic Japanese, Cycladic and African traditions, her ceramics have the pockmarked surface of bleached-out brain coral and the faint hue of artifacts that have been buried in the ground for millennia. The Australian artist, who works in a small studio outside Sydney overlooking Tamarama beach, near the famous swells of Bondi, achieves this distinctive look with a mixture of modern and ancient methods. She eschews an electric potters wheel for the coiling method, an antediluvian technique in which small bands of clay are slowly stacked on top of one another to create a shape. Wilson then coats them, rather unorthodoxly, with an arsenal of naturally toxic chemicals  lithium, barium and silicon carbide  that slowly eat away at the special kind of terracotta clay she employs; and bits of paper embedded in the material burn during the firing process, creating her works signature porosity. Ive been experimenting with sea salt recently, says the 28-year-old mischievously. It melts and practically destroys everything it touches which I quite like.",2017-05-12T14:00:39+0000

Lynn Harriss Basketball Jones)  even bicycle racing, which was central to Chris Cleaves Gold. But hockey novels have been in short supply, as Keith Gessen noted in a 2006 essay for the Book Review: What is needed now, he argued, for the sake of both hockey and literature, is more hockey literature. Enter Fredrik Backman, whose novel Beartown, at No. 10 in its second week on the list, concerns a Swedish youth league team and its fraught place in a declining town. As popular Swedish exports go, Backman is up there with Abba and Stieg Larsson; his debut, A Man Called Ove, has sold millions of copies, and most of his subsequent books have also been best sellers. But in Beartown hes not skating by (so to speak) on his name alone; he really has a feel for the sport, and for sports in general. Hockey is just a silly little game, he writes. We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence.

Not just any men, but characters  workingmen, old men, homeless men, policemen and firemen. He would eventually follow the path of his father, Geoffrey, and work behind the bar. Two and Two is about Geoffreys 45-year career as a bartender; the deep and abiding bond between father and son; and the stories and people that made McSorleys a city institution.

Both versions follow Chris (Kathryn Hahn), a failing filmmaker, as she falls suddenly and completely in love with a mysterious intellectual named Dick (a character inspired, in the book, by the media theorist Dick Hebdige and played, on the show, by Kevin Bacon). In a perverse twist, she is egged on in her obsession by her husband, Dicks colleague Sylvre (Griffin Dunne), who is based on Krauss real-life ex, Sylvre Lotringer. Structured as a series of letters to Dick, the book reads more like an essay on love, art and philosophy than like a traditional novel  which makes it a pretty unlikely candidate for adaptation as a sitcom.",2017-05-15T17:13:59+0000

It was fascinating to watch a naked crab emerge from the fluted lip of a shell, looking for a new home. I filled a tank with large and midrange conchs. Construction sites opened up all over the tank. Conchs scraped around the sand, levitating on burnt orange claws. The hermits buried and exhumed themselves at unpredictable intervals. They outgrew and shed their bodies and each time this happened, it was magic. It made bodies seem fungible, an armature you could shuck and swap. They moved like a glacial version of the con mans shell game. They were master vanishers, digging down into the sandy substratum. Mine sometimes disappeared for days. Or they relocated at night, and I would spend a morning beaming affection at an empty shell. This was a little embarrassing. But it was also marvelous, to be so fooled.",2017-05-17T09:00:12+0000

When we visited that part of the country, which seemed to me as withered as Santo Domingo was lush, they never failed to appear  low-slung sweeps of light, streaking across a baseball field, vanishing into grass.

An oily mess like that should be toxic, Choudhary thought. Indeed, when he smeared the same amount of fatty acids on a plate of human pancreatic cells, the kind that supply the body with insulin, they self-destructed from the stress. Yet he knew the snake could somehow thrive, even as its plasma turned to yogurt after every single meal.",2017-05-17T09:00:22+0000

We thought it reminded us of something, but we couldnt put our finger on it  until we spent some time in the archives of YouTube, watching old clips of Celebrity Apprentice. It turns out that hints of Donald Trumps style of governance are right there in the boardroom scenes: not just his penchant for sudden dismissals, but also how much he relishes performing the role of a powerful person. We invited Emily Nussbaum, the Pulitzer Prize-winning television critic for The New Yorker to talk with us about Trumps obsession with TV and what shows we should consider watching in the wake of Trump. We take a look at the rise of fictional television shows that seem to speak to our new political reality  shows like Veep, The Handmaids Tale and The Leftovers. Those last two are set in dystopian versions of the future, where abnormal, unsettling events begin to seem ordinary, and they prompted us to ask a question: When we turn to art to explain to us a world that feels increasingly unreal, what can it tell us?",2017-05-18T10:00:04+0000

So Ill dish instead. Who knew that during Rices days as secretary of state, the former Libyan strongman Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was besotted with her? I support my darling black African woman, he said of Rice during a 2007 interview with the network Al Jazeera. I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders. He added: Yes, Leezza, Leezza, Leezza.  I love her very much. So when Rice included Tripoli on a visit to the Middle East the following year, there were some decidedly uncomfortable undercurrents in her meeting with Qaddafi. It had been a really strange trip, she writes, setting aside her usual diplomacy. I awoke with that sensation one has after a bizarre dream. Did I really just sit in his kitchen and have dinner with his female security guards who many believe are also his daughters? Did he really give me a video  with pictures of me set to music  called Black Flower in the White House? O.K. Whatever his weird affection for you, thank the Lord, that visit is over.

Here in New York, Wright aficionados who might otherwise be straining their necks at the Guggenheim will head to MoMA for Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive, not your typical monograph of the architects masterpieces. Curator Barry Bergdoll invited a handpicked group of scholars to explore the vast Wright archive that the museum comanages with Columbias Avery Library, then organized the show around the objects they found most compelling. The historian Jennifer Gray used a little-known Wright-designed logo for a conservation group to examine his ideas about the prairie. Ken Tadashi Oshima, a specialist on East-West influences in design, found an old book of images of the Imperial Hotel, with rickshaws and automobiles pictured out front. Its not some big statement, Bergdoll says. More a kaleidoscope of facets meant to open new lines of inquiry.  KATE GUADAGNINO",2017-05-19T19:14:56+0000
