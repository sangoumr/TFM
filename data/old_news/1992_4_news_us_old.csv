After a period of brilliant achievement in the late 1930's and early 40's, Ms. Levitt stopped making photographs for 15 years while she worked as a film editor and camera operator. Although she returned briefly to photography in 1959, virtually all the photographs she took in the following two years were stolen, and she did not begin photographing again until the early 1970's. Thus, there is a lacuna of more than 25 years in her photographic work.

us,In Short/Baseball; Now You Can Look It Up,"Casey Stengel played his first professional baseball game in 1910 and closed his managerial career with the New York Mets in 1965. In between, ""the old perfessor,"" winner of 10 pennants and seven world championships with the Yankees between 1949 and 1960, did an awful lot of talking or, more precisely, double-talking. Ira Berkow, a sports columnist at The New York Times, and Jim Kaplan, a former staff writer at Sports Illustrated, have dutifully collected Stengel's words, as well as those of many who knew him, on a variety of baseball-related subjects. Though Stengel managed teams with power hitters, he believed in manufacturing runs with good base running and timely hitting. This is pretty much what the authors have done -- that is, manufactured a book where there should not necessarily be one. This is not to say that THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO CASEY: Casey Stengel's Inimitable, Instructional, Historical Baseball Book (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $18.95) is not entertaining; it is, but only in small doses. It's the kind of book you can read during the lull between innings. Open it to any page and you'll find gems like Stengel's comment to Mickey Mantle when the slugger kicked a water cooler after striking out: ""It ain't the water cooler which is gettin' you out."" Or words of wisdom like ""When a fielder gets the pitcher into trouble, the pitcher has to pitch himself out of a slump he isn't in."" But the authors save the best for last in reproducing Stengel's mind-bending testimony at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly in 1958. It is a wily routine that easily rivals Abbott and Costello's ""Who's on First"" and proves that Stengel's prowess was not limited to the diamond.",1992-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The gallery on Maui where she was exhibiting agreed to ship the $500 purchase to my home in Connecticut, and charged me a 10 percent shipping fee (which seemed about right), payable to Ms. McCann. When the package arrived, nearly a month later, it carried a C.O.D. shipping charge of $45.95. At that point, there was nothing to do but pay it. When I complained to Ms. McCann, I was told that the $50 had been for ""packing,"" not full shipping. This ""packing"" consisted of a standard, light-duty cardboard box with a few handfuls of foam pellets, maybe $3 worth of materials in all -- resulting in a price increase of nearly 10 percent. JEAN B. MAURO North Haven, Conn. Ms. McCann responds: The standard packing fee for the galleries I deal with is 10 percent of the art value. We pay more for boxes and packing materials because of the freight charges to the United States mainland from Hawaii. This charge also includes the time involved to arrange shipping, correspondence and other related issues. Mr. Mauro came to my one-woman show at the Lahaina Art Society (a nonprofit organization where 30 percent of Mr. Mauro's cost of this art can be deducted as a donation from his taxes), and liked and purchased some art pieces from my husband (who was sitting the show for me that day).

Certainly Mr. Boesky, a billionaire until he was brought low by fines and prison time in Wall Street's junk bond scandal, has had cushier moments. Last week, the Associated Press and The New York Post reported that Mr. Boesky had asked the court to make Mrs. Boesky, who filed for divorce last year, pay him $20,000 a week -- $1,040,000 a year -- in temporary alimony. The two have a penthouse in Manhattan and a mansion in Westchester, both in her name. Last year, Mrs. Boesky sought possession of Mr. Boesky's Honolulu condominium when, she said, he failed to pay interest on $2.3 million in loans from her. Trying to keep their affairs private, the Boeskys, who have been married 30 years and have four grown children, have traded shots in State Supreme Court in Manhattan as Anonymous I vs. Anonymous II.

us,"Giants, Shepherds and Kings","Once there were no kings. Oh really? the children say. No kings? No, nor Presidents nor primary campaigns. Well, when did kings begin, they ask, and why? Were they good, or did they betray their friends or their wives? Did they retire when they got old? If they did bad things, were they good anyway? Here is THE STORY OF KING SAUL AND KING DAVID (123 pp. Schocken Books. $20. All ages) by Lore Segal, with illustrations from the Pamplona Bibles, to tell all about the first two kings. These are among the richest tales from the Old Testament and have modern echoes. Samuel was the last of the just judges of Israel. Alas, his sons ""went out for profit, took bribes, and bent justice to their own advantage,"" so the elders asked for a king. Samuel warned them against the greed of such rulers, but the Israelites persisted, and the Lord chose one. Tall, shy Saul hid to avoid his destiny but, once he became king, ruled well, until he disobeyed the Lord. Enter David, the ""young and rosy-cheeked and handsome"" shepherd boy, who slew the Philistine giant and was destined to be king instead of Saul's son, Jonathan, David's best friend. The struggles of Saul and David, the plotting and battles, the courtiers and lovers, the betrayals and triumphs are vivid and exciting. In the seasons of his life, as son, youth, king, lover, general, father and dying old man, David is fascinating. Ms. Segal says in the preface that she has followed ""the modern trend to avoid the fancy-dress sound of antiquity . . . to produce an English syntax . . . not to sound solemn."" She has succeeded so brilliantly that reading aloud in a baffling political season, a weary adult can recall the true complexity of leadership.",1992-04-12T05:00:00+0000

Modern country allows for individualism, but only in tandem with an overriding respect for tradition. The more skillfully a singer reworks the formula to his or her advantage, the better the chance of finding gold on the highway (and having a hit on country radio).

She believed in the promise of Communism and joined the ruling party, but was expelled after a few years for her liberal views. In 1982 she began protesting the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles on East German soil, and a year later she helped organize a human rights group called the Church From Below. She was constantly harassed by the Stasi, once imprisoned, and fired from her job at a Government research institute. By maintaining her principles despite such pressure, Wollenberger emerged as a heroine of the movement that brought down Communist rule, and in 1990, at the age of 38, won election to the Bonn Parliament.",1992-04-12T05:00:00+0000
us,From Above the Andes,"Marilyn Bridges's striking black-and-white aerial photographs taken in Peru during 1988 and 1989 give an otherworldly view of a country too often noted for cholera, inflation, economic scandals and political terrorism. Flying over the country's majestic terrain, Ms. Bridges recorded abstract patterns and forms, concentrating on archeological traces of earlier Andean peoples. PLANET PERU: An Aerial Journey Through a Timeless Land (Kodak/Aperture, $35) conveys an atmosphere of stillness and wonder quite unlike the usual arid archeological images. From her elevated perspective, Mrs. Bridges uses the raking light of early morning and late afternoon to delineate and animate adobe pyramids, ancient roadways and terraced fields. A large section of the book is devoted to geoglyphs -- drawings and geometric markings made many hundreds of years ago that stretch for miles over the land. The few photographs that include vestiges of modern life -- a truck on a coastal highway, a desert billboard, a cement factory -- share with the others a concern for formal beauty and the elemental power of nature. John Hyslop, an archeologist with the Institute of Andean Research and the American Museum of Natural History, provides the accompanying historical commentary on Incan and pre-Incan civilizations, and Fernando Belaunde Terry, a former president of Peru, offers an introduction. Although the photographs are attractively reproduced, the design of ""Planet Peru"" does not serve them well.

But when the first round of the Heritage Classic was done, Love was up front with a four-under-par 67 that included two eagles, three birdies and three bogeys. Love is trying to become only the second player to win the Heritage in two consecutive years. He had a one-shot lead over four golfers. Tied at 68 were Lanny Wadkins, Brad Faxon, Ed Humenik and 43-year-old Bruce Fleisher, whose 31 on the front nine was one stroke off the course record. (AP) Horror Show on Links: A three-club wind rocked players back on their heels, produced some ridiculous scores and turned the first round of the PGA Seniors Championship into a golfing horror show yesterday in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Gary Player and Larry Ziegler, each with a 69, were the only players to break 70. The average score was slightly over 78 and more than one-third of the field shot 80 and up in winds the weather bureau said gusted to 30 miles an hour. The 56-year-old Player, a three-time winner of the event, said he could recall only two instances in his globe-trotting, 36-year career in which winds were more severe. Lee Trevino matched par and the defending champion, Jack Nicklaus, birdied the 18th for a 73. Arnold Palmer struggled to a 77. (AP) Ridgeway Holds 3-Shot Lead: Angie Ridgeway, a 27-year-old rookie, shot an eight-under-par 64 to hold a three-shot lead after the first round of the S.E.G.A. Women's Championship yesterday in Stockbridge, Ga. Ridgeway, who qualified for the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour last October after four years on the Futures Tour, had no bogeys in her lowest round since graduating from Appalachian State University in 1987. Tied for second were Caroline Pierce of England, Laurel Kean, Missie Berteotti, Deb Richard and Val Skinner. (AP) TENNIS Sampras and Forget Win Easily Top-seeded Pete Sampras of the United States and second-seeded Guy Forget of France advanced to the quarterfinals of the Nice Open in France with straight-set victories yesterday. Sampras beat a former French Open champion, Andres Gomez of Ecuador, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, while Forget defeated German Lopez of Spain, 6-2, 6-3. In other second-round play, Henri Leconte of France defeated Tomas Carbonell of Spain, 6-3, 6-1, and seventh-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain breezed past Nicklas Kulti of Sweden, 6-1, 6-2. Leconte will play Sampras in the quarterfinals today. Leconte beat Sampras in a crucial Davis Cup match last December in Lyons when France upset the United States in the final. Sampras struggled a little against Gomez, but managed to beat another good clay-court player. In the first round, he beat Martin Jaite of Argentina, the defending Nice champion. Forget defeated Lopez in just 55 minutes. (AP) Chang and Gilbert in Quarterfinals: Michael Chang and Brad Gilbert won second-round matches in the Salem Open in Hong Kong yesterday and advanced to the quarterfinals. Chang, seeded second, beat a fellow American, Jim Grabb, 6-2, 6-4. Gilbert, seeded fourth, defeated Michiel Schapers of the Netherlands, 7-5, 6-3. Shuzo Matsuoka of Japan outlasted the 1991 finalist, Wally Masur of Australia, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, and also made the quarterfinals along with sixth-seeded Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, who defeated a German qualifier, Bernd Karbacher, 7-5, 7-5. Matsuoka, ranked 87th in the world, will play Gilbert in the quarterfinals. South African-born Kevin Curren, who now plays out of the United States, may have to withdraw from his quarterfinal match today because of a leg injury. He had X-rays taken last night and was to learn this morning if he could play against Australian Todd Woodbridge. (AP) Agassi Beats Unseeded Italian: Second-seeded Andre Agassi was all business yesterday in beating Claudio Pistolesi of Italy, 6-1, 6-2, yesterday in a second-round match at the United States Tennis Association clay-courts championships in Tampa, Fla. Agassi needed just 57 minutes to dispatch the unseeded Italian and set up a quarterfinal meeting with unseeded Franco Davin, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 winner over Jean-Philippe Fleurian. Earlier, fourth-seeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru also reached the quarterfinals by edging unseeded Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands, 6-4, 6-4.

Irish Coffeetable","On Grafton Street in Dublin, ""the air pends with significance"" for Thomas Keneally, the Australian novelist whose grandparents were part of the flood of Irish emigration before the turn of the century. ""The always but never known place"" is what Ireland is to people of the diaspora, he writes. A worldly unworldliness shapes the life of this land of saints and scholars, and it is this sensibility that intrigued Mr. Keneally as he explored a country ""crammed with failed fortifications."" In this land ""haunted by absences"" the author finds the laughers ""are balanced out by the dour and the canonical."" He discovers that ""history bites back"" in Ulster, a place he finds ""is neither peace nor war, and it is both."" But Mr. Keneally seems so dazzled by his adventure that he has lost his ability to discern what is significant and what is merely another Irish experience. (Thus the generous helpings of that staple from the travel writer's menu, the wisdom of hitchhikers.) NOW AND IN TIME TO BE: Ireland & the Irish (Norton, $45) is a pretty book, illustrated with appealing color photographs by Patrick Prendergast, but its look is one that readers expect to encounter in magazines.",1992-04-19T05:00:00+0000

It was in this era, the belle epoque, that the novelist Giuseppe di Lampedusa grew up in Palermo and where, like Prince Salina in ""The Leopard,"" witnessed an era of fancy-dress balls and ironic frivolity that would soon give way to a dark period of war, economic ruin and decay.

In a first-round match lacking excitement and quality play, the 20-year-old South African was able to beat Borg despite a thigh problem that affected his play throughout the match. Ferreira had to receive treatment to the back of his left leg after the third game. He continued to play, making errors but still keeping pace with the 35-year-old Borg. Ferreira is ranked 22d in the world and beat John McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Borg is currently tied for 1,094th. After a first set that lasted 71 minutes, Ferreira raced through the second set in 25 minutes. After losing the opening set despite having a set point in the 10th game, Borg said he became frustrated. The match was almost a duplicate of Borg's first-round loss last week in Nice, when a flu-weakened Frenchman, Olivier Delaitre, beat him, 7-5, 6-2. Last year, amid heavy publicity, Borg tried to start a comeback here but lost in the opening round to Jordi Arrese of Spain in straight sets. In other first-round matches yesterday, Thomas Muster of Austria outlasted Henri Leconte of France, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3; Sergi Bruguera of Spain, the defending champion, beat countryman Francisco Clavet, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5; Carl-Uwe Steeb of Germany beat Martin Jaite of Argentina, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5); Magnus Larsson of Sweden beat his countryman Jonas Svensson, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4); Lars Wahlgren of Sweden defeated another Swede, Johan Carlsson, 6-3, 6-1, and Christian Bergstrom of Sweden defeated Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3.

us,This Sand Was Made For You And Me,"We regain a little of our innocence during the hours we preen, play and rest at the beach. The photographer Elliott Erwitt captures that innocence while often poking gentle fun in ELLIOTT ERWITT: ON THE BEACH (Norton, $39.95). These pictures are not portraits or art photographs or messages in bottles. They are sly ""snaps,"" as the photographer refers to them, which is not to say they are not marvelous compositions of texture and opposition. The photographs have a witty spontaneity, yet they are well-observed commentaries from a man with an impish affection for his subject and a keen eye for the ridiculous. These beaches are not remote coves, rare and scenically spectacular; they are the common beaches from around the world. The people Mr. Erwitt photographs are variously dressed: a picture taken in Brighton, England, in 1956 shows a man in shirt sleeves, tie and trousers, escorting his children in an afternoon of play; another, taken in Ile du Levant, France, in 1968, shows a couple with nothing on at all. Some of the nicest photos are of dogs frolicking. And there is the unexpected: a boy walking a pig on a leash. Mr. Erwitt's photographs make us feel the way we do while on the beach: ready for anything, willing for a few hours to assume a more benevolent and tolerant view of our fellow man.",1992-04-26T05:00:00+0000

The fine print was complicated, including shared financing of production costs with domestic theatrical, video and television profits going to Fox. But foreign rights for techno-thrillers such as ""Terminator 2"" and Mr. Cameron's other offspring, tend to provide about 60 percent of the profits. These rights stay with the 37-year-old producer's Lightstorm production company. Pies so big are difficult to see, but Larry Kassanoff, who runs Lightstorm, described the arrangement modestly.

(AP) GOLF Trevino and Hill on Top Defending champions Lee Trevino and Mike Hill, despite two bogeys on the front nine, held off all challengers yesterday to win the Legends of Golf in Austin, Tex. The pair shot a seven-under-par final-round 65 to finish the two-man, better-ball tournament at a 37-under 251. Trevino and Hill started the final round of the $770,000 event with a four-shot lead after shooting a blistering 60 on Saturday. But they bogeyed the 400-yard, par-4 fourth hole and the 165-yard ninth. When Jim Colbert rolled in his eagle putt from the back fringe at the 270-yard par-4 12th, Trevino and Hill appeared in jeopardy of dropping to second -- as they had done last year before rebounding to a two-shot victory. But they birdied 13, 16 and 18 while Colbert and Tommy Aaron, his partner, could manage only pars on 13 through 17.
