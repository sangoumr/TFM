us,Albany: Increased Spending for Legal Aid,"Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed new regulations yesterday that are expected to increase by more than fourfold state spending on civil legal services for the poor. The regulations will require banks to pay a far higher interest rate on funds deposited in special accounts that lawyers use to temporarily hold money deposited by clients. Interest from these accounts has traditionally been used to pay for civil legal services, but banks have been paying an interest rate of 0.5 percent, on average. The new regulations will require banks to pay a more competitive rate of about 2.7 percent. The change, which requires a 45-day comment period but not legislative approval, is expected to increase financing for civil legal services for the poor from more than $13 million to as much as $65 million.",2007-06-01T04:00:00+0000

Thats very interesting, because David Gordon is first rate and not ideological, and because Policy Planning is a key portfolio in any administration in developing long-range policy. Of course, hard-liners in the Office of the Vice President can still out-maneuver the sensible people, as they have for most of the last six years, but its nice to see good people appointed to top posts. Steve Clemons, who writes the Note, says that Gordons appointment is indicative of better people going into posts more recently, and maybe theres some truth to that. If the administration had started with Bob Gates and Gordon England at the Pentagon, instead of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, with Zoellick at the World Bank  and, best of all, with somebody like Tom Ridge as vice president rather than Cheney  then Bush might have avoided a failed presidency.

In 15th- and 16th-century Germany, parents were told to send their children to school when the children started to act rational. And in contemporary America, children are deemed eligible to enter kindergarten according to an arbitrary date on the calendar known as the birthday cutoff  that is, when the state, or in some instances the school district, determines they are old enough. The birthday cutoffs span six months, from Indiana, where a child must turn 5 by July 1 of the year he enters kindergarten, to Connecticut, where he must turn 5 by Jan. 1 of his kindergarten year. Children can start school a year late, but in general they cannot start a year early. As a result, when the 22 kindergartners entered Jane Andersens class at the Glen Arden Elementary School near Asheville, N.C., one warm April morning, each brought with her or him a snack and a unique set of gifts and challenges, which included for some whats referred to in education circles as the gift of time.",2007-06-03T04:00:00+0000

He simply worried, he wrote, for any author who attempts any kind of elaborate sex scene, because of the possibility that it may come to the notice of the Bad Sex police.

Experiencing on the set a dj vu trip back to the mid-1970s (felons have received lesser sentences), Nack was stirred again by the memory of Ruffian. As he writes in this short, fascinating, melancholy hybrid of turf history and personal memoir, I have thought of Ruffian so often over the years that today she flits around like a ghost in all the mustier rooms of my reveries, a boarder who has had a run of the place.",2007-06-03T04:00:00+0000

us,Josephine Baker in Art and Life,"Josephine Baker's cultural legacy is still alive beyond the hundredth anniversary of her birth in 1906. It exists in live performances, art, photography, fashion, film, literature, and social activism. Baker mesmerized audiences during her lifetime and continues to attract and mystify biographers. Much recent scholarship on Baker has placed her in a pantheon of black feminist heroines, which often has produced a larger-than-life, one-dimensional image. Regardless of the reasons for such depictions, there is a need to remove Baker from reductive stereotypes and to humanize her legacy. This book explores the complex construction of Baker's multiple images in art and life. It is concerned with how art transforms social life, and how life imitates art. Although it presents and evaluates carefully researched biographical facts, it is not a biography. Rather, it offers critical reflections on the symbolic Baker and the images that she and her collaborators constructed during the era of modernity and for the postmodern future.

us,From a Cause to a Style,"In the 1980s, the Prince of Wales, who has adopted a number of surprising causes for a prince in the course of his life, became for a time the most influential critic of architecture, urban design, and planning in Great Britain. Both modernist architecture and modernist city planning had been very successful in Britain-as indeed they have been almost everywhere-in shaping new towns and rebuilding the centers of old cities and towns. But ordinary people often looked on the results with dismay. The prince's interventions and criticisms received wide publicity, and were effective in derailing some high-profile projects by modernist architects. ",2007-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Contested Waters," Philadelphia opened one of the earliest municipal pools in America on June 21, 1884, at the intersection of Twelfth and Wharton Streets. The ""swimming bath,"" as it was commonly called, was so popular with the boys and young men of this immigrant, working-class neighborhood that they regularly waited an hour in line to enter. During the first few days, the crowd outside the pool often became unruly. The youths argued, fought, and tried to sneak ahead of one another in line. On the night of June 24, the usual ruckus escalated into a small riot. It started when the superintendent informed the expectant swimmers that they would not be admitted that evening because the pool was already filled to capacity. As the crowd grew incensed, the superintendent retreated inside the building and bolted the door. According to a local newspaper, the fifty or so young men who had been turned away ""concluded to override his authority by the superiority of their numbers."" They tore the door from its hinges and knocked down the fence that surrounded the pool. The city had stationed a police detail at the pool in anticipation of disorderly behavior, but the four officers were no match for the angry crowd. They were ""tossed about like little bits of driftwood in rough water."" Police reinforcements eventually restored order ""with a liberal application of their clubs,"" but not before the pool and the reputation of the bathers had been severely damaged. The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorialized that ""the good [the pool] has accomplished amongst the unwashed down-town youths has been more than counterbalanced by the harm a certain gang of roughs has seen fit in their ignorant and brutal natures to inflict."" Commissioner of City Property William Dixey, whose department administered the pool, promised that ""if such conduct is kept up,"" he would ""close the house and keep it closed.""

us,On Chesil Beach," They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible. But it is never easy. They had just sat down to supper in a tiny sitting room on the first floor of a Georgian inn. In the next room, visible through the open door, was a four-poster bed, rather narrow, whose bedcover was pure white and stretched startlingly smooth, as though by no human hand. Edward did not mention that he had never stayed in a hotel before, whereas Florence, after many trips as a child with her father, was an old hand. Superficially, they were in fine spirits. Their wedding, at St. Mary's, Oxford, had gone well; the service was decorous, the reception jolly, the send-off from school and college friends raucous and uplifting. Her parents had not condescended to his, as they had feared, and his mother had not significantly misbehaved, or completely forgotten the purpose of the occasion. The couple had driven away in a small car belonging to Florence's mother and arrived in the early evening at their hotel on the Dorset coast in weather that was not perfect for mid-July or the circumstances, but entirely adequate: it was not raining, but nor was it quite warm enough, according to Florence, to eat outside on the terrace as they had hoped. Edward thought it was, but, polite to a fault, he would not think of contradicting her on such an evening. ",2007-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Sack of Panama," 'Land ahead on the starboard bow!' It was noon on 25 May 1666 when the ageing privateer, Captain Edward Mansfield, heard the lookout's cry. He clambered up into the rigging to check his position. One quick look through his perspective glass and he could relax. There was no mistaking the rugged hills, over a thousand feet high, of the lonely island which the English called Providence and the Spaniards called Santa Catalina. The old captain glanced back at the rest of his squadron. All four ships were still in sight, spread out across the otherwise empty sea. They all looked as though they had been a long time out of port, weather-beaten, paint faded, sails patched, but still moving well through the water, their bottoms clean after a recent careening. Three of them were very small, lateen-rigged sloops with no deck or cabin to protect their cramped crews from sun and sea and rain; and even the fourth was only about fifty tons, a small, square-rigged, half-decked frigate which, like Mansfield's own similar ship, had been recently captured from the Spaniards off the Central American coast. None of them carried many cannon, but no one who saw them would have been in any doubt that they were best to be avoided. Small, fast ships like these, crammed with men who knew from experience that four muskets could do as much execution as one cannon, had terrorized the waters and coastal settlements of the Caribbean for decades. Mansfield signalled the frigate to furl her topsails to reduce visibility and crept forward towards his goal. By late afternoon he was only twelve miles from the southernmost point of the island, and the squadron hove to until nightfall. Tomorrow, with any luck, the island would be his.

Philbrick, the author of the National Book Award-winning In the Heart of the Sea, finds striking parallels between past and present, particularly the way Plymouths leaders, including Miles Standish, rejected diplomatic overtures toward the Indians and instead pursued a policy of violent aggression that led to the needless bloodshed of King Philips War.

It trails Yankee Stadium, which sells about 30,000 a game but did not answer the survey. (A reader raised the issue after an article on May 11 about the introduction of Latin food at Yankee Stadium mentioned the higher figure for the Yankees. Unfortunately for the reader, who vowed not to consume any dogs at either stadium until it has been settled, this correction was delayed for research; but the Mets have a home game tomorrow night.)",2007-06-04T04:00:00+0000

Several writers  notably Barbara Kingsolver and Michael Pollan  have written best-sellers urging us eat local and organic, but Ronald Bailey at Reason has some qualms:Kingsolver adopts absolutely every one the modern urban fables with regard to food production, starting with the claim that organic is more nutritious. There is very little scientific evidence for that claim. In addition, organic is not necessarily better for nature since yields are generally lower than conventional farming, which means that more land must be used to produce food. Reading Kingsolver, one could also conclude that pesticides were created by giant chemical companies whose sole aim was to cause cancer. But even the American Cancer Society agrees that there is no evidence that residues of pesticides and herbicides at the low doses found in foods increase the risk of cancer. Studies also show that eliminating pesticides could cut corn yields by 30 percent, rice by 57 percent, soybeans by 37 percent, and wheat by 24 percent. Again, that would mean that a lot more of nature would have to be plowed up to maintain the food supply at current levels.",2007-06-04T13:36:48+0000

Mr. Khouzam fled to the United States nine years ago, claiming that he had been detained and tortured because he refused to convert to Islam. He denies the murder accusation. In 2004, a federal appeals court allowed Mr. Khouzam to remain in the United States because it determined that he would quite likely face torture if he returned to Egypt. After being freed from detention in 2006, Mr. Khouzam was detained again May 29, after the Egyptian government provided diplomatic assurances that he would not be tortured.",2007-06-07T04:00:00+0000

Mr. Sinagra is charged with the 1990 killing of the witness, Patrick Porco, 18. Prosecutors brought murder charges against Mr. Sinagra last year as part of their case against a former F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, who has been accused of helping a Mafia informer commit several killings. Justice Reichbach called a series of hearings compelling prosecutors to show good cause for their delay in bringing charges. Prosecutors have disclosed documents showing that Mr. Sinagra was named as a suspect as early as 1995, but that the police later closed the case, attributing the Porco killing to a man who had since died.",2007-06-08T04:00:00+0000

But perhaps now it will be, with the republication of his work in two new volumes that should bring Michaels to a new generation of readers and remind us of his lasting achievement. The Collected Stories includes the full contents of his acclaimed first two volumes, Going Places (1969) and I Would Have Saved Them if I Could (1975), as well as selections from his later writing, including all the existing Nachman stories. Sylvia is a fictionalized memoir, first published in 1992, about Michaelss first wife, Sylvia Bloch, who committed suicide. ",2007-06-10T04:00:00+0000

She had already explained why rich people dont eat casseroles, why poor people hang their pictures high up on the wall, why middle-class people pretend to like people they cant stand. She had gone through the difference between generational poverty and situational poverty and the difference between new money and old money, and she had done a riff on how middle-class people are so self-satisfied that they think everyone wants to be middle class.",2007-06-10T04:00:00+0000

Since Jan 23, United States citizens as well as those from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean have been required for the first time to present a valid passport when entering the United States by air. A rush for passports has created long processing delays, partly because of confusion among some travelers, who mistakenly thought they needed a passport to return to the United States from Canada or Mexico by car. That requirement will not take effect until next year. Maura Harty, the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, said that the demand for passports was over and beyond even the enormous demand we had expected, leading to the delays. In response, the State Department adjusted the rules so that through Sept. 30, those who can show proof they have applied for a passport, even if they have not received it, are exempt. The required documents are a government-issued photo ID and a printout showing that they have applied for a passport, which can be downloaded from travel.state.gov.passport.

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, upholds most of an earlier decision by a federal judge in Brooklyn. The officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft and Robert Mueller, the head of the F.B.I., had asked for dismissal of the lawsuit, by Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani immigrant, arguing in part that the government was entitled to take actions that might not have been lawful before 9/11. Although acknowledging some forms of government action in emergencies may exceed normal constitutional limits, Judge Jon O. Newman rejected the officials contention, saying some protections against some of the violations claimed, such as needlessly harsh confinement and ethnic discrimination, do not vary with surrounding circumstances. The strength of our system of constitutional rights derives from the steadfast protection of those rights in both normal and unusual times, he wrote.",2007-06-15T04:00:00+0000

The blues were political and personal complaints, including denunciations of the war, a song about Hurricane Katrina and a song about money troubles that announced, I aint broke but Im badly bent. And the instrumentals veered toward the harmolodic zigzags of Ornette Coleman: setting out melodies at willful, shifty speeds, improvising over a vamp. In both blues and instrumentals, he loosed a new idea at each break: searing sustained lines, phrases that scurried into different keys, bent and wah-wahed notes, crunched funk chords.

A few days later, a friend sent me Donald Halls book about Eagle Pond, his home in New Hampshire, and there were more woodcuts: of skaters on the ice, a dog curled at his masters feet, clouds billowing over mountains, clapboard houses and placid streams. Apart from slicing my palm open with an X-Acto knife while cutting a picture into a block of linoleum during seventh-grade art class, I havent spent five seconds thinking about woodcuts.

us,Prenatal Scare,"Clare Clarks first novel, published in 2005, was inauspiciously  but accurately  titled. The Great Stink offered a richly imagined re-creation of Victorian Londons sewers, a murky labyrinth in which a mildly crazy ex-soldier, newly employed as an engineer, discovers a corpse and finds himself suspected of murder. Praised for the ingenuity of its plotting, this accomplished book also won plaudits for the authenticity of its detail and its almost queasily intense exuberance. Clark, who paid generous acknowledgment to the inspiration of Peter Ackroyds pyrotechnic style, joined him as a highflier, soaring through a dreamscape of her own imagining, yet grounding it in the bricks, mortar and mud of a well-researched past. Her strikingly well-written book was also huge fun to read.",2007-06-17T04:00:00+0000

Patterson, who reviews Supreme Discomfort, a biography of Thomas, on the cover of this issue, elaborated in an e-mail message: The American public has in recent decades adopted far more nuanced and progressive views than its political and intellectual leaders on both right and left. We are currently living through a good example of this in the immigration debate. As for race relations today, he thinks extremism on both sides is flatly rejected.

One great exception is Willa Cathers 1925 novel, The Professors House. Cather used the traditional calling of a scholar and the atrophy of his marriage to convey her own growing alienation from the modern world. Her novel has only one successor, another book that invokes the life of learning as a rebuke to the wasteful wars and cheap compromises of the wider world. John Williamss Stoner is something rarer than a great novel  it is a perfect novel, so well told and beautifully written, so deeply moving, that it takes your breath away. Ignored on publication in 1965, a clamorous year, it has been kept alive by enthusiasts who go into print every decade to rediscover it, including Irving Howe in The New Republic in 1966, C. P. Snow in The Financial Times in 1973, Dan Wakefield in Ploughshares in 1981 and Steve Almond in Tin House in 2003. They invariably wonder why no one has heard of the book. Why isnt this book famous? Snow kept asking. Now, along with Williamss earlier novel, Butchers Crossing (1960), Stoner is available in a handsome reprint by New York Review Books. Both books deserve to be widely read, but their dark, comfortless vision raises the question of whether this can be expected.",2007-06-17T04:00:00+0000

us,Natures Engraver: A Life of Thomas Bewick,"Printing from woodblocks is the oldest way of all. Before Gutenberg invented moveable type around 1450, books and broadsheets were produced by writing the text on wood in reverse, as in a mirror, and then cutting painstakingly round the letters, dabbing the block with ink and pressing paper on top. With the new metal type, printers still used the blocks for illustrations and a single block could be used over and over again, on different pages, in different books. The early cutters worked on the 'side-grain' of the wood, a plank cut along the trunk, often of a fruitwood such as pear or cherry, using carpenters' tools - knives, chisels and gouges. When designed by masters like Drer or Holbein these woodcuts could attain an astounding delicacy, but increasingly book publishers preferred to use copper engravings which gave a finer effect, and the crude woodcuts were banished to broadsides and chapbooks. Slowly, however, craftsmen tried using the dense end-grain of wood, sliced across the trunk or branch rather than along it like a plank. Boxwood proved the best, because box grows so slowly that the growth-lines are very close and on its hard surface the engravers could use the fine tools employed on silver or copper.",2007-06-17T07:48:00+0000

Theres a sense, however, that couture is again in some kind of transit phase. The Valentino company has a new owner and theres a question of what will happen to couture when Valentino retires. This past Thursday, in Paris, I sat down with Alber Elbaz to ask what couture means to a younger generation of design innovators. What would induce a designer like Elbaz, or Marc Jacobs, or Nicolas Ghesquiere, to want to be part of an old-school couture house? Are theyand fashionmissing something?",2007-06-17T17:08:08+0000

He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on Friday in Milan and was hospitalized. Ferre was for many years a leading designer in Milan, beginning his career in the mid 1970s after receiving a degree in architecture. There was always something over-the-top about Ferres clothesthe white shirt collars always high and sculptural, the leather often laced and assertive, the coats swinging. I once began a review of a Ferre show, in the early 90s, with: Diva, can you dig it? His clothes had a great sexual energy, if you got your head into them, and I loved that he didnt seem to care a jot about trends and skinny models and so forth. His Dior period was not especially memorable, at least for me, and perhaps thats because he never seemed very happy there (living in the Plaza Athenee), and of course Dior in the early 90s was in transition, not the old style but not quite yet the new era of Galliano and Bernard Arnault.

Hyde, a former general manager at Dillons in Manhattan, said Mr. Ramsay falsely claimed that meat was spoiled, used a defective chair to imply that the restaurants furniture was shoddy and hired actors to pose as customers to make the restaurant appear busy by the end of the week.

Jennifer Sprague, a Fox spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said she could not comment, and Andrew Blackmore, a manager at Dillons, said he had signed a release stating that he could not discuss the show with the news media.

The woman, Lucinda Pettway Franklin, contends that one of the dealers, Matt Arnett, asked two years ago to borrow the quilts to have them examined and photographed for a book. But the quilts, along with another made by her mother and an aunt, have not been returned, despite requests, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in Alabama. Newer quilts of their kind sell for tens of thousands of dollars; the value of older ones is much higher. The suit is the third filed recently against Mr. Arnett; his brother, Paul; and his father, William, who have long represented and promoted the quilters in Gees Bend, an isolated, historically black community. Two earlier suits say that the Arnetts have defrauded Gees Bend quilters. Gregory H. Hawley, a lawyer representing the Arnetts, was unavailable for comment yesterday, his law firm said.

In the introduction to that volume, he announced his intention of establishing a historical account of the Holocaust in which the policies of the perpetrators, the attitudes of surrounding society and the world of the victims could be addressed within an integrated framework. Such a framework has indeed been missing from most historical accounts of this most difficult and challenging of subjects. They have focused either on the processes of decision-making and their implementation or on the world of suffering and death experienced by the victims. Friedlnders first volume stood out from most other work in this field because it successfully combined both of these aspects. And his second volume does so as well. It now establishes itself as the standard historical work on Nazi Germanys mass murder of Europes Jews. ",2007-06-24T04:00:00+0000

And while recent terrorist bombings have rattled Bali's blissful pace (it is a Hindu-majority island in a Muslim-majority nation), they have done little to temper its popularity or discourage super-chic resorts from being built.

Scandinavians differentiate between loneliness and solitude as a matter of course. But Trond, insinuating at times, but colloquial and close to ones ear, tells a candid story so concretely that the reader has to live it out. I have been lucky, he says of his life, while acknowledging that he has always longed to be alone. Has the death of his wife liberated him? He says only, I lost interest in talking to people. He will indeed learn to talk, alone, in the middle of a train of thought when the difference between talking and not talking is slowly wiped out. Reflecting upon his move to the country, he says, I had put myself in an impossible situation. He sleeps poorly because in the quiet, the past presses in upon him and it is disturbing. The millennium is nigh but he expects it to mean nothing. While the fireworks are elsewhere, he will get drunk and listen to Billie Holiday on his record player. We accept that cultivated people turn up in such places, though Americans tend to view them as Edward Dahlberg described the conventional view of Thoreau, as a kind of cranky male sibyl, a crabbed and catarrhal water sprite of our woodland culture.

Part of the blame lies with President Mahmoud Abbas, who has proved utterly unable to cope with the challenges of leadership, a fact only underscored by his firing of the elected Hamas government that had already in effect fired him. Israels wildly unpopular prime minister, Ehud Olmert (a man whose approval rating recently hit 2 percent), played a contributing role by bombing Gaza last summer (in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers), a move that further weakened Abbas and his Fatah party. The Bush administration, too, deserves its share of the blame for openly neglecting the Middle East conflict for its first four years in office. As it turned out, feeling abandoned made ordinary Palestinians despondent about the prospects for peace  which enabled them to cast protest votes for Hamas without worrying that its election would effectively scuttle an already moribund peace process.",2007-06-24T04:00:00+0000

Its author was none other than Gerd Heinrich, his Papa. Why not call the book an hommage, then? It is ultimately that too, yet the whiff of theft in the air is the first clue that what follows will be no ordinary account of a son following in his fathers footsteps.

Harriet Tubman, the novelist Beverly Lowrys contribution, is labeled a biography, but the subtitle, Imagining a Life, qualifies that claim. In an authors note, Lowry painstakingly explains her decision to emphasize the visual elements of Harriets story  what things looked like, places and clothes, faces, plants, the sky  and to thread information from the sources listed in her bibliography in order to come up with one version of what life might have been like for the American hero Harriet Tubman.

But this extraordinary marriage of setting and architecture only partly explains the fame of Machu Picchu today. Just as important is the romantic history, both of the people who built it in this remote place and of the explorer who brought it to the attention of the world. The Inca succumbed to Spanish conquest in the 16th century; and the explorer Hiram Bingham III, whose long life lasted almost as many years as the Inca empire, died in 1956.

For men like Washington, Jefferson and Adams, Wood writes, the idea of character was the outer life, the public person trying to show the world that he was living up to the values and duties that the best of the culture imposed on him. Wood situates the founders within the historical and political tumult of their times and argues that the very egalitarian democracy they created all but guarantees that we will never again replicate this extraordinary generation.

A few minutes after midnight as Britain was entering the war, an illegitimate baby was born in a conspicuously anonymous redbrick house on the northern coast. His mother, Rebecca West, whose real name, which nobody used, was Cicily Fairfield, held the sleeping bundle in her arms, while her sister and a friend perched on her bed. The baby's father, H. G. Wells, was one hundred miles away, sitting up late in his llama-wool pajamas, in the second-floor study of his large comfortable house in Essex, putting the finishing touches on an essay for the Daily Chronicle, which he was planning to call ""The War That Will End War."" He poured himself a cup of tea, which he had brewed himself on the small stove nestled in the fireplace, and nibbled a dry biscuit. His wife, Jane, was asleep in the bedroom, her dark blond hair fanned out against the pillow. He loved his wife, and he loved his young mistress. He loved his ivy-covered Georgian house, Easton Glebe, which was a gracious symbol of how far he had come from his hardscrabble origins. Unlike nearly everyone he knew, Wells was feeling optimistic about the war, exhilarated by the possibilities of the world in flux. Through his window he could see the familiar outline of a fig tree in the darkness. ",2007-06-24T16:29:00+0000

She used to make her own beer, but now, in her mid-eighties, she likes Coors from a can; and because her gnarled hands are too weak, she cannot pull off the tabs. Duke, the huge shepherd-hound that she rescued from the pound, is at her feet, and a one-legged chicken lies cradled in her lap. She is mildly irritated at me for arriving unannounced (I have a tendency either to just show up or to come an hour later than I've promised, which annoys her also), but soon I have placated her and she offers me a beer.

Babel has confessed: One story will not change that, nor will it save him. Still, Kutyrev has insisted the matter be formally resolved, and since Pavel must now answer to the ambitious young lieutenant, the question of authorship is to be settled, if only for the record. Already an empty office upstairs has been reserved for the purpose. In due course the appointed morning comes.

They also include some discussion of assassination plots against foreign leaders. The C.I.A. account of these activities, running nearly 700 pages, is known as the Family Jewels. It consists of responses by C.I.A. officials to a 1973 directive from the Director of Central Intelligence, James Schlesinger, to inform him of any activities that might violate the agencys charter. Many pages of the material made public today were excised by the agency. Many of the operations were disclosed in press reports in the mid-1970s beginning with a Dec. 22, 1974 story in The New York Times by Seymour M. Hersh. A commission appointed by President Gerald R. Ford and headed by his Vice President, Nelson A. Rockefeller, investigated the C.I.A. activities, as did a Senate committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, and a House committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike, Democrat of New York.

us,'E PLURIBUS VENOM',"E PLURIBUS VENOM The paradox of well-heeled and wealthy art collectors fawning over rebellious street art is apparent everywhere in the art world. The graffiti artist known as Banksy is the toast of London, while Shepard Fairey is approaching cult status in Los Angeles for his posters and stickers of the face of the professional wrestler Andre the Giant with the word obey emblazoned across them. Mr. Fairey, 37, is now having his first major New York gallery exhibition, split between the Jonathan LeVine Gallery in Chelsea and a rented 6,600-square-foot warehouse exhibition space in Brooklyn for huge graffiti installations and murals. (Last weeks opening in Brooklyn was disrupted by a man trying to set off an incendiary device.) There are about 80 works between the two sites, together forming a comprehensive, 20-year survey of his artwork in various mediums: screen prints, stencils, stickers, album covers, collage, spray paint and more. Despite the range of mediums and styles, the imagery comes off as generic, combining decorative elements with political metaphors, like an image of a couple cuddling a bomb. (Right is War for Sale.) Its Norman Rockwell crossed with the Dead Kennedys crossed with Communist-era propaganda. References to capitalism and war predominate, especially in the Chelsea show, where many works are neatly framed and ready for sale. It is tempting to see this stuff as just another luxury commodity.

us,'LE DOULOS',"LE DOULOS Jean-Pierre Melvilles brutal and subtly brilliant policier Le Doulos (shot in 1962, released in 1963) underscores why the French put the name to film noir. Based on the Pierre Lesou novel published by Gallimard in its celebrated Srie Noire line, the film follows the parallel fates of two criminals  Jean-Paul Belmondo as Silien, Serge Reggiani as Maurice  bound by an almost mystical sense of masculine loyalty. Mr. Belmondo, below, who had recently worn a priests collar for Melville in Lon Morin, Prtre (1961), enters Le Doulos in a more familiar Melvillian costume of a belted trench coat and fedora. A stated friend to Maurice as well as to the police, he first appears masked by an enveloping shadow, his silhouette framed in a doorway. He remains a darkly obscured figure for much of the rest of the story, a disturbing question mark for both Maurice (who believes in him) and the audience (who may not). The story eases and lurches, at times mechanistically, but what sticks and sticks hard is the way Melville fashions an entire world out of a threadbare room, a light swinging as if from a gallows, an ominous hat-check number, filigrees of cool jazz, an hourglass figure that melts into the image of a yapping dog and a masterly sense of cinematic space, exemplified by a lengthy interrogation scene. In Le Doulos the camera and the actors move in a silent conspiracy, revealing more about the true nature of a man far in advance of any line of dialogue. Le Doulos will be shown in a new 35-millimeter print, making it even easier to swoon into its darkness.

us,NIK BARTSCH'S RONIN,"NIK BRTSCHS RONIN Zen-funk is the term that Nik Brtsch, a Swiss pianist, uses to describe the music of his five-piece band, Ronin, above. Its an eminently printable phrase, but it cleanly misses the mark. True, Mr. Brtsch composed the pieces for his recent album, Stoa (ECM), during a six-month residency in Japan. And, yes, at times those pieces do flirt with funkiness, though to draw allusions to James Brown, as some reviewers have, following Mr. Brtschs lead, is a rather dubious stretch. The problem with the term is its connotation of mind-clearing tranquillity, when Ronin proposes something much more heady and premeditated. Stoa, for instance, relies on a precision movement of interlocking parts in a manner suggestive of a timepiece. (The Swiss and the Japanese have long had this expertise in common, after all.) Minimalism is a useful frame of reference, in the same way that it is for some hard-to-classify American bands. One track on the album, Modul 35, could be considered an acoustic corollary to the music of Battles; elsewhere theres a vague resemblance to Tortoise. And videotape of Mr. Brtsch and his colleagues performing Modul 33 last fall (find it on YouTube, or at nikbaertsch.com) brings to mind the contemporary chamber group So Percussion. Next weeks showcase, which comes on the heels of festival appearances in Vancouver and Montreal, will mark Ronins United States debut. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Brtsch will engage the drummer Kaspar Rast, the percussionist Andi Pupato, the bassist Bjrn Meyer and the clarinetist Stefan Haslebacher in a tricky yet ethereal interaction thats more vivid in performance than on record. Maybe it will be meditative, and maybe it will get funky. Whatever the case, the crowd response will surely outdo the sound of one hand clapping.

After militants briefly besieged the city of Nalchik in 2005, the authorities stacked more than 100 bodies in an unrefrigerated container.

What have I held onto for so long? he asked, and then answered: stabbing his second wife, Adele, in 1960. Its something Ill probably never write about, he said. Ive never felt ready to write about it. Unless you can write something thats brilliant, he added, youre better off not writing about it at all.

But when Seun Kuti (above), 24, Felas youngest son, began performing with his fathers band, the Egypt 80, he faced another formidable contender: his older half-brother Femi, who since the late 80s has earned the respect of critics and Afrobeat fans  not a crowd easily impressed  for his saxophone populism. Luckily or unluckily for both, their father is truly inimitable, and in addition to his music  a deliriously warped reflection of James Browns funk  Fela left a tradition of fearless political dissidence. As Seun Kuti told The Observer, the British newspaper, three years ago when graduating from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, his fathers music is a mission that lives on, with room for plenty of inheritors. Things in Nigeria are even worse now, he said, and however hard it is to live up to his legacy, we have to carry on the fight for liberation and consciousness.
