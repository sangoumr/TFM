The match was played following a brawl that led the police to detain 73 English fans, who were accused of smashing up a bar. England hadn't lost to Norway since 1981. Oyvind Leonhardsen scored with three minutes left in the first half and Lars Bohinen ended a slick three-man attack by scoring three minutes after the break for Norway (5-0-1), which leads Group 2 with 11 points. England (3-1-3) is second with 9 points, followed by the Netherlands (3-1-2) and Poland (3-0-2) with 8 points each. The top two teams in each European group qualify for the World Cup finals next year in the United States. (AP)",1993-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Suffering through an off night, the all-American pitcher allowed 12 hits and 5 runs and threw 172 pitches before the Longhorns edged Oklahoma State, 6-5, in a first-round game. Kieschnick (16-3), a first-round draft pick of the Chicago Cubs, gave up singles to Sean Hugo and Peter Prodanov in the ninth before making Thad Chaddrick his 11th strikeout victim to end the game. In an afternoon game, Darren Dreifort, Wichita State's relief ace, hit the game-winning home run in the 11th inning and then got the save as Wichita State defeated Arizona State, 4-3. Dreifort was within a strike of collecting his fifth save of the season in the ninth when A.S.U.'s Sean Tyler hit a homer to tie the score at 3-3. But Dreifort (11-1), a second-round choice of the Dodgers in the draft, hit his 21st homer to lead off the 11th and then survived a two-on rally in the bottom of the inning. Dreifort was chosen second by the Dodgers in the major league draft. (AP) TENNIS Navratilova Is Winner Top-seeded Martina Navratilova took advantage of the service errors and inexperience of Dutch teen-ager Kristie Boogert yesterday to post a 6-3, 6-3 victory at the Beckenham grass-court event in England. Navratilova then made a plea to Wimbledon's seeding committee to put her in the half of the draw that doesn't contain defending champion Steffi Graf. ""I think I should be seeded joint No. 2 with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario behind Steffi,"" said the nine-time Wimbledon champion. Navratilova does not want to be seeded third and face the possibility of meeting Graf in the Wimbledon semifinals. The fifth-seeded Boogert, 19 years old, broke Navratilova's serve early in the second set but then was broken three times by the 36-year-old left-hander. In the men's semifinals of the exhibition tournament, second-seeded David Wheaton defeated fellow American Ken Flach, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3, 6-2. Wheaton, a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1991, will face Chris Bailey of Britain in today's final. Bailey also needed three sets to defeat 13th-seeded Grant Stafford of South Africa, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3.

The Ukrainian, who has set world records 34 times, got off to a rocky start by missing at 18-8 1/4. But he sailed easily over the bar on his second try at that height and on his first attempt at 19-2 1/4 before asking that the bar be set just above his world-record mark of 20-1 1/4.

us,They Had Wings of Angels,"Lynn Johnson and Michael O'Leary's EN ROUTE: Label Art From the Golden Age of Air Travel (120 pp., Chronicle, paper, $14.95) is a charmer, made up of very little (but always useful) text and page after page of exact color replicas of the labels produced by the airlines in the early decades to adorn one's luggage and service one's ego. Curiously, though flying was then more primitive, it was also more comfortable. In 1934, American Airlines coaxed Douglas Aircraft into coming up with something that would be called a DC-3. This pleasure dome would carry 14 passengers, with one berth each, from New York to Los Angeles. Before then, the trip took 25 hours and required 15 stops. Now you stopped only three times, and were there in 17 hours and 30 minutes. The volume's endpapers invoke the view-from-the-air of the modernist T.W.A. The graphic shows us two routes from west to east. To fly to Europe meant landings at Newfoundland, Ireland and Paris or Newfoundland, the Azores and Lisbon. It is the curse of the jet that except when traveling to the Far East one is never in it long enough to eat, drink, be merry and sleep. The label art reminds us at once of the airlines' utilitarian beginnings (""Hoosier Airplane Lines. 1923 Charter. 1924 Air Taxi. Serving Fort Wayne, Muncie, Indianapolis, Vincennes and Terre Haute. 'Silver Wings,' Operator"") and of the ends they would go to in trying to make you feel loved. ""American Flagship Skysleeper"" wasn't a bag tag -- that was the legend painted on the hull of the DC-3. When ux and I went off on our wedding trip in 1950, we rented the tail end of the Pan Am DC-4, a mini-suite. Price? $150. . . .

From the beginning, he tells us in STRAIGHT UP OR ON THE ROCKS: A Cultural History of American Drink (Simon & Schuster, $18), this was a tippling country. The colonists displayed a knack for experimentation and improvisation, making alcoholic drink from ""anything that would ferment."" Beer, cider and especially rum were consumed with gusto and in a myriad of combinations with other ingredients. As America pushed westward, rum gave way to whisky, and the national appetite increased. Liquor was considered a health-giving beverage, and, Mr. Grimes reports, ""At least one 19th-century insurance company imposed a surcharge on abstainers, regarded as weak and weedy, and unquestionably a bad health risk."" The 19th century saw the rise of the saloon and the emergence of bartending as an honorable and highly respected profession. The later part of the century saw the birth of most of the classic cocktails -- including the martini, the manhattan and the old-fashioned. Prohibition ""turned a lot of beer and wine drinkers into whisky drinkers."" Gin, once a drink for down-and-outers, became ""the spirit of the age."" The period following Repeal has been, in the author's view, ""a dreary saga of industry consolidation, mass marketing of image, and anxious trend-watching. The cocktail has suffered as a result."" And what is the prognosis for the future of the cocktail? Mr. Grimes finds hope in two disparate groups: immigrants, rum and tequila drinkers who may ""impart new vigor"" to the cocktail; and yuppies, whose status-seeking insistence on ""the best"" disdains the blandness of blended whiskies and watery beers. The author includes recipes for 110 cocktails, both classics and worthy newcomers.",1993-06-06T05:00:00+0000

It lies on a climatic fault line where westerly winds blowing off the North Sea meet dry winds blowing, reputedly, out of the Russian steppes. People look out their windows into claustrophobic courtyards and then spend their weekends walking through vast, forestlike parks. Architecturally, it is a city of confounding ugliness -- of once pompous prewar buildings with their now charred, or missing, or jarringly restored facades; of banal, poured-concrete apartments and office blocks on both sides of the former wall; of contemporary architectural experiments that can look like recent wounds surrounded by so many scars. It is also a city of exquisite, if infrequent, beauty. Karl Friedrich Schinkel's cool classicism, for instance. And the inspired, often utopian innovations of the 1920's -- many influenced by Schinkel -- are often, even in their postwar, reconstructed versions, still exciting and surprising. Schinkel's buildings, many of which are in the center of the city, are almost unavoidable, but the best examples of Weimar-era architecture are -- to my mind -- the great housing developments known as public-housing estates, or Gross-Siedlung.

Ferreira had problems handling Martin's consistent serve until midway through the match. He also was overpowered in the first-set tie breaker as the American moved smoothly into a 5-1 lead. The South African pounced on Martin's errors to tie the match by winning the second set and broke for a 6-5 lead in the third with rain starting to fall. He clinched a place in the final of the Stella Artois championship when Martin netted a service return. (AP)",1993-06-13T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIARY,"THE ECONOMY On Those Worries About Renewed Inflation: Never Mind The Administration must have been greatly relieved at Friday's report on inflation -- or, at least in May, the lack of it. Before the report, the White House kept saying how important low interest rates were in keeping the economy on the mend. And it kept up the pressure on the Federal Reserve not to raise rates, fearing that if prices jumped again, the central bank might act quickly. Then it turned out that producer prices were unchanged last month -- erasing, in many economists' minds, the specter of an inflationary surge. Suddenly, the White House anxiety vanished, with President Clinton's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, even saying that she hadn't really been worried by the earlier increases in producer prices -- 0.6 percent in April, 0.4 percent in March. Financial markets had obviously been worried, though, because interest rates fell sharply in heavy buying in the bond market. A Crumbling Budget Plan Imagine a sizable block of stone. Then imagine a horde of would-be sculptors attacking it with chisels and hammers. And when, their passion spent, they pull back to pronounce their work complete, nothing is left but a pebble. That seems the likely fate of President Clinton's ambitious economic plan. Yes, something may still pass Congress, but how much of the original vision will remain? The latest, and biggest, hunk of stone to crash to the floor was the proposed tax on the heat content of fuels, which Mr. Clinton abandoned last week in the face of rising opposition. This was to raise nearly a third of the $250 billion in sought-for new taxes, and any compromise that now emerges -- like a gasoline tax -- is sure to fall short. When the pebble is finally thrown at the deficit, that monster probably won't even flinch. Fly Now -- or Sue Later You dash to the gate, ticket in hand, but the plane is full. To most people, this is cause for rejoicing, because the airline will hand you several hundred dollars to ease the pain -- and also probably get you on a plane in a couple of hours. Most people would gladly sit and read for $100 or so an hour. But there are, inevitably, some I'm-not-going-to-take-it types, and a Federal appeals court has ruled that if they're bumped, they can sue for damages. But airlines are not about to alter their meticulously calibrated overbooking formulas -- only one traveler in 10,000 is grounded under protest. And since punitive damages are not allowed, that one is unlikely to take on a legal crusade. Boesky, Back From the Gutter The rich are indeed different. They may say they're broke, but that's not quite what they mean. After Ivan Boesky settled insider-trading charges, paying a $100 million fine, he gladly opened his wallet to show the bare, lonely leather. Of course his wife, Seema, had a little left -- $100 million or so -- and Mr. Boesky quickly demanded half. Last week, as part of a divorce settlement, he got a bit less than that, but he did get $20 million, a $2.5 million house and -- so that he wouldn't have to dip into capital -- $180,000 a year in pocket money. Less Deadly Lighters Each year, Americans buy half a billion butane lighters -- that's two for every woman, man and child. It's that child that's the problem. Children, being children, tend to play with lighters -- causing, each year, an estimated 5,000 fires, and 150 deaths. So last week the Consumer Product Safety Commission ordered manufacturers to make lighters too difficult for most children under 5 to operate. Now there's an idea: just make them too difficult for most adults to operate, too, and a few people might wind up giving their lungs a break. 'Diet Plate'? Prove It! What, exactly, does ""diet plate"" mean on a restaurant menu? Right now, just about anything. If your local diner wants to write ""diet plate"" next to a listing for steak, french fries and buttered roll, it's free to do so. Or it can use a cute little heart symbol, suggesting that this meal can somehow substitute for a morning jog. And it doesn't take much to convince customers, who are all too happy to believe that the good stuff is also the healthy stuff. Now, the Food and Drug Administration wants a few more facts on the table. Last week it announced new rules to require restaurants to back up any nutrition claims on menus. ""Low-fat,"" you say? Give me the numbers. Cite chapter and verse. Reading menus could soon get pretty strenuous. Wouldn't it be easier to go for that jog? COMPANIES Heir a Bit Less Apparent Robert M. Haft had big plans for running the Dart Group -- to ""let people make mistakes,"" to double earnings in four years. But he may have rolled up his sleeves a bit too soon -- and it could be a costly mistake. After all, his 72-year-old father, Herbert H. Haft, is still chairman of Dart, and from all appearances did not take kindly to his 40-year-old heir apparent's bold words. It didn't help his mood to read in April that his son, who had built Crown Books into a power, had been ""de facto chief executive"" for two years. Last week the elder Mr. Haft moved to remove his son from the board -- and with 57 percent of the voting stock, he's likely to get his way. Opening Up Cable TV It's easy to say that any upstart can get into cable television -- that true competition exists. But if the little guys can't get HBO, say, or 24-hour sports, what chance do they have? Not much. But last week, in a big step toward more competition -- and, very likely, lower prices -- seven top cable companies settled a long antitrust investigation, agreeing to loosen the reins on popular programming. True, recent legislation mandates much of this, but the pact appears to go further in requiring companies to license channels to rivals that transmit by satellite, microwave or, eventually, phone lines. So the cable future is heading for your living room, and you may even save a few pennies when it gets there. Rethinking an S.& L. Deal As the Government rushed to unload insolvent savings and loans, it made some pretty strange deals. Try this one: In 1988, regulators promised nearly $2 billion in subsidies to James M. Fail to create Bluebonnet Savings from 15 Texas S.& L.'s. You'd think Mr. Fail was a solid citizen, and was investing sizable sums of his own. Not quite. He'd been indicted for fraud and was barred from doing business in Alabama. And what came out of his pocket? A cool $1,000, with the rest borrowed. Bluebonnet, and Mr. Fail, are thriving. The Government, after five years, suddenly came to and said, ""Wait a minute!"" Last week, regulators sued Mr. Fail for fraud, saying he had been less than candid about his past. Lean Profits at Apple Computer Apple Computer is selling a lot more personal computers, but investors are enjoying it a lot less. Apple said on Wednesday that its earnings would fall, and its shares plunged 10 percent -- ending the week at $43.75, off fully 25 percent since May 20. The problem, oddly, is that Apple did just what it set out to do: grab more of the PC market. With sales up 35 percent lately, it has joined I.B.M. at the top of the heap. But everything conspired to slice away at profits: rivals cut prices, forcing a price war, and as low-end machines became more powerful, more people bought these less-profitable models. And as computers go from being miracle machines to just another familiar commodity, buyers learn how to avoid paying a penny more than they have to. Investing in the Printed Word The New York Times Company agreed last week to buy The Boston Globe, New England's largest newspaper, for $1.1 billion. Both saw clear benefits in the deal: The Globe, owned by two family trusts, avoids any chance of a messy takeover battle when those trusts expire in 1996, while the Times Company extends its reach in the populous corridor from Maine to Washington. Times stock lost $2.50 on Friday, to $24.375, the day after the announcement. Affiliated Publications, The Globe's owner, gained 37.5 cents, to $13.625. INTERNATIONAL France Gives In on Farm Cuts Leading nations have tried for years to find a consensus on world trade, but snags persist. Here's a big one: The United States says that by subsidizing farmers, Europe holds an unfair edge in the market for oilseed products, but France has resisted cutting output. It is no small matter, because oilseeds, used for vegetable oils and animal feed, are a huge business. But last week, possibly feeling world pressure, France dropped its opposition. Now France will have its hands full calming the irate, and highly vocal, farm lobby. Club Med Goes to China This just about settles it. China is joining the 20th century, with all its pains, all its well-scripted pleasures. Club Med is coming to China. A year-round resort, complete with golf course and casino, will be built on the island of Hainan. Club Med clearly could not ignore the Asian appetite for vacations. In addition to Chinese visitors, it expects many from Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Japanese, in fact, now make up 6.2 percent of its customers. No Aristide, No Oil In more poetic times, a face could launch a thousand ships. These days, it's oil that makes things happen -- or at least that's what the United Nations is betting. Last week the Security Council decided that since all else had failed, it would play a powerful economic card to pressure Haiti to restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power -- it planned to impose a worldwide ban on oil exports to Haiti. The United States has had an oil embargo for over a year, but diplomats have said that only a global ban could get the attention of Haiti's military rulers.",1993-06-13T05:00:00+0000

Tales of the Vienna Streets","An insightful photographic portrait, VIENNA 1850-1930: Architecture (Rizzoli, $65) provides a panorama of Viennese architecture during an era when the city was one of the most important intellectual and cultural centers in Europe. An essay by Peter Haiko, an architectural historian who teaches at the University of Vienna, provides a competent and accessible introduction to the historical events and theoretical issues for those unfamiliar with the architecture of the period. The heart of the book, however, is the fine color and black-and-white photographs of more than 30 structures documenting the metamorphosis of Vienna from a Baroque capital draped in the mantle of historicist styles to the stern, uncompromising forms of the modern city. In addition to civic and religious structures, the building types surveyed include private villas, apartment buildings and municipal structures like gasworks, water towers and bridges. Like the finest examples of human portraiture, Roberto Schezen's photographs reveal character as well as physiognomy. While his treatment of facades and major interior spaces conveys the public decorum and grand scale of urban architecture, his photographs of building details and eccentric spaces reveal intriguing facets of his subjects. Mr. Schezen possesses a wonderful eye for decorative details. The result is an unusually subtle and nuanced description of architecture. This photographic paean to Vienna vividly testifies to architecture's ability to transcend the requirements of mere shelter and evoke the spirit of an age and the character of a place.",1993-06-13T05:00:00+0000

The two big servers seemed headed for a tie breaker in the first set until Stich dug out a superb cross-court return in the eighth game. Ferreira, seeded seventh, then volleyed long on break point to fall behind, 5-3. Stich then served out the first set. Ferreira, who was also Stich's doubles partner in the tournament, started the second set with a double-fault and was broken by two blistering backhand returns. Stich raced to a 5-1 lead before being broken for the only time, then rebounded with two aces to close out the 57-minute victory. (AP) Boetsch Gets First Victory: Arnaud Boetsch of France rallied to beat Wally Masur of Australia, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, in the championship of the Continental grass court championships in Rosmalen, the Netherlands. The eighth-seeded Boetsch, the 29th-ranked player in the world, earned his first ATP Tour tournament victory and became the first Frenchman to win a grass-court event since Henri Leconte in Sydney, Australia, in 1985.

The firm, the only tenant that never physically returned to the center after the explosion on Feb. 26, had been strongly considering relocating even before the bombing and said it was not leaving out of dissatisfaction with the Port Authority's response to the disaster.

REGION WILD CHASE AFTER ROBBERY An armed bank robbery touched off a high-speed, 35-minute car chase marked by repeated exchanges of gunfire on some of the busiest highways in Rockland County, N.Y., and Bergen County, N.J. About 100 shots were fired by the fleeing suspects and the pursuing police over the 30 miles of the chase. The pursuit began at Pearl River High School about 9:15 A.M and ended about 11 A.M. with the capture of four suspects as they ran from a stolen getaway car into woods beside the Garden State Parkway in the Bergen County suburb of Washington Township, officials said. Page 26. CIVIL-RIGHTS CHARGES DROPPED Federal prosecutors in Camden, N.J., dropped civil rights charges against two men three days before their retrial in the beating of an Asian Indian physician. Judge Joseph E. Irenas of Federal District Court said that prosecutors did their duty in trying to prove that the attack was racially motivated. The second trial for Mark Evangelista, a 23-year-old Hudson County police officer who lives in Jersey City, and Martin Riccardi, 26, of North Plainfield, was scheduled to start on Monday. A third defendant was acquitted on May 28. The three were accused of beating Dr. Kaushal Sharan in the Heights section of Jersey City in September 1987. Page 26. About New York by Michael T.

SUMMER'S STORY (Knopf, $17), a seemingly sprightly fable of childhood adventure and discovery by the German novelist Patrick Suskind, whose malevolent first novel, ""Perfume,"" was an international best seller. Unlike most coming-of-age stories, this one explores not only the mysteries of duty and desire, injustice, aging and death -- but also Galileo's laws of falling bodies. Set in a pleasant lakeside village ""shortly after the war,"" the tale is narrated by a nameless boy who loves his typically incomprehensible parents, dotes on his elusive sweetheart and despises his hilariously cranky piano teacher. Gravity (and perhaps gravitas) enters the life of this child ""so light I could fly"" in the form of the mysterious Mr. Summer, an eccentric recluse who spends all his time ferociously striding about the countryside, and whose single utterance is an angry ""Why can't you just leave me in peace!"" Like a force of nature, Mr. Summer pulls the airy narrator down to earth, providing sobering lessons about childhood foibles and grown-up fears. And if the translation by John E. Woods occasionally provides a few thuds of its own (""They were only dreams, and like all dreams not really emotionally satisfying""), the accompanying drawings by Jean-Jacques Sempe have the ethereal quality of innocence just on the brink of being lost.",1993-06-20T05:00:00+0000

Riccardo ""wants everything"": fame, designer clothes, an expensive car, a fancy address, a summer retreat, swanky friends, experimental sex and, above all, money. And he gets it -- gets a radio talk show and a showpiece girlfriend too, an economist, appropriately enough. He does all this by writing smart-alecky and irreverent biographies of the church fathers. These biographies succeed, however, because of Valentina's research and editing, for which she has received no recompense, material or emotional. One day she hears furtive scratchings on the door of her apartment, formerly theirs, and through the peephole discovers her ex-husband removing the brass plaque on which is engraved his name, formerly theirs.

Muster took 1 hour 45 minutes to defeat the third-seeded Swede, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. Gustafsson nearly won the first set, breaking Muster and gaining five set points, four of which he lost on errors. Muster then held on to win the tiebreaker, 7-3. Muster applied steady pressure in the second set, winning on his second match point. The Austrian won the Florence ATP Tour event on June 13. (AP) AUTO RACING Peugeot Troika Wins 24 Hours of Le Mans Defending champion Peugeot swept the top three places in the prestigious 24-hour Le Mans endurance race yesterday in France, holding off a fading challenge by Toyota, whose powerhouse racers were plagued by mishaps and structural problems. Toyota was fourth with one of its TS010 cars. Thousands of racing fans swarmed around the finish area where the Peugeot 905, piloted by Australian Geoff Brabham, took the checkered flag under a beating sun at 4 P.M. (local time), 24 hours after taking off in the grueling annual race. (AP) Martin On Empty; Rudd in Winner's Circle: Mark Martin's empty gas tank was the difference as Ricky Rudd inherited the lead nine laps from the finish and went on to victory in the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. Martin led for 141 of the 200 laps but knew he was in trouble after making a green-flag pit stop with 55 laps to go. He came out of that pit-stop shuffle on top, but knowing that his Ford Thunderbird, despite being easily the fastest car on the track, could not make it to the end without one last splash of gas. Meanwhile, Rudd, who announced Saturday he will field his own Winston Cup team next season, was able to stretch his final stop to lap 150 and was nearly certain he could go the distance. Steve Hmiel, Martin's crew chief, told his driver over the radio to pit on lap 190, but changed his mind, telling him to take one more lap. It turned out to be a mistake as Martin ran out of gas on the backstretch and had to coast to the pits. (AP) GOLF Rodriguez Triumphs by Two Strokes Chi Chi Rodriguez, winner of only one tournament the past two seasons, shot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to win the inaugural Burnet Senior Classic in Coon Rapids, Minn., by two strokes over Bob Murphy and Jim Colbert. Rodriguez, second on the career Senior PGA Tour money list, birdied four consecutive holes -- 8 through 11 -- to take the lead for good at the Bunker Hills Golf Course. He then parred the next six holes before wrapping up his only title of 1993 with a birdie on 18. (AP) Green Repels Sheehan for Victory: Tammie Green held off defending champion Patty Sheehan to win the Ladies Professional Golf Association Rochester International by one stroke. Green's two-under-par 70 in the final round was a far cry from her career-best 63 Saturday, but it gave her a 72-hole total of 276, her third L.P.G.A. victory and the $75,000 winner's check. She had four birdies and two bogeys in the final round that was interrupted by a half-hour rain delay in the afternoon. (AP) SOCCER Mexico Ties Argentina in America Cup Mexico dominated defending champion Argentina but managed only a 1-1 tie in a Group C in an America Cup game yesterday in Guayaquil, Ecuador yesterday. David Patino put the Mexicans ahead in the 15th minute and Oscar Ruggeri tied in the 28th. Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Goycoechea made several good saves in denying Mexico the deciding goal. Argentina leads Group C with 3 points and is in good position to move into the quarterfinals. Mexico, with 1 point, will need a good result Wednesday against Bolivia in order to advance. Colombia, which beat Mexico, 2-1, in the first game, tied Bolivia, 1-1, in a late game. (AP) China Defeats Iraq in World Cup Qualifier: China beat Iraq, 2-1, and Jordan took a 4-0 first half lead en route to a 5-0 victory over Pakistan yesterday in Beijing in the World Cup Asian Zone Group A qualifying tournament. Despite its loss, Iraq will move on to the second round of the Asian Zone qualifying tournament by virtue of its 6-1-1 record. China was next at 6-2-0. (AP) Real Madrid Loss Means Title for Barcelona: In a stunning repetition of last season's dramatic finale, Tenerife shocked Real Madrid, 2-0, yesterday to hand F.C. Barcelona its third consecutive championship of the Spanish league. Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov snapped out of his slump to lead Barcelona to a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad. Argentine forward Oscar Alberto Dertycia, meanwhile, scored Tenerife's first goal to send it on its way to victory over Real Madrid. The stunning conclusion marked the second season in a row in which Real Madrid entered the final week of the season with a 1-point lead in the standing only to lose to Tenerife and see the title taken from its grasp. (AP) BOXING Norris Knockdown Gave His Corner a Scare The official record of Saturday night's super-welterweight championship fight will show that Terry Norris retained his World Boxing Council title by defeating Australian Troy Waters. He won when Waters failed to answer the bell for the fourth round. What the record won't convey is that Norris's camp suffered some nightmarish moments when Waters knocked Norris to the canvas in the second round. The knockdown stunned Norris; his manager, Joe Sayatovich and the 11,646 fans at the Sports Arena. Norris had knocked down Waters in the opening round and then did so again in the third, with a crisp right to the head. When the badly cut Waters was unable to answer the bell for the fourth round, the fight was over. Until Saturday night, Norris had only been knocked down once in his career; in 1989 in a loss to Julian Jackson. Since that defeat, Norris has run off 14 straight victories to improve his record to 35-3 with 20 knockouts.",1993-06-21T05:00:00+0000

They were one stroke ahead of Jack Nicklaus, who designed the 6,876-yard course, and Jim Colbert. The top of the leader board was a familiar spot for Albus, who stunned the golf world by winning this tournament in 1991 while still working as a club pro at Piping Rock Club in Locust Valley, L.I. (AP) Stadler and Maltbie Fire 65's: Craig Stadler and Roger Maltbie came within a shot of the course record as they shot five-under-par 65's to share the first-round lead in the Canon Greater Hartford Open in Cromwell, Conn. John Huston, Keith Clearwater and Dan Forsman are a shot back and nine players, including Nick Price and Corey Pavin, were at three under. A day after only six players broke par on the TPC at River Highlands course during a celebrity pro-am because of wind gusting to 25 miles an hour. (AP) YACHT RACING New Winners in Day 4 Shifting winds off the Rhode Island coast yesterday stirred up a new set of winners in the fourth day of Block Island Race Week. Merrythought, the 62-foot sloop owned by Jack King of Annapolis, Md., edged the 50-foot Infinity out of the overall big-boat lead. Sailing aboard Merrythought was Gary Jobson, an America's Cup veteran. Both boats were designed by Bruce Farr of Annapolis, but Merrythought is 10 years older. Racing for the first time this month, Infinity, owned by John Thomson, of Port Washington, L.I., has been the favorite to win its class at Block Island. In another upset, Blue Yankee, a 43-foot sloop owned by Robert Towse, of Stamford, Conn., took over the lead in Class 2 from the 43-foot Barrister III. Eddie-Warden Owen, the top-ranked match-racer from England, sailed on Blue Yankee. BOXING Knockout for Snipes Renaldo Snipes, a 36-year-old former heavyweight contender on the comeback trail, made his fourth payday in the last three years pay off last night at the Paramount, where Madison Square Boxing staged its next-to-last program. The 215-pound Snipes raised his career record to 39-7-1 by scoring his 22d knockout, stopping Eddy Curry, a 193-pound cruiserweight, at 2 minutes 16 seconds of the third round. Snipes, a popular local fighter out of Yonkers, is hoping to be invited back to the last Garden-promoted card, scheduled for July 8. He floored Larry Holmes in his only title shot, a World Boxing Council challenge in 1981. But a controversial long count allowed the champion to get up, and then Holmes knocked out Snipes in the 11th round. In last night's featured bout, Lamar Parks, ranked among middlweight contenders by the W.B.C., came back from a first-round knockdown to win a unanimous decision over Danny Garcia of San Juan, P.R. Vasquez Keeps Title: Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto Rico retained his World Boxing Association super-bantamweight title last night by knocking out Thierry Jacob of France 45 seconds into the 10th round in Bordeaux, France.

Casey at the Bat (Road Game)","It was looking rather hopeful for our Dustburg team that day:We were leading Mudville 4 to 2 with an inning left to play.We got Cooney on a grounder and Muldoon on the same.Two down, none on, top of the ninth -- we thought we'd won the game.Mudville was despairing, and we grinned and cheered and clapped.It looked like after all these years our losing string had snapped.And we only wished that Casey, the big fat ugly lout,Could be the patsy who would make the final, shameful out.Oh how we hated Casey, he was a blot upon the game.Every dog in Dustburg barked at the mention of his name.A bully and a braggart, a fathead and a swine --If only Casey came to bat, we'd stick it where the moon don't shine!Two out and up came Flynn to bat, with Jimmy Blake on deck.And the former was a loser and the latter was a wreck;Though the game was in the bag, the Dustburg fans were hurtTo think that Casey would not come and get his just desert.But Flynn he got a single, a most unlikely sight,And Blake swung like a lady, but he parked it deep to right,And when the dust had lifted, and fickle fate had beckoned,There was Flynn on third base and Jimmy safe at second.Then from every Dustburg throat, there rose a lusty cry:""Bring up the slimy greaseball and let him stand and die.Throw the mighty slider and let him hear it whizAnd let him hit a pop-up like the pansy that he is.""There was pride in Casey's visage as he took a practice cut;There was scorn in his demeanor as he calmly scratched his butt.Ten thousand people booed him when he stepped into the box,And they made a rich raspberry when he bent to fix his socks.And now the fabled slider came spinning toward the mitt,And Casey watched it sliding and he did not go for it.And the umpire jerked his arm like he was hauling down the sun,And his cry rang from the box seats to the bleachers: Stee-rike One!Ten thousand Dustburg partisans raised such a mighty cheer,The pigeons overhead cut loose and ruined all the beer.""You filthy ignorant rotten bastard slimy son of a bitch,""We screamed at mighty Casey, and then came the second pitch.It was our hero's fastball, it came across the plate,And according to the radar gun, it was going 98.And according to the umpire, it came in straight and true,And the cry rang from the toilets to the bullpen: Stee-rike Two!Ten thousand Dustburg fans arose in joyful loud derisionTo question Casey's salary, his manhood and his vision.Then while the Dustburg pitcher put the rosin on the ball,Ten thousand people hooted to think of Casey's fall.O, the fury in his visage as he spat tobacco juiceAnd heard our little children screaming violent abuse.He knocked the dirt from off his spikes, reached down and eased his pants --""What's the matter? Did you lose em?"" cried a lady in the stands.And then the Dustburg pitcher stood majestic on the hill,And leaned in toward the plate, and then the crowd was still,And he went into his windup, and he kicked and let it go,And then the air was shattered by the force of Casey's blow.He swung so hard his hair fell off, and he fell down in disgraceAnd the Dustburg catcher held the ball, and the crowd tore up the place,With Casey prostrate in the dirt amid the screams and jeersWe threw beer cups down at him and other souvenirs.We pounded on the dugout roof as they helped him to the bench.Then we ran out to the parking lot and got a monkey wrenchAnd found the Mudville bus and took the lug nuts off the tires,And attached a firecracker to the alternator wires.We rubbed the doors and windows with a special kind of cheeseThat smells like something died from an intestinal disease.Old Casey took his sweet time, but we were glad to wait,And we showered him with gravel as the team came out the gate.So happy were the Dustburg fans that grand and glorious day,It took a dozen cops to help poor Casey get away,But we grabbed hold of the bumpers and we rocked him to and fro,And he cursed us from inside the bus, and gosh, we loved it so!Oh sometimes in America the sun is shining bright,Life is joyful sometimes, and all the world seems right,But there is no joy in Dustburg, no joy so pure and sweetAs when the mighty Casey fell, demolished, at our feet.",1993-06-27T05:00:00+0000

And the response, even among those who can afford the higher- priced threads, has been so terrific that designers have begun investing their bridge lines with distinct personalities (and heftier tariffs, now that they know what the traffic will bear). So what started as a way over trouble waters has become a fresher path to the designer exit. That is, until the toll goes too high.",1993-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
The Subject Was Horses","In what he called a ""world of 20th-century agitation,"" the Italian artist Marino Marini created some 400 sculptures, changing ""the form and expression of my work"" while feeling ""no need to change the subject."" MARINO MARINI: The Sculpture (Abrams, $75) manages an overview of his 60-year career. In the horse and rider, Marini (1901-80) sensed ""the whole story of humanity and nature at all times."" Unlike traditional representations of striding steeds and heroic generals, Marini's work depicted toil and tragedy. ""My aim is to render palpable the last stages in the dissolution of a myth, the myth of the heroic and victorious individual,"" the artist once wrote. Likewise, in portraiture, Marini attempted to create ""human documents, stripped of all historical pathos."" Sam Hunter, a professor of art and archeology at Princeton University, provides a broad overview of Marini's work, reflecting on its Roman and Etruscan influences and on his apprenticeship with the sculptors Arturo Martini and Medardo Rosso. The photographer David Finn has taken several shots of each piece, lingering over them as a visitor's eye might, coming closer to describe a texture, stepping back to appreciate a certain balance. Mr. Hunter appreciates that there is no better articulation of Marini's intentions than the artist's own words, and they are quoted at length, showing the humility and grace of Marini's apocalyptic vision: ""If the whole earth is destroyed in our atomic age, I feel that the human forms which may survive as mere fossils will have become sculptures similar to mine.""",1993-06-27T05:00:00+0000
