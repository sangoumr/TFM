us,The Screen: 'First Position' Arrives:Dance Documentary Is a Study in Depth The Cast Janis Roswick Seen as Aspirant Here,"Janis Roswick, who has the lead, of sorts, in William Richert's documentary, ""First Position,"" is an 18-year-old New York girl who hopes to become a dancer.She is pretty, a little plump, not noticeably graceful except when dancing, and resolutely middle class.Her public life is the round of ""classes"" (beginner, advanced beginner, intermediate and upward) that fill the days of any ballet student in this city. Her private life is a happy family outside Manhattan, a shared apartment in town, romantic interests in another student (Daniel Giagni) and an introspective diary in which she keeps account of these important years in her emotional and spiritual development. ""My pink stage is slowly becoming deep cranberry red . . ."" she writes. She isn't kidding.Janis has in superabundance the capacity for awe at herself that seems the identifying characteristic of bright young people native to New York City.But ""First Position"" isn't about Janis only. It is also about her boyfriend (not really; they're both too shy), whose life outside the dance includes training to be a clerk-typist in the National Guard. And it's about other students: a clever, ironic man who loses out in Janis's affections, and a talented but insecure boy who finally goes home to Florida to become a bagger in a supermarketafter almost succeeding at ballet school in New York.The school itself (the American Ballet Theater School, though its identity isn't too important) we know mainly through the qualities of some of its teachersthe vigorous Valentina Pereyaslavec, and Leon Danielian, severely crippled by arthritis, who spends most of the movie in a wheelchair. For an image of personal presence, Danielian's taking command over a dance class, even from a wheelchair, will do until something pretty spectacular comes along.From time to time the film cuts to passages from the recent Ballet Theater production of ""Petrushka""almost the only formal dancing in the movie.""Petrushka"" is in costume, but danced in a semi-darkened classroom rather than on stage. Given the ballet and the setting, the effect is chilling and oddly dispirited. This is what we see of success in the film's terms. It isn't glamour; it's more like loneliness and a vague fear.And it is emblematic of what raises ""First Position"" above the level of sensitive slice-of-life documentaryto provide a vision of what lies just beyond, say, the winning self-assertion of Janis's diary, the classroom discipline, or Danielian's personal bravery. Temporary victories against time, they lead finally to a lovely expression of defeat, and that is how they are understood in this very good movie.""First Position"" opened this week at the First Avenue Screening Room.",1973-06-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Elvis on Tour':Performer Is Pictured On and Off Stage The Cast,"A natural spin-off of the rock concert tour is the rock concert tour film, at which Pierre Adidge and Robert Abel (""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" ""Let The Good Times Roll"") are such experienced hands that I suspect they were inhibited by the magnitude of their latest subject, Elvis Presley. Or perhapsdare I say?his minitude.The movie is called ""Elvis on Tour"" and it purports to be an intimate portrait of Elvis as he revealed himself on recent tours, while performing onstage and while getting on and off airplanes, on and off buses, and in and out of limousines. Strip away the storybook myth andlothere is a storybook myth underneath: a nice, clean-cut, multimillionaire pop idol who is, offstage, hard-working and friendly and something less than a riveting personality.The essential blandness of the offstage Elvis has the effect of diminishing the impact of what we see of the onstage performances, which are presented with a lot of fancily photographed and edited split-screen frills that ultimately suggest that Elvis is much duller to watch than to hear.Whether this is his fault or the fault of the moviemakers, I don't know. It is quite apparent that Mr. Adidge and Mr. Abel are treating him with the kind of respect that French television used to reserve for the formal appearances of De Gaulle. The camera never catches him in a truly candid moment. Close-ups do not reveal anything but, rather, they enshrine an ideal, like an official photograph of a President or a Pope.Compared with ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" which chronicled the American concert tour of Joe Cocker in a way that reflected Cocker's tumultuous talent, ""Elvis on Tour"" seems almost stately. Elvis himself looks vaguely ill at ease in his baby blue (or scarlet), rhinestone-studded Batman costume, not really formidable enough to be announced (as the film does) with the first several bars of ""Thus Spake Zarathustra.""The film opened yesterday at the East 59th Street Twin 2 Theater and other theaters.",1973-06-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Oedipus Myth Is Theme of 'Parade of Roses',"Eddie, the transvestite hero of Toshio Matsumoto's 1969 Japanese film, ""Funeral Parade of Roses,"" keeps up a brave but frankly fake front.While his lover, Gonda, has a post-breakfast cigarette, Eddie frets with his hair. ""Do you like it up or down?"" he asks Gonda, who is the manager of Tokyo's Club Genet, where Eddie works as a B-boy. Gonda likes Eddie with hair up or down, but he has a ferocious mistress named Leda, who's jealous of Eddie and threatens to tell the cops about Gonda's drug trade.Eddie is young, beautiful and in love, but his story is messier than the plots of a half-dozen Bette Davis films. ""I feel as if life left me behind some time ago,"" he says.He keeps having these visions. Well, they aren't truly visions. The're more like flashbacks. As a child, Eddie murdered his mother and her lover with a carving knife. That was extremely messy and led to a certain period in jail, which was no fun at all.The one stable factor in Eddie's life is Gonda, but when you read in the ads that ""Funeral Parade of Roses"" is ""a modern reworking of the Oedipus myth,"" you are given a major clue as to who Gonda actually is. When Eddie finds out, it's back to the old carving knife.Like Eddie, who wears make-up, wigs, miniskirts and false eyelashes, which are as thick as the brushes in a carpet sweeper, the movie spends most of its time trying to disguise, its identity. ""Funeral Parade of Roses"" is a mopey soap opera made by someone who has seen too many better movies.Matsumoto uses speeded-up action, reverse-negative photography and ""in"" movie jokes that the subtitles invariably get wrong, as in a reference to ""Jonas Mecas."" Time is splintered for no apparent purpose and individual sequences are introduced by title cards that say such things as ""all doors are already open.""The film shows us an underworld of male prostitutes, pimps and drug pushers that looks comfortably middle-class, not much more desperate than Saturday at a country club. As literature, ""Funeral Parade of Roses"" is closer in spirit to something like ""A Stolen Life,"" in which Bette Davis played twins, than it is to the work of Gent, whose name the film uses in vain.""Funeral Parade of Roses"" opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room.",1973-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Hireling':Cannes Co-Winner Is at 68th St. Playhouse,"""The Hireling,"" Alan Bridges's film version of the L. P. Hartley novel, is about England in the nineteen-twenties, about county aristocracy, about the cruelties of a class system that Hartley (who also wrote ""The Go-Between"") remembers with an outrage so tempered that it often seems a kind of fondness.Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) is recovering from a mild breakdown she suffered following the loss of her husband, a young Tory Member of Parliament for whose death she feels vaguely responsible. She was at a party when it happened. It? Probably a heart attack, though we never learn exactly. Lady Franklin wears sensible shoes and cardigans that droop almost to the floor. She doesn't much care what she looks like, but she knows she must take hold.In a hired limousine, a magnificent old Rolls-Royce, which takes her from the clinic to her mother's house in Bath, Lady Franklin engages the chauffeur in small talk. She talks to the back of his head, to one eye seen in a mirror. She tells him that people say things to one another but rarely make contact. He answers ""yes, my lady,"" because it's his style and because his customers are always right.When they arrive at her mother's and Leadbetter, which is the name of the chauffeur, gets out to open the door for Lady Franklin, the camera suddenly looks at him for the first time. Lead-better (Robert Shaw) is not just the back of a head, an eye and a uniform. He is a singular man, youngish, handsome, polite and, above all, calculating. Lady Franklin has been so invigorated by the depth of their communication that she engages Leadbetter to take her on a series of afternoon drives.Thus begins ""The Hireling,"" which is about the recovery of Lady Franklin and the misunderstanding that develops between the lady and the chauffeur. It's all very cool and precise and, to me, anyway, a bit less than entirely engrossing. The characters in Wolf Mankowitz's screen play simply aren't very interesting, despite a calm, intelligent performance by Miss Miles and an almost diabolical one by Shaw who, not really tragically, aspires to love above his station.For Lady Franklin's benefit, the unmarried Leadbetter fabricates a complete family for himself, with stories about two small children and a wife named Frances who looks at lot like her ladyship. Lady Franklin, in turn allows Leadbetter to think she fancies him. She insists on riding next to him in the front seat. She draws him out about his business as well as family affairs, and she even lends him money so that his Rolls won't be carried off by creditors.""The Hireling"" is very good in individual scenes, in the look of its landscapes, in its observation of manners and especially in its refusal to overexplain narrative details. However, by effectively reducing the conflicts within the English social order to a misunderstanding, It becomes not only silly but grossly misleading.The excellent supporting cast includes Peter Egan, as an ambitious young Liberal politician, who succeeds with Lady Franklin without half trying; Elizabeth Sellars, as Lady Franklin's mother, who is as self-absorbed as Lady Franklin will one day be, and Caroline Mortimer, as Egan's cast-off mistress.""The Hireling,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, shared the grand prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival with an American film, ""Scarecrow.""",1973-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Psycopath Does His Grim Deeds in 'Wicked, Wicked':The Cast","Titles tell you nothing. Just on the surface, ""Wicked, Wicked"" sounds like a slightly misbehaving nineteen-fifties sub-deb. Actually, it is the story of Jason (Randolph Roberts), a poor confused lad who works in a huge California resort hotel where he occasionally slices up the guests (preferably good-looking younger blondes) and then pieces their bodies back together, secretly preserving them as per instructions in his correspondence-school mortician's course. It is also the story of a hotel dick named Rick (David Bailey), and his lovely lady, Lisa (Tiffany Bolling), and the marvelous old monstrosity (Hotel del Coronado, in San Diego) where Rick detects and Lisa entertains and Jason clears away the customers.What distinguishes ""Wicked, Wicked"" from all other recent psychopathic-killers-loose-in-rambling-old-hotels movies is its gimmick. ""A unique projection process"" according the distributor, which calls it Duo-Vision. Duo-Vision is in fact nothing more than split-screen unremittingly applied, as in ""Chelsea Girls"" and ""Dionysus in '69,"" but never before with such winning simplicity of intention.By means of Duo-Vision we see: 1. two things at once, 2. two points of view on any one thing at once, 3. present action and flashbacks to past action at the same time, and 4.when there isn't much else going ona pop-eyed woman who plays spooky music on a big theater organ. Obviously, a big hotel full of rooms and corridors is a natural for multiple-screen projection. But not quite so obviously, the effect of such projection is to defuse the action.When you can see both the distant, stalking killer and his intended victim at the same time you have more activity but less anticipationand consequently less suspense. And the lifting of suspense, which in most such movies functions as an annoying burden upon the audience, is a very real advantage.""Wicked, Wicked"" thus emerges as an oddly pleasant movie about which there is not too much good to say. Everybody is likableeven the killer, who, like most amateur embalmers in movies for the last 10 years, owes a bit to Hitchcock's Norman Bates. And everybody is at least professionally competent.There should always be a place for the low-budget hotel movie, where the same six extras as guests continually crisscross the lobby and enjoy the show in the supper club, and where everything, from room service on up, has the attractively casual air of making do with the needs and opportunities of the moment.""Wicked, Wicked,"" written, produced, and directed by Richard Bare, opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.",1973-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'O Lucky Man!':English Comedy Tells of a Classic Innocent The Cast,"Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell), at heart, is literature's classic innocent. He is wide-eyed and tireless, and he is possessed by such sweetness of temper that arbitrary cruelties go unrecognized. Instead, unpleasant shocks are absorbed by an optimism that serves him as a kind of ship's fender, protecting him on all sides.However, unlike Candide, even unlike Evelyn Waugh's Paul Pennyfeather, Mick would hardly qualify for citizenship in any but the most haphazardly administered state of grace. Mick wants to succeed and he is willing to try just about anything to do it. His completely unfounded belief that he can succeed, that he will overcome all obstacles, becomes the badge that certifies his innocence. It is a second-rate sort of badge, like something out of a cereal box, and a second-rate sort of innocence, quite in keeping with the second-rate morality of the times we live in.""O Lucky Man!"", the new English comedy directed by Lindsay Anderson (his first since ""If . . ."") and written by his ""If . . ."" collaborator, David Sherwin, chronicles the adventures of Mick from his humble beginnings as a trainee-salesman at Liverpool's Imperial Coffee Company, through various good fortunes and outrageous disasters, until, at the end, Mick has a kind of Zen illumination. A light bulb goes on inside his head. He smiles broadly: He is, after all, alive.Mick has hobnobbed with international tycoons, scientists and politicians, and he's been double-crossed by all. He has also been nursed (quite literally) with the milk of human kindness by a vicar's wife. He has been thrown into jail for simply wanting to succeed (""And you failed!"" says the furious judge), and he's been rehabiliated (""Did you know you have eyes like Steve McQueen?"" asks a kindly warden).He has been seduced by a rapacious landlady, abandoned by a beautiful London debutante, tortured at anatomic research center (in the name of national security) and beaten up by vagrants he would have helped.""0 Lucky Man!"" clearly has a number of things on its mind, but as a movie, it is a very mixed bagBecause Mr. Anderson is much more bold and free as a director than Mr. Sherwin is inventive as a social satirist, ""O Lucky Man!"" always promises to be much more stimulating and funny than it ever is. Staying with it through its almost three-hour running time becomes increasingly nerve-racking, like watching superimposed images that never synchronize. The result does not match the ambition of the intention. The wit is too small, too perfunctory, for the grand plan of the film and the quality of the production itself.Every member of the castheaded by McDowell, Ralph Richardson, Rachel Roberts, Arthur Lowe and Helen Mirrenis superb, and there is something surprisingly appealing (both to one's theatrical sense and to the dramatic unity of the film) in having lots of the actors turn up in different roles throughout the chronicle.The real star, however, is Alan Price, best known here for ""The Animals,"" who wrote the film's fine score and sings at various intervals during the movie, either on the soundtrack or in scenes shot in a recording studio. The songs, which more or less punctuate the individual chapters of Mick's odyssey, provide the wit and sense of surprise that are lacking in Sherwin's screenplay. It is funny when Price sings cheerfully, ""Sell, sell, sellsell everything you stand for""when Mick starts out on the road, since Mick, quite obviously, stands for very little.The score exhibits real irony about the ghastly indecencies that Sherwin so ponderously tries to ridicule. In this day and age, for those of us who have grown up with the truly epic visions of film makers like Buuel and Chaplin, it's hardly enough for a film to qualify as ""serious"" or ""important"" by pointing out to us the excesses of capitalism, the awesomeness of technology gone mad, or even that poor people can act like beasts, just like rich people.A more disturbing proposition by far would be a film that might suggest that rampant capitalism and technological madness could possibly succeed, by some terrible fluke, in fulfilling their promises. That is something that would force us to rethink the clichs we liberals live by. ""O Lucky Man!"", which opened yesterday at Cinema I, is a kind of homage to those clichs.",1973-06-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Last of Sheila' Arrives at the Sutton:Murder Mystery Puts Fun Into Format The Cast Turns Search for' Killer Into a Cruise Game,"""The Last of Sheila,"" directed by Herbert Ross from an original screenplay by Stephen Sondheim and Anthony Perkins, is an old-fashioned murder mystery that has been dressed up fit to kill and set aboard a fine, white-hulled, teak-decked Mediterranean yacht of the sort that souls have been sold to obtain.The characters are Hollywood types who, by this time, must be as familiar to any woman who has ever spent a minute under a hair dryer as they are to people who read The Hollywood Reporter: the sadistic producer, the down-and-out director, the flesh-peddler (talent agent), the sex symbol, the ambitious writer, and so on. They are beautiful but edgy people, the kind who greet good jokes with a rating (""That's beautiful"") rather than laughter. For these people even casual conversation can be a form of competition. The wisecrack is the weapon.For as long as it runs, ""The Last of Sheila"" is also a good deal of fun, like one of those tricky, after-dinner party games that always seem dreary in advance but then somehow turn out to be more amusing than one had any right to expect.The movie is, quite literally, a game, one that has been set up by the producer (James Coburn) who, on the first anniversary of his wife's mysterious hit-and-run death, invites six friends for a week's cruise off the coast of southern France. Any one of the guests, it turns out (as it must in this sort of thing), could have had a motive for doing in Sheila, which is the name of the producer's wife as well as of the yacht.The format of the cruise is as strict as that of a television quiz show. Each guest has been given a slip of paper with a guilty secret written on it, a secret, it further turns out (as it must) that actually applies to one of the guests, though not the one who holds the paper. One is an alcoholic, one a child molester, one a homosexual, etc. They are, in short, just folks, and by the end of the week the host plans not only to have exposed each of them, but also to have his murderer.I'm not a great after-dinner game person and I must admit that at various points in ""The Last of Sheila"" my mind wandered from the clues, even though it's difficult to avoid noticing them. They are only slightly less inconspicuous than would be snowshoes around a swimming pool.Since I'm told that Sondheim and Perkins are serious game people, I assume that the plot, if run backward, would make sense. More important to me was the generally festive air in which all this genteel mayhem takes place, as well as the rather charming, Agatha Christie manners that are observed. As plot points are explained, people get themselves drinks from the bar. If someone is murdered, the pall of gloom lasts for a maximum of five minutes.No one takes himself seriously and the characters are a colorful though not a very nice lot. Beautiful people, after all, haven't got time to be nice.Most colorful is Dyan Cannon who plays the talent agent for all that the wisecracks are worth (""My mouth is so dry they could shoot 'Lawrence of Arabia' in it"" or ""I hate my luggage more than life itself""). It's not wit, but it's funny, and she gives a very good, very comic performance.The others are also good, especially Richard Benjamin and Joan Hackett (as the writer and his wife) and James Mason (as the failing director), but the essential bitchery that makes the film work is provided by Miss Cannon and by all of the Sondheim-Perkins inside referencesto things like pool maintenance, Joyce Haber and Hammer Films  which really are not too inside for us ordinary people to get.Perhaps the best thing about ""The Last of Sheila,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton, is that it never tries to convince us that its characters are not having fun. They enjoy having money, or having access to it. It makes murder, as well as life, more interesting.",1973-06-15T05:00:00+0000

And if John Hough, the director, and his small, willing cast maintain mild tension during their harried visit to this haunted ""hell house,"" the few chills they provide are of little help.The gloomy Victorian pile in question was once owned by a mysteriously departed, evil munitions tycoon, who filled it with those psychic phenomena.

And, if it can be called a switch, she plays a nurse who operates on bad scenes, bad guys and dolls, with explicit dialogue, but almost never in an operating room.Despite a good deal of lip service against the evils of drugs and the like, there's a maximum of footage devoted to exposing Miss Grier. She is plagued by problems. Her kid sister is hooked on drugs, so she uses a shotgun to dispatch a pusher. Then there's that bigtime white hood, Allan Arbus, who's muscled in on Robert DoQui, the black pimp and pusher. And there's Booker Bradshaw, her boyfriend and a politico in cahoots with the gang lords and cops who've maimed her admirer, William Elliott.What happens? She kills them all off, including her two-timing lover. All of which leaves a viewer with the happy thought that she now can get back to nursing and away from films like ""Coffy.""",1973-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: An Almost Sublime 'Interval Opens:Story of Love Comes to 34th St. East,"""Married?""""No""""Never?""""Not yet!"" . . . sigh . . . And so Serena Moore (Merle Oberon), as tremulous as any girl, parries the charming but too insistent German restaurateur who rescued her from her stalled car and has already fallen in love with her on the short drive from nowhere to the Mayan ruins at Chichen-Itza. She has come to the Yucatan, Serena Moore, in search of peace. And she has brought with her a gold-framed Romantic landscape painting, a 5 million-year-old fossil fish (""to put me in perspective""), a change of wardrobe for every occasion, and an unquenchable thirst for life.""It's so beautiful here,"" she exclaims, forging her way through a tropical rain forest, ""only one thought on its mindto grow!""Who could resist a lady like that? Nobody. Not the helpful German, nor the old rake at the bar, nor the handsome stranger on the beach, nor the teen-age boy on room servicebut, always graciously, Serena refuses them. Until Chris. Tempestuous, passionate, young, it is the vagrant artist Chris (Robert Wolders), also in search of peace, who awakens Serena's dormant fire and provides the occasion for ""Interval,"" the story of a woman who finally stops running from love. The film opened yesterday at the 34th Street East Theater.It is one of those ecstatic affairs, full of wonder and discovery, and yet it doesn't work. Perhaps Serena is just too fine, too sensitive. Perhaps it is something else. There is a problem, a silent traveler with Serena on her journeys, which I wouldn't bring up if the movie didn't keep bringing it upin whispers: ""The age thing."" Though it is the last thought on his mind, and though you could never tell from looking at her, at some point Chris has to admit that Serena iswell""over 40.""But truth to tell, Merle Oberon is well over 60, and from time to time it shows. ""Are you a statue or are you real?"" asks Chris, marveling at her beauty. You can't always say. Such uncanny freedom from wrinkles has not been achieved without a certain cost, and at this stage in her career Miss Oberon seems to have only two or three facial expressions left. Consequently, she acts mainly with her eyes, and with a small shake of her shoulders, which may be spunk, but which is never quite appropriate for the emotion of the moment. There was never such a movie for observing its leading lady from the back of the head.There probably was never such a movie for anything. As performed by Miss Oberon, directed by Daniel Mann, written by Gavin Lambert, with a musical score by Armando Manzanero and Ruben Fuentes that flows over everything like detergent back-up, the tragic tale of Serena Moore in ""Interval"" provides the first genuinely funny comedy of the year.On the scale of awfulness, it is almost sublime, better than ""Pope Joan,"" nearly as good as ""The Great Waltz.""

us,' Super Fly TNT' Continues With His Adventures in Rome and Africa:The Cast,"Coming after a fast, colorful movie like ""Super Fly,"" a follow-up called ""Super Fly TNT"" is a wet firecracker. Long on talk and short on action, this juiceless bundle comes close to being super dull. It opened yesterday, with Ron O'Neal repeating the protagonist role and also directing.Most of the time Priest, the reformed, cocaine pusher from Harlem simply slouches around Rome, as a tired, cynical expatriate, trailed by the loving Sheila Frazier, from the first film. He plays poker. Occasionally, the couple ride past Roman landmarks. Priest finally lets himself be persuaded to fly off to Africa on a gun-running mission for a small, oppressed country, and the picture ends just when it should be starting.The Africa of the climax is a feeble, low-budget simulation, with some brief, standard, travelogue footage, as Mr. O'Neal is yanked off a plane and sadistically beaten in a room that could be anywhere.One thing stands out like a small, personal lighthouse. This is the excellent performance of Roscoe Lee Brownestrong, dignified and piercingas an impassioned African revolutionary. His patient recruiting in Rome of Mr. O'Neal, who often looks bored to death, takes most of the picture. Sharing that patience requires real indulgence.",1973-06-16T05:00:00+0000

Geissendrfer's ""Jonathan,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, was first seen here last year when it was the most entertainingif not exactly the best  of the movies in the excellent New German Cinema show at the Museum of Modern Art. It is a vampire movie (Jonathan Harker, you may remember, is the principal narrator in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" an exceptionally classy vampire movie, and the distributor is billing it as the first anti-Fascist film of its kind.None of this gets so seriously into ""Jonathan"" as to spoil the fun. But when Professor Van Helsing complains (to a meeting of 19th-century Transylvanian student activists) that ""the power of these blood suckers increases every day,"" you can bet he's at least two-thirds of the way into political metaphor.But the quality of imagination behind the film is generally much better than this. You can see it in such inventions as the malicious dwarf who lives in the forest outside Count Dracula's estate and who collects the paraphernalia  crosses, wooden stakes, old sprigs of garlic  of fearless vampire killers who came before our hero, Jonathan, and failed. And you can see it in the disciplined troop of ethereal little girls who attend the vampires  not the brides of Dracula (they are there also), but perhaps the bridesmaids, or even the first communicants. For this Count Dracula, an anti-Christ of parts, not only takes blood but also gives it too  from a wound in his side which, with infinite sadness, he offers to the lips of his victims.Nothing else quite matches that gesture. Nothing ever matches the ritual of the first voluptuous kiss in any vampire movie, and ""Jonathan"" is especially cannythough very restrainedwith the erotic potential of its material. But the whole film is invested with a kind of solemnity that is sometimes terrifying (though never cheaply shocking) and sometimes silly, but that, on balance, makes it the most beautiful-looking vampire movie I have seen.Geissendrfer's camera glides  almost floats  through extremely long takes orchestrated to marvelously florid sequences of pans and tracks. The cast is huge (there is ultimately a veritable plague of vampires, and they decimate whole villages), the settings are unusual and very sumptuous. ""Jonathan"" doesn't really make movie history. But it substantially adds to one of the oddest and grandest traditions of recent popular art.",1973-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Paul Mazursky's 'Blume in Love':The Cast,"Paul Mazursky's ""Blume in Love"" is an oddly affecting comedy about a successful Los Angeles divorce lawyer named Blume (George Segal) who is hopelessly in love with his ex-wife, Nina (Susan Anspach). Nina is pretty and almost painfully thin, and she approaches her social work, her yoga and her status as a newly liberated woman with such humorless determination that it's difficult to understand what Blume ever saw in her. That, however, is very much a part of the mystery and the mood of the comedy.The air is chilly, but the sun is warm as Blume wanders around Venice, mostly around the Piazza San Marco, remembering what happened in Southern California in more or less chronological sequence. Not always. He remembers his honeymoon with Nina in Venice before he remembers their meeting at a fund-raising party for lettuce pickers. He even remembers things he didn't see, such as Nina's first encounter with Elmo (Kris Kristofferson), an out-of-work musician who seeks welfare aid from Nina and winds up living with her.Blume is at loose ends, which is virtually the style of a film that is composed of flashbacks. Blume is haunted, sometimes hilariously, by memories of Nina, by memories of his own postdivorce impotence and his visits to an analyst (the same analyst who was in ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice""), and by memories of life in Southern California.More than anything else, perhaps, ""Blume in Love"" is a Southern California movie, to such an extent that Mazursky can't resist the temptation to recall Visconti's film version of ""Death in Venice"" as a rueful background gag while Blume wanders through Venice. It's not terribly funny, but it somehow seems appropriate to Mazursky, a very bright film maker who seems torn between a desire to be hip and a need to ridicule the kind of fraudulent hipness he identifies with life in Southern California.There has been this contradiction in all of Mazursky's films so farin ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas,"" which he wrote in collaboration with Larry Tucker, as well as in ""Bob & Carol"" and ""Alex in Wonderland,"" both of which he directed from scripts written with Tucker.""Blume in Love,"" his first solo effort as writer, director and producer, strikes me as being by far his most interesting film to date, a little too self-absorbed and smart-mouthed for its own good, like Blume, but intelligent and full of healthy disrespect and energy.These are also the qualities of Segal's performance as Blume, the sort of man who takes terrible risks for things that aren't worth risks. The divorce, for example, is prompted by the fact that he was caught when, instead of taking his secretary to a motel for an afternoon affair, he took her to his house. Blume's life is full of such suicide substitutes.Miss Anspach's Nina, who begins as such a touchy character, eventually becomes conventionally sweet, not, I suspect, because Mazursky really understands her but because the film has a conventionally comic shape. Kristofferson, so ill at ease in Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,"" is most relaxed and debonnaire as the musician, and Mazursky himself is extremely funny as Segal's uptight law partner.I also very much liked Shelley Winters in the brief role of a tearful wife who wants a divorce as well as the house, the children, the beach house, the Jaguar and all the money.""Blume in Love"" is a restless, appealing, sometimes highly comic contemporary memoir. It opened yesterday at the Tower East.",1973-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: And Now It's 'Shaft in Africa':Roundtree on Track of a Labor Smuggler,"When Gordon Parks's ""Shaft"" opened here two years ago, Vincent Canby praised it in the Sunday New York Times for recalling an almost lost tradition: the good Saturday night movie. A lot of people must have agreed. We are now into the third installment of John Shaft's adventures. But if the original ""Shaft"" was Saturday night, the latest sequel, John Guillermin's ""Shaft in Africa,"" has become by some benign process, inescapably Saturday afternoon. It is still goodquite surprisingly goodfairly violent and very sexy. But it is less daring, less ethnically sophisticated, more antiseptic, more comfortably middle-class. Having left his West Village pad, Shaft now lives in a luxury high-rise at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street. It is here that representatives of an emergent African nation begin to persuade him (kidnap is a better word) to use his unmatchable talents to break up a sinister ring smuggling cheap illegal labor out of Africa and into the factories, the construction sites, the road gangs of Paris.So Shaft leaves his native wilderness (Manhattan) and is spirited to Addis Ababa, where he sets out on a mission that seems designed to benefit French labor unions more than black workersthough a certain dimness in the plotting has never bothered movies of this nature. Shaft will pose as an ignorant job-seeking tribesman and go the whole route, by foot, by camel, by ship and by truck, to unmask the master criminal behind this 20th-century black servitude.As Shaft, Richard Roundtree remains among the most attractive of recent movie actors. As an African tribesman he looks about as indigenous as, say, during the nineteen-thirties heyday of filmed colonialism, Ralph Richardson might have looked if gotten up with blackface in order to infiltrate the Fuzzy Wuzzies. In either case, you give up authenticity in favor of more dramatic virtues.Of the two women in Shaft's current life, Vonetta McGee, here the daughter of Shaft's employer, the Emir of Kemant, is a well-known, well-admired personality. Neda Arneric, an exciting, very young Yugoslav actress, plays Jazar, a sensuous beauty with a taste for everybody, including Shaft, who makes her happy before she dies.She is the mistress of Amafi (Frank Finlay), the smugglers' leader, and her death occasions a brief and curiously gentle exchange of regrets between him and Shaftthe kind of gallantry that sometimes enters action movies and complicates them in surprising and wholly gratifying ways. Mr. Guillermin's direction has never pleased me before, but I like it here for its economy, its generally serviceable professionalism.""Shaft in Africa"" opened yesterday at the Cinerama and RKO 86th Street Twin 2 theaters.",1973-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Segal and Glenda Jackson Star in 'A Touch of Class':The Cast,"Steve Blackburn (George Segal) is an American insurance executive living in London with his wife and two children. Vicki Allessio (Glenda Jackson) is a high-voltage young Englishwoman who successfully pirates Paris fashions for New York's Seventh Avenue. She has two children but is separated from her Italian husband who lives in Milan. ""He'd send me money for the children,"" she says, ""if I sent him money for the cars.""Steve and Vicki meet in a manner that Hollywood writers used to call cute. He's playing softball in the park and almost tramples her son trying to catch a fly ball. Steve and Vicki trade rebukes and after two more meetings, they are preparing to have an affair in Marbella. ""It'll probably do us both a world of good,"" says Steve, although he throws his back out of joint on their arrival in Spain and the next night they are throwing lamps at each other while a comic desk clerk is pleading: ""Is this any way to treat a hotel?""Melvin Frank's ""A Touch of Class"" is a very patchy movieenormously funny in bits and pieces and sometimes downright dumb. When the material matches their intelligence, Segal and Miss Jackson are extremely funny lovers, as on their first night when they find themselves lying in bed, each on his (or her) ""wrong"" side, arguing about how they will change locations with a minimum of fuss.There are also some fine farcical scenes more or less dedicated to the proposition that maintenance of a love nest is, at best, full of peril. On one occasion, after Steve has left his house telling his wife he is going to walk the dog, he returns home unaccompanied. In a transport of illicit joy he has left the dog with Vicki.Steve and Vicki obviously are perfectly matched, sharing not only the star billing of Segal and Miss Jackson, but also a common fondness for the excitement to be found in periodic domestic rough-house. Steve's wife (Hildegard Neil) seems to be a frigid bore and Vicki's life alone is certainly unrewarding. They were made for each other.However, Mr. Frank, who directed the film, and his collaborator on the screenplay, Jack Rose, will not let the characters alone. They keep forcing them into awkward attitudes. To set up the kind of laughs the film wants, the Segal character is asked to behave like such an idiot he wouldn't know second gear from third, which has the effect of turning Miss Jackson's Vicki into a wisecracking shrew.The problem, I suspect, is that ""A Touch of Class"" is a remodeled comedy out of the nineteen-forties, when it was written in Hollywood (in the old Production Code) that adultery was tabu. Adultery must not be consummated, but it was O.K. as long as it was being constantly interrupted. It's not adultery that gets interrupted in ""A Touch of Class,"" but the natural instincts of two supposedly sophisticated people.This may be taking ""A Touch of Class"" more seriously than most audiences looking for easy laughs will care to. Others may share my feeling that there is something contradictory about a contemporary comedy that wishes to tell us that adultery is simply not worth the effort, even though the partners are so clearly in love. The ending is not sad, only a bit fraudulent.Somehow I expect more of a movie that can contain a desperately funny defense of an American mother who, though the family was not rich, saw to it that her children always had fresh grape-fruit in winter and were the first on their block to own electric blankets.",1973-06-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Simplicity Marks Soviet Films in Festival:Five Premieres Held at Little Carnegie Collective-Farm Tale Is Among Features,"A brief festival of new Russian moviesfive feature-film premieres, a kids' film and a revival of Andrei Smirnov's ""Byelorussian Station""played last week at the Little Carnegie Theater in a program meant to tie in with Leonid I. Brezhnev's visit to the United States. The films are scheduled for further showings in this country, possibly for commercial distribution. Two have been dubbed into English; the rest, mercifully, are subtitled.They are presented as representing a cross section of recent Soviet film making. I suspect they do represent certain aspects of popularly accepable Russian film making, and for people whose idea of the Soviet cinema has been formed by ""Potemkin,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" ""The Lady With the Little Dog"" or even ""Ballad of a Soldier,"" the new movies may come as a discouraging surprise.Consider the story of Aleksei Sakharov's ""In His Right Place"": Semyon, a young engineer, gets himself elected chairman of his collective farm. He believes in much work and no wasted time. He does not believe in smoking, drinking or miniskirtsand neither does the film. He proposes many changes with a view to modernizing the collective. At first the older people oppose him, but eventually they see the light, and the young chairman succeeds.Or consider the story of Oleg Bondaryev's ""The Stepmother"": When Pavel, who maintains and operates machinery on a collective farm, learns that a woman he was once in love with has diedleaving behind a little girl who is, in fact, his daughterhis good wife, Shura, agrees to take the child in and to become her stepmother. At first the child is mistrustful and withdrawn; but eventually Shura's goodness and maternal warmth win her over, and the stepmother succeeds.I've left out a lot. The films are full (but not too full) of humanizing and individualizing details. Some of the performancessuch as Tatyana Doronina's as the plump, good-natured, perpetually flustered, slightly dimwitted stepmotherare very expert. But despite the details and the performances, these are films of an almost numbing simplicity. They are exactly the ""realism"" that might do for edification in some ideally placated society. And compared with other East European cinemascompared with what we have seen over the last few years, say, from Yugoslavia, from Hungary, even from Bulgariathey are film making at a kindergarten level of cultural awareness and dramatic sophistication.Two of the Russian movies are escapist entertainment. Vladimir Motyl's ""White Sun of the Desert"" is a picaresque adventure, involving the heroic exploits of a Red Army soldier in the insufficiently socialized wilds of Turkestan. Leonid Gaidai's ""Ivan Vassilyevich Changes His Profession"" suggests what might happen if, by means of a time machine, Ivan the Terrible were suddenly to find himself in 20th-century Moscow, while two 20th-century Muscovites were, taking Ivan's place in medieval Russia.With the kind of madcap comedy idea that withers the imagination even before it hits the screen, ""Ivan Vassilyevich"" is of interest mainly for its director's unflagging devotion to the assumption that rapid-motion photography is always funny, for the graffiti that show up on Moscow apartment-building walls (extensive, but still preaerosol-spray-can) and for the intimations of luxury in middle-class urban life. Convertibles, cameras, tape recorders, black-market transistorsthe film is a small-scale homage to conspicuous consumption.The best of the films also ostensibly the most officiala long semidocumentary called ""The Taming of Fire."" Written and directed by Edward Smirnov and Miss Doronina (the stepmother is also a scenarist), it concerns a pioneering space scientist who suffers a heart attack and then, hovering between life and death, immediately has a 2-hour-and-20-minute flashback covering the entire history of Soviet rocket development from the beginnings to the present.There are interesting sidelights, such as the shooting down of Francis Gary Powers's U-2 spy plane in 1960, or the exploding of a Soviet nuclear bomb (justified on the grounds, more or less, that the Americans already have it, and the only language those people understand is force). But the movie really comes alive with its rocketry and with its exotic and marvelously theatricaland, I assume, authenticspace hardware.Unfortunately the dialogue is English-dubbed, and, through the universal alchemy of dubbing studios, it has been transformed into 50 per cent non sequiturs. But from what I can make out, ""The Taming of Fire"" is not wholly enamored of state science or hard work or success. It even sees its great scientist (quite well played by Kirill Lavrov) as something of a dedicated monster and all of Moscow's honors as a rather paltry substitute for life. In the context of Soviet cinema week, this seems like the stirring of some real air to breathe.",1973-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,' The Friends of Eddie Coyle' Is a Good Tough Movie,"Peter Yate's ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle,"" adapted by Paul Monash from the George V. Higgins novel, is a good, tough, unsentimental movie about the last days of a small-time Boston hood.Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a guy who knows his place. Once he didn't. Once he bought some guns for some associates, and when the guns were traced to those associates, the associates of the associates took Eddie aside and broke all the knuckles on one hand. There was nothing personal. Eddie could undetrstand how they felt.Now Eddie is getting old, not like most movie gangster heros, with grandeur, but with desperation. He's facing a two-year sentence in New Hampshire for driving a truck that carried stolen whisky. He has no money in the bank and his wife and children will probably have to go on welfare.Eddie was never one to think big. He let the other guys do that. He buys stolen guns for the guys who pull the bank jobs, and at night he goes home to the wife and kids or, sometimes, to a hockey game.Eddie is not very imaginative, and he's not a tragic hero, but as played by Mitchum he has wit and a certain dignity. In the end, even the dignity is taken away from him.""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" is so beautifully acted and so well set (in and around Boston's pool halls, parking lots, side-streets, house trailers and barrooms) that it reminds me a good deal of John Huston's ""Fat City."" It also has that film's ear for the way people talkfor sentences that begin one way and end another, or are stuffed with excess pronouns. ""What you don't know, it don't bother you,"" a friend might say to Eddie.Unlike ""Fat City,"" however, ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" is interested in plot and narrative suspense. The film splits its attention between Eddie, as he slowly evolves into a stool pigeon in an effort to stay free, and the more or less conventional caper movie sequences that show us how to rob a bank. Mr. Yates (""Bullitt"") is so good at this sort of thing that it's probably difficult to resist putting it in.There's nothing wrong with it, but it does diminish the impact of Eddie's story, which could have been quite special.Giving Mitchum excellent support are Peter Boyle, as a bartender who deals in larceny and contract murder on the side, and Richard Jordan, as a young detective who looks deceptively soft, talks much like the hoods he is tracking, and is genuinely fascinated by the game he must play with them.The detective's manner with Eddie is direct, absolutely straight, but he is always pushing him. ""You help uncle, uncle will help you,"" he tells Eddie. It's fairly typical of everything that's wrong in Eddie's life, that when he decides to turn in several associates he is 12 hours too late. Someone else squealed before he could.""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" opened yesterday at the National and Cinema II Theaters.",1973-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Live and Let Die' Opens:The Latest James Bond Fights Heroin Ring,"Torchlight, Voodoo drums. Dark bodies writhe in the mounting frenzy of some unspeakable tropical rite. Suddenly a door is flung open and framed within it stands a beautiful white girl held captive by two monstrous black men. Her filmy white gown scarcely covering the soft contours of her body, she is dragged  protesting  to a crude scaffold and there is tied fast.As if by signal, the ranks of jeering celebrants open and there advances an executioner, laughing, stomping, hideously costumed. He holds a poisonous snake in his outstretched hands, a snake whose bite is destined for the smooth young bosom. . . .Whatever the quality of this little scenario, you must admit that to stick it into a movie these days takes nerve. Merely to make a new adventure movie in which all the bad guys are black and almost all the good guys are white, and which includes in its climax the (near) sacrifice of a (recent) virgintakes nerve.Nerve, and certain insolence toward public pieties, and a lot of canniness about just what level of sophistication its audience is up toall of them qualities that have characterized the James Bond movies since the beginning, 10 years ago, and that abundantly characterize the latest, Guy Hamilton's ""Live and Let Die.""There are now eight Bond movies, and though they are the work of many different talents (Hamilton has directed two previously: ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"") they do represent a recognizable tradition in which the wholeor the memory of the whole  seems to be greater than the sum of the parts.The plots tend to flow into each otherone scheme after another for controlling all the money in the worldchanging their elements to fit changing anxieties (in ""Live and Let Die"" the evil is a heroin monopoly operating out of some Caribbean island kingdom with pipelines into New York City and New Orleans), but remaining the same in essence.And always there is a woman waiting to be converted by the power of sex. In ""Live and Let Die"" she reads the Tarot pack to tell fortunes for the enemy. James Bond's card keeps coming up ""Lovers,"" though she thinks she is hoping for ""Death.""There are three chases (four, if you stretch a point), including one by car and motorboat that gets so complicated it allows for character development. One actor, Clifton James, who appears only during the chase, gets fourth billing in the cast list.The names above Mr. James's do not seem so impressive. Roger Moore is a handsome, suave, somewhat phlegmatic James Bondwith a tendency to throw away his throwaway quips as the minor embarrassments that, alas, they usually are.As Solitaire, to whom the cards speak truth only so long as she remains a virgin, Jane Seymour is beautiful enough, but too submissive even for this scale of fantasy. Yaphet Kotto (Dr. Kananha), a most agreeable actor, simply does not project evil.However, I could list compensating virtues by the score. There is a marvelous escape from an alligator farm (deadly reptiles are rather a motif in this movie), a superb collection of grotesque ways of killing, and a fine sense of pace and rhythm. ""Live and Let Die"" has been especially well photographed and edited, and it makes clever and extensive use of its good title song, by Paul and Linda McCartney.""Live and Let Die"" opened yesterday at several local theaters.",1973-06-28T05:00:00+0000

us,"' Playtime' a Funny Film, And Tati's Most Brilliant:The Cast","""Playtime,"" which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is Jacques Tati's most brilliant film, a bracing reminder in this all-too-lazy era that films can occasionally achieve the status of art.""Playtime"" is a gloriously funny movie about a Paris so modern it does not yet exist, a Paris composed entirely of streets like our Avenue of the Americas, hemmed in by efficiently beautiful glass-and-steel towers in which, if we are quick about it, we may see momentary reflections of Sacre Coeur, the Arch of Triumph or the Eiffel Tower.It is a city inhabited almost entirely by tourists and their shepherd-guides who are spreading a terrible pox among the natives. It is not an immediately fatal disease but it makes everyone behave with the kind of frigid competence affected by air-line stewardesses and reservation clerks.Not even nuns are immune. Their heels click importantly as they glide across marbleized floors. A receptionista man so ancient that he could be a veteran of Verdunoperates a complex of computer buttons designed to announce a visitor's arrival in an office building. The old man does his best and the machine bleeps and gurgles successfully. It is the world of Kubrick's ""2001"" without the metaphysics and without Richard Strauss.""Playtime,"" which was made in 1967 and is only now being released in this country, is Tati's most free-form comedy to date, as well as his most disciplined, even more so than ""Traffic,"" which was made in 1971 but was seen here last winter.It is virtually three major set pieces, or acts. The first act is set at Orly Airport, where we pick up some American tourists who arrive in a single, all-expenses-paid clump. The second is more or less devoted to a trade fair, where the tourists cross paths with Tati's Mr. Hulot.The last act, a kind of neon-lit Gotterdammerungis set in a posh nightclub whose opening night turns into the sort of chaos that civilizes. Everything goes wrong, including the air-conditioning, but in going wrong, life is somehow restored to the tourists as well as the natives.You may well recognize the shape of the film, which is a variation on the favorite comedy theme about the family that inherits a lot of money, tries to put on fancy airs, loses it soul, and only finds itself again when the fortune is taken away.However, it is not the shape of the film or its cheerful philosophy that are important. Rather it is the density of the wit. It is the gracefulness of the visual gags that flow one into another, non-stop, in a manner that only Tati now masters.Mr. Hulot is still the nominal focal point of the comedy, particularly in the trade-fair sequence, but he is less in evidence in ""Playtime"" than in any other Hulot feature. The film is even further removed from character than was ""Traffic."" It observes not persons, but social clusters, in a manner that serves curiously to humanize group action and response instead of to dehumanize the individual.However, don't waste time analyzing ""Playtime"" too much. It can easily withstand such critical assaults, but they serve to distract attention from the film's immense good humor, from, for example, the closing sequence that shows us a Parisian traffic circle that has been turned into a giant lazy Susan, serving, among other things, the sacred cause of inefficiency.In addition to everything else, ""Playtime"" is a reckless act of faithby Tati in himself. He photographed it in 70-mm (though it is being shown here in 35-mm), and he invested not only huge amounts of time in it, but also his own money. As anyone connected with films can tell you, this is certifiable madness.The movie business is supposed to exist so that people other than its artists can lose their shirts in it, thereby to gain things that are called (by those who can use them) tax-loss carry-forwards. I hope ""Playtime"" will make Tati very rich so that at some future time he can use a tax-loss carry-forward.",1973-06-28T05:00:00+0000

But it's hard for me to conceive of a Jewish boy from Brook lyn making it this way. From Manhattan I would have un derstood it easier.

He didn't indicate he was upset at being left off t he enemies list, but I have my suspicions.Now that I've made this list I have no more ambi tions in life. How do you top Public Enemy Number One? The first thing I did was call my mother in Florida and as sure her it was a good list. She wasn't sure if it was a good list or a bad list, and I assured her it was a good one.Maxwell Dane, retired chairman of the advertising firm of Doyle, Dane and Bernhach, was cited for his firm's work.

us,Film: 'Charley and Angel':The Cast,"""Cinderella,"" the cartoon-revival half of a current Walt Disney package, is far and away the better part of yesterday's double-bill at the Guild and Quad I Theaters. Wise parents will time it so that the youngsters see this treat first. The new live-action comedy, ""Charley and the Angel,"" can be taken as a tame, friendly caboose.The only real fun, judging by audience squeals at the Guild, is the finale, involving some wildly-flapping old flivver cars, as Fred MacMurray tries to rescue his two young sons from gangster-bootleggers. The kids loved this careening chaos. Otherwise, they had to settle for spurts of familiar trick photography, as a natty ""angel"" popped in to remind Mr. MacMurray, a stodgy business man, that he wasn't getting any fun out of life.Otherwise, nothing much happens. The picture, set in the Depression years, has a mildly diverting facade of nostalgia in costumes, tunes and those fine, tacky old cars. Mr. MacMurray, by now a Disney veteran, is front and center, unremittingly wide-eyed.Little sparkle or wit is accorded as appealing a family as any papa could wish. But Cloris Leachman as his wife, Kathleen Coty, Vincent Van Patten and little Scott Kolden do pleasantly by humdrum material. The same goes for Harry Morgan as the wry visitor from above, young Kurt Russell and, very minutely, Barbara Nichols.Master Kolden wedges in on bright, morning-after breakfast line after Mr. MacMurray is picked up, sipping lemonade, during a mild-looking roadhouse raid by police. ""Hey, Pop,"" he chirps, ""how was it in the clink?"" The rest, until that chase, is pretty much milk and crackers.",1973-06-28T05:00:00+0000

School tuna to 20 pounds are also plentiful in the same area, and fluke fishing is excellent offshore. Good numbers of stripers are being caught north and south of Barnegat Inlet about a mile offshore, although the fish are small, 4 to 8 pounds. Weakfishing has apparently ended, but crabbing in the bay is excellent. At Point Pleasant, boats are bringing in fair to good catches of fluke. Daytime blue fishing off Barnegat Ridge is excellent as is night fishing for the same species about 10 miles eastsoutheast of Manasquan Inlet. Stripers are scarce. Colvin's Bait and Tackle at Seaside Park, N. J., reports very poor surf fishing but fair to good angling in the bay for weakfish and small fluke. Many very small stripers are being taken in Barnegat inlet and, just offshore of the inletclose, but out of reach of surfcastersthere have been many small and medium sized bluefish caught.",1973-06-29T05:00:00+0000

The blandness of the project renders everyone invisible.Liv Ullmann plays Ann Stanley, a Manhattan real-estate agent with a pool-playing daughter of 17 (Deborah Raffin), a madcap mother (Binnie Barnes) and a charming ex-husband (Gene Kelly) who acts in TV pilots and coffee commercials. Ann is successful and tranquil but unfulfilled.On a holiday in Greece, Ann meets personable, presentable Peter Latham (Edward Albert) when her car breaks down in front of a view of the Gulf of Saronikos. Peter, 22, offers her a lift on his motorcycle. Ann refuses, pointing out she is 36. Instead, he gives her some ouzo, which, strangely, she has never heard of, even though she has been junketing around Greece for weeks. One thing leads to another, and Ann and Peter spend an idyllic night together on the beach.Back in Manhattan, Peter wants to marry Ann. She refuses. She's lied to him, she admits. She's not 36 but 38, well, actually 40? The way Ann vacillates, you get the idea she sees herself as a female Humbert Humbert. Should she or should she not? Will love triumph? ""Don't think of them as years,"" suggests her charming ex-husband, ""but carats. You're a multi-careted, blue-white diamond!"" As one drama critic said of the play with admiration, the movie doesn't cop out.It doesn't do much of anything. It just sits there, like a piece of expensively upholstered furniture.The women wear a lot of fancy gowns and trade wisecracks, only one of which, spoken by that fine comedienne, Nancy Walker, made me laugh. Gene Kelly gives the impression that he might still be as charming as we all remember him in ""Singing in the Rain."" Edward Albert, who made his debut in ""Butterflies Are Free,"" has a very spruce appearance.Miss Ullmann, however, is utterly lost. This marvelous actress, the world's most beautiful woman in Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers,"" looks like a 33-year-old frump, not a 40-year-old beauty. She is, I suspect, constitutionally incapable of dealing with this sort of nonsense in anything except the rather somber manner of a concerned night nurse in a charity ward. It seems she wants to help but she can't.Milton Katselas directed the movie and Leonard Gershe wrote the screenplay. They've succeeded in disguising the fact that it is basically a stage play, but not the fact that the material is hopelessly dumb.",1973-06-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:' Operation Leontine' Is French Caper Film,"Michel Audiard's ""Operation Leontine,"" which opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, is a heavily artificial comic-caper movie about an aged French queen of crime (Franoise Rosay) who temporarily leaves her retirement to outwit, outmurder, and outsteal all the hottest talent in Parisincluding her own fast-thinking, two-timing young niece (Marlene Jobert). There is a story behind all this, but it is of no account, and since the film doesn't care about it, neither shall I.What the film does care about is some not terribly exalted notion of cinema styleor stylishnesswhich it does its endless, agonizing, suffocating, unfunny best to exploit. In the early nineteen-sixties it was fashionable among second- and third-rank French directors to make movies that were archly self-conscious of the medium, and it is to this tradition, 10 years out of date, that ""Operation Leontine"" belongs. It is the kind of film in which characters spend almost as much time talking to the camera as they do to each otherthus presuming on a bond of audience sympathy that has not been earned and therefore does not exist.Michel Audiard is well-known as a writer (not director) of popular film comedies, and Franois Rosay's career covers literally the entire history of the French sound filmso there is a degree of professionalism in ""Operation Leontine"" that seems to belie the absolute dullness of everything that shows on the screen. But the dullness is real and the professionalism, a waste. Movies at precisely this level make me long for fresh air and sunlight, and perhaps immersion in the 19th-century novel.Richard Sarafian's ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"" is set in the post-Civil War West and is about a former Army officer-turned-train robber (Burt Reynolds) who was once married to an Indian girl named Cat Dancing. Hence the title. It's also about the high-born lady (Sarah Miles) whom he apparently liberates when he teaches her how to cook and make love.Most of the movie is a desultory chase: the officer-gentleman-train robber, the woman and some outlaws (including Jack Warden) in the lead, pursued by a sherif (Lee J. Cobb), the woman's husband (George Hamilton) and a posse. When one of the lesser outlaws gets fresh with Miss Miles, Jack Warden kicks him in the groin. When Mr. Warden rapes Miss Miles, Mr. Reynolds shoots him in the groin. When Miss Miles asks Mr. Reynolds why two people fall in love, he answers: ""I dunno. I suppose it's like two drops of rain that fall together and become one.""The film's poetry is as numbing as its violence.""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"" is, indeed, a kind of festival of incompetence. Each shot is held slightly too long or too short, and is somehow off-center. Each performance is uncertain, like something seen in an early rehearsal. Even the Indians look fake, including good old Jay Silverheels, who is real.The screenplay, based on Marilyn Durham's novel, is by Eleanor Perry (""David and Lisa,"" ""Diary of a Mad Housewife""), who can do much, much better.",1973-06-29T05:00:00+0000
