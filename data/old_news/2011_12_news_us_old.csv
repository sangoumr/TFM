Her back is well muscled. Her legs are girlish  shapely and short. Her skin is as weathered as a crocodile handbag. Her arms are covered with jellyfish scars. When Nyad swims in a pool, she counts in her head, ticking off laps, first in English, then in German, then in Spanish, then in French. (Nyad is fluent in all but German.) The goal is to focus her mind on repetitive thought, as a yogi does with a mantra. But when Nyad swims in the ocean for a long time  8 or 10 or 12 or even 24 hours  she doesnt just count, she sings. Shell do It Aint Me, Babe 10 times, interspersed with the quatralingual counting, then sing Paperback Writer, 10 times, followed by quatralingual counting again. Nyad keeps in her head a playlist of 65 songs. Some are for daytime swimming; others for nighttime. Nyad knows each one intimately, how many seconds each takes, how many strokes. When I complete 2,000 It Aint Me, Babes, Bob Dylan version, I know Ive gone 4 hours and 45 minutes exactly, Nyad says. I never lose track.",2011-12-01T10:00:14+0000

She sashayed into arty endeavor  working on books about architecture and photography, directing a documentary on concepts of heaven  without waxing aloof. She rode out the age thing (shes 65) that all female stars face, with minimum humiliation. And shes been self-sufficient. She forthrightly says, I never found a home in the arms of a man.

An admired Shakespeare scholar (as well as the author of a kind of precursor to this new book called The Dream of the Moving Statue), he moves in Puppet way out there beyond mere scholarship. There are myriad internal references (as Susan Stewart suggests), back-of-the-book footnotes and a generous bibliography, yet Gross rises serenely above his apparatus, shaping his own vision. He dreams and muses, offering endless insights into the strange and archaic world of puppets, inanimate things breathed to life. This is a book of literary mysticism, rich with accrued culture yet never weighed down by it. Its a summation of what Gross calls the vast literature about puppets, yet never didactic or preachy. It makes arguments and tells stories about wildly diverse puppet traditions, but it can also be dipped into like a book of poetry, savored for its lapidary insights on every page.",2011-12-02T19:54:30+0000

The Disney/ABC Television Group said that Vicki Dummer, ABCs senior vice president for current series and specials, would take over Mr. Fronss responsibilities for daytime programming. The soap opera General Hospital and talk shows like The View will be incorporated into Times Square Studios, a division of the ABC/Disney Television Group that will manage and create daytime and syndicated shows. Ms. Dummers title will be executive vice president of Times Square Studios. General Hospital, which has an uncertain fate as ABCs remaining soap opera, looks like the odd one out at Times Square Studios: a news release on Friday said the division would mostly develop nonscripted lifestyle and health programming. Along with The View, it will manage the two shows that are replacing the soap operas  The Chew and The Revolution  as well as the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Katie Courics forthcoming syndicated talk show. The Chew, which features a panel of five chefs and foodies who cook and drink and chat, began in September in place of All My Children; The Revolution, described by ABC as a talk show about health and lifestyle transformations, is to begin in January in place of One Life to Live. Mr. Frons has headed the daytime hours of ABC since 2002.

The stumble played into the image that the candidate, Enrique Pea Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, has tended more to his looks than his books.

DNA evidence showed that the man,  Thomas Haynesworth, could not have committed the crimes in which such evidence had been preserved, and it pointed to another man. Gov. Bob McDonnell released Mr. Haynesworth on parole in March, but Mr. Haynesworth petitioned for full exoneration. Prosecutors in the counties where the assaults occurred supported his effort, as did the commonwealths attorney general, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli. The Court of Appeals initially heard the appeal and then asked for further briefs. Shawn Armbrust, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, said, After serving nearly 27 years for crimes that he didnt commit, Mr. Haynesworth has had to register as a sex offender and abide by degrading conditions while the Court of Appeals took nearly nine months to conclude that the attorney general and the prosecutors were right that Mr. Haynesworth didnt commit these crimes.

The studded peep-toe booties, satin flats, polka-dot platforms and bow-embellished kitten heels carry many of the brands signatures, but share none of them collectively. What all of the shoes do share is a handwritten time stamp  a numerical record of the amount of time it took to make each pair. For example, the sequence etched into a pair of silver chain wedge heels is 47.4150, denoting 47 hours, 41 minutes and 50 seconds. When we talk about luxury and time, its clear that theres a strong connection between the two, says Maria Grazia Chiuri, one of the houses two co-designers. Time is the new luxury, and luxury does not exist without time and the consciousness of a unique tradition. Classic Italian craftsmanship still exists (Valentino is known for its old Florentine factories), but in an age of fast everything its easy to forget our Old World cobblers: the one devoted to flowers, the one who specializes in crystals and another with expertise in lace, for example. Pierpaolo Piccioli, Chiuris design partner, adds, Its nice to know that youre buying a kind of cultural process. Milled plexiglass and velvet wedges marked 38H?

It is not the first time Mr. Boyle has chosen Mr. Smith and Mr. Hyde to provide the soundtrack for one of his projects. The group is perhaps best known for its dance track Born Slippy, which first appeared in a scene from Mr. Boyles 1996 film Trainspotting. Since then, they have created music for four other projects by Mr. Boyle, including a National Theater production of Frankenstein that received high praise from critics. Mr. Boyle said the hiring of Underworld to write music for the Games was the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle and praised the duos creative range. Mr. Hyde said the chance to compose for the Olympics was a great honor.

In fact, in recent years, the designer, who is now in his 70s, has probably had as many runway presentations as museum exhibitions, including the one that opens this weekend at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands. Azzedine Alaa in the 21st Century focuses solely on his output from roughly the past decade, and yet there is more substance there than many designers could ever hope to achieve in a lifetime, including the fierce tailcoat above and a toothsome evening dress with a zipper that spirals suggestively around the body from the neck to the floor. Always the perfectionist in the pursuit of beauty (hes often referred to as a sculptor of womens bodies), Alaa apparently recut or totally remade many of the pieces in the show to the exact proportions of the mannequins. In an open love letter to the designer, Mark Wilson, who curated the exhibition, writes, Im sure that certain people may wonder why we are doing this one more time? referring to a massive Alaa exhibition at the Groninger Museum back in in 1997-98.

Some children were later adopted by foreigners, Caixin reported. Experts say the kidnapping and sale of children is a problem in China because of the countrys one-child policy and the cultural preference among many parents for boys. Families in many areas are fined heavily if they have more than one child and refuse to give up the others, and some officials have abducted children from such families.

us,"A Vision of Dance, Preserved in 3-D","PINA is a dance movie like no other. This documentary, by Wim Wenders, focuses on the German choreographer Pina Bausch and her company Tanztheater Wuppertal, but in a disarming twist it uses 3-D technology to take audiences inside the artists universe. Its an immersive experience that at moments makes viewers feel as if they were dancing too. The film, one of 15 on the shortlist for the best documentary feature Oscar, was in the works when Bausch died unexpectedly at 68 in 2009. So Mr. Wenders, director of Buena Vista Social Club and Wings of Desire, decided to cancel it. Only after her dancers pressed him did he decide to finish the movie, which features excerpts from four major pieces and scenes of the performers in and around Wuppertal, Germany  on hilltops, in coal mines, in monorails and on medians  bringing to life a dreamscape only Bausch and Mr. Wenders could have conjured.

Not only was he the high priest of the modern American conservative movement and the founding editor in chief of its leading intellectual publication, National Review; he was also a gifted polemicist, best-selling novelist, sesquipedalian speaker, television star, political candidate, yachtsman, harpsichordist, wit and bon vivant. Small wonder that I once saw him nod approvingly when a tongue-tied freshman referred to his 1951 autobiographical best seller as God as Man at Yale. He performed his many roles with such panache, and such obvious enjoyment of being William F. Buckley Jr., that he captivated people who otherwise would have despised someone who did much to move the United States politically to the right from the early 1950s until his death in 2008. But even liberals had to laugh when Buckley, asked whether he slouched in his chair as host of the TV program Firing Line because he couldnt think on his feet, drawled, It is hard . . . to stand up . . . under the weight . . . of all that I know.",2011-12-09T21:09:44+0000

This is rarely the case in Indian novels, where mangoes tend to be luminescent orbs dangling in steamy air, glistening with sweetness, sex and Being itself, waiting to be plucked, caressed, birthed. Either that or theyre muddy and rotten and piled high on a dirty road, surrounded by rancid garbage, rank cooking fires, beggar children and grinning, greasy swindlers. In other words, mangoes in Indias literary fiction are much like India in literary fiction: distinguished by pleasing aromas or permanent anarchy, if not some chutneyed combination.

Then again, that verbal image applies well to Alexander Popper, known to all simply as Popper, the melancholy, searching main character of Peter Orners third work of fiction. With its short and evocative chapters, its charged and playful language, its movement to and fro in time, the novel is indeed poetic. Its epic too, encompassing Poppers life from childhood into his early 30s as well as chunks of the life spans of his parents and two of his grandparents, with check-ins on various other relatives.",2011-12-09T21:09:57+0000

Willa Cather captured these aspects in her classic 1927 novel Death Comes for the Archbishop. Now Percival Everett, author of genre-bending novels like I Am Not Sidney Poitier and Glyph, vividly evokes the same elements in Assumption, his new trilogy of interwoven murder mysteries. Investigating all three cases is the enigmatic Ogden Walker, deputy sheriff in Plata, a fictional county in the northern part of the state, physically not far from the health farms and art galleries of trendy Taos, but in all other respects a world away. Plata is the opposite of trendy. Its a blink-and-you-missed-it burg of shabby adobe dwellings and aging pickup trucks and trailers like the one Ogden lives in.",2011-12-09T21:10:04+0000

This dread question stalks almost every poetry classroom, and its vanquished only to return with a tenacity that would intimidate Michael Myers. Most recently, Ernie Lepore, a professor at Rutgers, took a swing at it in The New York Timess philosophy blog, The Stone. Lepore is interested in whats sometimes called the heresy of paraphrase  the idea that what a poem is really about is best represented by the poem itself. He concludes that while the usual reasoning behind the heresy claim is suspect, the idea itself is basically right. Poetry, Lepore argues, is not just about its paraphrasable data (and what we might make of that data), but also about the way that data is articulated. So Frosts Mending Wall is about a not-so-bright farmer, a bunch of rocks and their various symbolic accouterments; yet its also about the break between the word balance in Line 18 and Stay in Line 19.",2011-12-09T21:10:37+0000

At times, he could barely walk, ulcers having chewed through the muscle, tendon and bone of his feet. Riddled with malaria, plagued with piles and weakened by pneumonia, he had pulled out several of his rotting teeth using strong thread and a heavy pistol. He had been attacked by roasting heat, pouring rain, tick fever, hostile slavers and leeches as close as smallpox. By 1873, he had an excruciatingly painful blood clot in his intestine the size of a fist. In this extremity of suffering, he found time to appreciate the sweet voice of a tree frog, but it is another entry in his diary  of truly towering understatement  that most perfectly sums up the wry fortitude of men like Livingstone: It is not all pleasure this exploration.",2011-12-09T21:10:49+0000

Since F.D.R., weve measured presidents by their first 100 days. But now its really the only 100 days. Presidents lately seem to have just those 100 days to lay down a transformational agenda and get it passed in their first year  before they have to tailor their politics to the midterm elections  and then, if, as often happens, their party loses the midterms they have to focus on the next presidential election. China has five-year plans. We have 100 days every four. So all Im thinking about now is how we get the most out of the first 100 days of 2013  our next quadrennial chance to make serious policy (barring a crisis that forces our hand).",2011-12-10T21:46:23+0000

It tries to look at why so many Egyptians voted for Islamic parties, and my bottom-line feeling is that Americans are feeling a bit more panicky than is justified. Its not that Egyptians seek a harsh Islamic regime; rather they think the Islamic candidates have a better record working in their neighborhoods and may be a little less likely to take bribes than other candidates. Plenty of the hand-wringing seems to be coming from Americans whove never actually met a Muslim Brotherhood member or a Salafi, and Id suggest not overdoing the rhetoric.

us,Rumor Fever,"HONG KONG  China hosts some 300 million microblog accounts (including my own), and officials say that domestic social media put out more than 200 million posts every day. In hopes of getting a handle on this potentially threatening surge of information, the government has started a campaign that aims to quash what it calls rumors  statements that it says threaten the public order but that it has not bothered to define. After a series of public opinion disasters this past year, the Communist Party has been pressuring social media providers to weed out allegations it finds threatening, and state media have tried to whip up fear over their malignant social effects.The partys fever over rumors began in August, following the July 23 high-speed rail collision in Wenzhou. The government took a public opinion beating over the crash, in large part because social media harnessed anger over the bungled rescue effort, the safety of the high-speed rail network and corruption in the Railways Ministry. Once party leaders wrested back control of the story, they pushed all relevant facts into the darkness, leaving only rumors to sate the publics appetite for the truth. And this summer two other embarrassing public opinion defeats for Chinas leadership originally took off on the Internet: the Guo Meimei affair, which exposed irregularities at the government-run Red Cross Society of China, and the massive and well-organized public demonstrations against a chemical project in Dalian.",2011-12-12T13:23:23+0000

Palestinians object to Israels carrying out any work at the site in Jerusalems Old City on grounds that it is in occupied territory, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war. Any change in the status quo there has the potential to set off unrest. The bridge, known as the Mugrabi ramp, was erected as a temporary measure in 2004 after an older ramp collapsed.

In the course of the semester my students have learned how to read religion clause cases against the background of long-standing debates in philosophy and theology about the relationship between religious imperatives and the obligations of democratic citizenship. They have become adept at recognizing the arguments behind the arguments the justices are making explicitly. They can see how a case ostensibly about vouchers or school prayer or Christmas trees on courthouse steps is really about whether principle or history should inform a courts decisions. They can see how a case about head coverings or beards in the military (a topic that has surfaced once again) turns on the distinctions set down in John Lockes Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), a tract the justices may never have read. They can see how the majority and dissenting opinions in a free exercise case often reflect a tension between negative and positive liberty as these terms are defined by Isaiah Berlin, an author the justices will likely not have referenced. They can see how the entire history of religion-clause jurisprudence at once illustrates and is an extended critique of John Rawlss attempt in Political Liberalism to devise a form of government that will be fair to religion while at the same time keeping it at arms length.",2011-12-13T02:00:49+0000

No sooner did I write a post suggesting that future primaries would benefit from more intimate debates  featuring smaller group of candidates rather than the whole field, longer answers rather than short ones, and so on  than yesterdays Jon Huntsman-Newt Gingrich Lincoln-Douglas debate went and demonstrated why that could turn out to be an absolutely terrible idea. Trip Gabriels writeup for the Times does a good job of capturing the droning deadliness of the affair, the painful seminar-room quality, the absence any spark in the candidatess answers to the exquisitely-polite questions. (After an hour and a half, when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined, the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief.) If Gingrich made good on his pledge to teach an online class while in the Oval Office, I imagine that it would turn out something like this. And if Huntsmans supporters want to know why their man has struggled to inspire any excitement or strong support, despite an impressive record and solid conservative bona fides, the answer begins with the fact that he just spent 90 minutes on a stage with the candidate leading in the polls and never once said anything that might actually make some real news for his own struggling campaign.

Slowly, since the 1960s, Benton Harbor has lost all its factories and half its population; those who remain subsist on a per capita income of $10,000. The citys finances are so wrecked that the state government sent in an emergency manager who answers to no one locally.

One option under consideration had been splitting the primary into two separate elections, a move that many Democrats and Republicans opposed, saying it would hurt voter turnout, cost counties hundreds of thousands of dollars and create logistical problems for elections officials.

No executions have been conducted in California since 2006, when a federal judge effectively halted lethal injections, citing various deficiencies in the states methods. Since then, the state has revamped its execution system, including the construction of a new death chamber specifically for lethal injections. The corrections department declined to comment on the ruling. ",2011-12-17T06:27:08+0000

Two big sequels, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, delivered shaky results over the weekend, alarming studios about a continued downturn at the North American box office. A Game of Shadows (Warner Brothers) was No. 1 with about $40 million in ticket sales. Analysts had expected that film, which cost $125 million to make, to take in over $50 million; the first installment in this franchise opened with $62 million in 2009. Chipwrecked (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $23.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. That result was 52 percent below the opening weekend total for the last Chipmunks movie in 2009. Chip-Wrecked cost an estimated $80 million to make. A variety of factors could have dented interest: sequel fatigue, family film overload, higher ticket prices, a lack of overall momentum at the box office. Elsewhere, Tom Cruises Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol (Paramount) was a powerful third, taking in about $13 million in limited release on 425 Imax screens. That result set an Imax record and positioned Ghost Protocol as a potential blockbuster and career rebound for Mr. Cruise as it expands nationwide on Wednesday. New Years Eve (Warner) was fourth with about $7.4 million in ticket sales, lifting its two-week total to $24.8 million. The Sitter (Fox) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4.4 million for a two-week total of $17.7 million.",2011-12-18T18:07:29+0000

The schedule for the festival, to run from June 16 to Aug. 26, was released on Sunday. Among the other highlights of this years festival are a rare United States performance by the Hong Kong Ballet of Kinsun Chans Black on Black; a world premiere by the Swedish choreographer and dancer Pontus Lidberg, performed by Morphoses; and a collaboration between Jonah Bokaer and David Hallberg. This year Ella Baff, the executive and artistic director of Jacobs Pillow, decided to break with that institutions tradition of offering mostly new works. She programmed repeat performances of three popular dances from past festivals: Tero Saarinens Shaker-inspired Borrowed Light from 2006, Crystal Pites Dark Matters from last summer and Doug Elkinss Frulein Maria from 2009.

Theyre a reminder of how much successful political heroism depends, in the end, on the ability to prick the conscience of iniquity, and to remind even the worst regimes and most compromised authorities that there are moral absolutes which they transgress at their peril. The great success of the Velvet Revolution, like the successes of Gandhi and Mandela and Martin Luther King and so many other icons of peaceful revolution, was achieved by public argument as well as by public protest, and by the fact that the bureaucrats and apparatchiks and generals the revolutionaries were confronting werent willing to take the most absolute and unthinkable steps to retain their privileges and defend their power. (In David Chappells A Stone of Hope, a history of religion and the civil rights movement, theres a fascinating account of how this worked in the white South  the way that the Christian appeals of King and Ralph Abernathy and Co. persuaded many white Christians that they had a moral obligation to stand by and let the revolution happen, rather than defend Jim Crow to the end.) When civil disobedience works, it does so by reminding the inhumane of their inhumanity, and by finding the vulnerabilities in what seem like permanently hardened hearts. In this sense, theres a circular quality to any successful peaceful revolt: No De Klerk without Mandela but also no Mandela (as we know Mandela) without De Klerk; no Gorbachev without Sakharov and Walesa and Havel, but no Havel and Walesa (as we know them) without Gorbachev.",2011-12-19T19:13:37+0000

us,Elizabeth Taylors Final Legacy,"After the last diamond-encrusted bauble had been snatched up, the last item of Dior couture sold, the last Fendi handbag handed on to a new owner, the sale of Elizabeth Taylors vast collections netted$156.8 million. The four days of sales at Christies became the most valuable private jewelry sale in history ($137.2 million) and the most valuable private collection of fashion ever sold ($5.5 million). The first online-only Christies sale drew 57,000 bids and reaped $9.5 million. The complete collection sold out, a testament to both the stars magnetism and the quality of the merchandise.All the proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Taylor Trust, which manages the Taylor estate. Taylor was well-known in her later years for her fund-raising and activism for AIDS research. A portion of the profit generated by Christies sale of exhibition tickets (58,000 people saw the exhibit in its internationaltravels), event sponsorship and the ongoing sales of select publications, will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. The auction house also raised $170,00 through the sale of a deluxe limited edition boxed set of the catalogs on the first evening of the auction, which will also go to the foundation. Some highlights from the later sales: those Vuitton trunks, with the violet-colored tags reading Mine! sold for $245,500, the top figure for the accessories sale. The Andy Warhol lithograph signed and dedicated by the artist went for $662,000. A (quite hideous) beaded Versace bolero jacket featuring rhinestone images of Taylor in some of her famous roles fetched $128,500. Even rocks Taylor never actually wore went for big sums: a large gray scholars rock netted $386,500, more than 30 times its estimate of $8,000 to $12,000.Christies will complete the dispersal of the Taylor collections in the new year with sales of her Old Master paintings (Jan. 25 in New York), including a Frans Hals portrait (not of Taylor), and her Impressionist and modern art collection (London, Feb. 7 and 8).Chris Wilding, Taylors son and a trustee of the foundation, said, My mother always acknowledged that she was merely the temporary custodian of the incredible things she owned.

But eventually the original turned up in the hands of a cinematographer who said he had received it from Welles as a gift, and, after a court fight, it was turned over to Welless daughter Beatrice. When the original first went on the block, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences went to court to try to stop the sale, but lost. Sothebys later tried to sell it, but ended that effort when an undisclosed reserve price was not met. And, now, finally the Oscar has been sold in an auction that, according to Sanders, included an underbid from the magician David Copperfield.

I knew I wanted it to be something special and seasonal, but the constraints posed by the party (it was held at the Center for Fiction, a lovely place, but one not equipped with a full bar or full kitchen) demanded that I keep it simple. Not a worry, as Im inclined to keep it simple where cocktails are concerned.The classic rye Manhattan was my starting point. What if I replaced the sweet vermouth with ginger syrup? That worked fine, but something was missing. I was testing the drink in a friends kitchen in New Hampshire over Thanksgiving weekend. A bowlful of clementines (one of my favorite winter treats) sat on the counter. Freshly squeezed clementine juice  and a generous dousing of Angostura bitters  brought the whole thing together.Its easy to make ginger syrup: I prepare a basic sugar-and-water simple syrup, in which I steep peeled, fresh ginger long enough that its strong, spicy bite really comes through. But you can skip this step altogether and buy the excellent ready-made ginger syrup from Brooklyns Morris Kitchen.As a nod to the bitters and the clementine, I christened the drink the Bitter Darling.

us,The Republican Cul-De-Sac,"There are any number of things Id rather be doing 72 hours before Christmas than writing about the payroll tax debate, but its an important window into the continuing policy dysfunction afflicting the Republican Party. The problem, to be clear, doesnt lie in the particular stance that the House Republicans have taken over the last week, insisting on a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut rather than two-month extension agreed to in the Senate. (On the merits, the House is right to want a full-year extension, the Senates punt was an embarrassment, and the compromise that may be in the offing looks like better policy than a purely short-term deal.) Rather, it lies in the fact that weve been having drawn-out negotiations about the issue at all. Republicans should have just taken yes for answer, embraced a bipartisan tax cut, declared victory and gone home for Christmas. Instead, a Republican Party that blithely voted to extend the Bush tax cuts without any offsets suddenly became very, very concerned about paying for a far more modest measure, and a G.O.P. thats supposedly committed to the lowest possible middle class tax burden decided that it needed to extract concessions from a Democratic president in exchange for supporting  a middle class tax cut.",2011-12-22T19:45:25+0000

(Factoring in the audiences that watched the show on DVR in the following seven days, that number grows to 12.4 million.)

The protests took hold in Tunisia in late 2010 after the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire. The kindle caught and the spirit of his self-immolation lit a fuse across the region. A wave of protests struck Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan. Almost as soon as protesters in Cairo were being herded away from Tahrir Square, they were dancing at the news of Mubaraks resignation. Ruling families began to fall. Power-transfer treaties were brokered. Parliaments were dissolved. Monarchs locked their gates and boarded their windows. In Libya, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was ousted and killed. NATO planes streaked a sky so blue it seemed it to speak of other Septembers. Faces, too, were lit by a new blue light. It was the era of the revolution down through the wires: time was collapsed and geography shrunk by the use of social networking. The whole world was indeed watching, listening, e-mailing. Some in the media lost their lives for the art of the images that emerged  the photographs didnt just capture singular moments, but they looked backward and forward at the same time, at what has happened, and what is yet to come. Thelight from the Arab Spring rose from the ground up; the hopeis now that the darkness doesnt fall.",2011-12-23T07:15:08+0000

Cities shook their souls out. The yearning went global. Some protesters poured gasoline into bottles and lighted the sky with fire. Others unfurled hammocks under light poles. The idea was to be seen, to be heard, to be tweeted. The year 2011 was an evanescent spectacle of anger. Every corner was a world, and every world had its corners. The bankers stood back, the corporations hushed a moment, the politicians held their breath, and the cops took out their pepper spray. It might have begun in Wisconsin, had its adolescence in Greece, and shattered the night in London, but it lost and won its innocence in Zuccotti Park. Suddenly, a tent had as much meaning as a tower. Kids from all over the country boiled collard greens in the courtyard of commerce. The citys bureaucrats tried frantically to barricade them in, or out  nobody seemed sure which. The anger rolled all the way down to Wall Street and the markets shivered a moment. When cold weather kicked in, the tents began to disappear and the anger diffused, but the images remained, another sort of fire in flight. ",2011-12-23T07:15:09+0000

The soldiers moved through the sandstorms, and landed back home in the United States to deal with the continuing legacy of American foreign policies. In 2011, Barack Obamas promises were finally beginning to find their way onto the front pages. A spectacular nighttime raid found Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The helicopters landed. The weight of the past was kicked up in the dust. Author of a decade of killing, Bin Laden had endpages that were quick and sharp. He was shot dead, buried at sea, and the White House held its breath: it sounded so much like a sigh of joy, exhausted and necessary. The soldiers continued their journeys: it was a big world they were returning to. The seven billionth baby was born, starting global discussions on issues of environment, health and technology. Europe teetered on the edge of ruin, stunned by even more economic philandering. In the fall, lights were lit for Kim Il-sung and a regime that has hidden its face. In Norway the island of Utoya heard gunshots among the trees. Parts of Africa were dealing, yet again, with an almost impossible hunger and thirst.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant went into meltdown and watched its poisons filter out to sea, and what remained is what we all must live with: the democratic rage of nature. No matter what we do, we cannot regulate how we are shaped by weather. We look for calm, but there is always an inevitability of storm. The images from Joplin, Mo., were pure with grief. A snowstorm paralyzed Tulsa, Okla. The Souris River shed more than a tear. The streets of Bangkok were almost apocalyptic during floods. There were droughts, earthquakes, wildfires scattering animals like dice. So, the question, then, is ancient: How with such rage shall beauty hold a plea? Rescuers in Turkey put their fingers on part of the pulse when they managed to pull 2-week-old Azra Karaduman from the rubble. Her mother and grandmother also emerged safely.

Of course he didnt write these works in the afterlife, even if such a feat is no doubt every authors fantasy; the bulk of the posthumous material is drawn from the beginning and middle of his career, before the Spanish publication of The Savage Detectives in 1998 turned him into an international phenomenon. The amount of unpublished work tells a story. We read these previously missing early texts differently because we have the later ones. It is also possible that the early work will help us with the later work. (This is likely to be true of the still untranslated Sinsabores del Verdadero Polica, published in Spanish this year, which Bolao was working on from the 1980s to his death.

us,Finding My Religion,"Books about God tend to fall into two categories: objective inquiries into the nature of belief and personal tales of spiritual awakening. One type explores history, creation myths and religious ritual. In the other, the author typically undergoes a crisis  a terminal illness, the death of a loved one, an onset of existential dread  that causes him to confront his lifes emptiness, coming to realize that there is something out there greater than himself.",2011-12-23T14:49:59+0000

us,How Insomnia Feels,"Its hard to ignore the force of the sentences in Blake Butlers new book, Nothing: a Portrait of Insomnia. Best known for his fiction, Butler is obsessed with the possibilities of syntax, and the most obvious feature of Nothing is a lyric and intellectual buffer overflow that results in long, often interestingly ungrammatical sentences, sometimes stretching over six pages. The most ornate of these is adorned with footnotes, a nod to David Foster Wallace, to whose memory the book is dedicated. As such the book draws attention to its own linguistic surfaces in ways that most memoirs never attempt.",2011-12-23T14:53:34+0000

us,Paul Nelson: Bad Boy Rock Critic,"Paul Nelson, a propagandist committed to some dubious values, had a gift for imbuing disreputable, even dangerous ideas with discomforting grace. You might almost say he was the Leni Riefenstahl of rock criticism. One of the first writers of the post-Elvis era to take the popular music of his time seriously, he never liked black music and thought the blues were overrated, negligible in comparison with the work of overtly cerebral and conspicuously poetic artists of the 60s and early 70s like Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne. Nelson revered Browne. He subscribed, both in his writing and in his life, to the macho outcast myths of noir movies and pulp fiction, and he seemed blind to the importance of the great female artists nearly absent in his writing, like Joni Mitchell and Aretha Franklin. Nelson loathed the music of Patti Smith.",2011-12-23T14:57:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"THE USUAL SUSPECTS: Tom Clancys fans like to describe his macho geek-boy thrillers as prescient, citing among other things his 1994 novel Debt of Honor, in which a deranged pilot crashes a 747 into the Capitol. On Sept. 11, 2001, Clancy himself played up the overlap on CNN, without mentioning that the book is a ludicrous alarmist fantasy about a corporate-controlled Japan making war on America. In other words, it was less prescient than derivative: Rising Sun, Michael Crichtons version of The Japanese are coming! had been a best seller two years before. In a telephone interview on Charlie Rose later on 9/11, Clancy again seemed out of the loop. As Roses panelists talked about Osama bin Laden and the possibility of military retaliation, Clancy jumped in petulantly. Saying Osama bin Laden,  he insisted, is like Claude Rains in Casablanca saying, Round up the usual suspects. Hes simply the usual suspect. But there has been no definitive information linking him to this event. Until there is, talking about him is just a waste of air. Later on the program, as the former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger tried to answer a question, Clancys disembodied voice floated over the set.

At least 16 people were killed and thousands near the dumping areas were sickened, the Ivory Coast government said. The court found Trafigura guilty of concealing the dangerous nature of the sludge, a mix of oil-products waste and caustic chemicals, when its ship, the Probo Koala, delivered its load to the Netherlands in 2006 for treatment and disposal. After deciding it would be cheaper to dispose of the load elsewhere, Trafigura then illegally exported the waste to the Ivory Coast, the court said. The company, which has denied wrongdoing, has paid Ivory Coast a settlement of close to $200 million. A spokesman for the company called the decision disappointing but did not say if the company would appeal to the countrys highest court. ",2011-12-24T02:21:08+0000

After the Legislature voted to abolish them this summer, several cities and agencies sued, saying the state had no right to the funds. The court said that abolishing the agencies was a proper exercise of the legislative power vested in the Legislature and that the government could establish or dissolve local agencies and subdivisions as it sees fit. The Legislature also approved a plan allowing cities to reorganize the agencies if they agreed to use the money for state obligations this year, but the court ruled that plan invalid, effectively eliminating the nearly 400 agencies.

This in turn brings on the depression that overtakes her and seems to inaugurate the end of the world or her dream of the same.

When he left me, the most boring book seemed delightful. Catherine read plenty in Russian, Massie reports, but French was the language she preferred, and she read French books indiscriminately, picking up whatever her ladies-in-waiting happened to be reading. She always kept a book in her room and carried another in her pocket. The empress eventually bought Diderots library for more than 50,000, thus sealing her reputation as a patron of the arts and making the rest of Europe finally take notice of Russia as a cultural center.",2011-12-30T17:06:12+0000

If a corporation has laudable reasons for establishing a company town, it should do the things that uplift the residents and help them participate in their own stability. It is obvious that what Whirlpool and the current state government were really after was a takeover of the shorefront property for a resort that benefits the wealthy outsiders and edges out the undesirable community who has been gifted the shorefront land.

On the other hand, the U.S. fails to understand how alarming it is for Pakistan, and rightfully so, to see the growing strengthening of the India-Afghanistan axis, both its bitter enemies. Successive Afghan governments since the day that Pakistan was created have maintained a very hostile attitude except for the few years under Taliban rule.
