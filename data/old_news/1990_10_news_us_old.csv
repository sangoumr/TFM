But not unlike his most gifted predecessors in the same Hollywood niche, Charles Durning and the late Kenneth McMillan, Mr. Dennehy cannot keep away from the stage. A few seasons back he earned acclaim at the Goodman Theater here for his title performance in Brecht's ''Galileo.'' Later he proved an exceptionally sensitive Lopakhin in the Peter Brook ''Cherry Orchard'' that visited Brooklyn. Now Mr. Dennehy has returned to the Goodman in a Eugene O'Neill role that is made for him - Hickey, in ''The Iceman Cometh'' - and his shattering turn leaves one hungry to see his Falstaff, his Macbeth and, when the time is ripe, his Lear and his James Tyrone. Mr. Dennehy is a big bear of a man, but sometimes more of a teddy bear than a grizzly. There's a buried, dainty tenderness in his burly frame as well as a hint of festering violence. As Hickey, a hardware salesman who comes to Harry Hope's end-of-the-line gin mill and flophouse on a deranged evangelical mission, the actor shows off a spectrum of passions that runs from love to hate, from a drummer's forced optimism to a condemned man's sweaty vertigo. His Hickey seems to encapsulate all the salesmen in American theatrical literature, from Meredith Willson's ebullient Harold Hill to Arthur Miller's weary Willy Loman. At the same time, O'Neill's four-and-a-half-hour play, written in 1939 and first presented on Broadway in 1946, bridges the illusion-stripping theatrics of early moderns like Ibsen and Strindberg and the bleak, godless terrain of post-war Beckett dramas that were still to come.",1990-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT/FOOTBALL,"THE QUARTERBACKS: The Uncensored Truth About the Men in the Pocket. By Mickey Herskowitz. (Morrow, $19.95.) This vigorous book is a collection of salty, wry profiles of 29 of the best quarterbacks to have played professional football over the past 40 years. The sportswriter Mickey Herskowitz clearly possesses the two essential qualities for the project: he has a pitch-perfect ear for the tang of American talk and he regards football (rightly) as far more entertaining (and essential) than almost anything else in life. Quarterbacks, in the words of the former coach Tommy Prothro, ''are the most credited, discredited, booed, cheered, revered, hated people in the game.'' Mr. Herskowitz allows these unique hero-scapegoats to reflect, largely in their own words, on what it was like to be (sometimes simultaneously) all of those things. Most of them seem to agree, despite the considerable physical and emotional costs, with Terry Bradshaw when he describes his profession as ''the greatest thing that ever happened to me.'' The lives celebrated here - beginning with that of Sammy Baugh, ''the greatest thrower of footballs the sport has seen,'' concluding with that of Joe Montana, the king of the comeback, and including those of George Blanda, Joe Namath, Y. A. Tittle, Bart Starr, Ken Stabler, Fran Tarkenton and Roger Staubach - are filled with enough disappointment, resiliency and triumph to sound (as several subjects allow) more like a bad film than real life. The profiles combine to form a rough portrait of the modern National Football League, from its scuffling early days, ''when the size of a team's phone bill might determine whether or not it broke even,'' to its present status as a corporate behemoth. ''The Quarterbacks'' takes us as close as we can get to the exhilaration and dejection of being the man in the pocket, sometime bum, sometime miracle maker, still the best symbol of what we believe the game of football to be.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Add more Roman numerals than the Caesars ever counted and you have the gist of THE SUPER BOWL (Simon & Schuster, $50), a coffeetable book modestly subtitled ''Celebrating a Quarter-Century of America's Greatest Game.'' Six sportswriters - Ray Didinger, Mickey Herskowitz, Kevin Lamb, Bill McGrane, Phil Musick, Shelby Strother and John Wiebusch - contribute dramatic accounts of the 24 (or should I say XXIV?) contests. At one time the designation of Super Bowls by Roman numerals seemed campy, but the practice has become risible as the game itself has become merely an event around which America plans a late January party. The use of the Roman numerals becomes irritating in the book; the average fan does not know when Super Bowl XIV was, let alone who played in it. In the introduction alone, there are nearly 100 Roman numerals - enough to confuse even Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the National Football League. Fortunately, there are also a lot of Arabic numerals: every play of every Super Bowl is listed, along with statistics of all sorts. Hundreds of excellent color photographs enliven the book. Though most of the accounts of the games are written with too much pomp and melodrama and without much humor, the avid fan will savor the memories jogged by each chapter.

I knew instantly that I could never be a real doctor. Never mind that I hadn't been allowed a wink of sleep in 30 hours. Never mind that holding a retractor - a diabolical device ostensibly used to pry open a surgical wound so that the surgeon can see what he is doing, but actually used, from its other end, for torturing medical students into permanent submission - is one of the most tedious tasks carried on inside a hospital. Never mind that I hadn't nodded off long enough for either the surgeon or the fully-awake patient - both gazing deeply into the excavated forearm - to notice. Never mind. It was over. I was just not up to snuff. Now snuff is something a real doctor would never indulge in, but cliches are something else again. I could hear my immediate boss - an intern who, it was said on good authority, scarfed down a bowl of scalpel blades for breakfast - saying, ''You're just not up to snuff.''",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Bissinger tells us in the preface to ''Friday Night Lights,'' ''the idea of high school sports keeping a town together, keeping it alive. So I went in search of the Friday night lights, to find a town where they brightly blazed . . . a place that people had to pull out an atlas to find and had seen better times, a real America.'' I hope he was satisfied when his search brought him to oil-busted Odessa, Tex. - ranked the fifth worst city in the United States to live in by Money magazine in 1987, rated the seventh most stressful out of 286 metropolitan areas studied by Psychology Today in 1988, and considered the second worst city out of 333 in a quality-of-life survey by the Places Rated Almanac in 1989. Larry McMurtry, in his novel ''Texasville,'' described it as simply the ''worst town on earth.'' Odessa did, however, have one thing that folks outside this barren, hardscrabble slice of West Texas could not sneer at, and that fit Mr. Bissinger's bill with a vengeance: the Permian High School football team. Since 1964, the team ''had won four state championships, been to the state finals a record eight times, and made the playoffs fifteen times. Its worst record in any season over that time span had been seven and two, and its winning percentage overall, .825, was by far the best of any team in the entire state in the modern era of the game dating back to 1951.'' The team, which Mr. Bissinger took a one-year leave of absence from The Philadelphia Inquirer to follow through the 1988 season, plays in a $5.6-million stadium that includes a sunken artificial-turf playing field 18 feet below ground level, seats 20,000 fans and has a full-time caretaker who lives on the premises. On Friday nights, capacity crowds chant ''MO-JO'' - the team's official nickname, for no good reason - over and over. Each of the cheerleaders, called Pepettes, ''brought some type of sweet for her player every week before the game,'' and they made such elaborate signs for the players' front yards that ''finally a dictum was handed down that all the signs must be made the same way, without any neon.'' In 1988, Permian spent $70,000 on chartered jets for road games and $6,400 on rushed film prints of games for the coaches. On the other hand, Permian (like all the schools in Odessa) was not integrated until 1982, and the 1988 budget for teaching materials for the school's English department was $5,040. Mr. Bissinger, to his credit, looks unflinchingly at the racial turmoil of this doggedly conservative community where teen-age football players are treated ''like privileged children of royalty,'' or what passes for royalty in Odessa. It is a tricky balancing act, but Mr. Bissinger carries it off: ''Friday Night Lights'' offers a biting indictment of the sports craziness that grips not only Odessa but most of American society, while at the same time providing a moving evocation of its powerful allure.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Last year the syndicated sports columnist Jerry Izenberg was given access by the New York Giants' coaching staff to their meetings and team preparation for the week preceding a crucial game with the Philadelphia Eagles on Dec. 3. The result, ''No Medals for Trying,'' is a graphic, gripping view of professional football. Mr. Izenberg profiles members of the Giants organization from coaches to groundskeepers, but his most vivid portraits are of the head coach Bill Parcells, the quarterback Phil Simms and the linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Mr. Parcells is portrayed as a master psychologist and motivator whose concern for his players is surpassed only by his Spartan work ethic. Mr. Izenberg describes the struggles of Mr. Simms and Mr. Taylor to play despite serious ankle injuries. Both men did suit up for the contest, which decided first place in the National Football Conference's Eastern Division. The game, which was won by the Eagles, is covered from the kickoff to the final gun. Mr. Izenberg insightfully tells how the best offensive and defensive schemes can succeed or go awry on game day. His descriptions of team meetings infuse flesh and blood into the X's and O's on the chalkboard. But ''No Medals for Trying'' also gives us the feel of being on the Astroturf as 280-pound defensive ends bear down on us. Best of all, we don't have to worry about getting crunched.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

One can only imagine what she would have said about the traditionally surly service meted out by employees who didn't have to worry much about getting tipped or fired. Recently the hotels were sold to a local entrepreneur who has hired his own no-nonsense manager, an energetic woman named Galina Murina, to cater to the coming wave of capitalists. One of her first acts was to replace the party retainers staffing the establishments, now called the Mercury hotels, with people trained to be friendly and helpful. She has also introduced fax machines and translators for the Western business clientele. ''I understand one thing,'' Miss Murina said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trillin, the author, raconteur, writer for The New Yorker and columnist for The Nation, will open Off Broadway in ''Calvin Trillin's Words, No Music'' at the American Place Theater on 46th Street. On Oct. 17 ''Jackie Mason: Brand New'' will open on Broadway at the Neil Simon (previews begin Tuesday). Having lived and learned during their earlier shows - Mr. Mason in ''The World According to Me'' in 1986 and Mr. Trillin in ''Uncle Sam'' in 1988 - the pair recently got together to talk about their new acts and what works and what doesn't out there alone in front of the footlights. Here are excerpts from their conversation. Trillin: So what are you doing this time that's different? Mason: Everything I do is different. You have fans who come to see you again. Usually you can't depend on new customers because the new ones are guys who didn't like you in the first place or they would have come to the first show. So you're playing to the same people. It has to be a whole new show. I do the newest situations - politics, economics. I talk about the contradictions and the ridiculousnesses in the way people behave, about luxury apartment buildings that have fantastic lobbies without apartments. The new politics up to and including crime in New York and oil and the Gulf situation.

Because computers have made their way into nearly every corner of our lives, the professionals who design computers may unwittingly possess as much control over our future as elected officials. Yet students preparing for careers in computer and software development often receive little - or no - instruction in the ethical problems they will create. Two Australians, Tom Forester, who teaches at the School of Computing and Information Technology at Griffith University in Queensland, and Perry Morrison, a lecturer in computing at the University of New England in New South Wales, offer a provocative look into the moral issues surrounding the world's most powerful machines. ''We argue,'' they write in ''Computer Ethics,'' ''that computer systems by their very nature are insecure, unreliable and unpredictable - and that society has yet to come to terms with the consequences.'' Computer crime could cost each of the top 300 companies in the United States $2 million to $10 million a year, they write, but only 35 percent of I.B.M. mainframes used security software by late 1988. London's computerized air traffic control system failed six times in 12 months. Perhaps even more frightening is the 10-year delay in warnings about ozone depletion; software employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration called satellite ozone measurements spurious because they were so low. Mr. Forester and Mr. Morrison have chapters on computer crime, software theft, computer hacking and viruses, computer unreliability, invasion of privacy, artificial intelligence and computers in the work place. While their prose occasionally wanders toward flat assertion, the authors' stated goal is to provoke debate in an area too often dominated by dehumanized logic.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000
us,"  Big, Beautiful and Endangered","What weighs about six tons, stands roughly 12 feet high and has an appendage comprising 100,000 muscles that can hold two gallons of water and can detect odors five miles away? You guessed it: the African elephant, the largest land mammal on earth. These huge creatures, which can kill a man as effortlessly as a man can kill an insect, are the subject of ELEPHANTS OF AFRICA (Safari Press, P.O. Box 3095, Long Beach, Calif. 90803, $45), a beautifully designed book of paintings and drawings by Paul Bosman, a wildlife artist, with text by Anthony Hall-Martin, a wildlife biologist. Their years of observation and research, which took them the length and breadth of Africa in search of elephants in their varied environments, resulted in this informative scientific study. Centuries ago mammoths, the ancestral form of the modern elephant, were hunted by prehistoric men, who covered the walls of their caves with wonderful paintings of these great hairy beasts. Their ivory tusks, which were 10 to 13 feet in length, were like sweeping, curved scythes. One of the oldest ivory carvings known is at least 25,000 years old. Nowadays, with ivory poachers decimating the herds, the African elephant population has dropped by 50 percent in the last decade, and with its present rate of decline the elephant will disappear from the continent within 10 years. The preservation of these magnificent animals, as well as other species that share in their varied environments, is a must. ''Elephants of Africa'' should go a long way toward helping to achieve this goal.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

The AT was expensive and powerful, but it was also bulky. The 80286 chip, which functions as the computer's brain, resided on one large circuit board about the size of a dinner plate. Since then, the 80286, now known simply as the 286, has been eclipsed by newer computer chips. But the 286 has become so widespread that it is almost a generic computer chip, as are the I.B.M. personal computer clones based on it. Reflecting this, Advanced Micro Devices, a chip manufacturer based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has now brought out a chip that has shrunk the 286 - and all the other AT control circuitry - onto a single chip the size of a thumbnail.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

For a concert that promised repertory ranging from Bach and Debussy to the Beatles and Tom Waits, four musicians appeared, the three men in white tie and tails. Yet another evening of classical musicians slumming in crossover land? Not exactly, as it turned out. The Kurorchester (the name translates as health-spa band) was founded in Frankfurt in 1981 by Frank Wolff, a cellist whose almost constant impish grin belied his cherubic demeanor from the outset. He was not immediately convincing when he sprang to his feet to belt out ''Sergeant Pepper'' in the Prelude, but by intermission he was wailing ''A Little Help'' with the compelling maniacal fervor of Janis Joplin or Joe Cocker.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

In hindsight, the style seems as natural and hardy as granite, with its chugging beat, terse riffs and voices poised between pain and exultation. Although Southern soul has been commercially eclipsed, the oldies are still current on television soundtracks and commercials. The style also continues on a few independent labels, in gospel music and among revivalists like Michael Bolton (who shows how hard it is to re-create the style's apparent spontaneity). Two 1990 albums, Robert Cray's ''Midnight Stroll'' (Mercury/PolyGram 846 652; all three formats) and Etta James's ''Stickin' to My Guns'' (Island 842 926; all three formats), can stand alongside the best of 1960's soul.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

us,  When Hollywood Got Real,"MEDIUM COOL: The Movies of the 1960s. By Ethan Mordden. (Knopf, $24.95.) Ethan Mordden is what we don't have much of anymore, especially in film criticism. He is an old-fashioned belletrist, with all the virtues and shortcomings. ''Medium Cool'' is a lively, knowledgeable and eminently readable guide to films of the 1960's, from ''Psycho'' to ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' Mr. Mordden's theses, such as they are, are unexceptionable: films in the 60's pushed at and expanded the boundaries of the permissible; defying genre, they were self-conscious, adversarial and director-driven. The author, whose previous books include ''The Hollywood Studios'' and ''The Hollywood Musical,'' understands the revolutionary significance of 60's movies and describes well the sea change they represented for Hollywood, which was still reeling from the disintegration of the studios. He has an affectionate few paragraphs on a curiosity like ''One-Eyed Jacks'' (the only film Marlon Brando directed) and he even has seen (and appreciated) the Roger Corman quickies. But after we have finished the book, we're still hungry: Mr. Mordden tells us what we already know. To say that 60's films struggled toward naturalism - his overriding thesis - is at least partly true, but not very interesting. He makes no more than a rudimentary attempt to connect the movies to the age or to the changing fortunes of the studios, even though assumptions about these relationships underlie his premises. Then there is the seemingly obligatory occasional 60's-bashing, wherein, scolding like a fussy schoolmarm, Mr. Mordden criticizes films of the decade for their alleged sympathy for the devil, and at one point even blames the excesses of the flower children for the ascent of Ronald Reagan. Nevertheless, for all its faults, this survey is an engaging, if not particularly provocative, read.",1990-10-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Review/Theater;   Clarke's Beastly Humans and Beguiling Beasts,"Flora, a charming half-grown elephant with Dumbo-sized ears, is not the only thing that is elephantine about ''Endangered Species,'' the Martha Clarke theater piece that has opened the Next Wave Festival at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In this show, a few unobjectionable, ecologically sound old-wave ideas - war is hell, man is cruel, animals are nice - have been inflated past the bursting point by grand scenic effects, a large cast of humans and circus animals, fractionalized quotations from Walt Whitman and, presumably, big bucks. It's almost as if Ms. Clarke, the one-time Pilobolus dancer and the wildly imaginative creator of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' and ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' has been afflicted by Broadway-itis. ''Endangered Species'' is Billy Rose's ''Jumbo'' with pieties instead of peanuts. As in ''Miracolo d'Amore'' and ''The Hunger Artist,'' the two disappointing Clarke works that preceded it, this production is short on dance and heavy on mimetic interludes of bestiality, sexual and otherwise. The most evocative choreographic movement is provided by the horses, who periodically circle the vast, wood-chip-carpeted stage in a fleet image out of a Seurat circus painting, and by the performers Lisa Dalton and Felix Blaska, who contribute agile acrobatic stunts with or without animal collaborators. The rest of the time, people come and go reciting sound-bite-sized snippets from ''Leaves of Grass'' that strip down the poetry to simplistic moral-mongering, or sing a capella musical fragments that range from obscure Sondheim to wobbly Pergolesi. Much of the singing is done by the Broadway belter Judy Kuhn, a specialist in playing the walking wounded, who wanders about wearing rags and a hollow-eyed expression that are presumably meant to emblemize the Holocaust.",1990-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,  What a Direness There Was,"Gleanings from a weekend of listening to the House of Representatives talk budget talk: 1. The situation is dire, maybe catastrophic. 2. The direness is the fault of former President Reagan. He told us it was ''morning in America'' when it was really late Saturday night and everybody had had three drinks too many and was refusing to go home to bed. 3. Actually, however, it's the fault of the Democrats in Congress. They are wastrels who delight in squandering the nation's wealth despite Republican warnings that money doesn't grow on trees. 4. In fact, though, it's the fault of President Bush because, after urging everybody to read his lips, he said, ''No new taxes,'' when he should have said, ''The Gipper was kidding us about its being morning in America, folks, and now it's one minute to midnight and we all have to get the wagons drawn up in a circle to keep the wolf from the door.'' 5. What's more, speaking of direness, listening to Congress talk for a whole weekend can start straight-talking Americans speaking in mixed and excessively melodramatic metaphors about encircling wagons at midnight and keeping wolves from the door. 6. Not only that, but also this: Congress should be ashamed of itself for letting the Washington Monument close down on a Saturday, thereby ruining the entire weekend for many Boy Scouts who had planned to ascend it. 7. Well sure, but the person who should really be ashamed of himself is President Bush. He could have signed a simple piece of paper that would have ended the whole fuss, reopened the Washington Monument and let the Congress go home for supper, but he refused to sign that paper. And he calls himself a President! What a shameful way to act. 8. However, if the President signed the paper, Congress would once again just fool around doing nothing until next weekend. Then the Washington Monument would have to be closed all over again. So it's really Congress that ought to be ashamed of itself. 9. True, but not all members of Congress ought to be ashamed. Just the Democrats. The Republicans, who love the taxpayer, struggle tirelessly to bring about a new era when the taxpayer will have to pay no taxes at all and will be known ever after as ''the nontaxpayer.'' The Democrats struggle to prevent this. The Democrats' goal is to bring pain and tears to the taxpayer. 10. One thing is clear, however: The Republicans care only for the very richest of the taxpayers and are determined to load down the very poorest taxpayers with unbearable tax bills in order to save the very richest taxpayers from having to pay any taxes at all. Except for the Democrats, in whose veins courses the milk of human kindness that makes them love the poor and downtrodden, the Republicans would destroy -11. Nevertheless, the situation is much too dire, far too incipiently catastrophic, for either party to engage in partisan debate, simply because the fall elections are just a few weeks off. It is a cynical cheap shot for cheap-shot press cynics to say there is no prospect more dire for a Congressman than defeat in the next election. In fact, Congressmen will make any sacrifice necessary to save the nation from the dire catastrophe said to be looming, provided of course it really is looming and is not just an invention of the Democrats, or the Republicans as the case may be, designed to give the Democrats, or the Republicans as the case may be, an advantage in the coming elections. This goes for Congresswomen as well. 12. Admittedly, though, Congress's failure to produce even a mouse of a budget agreement leaves no doubt that the United States Government can no longer govern and is, therefore, in collapse. 13. Nevertheless, all who love democracy must applaud the House for rejecting that mouse of a budget agreement worked out by the White House and a few Congressional leaders without consulting the hundreds of Congressmen who are devoted to and always in touch with the American people. What made Congress's rejection so noble was not that the budget agreement was a mere mouse of an agreement, but that, mere mouse though it was, it was profoundly unfair. 14. Though, of course, any agreement, whether mouse or mastodon, whether fair or unfair, would be intolerable, since the nation can be saved only by doing away with all taxes. 15. However, and so forth . . . 16. True, but etcetera, not to mention inter alia . . .",1990-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Last week, Mr. Bernstein announced his retirement in a statement that included a medical diagnosis, which said the 72-year-old conductor, who is known to have been a heavy smoker, has progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and pulmonary infections.

He is the first Mexican to win the prize, which carries a cash award of about $700,000. His career as a poet has been twinned with those of diplomat and social commentator. In recent years he has described himself as a ''disillusioned leftist.'' After the prize was announced, Mr. Paz, who was visiting New York, commented, ''The Academy does very well when they choose especially for literary reasons, regardless of popularity of political ideas.''

Mike Lupica, a columnist for the daily sports newspaper The National, is back with his third mystery featuring Peter Finley, a street-smart, wisecracking New York television journalist. In ''Limited Partner,'' Finley decides to launch an investigation after his friend Bobby Wyman is found dead of a drug overdose. Wyman, a recovering addict and alcoholic, was also part owner of a fashionable Upper East Side watering hole. If he had any doubts, Finley is certain of foul play after Wyman's girlfriend is found dead the day after Wyman's funeral, also of an apparent overdose. The body count builds as Finley's search for his friend's killer takes him from trendy uptown bistros to an after-hours club in Greenwich Village. The trail eventually leads to an Upper West Side substance abuse center, where Finley encounters B. J. Remick, a fireballing New York Mets pitcher who happens to have a cocaine problem, and whose confessions point Finley toward a mildly surprising solution to Wyman's murder. Unfortunately, Mr. Lupica's Borscht-Belt one-liners mar ''Limited Partner,'' and his incessant name-dropping detracts from what might otherwise have been a pretty fair whodunit.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED: Multiple Murder and the Elusive Search for Justice in an American Town. By Alan Gelb. (Dutton, $19.95.) The frustrating thing about nonfiction is that sometimes reasonable questions - like, why would a successful high school senior murder his family? - simply do not have reasonable answers. The novelist Alan Gelb lives in East Chatham, N.Y., on the very street where four people were killed in December 1986. In ''Most Likely to Succeed,'' Mr. Gelb eloquently conveys the sense of a town both secure and small; for example, the town justice who presided over a preliminary hearing is also a real-estate agent who later tried to sell the dead family's home. Through it all, however, 17-year-old Wyley Gates, the accused murderer, remains a shadow. Despite being vice president of his high school class, the boy was emotionally alone. His parents were divorced, Mr. Gelb writes, and Wyley resented his father's blue-collar work ethic. Compulsive about computers, Wyley was required to mow the lawn and get his hands dirty at his dad's machine shop, without pay. He especially disliked Cheryl Brahm, his father's longtime companion. Wyley was not close to his older brother, and objected to sharing a room with his 3-year-old orphaned nephew. In retrospect Wyley Gates's mental difficulties are obvious; dozens of better adjusted classmates apparently knew of and ignored Wyley's violent plans, Mr. Gelb writes.

In 1980, Joyce Ann Brown walked into a nightmare from which she did not emerge for nine years. Arrested and convicted of robbery and murder in connection with the holdup of a Dallas furrier, Ms. Brown was sentenced to life imprisonment. That she was innocent, that co-workers testified that she was at work during the crime, counted for nothing. The furrier's wife identified Ms. Brown in a lineup as one of two black women who had robbed the store and killed her husband; during her trial, an inmate Ms. Brown had befriended in jail after her arrest testified that Ms. Brown had bragged to her about the robbery. An all-white jury convicted Ms. Brown despite inconsistencies in testimony and a lack of fingerprints and other evidence linking her to the crime. In ''Joyce Ann Brown: Justice Denied,'' Ms. Brown and the freelance writer Jay Gaines outline her life before and during prison, the banal indignities guaranteed to dehumanize prisoners, and her survival through faith in God and a constant assertion of her innocence. Readers get a kind of crash course in life in a women's prison; what Ms. Brown does not voice is an obviously very controlled woman's inner feelings about being caught in a sinkhole in the justice system. Only once, when she is waiting to hear the verdict that will put her in prison for nine years, does she reveal her feelings: ''They wanted to find me guilty. I could see it in their eyes. I saw hatred for me on their faces.'' The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Ms. Brown's conviction in 1989, after her lawyers filed a writ alleging that prosecutors suppressed evidence and presented perjured testimony. Eventually, charges were dropped and Joyce Ann Brown was a free woman - minus nearly a decade of her life taken from her by the State of Texas.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

''In the wild, animals will spend most of their time foraging for food,'' says Dr. Lester E. Fisher, director of the zoo. ''An elephant will spend a day just moving around eating. In captivity, we've restricted the size of their environment, so current zoo philosophy is to try and give them things to do. We give climbing animals a place to climb, swimming animals a place to swim.'' And painting animals? ''The painting is just another thing for them to do,'' Fisher says. ''We have people who spend most of the day with the elephants, basically just to keep them occupied.''

us,Joint Venture,"The doormat outside of number 36 is the only clue. indeed, unsuspecting visitors would believe that these adjoining houses are exactly as they were meant to be - two separate homes. But when the artist Frank Faulkner bought this 1840's building in upstate New York, he knew he needed lots of space in which to live and paint. ''These houses had been bought by a real estate developer as a speculative project,'' Faulkner recalls. ''One of them had been renovated, the other hadn't.'' Trying to make two houses into a coherent whole can be a tricky undertaking. Rather than make the union noticeable, Faulkner opted to take a subtle tack. The front of the building he left just as it had always been. The artist even kept the two main staircases, which run parallel to each other and share a wall. ''I was going to combine them into one large stair hall,'' Faulkner explains. ''But it would have been terribly expensive, and, in the end, the proportions would have seemed at odds with the rest of the house. So I decided to let it be exactly as it was, a quirky old Greek Revival house.'' The structural change Faulkner did make was to remove the front part of the main wall that divided the houses. He also combined the two narrow kitchens. As a result, it is obvious from the back of the building that the halves have been consolidated. Here, a porch supported by four columns extends into the garden. This outdoor space is Faulkner's summer living room, where he entertains and dines in warm weather.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Families grow, office clutter comes home to roost, possessions multiply while the dimensions of their surroundings do not. There are ways to stretch space, however, tricks to make every inch count. In some cases, simply reconfiguring a floor plan or using clever color and fabric schemes opens up an area. In others, construction may be necessary to enlarge or subdivide a room. Furniture designers are cutting corners by offering utilitarian objects scaled down for cramped interiors. Outdoors, combinations of plants help create a sense of bigness. Forgotten frontiers, such as front yards, can be transformed into colorful, chaotic cottage gardens. In fact, useful space often lurks in the most conspicuous spots.

us,  IN SHORT: FICTION,"DEADLY TRIPLETS: A Theatre Mystery and Journal. By Adrienne Kennedy. (University of Minnesota, $14.95.) For her first novel, the talented playwright Adrienne Kennedy has had the intriguing idea of infusing her theatrical experiences in London with a Gothic sensibility and transforming them into a mystere a clef. With a protagonist who appears to be a thinly disguised substitute for the author, the narrative circles around a female playwright's relationship with a troubled film actor trying his hand at a modern revenge play called ''Deadly Triplets.'' The actor promises to help the playwright unearth the secret of her adopted mother's apparently mysterious death, but instead involves her in his own demise. In spite of Ms. Kennedy's avowed admiration for Conan Doyle, Christie and du Maurier, and in spite of the book's echoes of Charlotte Bronte, even a casual reader of mysteries may sense the author's discomfort with the genre. Omens, portents and presages abound in a volume of just 124 pages; whenever there's a need to heighten tension, a character leaves the country. The mystery of the mother's death is cast aside almost as a red herring, and the central character's present-tense life is left largely undramatized and unexplored. In the end, most of the book's interest turns out to be voyeuristic: one wonders just how much of it is autobiographical. Running throughout is an obsession with fame and famous people, which eventually finds its rightful place in a series of thumbnail sketches appended to the end of the novel. In this ''journal,'' Ms. Kennedy paints precise portraits of such luminaries as Edward Albee, Joseph Losey and Fay Weldon, and tells a classic story of betrayal in the theater. It seems that she had adapted John Lennon's ''nonsense books'' into a play that was eventually given a tryout at the National Theater. Laurence Olivier held her hand throughout the performance, then decided that Lennon, not she, should do the adaptation when the project was resumed a few months later. It is in these sharp sketches and telling anecdotes that Ms. Kennedy's considerable talents are most evident.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Ignore the parenthetical remarks that pockmark, and often pothole, every page. Overlook the repeated descriptions of the heroine's lover, with his ''tall, broad figure'' and his ''much-too-clever, faunlike face.'' What is left at the heart of Susan Kenney's new mystery is a pleasant howdunit. The third in a series featuring an English professor named Rosamund (Roz) Howard, ''One Fell Sloop'' sets this reluctant sleuth to battle an overbearing Scotsman, Alan Stewart, an intellectually and physically well-endowed paleobotonist, and her own highly developed insecurities during a holiday sail around Maine's Penobscot Bay. It is after a ''flaming row'' (''she had gone up in smoke; he had simply gone ashen'') that the two find a murdered body on the beach of a deserted island, with one set of footprints, apparently those of the deceased. The timing couldn't be better. While local authorities dismiss the death as accidental, Roz and Alan can stow their personal angst and concentrate on solving the who, what, when, where, why and, most important, how of the murder. They do this by engaging in seemingly endless theorizing; interviewing the obligatory eccentric Maine characters; confronting one suspect in an amusing, martini-laced scene, and staging a lovers' reconciliation that signals the start of the novel's worthwhile, action-filled ending.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

The memory cards, each about the size of a credit card, are far faster, smaller and more energy efficient than disk drives. Intel is charging $300 for a memory card that can store one megabyte. A card that holds 4 megabytes costs $1,200. A 20-megabyte hard disk drive sells for as little as $150.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,  He Shot the Corpse,"THE LAST FRAME. By Jim Wright. (Carroll & Graf, $16.95.) It takes an intimate knowledge of the newspaper business to create an authentic tough-guy news photographer like Will Carver. Accused of dressing like an overturned dumpster and living life hiding behind his camera, the hero of Jim Wright's first novel, ''The Last Frame,'' leaps moral quandaries and midlife crises in a single bound. When one of his good friends is shot dead, Carver climbs on a counter and takes pictures of the corpse. A cop at the scene pulls him away and asks how he can do such a thing. Carver gives the perfect news photographer's reply: ''When he was alive, Officer, he was my friend. . . . When he died, he became news.'' This funny and quick-paced mystery takes a disrespectful but loving look at both New York and the news photographers who eke out a living there. Carver's ethics are so borderline that no newspaper will hire him full time, but one of the tabloids uses him on a freelance basis. This is the photo equivalent of piecework: no pictures, no money. Need, combined with a genuine journalistic curiosity, entangles Mr. Wright's hero with a sleazy crowd of blackmailers and murderers. Carver's New York is Manhattan - the Strand bookstore, McSorley's Old Ale House, Greenwich Village. He sleeps regularly under a desk in a Lower East Side station house. What gives the book its kick is the way Mr. Wright, the metropolitan editor of The Bergen Record, understands the business of news photography. So when Carver finds himself in the nightmarish position of witnessing a murder without his camera in hand, it's a sure sign that, at age 40, something is going wrong with his life. But no matter how much Carver questions, no matter how much he threatens to quit the photo game, no one should believe him. He is truly addicted. Readers should be, too.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"JOYCE ANN BROWN: Justice Denied. By Joyce Ann Brown with Jay Gaines. (Noble Press, 213 West Institute Place, Suite 508, Chicago, Ill. 60610, Paper, $11.95.) In 1980, Joyce Ann Brown walked into a nightmare from which she did not emerge for nine years. Arrested and convicted of robbery and murder in connection with the holdup of a Dallas furrier, Ms. Brown was sentenced to life imprisonment. That she was innocent, that co-workers testified that she was at work during the crime, counted for nothing. The furrier's wife identified Ms. Brown in a lineup as one of two black women who had robbed the store and killed her husband; during her trial, an inmate Ms. Brown had befriended in jail after her arrest testified that Ms. Brown had bragged to her about the robbery. An all-white jury convicted Ms. Brown despite inconsistencies in testimony and a lack of fingerprints and other evidence linking her to the crime. In ''Joyce Ann Brown: Justice Denied,'' Ms. Brown and the freelance writer Jay Gaines outline her life before and during prison, the banal indignities guaranteed to dehumanize prisoners, and her survival through faith in God and a constant assertion of her innocence. Readers get a kind of crash course in life in a women's prison; what Ms. Brown does not voice is an obviously very controlled woman's inner feelings about being caught in a sinkhole in the justice system. Only once, when she is waiting to hear the verdict that will put her in prison for nine years, does she reveal her feelings: ''They wanted to find me guilty. I could see it in their eyes. I saw hatred for me on their faces.'' The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Ms. Brown's conviction in 1989, after her lawyers filed a writ alleging that prosecutors suppressed evidence and presented perjured testimony. Eventually, charges were dropped and Joyce Ann Brown was a free woman - minus nearly a decade of her life taken from her by the State of Texas.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000
us,  By the Board,"For all of the excitement attending a world championship chess match, the fact is that in recent years most of the games have ended, just like tick-tack-toe, in draws. Little wonder, then, that the grandmaster analysts who assembled in New York City last week for the start of the match between the champion, Gary Kasparov, and Anatoly Karpov (at left) were as animated as Superbowl fans by the end of the second game. After drawing the first game, the charismatic Mr. Kasparov unleashed some moves in the second that were so innovative that the experts at first misunderstood them. But after postgame analysis, the consensus was that he had created a brand new strategy to overcome one of the classic chess defenses and hand Mr. Karpov a crushing defeat. The challenger, who is Mr. Kasparov's political as well as stylistic opposite, called for a postponement of the third game the next day. The 24-game match, with a record $3 million purse, is to resume tomorrow.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

He was present at every design meeting and even spent Friday afternoons at Riccardi's office learning to build an architectural model.

us,  'Phone My Wife. They Finally Got Me.',"LOUD AND CLEAR. By Lake Headley with William Hoffman. (Donald Hutter/Holt, $22.50.) Just before noon on June 2, 1976, Don Bolles, a 47-year-old investigative reporter for The Arizona Republic, stepped into his automobile in the parking lot of the Clarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix, where he had been lured by a small-time criminal and sleazy informant named John Adamson. Moments later, just as he began to pull away from the lot, his car exploded. To those who rushed to his aid, Bolles, near death, uttered, ''Telephone my wife. They finally got me. The Mafia. Emprise. Find John Adamson.'' Bolles remained alive for 11 days, but spoke no other words. A cry went up, especially in journalistic circles, for the culprits to be found, tried, convicted and hanged. The Phoenix police did, indeed, find John Adamson and arrested him for the bombing. Faced with a death sentence, he promptly fingered a local businessman, Max Dunlap, and a plumber, Jim Robison. All three were convicted (Mr. Adamson, against whom the evidence was overwhelming, at first received a sweetheart deal for naming names; it later was revoked when authorities determined he had lied, and he is now appealing a death sentence), but it was only Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Robison who found themselves on death row. Two and a half years after the murder, Lake Headley, a private investigator, was hired by a group of prominent Phoenix citizens who believed that Max Dunlap was innocent, with the express purpose of finding evidence that would exonerate Mr. Dunlap and reopen the case. In fact, as Mr. Headley shows in ''Loud and Clear,'' the case against Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Robison was remarkably flimsy. As Mr. Headley dug he found that evidence involving some pretty prominent Arizona citizens involved in some nefarious doings had been either ignored, suppressed or conveniently ''lost.'' Despite many roadblocks, which included threats and harassment, Mr. Headley persevered and, due in large part to his efforts, the convictions against Mr. Robison and Mr. Dunlap were finally overturned in 1980. With the able help of William Hoffman, whose books include ''Beyond Reach: The Search for the Titanic,'' Mr. Headley, who is not afraid to name his own list of suspects, provides the reader with a fascinating account of Arizona corruption, along with what amounts to a step-by-step primer on the investigation of a murder case.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Which is why Scheerer, a partner of Bilhuber Inc., a New York-based design company, decided to redecorate rather than move out of his East Side studio. Three years ago, the space had glazed aubergine walls, an 18th-century screen and, in the middle of the room, a bed that doubled as a sofa. ''I wanted to pare down,'' he explains. The decorator also felt it was time to introduce a new color scheme. Now the walls and furniture are in shades of beige, sand, brown and white, which appear to enlarge the room. ''The apartment in its first incarnation was really a nighttime place,'' says Scheerer. ''This way, it works well during the day, too.'' Changing the traffic pattern also helped open up the space. The designer has placed the bed to one side, perpendicular to the fireplace. On the other side of the hearth, a lacquered plywood table, which he designed and made, serves for both work and dining. In addition, he expanded the size of the mirrors covering the fireplace wall. ''They visually enlarge the space,'' he says. ''And they reflect light from the one window.''",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,  IN SHORT: FICTION,"DEADLY TRIPLETS: A Theatre Mystery and Journal. By Adrienne Kennedy. (University of Minnesota, $14.95.) For her first novel, the talented playwright Adrienne Kennedy has had the intriguing idea of infusing her theatrical experiences in London with a Gothic sensibility and transforming them into a mystere a clef. With a protagonist who appears to be a thinly disguised substitute for the author, the narrative circles around a female playwright's relationship with a troubled film actor trying his hand at a modern revenge play called ''Deadly Triplets.'' The actor promises to help the playwright unearth the secret of her adopted mother's apparently mysterious death, but instead involves her in his own demise. In spite of Ms. Kennedy's avowed admiration for Conan Doyle, Christie and du Maurier, and in spite of the book's echoes of Charlotte Bronte, even a casual reader of mysteries may sense the author's discomfort with the genre. Omens, portents and presages abound in a volume of just 124 pages; whenever there's a need to heighten tension, a character leaves the country. The mystery of the mother's death is cast aside almost as a red herring, and the central character's present-tense life is left largely undramatized and unexplored. In the end, most of the book's interest turns out to be voyeuristic: one wonders just how much of it is autobiographical. Running throughout is an obsession with fame and famous people, which eventually finds its rightful place in a series of thumbnail sketches appended to the end of the novel. In this ''journal,'' Ms. Kennedy paints precise portraits of such luminaries as Edward Albee, Joseph Losey and Fay Weldon, and tells a classic story of betrayal in the theater. It seems that she had adapted John Lennon's ''nonsense books'' into a play that was eventually given a tryout at the National Theater. Laurence Olivier held her hand throughout the performance, then decided that Lennon, not she, should do the adaptation when the project was resumed a few months later. It is in these sharp sketches and telling anecdotes that Ms. Kennedy's considerable talents are most evident.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Mike Lupica, a columnist for the daily sports newspaper The National, is back with his third mystery featuring Peter Finley, a street-smart, wisecracking New York television journalist. In ''Limited Partner,'' Finley decides to launch an investigation after his friend Bobby Wyman is found dead of a drug overdose. Wyman, a recovering addict and alcoholic, was also part owner of a fashionable Upper East Side watering hole. If he had any doubts, Finley is certain of foul play after Wyman's girlfriend is found dead the day after Wyman's funeral, also of an apparent overdose. The body count builds as Finley's search for his friend's killer takes him from trendy uptown bistros to an after-hours club in Greenwich Village. The trail eventually leads to an Upper West Side substance abuse center, where Finley encounters B. J. Remick, a fireballing New York Mets pitcher who happens to have a cocaine problem, and whose confessions point Finley toward a mildly surprising solution to Wyman's murder.

us,  IN SHORT: FICTION,"ONE FELL SLOOP. By Susan Kenney. (Viking, $16.95.) Forgive the puns, the novel's title being the least painful, with its double - no, triple - meaning. Ignore the parenthetical remarks that pockmark, and often pothole, every page. Overlook the repeated descriptions of the heroine's lover, with his ''tall, broad figure'' and his ''much-too-clever, faunlike face.'' What is left at the heart of Susan Kenney's new mystery is a pleasant howdunit. The third in a series featuring an English professor named Rosamund (Roz) Howard, ''One Fell Sloop'' sets this reluctant sleuth to battle an overbearing Scotsman, Alan Stewart, an intellectually and physically well-endowed paleobotonist, and her own highly developed insecurities during a holiday sail around Maine's Penobscot Bay. It is after a ''flaming row'' (''she had gone up in smoke; he had simply gone ashen'') that the two find a murdered body on the beach of a deserted island, with one set of footprints, apparently those of the deceased. The timing couldn't be better. While local authorities dismiss the death as accidental, Roz and Alan can stow their personal angst and concentrate on solving the who, what, when, where, why and, most important, how of the murder. They do this by engaging in seemingly endless theorizing; interviewing the obligatory eccentric Maine characters; confronting one suspect in an amusing, martini-laced scene, and staging a lovers' reconciliation that signals the start of the novel's worthwhile, action-filled ending.",1990-10-14T05:00:00+0000

''The final test of a man's stature is his capacity for proper exultation,'' writes Kenneth Tynan in his discussion of Graham Greene, one of 50 pieces that make up ''Profiles,'' a collection of Tynan's character sketches, some previously uncollected. For the reader, the final test of these portraits of some of this century's most accomplished personalities may be Tynan's own inexhaustible enthusiasm. A decade after his death, Tynan's theater criticism is still considered second only to George Bernard Shaw's; he brought the same penetrating mind and felicitous pen to his journalism. While he diligently addressed the whos, whats, wheres and whens of each of his subjects, it was the hows and the whys that proved to be Tynan's forte. Through his remarkably broad interests and clarity of expression, he was a master at making the complex easily understandable, be it the paradoxes behind Tom Stoppard's dramas, the intricacies of Ralph Richardson's acting or the typically eccentric compulsion to approach, say, Humphrey Bogart with insights from Seneca. And always to be savored is his way with a phrase: ''What, when drunk, one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.'' ''Miles [Davis] found himself as a musician some seven or eight years ago; and those who find themselves are seldom objects of affection to those who are still seeking.'' Peter Brook ''was never a crusader, and he looks about as neurotic as a chipmunk. Snub, stubby and self-contained, he radiates nothing more alarming than confidence.'' His comment about Shaw - ''Though he took great pains to command respect, he took none at all to inspire affection'' - might be a bit of disguised apologia. But in his feature pieces, Tynan never pontificated or instructed. Rather he commented and informed, enriching his diverse subjects and the era he helped them define with his elegant observations and exquisite prose.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

GUSSOW: What were the origins of ''West Side Story''? BERNSTEIN: In 1949, Jerry Robbins was excited about the idea of doing a musical version of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' and he asked Arthur Laurents and myself to come over and talk about it. He wanted to do it in terms of contemporary slums. His idea of the slums then was the Lower East Side, with the story taking place at the coincidence of Passover and Easter. We thought it was a fine idea. I was a little worried about the ''Abie's Irish Rose'' quality. But I didn't say so at the time.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

If dragging defenseless Marilyn Monroe's already tattered reputation further down in a sleazy sex novel is your idea of reading fun, then George Bernau's second novel may be for you. ''Candle in the Wind is a work of fiction,'' says the author's note. ''Although it is set in what may seem to some readers as a recognizable historical context, its characters - their actions, dialogue and motivations as portrayed by the novel - are entirely imaginary.'' Oh sure; all fiction. Marilyn, the blond sex goddess who is found near death in her Brentwood, Calif., home in August 1962, is called Marilyn Lane. The young, handsome President of the United States is John (Jack) Kerrigan. The Attorney General is his younger brother Tommy, and their Hollywood connection is their brother-in-law, the British-born, alcoholic actor Paul Townsend. It is Townsend who finds Marilyn as she lies dying of an apparent drug overdose; he hires a private eye, Frank Galvan, ostensibly to learn who might have wanted her dead. Galvan and Marilyn (who, thanks to Galvan, has miraculously survived) then set off on a global junket that involves the C.I.A., Chicago Mafiosi and the occupants of the White House, as well as a plot to overthrow the American Government - and, of course, the requisite dose of mostly gratuitous sex. Mr. Bernau, a lawyer and a former film executive, is a proponent of the smash cut; his intricate plot shifts back and forth so fast that one might as well be reading 3-by-5 cards. All this would provide harmless escapism if it were not for the book's ethical ramifications. Even writers are entitled to make a buck, but to do so by exploiting someone who was so troubled is distasteful. Those wishing to read something trenchant about Marilyn Monroe should turn instead to Simone Signoret's memoir, ''Nostalgia Isn't What It Used to Be.'' The French actress, a powerful writer, was married to the actor Yves Montand, who was for a time one of Monroe's lovers.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Jesse Jackson, the once and probably future Presidential aspirant who has lately taken up journalism, has quickly climbed the heights of the profession.

Mr. Jackson narrates the documentary passages, leads the panel discussions, puts questions to members of the studio audience and occasionally addresses the television camera, for instance, when announcing a pause for a commercial. He does not personally deliver the commercials for products, but causes are another matter. In New York, at 9 P.M. on Channel 11, the program finds itself up against Fox's popular ''Married . . . With Children'' and has not been doing nearly as well as Mr. Jackson did in the 1988 primaries.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

One is subliminally aware of the thermal springs, 123 of them, that nourish Budapest's spas and give this east-west city a dreamy water life, democratically offering the soporific warmth of healing waters to all.

While we stood 1,100 feet up mid-C, a stupendous notion had been forming itself in my mind: it formed gradually because it was beyond the proportions of human sense and belief. That letter C, I said to myself - that letter C enclosing a 57-square-mile bay . . . That letter C, in which huge double-funneled ferryboats seem built for bathtub play . . . That C - large enough to hold one full thunderstorm and both Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni islands . . . ''That C,'' I said finally aloud, ''IS A VOLCANO.'' And this volcano transformed Western civilization. For, somewhere in the second millennium B.C., Santorini - also known as Thera - simply blew apart. Half the island disappeared, leaving a vague, giant circle made up of Santorini and two outlying islets, Therasia and Aspronisi. One of the most powerful volcanic explosions in modern times was the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait near Java. It displaced five cubic miles of rock fragments and sent at least one tsunami across to nearby Java. Day became night for 130 miles. Thirty-six thousand people died. Krakatoa was bought for a major motion picture. Yet Thera's crater is more than twice the size of Krakatoa's. And the tsunami generated by Thera was by some estimates as much as 100 feet high when it hit Crete broadside one hour later. Crete is more than 60 miles away.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

In the novel, published in 1897, he located Castle Dracula at the top of the Borgo Pass, on the frontier between Transylvania and Bukovina, ''in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.'' Exploring the region in 1915, the American journalist John Reed marveled at the peasants' folkloric costumes and the rolling carpet of green velvet, shadowed with firs and beech forests, that were just as Stoker had described them. An English traveler, Sacheverell Sitwell, wrote on the eve of World War II: ''In no other district that I have ever visited, be it in Spain or Portugal, in Sweden or the Gaeltacht of Western Ireland, is there this sensation of remoteness . . . a land of green meadows and firwoods. It is at an inconceivable distance from newspaper and tram.'' Last spring, with a backpack weighted down by a copy of ''Dracula'' and several out-of-print travel books about Romania, I journeyed by foot, donkey cart, second-class train and a lucky hitchhiker's forefinger through almost every region of the country. (In Romania, the forefinger rather than the thumb is used for hitchhiking.) I often encountered a landscape savaged by concrete, begrimed by factory smoke and disturbed by unruly alcoholism. But in Romania's northeast extremity - the Bukovina (''beech-covered land'') region of Moldavia that unrolled from the back windows of Count Dracula's castle - I found a paradisiacal remnant of early-century Europe, which, because of the very geographical remoteness noted by Stoker, Sitwell and others, has largely escaped the social and environmental ravages of Communism.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

You get three tries and win a prize of a stuffed doll if you can get the chicken into the pot. Sound like fun? Some people think it is. These two middle-aged couples I ran across a few weeks ago at Circus Circus, a huge pink-and-white box of a casino on the Strip in Las Vegas, Nev., that features circus performers and carnival attractions, were thoroughly enjoying themselves. ''We was here last night and he hit three in a row,'' one of the women informed me, as her husband brought the mallet crashing down and propelled another bird into the air.

Until recently, rapping was almost exclusively a men's club, but a wave of women rappers appeared in the late 1980's and is gathering force. The first group - Queen Latifah, M. C. Lyte, Roxanne Shante - generally took the high road, ignoring the violent talk and blunt, unexamined sexism of most male rappers. But in the last year, the 2 Live Crew have gained wide notoriety for their lewd raps, while gangster rap has hitched its tales of urban violence to an increasingly vicious misogyny; when Ice-T describes himself as ''the bitch killer'' to glorify his outlaw persona, someone has to talk back. Female rappers are still greatly outnumbered, but they're beginning to speak up directly against macho bluster, and to remind the rap audience that women aren't exclusively ''bitches,'' ''hoes'' (whores) or sex-crazed ''freaks,'' as too many male rappers pretend.",1990-10-21T05:00:00+0000

This would make the turbine competitive in cost with natural gas, oil, coal and nuclear power, but without the environmental impact. The new turbine has three blades, each 54 feet long, with a rotor diameter of 106 feet, nearly twice that of previous models. The generator has a rating of 300 kilowatts. Unlike previous models, which can be damaged if operated in winds that are too high, U.S. Windpower said, the turbine has an electronically controlled gearbox enabling it to operate safely in high or variable winds.

The porches were always designed by that master of heartland lyricism John Lee Beatty, and they would usually be the setting for moonlit revelations of family scars and ambisexual love triangles, reliably punctuated by the nattering of crickets. For one playwright -- Lanford Wilson, in the Talley trilogy -- the Circle Rep porches were a platform for myth, history and passion. You could take the measure of the country in a play like ""The Fifth of July.""

The 18-year-old Chang started brilliantly, breaking Lendl twice in the opening set. But Lendl, ranked third in the world, rallied to take the next two sets with ease. Chang won only one of five service games in the third set. The third-seeded Chang, who beat Lendl in a five-set match in the fourth round of last year's French Open, could not duplicate that performance. He lost his serve in the fifth and seventh games of the fourth set, helping Lendl win the set and the match. Lendl collected $200,000. Chang, ranked 14th, received $100,000.

When the 1-hour-38-minute match ended, Jarryd punched the air in a victory salute, knowing he had recorded his fourth surprise victory of the tournament and staged an important personal comeback. Because of injury, Jarryd had dropped to 175th in the A.T.P. ranking this year from fifth in 1985. (AP) First Indoor Title for Rosset: Marc Rosset of Switzerland won his first indoor title, beating Mats Wilander of Sweden, 6-3, 6-2, yesterday in the $500,000 Lyons Grand Prix tournament in France. The 19-year-old Rosset dominated Wilander, a former No. 1 player who is in a two-year slump. Rosset got off to a slow start in the first set, but a double-fault and forced error by Wilander gave him a service break at 5-3 en route to winning the set. Wilander managed to save two match points in the second set at 5-2, before losing.

Trevino's final-round seven-under-par 65 earned him $75,000. He finished the 54 holes on the 6,632-yard Silverado Country Club south course at 205, 11 under par. Hill, who also shot 65, had five birdies on his back nine and entered the clubhouse the leader at nine under. But Trevino birdied Nos. 14, 17 and 18 to win.

Martin has to finish third or better in the remaining two races, at Phoenix and Atlanta, to clinch the championship. Martin, who started 21st just behind Earnhardt, got no closer than ninth place during a cloudy and cool afternoon. Earnhardt was as close as sixth after 180 laps, but he dropped a lap to the leaders late in the race and never got it back.

Favors providing land for low-income housing and placing it beyond overpopulated low-income neighborhoods and providing ""every advantage you can in financing."" Favors a constitutional amendment that would empower counties to build affordable housing. Opposes means test for tenants in rent-controlled or stabilized apartments. Oppose letting rents rise to market levels when tenants of those apartments move. Herbert London, Conservative: ""The primary feature of housing should be for the state to provide vouchers to those people who are very poor and to encourage through tax abatements for the construction oflow income housing in the private sector. One incentive I think, makes an awful lot of sense is to use municipal buildings, particularly schools, as places for new contruction -- that is, build on top of a school. If you gave the sites away and said to people, put up a building over the school -- but it has to be a low income, middle income housing project -- that would clearly be possible largely because you've provided a free site."" Pierre A. Rinfret, Republican: ""All the projects that go from 96th Street right up to 124th Street, I'd sell every one of those to the residents."" Would finance new, affordable housing projects, all co-operatives, by public borrowing supported by rents from occupants who would receive subsidized mortgages. ""Build homogenous neighborhoods which are not these very high-rise buildings"" and place them outside lower income areas ""if I can't find the land"" elsewhere. Louis P. Wein, Right to Life: Favors more low-density housing ""integrated into many communities as opposed to isolated into groups."" Favors programs patterned on the H.E.L.P. program initiated by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, tax credits and incentives and providing ""all the ancillary services that are required to help these people as part of a society that cares about them."" Proposes a means test for rent controlled apartments, based not only on a tenant's salary. Philosophically opposed to rent controls ""but there would be so much social dislocation and so much panic thatthe good that may come of that would be a disservice."" ABORTION: Cuomo: He has supported a woman's right to abortion and Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women, but says ""it is too complicated to deal with in 28 second sound bites. It took me 7,000 words to describe it in an address to the Department of Theology at Notre Dame University. I can't reconfigure it to meet someone else's editing standards. It is too important for that."" Rinfret: ""I'm pro-choice. I'm not pro-abortion. Pro-choice means giving the woman the right to make the decision. She then has to deal with herself, her conscience, her religion if she has one. I support state funding for the poor who are unable to pay for an abortion ""because I don't want them doing wire abortions or stick abortions."" Would impose a residency requirement, though, ""because I don't want to attract everybody from outside the state."" London: ""I am pro-life. What enobles the life of the individual woman, enobles the life she's carrying. I'm willing to tolerate exceptions, incest, rape and the life of the mother. I'm opposed to Medicaid funding for abortion. I don't think that the state should be in the business of promoting abortion. Wein: ""I am opposed to abortion without exception. I would do everything I could within the law to get the law changed."" DRUG TREATMENT: Cuomo: Favors treatment on demand for drug addicts, but says ""we're very far away from it"" because of financial contraints. London: Supports treatment on demand. ""If you found treatment programs that work I would be very much in favor of them only because I think you would lower the expense from other areas of the state budget, including crime prevention and the court system."" Favors random drug testing of applicants for drivers licenses and denying licenses to those who test positive. Rinfret: Says ""we have concentrated on the jails and not on the rehabilitation centers. We have 17,000 roughly backlog of people waiting to get in, can't get in, so they're still on the streets. If theinvestigation of the family shows its totally incapable of affording this, then the state, in my judgment, has to pay. I want them off the streets. I'd rather have themin rehabilitation centers where there's a shot at them."" Wein: Favors drug treatment on demand while also treating the causes of drug addiction in hospital and other existing facilities. MENTAL HEALTH: Cuomo: Favors a more ""intelligent application of police power"" to remove mentally ill people from streets. ""I'm not sure that there isn't more room in the Constitution for an intelligent application of police power that would enable you to protect people from injuring themselves, even if they're not going to kill themselves."" London: Says more people should be in mental hospitals. ""The state has abdicated its responsibility largely because I don't understand how it's a humanitarian policy to say to someonewith mental illness, here's your Thorazine, take it every four hours and live on the streets of New York City."" Rinfret: Favors some legal provision under which people being treated for severe psychiatric problems can be required to take prescribed medicine. Wein: ""When people are incapable of taking care of themselves you should have some form of commitment."" SUNY TUITION: Cuomo: Suggests that tuition can be raised, but opposes a means test that would require someone who could afford it to pay the full cost: ""What would it do if you charged everybody who could afford $15,000, which ones would go to S.U.N.Y. instead of the private schools? I believe we consider the question of tuition. And we do have means tests now. If you're saying we should convert it, in effect, to a private system in terms of financing it, no I disapprove of that."" London: Favors a policy of basing tuition on a student's ability to pay. Rinfret: ""I would increase the tuition fees"" and would impose a means test. ""And I'm a student who went to C.C.N.Y. and had no money. I would have a means test. I got in there for free, but I didn't have a nickel."" Wein: Favors means test that would base tuition on a student's ability to pay.",1990-10-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Congress: A Status Report,"Legislation that the leaders of the 101st Congress say they have to pass before adjourning for electioneering, legislation that they hope to pass and legislation that has few prospects of passage this year. WHAT CONGRESS MUST DO The Budget: Known as a budget reconciliation bill, this huge measure will incorporate the new taxes and cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs agreed to by Congressional and White House budget agreement negotiators. Appropriations: In addition, 13 appropriations bill have to be approved in order to continue funding Government programs and agencies for another year. These bills range from one that sets defense spending for the Pentagon to one that pays for attorneys and secretaries in the Justice Department. Clean Air: House and Senate negtiators have agreed on all major issues of the first rewriting of clean air legislation 13 years. It calls for tougher emission standards on automobiles, and measures that will reduce urban smog, chemicals that damage the ozone shield and release of industrial chemicals said to cause cancer. The White House expressed concern about the cost but appears prepared to sign the legislation. Child Care: The White House and the Senate reached an agreement on the first child care package since 1971. It would give $15 billion in tax breaks to the poor to pay for child care, and grants to states to set safety and health standards for child care centers. A package is being negotiated with the House. Farm Programs: Legislation that would extend farm prices supports for five years has become entangled in the budget agreement, because the House and Senate bills would cut farm programs. Last week a conference agreement was reached that would cut price support programs by $13 billion. WHAT CONGRESS WOULD LIKE TO DO Crime: Legislation that would reduce the number of appeals and petitions for prisoners on death row and the burden of proof for prosectors seeking to impose the capital punishment has passed both the Senate and House, but has yet to go to a conference. White House generally pleased with the final product, but one House provision, which would enable a court to overturn a death sentence if the defendent could show a pattern of racial discrimination in that state, could doom the bill. Immigration: House and Senate have each passed bills that would increase legal immigration. Senate would set a limit of 630,000, the House, almost 800,000. Preference would be given to family members of immigrants who have permanent residents status, as well as highly educated workers, in an effort to bring more skilled workers into the country. In conference, an agreement has been set to increase the current immigration level of 540,000 to 700,000 for the first three years, then 675,000 after that. Visas for skilled workers would rise to 140,000 annually from 54,000. Housing: House and Senate conferees have agreed to a bill that would spend $17.9 billion next year on three major new housing programs. They include the Administration's HOPE program, to help low-income workers buy their own apartments or homes, construction of new low-rental housing units and overhauling of the troubled Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance fund by revamping premiums. WHAT CONGRESS IS NOT LIKELY TO DO Campaign Finance: Both House and Senate passed legislation that would change how political campaigns are financed. House would cap spending on Congressional races at $550,000 per candidate for the general election, offer free broadcast time and reduce mailing costs. Senate would ban politicl action committees, require states to set campaign spending limits, and offer low-cost mailing, free television time and extra money for candidates whose opponents exceed spending limits. The bill is considered dead. Cable Television: A bill that would have imposed modest new regulations on the cable television industry, and require cable operators to share their programming with competitors, was passed by the House but blocked in the Senate. While last minute negotiations last week sparked hopes for a revival of the bill, a host of proposed amendments that could consume precious legislative time seemed to doom the bill for this year. An even bigger obstacle is a threatened veto by President Bush.",1990-10-24T05:00:00+0000

Are We Better Off Now?","PROSPERITY LOST. By Philip Mattera. (Addison-Wesley, $19.95.) Ronald Reagan got himself elected President in 1980 by asking Americans if they were better off than they had been four years earlier. The wonder is that after the subsequent two terms of radical, greed-driven economic policy -- Philip Mattera calls it a coup d'etat born of an unprecedented alliance of business, the Federal Government and the political right -- George Bush was able to convince American voters they were a prosperous lot. ""Prosperity Lost"" meticulously chronicles the downward plunge in the American standard of living, mostly during the Reagan years, an erosion that affects all but the wealthiest among us. Median income in 1987 was $30,853, just $33 above the adjusted 1973 figure. Meanwhile, real estate prices soared -- making the 1980's the first postwar decade in which home ownership rates declined. Many who can afford to buy homes emulate an unnamed southern California employee of a defense contractor mentioned by Mr. Mattera who sleeps in his car several nights a week instead of making the two-hour commute to an affordable home. The cost of a private college education rose by 50 percent in the 1980's (public college costs went up by about 33 percent), partly as a result of the colleges picking up the slack from cuts in Federal student aid. As manufacturing jobs have diminished, high-paid union workers have no option but to take low-paying, low-benefits service-industry jobs -- or even to become part of the contingency work force of short-timers, temps or sub-minimum-wage homeworkers. One result: some 31 million Americans are without any form of health insurance; about 40 percent of those who work are not included in employment-based health insurance. To support these endless statistics, Mr. Mattera, a former reporter for Fortune, includes anecdotes, many of them drawn from Congressional testimony, so the effect of ""Prosperity Lost"" is a rude awakening from the American dream. The major culprits: two Republican Administrations and big business. As his Administration was cutting housing subsidies, Mr. Mattera charges, Mr. Reagan was portraying homelessness as an unfortunate side effect of deinstitutionalization. Meanwhile, corporations were demanding wage concessions from labor unions that even some businessmen publicly admitted were unnecessary. Mr. Mattera calls for a return to the days when the Government better addressed the social needs of its citizens with average and below-average incomes and kept business in line. In the end, he suggests some options that he admits are utopian, such as establishing a ""maximum wage"" to control the excessive accumulation of wealth at the top; encouraging the development of aggressive labor unions in the third world to shore up global wages; offering some relief for domestic debtors; and that near-forgotten ideal, giving everyone a guaranteed income.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENTS/RECORDINGS NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"Total Recall 1990. Carolco/LIVE. $24.99. Laser disk, $39.95. 1 hour, 53 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Paul Verhoeven's super-violent film melds the ""ever-more-workable Arnold Schwarzenegger mystique with a better-than-average science fiction premise."" Tortured by inexplicable memories of another life on Mars, Paul Quaid (Mr. Schwarzenegger) goes there to investigate. Though the number of plot reversals almost equals the body count, ""Mr. Verhoeven has come up with a vigorous interplanetary thriller that packs in wallops with metronomic regularity."" (Janet Maslin) Wild Orchid 1990. RCA/Columbia. $89.95. LD, $34.95. CC. 1:57, unrated ; 1:51, R. Emily (Carre Otis) goes to work for Claudia (Jacqueline Bisset), a tough-talking businesswoman, in Rio de Janeiro, where, after much hemming and hawing, she is at last ravaged by a persistent businessman (Mickey Rourke). ""Early in his career, Mr. Rourke managed this sort of thing very seductively. This time he seems puffy, sleazy, well over the edge into self-parody"" in a film that proves ""just how tedious and coy a soft-core porn film can be."" (Maslin) Miami Blues 1990. Orion. $89.98. LD, $39.95. 1:37. CC. R. In line with Charles Willeford's crackerjack crime novels, on which the George Armitage film is based, the role of peculiar central character should fall to the police detective Hoke Mosely (Fred Ward); instead it's left to the slightly crazed sociopath Junior Frenger (Alec Baldwin), who tries his best aided and fed by a cooking-obsessed hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh). ""The film is best appreciated for the performances of its stars and its scene-stealing peripheral touches."" (Maslin) Love at Large 1990. Orion. $89.98. LD, $39.95. 1:37. CC. R. A band of lovelorn, soft-hearted adventurers rearrange their romantic destinies over and over again. Tom Berenger is gruffly amusing as a private detective; Anne Archer is the wounded, mesmerizing beauty around whom the story revolves, and Elizabeth Perkins makes a starchy foe of romantic treachery. The director Alan Rudolph ""operates on the cinema's dog-whistle frequencies, emitting a signal that's perceptible to only a select few."" (Maslin) Strapless 1990. RCA/Columbia. $79.95. LD, $34.95. 2:12. CC. R. David Hare's film stars Blair Brown and Bridget Fonda as American sisters caught up in injudicious romances, which, by way of the playwrights' social and political concerns, are tied to alleged inequities of life in Margaret Thatcher's England. Treating the sisters ""much in the way a politically liberal housewife might treat her servants,"" Mr. Hare ""is ruthless in the manner in which he shapes his characters to fit larger points."" (Vincent Canby) Jetsons: The Movie 1990. MCA/Universal. $22.95. LD, $34.98. 1:22. CC. G. Despite space-age gadgetry, the futuristic Jetsons on the big screen remain the mid-50's happy family they've been since William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's animated TV show was first aired in 1962. On evidence of the Hanna-Barbera movie, life decades hence will be several steps behind what it is today. Bright and perky, the film ""isn't any more fascinating than the cartoon series. It's only longer."" (Maslin)",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

This is a pop biography of a man who lived much of his life as if preparing to be the subject of one. Whether capitalistically tooling around the country with his motorcycle club, the Capitalist Tools, or playing with his famous hot-air balloons, or throwing a $2 million party in Morocco in honor of his 70th birthday, or hanging out with Elizabeth Taylor and slyly refusing to deny that their probably innocent friendship was a love affair, Malcolm Forbes adored publicity and was a master at getting it. Certainly Forbes magazine, over which he inherited complete control after the death of his brother Bruce in 1964, thrived on its owner's image. But Christopher Winans, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, seems more interested in the image than the man. He skims over large chunks of his subject's life and spends an inordinate amount of time teasing his readers with the widespread rumors of Forbes's homosexuality. Though Mr. Winans finally provides confirmation of these rumors in interviews with a number of Forbes's purported sexual partners, it is hard to see his homosexuality as more than a minor factor in Forbes's life and work. Mr. Winans's anecdotes of the workings and politics of the magazine are lively and informative but scant, and in many of them Forbes seems to have played at most a peripheral role. What will stick in the reader's memory is a collage of balloons, parties and Elizabeth Taylor -- just as Malcolm Forbes would have wanted it.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

Salter was writing about his friend Irwin Shaw, whose name, once renowned, has slipped quietly from the first rank. Where will the tireless, indifferent clerks file the name James Salter? His readers, few in number but adamant in their conviction that he is a great writer, are confident that the author of ""A Sport and a Pastime"" and ""Dusk: And Other Stories,"" the collection that won him the 1988 PEN/Faulkner Award (perhaps this country's most prestigious literary prize), will eventually take his place in the canon of American literature.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

""How do you get to Carnegie Hall?"" asks the old chestnut, to which the answer is, of course, ""Practice, practice, practice."" In ""Grit, Guts, and Genius,"" the USA Today business reporters John Hillkirk and Gary Jacobson asked the equivalent question of a number of successful executives in business, sports and entertainment. The authors found eight common themes: ""Trust your gut,"" ""Make the complex simple,"" ""Tap the power of every individual,"" ""Sell fantasy and reassure people,"" ""Tap the power of information,"" ""Master quality,"" ""Target, target, target"" and ""March at a slow and steady pace."" Despite these catchy phrases, many of the answers that come through in the 27 relentlessly upbeat profiles gathered here aren't particularly complex. The key ingredients seem to be talent, old-fashioned hard work, detailed planning and an emphasis on quality, along with a can-do attitude, a good sense of timing, an ability to gauge calculated risks and a little luck. Some of the most interesting figures included are offbeat choices: New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown; the educator Peter Kline; the Pulitzer Prize-winning Philadelphia Inquirer investigative reporters Donald Bartlett and James Steele, and Tom Galla, who coached his Trumbull, Conn., All Stars to the Little League World Series championship.

Arnold Harris is the kind of managerial authority one imagines Leona Helmsley consulted. ""Someone once said, 'You learn from your mistakes,' "" he says. ""He doesn't work here any more."" Harris is a real capitalist's capitalist: he chomps on his cigar, he bellows memos, and come Christmas Eve he wheedles a deal out of Santa. The protagonist of ""Two-Fisted Management,"" Harris is the cartoonist Mark Marek's embodiment of the combined corporate and personal profit motive that rings through every how-to business book. ""You'll learn how to survive and succeed with just your own two hands (and the sweaty hands of those who work under you),"" he promises. ""I guarantee it or your money ba . . . well, I guarantee it."" Harris comes equipped for class war. To bully employees out of a raise, he counsels you to stare at them silently for seven cartoon frames. (""Mind over money,"" he says.) To dress for success, he recommends you wear a decoy contract up your sleeve and a semiautomatic staple gun on your hip. To decorate the power office, he advises you hide metal detectors, cameras and strategically located land mines. When he commandeers a bus to get to a meeting (the driver won't stop in the financial district), Harris tells a worried employee: ""This isn't a game, Davis. This is free enterprise! You're gonna have casualties."" Harris is adaptable; he calls business in the 90's ""New Age Moneygrubbing,"" in which ""we are one (in all but salary)."" Um, well, yes. Exactly.

us,BOOKS & BUSINESS: In Short,"MOUNTAINS OF DEBT: Crisis and Change in Renaissance Florence, Victorian Britain, and Postwar America. By Michael Veseth. (Oxford University, $29.95.) Both Florence and Britain were, at different times, the most admired economic powers in the world. Yet both tumbled off their pedestals. Why? In his academic study, ""Mountains of Debt,"" Michael Veseth, an economist at the University of Puget Sound, points to public debt and government tax policies. Renaissance Florence not only borrowed from its citizens to finance wars and government services but even established a dowry fund to insure the marriageability of their daughters. Eventually the government had to pay such high interest rates that Florentines found it more profitable to invest in public debt than in the productive economy. Meanwhile, a tax loophole discouraged private savings and encouraged spending on lavish homes. Ironically, some of the great art of the Renaissance was made possible in part by this misguided tax policy. By the 1630's, Florence's economy was shattered. Victorian Britain's problem, Mr. Veseth contends, was precisely the opposite: a ""compulsive need to achieve fiscal balance."" As a result, the Government clung to a tax policy with what he calls one ""fatal flaw."" Because it made no provision for capital depreciation, it stunted the growth of modern industries. By the 1870's, he contends, Britain was no longer a major economic force. Both Florence and Britain, Mr. Veseth writes, could have prevented their falls had they acted at a critical point. He sees the debt-laden United States at just such a point, teetering on its economic pedestal. Among his recommendations: raise individual tax rates, remove tax incentives that encourage borrowing and establish a national sales tax. The new taxes would go toward reducing the budget deficit, improving education and building a high-quality service sector -- the nation's last, best hope for remaining competitive.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

What Is a Woman Worth?","A WOMAN'S WAGE: Historical Meanings and Social Consequences. By Alice Kessler-Harris. (University Press of Kentucky, $19.) Pay women what they need and men what they are worth. That was once considered wage justice, Alice Kessler-Harris points out in this instructive collection of essays. With clarity, sense and only a little jargon, Ms. Kessler-Harris, a professor of history at Temple University, examines early 20th-century campaigns for a female minimum wage (resolved by New Deal legislation mandating wage minimums for both sexes), the battle for equal pay that culminated in passage of the 1963 Equal Pay Act, and current debates about comparable worth. The marketplace does not transcend social mores, she stresses in ""A Woman's Wage""; it is immersed in them. White men have generally been paid more for their work than women and black men, in deference to traditional gender roles and social prejudice -- not because of some value-free law of supply and demand. The ideal of a male-headed family demanded that men be paid enough to support their wives and children, while women were paid less than enough to support themselves, she writes. Lower wage rates for women were also justified by myths about women's character: they were said to require more supervision because they were especially sensitive; they were considered able to survive on less because they were used to ""drudgery""; and their fiscal irresponsibility supposedly made them apt to squander surplus income on fripperies. That some women shared these ideals did not make them less discriminatory. Still, wage policy reforms have complex and varying effects on various individual workers, as Ms. Kessler-Harris notes. Comparable worth, for example -- the equation of male and female jobs -- is part of a larger transformation of gender roles with some far-reaching, less than certain consequences. Ms. Kessler-Harris poses hard, pressing questions about wage justice and provides the historical perspective that is needed to answer them.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

The business manager's bible of the 1980's, ""In Search of Excellence,"" pinpointed ways for companies to become more successful, but it did not explain exactly why some very successful companies fail. In ""The Icarus Paradox,"" Danny Miller, a Canadian professor of business administration, tackles the reasons for failure and develops the thesis that the very traits that make some highfliers so successful can later lead to their undoing. His message: Beware the ""perils of excellence."" Mr. Miller identifies four common ""trajectories"" that lead to corporate declines. ""Craftsmen"" like Digital Equipment's Ken Olsen focus so hard on their products that they become ""tinkerers"" and lose sight of their markets. ""Builders"" like I.T.T.'s Harold Geneen become so obsessed with expansion that they become out-of-control ""imperialists."" Inventor ""pioneers"" such as Polaroid's Edwin Land become ""escapists"" who lose sight of all business reality and develop impractical, exorbitant products. And ""salesmen"" -- brilliant marketers like those at Proctor & Gamble -- become ""drifters"" who start to believe they can sell anything, even the most mediocre products. Mr. Miller details the strategies of these companies and others, such as General Motors, I.B.M., A.& P. and Walt Disney, and then analyzes their declines (and, in some cases, their comebacks). He suggests ways to avoid similar troubles and even provides a detailed self-assessment questionnaire for readers. Unfortunately, the book reads like an academic thesis, because all of Mr. Miller's research is based on readings from various business publications, not his own legwork or interviews. But for executives concerned about maintaining the vitality and viability of their businesses, this book will provide some valuable insight into how to stay focused on the essential.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial, ran his business by this principle. T. W. Kang, an executive with Intel Japan, suggests that American manufacturers who want to do business in Japan might learn a thing or two from Matsushita. Why, he asks, do Americans try to sell products Japanese customers do not need? A refrigerator manufacturer, apparently unfamiliar with tiny Japanese apartments, bombed with its big American models. Japanese manufacturers, on the other hand, deftly accommodate consumer preferences. Automobile makers, for example, easily provide consumers with steering wheels on either the right or left. Product-related problems are just the beginning of the pitfalls awaiting unsuspecting foreigners, Mr. Kang warns. It is not easy to staff subsidiary offices in Japan, he says, because most Japanese prefer the job-for-life security of Japanese companies. Finding distribution outlets for American products is even worse: Japanese manufacturers often own significant parts of their distributors and do not take kindly to giving American companies access. What's an American to do? Unfortunately, Mr. Kang often pokes holes in his suggestions even as he explains them. Headhunters, for example, may be able to find less security-minded Japanese to work in American subsidiaries. Then again, he tells us, this could backfire because these people often cannot work within Japan's group-thinking constraints and therefore may not be able to work any better with the Japanese than Americans do. Mr. Kang warns that even if the Japanese Government acts to open up its closed markets, such action will mean nothing if Americans cannot match Japan's low cost, high quality and superb customer service.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,BOOKS & BUSINESS: In Short,"THE AGE OF UNREASON. By Charles Handy. (Harvard Business School, $18.95.) This mild-mannered book is a cousin to the megatrendy future studies popularized by John Naisbitt and Ken Dychtwald. The central tenet of Charles Handy's philosophy is that society in general, and the work place in particular, are in the grip of ""discontinuous"" changes, transformations so basic and so profound that the past is of no use in preparing for the future. The useful thing about this approach, of course, is that it permits one to dispense with entire boxcars of historical experience that might muddle one's arguments. Perhaps people in the past tended to behave a certain way -- tilling their own fields more assiduously than their landlords', for example, or seeking power at the expense of their neighbors. But come tomorrow, Mr. Handy, a visiting professor at the London Business School, says in ""The Age of Unreason,"" we are all going to start behaving differently, because of the inevitable side effects of such profound changes as the telephone line, which permits people in scattered locations to work together. But is the advent of the telephone truly ""discontinuous"" change? Or is it just another stage in an organic continuum that began with drumbeats and smoke signals? If it is the latter, perhaps some small clues to where we are headed can be found by examining where we have been. It is this historical sextant that is lacking in Mr. Handy's various visions of our economic and social future. The result is that his musings, while compassionate and sometimes imaginative, soon begin to seem like just so much cotton candy: inoffensively sweet, briefly entertaining, but far too insubstantial to chew on.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,BOOKS & BUSINESS: In Short,"THE MACHINE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD. By James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos. (Rawson Associates, $22.50.) Although the title of ""The Machine That Changed the World"" refers to the automobile, the main theme is not a machine but a system of manufacturing the authors call ""lean production."" The system was pioneered after World War II by Toyota, and the authors champion it with the passion of zealots: ""Lean production is a superior way for humans to make things. It provides better products in wider variety at lower cost. . . . It provides more challenging and fulfilling work for employees at every level. . . . It follows that the whole world should adopt lean production as quickly as possible."" The authors -- James P. Womack, research director of the International Motor Vehicle Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Daniel T. Jones, the European research director of the program, and Daniel Roos, the program's director -- led a five-year study of the car industry at M.I.T. They characterize lean production as the successor to Henry Ford's mass-production techniques, in which production uses less of everything compared with mass production -- fewer workers, lower amounts of inventory, fewer vendors and drastically reduced design and assembly time. Workers have more individual responsibility for quality control and are expected to handle many different jobs and develop team loyalty. Ford gets high marks for introducing lean production practices; General Motors is criticized for its slowness to adapt. While the authors make a strong case, readers will be distracted by their insistent, self-congratulatory tone and their constant references to the exhaustive nature of their research and the extraordinary implications of their findings. And the labored, choppy narrative style is about what one would expect from a text written by a committee. Nevertheless, the book provides compelling data about the advantages enjoyed by lean producers.",1990-10-28T05:00:00+0000

Saying that Mr. Barry had ""given aid, comfort and encouragement to the drug culture"" by using cocaine for five years and lying about it, the judge sentenced him to six months in prison and a year of probation. ""His prominence inspired others to emulate him and to behave as they believed he did,"" the judge said. The Mayor said he wasn't surprised at the severity of the sentence.

Wendel Clark's goal at 13 minutes 36 seconds of the third period had forged a 4-4 tie. Toronto, 2-10-1, ended a four-game losing streak. It was the Leafs' first game since Tom Watt was named head coach on a permanent basis Monday. Neal Broten had two goals for the North Stars, 2-7-4, who remained without a victory in seven road games. (AP) Blues 5, Red Wings 2: Brett Hull broke a second-period tie with his league-leading 15th goal as the St. Louis Blues extended their unbeaten streak to seven games with a victory over the Red Wings in Detroit. Dave Lowry added two goals for St. Louis (8-3-1), which posted its fourth straight victory while ending the Red Wings' (6-4-3) six-game home-ice winning streak. After Gerard Gallant tied the score at 2-2 midway through the second period, Hull, left unattended in front of the Detroit net, converted a centering pass from Rod Brind'Amour for his 11th goal in the last six games. (AP) Penguins 6, Flyers 2: Mark Recchi had a goal and three assists and Frank Pietrangelo stopped 33 shots for his fourth straight victory as the Flyers' losing streak reached four games. Pittsburgh (6-6-1) won its second straight game and third in its last four. The game marked the return of the Flyer right wing Tim Kerr, who played in his first game since his wife Kathy died Oct. 16 from complications of child birth. He missed the team's last six games. Kerr, who received a brief standing ovation on his first shift, was stopped by Pietrangelo on a pad save just outside the crease at 7:40 of the opening period. Philadelphia (6-6-0) outshot the Penguins, 24-10, through the first two periods, but Pietrangelo kept Pittsburgh in the game with numerous key saves. Kevin Stevens gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead when he took a cross-ice pass from league-leading scorer John Cullen, faked the goalie, Ken Wregget, and flicked a shot past Wregget's stick side at 5:49 of the first period. A minute later, Rob Brown took a pass from Bob Errey, who had two assists, from behind the net and fired a shot past Wregget in the slot at 6:49. Joe Mullen scored his 10th goal of the season and seventh on the power play for a 5-1 advantage when he pushed a shot over Wregget's stick side at 6:45 of the final period.
