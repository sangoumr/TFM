In addition, educators foresee a new minority ''brain drain,'' as outstanding students who do win acceptance opt for rival states, driven away by fears of racial isolation. The new segregation endangers the social coherence of both Texas and California. Educators and political leaders will need to work vigorously to reopen educational access and avoid long-term division.",1997-06-01T05:00:00+0000

Since I did not ask for the new toilet and was told I had to allow it, I sent a bill to the board of directors and the managing agent asking to be reimbursed. They sent me a letter saying that since I was an owner, it was my responsibility. Do I have any recourse in this matter? . . . Selma S. Citrin, Forest Hills.",1997-06-01T05:00:00+0000

Prowling around the north transept of St. Mary's Collegiate Church in Youghal, County Cork, one afternoon, I was surprised to find a large, rounded-off pyramid of earth surrounded by an iron railing marking a famine grave. Sir Walter Raleigh is said to have introduced the potato to Ireland next door in the garden of his mansion, Myrtle Grove. In Kilmallock, County Tipperary, a huge expanse of prime real estate stands empty in the middle of a housing development, and in lush pastures above the town of Callan in County Kilkenny, one field of green has been landscaped as a memorial to the dead buried there. Many famine burial grounds bear no markers. In Dunfanaghy on the north coast of Donegal, townspeople directed me to a triangular yard of grassy mounds on a hill overlooking the bay.

Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of its esteemed, revered and beloved Rabbi Alexander Sender Linchner, zecher tzadik livrocho. Rabbi Linchner was a visionary who devoted his every thought, action and moment to Toras Yisroel, Am Yisroel and Eretz Yisroel. Inspired and guided by his legendary father-in-law, Reb Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, zt''l, founder of Torah U'Mesorah, and spiritual force behind virtually every major institution of Torah, Rabbi Linchner set out with a passionate commitment to teach and inspire Jewish youth, both here and in Israel. As a young American yeshiva student, he went to pre-war Europe to study with the sainted Chofetz Chaim, whose love for the Jewish People would continue to inspire Rabbi Linchner throughout his life. He returned to the U.S. only to be devastated at the loss of six million Jews, particularly one and a half million innocent children. He was permanently affected by the Nazis carefully orchestrated plan to bring about the spiritual demise of the Jewish People by systematically murdering the Roshei Yeshiva, rabbis and Torah scholars and destroying of all of Europe's Torah centers, cities, towns and shtetlach. He viewed himself as a Holocaust survivor, committing his life to restore the Jewish People to their glory-primarily through its youth-return Torah learning to its primacy and build the Land of Israel. Profoundly influenced by Rabbi Shamshon Raphael Hirsch's philosophy of Torah im Derech Eretz, he founded Boys Town Jerusalem where he would teach students that they stood in the place of that lost generation of Jewish children and would inspire them to carry on with our timeless Torah heritage. Rabbi Linchner nurtured Boys Town not just as a school, but as a movement. Its 5,000 graduates have taken the value system imbued in them to virtually every Israeli city, town and village which now bears indelible imprint of the sterling character and values of Rabbi Linchner and his revered and sainted mentors, the G'doley Yisroel. Most important, he touched the lives of countless Israeli youth, giving them hope, opportunity and the means to lead a self-respecting life as they collectively build the Land of Israel while molding its spiritual fibre. The Jewish People have suffered an irreplaceable loss. Our ultimate tribute to Rabbi Linchner-who never compromised principle by remaining steadfast to the Torah-will be through our rededication to the tangible expression of his lifelong mission of perpetuating the timeless values of Torah im Eretz Yisroel, Boys Town Jerusalem. Boruch attoh b'voecho, u'voruch attoh b'tzaysecho. We express our heartfelt sympathy to Rebbetzin Linchner, Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Mrs. Naomi Rothstein, his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and his cherished extended family, the Boys Town Jerusalem mishpocho. Hamakom yinachem eschem besoch shaar a'velay Tzion v'Yerushalayim. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Michael J. Scharf, President Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec. V.P.",1997-06-06T05:00:00+0000

us,His Father's Son,"Anyone who buys JUNIOR: Griffey on Griffey (Collins, cloth, $45; paper, $25) is probably crazy about Ken Griffey Jr. already, and will devour Walter Iooss Jr.'s photographs. But say you're just curious about this 27-year-old center fielder for the Seattle Mariners who is hitting home runs this season at a better clip than Roger Maris was maintaining in 1961. You will find one dutiful, determined young man who is prone to exasperation. He gets a little tired of public attention, finds that autograph signing can get a famous person into trouble and, in his introduction to life in the clubhouse, explains in extralarge type, ''I just don't like people touching my stuff.'' And while he is unfailingly polite, his compliments tend to the backhanded. Tsk-tsking that his teammate Alex Rodriguez does not get as much attention as he should, Mr. Griffey says: ''From Day 1, they labeled me the 'Savior of Baseball' in Seattle. With Alex, you heard about how he was a great shortstop that could come in and help Ken Griffey.'' ''Junior'' does show a moving gratitude for the huge presence of Ken Griffey Sr., who never minded a 2 A.M. phone call (even about non-baseball stuff) from his son and who to this day will give his son a call in the dugout. It would be surprising if an amazing athlete, having been raised rich and talented and special and scooped into the majors at the age of 19, did emerge with much wit and grace. What is odd is that Mr. Griffey shows more of both in real life than he does in the book. Apparently he is not getting the ghostwriting he deserves. Laura Mansnerus",1997-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Hellbent,"Inherent in the first Thanksgiving is the idea that God signifies His approval through the dissemination of earthly goods. Through industry and faith, the founding Dissenters believed, America -- and ultimately the world -- could be ordered and made a model of heaven. In the Calvinism of Massachusetts lay the seeds of American energy, of the faith to do all things -- to make steel, build railways and take land from Mexico. What the Dissenters started in the 17th century found its full expression a century later, in the American Revolutionary War. To be the first people to invoke the pursuit of happiness as a goal merely increased the settlers' sense of predestination. Once the life of the republic was assured, the United States could become the secular missionary to the world -- a role that, despite Vietnam, it still feels bound to fulfill. Its leaders seem compelled to pursue the Jeffersonian quest for happiness in Bosnia and Northern Ireland.

Uihlein, and by his nephews, Robert and August Rohe. Mr. Uihlein was preceded in death by his first wife, Mildred Anthony Uihlein, who died on July 9, 1990. He was a grandson of Henry Uihlein who was a longtime president of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company early in this century, and was himself a director of the company for several decades until its sale in 1982 to the Stroh Brewing Company. Mr. Uihlein was born in New York City on February 3, 1896, and attended public and private schools there. A promising collegiate career was cut short by tuberculosis and resulted in his spending several years in Lake Placid, NY, where he was restored to health by the altitude and climate. He married Mildred Anthony of South Orange, NJ, on June 10, 1927, and after an extended European honeymoon, they settled in Montclair, NJ, where he founded a real estate corporation. Summers were spent in Lake Placid. In 1933, the Uihleins moved to New York City where Mr. Uihlein attended to his father's affairs until he died in 1939. In 1941, the Uihleins made Lake Placid their permanent residence, purchasing farm land from the Lake Placid Club which became known as Heaven Hill Farm. Over the succeeding decades, Mr. Uihlein developed a blue ribbon pure-breed Jersey cattle herd, a prize maple syrup operation, and a first class seed potato farm. Stock from his Jersey herd consistently took top prizes at American Jersey Club Shows. Several years ago, the Jersey herd was donated to the Miner Institute of Chazy, NY, where they continue breeding under the Heaven Hill name. Also several years ago, the maple syrup and potato operations were donated to the College of Agriculture of Cornell University under which auspices they continue to be operated as demonstration and research facilities (and in the case of the potato operation, as a disease-free source of seed potatos.) In addition to his interests in fishing, hunting, stamp collecting, and skeet shooting, Mr. Uihlein supported the sport of speed skating in Lake Placid by sponsoring a number of contestants and events, thus contributing to to Lake Placid's reputation as a winter sports resort. He was an official timer at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid and an active supporter of the 1980 Winter Olympics for which he was made an honorary member. In 1983, he was named to the Lake Placid Hall of Fame. Henry Uihlein also liked classic automobiles and undertook the restoration of 2 1939 DeLage automobiles. These automobiles, one a coupe and the other a convertible, are one of a kind and were the stars of the French Pavillion at the 1939 World's Fair. More recently, they have taken top honors at the Concourse D'Legance at Pebble Beach, CA, and other national competitions. Mr. Uihlein has also been actively involved in philanthropy. In addition to funding the Cornell College of Agriculture gifts noted above, he played a major role in the creation of the Uihlein Mercy Center, a geriatric hospital and home located not far from Heaven Hill Farm in Lake Placid. He also has an administration building named after him at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Desert and has served as an honorary Trustee of the Center. He has also actively supported the work of the Mayo Clinic. He will be missed by his many relatives, friends and all those whose lives he touched during his many years. Services will be held on Saturday, June 14th at 11:00 a.m. at the Uihlein Mercy Center Chapel in Lake Placid, interment to follow at North Elba Cemetery, Lake Placid, NY. Memorials may be made to Cornell University College of Agriculture, Uihlein Mercy Center, Lake Placid, NY, Eisenhower Medical Center, Palm Desert, CA, and the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

It appears that the first half of that feat has been achieved by David Buch, a professor of music history at the University of Northern Iowa. Rummaging in a university library in Hamburg, Germany, Dr. Buch found Mozart's name written on a collaborative score for a 1790 opera titled ''The Philosopher's Stone.'' It seems likely that Mozart also had a hand in another score, for ''The Beneficent Dervish,'' an obscure Viennese opera in the fairy-tale manner of ''The Magic Flute,'' composed during his prolific final years.

us,"Goddesses Are Photographed, Not Born","Using lights, innovative film techniques and a painter's eye for composition, George Hurrell transformed mere celebrities into the gods of film, creating many of the most enduring pictures that Hollywood studios ever used to sell movies to America. ''A Hurrell portrait is to the ordinary publicity still what a Rolls-Royce is to a roller skate,'' Esquire wrote in 1936. In HURRELL'S HOLLYWOOD PORTRAITS: The Chapman Collection (Abrams, $39.95), Mark A. Vieira presents 275 of the studio shots Hurrell made from 1929 to 1943, during the beginning of his nearly 70-year career. Mr. Vieira attempts to define Hurrell's technique, but too often he merely describes, in condescending detail, simple technical terms like f-stops, while skimming over more unusual procedures like Hurrell's retouching process. The photographs include Hurrell's first Hollywood portrait (of Ramon Novarro) and the notorious haystack picture of Jane Russell used for Howard Hughes's film ''The Outlaw.'' The shots include not only well-known portraits of legendary stars, finely reproduced, but many lesser known images and almost forgotten personalities, as well as a few surprises, from a partly undraped Jean Harlow to an unretouched Joan Crawford. Cecil B. DeMille compared Hurrell to Rembrandt, and no wonder; under Hurrell's guidance, movie stars became burnished, unreal images. Hurrell described his work simply: ''Bring out the best, conceal the worst, and leave something to the imagination.'' By following this creed, he made the publicity photo into art.

As they proceed on their journey, Victor, who is escaping from an unacknowledged loss, listens to Thierry's fabulous tales of his life and family, of growing up and growing old in Haiti, a country that has been transformed from a place of lush abundance to a sere, mutilated, inhospitable land. But while the two men hunt for the secrets of nature, the macoutes, the deadly thugs who have had so much to do with Haiti's downfall, close in on their own human prey. IN THE PALM OF DARKNESS (HarperCollins, $21), the first of the Cuban-born writer Mayra Montero's four novels to appear in English, is a resplendent piece of writing that brings a mysterious and murderous country throbbingly to life.

Ms. Montero's novel pinpoints the tragedy of the human species as it threatens inexplicably to devour itself, while at the same time exalting the impulses that lead people to live so hungrily, to feel so voraciously.

us,What You See Is What You See,"''In a small town like ours,'' says the high school biology teacher who narrates THE CHURCH OF DEAD GIRLS (Metropolitan Books, $23), Stephen Dobyns's novel about a series of child abductions in a quiet college town in upstate New York, ''something that has happened and something that has not happened but is gossiped about are equivalent.'' In Aurelius, 40 miles from Utica, population 7,000, three young girls have disappeared. The grief and suffering of their families is made real enough, but Dobyns's unnamed narrator focuses his story on the town's increasing anger and suspicion. In this climate of fear, a number of local people find their secrets bared, their smallest differences marking them out for accusations and retaliation. ''The Church of Dead Girls'' is named for its grim opening and closing scenes, depicting the discovery in an attic of the three dead girls in three straight chairs, each missing her left hand. This is a scene born from the demonology of genre fiction, but Dobyns's complex parable of social disintegration (''I see fragility where I had imagined resilience, the fleeting where I'd seen permanence'') fits more into the naturalist mode -- as if Theodore Dreiser had written ''The Lodger'' or a closet serial killer had turned up in Thornton Wilder's Grover's Corners. Dobyns's sad and disquieting novel carries a contemporary moral, true in even the smallest American towns: ''Just as we are only aware of the surface parts of one another's minds, so are we only aware of the surface parts of one another's behavior.''

us,The Looks of Rock,"Pop-music stardom in Britain changed in the mid-1960's. As chronicled in THE END OF INNOCENCE. Photographs From the Decades That Defined Pop: The 1950s to the 1970s (Scalo, $39.95), groups in the early days obligingly did whatever their recording studios told them to; for example, the Beatles are shown cavorting like children in a chorus line on the steps of Abbey Road Studios in 1963, and the Supremes are depicted perching on a rail with furled umbrellas for a foggy London theme. This was assembly-line production, when almost every group from the Hollies to Freddie and the Dreamers seemed to consist of four or five neat lads in skinny ties and dark suits. David Bowie was one of the first performers to break the mold, appearing in street clothes and sneering at the camera. The look caught on; as the book's editor, Liz Jobey, an editor at Scalo, points out, later photos resemble self-portraiture more than they depict the studio's point of view. By 1969 nobody is smiling, and motley groups from Pink Floyd to Deep Purple and Steppenwolf seem to be merely tolerating the camera, rather than performing for it. The reproductions of album covers at the end show a similar shift, from Hollywood-style head shots to covers that didn't even picture the group. The photos are handsomely printed on heavy stock, but leave the reader longing for a bit more text, if only liner notes. Eric Nash",1997-06-22T05:00:00+0000

She was herself a leading example of those principles, educating herself in college and graduate school while working and raising a family following the death of her husband, Malcolm X. All educators everywhere owe a deep debt to her leadership and the inspiration she gave to young people by her teaching, her dedication, and the example of her own life. Columbia is proud to have worked with her for more than a decade in establishing the Malcolm X Memorial Scholarship for minority students at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was proud of the program, and proud of the more than 20 students who have been Malcolm X Scholars and who practice in fields as diverse as anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedic surgery, pediatrics, and medicine. Betty asked these recipients to give something back, in the spirit of her husband, to the less fortunate, medically underserved people of the inner city. In the Malcolm X scholarship program, Columbia commits itself to helping instill the values Dr. Shabazz stood for not only through the work of the Malcolm X Scholarship, but to all students who study medicine and the health professions at Columbia.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  RUTLEDGE, FELIX NOAH, M.D.","RUTLEDGE-Felix Noah, M.D., an internationally known gynecologic surgeon who developed innovative treatments for women with cancer, died on Saturday, June 21, 1997, in Houston, Texas. He was seventy-nine. During his 38-year association with The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Rutledge helped improve the outlook for thousands of women with gynecologic cancers. He was at the forefront in designing conservative, individualized cancer therapy that extended survival and reduced post-surgical complications. He was born in Anniston, Alabama, on November 20, 1917, the only son of Josie and Felix Noah Rutledge, Sr. He began planning to study medicine as a youth. He received an undergraduate degree at the University of Alabama in 1939 and earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1943. He completed an internship and residence training in three specialty areas at Johns Hopkins Hospital before moving to Houston. Dr. Rutledge joined the M.D. Anderson staff in 1948 on a part-time basis. At that time, patients were seen in temporary quarters on an old family estate while the first hospital facility was being planned and built in the then-new Texas Medical Center. He became the first chairman of the Department of Gynecology when M.D. Anderson opened in 1954 and continued in that post until he retired in 1986. Dr. Rutledge was instrumental in developing the Department of Gynecology at M.D. Anderson into one of the nation's most productive academic training centers. He was widely acclaimed for his work in pelvic exenteration, as well as poineering less radical methods to remove cancers and preserve patient function and body image. In addition to his surgical and teaching skills, Dr. Rutledge designed clinical trials that demonstrated conclusively the superior results of applying multidisciplinary therapy to treat many forms of gynecologic cancer. His research led to extensive publications in leading professional journals and contributions to several textbooks. As a teacher, he personally trained over 100 post-graduate fellows in gynecologic oncology, many of whom have gone on to hold senior academic positions in medical institutions around the world. In 1970, the physicians he trained honored him by establishing the Felix Rutledge Society. The Society's purpose, to share new developments in gynecologic oncology and to stimulate original investigation in gynecologic oncology and to related fields, mirrors Dr. Rutledge's philosophy and values in the practice and art of medicine. A member of all societies of his specialties as well as many other medical societies, Dr. Rutledge served as President of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists in 1975, President of the American Radium Society in 1976, and President of the Society of Pelvic Surgeons in 1979. He was one of five physicians who created the Subspecialty of Gynecologic Oncology for the American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Dr. Rutledge received many honors and awards throughout his life including the Janeway Medal, American Radium Society (1982); the Distinguished Service Award, American Cancer Society (1985); the Heath Memorial Award (1985); Fellow of the Society of Scholars, Johns Hopkins University (1994); Honoris Causa in Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy (1994); Honoris Causa, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain (1997); Honorary Fellow, Royal College of Obstetrics & Gynecology of Great Britain; and Honorary Fellow, Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology of South Africa. He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Wood Rutledge of Geneva, Texas, his son and daughter-inlaw, Don and Melanie Rutledge of Sugar Land, Texas, and two grandsons, Kevin Scott Rutledge and Travis Matthew Rutledge also of Sugar Land. Services and interment will be held on Saturday, June 28, at 11:00 A.M. at McMahan Chapel near San Augustine, Texas, under the direction of the Starr Funeral Home of Hemphill.

C. & Company, with Chinese employees in Western dress, probably looked unusual in 1860, while the disjunction of the Chinese street with the Western plague inspectors in white may appear even stranger to later, more culturally homogenous generations than to us. Which is odder, native servants in traditional garb, or Asian streets that look like Rome or Madrid? That Europeans presumed to remake the world in their image, or that there were once cultures that owed nothing to Western ideas or aesthetics?

The design looks sensitive enough -- it's a simple earthen mound incorporating bronze ''tracings'' of three warriors -- but Wells says that the proposed placement, about 20 yards from a monument to the slain 7th Cavalry, is ''right out of hell.'' Gerard Baker, who is part Mandan and part Hidatsa Indian and the park's superintendent, replies that it is also the will of Congress, which mandated a privately financed monument in 1991.

us,A Movable Farce,"Delightful and decidedly goofy, Jean Echenoz's novel BIG BLONDES (New Press, $22) has one at its center -- the fleetingly famous chanteuse Gloria Stella (nee Gloire Abgrall), who fled from the public eye upon the suspicious demise of her agent-lover. Her seclusion is complete until a trash television producer named Paul Salvador picks up the trail while in pursuit of his two abiding interests: ''What ever happened to?'' celebrity stories and the blondes of the book's title. When Salvador's private detectives begin closing in, Gloire reacts with feral rage, hurling one of her pursuers off a cliff and leading the rest on a chase from Paris to Sydney to Bombay. In Mark Polizzotti's translation from the original French, Echenoz's modus operandi is parody played so broadly it occasionally borders on farce; he delights in savaging mass media cliches like television docudramas or action-adventure movies. Though these are not new or difficult targets, Echenoz dispatches them with gleeful silliness. He doesn't spare his own work in the process, using sporadic asides to treat his novel as cavalierly as any of his other subjects. ''We already know the deal,'' he writes at one point, ''so let's get this over with quickly and move on.'' What's not to like about such a considerate author? Liam Callanan",1997-06-29T05:00:00+0000

There are now more than 200 in the United States, according to Janet Rice Elman, executive director of the Association of Youth Museums in Washington.

Kertess, an adjunct curator for drawings at the Whitney Museum of American Art, does a wonderful job of re-creating the context in which Mitchell (1926-92) first made her mark -- the heavily male-dominated New York art world of the 1950's, when Pollock and de Kooning and heavy drinking reigned supreme. Both artists had an impact on her, as did van Gogh, Cezanne and Matisse. The poet Frank O'Hara was among her friends, as was Samuel Beckett later in Paris. Poetry and nature inspired her work, which Kertess describes by calling the ''precarious balance between vastness and containment, storminess and order'' a ''hallmark of Mitchell's paintings.'' A passionate, sometimes irascible woman, Mitchell in her will directed Kertess to write the text for this volume, which includes 120 color plates; it is the most complete study of her work to date.
